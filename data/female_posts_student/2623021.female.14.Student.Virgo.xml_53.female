Suzy came over to my dads house around 1:30 or so, and we went to the Sandpark and Lon showed us all the pictures of us from the last afterhours (cute) and then the movie of us all sandboarding (again cute) and then we called Jordan and he came out and hung out with us and we headed out to the dunes and we did a couple runs and then we all crashed in the sand and sunbathed and kept warm and we layed there for around an hour and a half or two hours, then we went back to the Sandpark building and hung out there for a while, (someone was ACTUALLY talking to me who usually doesn't, it was nice) and then Suzy and I headed off to my moms house, and then put on our wetsuits (well not ours but yeah) and went swimming in the lake, it was great we couldn't go far under the water and we came up with fun water games :)  Then Jordan came over and we were all pretty tired so we went down to the lake house and crashed for a bit, (after swimming some more) and he left around midnight and Suze and I went to bed around 12:30. We got woken up by a bunch of people calling at 8-10 about some wood, and finally it got to the point where we couldn't go back to sleep. So we watched Life or Something Like It. Then cleaned the lake house. Then Tori called me and asked if I wanted to go to Yahats with her, (she is the only high schooler I am allowed to ride with) and we went and bought a cute black and white hat, and then we bought a lunch and had a picnic on the beach, and got some ice cream and talked about how stupid guys can be, and how I want to have a summer fling in Maine, and her in Georgia. Should be amazing fun.  Then I came home and helped my mom pack for Maine. Well I g2g ciao
