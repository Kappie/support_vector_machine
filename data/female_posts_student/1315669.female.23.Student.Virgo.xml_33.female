Thoughts that ain't distinct, more like smeared ink that has no finite context yet they whirl around stilfling you.   Maybe it's because of the fact that I din slp well at all for the past several nites; slping late and waking a couple of times in the nite and waking up early..in a scaringly routinous way. Or perhaps it's because of the fact that I'm very discouraged and dissappointed in certain peeps that are close to me; in their way of dealing with their lives and in their choice of denial.   Who am I to judge? *luffs* I myself is one big walking contradictory big-headed and conceited creature. Perhaps I'm frowning at people who are doing things alike to me that I have conveniently chosed to ignore my wrongdoings but penalizing those as I see the mirror of ers done by them. I'm such a sad creature. Tsk. Yet I can;t ignore the fact that some things are bothering me. Especially about 2 people in my life that had been close to me. Somehow, I felt that I have to withheld my presence of trust in these frenships. I can't really comprehend why I emotionally reacted this way. My 1st reaction was that of unpleasant surprise which gave way to a huge wave of disappointment and then exasperation. It's like standing oblivious to the mice nibbling on the food right under my very nose and I do not know cos' I'm so BLIND. Sighz.. Trust..such a strong word, has seemingly lost its significance now. Trust in what sense? I can't pin point.   Lately, once again, my right side of the brain has decided to revive it's engine and reduced me to the nostalgic and melancholic self I used to be. Doesn't seemed to have any harmful side effects now but I've an inkling that it doesn't seemed to have much of a pleasant consequnce if I allow it to carry on from here. Certain songs, smells, objects stirred up and strum my heartstrings and with that I embarked on a journey of my delusionalized matrix that held me so dear that the reality seemed so cruel.   Sighz, whatever happened to logic? Maybe mine is taking a short break now..ight come back soon..only if i'm patient....
