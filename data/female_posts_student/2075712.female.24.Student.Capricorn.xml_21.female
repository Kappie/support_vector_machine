This weekend I'm going to do my rounds with my whole family.  I've been out of the loop in visiting my family for a month or two but it seems like  forever .   Tomorrow, I'm going to my Real Estate Principles 101 class in the morning and then I'm going to take a hike in Griffith Park.  After that I'll probably visit my Grandma C just to hang out with her and play cards.  Then I'll probably go out on Sat. night...just not sure where.  On Sunday, I absolutely  MUST  visit my Grandma A...she has been very sick and I fear that she may be leaving us soon...=(   I pray that she gets better...  I know it's a part of life but to be honest I just don't know how the hell to deal with it.  I've been trying to prepare myself since I know that she is very old and now she is very sick...to top it off, she won't visit a doctor.  She is very opinionated and stubborn, but more than anything she is the biggest sweetheart  ever .  I've been very lucky...to this point in my life I have not dealt with the loss of someone who I'm extremely close to.  I know there is no avoiding it but I'm scared.  I'm scared for my grandpa who will be left alone.  I'm scared for my mother who is losing her mother.  I'm scared because I won't have be able to see her anymore.  I guess this is my way of attempting to prepare myself for the inevitable.  I've heard sayings before that mean something to the effect of...don't worry about death until it comes..but I'm afraid that it may be too much for me to handle if I don't start getting prepared.  Although, I am attempting to prepare myself...I hope and pray that my grandmother will get better and live to see another 10 years.  When I go visit her, I will try to convince her to let me take her to a doctor...and then maybe she'll get better.
