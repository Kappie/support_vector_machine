No idea.  But I know it intrigues me.  There are clubs around here, but I do not frequent them, only because they are pretty skanky. Kind of like  Easy Skanin'   by Bob Marley.   Excuse me while I light my spliff.    OK, sitting here cracking up over something I told Sod last night and now I have to share to the unknown.  Do we all know what the Honor Guard is?  For those who do not, the Honor Guard are the guys who come out to special functions, ie. parades, funerals and the like, to perform the 21 Gun Salute. So the South Bend Tribune had an article about a parade in Plymouth.  Apparently the Firing Squad was going to be there, instead of the Honor Guard.  Anyone want to join me?  Didn't think so.  Oh man, this story was so much better this morning at 1:30am.  Wait, when did I talk to Sod?  God, I can not remember what time it was.  I remember half getting the story out, half cracking up and tears rolling down my cheek.   Big game tonight.  D Town and the Rapers.  ps.  Grey  hates  the Lakers.  This chick who sits behind me in psychology said tonight and I quote, "Kobe is amazing!".  I wanted to turn around and ask if it was amazing he cheated on his wife.  I'm not mad though.  At this point, I just want the Pistons to beat some Laker arse.  Yeah, arse.  I can spell, but arse comes from the Misho term meaning ass.  Got it?  Good.  Who is Misho?  Well, nevermind that.  Whoa, I cant believe I just spotted him a name drop.  Gah!   .....went to the funeral for superflys mom this afternoon.  I don't know about you, but when I go to funerals, I just think about every other one I've been to and it just makes it that much worse.  My cousin showed up and then all I thought about was last year at her dads funeral.  So then I drove home on 2, in the rain and went to class, took the quiz, which I only missed one, and then headed to my uncles sisters viewing.  Funeral is tomorrow.   I have no Joys of So and Mo today since I dropped them off at 11:30 this morning and just now got home an hour ago.  Pretty soon it will be shower and bed time.  Then Mommy time.  Whatever that means.  I need suggestions. I think that should do it for tonight.  Oh wait---  My Milkshake is better than yours.  Damn right!  Whoa, ho, what did I just admit to?                   I'll feed you fruit that don't exist                        I'll leave graffiti                   Where you've never been kissed                        I'll do your laundry                          Massage your soul                         I'll turn you over                        To the highway patrol    PEACE.LOVE.DMB.  | 8 days! |
