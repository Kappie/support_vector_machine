I don't know how he feels about anything besides that he kissed me about two weeks ago when he was drunk and he didn't want things to "get weird". Strange. Is it worth it to have crushes and like guys? Is all this agonizing over someone really worth the time? I'm thinking no. I'm thinking of how much I want to strangle him for not getting it. Ugh. I don't have much more to say because I don't want to think about him anymore. Or this dating bullshit.
