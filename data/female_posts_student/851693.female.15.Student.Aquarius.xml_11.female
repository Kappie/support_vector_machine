We finished the chinese script quite some time ago, so all I have to do now at present is to finish my Luling role.     what i did     1)Started memorizing my lines about 2 weeks ago... but it doesn't really work unless we try it out together   2)Attended some rehearsals... but we don't seem to be progressing. the most recent rehearsal didn't differ much from those a few weeks back.        reflection    i was quite surprised when i first read the comments and reflections posted by everyone else because they are so positive. why does everyone find the rehearsals fun? i really don't see how. So far, i find myself not sinking into this production, not involving myself. The production is due within a month is it? I don't seem to feel anything.    And the rehearsals... how exactly are we supposed to improve? and is it just me with a problem and that we are actually progressing just that i don't see it? because the english scenes seem to be going very fine, and the chinese ppl find rehearsals fun.        what i have to do    be more involved? haven't figured out how yet, but i suppose the attitude is v. important because apparently mine is all wrong and i have no idea what i am doing.       i don't get it. i really don't get it. how in the world do people look forward to rehearsals and have fun?     i am very lost... happy national day
