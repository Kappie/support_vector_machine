    
       Space Shuttle Columbia destroyed, crew of 7 dead. Returning from a 16 day mission. Debris scattrered over Texas.  A terrible tragedy for America and the space program and what does Max say? Shit happens. In that case if you ever die in a car accident or any other way what will be said on you gravestone? Shit happens. That is so inconsiderate. So fucking rude.
