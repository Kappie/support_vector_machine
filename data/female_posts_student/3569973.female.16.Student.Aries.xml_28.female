So right now I'm super happy for some reason. I woke up this morning and well seeing as I already wrote...then ya dont need to know about this morning. Well I left at about 10 after seeing Jake before he left for two days. Then I went on the hunt for a job. lol. You will not believe what kinda places there are out there. I never even realized half of those places were ever there. Well I got home at about 12:30. Then I watched a movie and went to go pick up my dad from fort worth. I got back and Royal Pizza called and asked me to go up there. Well turns out I start work there again when school starts, but I kinda dont wanna work there because I dont wanna miss any football games because this is Jakes last year. Then I came back and worked on my shirts and stuff and cleaned up my room while I waited for a friend to get here, well then we went to another friends house to do some stuff and I actually have never laughed soo hard in my ENTIRE LIFE...well thats a lie...but I laughed alot and talked about things. Well it was great. I came home and am still laughing. I cant wait until tomorrow because I get to go shopping and then I get to get ready to go out with Brandy and Jess to the movies and stuff. Its gonna be great. Things are actually starting to make sense. Things are fun and Im guessing how there supposed to be because I dont have a problem with a thing. Well except with Hypocrites...but thats it...well wait...and stupid people, and people that dont really know things that which they speak of. You would know if you were there...lmao. Its great. Well Im gonna get back to my fun go happy life. But I knew that I would have to write in here now because I wouldnt have time later. So Till then, Later Days
