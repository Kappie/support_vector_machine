It was very funny, go check it out. And Bruce, my crazy old neighbor who ran over a cop and then fled the scene, is out of the crazy house. Congratulations, Bruce. I woke up and my mom informed me we were going to go get Indian food. She gave me a John Kerry sticker and button, and I got really excited! But she doesn't want me to wear them in Texas. She thinks I'll get radical and, like Emmit Till, come home without my face. It probably will happen.  Then we went to the Victoria's Secret bra sale. And by sale, they mean four bras cost 80 some dollars.  I have to babysit tonight and I'd really rather read  Harry Potter . I didn't realize how much stuff they left out of the third movie, but they left out a lot. P.S. Anna, if you are reading this, I'm telling you we are going to go see it on our trip! I'm listening to Story of the Year, they are really good and it's refreshing to hear them again. Sorry this entry is boring, I'm gonna go now. Bye.
