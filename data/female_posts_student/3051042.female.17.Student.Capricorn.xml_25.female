Talked about hacking into the admin computers and changing our grades. I think the attendance office is our best bet. ;-) We returned for 6th hour, but as I walked into the room Mr. Ball was our substitute so I left, headed to the art room to talk grades with Ms. Evans. Apparently I'm failing because I don't have my fucking watercolor in. I started painting. Figured she was being such a bitch and decided to steal the watercolor paints and a few paint brushes (even though I've pilfered so much stuff from the art stock room already). Oh well...  So I had an interesting feeling today. I was walking to the band hall after second lunch and everyone that was walking the opposite direction was familiar to me. I knew everyone's name. Just knowing people is like some exciting experience for me. I was painting the announcements on the window in the media center 4th hour and as some kid came by and slammed his fist against the window (trying to screw up my Seniors Last Day annoucement) the entire humanities class (which was in the media center at the time) wanted to get up and kill the kid, I thought it was hilarious. PEOPLE CARE. It's so odd. Andrea complemented my skills of painting backwards. I blushed and thanked her.   Ash has been a little strange lately. I guess she slept with someone while down in Key West and only remembers waking up with the person. She got a pregnancy test and she's alright. We both talked about Keith. She's still not over him. I told her of how I at once contemplated if I wanted to be with Keith or Allen after high school. She said I worry too much. The story of my life. She also told me to try and be happy, but agreed that I'm happier since the break up. I told her about the unimportance of my happiness, she wanted to strangle me.    Nick and I talked last night. It was scary on my part. I'm just not used to things like this.  And yes, I flipped out. I promised myself I wouldn't. I just don't want to deal with things so I push them aside. He told me not to run from things. I'm so acquainted with running, sometimes just seems like the best thing. No one usually sees me run away though, and that's why it's so natural. No one really cares that much to look in my direction. With exception of Tiki, but she usually follows me back to my corner and sits with me until things feel a little better. This isn't going to go away is it?   On to other things I guess. Leah and Wyatt are dating or something. "Here's your gift..." *randomly make out* I was drop jawed... Kayleigh looked at me as if she'd known about this for awhile. I guess, oh what's his name.... that Davey guy is out of the picture. Go back to Gabriel Richard to which you came from. Asshole...  I have too much homework. Wind Symphony is going to the East and West middle school's tomorrow. No 2nd-4th hours for me... I just realized something, what are we going to play? Both Plato's Cave and Pirates of the Caribbean suck. Thanks for making us look like retarded band fags Snydee. I confessed to her that band isn't on my course selection sheet for next year. I think she was going to cry.  Band - B Art - D (this will change due to water color painting submitting) Advanced Algebra - C (I need to study for that test on Wednesday) Media Aide - Satisfactory English - ? Forensics - ?  I need a 3.5 by the end of this week. Hey Gareth, can I take you up on that offer? I'm getting no sleep tonight. Homework. Homework. Homework.
