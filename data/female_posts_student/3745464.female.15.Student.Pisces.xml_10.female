So then at four i went and got Mc Donlads and rented Teaxs Chainsaw Masscure and The Butter Fly Effect. Then i came home and jackie came over again because once again we thought thomas was coming. Then she left and Kate came over and we watched Teaxs Chainsaw Masscure but it was the old one so i didn't want to watch it. Then i smoked pot. so then kate is staying the night tonight. Tomorrow: I have to go to the mall with lacey tomorrow around 11:00 then i have to come home and call thomas (who now is in town) and then i get to hang out with him eric and terri hopefully. So my day should be fun and exciting! lol i dunno though...but ill write more later im going to go and watch the butterfly effect for the 19th time! (not kidding)...so ill write more later.
