I have like literally a dozen different blogs, half of which I know I have but have forgotten completely about (if that makes any sense.)  I really have no purpose for this blog.  I mean seriously, I can't think of anything.  I've got a blog that chronicles normal daily life, and the same one that holds my rants and random tirades when I feel angry or sarcastic (because yes, some mornings I do wake up feeling sarcastic), and I have another blog that is for the deeper workings (i.e. things that scare me, trouble me, personal problems...), and then another exclusively for fan fictions and other literate workings of the sort.  I don't really need this one.  But I wanted it.  Because I like starting new things.  Like sentences.  Even when by doing so I totally throw off.  The whole continuity of a sentence.  Uhhh...  I got two new CDs at Target today... which is cool...  Uhhh... I'm going to go biking when my mom gets home... which is also cool...  Uhhh... My fat neighbors have a rockslide for their pool and I can see their blubberly cadavers flopping around over the top of my fence... which is uncool...  ...KMart smells.  Love, Molly
