Collapse   The world upon my shoulders The sea beneath my feet Take me away, for now, forever Bitter life and none to meet  The stars above are fading The grass below is dry The flam within my spirit Flickers, whispers, dies  What have I done to you, my love? And how will you react? What has the world become, my love? What whips must they still crack?  Your sun is sweet and scorching My moon is light for some Daylight fade and night breaks down My world, for darkness come  A light in chill church flickers No candle, lamp nor flame Silver moth seeks its path To escape to meet those same
