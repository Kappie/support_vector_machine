I haven't the energy to go out and there's nothing to do at home except either watch TV (despite having about 300 channels the best thing on this afternoon is The Father Dowling Mysteries, which says a lot) or mess about with this damn thing.   Speaking of this damn thing; having been averaging about 20 hits a day for the first week or two it is now averaging about 3 hits a day, which isn't helping my mood. Now I'm under no illusions about what a boring pile of crap it is, but there are plenty of even worse ones that can at least manage double figures. I think I shall have to become a search engine whore (yes, even more than I already have) and use *interesting* keywords like "porn" and "XXX" to try and generate some interest.   In the meantime, though, if you've even vaguely enjoyed my blog then PLEASE link back to it. And if you don't have a blog of your own, go buy some of my  Blogshares . They're really good value, honest!
