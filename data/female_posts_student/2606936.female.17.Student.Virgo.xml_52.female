I had left some "dead" ones up in the hopes that they would update that nifty bloglinker thing, but alas, they have probably been lost.  people don't live forever, and we often get bored with our activities. So some of those great-blogs-that-i-don't-read-daily-but-are-still-good-reading are going to be seriously missed.  SO, the first installment of the informal obituaries, as best I can remember.....  ORFINANNY AND AUSTIN http://orfinanny.blogdrive.com  This writer guy, Austin, had this cool thing going where he invented the "perfect" woman, Orfinanny, and they supposedly wrote a blog together. Lots o' political stuff, and lots o' humor. Woe, woe, woe to the dead duo. I can only assume that one of the guys who envied Orfie killed Austin off and they ran away to St. Bart's.  STRATFORD-UPON-AVON: THE TRUTH http://atowngoesdown.blogspot.com  This other guy, he lives(d?!?!?) in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, which is that place where that writer guy (not Austin) wurde geboren. So, he had some neat observations about life in the famous place. And also some neat observations on life in general. Some tourist probably shot him or something. It may very well have been my English teacher.  A DAY IN THE LIFE http://adayinthelifeat.blogspot.com  Ok, I didn't read this that often, but it was cool because this lady linked to me early on and I was flattered that someone read me. She had survived cancer and wrote cool stuff about her life - just not necessarily that humorous. Still, twas good. I have no idea how she "died" - I seriously hope it wasn't cancer. Probably just bored from reading about MY life.  shit. I can't remember who else died. Seems like there were more....  Well, uhh, just remember this, bloggers:              Do not ask for whom the bell tolls - it tolls for thee.   (And if you didn't figure out which writer guy was born in STratford-upon-Avon, you either a) got confused by my German or b) are an idiot who shouldn't be allowed to speak English.)  EDIT -  urlLink ORFIE LIVES! ORFIE LI-HI-HI-HIIIIIIIIIIVES!
