That's why I became friends with Louisa and Logan, whom I now choose to call LouLou and Logie. Whom I choose? Who I choose? I've forgotten all English.  I'm sure Tiff will correct me tomorrow or some other point in the near future, and Wincy'll give me a thorough lecture re-explaining the grammatical structure of both words.  Who needs tutors when you have Summit classmates?  Raaaaaamble.  Ok, back to my original point, Ellie's random humour amuses me.  The title of this entry is a classic quote of hers.  Some other popular Ellie classics include "AWKWAAAAAAAARD" and "So...how 'bout that cheese, eh?" Hah.  Wooowww, I don't think I've ever written such an unsound entry point-wise.  I'll shut up while I'm ahead. Or...yeah.  I'll do that.
