I will pay all of you very well, especially since this order will allow me to make a very valuable prize: Adamant (addy) bars. With this, I can make Addy daggers, which sell for almost 800 gp a piece. Therefore, for every 700gp worth of coal, we make more than 800 gp. Nothin' but profit. I can provide all of my own addy for now, but you will all soon be able to help me. According to the high scores listings, if you all gather 1/3 of both materials, your levels will increase as follows:  Aeri87: 212295 (Lv. 57) -> 735335 (Lv. 69) Chaobreeder: 756227 (Lv. 70) -> 1279267 (Lv. 75) Freya 55: 123400 (Lv. 51) -> 646400 (Lv. 68)  Note: Isn't it odd that the same amount of XP can raise one player 17 whole lvls and another only 5?  My order is as follows: 22,416 coal, 5,604 mithril. Thanks for helping if you feel like it, and if you don't, that's fine, tell me and I can give you increased XP values depending on how many of us quit. As an incentive, I will be paying based on a ratio of materials to time. Whosoever get the most materials in the least time gets paid in the least time. Who ever comes in second will be paid second, and so forth.
