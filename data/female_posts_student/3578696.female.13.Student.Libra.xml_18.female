Fallin' out, fallin' in  Nothing's sure in this world, no no  Breaking down, breaking in  Never knowin' what lies ahead  We can really never tell it all, no no   Say goodbye, say hello  To a lover or friend  Sometimes we never could understand  Why some things begin with just love  We can really never have it all, no no hoh hoh   But, oh, can't you see  That no matter what happens,  life goes on and on  And so, baby, just smile  'Cause I'm always around you  And I'll make you see how beautiful life is for you and me   Take a little time, baby  See the butterfly's colors  Listen to the birds that sent to sing for me and you  Can you feel me  This is such a wonderful place to be   Even if there is pain now  Everything will be alright  For as long as the world still turns,  there will be night and day   Can you hear me  There's a rainbow always after the rain   Hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh   Hittin' high, hittin' low  Win or lose you should go, yeah yeah
