Ben didn't come over. I was kind of looking forward to just hanging out,   just because I don't really have anything else to do. It's alright   though...I've been doing stuff for the past two days and I need to be   by myself for a little bit. Oh, he was going to burn me Big  Rich   too...haha, I'm a hick! He bought it yesterday and we listened to it the   whole time. I started to like it after listening to it 9 times.    We went to Rockford yesterday. We were looking for a store w/   "paranormal" stuff in it. It wasn't really what we thought...there were just   a bunch of witch books. That stuff creeps me out. We also went to   Low's...they were looking for an EMF detector or something. We couldn't   find one. Then we ate at Catina, or something. A nice, cute boy   waited on us... :). When we came back to town, we went swimming and it was  crazy. We played MarcoParker....basically Marco Polo with some   adjustments.   I'm sneaky, let me tell you .   I think I'm going to go see Anchorman tonight. I heard it was bad but   there's nothing much of anything else to do. Plus, I haven't done anything    with Sarah in a few days. I'm broke too, movies are basically the only  thing I can do without having money.   Besides staying home, and that is   boring when I've already been doing that all day. This whole post, I've   just come to realize is about nothing. It's boring, but that's me. Um...I   have my senior pictures tomorrow, hopfully I don't look like a monster.   They usually do a pretty good job of making ugly FAs look decent,   so I think I'll be ok.   //*\\And if these are my parting words, then make this my last request.   Hold me here, until I sleep//*\      ...until next time
