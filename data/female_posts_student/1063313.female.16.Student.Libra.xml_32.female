Soo, i was like "well me and anna are---(i get cut off..)" and she GOES ON AND ON. and THEN she makes me repeat basically everything she said b/c she thought i was just sittin there sayin "yes yes yes okay" a million times and THEN she told me that i should NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN ask ANY of the reibers for ANYTHING and if i want ANYTHING she's gonna take me to the games and w/e. so THEN i have to go BACK inside and tell mrs. r. that i cant go and mrs. r. was like "wha-- i told ur mom in the office that you asked if i could take you and she kinda looked suprised (and pissed, lol i'm addin that i just cant put in words what she did. lol)" and then i told her that it was b/c (she asked why) b/c my mom thinks that "your" takin personally what's happenin between me and anna (i left out that my mom said mrs. r. was bein mean to her) and that i shouldnt be askin and w/e.. and so then i walk back to my car (and julie sticks her toungue out at me so i had to do that back, and i think my mom got worse after that lol) and so i get in the car and my mom CONTINUES until mrs. r. comes out there (tho, when i was talkin to mrs. r. i told her not to say what i said to her b4 i left her) so mrs. r. comes out there and is like nice and kinda and sweet to my mom and was like "it's okay we can still take her, i mean ashley doesnt ask me for anything as much or invites herself as much w/ me as much as anna did to yall" and my mom's like"no no, she needs to learn not ask that kinda crap (what the-- i mean, the r.'s are like my other family, since WHEN did my mom start sayin THAT crap?!?!?!) so mrs. r. was like "well if you change ur mind..." and my mom was like "well we'll just do this another time" and mrs. r "this is the last game" my mom "we'll do this another time" (i swear they both said the same thing 5 times in 5 diff ways) so then mrs. r. leaved and i expect my mom to start screamin again. she was freakin me out. and she was also drivin like a WILD women. honestly. gezz i wish i got to go to that game.. uhhh i really hate my mom.. and also, my mom when she was screaming i know the people outside the car and around it were prolly listenin. and her voice was crackin she was screamin so loud. now i have to go tell my dad, cause that's really freaky. and i REALLY want to go to the game. this is the last time. but in my mom's words "she'll do this again" WHEN exactly will i be able to do this again? seeing as how this is the LAST FRIGGIN GAME?!?! gezz i really hate my mom right now. and i swear if anybody posts about how i should be wrong in the situation i will literally lay down and die. either that or jump THRU the comp and come after you with a VERY sharp...um.. pencil. yes. lol, okay toodles~~
