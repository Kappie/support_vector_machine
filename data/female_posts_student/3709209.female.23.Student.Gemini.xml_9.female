(or am i haunting him in my dreams?) at first it was nice ‘n sexy and all that jazz, but now that i’m just trying to move on it’s kinda creepy. am i a stalker at heart, soul and mind? should i just except my subconscious wannabe gr.10 teenage punkster-grrl G-lovin’ self? or, is there some sort of MM mind feng shui i should do to exercise my G-mons?
