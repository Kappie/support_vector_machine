I get stuck. (every fucking time. )   I start to wonder why I bother  to count the days when I think of it,  you might just be far away marking down the tally  till you can¡¦t remember these days (my face)   if I cant cry the tears because they wont come out  does that mean that my body remembers what you are about  (really knows what the deal is?)  this body has been keeping count of these things  I¡¦ve been taking for granted (it counts)  how many tears I've shed (how many were wasted.)  it recalls the things you said (even remembers what you meant.)   every time that I was gone in the head,  it could see thru (my alcohol blurred vision)  to the reason why you would only approach me  when I was stuck in a drunken daze (stuck, drunken and stuck)      (--they wouldnt let me leave, it was the only thing i could need--)  (-the only thing I need, never let me leave-)  (the only thing could never need, they wouldn¡¥t let me leave)  trying to (and succeeding) rebuild this dependency  (this dependency) was slowly dying with that part of me   always had that way to know when my defenses were down, (all fall down)  so you could slip yourself back in (so you could always stay around.)  you'd never be forgotten. (left in the lost and found)       one sentence, expands itself into a thousand forgotten forevers. your memory plays on repeat, yet negates everything you should remember about you and me.        -whomever i choose to be.
