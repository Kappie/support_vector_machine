Things are definitely looking up. Also, my room is still clean. How weird is that?   Still trying to stick to the significant stuff and for today that'd be the missed school. I've only ever skipped school in the normal way once, and even then I just ended up hiding in my bedroom. (My mom caught me when I came down to pee though, so that doesn't exactly count.) However, my  variation  on school-skipping occurs much more often. It's rather like what Henna used to do all the time. Emphasis on the past tense; she insists that she's all clean now. Uh, sure. Whatever. Anyway, for her missing school is necessary whenever her mom needs her for something essential, like shopping or as company to a doctor's appointment. For me, it's when I'm tired or stressed or just want an extra day to catch up on homework. It's quite simple actually. All I have to do is persuade my mother to let me stay home from school. Since both Henna and me are on best-friend status with our mummies, it's easier than it sounds. It's not exactly manipulation though; if my mom insists on my going I will. However, I'd say that when I try to get out of school there's a 2:1 chance, in my favor, that I'll get my way. All of this is the easy part.   My dad is my mom's opposite on discipline issues. Since she knows my sister and I so well, she's inclined to be a bit lax, while my dad doesn't like to let anything slip by. This means that my mom'll often go behind his back to let us do what we want, like watching TV 'til 11 or missing school. I know this sounds like crap parenting, but your friends wouldn't want to be mean to you, right? Just think of it that way. So anyway, whenever I stay home from school I have to hide from my dad. It's a huge adrenaline rush, way scary, and I would love it if I was that sort of person. But, as I'm not, I hate it. And he catches me 3/4 of the time. That was what happened today.   My mom went upstairs to get Ian (my brother) ready for school, with the promise that she'd be back out soon. I chose to ignore her advice to come in, and instead scrunched up in the bottom of the truck, positive that my mom would be out soon and my dad wouldn't see me even if he did leave before my mom. (He usually goes to work around 11 am; he owns his own business. He works 'til like 1 in the morning though; that's how we can do things behind his back. I feel kind of bad about it, but who would act any differently given the opportunity to do as they pleased?) So anyway, there I was in the bottom of the truck. God, I can be so stupid. Sometimes the truth is so unpleasant that I can make myself believe something completely ridiculous just so I won't have to face the facts. I mean, he walks right past that truck on the way to the car! How could he  not  see me?   So I'm scrunched down and I look up through the window and there he is, angry as hell. This is the part where I start panicking. All I remember is sticking my fingers in my ears, closing my eyes, and thinking  Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit . It was the scariest thing ever. I'm not sure how much time passed, but the next thing I knew my dad was back, yelling (though with my fingers in my ears I couldn't really hear) and shaking the truck a bit. Later my mom told me that in the time that'd passed he'd come upstairs and yelled at her. I ended up opening the truck door and making a run for the house, bookbag in tow. I left my shoes behind though. Once upstairs I started crying hysterically and asking my mom what happened and how did he find out? I am such a wimp. I got exactly what I deserved for being so deceitful. Whatever. It turned out okay anyway. He forgave me, I think; at least he hasn't mentioned it since I've been home.   I ended up going to work with my mom (two  hours  later). She maintains gardens downtown. I didn't end up getting much homework done though. My mom spent the day showing around this visitor from the UK, so I was talking with them, and then later I got lunch with my mom and talked with her. I did okay though. I should really be in bed now, seeing as I have to get up in like 7 hours and I only got 5 hours of sleep last night, but I guess I'm gonna have to sacrifice for this thing. And considering that not one person besides myself has yet seen my blog that's pretty pathetic, but whatever.   Currently Reading:  Peops  by Fly. My mom and I disagreed on how to pronounce this book's title. I said 'pee-yops' while she insisted that it was simply 'peeps'. She's probably right, but I don't really think the author would care one way or another. It's basically a series of rough sketches of random people/friends of the author that are surrounded by bits of conversations the author had with them. They're lovely little slices of life. The ones of children are the best; while the adults are tough, punk-ish people, the children are adorable and talk about things like their loose teeth and tests. It's like a breath of fresh air. I'd recommend this book if you like my blog at least a tiny bit, if you like comics at least a little bit, and if you're open-minded and not offended by swearing.   Less than 24 hours until I reach Java Junkie heaven!
