I have to go to my partner's house at 11am!!!  I love my partner, but i don't like the 11am part.....oh well, i'll live.  Today, my pen ran out of ink and i had to bring my Magic 8 Ball pen to school and in all of my classes we were asking it life questions.....it was amusing.  Adam Hartwick, in Geometry, was SO FUNNY!!!!  The kid acted like he was on drugs but it was hilarious.  He was making up magic tricks and showing them to us and i have no idea why it was so funny but it was.  He was bugging the hell out of me and Cheryl and we told him that we liked him better asleep, but he just kept on annoying us.  he's usually REALLY quiet, but i guess today he decided to be outgoing.  i don't know how his girlfriend puts up with him.    Tonight is a hockey game at 9:30 vs. Highland Park.  Yay.  Here's the group that's going: Me, Brittany, Brittnee, Jess (if she's not babysitting), Emily (friend from the stars games), and Lauren (if her parents will let her).  You should all come, its bound to be fun!  Stars also play tonight against Colorado.  Personally, i think we're going to lose.  But ya know, the Stars always seem to find ways to surprised me when i seriously think their screwed, so who knows.  Game time for that is 8pm on ESPN.  That means i get to watch the Stars possibly work themselves into a pit for about a period and a 1/2.  Oh well, i must support Niko because he doesn't really have anyone else.....except for maybe his fiancee.....who nobody, especially me, cares about.  Brittany - we need to sick the Canadian Mafia on her immediatley, lol!  Happy 4-day Hockey/Hangout Weekend!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~
