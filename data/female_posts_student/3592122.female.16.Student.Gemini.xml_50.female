You see the anger that burns from her gaze, The madness that sets her eyes ablaze, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the fear that closes her eyes, The smile she wears is but a disguise, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the hope that is finally dead, She cannot trust for her heart has been bled, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the love that lies within, But she shall never love again, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see death's hand that has glazed her eyes, No one saw her die inside, They won't cry. No, they won't cry.
