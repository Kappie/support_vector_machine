I'm waiting for my father to bring Chinese food from Chopsticks home for dinner, but we better eat pretty soon b/c  am getting quite hungry.  And my back is peeling from my really awful zebra stripe sunburn. Wonderful.  Yes!! Chinese food a.s.a.p.  We hear about the results for the elections tomorrow.  Wish me luck!  P.S. They are Kurt, Frederick, Liesl, Louisa, Marta, Gretl, and Brigitta.
