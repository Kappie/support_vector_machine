I jumped onto my dad's couch and flipped on my tv when I heard yelling outside. I walk over to see what's going down outside, and I happen to see a shirtless fat guy screaming at his poor wife. He was yelling at her because she never respected him, So I yell down and tell him to shut up, and his wife starts yelling at me for talking shit about him. I thought I was helping to, So I quickly shut the window.
