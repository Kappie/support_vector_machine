Do you really want the whole world to see everything? all the clothes are soooo sleazy! i mean you watch movies that are set in the past they dont dress like that they look beautiful in their nice long skirts and tops that dont have cleavage hangin out! our society is so trashy now adays. everybody is grundgee and skanky. i dont get it and what really gets me is that half the people that wear this stuff have fat rolls hangin all over the place! i mean come on gross but then what can we expect when over half theUS is overweight anyway? it just really doesnt make any sense. should we not leave alittle mystery about us or by the time people are married its not gonna be anything special well as it is its getting to where its just another fun activity anyway... and its even funnier that these people go to a church and call themselves christians and say they know what the bible says and what god wants for their life ! HA HA ha ha
