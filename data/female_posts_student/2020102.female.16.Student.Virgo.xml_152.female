Cause I’m afraid it’s rarely been used and I’ve been confused and hungry  I’ve been thinking about the way, you said things could be if I’d Drop my disguise, uncover my eyes and see you love  And fiercely clutching me is the life I’ve tried to flee But I’m still at home, I’m still alone Cause I’ve embraced myself Now fiercely after you, I’ll trembling ask of you Destroy all that I’ve held Till all I have to hold is you...  I took the rations of the surface, and I’m not satisfied Drag me deep enough to taste you I’m starving inside, I’m starving inside -Rations ~ You drew the lines of where the sea would meet the shore The sky would meet the floor Who can compare? You showed the sun just when to pass the time to night And when to come back bright Who can compare?  Needer of nothing and giver of all Every living thing survives  By the strength Your boundless love supplies Lord of power beyond compare The universe sits in Your hands And eternity is where you stand  You tell the rain clouds when to hold and when to bleed To satisfy our need Who can compare?  You made the countless stars and set them into place To fill the void of space Who can compare? -Who Can Compare ~   I know by the way that you watch me You’re wishing I’d been someone else But stuck here with me, you know we’ll never be Like the people on magazine shelves  And I don’t know where we forgot We’re all worth enough to be bought with a life  I still can’t believe that the same voice that spoke all the stars into space  Says it loves me, and it made me nothing less than what I’m meant to be. The things I’ve believed have been misconceived  By this heart that can’t understand love - Help me to see what you see in me  I’ve felt in your touch that you love me But I’m drowning in all the world’s lies The way that I see is untrue to me So this human heart’s asking for some inhuman eyes  I don’t know where, but we forgot We’re all worth enough to be bought with a life -Can't Believe
