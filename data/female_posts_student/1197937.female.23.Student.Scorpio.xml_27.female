Head there's a section on the LSAT called logical reasoning where a lot of the problems give you a conditional statement (if a, then b), and asks you to identify the opposite (if -b, then -a). the trick is to not fall for the false converse (if -a, then -b), or the false inverse (if b, then a) because they are not necessarily true. great stuff no? well ponder this: has it occurred to you that a lot of commercial advertising capitalizes on our misperception of the false inverse? car ads, for example, always show some scantily-clad lady sprawled on top of the car (the conditional statement: if there is an X car, there is a beautiful lady), making you think that if you buy the car, then you will get the lady (the false inverse: if you want the beautiful lady, you have to buy the X car). sneaky...a darn good thing that men aren't marketable, b/c women never ever fall for false advertising.   Drag-Free yesterday, i literally had to drag myself to the hair salon for a hair trim. must be part of the whole PRS: less haircuts, less facials, less primping in general...what a terrible trend. anyway, not having had time to make an appointment, i pulled a walk in and ended up waiting for forty minutes. that sucked. and then, I was introduced to the blurr of a man into whose hands I would be laying my hair destiny: blonde-streaked hair, eyeliner-mascara, tight baby-t, tighter low-rise black jeans, i'm talking the whole works and nine yards. my only instinct was to bolt and never look back, but instead, i froze like a deer and just followed this finger-snapping, hip-swaying Being to the Chair. "And how may I service you my love?" uhhhh...  to my amazement, within a matter of minutes, all my bigoted inhibitions went flying out the window. jay-c, as he preferred to be addressed, was attentive yet responsive, gentle but in command...basically, everything a woman could ever want. "How's this my love?...Did that hurt my love?...Is it too short my love?" to quote those herbal essences commercials, the experience was truly organic.  sitting in that red vinyl chair, with jay-c snipping away at my "tresses"and "locks," i found myself fantasizing about the great friendship that could develop between me and this flaming gay man. wih the volume of knowledge between the two of us on matters of makeup, dieting, and men (in that order of expertise), heck, we could probably take over the world.   okay, obviously, that didn't happen. but I did get a great haircut. so after twenty-two meandering years of salon-hopping, i finally have a hair stylist to call my own.   It's good, isn't it / grand, isn't it / great, isn't it / swell, isn't it / fun, isn't it / Nowadays  Man, this entry is like a friggin novel.  Oh yeah, if you read nothing else this year...  A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn. definitely not as bland as it sounds. quite timely too. here's an excerpt to whet your reading buds:  The treatment of heroes (Columbus) and their victims (the Arawaks) -- the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress -- is only one aspect of a certain approach to history, in which the past is told from the point of view of governments, conquerors, diplomats, leaders. It is as if they, like Columbus, deserve universal acceptance, as if they -- the Founding Fathers, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, the leading members of Congress, the famous Justices of the Supreme Court -- represent the nation as a whole. The pretense is that there really is such a thing as "the United States," subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels, but fundamentally a community of people with common interests. It is as if there really is a "national interest" represented in the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts, the development of capitalism, the culture of education and the mass media.  "History is the memory of states," wrote Henry Kissinger...  My viewpoint, in telling the history of the United States, is different: that we must not accept the memory of the states as our own. Nations are not communities and never have been. The history of any country, presented as history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploiting, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners.     running late!!! Lemme know what u think.
