"how much is it?"-guys "$2 a person, or $5 for a family."-man "oh frik."-everyone "i suggest you all get together right now and decide what your last name is gonna be."-man  ahaha it was so sweet. so mark paid...i think we're supposed to pay him back. (psht.)  then when we got to the carnival thingy, and sylvia and anna and her friend came. i got excited by the ferris wheel. it looked like so much fun. so i bought coupons...but no one else did. aha. then we walked all the way to the other side of the park, and went to the petting zoo. and saw llamas. everyone loved the llamas. then we walked to the lake/pong/thing and watched little kids playing in the dirty water...then ray threw a golf ball into this waterfall thing to watch it go down and into the lake/pond/thing. it was amusing.  then we started walking to get some food, but the guys got distracted by a tree, so they climbed it and us girls kindof watched. then we were gonna leave them, but they came down, and we again started walking to get some food. and then sofija and kate and brian and vanessa and robyn and i think that's it arrived. so the guys and them went to the petting zoo, and erblina, vanessa, sylvia, and i went to the hotdog stand.  while we were at the hotdog stand, we saw christian. so he talked to us, then he just left. without saying goodbye. thanks.  then after we ate, we walked again. then me and sylvia got in line for the ferris wheel, and vanessa and erblina walked around. me and sylvia were waiting in line for like...half an hour. it sucked. but then when we got on, i was like freaking out cuz i was so excited. (i hadn't been on one for like...ever.) it was so funny...cuz sylvia kept rocking the seat, and i thought i was gonna fall off. then we were looking for the guys (they were all wearing black t-shirts, so we thought it would be easy to find them), but when we got to the top there was like a sea of black-shirt-wearing people...so obviously we couldn't find them. then vanessa and erblina came and watched us on the ferris wheel, and they were like laughing at me. cuz i was laughing so hard...wow i'm such a loser.  so after the ferris wheel, we walked to try and find everyone. then we bumped into sofija, kate, etc, and we started walking to where sofija said the rest of the people were. but then we saw lisa and hannah, so we (i) stopped to talk to them. then we found the rest of the group, and sat down and talked and stuff, and i made mike go buy me some pizza. then erblina and vanessa left to find erin, then they came back (without erin), then they left again to find em and tim. but no such luck.  then they came back, and we all sat down together. and then we saw  morgan . it was my first time seeing her in like...3 years? yeah. it was so awesome... (she hasn't changed since grade 6. at all. it's sweet.)  then i took some pictures (some unsuspecting ones of mike, which are pretty funny), and then the fireworks started. i was like killing vanessa cuz i was lying on her... it was coo. then i realized that mike, evan, and that randy kid weren't with us anymore. and then we all saw mike running around, and apparently he was lost. i was laughing at him.  then the fireworks ended, and i walked with vanessa and erblina to meet vanessa's mom. then my cellphone wasn't working (to call my brother to pick me up), so i had to use vanessa's wayne's phone, and it took forever to arrange a pick-up place with my brother.  then i walked to true value hardware, and my brother drove me home. he was pissed off cuz he had to drive me, and he wanted to hang out with his friends more...i'm a bad sister.  and that was my night. it was so much fun... i wish canada day was EVERY DAY!  "i really like your shoes, kate."-randy "...thanks."-me "can i have them?"-randy "uh..no.."-me "no kate. i  really  like your shoes. CAN I HAVE THEM PLEASE."-randy  *as my mum dropped me off with all the guys...who were making noises and being "rebellious".* "...are you sure you're going to be ok with them?"-mum  "hey i love your LV purse!"-some girl talking to sylvia as we walked by. "...it's not real."-sofija "fine. don't fucking talk to me, bitch."-girl. ahaha  "i haven't had a hug from you for like...3 years!"-me "..oh, that's too bad."-morgan  *pulls out a flashlight that looks like a tampon.* "isn't this awesome?!"-sofija "what is that?!"-vanessa young "a flashlight!"-sofija "omg i thought it was a tampon!"-vanessa "yeah me too! hey, maybe it is. it's for those dark nights when you can't see anything. the light can help you in those situations."-brian  so anyways. that was my night! sweet, eh? woot.  so no plans for today... but 23 days till england. woot.  you always had the blondest hair.  kayte.
