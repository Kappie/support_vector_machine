Porque you are asking, well, it's because my parents don't return home from the trip until sunday and because marissa spends the night at dave's house (don't ask, i have no idea).  So yeah, I have returned and I'll write about my trip and read about your guys shennanigains in a bit but for now, since no one is home, i think i will run through the house naked...
