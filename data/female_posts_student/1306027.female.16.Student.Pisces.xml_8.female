I can't help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept my membership to the general public... and then I shudder. I like being me, most of the time anyway. But then again, who knows who I am? I dont' even know anymore. Maybe that's part of growing up. Or maybe the temperature of the room is affecting my higher thinking abilities. Either way, I feel like I'm missing something. I don't really connect with people, and when I do, it's only people who have equal or higher thinking capabilities. I mean, should I connect with some bimbo and start giggling in audaciously high tones to keep a certain status quo?  People don't understand me . I like being me. I want to be me. I don't have to go to a public school to become  somebody.  They think that I'm so anti-social and I'm not. I have personal preferences, just like they do. What's the frikin deal? Please, I want everyone just to grow up. Your friends don't make you . Just for once pretend that your life isn't about them. Don't ask for their opinion, don't take their advice.  Be yourself . But then again, who are you? If you've let your friends dictate your life this whole time, how are you supposed to find yourself? When it really comes down to the line, you'll find that your exactly the opposite of what you could be.  Some people say that your friends make you. That makes it sound like your so co-dependant, that you have to have friends that make who you are.  No.  No one makes anyone, it's all foma(lies). But there are on occasion, people who will affect your life, and for those people you can be truly grateful or ungrateful too. I do not understand what the problem is. Why? The eternal question of mine that will never be answered. Think what you will of me,  I dont care anyway . I have a life to live, and I intend on living it to my, yes my, fullest potential. Does this mean that I have no friends and I sit in my room all day? No, I have friends. I enjoy having friends. But my friends don't make me. Don't get me wrong,  I love my friends . Its the people who don't know me, and think that they do, that really set me off.  Sure, everyone has certain feelings about my homeschooling, but that doesnt mean they have to share them with me. When they ask if I want to go back, I always say no. Why dont I want to go back? For the same reasons that you stay.  Its John Galt syndrome  why give in when I have so much potential? Granted, I know that High School for alot of people is a "learning expierence" and they will never forget the memories from there. And I realize that alot of people can maintain an identity of sorts through High School. These people are inspiring. But just because I chose not to have to fight to keep that in a public school does not mean that I am a weird and anti-social person. I am doing this for  myself , no one else will benefit. Is that selfish? No. I am me and I fight for that which can't be seen.  Identity.    You might think that this blog entry was a total waste seeing as no one is likely to ever read it. But then again I'm not writing this so you can read it. I'm writing this to confirm in me what I have always feared.  Myself.
