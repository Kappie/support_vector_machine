We're getting down to the wire now, one more exam to go, and it's the mother of all exams.  It's a monster too!  Stupid contracts.  Nobody ever uses them anymore...they're sooo outdated.  Think I've got all the rules down pretty well, it's just that stupid application crap.  I really dig the professor; she's very much a sweet old lady who's a joy to talk to as a person, but she's been teaching this stuff for nearly 30 years and knows it like she knows breathing.  So she's setting the standard very high on the exam, which is a nice little challenge, but also a bit disconcerting when you've worked hard all semester, know pretty much what's going on, but  in your practice exam answer you only get to half of the concepts she gives in her Model Answer.  Don't think the day before this exam is going to be as relaxed as the other "days before" have been.  Had a pretty good study day today.  Changed my study-pals as the usual one's not quite at her peak.  We zoomed through our outlines, and by 130 they were all packing up.  Discussion of the rules we all know only gets you so far, after all, as previously explained.  So after a mid-afternoon break in Student Health with said usual study-pal, managed to work on a couple of practice questions.  Feeling pretty good about them overall, it's just that pesky extra one-half of material on the professor's answers that's bothering be just a titch.  But yoga's coming up here in about an hour, and we love that.  Going to go over more questions and answers tomorrow, too, so all should be well.  Yay.  The Property exam was entirely too easy, but I'm choosing to rejoice in that fact.  Our section was allowed to bring in any material we worked on (class notes, outlines, etc.) as well as our book, which was a bit helpful if for no other reason than to extinguish any excuses for not knowing the requirements for adverse possession.  Felt bad for the other section's students, though.  Here we were with all the material from the entire course spread out around each of our computers and their areas were just plain empty.  Poor suckers.  Have to laugh at the other university students talking about finals week.  Feels like we've had finals Month.  The last two weeks of test-taking have felt longer than the four months it took to learn the material.  Now that it's almost over, it feels a bit bizarre.  In 48 hours, none of us will even remember our names.  If I don't post much after tomorrow, it may well be that any memory of my blog's existence was wiped out Thursday night.    So I'm thinking about setting up a Web page so I can use the links on here.  Seeing as I'm a cheap whore who doesn't want to spend the $6 a month to have a Super Blog on which I can post pictures, I think I'll take advantage of my overpriced AOL internet connection and make a free Web site.  Yay!  Not that anyone would be interested in seeing anything I'd link to, but still.  Then I could say I have a Web page AND a Blog!  My god!  There'd be noooo stopping me then!  Hmmm....think I'll go investigate that very matter...
