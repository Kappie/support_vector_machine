I went to Smith today and it was so crazy to go back there and I can't even begin to explain the memories that came rushing back to me, just by walking those halls. I mean I cant wait to get out and move on with my life but then part of me just wants to go back and be that little naive 8th grader. I only have ONE more summer left until I'm done. I can't believe it!!!! I'm gunna bust my ass this year and just coast my way my senior year until graduation (hopefully) But I'm going to bizounce. Later dudes! ~*CaSeY*~
