(i like this intelligent talking im doing...must be the medicine..) i was out of gym and some nice jacobians let me play cards with them. fairly good way to spend gym might i add. math was stupid spanish was usual. that mostly when i read the talon. and now for the  Quote of the Day  "You are incapable of having a normal discussion because you are too wrapped up in yourselves." Mrs. Taylor to my fellow Spanish classmates. aint it the truth
