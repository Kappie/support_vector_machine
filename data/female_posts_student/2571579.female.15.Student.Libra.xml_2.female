I gave this kid Earl four quarters for his dollar so he could get a soda. He realized i still had his dollar and started freaking out. He was like attacking me haha. Then he started crying and ran between the baseball field fence the wall next to it. I told bobby and him and a few ppl were trying to convince him to get out. That didn't work very well and the kids started yelling that Earl was stuck. I jumped down to try and help him up to find out that he had plenty of room even the way he was sitting. However i didn't and couldnt change the way i was facing but that's ok. So the whole camp decided to flock over just as i get inbetween the fences or whatever. But he came out as soon as he realized he had everyone's attention so i slowly made my way out with him. A kid was leading him out with a ball of yarn like he was being pulled out of a mountain avalanche. Then they clapped when he got out. But that was my day.. i just cleaned up arts and crafts after that. When the day was over we went to Salerno's. That was a party as always. Bobby took one sip of his beer and we wernt sure if he was drunk from that moment or just acting like an idiot as he claimed. He was just ripping people apart and all they had to saw was bob your drunk and the whole table just died laughing. I had like 4 or 5 peices of pizza haha. He asked why i was so quiet and i said that i had nothing to say. Which wasnt true at all but i didn't want to get the jokes turned on me which could have happened easily. I know i need to say something about Al now.. i just dont know what. There are so many things i'm just not sure anymore. Matt was saying how he asked how far we got and that he called me prude cause we got next to no where. But matt knows other stuff but i dont know what really went on in that convo. Everyone left and we barely said goodbye so.. till next year i guess. That kinda sucks =\        After the party tho.. Erin, Christina, and Katie came over as our second year tradition. It was fun as always. The most eventful part was probally the drawing on me with permanent markers. They all signed their names on my legs and drew a few things here and there. It came off tho. Already actually which is interesting. Pen and stuff usually never stays on my body long. Like when i'm writing myself things to remember and then i cant read them. anyway...      Carissa called me twice to remind me that i was going to the pittston fair with her after i already knew that. However at 7:30 i called her and was planning on getting ready real quick and going but she was going to Matt's. Alrite no biggie. I chilled here with eileen and we watched Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights. Heath would be proud! I already miss her and Mand. But that was an amzing movie!!! I loved it soo much! It makes me want to move to Cuba and meet a hot guy and dance with him forever. ::sigh::       Eric Clapton- Tears in Heaven   "Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.
