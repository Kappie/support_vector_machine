You will be able to have 5 male heads turn and gaze at you in unison and utter a  synchronus "GOD DAMN!".  5. Wear anything that accentuates more than would a potatoe sack  4. Wear a Conversational T-Shirt (i.e. "I love jazz...., Where's Waldo?,Or "If you're close enough to read this shirt then you are close enough to suck my dick!")       I've found that you will be getting responses to whatever witty thing your t-shirt says from men and little      old ladies.   3. Make Eye Contact      In New York It's understood that this is either an open invitation for sex or worse yet a threat    2. Smile and look like you're having a nice day      Though it seems harmless enough and will elicit cool things I miss about small town living like being somewhere "Where everybody knows your name?" and eye contact? It also elicits responses from every preacher, talkative crazy homeless man etc ....  1. Do any of the above at night  Ok....So I'm ranting......I'll leave it at that
