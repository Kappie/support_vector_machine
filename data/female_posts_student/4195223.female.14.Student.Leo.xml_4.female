Since I had one of those normal days today, the kind where you just sit there and stare at the computer screen like it's going to do a trick, so I don't have much to write about. I asked Kelly "what should I write about, I'm stoopid and can't think!"  "Your friends, and how wonderful they are ;) "    As Corney as this sounds, I actually think I will, just to introduce ya'll to them.    Kaylee: We've been friends for 4 years. She's the girl that gets ALL the guys, and as you might guess, yes, her chesticals ((boobies)) are bigger than my head ;). Well, that, and she's nice, and purty, and outgoing. She knows Everything about me, and we've fought very few times in the last... Forever. Her mother however, is a prude. She hates me, and I can say the same as my feelings for her, she's thinks I'm some kind of whore ((how offending, eh?)) When I always thought I was a good kid compared to all those other hoebags. ;) Any ways, Kaylee's great, you get the picture.    Kelly: Kelly is... Well, Kelly is alot of things. heh. She's extreamly open, and not shy about herself at all ((well, i'm sure she is a little, but she doesn't appear to be to me)). We havent been friends for very long, two years or so maybe, but that's okay. We've NEVER fought that I can remember, because she normally takes my side ((but as we all know, I'm right all the time anyways ;) )). She really Likes the guys too, and from what I've noticed, the guys like her back. She's real into church, and that's awesome, because now I have a trustworthy referance. And we always have something to talk about. She's really supportive whenever I'm feeling... depressed, and that's alot of the time. So Kelly, I love you... ((hugs)) lol.    Kelsey: Kelsey and I have been friends for about, two years or so ((same as kelly)). She's definitely the HYPER one out of all of us. She's a rebal, and a christian. She has her bumpy times though, but it's always good when she's her hyper outgoing self. She's normally really sympathetic to my problems, and lot's of other people's too. Kelsey has more friends than anyone I've ever known. I can't even get along with a small group of people, let alone the whole 7th and 8th grade. But She's nice, and nice is good. ((moving on...;) ))    Chelsea: Chelsea and I have been friends for, guess? Two years or so, the same as Kelly and Kelsey. She will have fun no matter where she is, be it alone, or with a group of people. She laughs at everything, funny or not, and she's very care free. She, like Kelsey, Has WAY more friends than me, she's definitely a 'People person'. But, I love her anyways.    Jacob: I've Known Jacob since I was... In kindergarden. ((But obviously I know him a little more now ;) )) He's great! He's more of the guy that you couldn't picture in a relationship, and infact, I still can't But apparently it's possible. He seems kind of tough and stuff, and he is I guess, but it doesn't seem that way when your with him 'one on one'. Anyways, I love him, he's great ;) .    Kyle: I know, I know, ya'll might not think the highest of Kyle after my last post, but really he is a great guy. I've Known Kyle for about a year and a half. Kyle Lives in michigan, I live in Ohio... that kinda sucks. But, I Love Kyle like he was my brother ((infact, I have a brother named Kyle, really)) and he knows compleatly EVERYTHING there is to know about me, more than the people I know in person. He's really funny, and Definitely outgoing. He's not like anyone I know, Inside, and appearance wise. I love him, we're just not as close anymore ((as you may have noticed)) but I still love him.    Jami: Yes, I know, He has my name, but how cool is that? I haven't known him that long, But what I do know of him, I like. He's a big geak ;) and That's awesome, he's REALLY into RPG's and stuff, infact, I met him in an RPG chat room. He's really sweet, and a big flirt ((and I know he's reading this right now and blushing)) and he helps me out whenever I'm having problems.     Rachel: Heh, Rachel is my bodygaurd woman ;) but really, she is. I've known Rachel awhile, but never really talked to her or got along with her until this past school year. She's very awesome, her and Kelsey are best friends, or it appears that way. There's not much I can say about her though... she's just.... Rachel, and a very awesome Rachel at that, lol.     That's all I got for ya'll. Like I said, I don't have many friends, I'm not a people person ;). I guess this might come inhandy incase I mention someones name, now you have a little backround check on each of them. Well, cya for now.
