I mean, come on. Perk yourselves up, it's summer! There is absolutly  nothing  that I hate more than when peoples names on msn are ":'( I'm so sad." "Oh, I'm going to kill myself" and then you say "How are you? " or, "What's wrong?" and people respond with "I'm depressed, I'm sad. Blah-de-blah-blah" and then you say "Aww..what happened?" or "Why?" and they say "I don't want to talk about it." If you don't want to talk about it, keep it to yourself you stupid un-educated fools. If you have no intention on telling anyone about your problem, you obviously don't want/need help, therefore, putting it in your name is a pathetic cry for attention. And I'm sick of everyone saying "I'm going to kill myself because my girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with me." Killing yourself has to be the most selfish thing in the world. I mean, yes. Go, shoot yourself in the brain. Or even better, why don't you hang yourself in the bathroom? Yeah. That would be good. Becuase you know, your parents will find you, and just call the cleaning company and get your body removed, and all the blood scrubbed from the tile floor. Sorry, no. Cleaning companies don't do bodies, nor do they do blood. Your parents will be cleaning up your stupid dirty mistakes, all because you were too much of a dumbass to deal with them yourselves.    Wow..that's horrible. Forget everything I just said. I usually have so much..compassion. I just needed to get that out. But now I'm done. I love you all, you all mean so much to me. If you need to talk, if you're sad or depressed, TALK. Just dont say you're depressed and not talk. That really drives me closer.     Anyways, enough about this. Jonathong came back from England today. YAY FOR JONATHONG. You will now all notice a signifigant decrease in the amount that I talk to you.  With the exception of Curtis, (Of course, because he is GO[o]D[e][s][t].)      Tonight..I went swimming with Brandon, Stephy and Demetri. It was exciting..Stephy and I formulated a new plan..under the matress in the water. We also talked about Curtis. Swimming was good. I enjoyed it. A girl called us fat..or maybe she didn't call us fat, but she was talking with all her friends, and I heard the word fat. So I assumed it was about me. Because I always assume It's about me. You know..if I was like..400 Pounds. I wonder how I would survive? I also wonder how I'm going to survive when I'm actually in LOVE with a guy and he breaks up with me? Ha that should be great. But enough about that.    CURTIS, this paragraph is for you. Do you know why? Because you're the only person who ever reads my blogs AND I can hear you making sounds on microphone right now...sounds that make me smile. Curtis is my friend. Curtis your voice makes me happy. As do you. You're my friend Curtis. You also make my heart smile. I'm way too tired to be typing this. And I hope hope hope that you call me in the middle of the night..oh how I would adore that. But I know you won't, my friend Curtis. So I'm definitly not going to get over excited.  I definitly had to emphasize the 'friend' thing. Anyways. Yes...    That is all...Too tired to type more. Hope you enjoyed!
