Thursday I really realised how much he means to me, and how much we're really supposed to be together. He left on his cruise friday. He's going to be gone for 9 days. That doesn't seem like that long when you say it, but I hate having to spend even 1 day without him. It took us like 15 minutes to say goodbye thursday, not to mention I started to cry because I miss him so much. I'm soo pitiful. I hope we never breakup, and at this point in the relationship those chances are extremely slim to none. We've been together for about 10 and a half months. That's a record by far for me. This is going to be a REALLY long week, but at least Ashley is home so me and her can go do stuff....
