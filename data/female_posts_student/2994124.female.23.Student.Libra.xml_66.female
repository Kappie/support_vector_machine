Only have a few on their as it takes ages to upload them and can't do it on the uni computers as you have to download this package to let you do it, and you can't download stuff on the uni computers.  Have added them on the main template - but actually I might not be able to fit that many on that way, may be better to add them as posts like the one below. hmmmm.....
