He's so smart and funny.  I love Steve.  He's so smart and funny. I remember how I said on my Matchmaker.com profile that I would love to have lunch with Eddie or my father and how Steve wrote me back saying that he liked Eddie too and that he misses his mother and knows what that's all about.  That's how we started chatting and look at us now!  We're frickin' homeowners, for cryin' out loud!   Flashback: walking down broadway by 164th Street just coming from B's house.  I spot my father walking down the block too.  I yell, "Hi Daddy!"  "Hi muneca!" He says. Together, "what are you doing here?"  Then laughter.  He went to get some chicharron from some restaurant over there (I suspect there's a lady involved)  We chat, I point out that I now crave chicharron.  He hands me his bag and we walk a few blocks together.  Said he didn't really need it anyway.  Me and Ronnie had some yummy-ass chicharron that night.   I miss my dad.  I wish he were around to meet Steve.  They would have gotten along.  Luckily Steve's dad is a lot like the white version of my dad, so I have a reason to celebrate on Father's day after all.  I love Pop.  He's so funny.  Just like Steve.  YAWWWN.  I'm pretty tired.  I hate getting up early.  I hate having to bring the car into the shop.  Everyone is inconvenienced.  Damn I'm fat.  What should I wear today?  Maybe I'll put on my contacts... Ooh!  Bill Clinton is on the Today Show.  Cool.
