So on Friday I work 9-5 (KENDRA) if somebody (KENDRA) wants to come (KENDRA) and get and application (KENDRA) and have lunch w/me (KENDRA). Tomorrow @ 2:00 I have an appointment to get my hair cut, styled  highlighted. I think I am going to get light brown and red put in, but I am not positive. But it better turn out good, cuz it'll be costing me $90! Oh, and I'm not gonna wash my hair either b/c I can get it washed there, it's in the $90, and so yeah. I'm really excited. I wish I was going today. Roberta has an appointment @ 3:30 to get her hair cut. She told me that she wants to get just the TIPS of her hair dyed PINK. Crazy! I told her I wouldnt talk to her if she did. Plus my parents wouldnt let her.    Oh, Casandra doesn't live with us anymore, so Beth I'm not sure if Dan will work with her. She got kicked out of the house for lying to my parents and me (that's a no no), and seeing this PIECE OF F*CKING TRASH named Seth that my parents (AND I) did not like. But of course there is more to the story. But the bottom line is that she does not live here anymore. For the moment she is living with my grandma. So yeah. I'm mad @ her and don't care anymore. But I'm really tired now  my head hurts and I want my uncle to come over to get my cousin Derrek (he spent the night last night), and bring his boys!!! lol. See ya.
