Lucky for me I'm a slave to the man and in this wacky world of papertrails the only lighting is flourescent, so I've relocated the ecosphere to sit directly under my flourescent desk lamp.  Maybe I should put some of my SARS infested snot into the mix, to jumpstart the "growth" in there.  Nah, thats too gross, even for me.    Anywhoo, todays observations: still the slight greenish algae tinge on the bottom, condesation in the top of the bottle.  Nothing of notable difference.
