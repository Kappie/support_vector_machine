I'm thinkin' if I should put that  Old Mc Mark   video which I discovered just today, or the video of  Dr.  Mark , Teacher  Tom  and Patient  Travis  . Hm... Maybe I should put a  Sum 41  video, like  Still Waiting , perphaps?  Well, I'll decide later. For now, lyrics of  Look What Happened :   Look What Happened  by  Less Than Jake  And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try and we'll walk in circles around this whole block walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks and we'll talk about leaving town yeah we'll talk about leaving I swear it's the last time I swear it's my last try We rode across that bridge all night we talked our way through city lights traced all the lines we're killing time under those buzzing signs from downtown to anywhere but here tonight yeah I swear to these rooftops and just hoped that car would never stop we drove around this place all night past closed signs and familiar sights we're moving by passing time counting those center lines with 20,000 lines left to go that lead to somewhere I don't know it might be the time that we leave this all behind there's been a few times that we thought it felt right to take all the westbound signs and just leave town tonight   During the chorus, the guy singing it sounds so cute!!! Wonder if his looks fits his voice....[Pardon me for being so boy crazy, I love guys with great voices, like Mr.  Tom Delonge  for example.]  Oh, if you're wondering why there are horns played in the song, becuz this genre is ska + punk [=Skunk!].. and ska songs have horns played in the song.
