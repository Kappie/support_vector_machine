This is my handy dandy pixelized detention slip scrap paper journal in which I can entertain you with the 2-bit jokes from deep within the matrix of mind. This site is basically a comedy journal for me and my friend. People in the land of we-have-a-life fondly know us as Marissa and Candi... I mean Carissa and Mandi! Together... we will conquer.. and Become the president and Vice President of America!!! Er.. I mean we'll become friends of comedy who should get a job instead of sitting infront of my 1989 monitor thinking of witty things to make you people laugh. And looking at how stupid and utterly annoying the election of 2004 is looking it'd be best to pack-up, move to Canada, and get on your computer to laugh at the jokes here, because face it, you'll need the laughs, eh? Anyways, the kind of jokes me and oh great one will be posting here are things such as nutty pick-up lines, life's unanswered questions, bar-jokes, Questions of the Month, Why'd the chicken cross the road? Answers, Fake College/Highschool Exams, and the ever Popular things they should make into a bumper sticker. We won't have all of these categories up for a while, so please, bear with us! We actually do have a life, however tiny and goony it may be! We have things to do, like school! School's not important, but we either have to goto school now or face the fifth grade while we're playing bingo at the nursing home. And finally, without further Ado, I present to you... The Jokes and Gigs me and my friend are typing insanely to create! Laugh loads, have fun, and enjoy! Bon apetite!        -Notice-    We realize you probaly skipped a few thousand sentences. But even if you did.. READ THIS PUNK! Any copying of our jokes will result in a swift kick in your ass and the ridge marks of my boots in the turds you shit for the next 5 years. Thank you for your time!    -Barbara Streisland    (No, not really! It's me you idiot!)    _________________________________________________________________
