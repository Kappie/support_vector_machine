I swear to God though, an entire hour was just spent on that stupid bibliography. Ahh!! Craziness. I am going to be royally screwed in university. I don't think I like writing essays. Although it's pretty cool, seeing as I wrote it in under... 4 hours? That is plausible in university. So maybe I won't be royally screwed. Hmm... *looks pensive but is actually thinking about ice cream*   My printer is sadistic. In fact the entire computer upstairs is sadistic. It breaks constantly. And it freezes constantly. And it takes another fucking hour to print  after  hours of working!! I remember when I spent an hour working on something, and it took longer to print than it did to finish the stupid work... how is that efficient?? Madness, and I hate it. Stupid printer. It hates me.   N is turning 14 this weekend. She is such a young little kid! And she still looks older than me! And, I don't have a present for her ^^; Verver bad *g* I'll buy her a chocolate bar tomorrow or something... lol.   OMG! And T didn't tell Frodo that she liked him. Like wtf!! She promised me. And then he came late to school, so she didn't have the chance. And then she couldn't find me and everyone else at break to tell him, so she chickened out (dunno why -- it's not like we're actually gonna be there when she tells him, so I don't see why she needs us), and then after school T and I were running around like headless hens looking for him. And she had this totally perfect opportunity to tell him, and she didn't, the loser!! I am going to tell him that she likes him myself if she doesn't keep her promise, swear to God! On the good side though, Frodo's sibling (ahem *g*) knows now, so that's pretty cool. Proud of T for telling her that. Even if she did fall over... Murdles does that whenever someone cute walks by though, so it's all good.   The As are yelling at me to finish my entry, so I'll just leave now. Byee! And sorry it's not long ^^;
