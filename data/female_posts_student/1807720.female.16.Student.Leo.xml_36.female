I studied really hard for that and well that mark isn't like amazing but it is not really bad either and right now I am just aiming for over 70% cause that is what is reasonable for my abilities for chem.  My average when from a 67 to a 68.89 or something like that which means it will be rounded to 69.  I mean that mark still isn't too great but at least it went up.  Afterall I would much rather see my average go up then down anyday.  However, the math test is a different story.  I worked my ass off to understand that unit and I really did believe I understood it but some of the questions just stumped me and I didn't really know how to do em cause I got confused.  I really need to boost my math average cause it is at a 70 but with the next unit test mark going in I can only pray, and hope, and wish that maybe I did do good on that math test and I am just underestimating myself.  Afterall I have done the very best I can, and truly believe in my heart that I derserve over and 70% in math and in chem.  I have worked my ass off to understand the stuff to the best of my ability and I have practiced math over and over, I don't know anyone who practices their math as much as I do.  I seriously don't even know who goes to as many chem tutorials as I do or who even studies as much as I do for that stuff.  I deserve way over a 70% in both things and sometimes it kinda bothers me cause well I KNOW that I have done my best but sometimes I wish my "best" were better.  I want to make honours more than anything and if I don't yeah I think I probably will cry.  I deserve to be on at least honours - I deserve it.  I have worked so hard to this point and it would be disappointing to see all my efforts and hard work go to waste.  I guess I should stop worrying so much about it right now though cause interm/mid reports and TAPS are not till ike mid November I think and from now til then I am gonna have to keep working hard and putting in the effort.  And well in the morning I told my TA *ALL* about what I thought of the schedule and stuff and we were getting into like a little bit more detailed conversation than she asked me if I was eating properly.  And well like EXCUSE ME but like that is my business and stuff.  Besides I don't skip many meals during school anyways and really should should stay out of stuff like that.  Besides I have been eating junk lately cause I have been worried about Chem and Math.  Today at lunch I hate 2 of those mini-chocolate bars and then my mom bought me two cookies from Tim Hortons.  I don't want to gain weight I see all the others girls so thin, I want to be like them and look like them, and yeah don't get me wrong I would like to also wear a size 2 but well I would be happy with size 5 cause I have giant bones so I don't think size 2 is realistic.  And chels man I am getting sick of her.  I hate to say it but it is SOOOOO true.  She is becoming self-centered and like she is always like "Everyone always comes to ME, Me, Me" and "When they need to talk they come to me" and blah blah blah.  I can't take it anymore!!! ARGGGG!  I am sick of hearing her complain and work, and chem, and people, and all the other shit.  I mean I complain too but not nearly as much as her and she is always in a bad mood, I hate it!  Eric is starting to get fed up too.  We are all annoyed.  She was my best friend and on a certain level still is a "friend" but we are not friends like we used to be.  It is her who has changed, certainly NOT me!!!  Everyone has noticed it too, and it is not only me...it is EVERYONE!!!  I feel like I have grown up while she is still stuck in her whatever-you-want-to-call-it-but-it-seems-like-she-is-so-imature-and-annoying-and-whatever Land.  So yeah there are alot of things going on right now and yeah some good and some bad.  I suppose I am still pretty happy though cause well I raise my chem mark a bit, but still a little worried about math.  I suppose it isn't the end of the world.  I am happy and worried...I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing.  I should probably go eat my dinner now but I am not really too hungry but I want to eat anyways.
