I'm trying to stay off AIM, and invisibility's been middle ground but I still feel like half a cheater when I do it. I like to see the movements of people, though.  Tried playing Bach. There's something weird with my fingers. And I just got a jolt of adrenaline, I don't know why. Is it because of Bach on Saturday? NHS tonight?
