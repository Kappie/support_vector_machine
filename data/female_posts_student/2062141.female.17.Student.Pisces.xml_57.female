I miss summer... last summer was so great. This is the embodiment of feeling-good-rocking-out-windows-down-stereo-blastin-great-to-be-alive songs... if you haven't heard it try to find it. You HAVE to hear this one. It'd make me sad to listen to this now... caues it's not summer...not that I could listen to it... GIVE ME BACK MY CD, FRUIT PIE! ......love ya.... :D lol  All American Girl Train  To be that good, it must be taxin' No such thing as satisfaction You're makin' things happen while I'm relaxin' Like a Sunday afternoon My dad used to tell me I was lazy I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze  I'm the left over turkey for the world's mayonnaisey The star next to the moon   Now I know I'm just here to amuse you And I don't mean to abuse you But if I could just use you one time   Tell me what it's like To be the queen of it all The Neiman Marcus of the Mall And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I never had a supernatural feelin' Not to mention a sexual healin' But every now and then I get to the kneelin' To thank him for it all But you probably got some inside connection So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them So much muscle that you never gotta flex them To catch you when you fall   And I know I'm just here to amuse you And I don't mean to confuse you But if I could just use you one more time   Tell me what it's like to be the house on the hill The number one diet pill And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl
