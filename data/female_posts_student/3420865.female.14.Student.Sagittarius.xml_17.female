(my mum was working, my dad's in australia, and my brother has a social life.) i kept hearing voices/noises...erin says they were all in my head. great, so now i'm crazy. woot. oh, here is ray's way of comforting me:   Ray says:   what was that noise?  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   aha!  Ray says:   it came from upstairs  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   aha oh that would be the rapist hiding in your closet.  Ray says:   no i heard it come from your house  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   RAY SHUT UP!  Ray says:   uh oh  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   ray i'm gonna start crying.  Ray says:   i think he's coming down  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   SHUT UP!  Ray says:   dun dun  Ray says:   dun   aha he's cool though... even though i was scared and he was being a meany. oh, and right before he logged off, he said: "have fun. and look out behind you."  i bet you can imagine how comforted that made me feel! thanks bud.  so that was yesterday. today, i woke up at 12:30! it was crazy talk. so i went on msn till my brother woke up and kicked me off, then i worked on my collage again till like 3:30. then i had a bath, erin called, i invited her over... and now i'm waiting for her to get hurr. sweet.  well i'm outtie yo. paice playa.   these words they choke me-  they resonate in my heart.
