I'm back from Washington state.  It was a great visit, I found out a whole lot of family history, spent time with my (semi-estranged) brother and my (semi-estranged) son and his family.  Went well, mostly.  We all survived, at least.  Great to see my stepmom again, got a little hiking in - and LOTS of eating!  Heard an interview with the author of "The Gospel According to Tony Soprano", or something like that.  Talks about all the parallels to the book of Ecclesiastes, which is about a man who finds riches, wisdom, and pleasure - and is still unhappy.  I'll never view the Sopranos the same way.  Saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" last week.  What a blast!  Kim loved it too.  I tried to get her to see it when it came out, she hadn't heard of it, so wasn't interested (We saw "Undercover Brother" instead).  So Daf got a big "I told you so" score outta that one!
