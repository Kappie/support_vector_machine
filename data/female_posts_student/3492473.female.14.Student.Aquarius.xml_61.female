As I looked in the fridge, I saw we have this corn beef sandwich meat, so I took a piece. I was still chewing as I went into my brother's room to get headphones. Eddie was like, "What are you eating?"I just smiled and said, "Nothing."Eddie: "It betternot be my chicken nuggets!" I stick my tongue out so he can see it's not. "No, it's the roast beef stuff." At the time, I forgot it was corn beef. "See it's notwhite meat, it's RED meat!"Ya knowb/c the nuggets at Mickey D'sare made with all white meat. Well, after I said that I realized something. The corn beef was BEEF not RED MEAT! And I felt like the biggest idiot...oh well! That's me! Thenearlier I got this email with dirty and clean jokes. And this one is REALLY funny!        Dad has two!         One day, the teacher was teaching a health class on sex education. He pulled down a chart of the male anatomy and asked if anyone knows what this is? Little Johnny raised his hand excitedly and blurted proudly, "I don't know itsname but my dad has two of them." The professor said, "Johnny, you must be mistaken, your daddy doesn't have two." Johnny insisted, "Yes he does. He has a little one he uses to pee with, and a big one that mom uses to brush her teeth!"        check out  urlLink http://www.aarons-jokes.com/ for more jokes!
