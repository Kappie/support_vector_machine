I got in trouble 3 times in 2 minutes, I was blogging and I wasn't supposed too (?), I left the blow dryer down stairs, and something else that I don't remember now... :)  So, as a result I coudn't use the computer all day.  Yuck.   School was bad.  At lunch Zane and Ben got into a huge fight and Ben punched a hole in the wall and I was like right next to him so I had to talk to our principal about what happened and tell ehr what I saw. It was so stinkin' scary. I was like shaking.   Aaron joined the water bottle game yesterday!  He sat right next to me. That was *ahem* interesting.   If all those preppy girls want Aaron to look at them they should should start throwing water bottles at eachother, it works mighty fine!   Then I went to a going away party for me dear abby...:(  It was fun!  Then I went to church which was SUPER fun!  Then I went come and finished cleaning the house and studied for spanish.   Then this morning I woke up early cuz we had a field trip. We picked up Sara and went to school. Then we got on the bus and it started to snow. So we headed to portland and went to the art museum. When we were done they said we had to go back to school. It was SO sad because we were going ot go shopping but because of the snow we had to go home. Waaa   So we waited at school for 45 minutes then Sara's mom came and picked us up. Then I went home and played in the snow with my cute little neighbor and took pictures. :)  Now I am here.   All toasty warm.   And that my friend, is a quick overveiw the the last two days happenings.   Peace.  Laura
