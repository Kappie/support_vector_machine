I vow to:   - stay faithful to my blog.   - stay faithful to my journal and 'Zhou Ji'.   (Jesslyn's phrase)   - stay faithful to my idols.   - keep fit by playing badminton whenever I can.   - practise piano and guitar whenever I can.   - only use computer for 2 hours a day.   - only watch TV after everything is done.   - do my homework and revisions once I reach home(after bathe).   - show Chimp Lee my potential.   - not give my slaves their salaries.      "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." - Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948)
