I've been avoiding the overflowing laundry basket for the last month or so and am now paying for this; I have about seven loads to do and am still on the first one (the machine is inexplicably taking over 200 minutes to do a 90 minute cycle). At this rate I will be finished at......about lunchtime tomorrow. 2) set up my blog to do a little message at the end of each post with what music I'm currently listening to. With mp3s this is difficult. With ATRACs (which all my music files are, due to me having been stupid enough to download SonicStage on the basis that I could get a free song download with every Big Mac), it is apparently impossible. 3) add a thing to my blog that shows referrers. The preference of most bloggers for this kind of thing seems to be "TrueFresco", but the only one of theirs that will fit in my sidebar is the one which only tracks referrers over the last 24 hours. For a blog that gets anything between 3 and 5 hits a day, this seems somewhat pointless.  If anyone has any advice as to how I might be able to solve any of these problems then please do  email me . (Obviously I don't expect too many responses for the first of the three but any suggestions for the other two would be greatly appreciated.)
