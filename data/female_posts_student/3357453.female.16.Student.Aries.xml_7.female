"don't talk to me ever like that... its fucking rude.. I don't want to ever hear u talk abt money and my family like that...We earned it... ur family can too"  of couse we can. if we choose to make do with the "hack care attitude" but excuse me!! my family are thankful wit the amount of money earned by mum, dad, sis. happiness does not derive from money money n more money only. of course u can b happy with more money lah.. but there are many other more important factors to make ppl happy, u noe dat?? aargh.. 'happy only when i earn alot' --> my parents dun tink tis way. get dat? so there's no point telling me my family can b rich too.. of course we can, dat is if we wan to. but there's no point..
