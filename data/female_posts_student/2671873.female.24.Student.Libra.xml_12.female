Quite an experience, when as an American I check my email 100 times a day.  So here I am back on the Blog.  The time abroad was interesting to say the least.  I almost missed the bus, due to trying to get an hour of sleep before we left at 4am.  Then I had a little falling out with some of the girls in my class....well I should clarify....there was no falling out just a feeling of complete exile.  Mix that with a visit to WWI war memorials and grave sites, and a concentration camp visit and it provides a very emotionally stimulating week (or not).  Not to mention all that was mixed with Paddy's day and 8.5-11% alcohol level beer.  I didn't partake in the libations really for fear that I may emotionally lose it and if that were to happen no one around me would be there for the support I needed.  Now I am back in Derry (Praise God).  And I am working like none other to get my work done before Easter break and my family's visit mid April!  Other than that, no profound thoughts or perils of wisdom.  That will have to come after I write a shit-load of papers.
