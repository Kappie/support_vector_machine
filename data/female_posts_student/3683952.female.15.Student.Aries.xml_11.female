My heart yearns for you to understand, but language is just another mean of barrier between us. U said you know me well. But i'm no longer the young girl i was. I can and will change. I pray that one day u will see who i am inside. Turn back and look, I am no longer who i was. Let me fly. Its always you. You never fail to be the main source of my pain. how i wish things are not this way. i know that you don't mean it. I know you think that you are caring. but somehow i dun feel any consolation. the more you seem to try to understand the more you think of me the wrong way. Please. look at me. don't just see the surface. Look in deep. i am no longer what i was. look at me please. I really pray that the next time i feel hurt, the source is not you but myself. because i don't want to hate you. I rather hate myself. Let me learn. Let me fly. At least i know that if i fall, the next time i'll finally be able to stand by myself. Please look at who i really am and please listen to what i say before you dismiss all my thoughts that you never tried to understand. Please turn and look at me and remember me. Remember my face, know that i've change. I'm so afraid that you will forget the new me and always remember the old past. Daddy Mummy, please look at me. Let me fly. Please.  - *with his love* -
