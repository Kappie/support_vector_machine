Ever since I discovered the horrible truth - that I would one day have to grow up, I made it my duty to defy the laws of the universe. I swore I would never grow up, I'd be the one sliding down the stairs on my butt, riding the carousel 20 times, and farting in the bath tub just to see the bubbles. The most horrible thing in the history of ever, happened to me when I was about eleven.   HoRmOnEs.   I found that I could no longer run quite as fast seeing as I was being weighed down by these strange grape-fruit sized growths protruding out of my chest and that boys were no longer differed by the fact that thier hair was shorter than girls. Then when you really sit down to think about the pros and cons you really begin to realize that having a kid at 17 is utter hell and that the ideal age to get married is about ,say, 25-28. So why in gods name was the horror of mood swings,cramps, and bizarre fantasies bestowed upon the young? Bleh, does the universe hate me?   However despite the stupidity of teenager hood that tries to eat away at the child in me I still manage to retain my 5 yr. old mentality.  Proof of that consists in the fact that i would much rather watch Matt and Garurumon kick the stuffing out of some 50 foot bear on Digimon than watch the many love crisises of FRIENDS. Also considering I set the alarm clock for 7o'clock on a Sunday and spent the entire morning watching a Digimon marathon.Ohh yeah, cause Kouji is just too hot to miss.  I also made a discovery today, thongs are fun.  No really, Their like these giant sling shots you can shoot at people. See you can't do that with panties because there's just to much fabric, and boxers are way to big. As you've probably guessed this idea was thought up while sitting on the can and starring down at the clothing around my feet. I continued pondering the idea...I don't remember a lot of it but I think it consisted of giant armies with crossbow thongs witch cause serious whiplash...though I don't think you really want to know about that. Ahem, then somehow  I began wondering about the power of spandex and why so many super heroes enjoy modeling the material...but that's a whole other page all together....
