I called you today after another argument with Ismael. I did ask him today if I needed to call you and ask you what my job duties were and he told me I didnt need to call you, that our center ran differently than yours and that we could work this out ourselves. I guess our main problem is when he tries to get me to do things that are unprofessional or things that I view as responsibilities that someone with more eduacation should be given. I am a smart person, true enough, but I dont feel that it is professional to ask someone to do things they dont know how to do- especially when it involves someone else who has asked for their help.   I started working here May 10, 2004, and my official title is a Computer Lab Aide and it is a workstudy job. I dont remember exactly what my duties list, but when I came here for my interview he did say that some of my job duties would be helping keeping the building clean, answering phones, helping people with minor computer problems, and helping monitor the activities that go on here. I did not sign up for what I've had to deal with the last three months. I kind of thought that I might have a little bit of a problem when he tried to get me to forge someone's signature on a thank-you letter he created for the Cinco De Mayo event that they had shortly before I came here. Most everything he has asked me to do I haven't had a problem doing, but I feel like I'm being taken for granted now and it's becoming extremely obvious to not only myself, but the people that frequent the technology center. I didnt mind opening and closing when he was ill, but there has been way too many times  when I have absolutely no warning if he is or isnt coming in, if he's leaving early, or if he's going to be late. I've had to open without warning, close without warning, and pretty much be here so that the center is open when he's not here. Myself and the other student worker, Toni have wet up our schedules so that one of us is here pretty much at all times incase Ismael is not here. I didnt mind being made responsible for the Newsletter, but at a meeting he told myself and Toni that there are grants that the center has recieved that have not had their requirements fufilled and told us that it was up to us to teach the various classes. A couple of those are the Web TV class and the Palm Pilot classes. I happen to be a part of this community and I've volunteered at the Eastside Community Center for six years, so when I told the former director about the classes he offered his time, free of charge, to teach the Web TV classes. When I went to Ismael about it, he told me no, and that  he wanted myself or Toni to teach those classes. Since I've never used Web TV, and I am a full time student with another place of employment, I thought it was pretty unfair to be expected to teach classes on top of what I already do here. I'm responsible for the newsletter, everytime somebody comes in for any of the programs or resources we have here, he directs them to me, whether I know what i"m doing or not. If I tell him I dont know how to do something, he expects me to just "figure it out" on my own without any help because he's busy. I've gone to ask him for help several times and found him looking up how much it's going to cost him to take his family on vacation or how much it's going to cost for him to take his masters degree program, and while I know I dont work as hard as I probably should, when something needs to be done, I've done it up until the last couple weeks. He takes on extra projects and hands them right over to me usually, like the certificates for the Financial  Literacy courses, the ad the American G.I. Forum purchased for the booklet for their convention, and some menus for a restaurant someone asked him to make. Several times we have bumped heads because he wants me to cut corners or be unprofessional in the things that I do. When we do argue, he asks me if I like my job, or tells me that maybe I shouldnt work here. I'm sorry, but I'm a part of this community and I do what I can to bring people into the center, but when the things people come here for arent even here, why would they come back? He tells people about the classes and never schedules them or expects us to teach them, so they just never get done. We have the key train software on all our computers now, but I dont know how to use it or anything, nor did he try to take the time out to show any of us how to do it, so if someone came in and asked about it, I wouldnt know what to say. If they did come in and ask about it, he would refer them to me, and because I think it's  unprofessional for me to try to teach someone something as I'm learning it, he gets offended. I'm not really good at resumes and someone came in asking for help on theirs today- this has to be the 3rd or 4th time he's done this- and he referred them to me. I told him I'm not really good at them, and he says, "well if you would take the time out to learn right now, it's really easy." Well, I feel since that person asked for his help, he should be the one helping them. A lot of people ask him tohelp them because they're not comfortable with a young person helping them and he always sends them my way. Very rarely does he come out of his office to help someone with something out front. I think that if someone comes in asking for help, someone qualified should be helping them, not a student who may or may not know what they are doing. I have some computer knowledge, but I feel that if I needed some help, I would want someone that knew exactly what they were doing as to not make any  mistakes. I dont think I would want someone teaching me something as they are learning it because it's a waste of my time. I'm sure most people feel the same way. Today, that was what the argument was. I told him that maybe I should call you and ask what my job description entailed, he told me no, asked me if I like my job, told me I wasnt a team player,and told me maybe I shouldnt be working here. This is always the way arguments go with him. Maybe he thinks he can threaten my job or something to keep me in line, but I dont do anything unprofessional when it comes to the work I turn out. And if he wants me to do that, we will argue everytime- and I"ve told him this on more than one occaision. There has been many times when I've wanted to call or e-mail someone in charge and let them know what's going on, but I was trying to keep a good relationship with my boss, but he has made it clear that if I dont do everything he asks me to do, he pretty much will do the same thing he  does everytime we dont see eye to eye. He will ask me if I like my job, tell me maybe I shouldnt work here, and hopefully I will say that I dont want to work here. The problem is, I love my job. I've actually taken the time out to get to know most of the kids that are here on a regular basis,I'd like to be involved in this center because I live right in the neighborhood, and I'm even here more than 25 hours usually because if I didnt stay some days, we'd close early. Too many times we've opened late or closed early because Ismael isnt here. I'm afraid that if I stay, we will continue to fight about petty things and then when I want to implement tutoring or mentorship programs here on my off time I wont be allowed to because he doesnt like that I argue with him. I dont want to outright call him lazy, but when the kids around here know that if I wasnt here to open, we wouldnt be open, I dont know what else to say. I'm sorry if this creates a problem, but I've held my tongue a  little too long I think. Thank you for your time and consideration of my problems.
