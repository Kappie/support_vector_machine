So, I started studying again. Biology is rough, very rough.  Thank god for the notecard, mine will be freaking full!  That bizatch will help pass me! Another thing!  I just saw this huge-ass spider crawl on my wall as I was watching the Osbournes!  SO BIG!  I killed it, I was so pissed!  HOW THE FUCK DOES A SPIDER THAT BIG GET INTO MY HOUSE!  I don't care what the answer is Jason, it is a rhetorical question so don't answer... Back to the old drawing board so I'll see you all tomorrow!  Screw school and beware the spoon!
