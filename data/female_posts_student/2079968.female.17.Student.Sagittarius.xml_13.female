Nobody to talk to...bleh...i may either go for a walk, eat pop-tarts, work on this page, or watch tv...i dunno...  i'm such an insomniac...it isn't healthy. at all.  know what the bad thing is? nobody even  reads  this thing! it's like i'm talkin' to my self...  on second thought...do i  want  people to read this stuff?
