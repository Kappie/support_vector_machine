(wow... Where did that come from?) today I took one of my students to see the new Harry potter movie... I highly suggest those who have not seen it, should! It's a fun, fantasy movie that young and old can enjoy... Together even! Then, after the wonderful movie, I went to our church picnic (what was Rising Sun Christian Church is now Rockingham Christian Church). Words cannot express how blessed I am to have a church family like Rockingham. The people are so friendly, loving and fun to be around. There are times when I really don't know what I'm doing here in New England. I love this area, and I love my church family, but at times... I don't know if this is where God has me for the rest of my life. I wish that would be the case, but I have to be honest with myself. I think God will be changing my plans sooner than I think.... Maybe not for another year or so, but I don't know. I just get that feeling that God is working in ways I cannot imagine, and that is going to lead me down a road less traveled. although I love it here in new England, and would prefer to stay here for the rest of my life... God has been working. I can't explain what I really mean by thing, but it's something I know. The only unusual thing about it, is that when I've felt this before, I knew where God was taking me... That was New England! I don't know... Maybe I'm just getting antsy because I don't know what God has in store for me after school... My hope and prayer would be to work in Boston in a medical office where I can make the biggest impact. Boston is a city I love, and a place I can see myself in for a long time to come. But one of life's greatest questions for a Christian has always been "okay Lord... What are You going to have me do next?" For me... That question is what I'm posing to Him a lot lately. I just hope my prayers coincide with what the Lord wants me to do.... He is good, He is faithful, and He will never let me down! Love you all!
