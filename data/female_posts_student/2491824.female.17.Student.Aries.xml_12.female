I love the simple things in life.  ....At night, when I think back on what happened that day, I don't remember the supposedly "big" things, (i.e.- what I scored on a major test, what kind of trouble I got into (with parents, family, school, etc.) or any of that crap). What I think about and what I focus on are the little things. Such as: some random person saying hi and smiling at me, some minor complement from someone that i did not know (or not very well), helping someone (yay! i love doing that!), or just hearing a damn good song... .......I heard such an awesome song today... It's "The Future Freaks Me Out", and it's by the Motion City soundtrack. I had it stuck in my head all day... It's good stuff...  Here are my favorite lyrics from the song, tehe...   I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move Check it out I'm rocking steady To the beat in my head It goes 'oh, oh, oh, oh'   Hehe. That is so me... I'm always just off in my own little world dancing away to some song I made up in my head....   Good stuff...  ...I love the little things...
