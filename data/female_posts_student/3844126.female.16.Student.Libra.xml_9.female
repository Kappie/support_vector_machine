Mrs. Are was absent s0 we had t0 d0 this insane seatw0rk 0n a 1 wh0le sheet 0f paper, and it was really l0ng. g0t sick 0f reading the name BASILIO..but i kn0w it d0esn't end there. he's g0nna be ar0und f0r the wh0le b0ok unf0rtunately. [just in case y0u're w0ndering: BASILIO's what i used t0 call s0me0ne wh0 i sh0uld n0t name ever again. 0r else my dad'll have my head]  recess time j0y and i spent laughing at each 0ther as we ate a b0x 0f harry p0tter BERTIE BOTT'S EVERY FLAVORED BEANS. hmm..the grass flav0red 0ne REALLY tasted like grass. during physics, we did s0mething s0mewhat like an amazing race. my gr0up actually was supp0sed t0 be the first t0 finish. we just missed 0ut 0n s0mething. PE was spent swimming breaststr0ke. g0t a n0ice 10 0ut 0f 10 in the practical test. lunch time, mars [david's girlfriend] and kat "my lavs" ate in my classr0om. by my seat, actually. mars spent alm0st the wh0le lunch time checking if i was eating my f0od. [been having eating pr0blems lately. david instructed her t0 make sure i ate]. funny piece 0f bitter reality: i was the 0nly 0ne in 0ur lunchgr0up t0day wh0 didn't have a b0yfriend, n0r a l0velife at the least. OH WELL!! A sucked. sir d0n [the teacher wh0 c0ncentrates m0re 0n keeping his w0rds fl0wery instead 0f us actually learning] gave this irritating graded recitati0n in which he just HAD t0 c0ntradict everything we said. [damn c0in-jiggling teachers!] math time, i didn't listen. cricket and i spent m0st 0f the peri0d thinking 0f what i c0uld give my bestbud martin f0r his birthday. we were unsuccessful, by the way. and alas, english. sir omer [the brand-new-gay-physics-teacher] 0bserved 0ur class. haha. wasn't much.  basically that was my day. 0hyeah. i suck. i l0st keziah's swim cap [which i b0rr0wed earlier f0r PE]. s0 i'm g0nna have t0 buy her a new 0ne--which c0sts like, P400. sho0t.
