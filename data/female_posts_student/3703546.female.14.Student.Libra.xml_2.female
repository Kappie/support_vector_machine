Christians, who truly believe that they are going to heaven, are ready to die. that's why you see them so calm. because their religion has eased the thought of what comes after death, instead of this uncertainty that most, in my opinion, people have that causes such severe amounts of stress. i think that that's probably one of the reasons that religions were created, to make the idea of dying, a lot easier to cope with. i mean where would we be and what kind of society would we live in w/ out religions to control mass amounts of people. don't get my wrong, im not saying that religions are fake little leashes that keep people under control. but that's just one of the things i wonder about.
