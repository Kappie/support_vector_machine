Alyssa, Christian and I were playing cards and i got tired and borad of doing that, so i said i'm done, and came in and started talking to Rick on the computer. My sister and Alyssa came in and said that we can all play Truth and dare. I said no, i hate that game. After i said that about 5 different times, my sister starting going on about how i never play with them, and i'm always on the computer. (Which upseted me, cause it was half way true, but also the fact that i just got  done playing cards with them for an hour)So i truned off the computer and said, with a big hint of angry "Fine, lets go play your stupid ass game"........ I went into the living room and sat there for about 15 min.s by myself, trying not to this how stupid i just was. Alyssa later came out and just sat there. I went into T and Is' room and said our we going to play or not. And all she said was i didn't have to cuss. And she was right. I didn't have to be angry with her. I didnt have to yell at her. So i said sorry. but i knew, that wouldn't make a difference. Sadly we all came out into the living room, and said nothing. so i got up and said well this is a weaste of time. My sister and i later forgot about it. But Alyssa stayed out in the living room talking about her home life. Tina came out and sat down with me. We were both able to love each other. Alyssa went on saying how great Tina and i have our relationship. All i could was laugh. Seeing how i jsut yelled at her and cussed the first time in a year. And i felt horrible. That isn't something a women after Gods heart does. So why did i do it? I wish i knew. I was just angry. Said. I feel like i have to yell to get my point arcoss, no matter who it is with. Why is that? Something i need to work on. thats for sure...
