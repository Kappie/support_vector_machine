Just think, if I had chosen a different seat on the bus last night, today might have just been another day. A day just like yesterday, or the day before. Oh God, yesterday, I almost completely forgot. I broke down infront of the central administration building, after falling down the basement steps and realizing I didn't have rehersal. And that face. The expression on his face, or maybe the complete lack of expression, as he handed me back my things. It scared me so bad. I was there for an hour, until alex came out and sat with me, and my parents finally came and picked me up. I cried again when I told mom what happened. I almost cried again when I got to band and saw him, pretending he didn't see me. But as those buses pulled to a stop at the game, I saw him on the bus next to mine. And I know he saw me, because I think he smiled. Just a little. One of those small, uncomfortable smiles you give people when you think they're mad at you. But he still saw me. Then, as we got back in the buses to leave again, I saw sharon in the seat behind him, and we started up a conversation. She and Dylan asked me if I loved them, and I said yes. Then sharon asked me if I loved him, and I drew little periods in a row on my window and looked away. But when I looked again, he was looking right at me. He pointed at himself, and then rubbed his chest. He later told me that that meant "I apologize"  I cried a different kind of tear that night. I never realized how soft his sweatshirt is, as I gave him a hug and told him how scared I had been that I had really lost him, and he told me he was sorry. I didn't have to say anything. He told me he had been stubborn, and he didn't have the right to do what he did. My face burried in his shoulder, my arms around him, with his around me. And he told me he was sorry. And I am one million times better.  Good rides home are the best.
