It seems as though the meaning to life has just suddenly dissipated, a wisp of fine thread in my fingers.     There used to be so much meaning and purpose in my life. I used to love it. I used to enjoy school, make a difference there, make a difference in my home, and there I say even the world? Now that I think about it, what was it all for? Can anyone really make a difference? It's hard. It's just so hard.   But why am I complaining, right? I guess that on the outside I look...innocent enough. That maybe my life seems complete, but it's not...it's just so vacant...people may say that's easily filled up with studies, family, friends, religion even...but I just don't know...I'm beating myself up senseless over this...   What's the purpose, really...if you know, please tell me.  Amelia
