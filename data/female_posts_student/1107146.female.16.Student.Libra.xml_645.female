(Will never ever say that I actually listen to you for once.) BUT...and yes there is a but, I still don't think that Abby likes me. I would love for your girlfriend to like all of the group but apparently it isn't going to happen. I hate the feeling of a subgroup in a group. Oh yes...and tell her the comment on sounding like Scott was really offensive...REALLY.   Linds, I understand your devotion to Abby and I'm happy that she responds in the same. Sorry about Michael.  Will, don't you ever quote me on this: thanks for the good advice...I think you were the only one speaking without blatant anger, thank you. Your post calmed me down to NOT make an angry post. No I'm not going to listen to you more =P.  Zabeth...don't know where you are.  All: Sorry guys for going off the deep end. You've all known how I hate it when people hate me. Yes I know Abby doesn't hate me ... I knew that when I posted last but I also know that she doesn't particularily like me and I would like for that to change but it doesn't really matter since I never see her. Anyway have fun all. And Linds, you know how you  said you blamed it on Scott....don't...blame it on my insanity oh yes...and I do realize that he's jealous therefore josh, I don't like him. I can't stand people that say one thing and act out another. Sorry guys...Josh I dub you with the right to bring me down to earth if I ever completely go crazy again.  Oh yes, Abby seemed nice Friday. Needless to say, I didn't see the posts until today. Also guys what happened at DI.
