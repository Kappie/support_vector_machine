We had gone through so many rehersals specially just for this big day and this day was over now. Our triumphs earned our seniors' praises. None of them had expected us to play this well with so much confidence. Confidence is what we need. It was the first national day parade I attended at school...everybody is going to watch the process... Early in the morning, call somebody to headed to school. Shiting had specially arranged the score! [Thanks! I'm grateful! =)] She's so nice. So I went through the scores, practising the fingerings. Then fall in and say byebye to leonard and yuhui. Pammy specially came to give us the support. We fall in and it took a rather long time for the adminstrations to run up and down to search for the teachers-in-charge for the band room key! When we finally fall out, all of us were running upstairs frantically, and quickly set up the instruments and stands, take the score and everything else. So down we went with one trip, everything was set. The school was noisy with chatterings of excitement. I could hardly breathe. A lot of seniors came down to watch and helped us out in the tasks such as arranging the chairs and tuning. I had never seen so many of them coming back just to give the support. Even Kaingee was giving a cheerful smile and her scoldings were forgotten. 2/5 were there and jiayi pulled a face. Everyone was cheerful. I really wonder will everything go this well. We tuned and then quickly went back to the seats. I looked around the clarinet section with a pang of guilt. Two juniors had wanted to quit band. They're only sec1 and even though I admit I'll love to had regina to quit band, I just can't let them off just like that. Band is about devoting yourself to music. I really can't imagine the trend going on forever like this. The parade began and I put my mind off those juniors. Summerset march was wonderful, everyone was on task. Followed by 'We are Singapore' which was constantly driven on by the trumpets which were sort of giving encouragement and support. Then Allied Honour as the NCCs march in and it sounded just like usual except from the fact that it was a lot more louder and it sounded a lot more stronger than ever. Next was 'Made in Singapore', some clapped along and we earned cheers. Then General salute and fanfare, they were OK. Fanfare bar 17 to er...where ar? Euphoniums sounded so much better than usual. We all cut at the specified time, it's so much better than during the rehersals. Majulah Singapura was played with the most confidence ever. I gave a sigh of relief. It was partially over, now we wait for the speeches to be over and play the final march 'One people, one nation, one Singapore' and it was all over. It's just one more step. We could barely smile during the song of 'My people, my home'. The section was so rigid and we were worried about the result of this parade. We sway to the melody, our faces solem. When it was the speech, the three of them [Jaslyn, Shiting and Erica] were giggling with laughter! What are they thinking!? seeing their faces made me so much want to laugh too but I quickly looked away to retain my laughter. No way. It's a parade. But the giggling continued all the way until the [old clucky hen]'s speech and Elaine were staring at us so strictly. I could barely contain my laughter anymore but it was over. Our serious faces appeared once more as we played the final song. It was so long, my eyes were concentrated on the piece, it was good and better [except I forgot to repeat in the final time]. Peggy instructed us to go back to band room and over there, Joel told us to keep our instrument. It were only the clarinets... It was over. It was all over. It was the best performance I ever attended of hopes and dreams. Smiles and cheers, busy chattering about the performance were common after the dismissal. It was a good day and the seniors were proud of our achievements.  The best performance ever of hopes and dreams....
