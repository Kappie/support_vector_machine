All this stress lately is driving me crazy.  In other news, is it stupid for me to be developing (or rekindling) a crush on MP?  We hooked up a few nights ago, and I have actually been looking forward to it since I got here.  I have been thinking of him.  It's pathetic, I know, but I guess boys at home are just the excitement I need.  Anyways, I'm too physically exhausted to analyze this.  Good night.
