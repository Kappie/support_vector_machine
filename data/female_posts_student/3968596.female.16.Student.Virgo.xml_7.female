It's makes feel all guilty....just because I don't practice for hours or as much as she'd like me too. Actually, it's more like I forget too...I honestly do! But I can learn pieces pretty quick though. Well I have till 3:45 when the lesson starts. I have a piece down for my recital down---"The Bohemian Dance" by something or other. It's quite nice. Have I mentioned that the recital's in  November ??  Earlier, Ryan lost his piano books---the same one one that coincidently have the duet pages in 'em. Well...yeah I kind of need those. Thank god, we found the music books! He says doesn't like piano or doing duets. I don't really care. He's a living hypocrit and pessimist, who tries to make everyone around him miserable. His lessons take longer b/c his teacher makes him stay in to practice more I guess.  Because Ryan hardly EVER practices. He's irritated that most of his lesson is devoted to learning the duet part instead of his book---well, if he  did  practice his lessons maybe they would move on to something else. Well my brother's a dumbass but that's common knowledge. He once pursuaded my mom to buy a huge pack of STYROFOAM plates because he thought they were better than paper. Yeah....styrofoam is deadly for the ozone layer. I had refused to use those plates and my mom purchase paper ones afterwards. She has even told me once that she would have gladly given him up for adoption if she'd known about the way he was going to turn out. He seriously needs a psychiatrist for a reality check.  Maybe some retilin too. -_-  ::sigh:: The piano beckons me. I must answer it. Or watch as my mother's money goes down the drain.
