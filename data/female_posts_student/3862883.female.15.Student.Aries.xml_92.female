But the child has to die happy in order for the father to be satisfied. Then the woman suddenly stated, "then...is your son really dead?" She made everyone think about that statement. This made the old man realize that his son is gone and is never going to come home. The kid is dead and the man weeps then realized that he is really gone. Those weeps soon turned into sobs which saddened everyone in the room.
