His mobster boss asks Gigli to kidnap the younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor, to save him from going to jail. (Ehâ€¦Right.) The brother has "certain physiological defects" and is in mental hospital. But Gigli just walks in there, picks him up and walks straight out again. (Wow.) Back at his apartment, Ricky (Jennifer Lopez) knocks on the door...She has been hired to oversee the operation, as Gigli's boss doesn't trust him to do the job properly. Gigli is a little offended about this:  "If you want to talk about reputations and it by some fxxxing miracle long shot you haven't heard of my reputation, let me tell you who the fxxx I am. I am the fxxxing Satan of Slick, Sadie. I am the Rule of fxxxing Cool. You wanna be a gangster? You wanna be a thug? You sit at my fxxxing feet. Gather the pearls that emanate forth from me. Because I'm the fxxxing original, straight-first-foremost-pimp-mack fxxxing hustler, original gangster's gangster!"  Pheeeew. And that's just the beginning. The film's dialogue is so long and unnatural, and it made me feel more and more embarrassed. Not too mention when they start talking about why Ricky is a lesbian. They are discussing the pros and cons of female and male anatomy while she is doing yoga on the floor!! It's NOT very sexy at all. And then...they fall in love. But wasn't she a lesbian? Not after a night with Gigli of course. The most embarrassing scene of all is when Jennifer spreads her legs and goes: "Gobble, Gobble- it's turkey time!" Watch it, and cringe!    Why did you agree to do this movie Jen?    I did it cause you were in it...Oh shut up! I don't want to marry you anyway!
