I've already made a "wish list", it is now time to plan a party..  I'm not exactly sure who or how many people I'm going to invite yet because I don't know what I want to do.  This has always been a problem.  I can never decide on what I want to do.  I can invite lots of people over if I am going to have a party at my house but house parties usually suck or something bad happens (ie someone gets hurt, pissed off ect.).  If I want to go somewhere, I can't invite tons of people because going on outings for birthday parties gets expensive.  I must think of something to do..  If I were to go on an outing for my party, I could go bowling (we'd prolly go to the zone), go see a movie (only 2-3 people would be able to go to that tho..), go to a restaurant (Nah. People suck. They'd expect me to pay for them), go swimming, go lazer tagging (?) or go gocarting (?).  I doubt that I'll be able to do the last two ideas because it's expensive$.    Once I find out what I'm going to do, I'll be able to make a guest list and plan everything out.  In the mean time, I'm going to call around and find out how much everything costs.  I know for sure that Kevan and Robin will be invited.    Any suggestions?
