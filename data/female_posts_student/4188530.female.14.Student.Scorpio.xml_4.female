Anyways today was cool I mean yeah I was tired as hell but I had band like all day and I LOVE band. Well I'm not a geek just that I know practically everyone so I can be more open I suppose. Nothing much had really happened unless you think me falling down during practice this band cause I was trying to dodge people who didn't give me enough room and yeah made a fool out of myself. I don't care I've already done that too many times already. Ok I'm watching the Olympics right now and it's awesome I saw United States and Japan back to back so I liked that. However when someone is holding the flag or someone really famous they show their name and what sport they're in for. Some are simple you know like swimming, basketball, track and field, and I think tennis. I'm like cool then there come some of the most riducous sports I ever hear of. I mean shooting and sailing??? Aren't those suppose to be hobbies? I mean come on. So if I go sailing I'm athlete. I might as well make up a sport that requires for you to run into the doors million of times. I think I might win the gold medal. Although I have to admire that they worked so hard to get where they are and now they're in a place that has been taking place for millions of years. In addition, it's a GREAT honor to be there... I'll probably won't ever be there unless I was selling hot dogs or something. Another thing I noticed. We have some interesting country names. I have typed enough so good night.
