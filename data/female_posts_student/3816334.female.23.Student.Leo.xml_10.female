As you may have already read my boss tried to pull a fast one and use parts of a project I was working on to create something "more exciting"  TO BAD HE GOT RIPPED APART by the dude the project is for. He should have stuck with what i wanted and had in the first place and it would have saved him ALOT of embarassment getting shot down by Yarnall!  The moral of this story is ... if i did it ... i did it right so leave it the fuck alone KEN!
