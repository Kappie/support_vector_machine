I could dig that.   I get lots of spam about enlarging my penis naturally.  Hate to tell them that they're wasting their clicks on me since I'm missing that vital piece of equipment nor do I have anyone in my life whose penis I wish to see enlarged.  Most of the men I know are already dickheads (hee).  Today I noticed that 16 of the messages so far, the ones that keep getting past my spam guard (which I guess doesn't work too well since I get 313 spams a day!) are for Vicodin.  Or, the way the spammers send it, V*  IC~ O     D *I~N.   I guess if I feel like becoming a drug addict, which is increasingly appealing as a reality antidote, I know where to turn...  More to come...
