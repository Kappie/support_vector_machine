Every customer is from other countries. He/She just visits here for a trip.  Anyway, We never charge any tax and everybody can buy something very fresh things. Therefore, every canadian visit on Friday and Saturday for buying food. Specially, On Saturday, many people come here early time like a shopping with family. Everybody has a smile on his/her face. It is good to watch them for me because I usually get tired from my work. However, If I saw someone's face which has a big smile, It would make me feel better and be happy even my work was hard.  That's why I keep doing this job even though the job is hard. Anyway, I worked so hard today and I could not take a rest even lunch time, too. To stand one place for 6 hours is so difficult to anybody. For me, Definitely hard..  My work was finished at 6:00pm and then I went to the Second Cup to meet Jay. She was waiting for me. I got some fruit and vegitables from my work for free. We just got home around 2 hours ago. My roommate already took a shower and She is watching my blog right now. Now, my turn.. I have to take a shower and go to bed earlier than yesterday. Tomorrow, I should go to my work at 7:00am so, I have to wake up at least 5:00am.
