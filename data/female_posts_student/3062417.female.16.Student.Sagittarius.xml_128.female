I got a 59 on my Math 40 week! I suck so bad. That's ok though because a lot of people did worse than me so I don't feel as bad. Plus she's going to curve them a lot I think. And when I got home I found out that everyone is going to Mike's at 5. So I'm going over there now. This should be a lot of fun.  Tomorrow is the Math regents. I'm going to fail. And then Wenesday is the Chemistry regents and Laura's b-day party.
