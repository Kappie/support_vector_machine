Yesterday as I left class to get my kids my car gets this rumbley in its tumbley.... yes I do love pooh and probably watch too much! So I head for farm a fleet. They are kind enuf to let me know that not only do I need new breaks, but that I also nee a new sway (stabalizer) bar! I am thinking 'oh shit' about this time. Well I guess it is driveable until the part comes in because it is a dealer only purchase... yippie! Of course I cal mom for the credit card because it is going to cost nearly $500.00 to correct! Ok well the damage is actually less than I was expecting so I am not in a total freak out... how ever it has pretty much determined that I will be moving again so that I can pay my mom back for it in the fall unless some miracle job pops up. LOL! I am so looking forward to finishing school next July so I can get a job and afford to be human again! Not rich, but dammit.... human at least. So there is this lab job I really want... not my first choice, but I would learn some phlebotomy skills and be doing lab work..... only weird thing about it... wel sperm washing is not on the top of my list for fun.... LOL!!!!! It is in an area I am working towards so it will do ... so lets hope it comes thru for me. I am really tired lately and have decided that tests in the morning are a bad idea for me. I took my c 6-7 quiz and got a D! F***! Not too happy about that one. This weekend will be a major study weekend and probably little or no internet and phone stuff for me because I also have a major practical coming up next week too. I must say that I dont think practicals are very practical. hehe. Ok so I am a dork... best known now because its sooooo true. My bf is planning to come down and see me for a bit on Saturday which will be really nice as  this has been a cruddy week now, and I  really need a hug! Specifically from him. I really like him being around. We have nice conversations and quiet time, watch movies together, play with my kids... and even tho he doesnt care for most seafood he will eat shrimp! YEAH! I am a major seafood fan... btw.. swordfish is excellent even if you dont like fish - very meaty and doesnt taste fishy at all! Lucas is very considerate and makes me feel beautiful, occasionally makes me laugh and has so many great qualities that are important in a man... some girl will be very lucky one day.... that bitch! LMAO! My pal Lizzie didnt come see me at school today! Sure she skipped class ( with a decent reason), but she didnt think I was important enuf to drive to school still and hang out with... LOL! Just kidding. I can be a real smart ass. Thats the thing about online... you cant see an expression or hear a tone of voice.. so its very hard to get what someone is saying at times, unless they are just one hell of a writer! I of course am not, but so be it. thi is still an excellent outlet for me and a great sounding board for thoughts that are making me bonkers... which is generally all the time! HA! This afternoon I have to call and check on a few apps to see if I am even being considered..... hell maybe I will live in a hut and do the 18th century thing... seems to be the big thing. Ok No way I could do that. Its not the work thats a problem because I hate to just sit, as I will most assuredly fall asleep, but it is the lack of a bathroom and bath! Gotta have em! I dont think killing my own food would go to well either... just the killing part. I mean I have helped skin a deer and prepare the meat, but killing......gbleaqigblerkbv!!!!! There really is no expression to explain it! I think I would have to go with road kill or become a vegan. See why I need this diary thing... I have all sorts of stupid shit rattling around in my head ... and this is all day most everyday. Tho I do understand now hwen men say they are thinking of nothing... it is probably the total truth... cause it has happened and honestly, its kind of nice! Bet it would be great to be a guy on occassion however I really do enjoy being a female... lots of things about being a guy would suck too. That is one I could go on forever about! Women have some things so much better, but then men have other things so much better. To be honest in the end I think it equals out. Now that would piss off the womens movewment and lesbians! Sorry gals, but I have right to my opinion! That is what they stood for isnt it? LOL! Everything can be a doub;e edged sword and its all about perspective. Anyway... I gotta hit class finally! glad I had a way to waste some time tho. Later!
