But what if i throw up? And I'll probably forget the whole thing.  She checks her clock. 5-30.  Arrrgh!! Still another 2 hours before I have to leave! What am i supposed to do?!  she thinks. While she argues with herself, Harold, the old weirdo (rather pervy too) is watching her rather amusing facial expressions through his telescope.  Only eighteen,  he thinks,  and so beautiful.  Anyway, Janey was getting bored, sweaty and frustrated.  What am i doing here?! Why did I get ready so early?!
