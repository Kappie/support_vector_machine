But Toshi didn't bring his cell phone with him, Masa and Tomoya went fishing first. After Toshi came back from macho club, we went to looking for them. It didn't take long to find them. They told us that they caught 5 fish already, but they sent them back to the sea. We changed to another place to fishing, but none of us caught anything. It was a relaxing time, a relaxing afternoon. 昨天下午和三个朋友去钓鱼，我对钓鱼是没有什么兴趣的，只是为了打发时间而已。记得小时候会和爸爸妈妈去什么钓鱼村之类的，大人在一边钓鱼，一边吃这瓜果，一边闲聊。而我一般则是被乡土气息所吸引，在一边和泥鳅蚂蚁玩，然后就等待那一顿下馆子的饭。昨天的钓鱼没有什么乡土气息，泥鳅蚂蚁，也没有下馆子。只是很普普通通的走到海边，然后开始钓鱼。海边钓鱼的人挺多，可掉到鱼的人却很少。主要还是感觉那个气氛罢了，海风吹在身上很冷，即使是在六月底的下午，依然需要穿件外套。最终，因为受不了刺骨的海风，想过夏天生活的我们就放弃了。 urlLink    fishing urlLink
