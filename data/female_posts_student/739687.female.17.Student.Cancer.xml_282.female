The way things are being left open and so unclear. There's not alot of clarity in my life right now, and all of a sudden I have to get up and leave it on hold for two weeks. The sad thing is that I don't think things will sit around and wait for me while I'm gone.  But I guess I need to be positive. I need to think that two weeks away may clear things up. That way, when I get back, whether things are the way I want or not, at least they won't have me spinning in circles. And a vacation is always nice.  Well, I need to do some packing and perhaps some other things as well.  Well, if I don't get around to posting again...I'll see you crazies in two weeks!
