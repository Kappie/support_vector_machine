(not to sound like a nut case or anything. you know what i mean.)   news here in boremont... there is none. imagine that! worked last night. i was supposed to work 2-6 but our water got cut off and i had to go pay the bill. and then they wouldnt have turned the water back on in time for me to shower and get ready for work, so i had tara go in for me. i was pissed that i couldnt work. but THEN, on my way home from paying the bill, lauren called and gave me her 6-10 shift. yay. im still not getting more than 4 hours a week, but at least im working some.   school in 2 weeks and 3 days. what a disturbing realization. someone should be shot.     "hand in mine, into your icy blues, and then i'd say to you 'we could take to the highway.'  with this trunk of ammuntion too, i'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets.  ...and i would drive onto the end with you."  - MCR
