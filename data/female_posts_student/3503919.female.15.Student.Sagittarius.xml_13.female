Although got some unhappy incident that let make me down but in at least I know wad is happening ..   First day of camp I reached school at 8.44am, at first meet Peiyu and Wanpin at the bus stop outside the school but they went in first.. So mi and KaiXin Went in to the library .. Saw Peiyu, WanPin, Shiqi and Meijun in the Computer Room .. Then we joined in ...Not long after we were being called to assemble and we were being divided into groups of 3. My group had around 15 ppl and our leader is Shiqi while asst. leader is KaiXin. We had to create a group name and group cheer. Our group name is Fruit Salad. After that, we went to the Reading Corner to pack the books... At 11.30am, mi, WanPin, Shiqi and Meijun went off for Physics remedial ... After remedial, we went to had our lunch. OMG, they bought Nasi Lemak but got a lot of chilli sia .. I dun eat chilli. Wanpin know that I dun eat chilli and she changed her white rice with mi and she eat those with chilli one.  (Thanks A lot WanPin ...)   After that we went to help KaiXin and Peiyu in packing up the water bomb. Very fun too. I also dunno why. LolX ! We went back to library to change and then went back to canteen and waiting for the games to start.  (Oh yah also Thanks to Amy for her slippers... Cause I forgot to bring mine...Blehx)  Then games started then kinda long story but not interesting so I am not gonna say about the details ..We went to bathe after games.. As for dinner, we eat Chicken rice ... Then we had treasure hunt. Our team won ...Ahems.. Then bring them to night walk and try to hide and scare them .. After that went to watch movie, The Haunted Mansion. Watch before liaoz but that was really a nice show. Then went back to library and going to lights off for the campers. Then we were in the room and wait or play comp cause there will be a patrolling later. I was in a group with KaiXin, Jeanette, Samual. At 1.30am, we went out to petrol.. But together with wanpin, peiyu, Jiahui and another guy name Kelvin. When we wanted to start at the running track, took a look at the gate and around. Wanpin said this was boring but as we had to report to Annie where we were, then JiaHui or Kelvin report back, "A car just pass by" then wee all laugh ... lolx..Not long after we walk away from the gate, a guy came and stood outside the school gate .. kinda weird and went to ask him wad is he doing there.. He look like a Ah-Beng to mi and then he say "This is my area" then I think, Ah-beng got in charge of school one mehz ...??? lolX .. Then he continued, he is Inspector ... ! LolX, a police ... Cause neighborhoods ppl called the police cause so late still got ppl in school.. Lolx .. Then we follow walking and patrolling .. Nothing found .. And went back to changed another group patrolling. It was Shiqi's group up next and so they went to petrol and TKB was with them while WanPin stayed in the library. Not long after, they reported back that there was a light in Computer Lab 6. OMG, mi, KaiXin, Annie and WanPin ran down.. We asked them to come back to the foyer... Then they ran back and TKB reaction was so funny ... Cause he nv wear specs so he cannot see properly.. Then he just saw some light and then he said " I saw light, white colour one, I also scared mahz, so they run lohz..." I heard and saw his actions... I keep laughing.. Really funny...We went back to library and then play comp .. Everyone was like damm energetic no one sleep. Until 3 plus, Shiqi and got ppl started to fell asleep. I wanted to sleep too, but the floor was too hard.. And I stayed awake and Meijun too... Until 5am everyone started to sleep and then we switched off the light and went out of tt room. I went out and feeling very cold ...   Second Day of camp At around 6.10am, mi and Meijun went to wake the campers up... At around 9 to 10 plus, I play comp and then fell asleep at the table ... At around 11 or 12 plus I wake up, but still feeling tired and TKB went in and and asked them out to do the noticeboard. Wanpin wanted to wake mi up but TKB stopped her but at that time I was already awake but still lying on the table.. Lolx .. All because of him lahz ...At first I can sleep at 8 but then gonna take care of the library then I sacrificed my sleeping lolX ... Nothing was done much on the second day and not interesting ...  That is how my camp was, although quite boring but still enjoy the time together with my friends....  [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-1234 Hrs
