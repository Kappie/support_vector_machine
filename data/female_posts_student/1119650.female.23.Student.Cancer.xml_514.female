Snow that was piled at least six inches high.  There is a step up to get in my front door which is completely covered and now the snow is piling up the door:    Just so you guys can really get an idea of how nuts it is this is where my mother and I were standing earlier.  You could clearly see where the driveway was and snowlevels there, but now, its just as high if not higher.  Rar!    It does look pretty, and serene, but I'm *SO* not looking forward to dealing with it tomorrow...
