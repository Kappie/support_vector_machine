Every inch of her bedroom door is caked in Buffy and Angel stickers. Not to mention her book collection- lining her shelves along with a few framed James pictures- nothing signed but then again he charges!! I think I should find a new obsession- but most of the guys I pick have played Vampires (i.e. Brad Pitt when he played Lious in Anne Rice's "Interview with The Vampire")...
