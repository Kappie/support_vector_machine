This was her diary.  And it's exciting and eerie all at once.  I've always been interested in Anne Frank - I found out she shared my birthday (June 12th) and was born in 1929 (I was born in 1989). Exactly 60 years after she was born, I was born. She kept a diary, like I do. These are her hobbies and interests: 1) writing, but that hardly counts as a hobby 2) family trees.... 3) history 4) Greek and Roman mythology Film stars. Family photos. Books and reading. History of art, poets, painters, music. Hate algebra and geometry.   She writes that after she becomes a journalist, she wants to be a great writer and publish books... and she says having a husband and children isn't too important to her...   But it's not only the fact that I love and hate every one of those things she mentioned. I felt as I was reading it, like I knew her. I knew Anne Frank. It's like she had touched a part of my soul and brought it down to paper - and I read her words and I knew. I knew exactly what she was going through and how she felt about her mother... I knew the way they didn't get along... it's like that with me. And I know how she was with her father - I'm very much the same - and I hate the way my mother and sister gang up on me and laugh at me when I'm in a problem... and I know what it's like to need somebody to talk to and to listen and to understand me...   I know what it's like to feel that nobody understands - and then finding someone who does. I know how it is to love somebody very much but know you'd never marry them... and how it is when you're a teenager and you have all these THOUGHTS and philosophies and you think about life! And you need to tell about it all and THINK and you grasp so much - and the adults don't understand that part of you.  And when you have two sides. The side that no one ever sees of you, the tender side that says it can love - and the other side, the front that one puts up to prevent ever, ever getting hurt.   Needing something to believe in.  I feel it all - and they killed her. They ripped, cut, sliced her life short where she was - what she could have been - what I might be someday. She was my age. And she's gone... and it feels like somebody hurt me too. I can feel that cut on my soul where she was part of me...  And yet I think she still lives on. I think... all I have to do is remember who she was and keep her very close to me, and just try and BE somebody. Be somebody... because she was somebody... and she could have been more...
