(sylvia=awesome.)  aaah after the milkshakes, came the BEST part of my life! (apart from my run-in with scott fischer.) we caught tadpoles! yes. actually, vanessa caught them and me and sylvia watched...we named the smaller one ethuce and the bigger one brucel. (ethel and bruce combined...cuz those names rock times 2.) it was kind of fun.  so we walked back from zehr's, and went to sylvia's house where we ate chips/read magazines/went on her roof/went on msn/straightened our hair/went on her webcam with ray and evan a... ahaha they think i'm ugly.. it was pretty awesome... and then we went to vanessa's house (we left the tadpoles there, in case you were wondering what happened to them), and then sylvia went to the mall with steph. she left us... and we cried.   but then we met up with em at st. francis, talked for a bit there, then walked through the woods behind taylor evans (got bitten to f-cking death by mosquitos, and saw a dead squirrel), and we ran into mark, mike g, nick anapolsky, ben matsimoto and some other guys i don't know, and we chilled at the park and at st. francis and stuff... and then emily left us. *tear*.  when we were at the park, the guys started to get bored, so they said they were going to get pizza... and they walked a couple metres away, and stopped and just started talking and stuff. and me and vanessa were kind of confused as to what they were doing... but yeah, then we decided to leave too. and then mike came running after us and walked with us. then we got to st. francis and we started sliding down the banisters at the front of the school, and kind of had races on them. it was fun... and apparently i don't know how to do it? eff you mike. i  so  do.  yeah after that, ben came to the school... and we star-gazed. and tried to figure out which one was the big dipper, and which one was the little dipper.  "which one's the big dipper?"-me "...the big one...?-vanessa  *after seeing mike lying on his back with his hands crossed on his chest.* "you look like you're in a sarcophagus."-me "hey, isn't that the thing in your throat?"-vanessa  "i think ben likes kate!"-nick "no! she's ugly."-ben (thanks buddy.)  *as mark was talking with a lisp.* "you're not gonna be able to stop talking like that."-me "yeth i will! oh frik."-mark  *after sylvia answered the door.* "hi!"-sylvia "hi"-me "...awww you're so cute!!!"-sylvia  aha ok those are all the quotes that i can remember/that are funny.  aaand i'm spent. aaah i've done NO homework today. wow. and i'm not going to do any, either! muahahahaha...ha...  you've got the map- come get to me.  these knuckles break, before they bleed.  kayte.
