Dan got a stunning 18 points on his first word, which, interestingly enough, was  orgasm.   He just kept racking up the points from there, while I was stuck with the crappy letters and practically setting him up for good spots (e.g., double/triple word scores) because I had no choice (really!) 
  Final scores:  Dan: 109 vs. Roz: 52 (boooo!)
