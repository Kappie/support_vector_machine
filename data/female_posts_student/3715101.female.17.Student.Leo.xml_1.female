     
      This is how you have left me. I have no reason anymore, No reason to remove myself From this darkened pit.  You had chances, and many, But I just don't have the patience To sit, sit and wait for nothing, Nothing at all.  Contrary to belief, I am not happy, Nor am I lament with greif. Beneath such facades I feel... Like an emotionless void.
