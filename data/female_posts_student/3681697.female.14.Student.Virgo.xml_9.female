C-C-C-Cinnamon lips and candy kisses, on my tongue. Fun!  B-B-B-Buttery eyes, if only cries could come from those eyes. Oh!  Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know?  I'm tired of looking up into those starry eyes.  Does it rain where you are? Does it snow?  And, if so, remind me not to go there, the weather affects my knee.    I've never felt this way before.    C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips, go powder your cheeks and meet your new beau, oh...  C-C-C-Counting sheep, if only sheep could put me to sleep, oh...    I've never felt this way before.   Some day (one day) you'll miss me.  Mundane Sundays, when I'm gone.  One day (some day) you'll miss me.  One day when I'm gone (adieu and so long) One day when I'm gone!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.   Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know? I've never felt this way before.
