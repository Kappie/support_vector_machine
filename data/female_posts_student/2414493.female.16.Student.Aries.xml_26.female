I am thankful for the people I see only rarely, who have yet to come to the point where they need to judge me. I am thankful for the pain of hard work and the belief that something good is to come out of all of this. I am thankful for those splotches of color in my life, the people who don't find it necessary to bring up whatever yuckiness I have in me, who just make me feel like I am a normal worthy human being.
