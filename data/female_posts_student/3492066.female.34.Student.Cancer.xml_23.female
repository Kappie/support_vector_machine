As her big sister, I guess I will be playing the role of big-sister for the rest of my life, of which I have no complaint. I don't need to loom over her, I'm just there to help her out when she needs it.  Then there's her husbad.  Aside from two small children with a third on the way, her husband is one of the biggest reasons she needs all the help she can get...mainly around hte house.  "I'll mow the lawn," he says, only to put it off for weeks at a time. And as for taking out the garbage, he'll get around to it...when he remembers.  So, to make a long story short, at the moment I am taking a brief break to grumble about my brother-in-law being lazy while I help my sister out.  As I was telling my mother, it's difficult enough to unpack a house after moving. Ratchet that up a bit with two little ones under five, while very pregnant, and with a husband who doesn't do much save take up space when he comes home from work.  I will say that my brother-in-law can be a good guy, but he just acts like he's trying to remain a kid, taken care of by his parents, and now his wife, and with little responsability save to go to work and bring home money.  *sigh*  He can't even clean up after himself it seems...cook, yes, and very well at that, but clean? No.  Good men are hard to find, and the one's who actually take responsibility around the house are even rarer. It's getting to be that the requisite for a marriagable man isn't how he looks, or if he's good in bed, but if he does dishes, the laundry, mows and paints.  Here's hoping there are good men in the world, because even my significant other is barely a good man along those perameters.  Back to work!
