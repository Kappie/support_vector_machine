I hit Dominion for some cereal and salad (I promise not to eat them at the same time), and then bolted down to the Faculty where I exchanged one book for five.  Seems like a fair trade to me.  Next I waited for 20 minutes at the ASSU only to be told that my particular course doesn't release their previous exams so I'm out of luck.  That really sucks; I rely quite heavily on those things for studying.  It's muggy here today with only a slight breeze to make it any better.  Drops of rain fall down sporadically, making the use of an umbrella not quite essential but not quite unnecessary.  Now home and cooled down, it's time to start reading for my psych course before I have to go to get a signature on my disability documentation.  It never stops.  More to come...
