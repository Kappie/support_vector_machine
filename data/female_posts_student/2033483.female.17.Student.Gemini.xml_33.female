I'm getting this sick feeling that winter formal is going to be a repeat of the last two years.  No date, no go, and no dress.    2.  Chocolate should be it's own food group.  Yes, Jessica, I too think it should have it's own pyramid.  Theirs Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, White Chocolate, chocolate with nuts, chocolate covered fruit.  Although, I do believe that chocolate and veggies are a no no.  Mostly because I don't believe that something I hate can go with something I love.    3. Christmas is the most wonderfullest holiday ever.  Why does it only have to come once a year?  Yes, yes I know the religious aspect of it, but still.    4. I love the 80's is Emmy worthy program.  If you have not watched an episode you are missing out!  5. I'm not really sure who all reads this because it is on the internet.  But I'm thinking it is around 2 people.  So to those who are reading this...I don't know wether to thank you or wonder if you have enough to do?  6. Why is it that when you need something dressy to wear to an event you never have anything and when you do have something to wear you have nothing to wear it to?  7.  Renae, this one stems from your "I'm never getting married" thing.  Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get married.  I look at all the divorced people I know and wonder if someday I'll be like them. God forbid, that's the last thing I want, but I wonder if you can love someone the same or even more than the day you said "I do."  I look at my grandparents who've been married for 53 years and think "do you still love him/her the same or more than you did the day of your wedding?"  Or my parents who've been married for 18 years.  I can only pray to have that kind of marriage when I'm older.  Maybe it's because I've never been in love that I'm so critical of the whole thing.    8. Tidbit # 7 really dug deep in my head.  9.  I think that guy from American Idol (I've never actually watched that show, tho)  Clay whatshisbutt is gay.    10.  People who mix math with science are sneaky.  They said Physics was a science class but I think I'm doing more math in there then I am in my Algebra 2 class!  Goodnight and God bless!
