I went to TechTruck to look at laptops, then I went to Blockbuster to return some movies and get some more, and before I left, I put Hyg端y, in his fish bowl, out on the patio to get some sunlight. I had him up on a little table-thing on the grill. It would be an almost three-foot drop, which for him is rather long. Well, when I returned home, I came up the sidewalk in our backyard, stopped on the patio to check on Hyg端y, and found that he was on the ground, under his fish bowl.   When I placed the genius-survivor-crab back in his bowl, I found a most  genius  setup, very impressive, for a hermit crab. You see, when I said good-bye to him, only an hour or so before, he was climbing on one of the two sponges that he sometimes drinks from. He slipped off, and I found that funny. Both sponges were in the center of the bowl, on a small hill in the sand that was made when he dug a hole by the side to lie in.   The setup that Hyg端y had "innocently" created was this:  The two sponges were up against one side of the bowl, and a shell that was a spare (incase he needed to switch shells) was in the area that he dug out. He also has a little drinking bowl, besides the sponges, and it was on its side, the water poured out, and it was up against the side of the bowl, along with the shell. This setup I found was a sign that a stroke of genius resides in my crab. He is truly Hyg端y... the Smartest Hermit Crab Ever!!!
