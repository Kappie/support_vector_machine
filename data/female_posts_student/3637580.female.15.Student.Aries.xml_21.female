I ended up going to the doctor because my ankle had really been bothering me, and then I came to find out that I ripped a tendon. So from Saturday on I rested it and it only seems to be getting worse...ugh what the fuck. I take my stupid medicine and I rest and stand around practice looking like an idiot cause I can't do shit and it dosen't even help, so today I decided even though it still hurt pretty damn bad i'd just stick it out, so I went and during the warm up lap it felt like it was snapping in two, i decided to sit out for the scrimmage. The coach told me and Alyssa (Thompson..who is also injured, same ankle same type of thing as i am..aww me and my big sister are injured together how cute haha...) to pump soccer balls and then just juggle around , kick the ball against the wall (wall ball) a little bit of that stuff, so we did and Mandy got really mad that we were "playing" and not out on the field, she said if you guys are messing around then you can run with us, so alyssa, shannon, and myself (who are all ...as the coach puts it..walking injured..jogged ladders while everyone else sprinted. ) whatever if it dosent get better I have to go back to the fucking doctor...ohh yeah the coach announced teams today...i'm on JV..but the coach said i'll most likley swing, which means I'll play both JV and varsity , which I am totally fine with.  I'm freezing cold right now, my house is like a freaking igloo. I should probally put a sweatshirt on...anyway  I talked to Madeline the other day, I haven't talked to her in a couple weeks or so. We haven't hung out in god-knows-how long, and I'm begining to think that our friendship is slipping. I hate to even think that, cause for the last 4 years or so we've been the best of friends, we've been through alot of shit, and I really do love that girl to death, I hope we can become as close as we were before. Sometimes I just feel slightly replaced by her new friends from Adams. And I wonder if she ever feels that way with the new friends I've made. I don't know but I hope things work themselves out. Once again I'm rambling...  So my dad informed me we will be taking a "little" trip this weekend, yeah we're driving to Canada to see my dying grandfather i've only met once...! GOOD OLD FAMILY VACATION ..it'll be just swelll. OR NOT. 8 hours in the car there, 8 more hours back. i'll miss the jamboree (which isn't even a big deal but still..) it's so annoying. i told my dad we are AT least going shopping once, cause if i'm in the car that long, i want the trip to count for something. OMG I really am a major bitch, my grandpa is dying, the give him about 2 months and I'm worried about the mall..., but it's not my fault, he's never wanted to take the chance to get to know me or anything, I met him once and as far as I could tell he was a pretty big fuck up. he left my grandma, when my dad was 12 and moved to fucking canada, only saw his kids like once a year and then finally stopped seeing them all together, never cared to get to know his 7 grandchildren or his 1 great grandchild. Nope not him. He smoked so many cigarettes (which is why he's dying::lung cancer) it was the most disgusting thing I've ever encountered. It's just hard for me to feel bad, when he hasn't been much of anything to me in my life. but i'm going on like someone cares haha...bllaahhh....
