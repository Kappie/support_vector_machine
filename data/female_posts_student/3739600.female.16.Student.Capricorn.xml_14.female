It's better than nothing at all. I just really wanted it to work out. I had really strong feelings for him. I think that I really a breakoff of relationships for some time(avery long time). I still love him more than anything and I always will. I can't change how I feel for him, so I'll just live with it. I wish him the best and hope to at least remain friends with him.   Lovve always, Brandi*
