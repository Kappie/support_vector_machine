When I came home I told my mom what was said and she blew up as expected. Guys, all I can say is I'm about one minute away from running away from this house. I can't be here any more, it feels like the cheery blue walls of my room are closing in. I don't wanna be alone. I want someone to just pop in here and hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay. I hate all this fighting. I hate this yelling. Why can't we all just be happy? When I have a family none of this shit is gonna go down. None of it. I won't tolerate it. I was just checkin how I would get out my window. The brick is a little too thin but I think I could make it. I told Greg to keep an eye out for me till 1:30. Things are dying down though so I might be able to make it through the night. Damn. XOXOX
