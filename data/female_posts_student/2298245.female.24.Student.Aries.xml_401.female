The press corps traveling with President Bush in Normandy first heard the news when ABC's White House reporter Terry Moran began doing a live report in their midst. The reaction, according to one eyewitness, was "total chaos â€” people running everywhere, knocking into things." CNN's John King yelled into his cellphone that CNN had been beaten and was so upset he threatened to quit. King ended his tan trum by throwing his cellphone to the ground. Bad move: his meltdown was captured on tape. So just how did ABC get such a big jump? The network refused comment, but insiders credit ABC News chief David Westin. Apparently, working the phones produces better results than throwing them.    I like the image of John King throwing his cell phone.  It reminds me of that scene from the movie Primary Colors, when the character who is supposed to be Clinton throws his cell phone out the window of a moving car.  They have to stop and go back for it, and when his wife proclaims that she has found it, he states emphatically that she never would have found it if he hadn't thrown it out the window.  Priceless.  The chaos thing also reminds me of the sheer insanity that happened with the Martha Stewart verdict.  The network I was watching actually got it wrong.  I guess the odd signals they were using to get message of the verdict out didn't work to well.  I don't remember which one I was watching.  Oh, wait,  urlLink yes I do .   I heard the news of Reagan's passing while sitting in Burger Heaven, semi-watching the Yankees game.  All of the sudden, I looked up at the screen, knowing that the game was still in the middle, and wondered why the fans were all standing and singing.  Then I realized, from the closed captioning, that they were singing God Bless America, and before I could wonder why, they flashed a picture of Ronald Reagan on the screen.  My friend, who is a liberal, found this a most unfortunate occurrence.  I just found it odd, until I remembered that I had seen a headline just that morning referring to Reagan's rapidly deteriorating health.  Both of us came to the conclusion at the same time that he must have died.  My friend graciously refrained from saying anything.  Murmurs rippled across the restaurant as the news passed, and people started pulling out their cell phones to confirm.  The manager switched the TV to CNN and turned the volume up.  I called my family but no one answered.    It is strange to recall in such detail.  There are only a handful of events in history where I can remember exactly what I was doing when they occurred.  Both of the deaths of Presidents during my cognizant lifetime are on the list.  I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when Nixon died as well.  It is amazing to me how one person can become so tied to the identity of a nation that when that person dies, it is as if a part of the nation dies with him.  It is a reminder that all of those from a different time are leaving us, one by one, and soon they will all be gone and we will be denied of their presence forever, or at least until we die ourselves.  It is a reminder, most of all, of the ultimate fragility of the state in which we live...as any state must be without a despotic and immortal leader.  And it should resolve us to make sure that the nation stays strong, that the bulk of it goes on, even if slightly battered and forever changed.
