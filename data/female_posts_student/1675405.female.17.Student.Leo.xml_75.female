Perhaps if the transition from being put up with to hated was gradual, I could handle this rapid decline. But it's not like that. It's all of a sudden, and just as people's opinion of me has lowered, my outlook on life has taken a nosedive. I know I cannot deal with this for much longer. I tell myself I can, but deep down I know that I am not strong enough to swallow the hatred that the last month--and all of the people and places-- has thrown into my face. I guess I'll wake up tomorrow, it will be another day, I will fall even lower, and go to sleep again.   Marie came over tonight and we went out to ice cream. A medium turtle sundae to be exact, and absolutely delicious at that. It actually was the highlight of my day thus far, and again I find it amazing that I can have such a horrible day... such a horrible week, and something so small can make me feel better instantaneously. And what's more, how quickly I can fall back into this limbo land where anything and everything can leave me in tears. This is wrong, it feels wrong. A person should not feel like this. Ever.
