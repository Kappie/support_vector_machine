All the junior and senior girls had to wear white dresses, and the guys had to wear suits with blue striped ties.  Everyone looked really good!  The breakfast was at this gorgeous country club by my school at 8:30.  We had breakfast and heard speeches from the class presidents, then we still had an hour before the assembly so Ellen and I went to Starbucks blasting old school *NSYNC and waving to random people in cars.  It's weird... the guys all wave back and smile but the girl we waved at gave us this really mean freaky look.  Girls are dumb.  I got a Strawberries  Cream frappuccino which was REALLY GOOD!  It tasted like a strawberry creamsaver in frappuccino form.  Then the assembly started, and of course the same like six people got all the awards.  Ellen had a program and wrote down guesses for who would get all the awards and she got 22 out of 31 right, its so predictable!  Right after the assembly was the Ring Ceremony, where the seniors give the juniors their class rings and sing them a song, and us officially becoming the senior class.  I of course didn't buy the ugly class ring (who pays like 200 dollars for that ugly shit? not me!) so Maria gave me an imaginary ring.  It's quite pretty if I say so myself.  Ellen, Ryan and I hung out for a while then I went home.  I realized I still have to clean out my locker but meh.  I'm too lazy.  I was going to go see Shrek early today with my dad but of course my mom said to take the 8 year old next door neighbor, who we have to wait for, and then the neighbor's mom wants to come too so we have to wait for HER until the end of the day.  Stupid people, you're ruining all my plans, I hate you.
