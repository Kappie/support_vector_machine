It is incredibly boring And it very hard to type this becuase Huge is patrolling I just finished havin Chapel God it is seriously boring. We had to sing that Shine, Jesus, Shine song, and it is sooo high, and my voice totally wont go there 2day because I am getting sick. :( And I've lost my glasses. So I'm like blind and can't read nething that is further than an arms length away. Ahhh, my poor glasses, wandering around the school somewhere, all by themselves. I hope they turn up soon. Mel and Annie and I had a plaster fight in Science Mrs. Hallet was very brave to give us an experiment 2 do that involved plaster. The expected outcome was acheived: plaster on us, on the science bench, on our aprons, on our faces and blazers, the experiment totally stuffed, and us rolling on the floor laughing. Ahhh, good times. And Kranny tried to get us into trouble on our way to school. We had already gone 2 SSO and were in the school gounds and didnt have our blazers on (which is totally allowed!) and she comes up to us and is all like - "Girls, you should have your blazers on!" And we're like, "But we're in the school grounds, we dont have to" And she didnt believe us that we had had them on coming in (which we didn't, but y'know she doesn't need 2 know that) and so she went 2 SSo to ASK THEM if we had been there! Haha. How stupid! Well obviously we didnt get in trouble though! Mwhahahaha.... Yay. I'm excited. I have a jam packed weekend which is good. Friday is small group and sleepout which I'm totally excited bout, and Gem is staying at mi place the whole weekend (Fri, Sat and SUn) because her parents r going away, and Sat Mel and I r trying 2 organise a thing with church people at either my house or hers, and I might try and fit something else in on Sat, maybe helping Jo advertise for World Cafe or somthing. I'll have to figure out my prioritys first. And I'm sure I'm doing sumthing Sunday day but right now I can't remember!! But the usual stuff is on, dance, ernie, church. Oh and yay Mel and I r performing our song 4 Ernie so we have to bring our guitars! Hehe..such musos. :D yay. I like weekends. School totally sux But I REALLY better go because I'm kinda abandoning my group here and I'm sposed 2 be working, so farewell all! Blogging off, Beth
