I'm bored and I was gonna post my fave lyrics. ...but i've realized they have no lyrics online and I don't feel like typing them all out. *sigh* Oh well. I'll post something...interesting.  I'm happy! GC has 2 new songs and apparently, their new album is called " The Chronicles Of Life And Death ." I kinda think it's all up in the air, but I'm excited to hear some new material from them.   I'm thinking I should clean up my room soon so I can get my Merry and Pippin shirt.  My CD scared me, I didn't know there was a bonus track  it popped on out of nowwhere. My heart fluxuated, LOL.  Is it just me or does Elijah Wood's Frodo promo pics look awkward? Like he's uncomfotable or something. I don't know. EXAMPLE!:           That's just an odd pose to me; it doesn't look natural. His other pictures look good though. Maybe these are early Frodo pictures  he wasn't used to things yet.  I want to add a few more things to this page. I put a no-right click code, just because I don't want no one even TRYING to take my stuff. If I make something and I don't care who takes it, I'll put a text link to it. Because in fact, I'll probably make general graphics that I don't care if people have. I made a Elijah wallpaper the other day and I'll link that in the side panel along with some other things. I'm going to rest afterwards though. LOL, so that's it.
