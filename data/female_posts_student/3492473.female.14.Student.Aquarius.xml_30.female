It's depressing and I'm  very  pissed off.  His reasons are bull shit  and he didn't even try talking this out. Yet he told me he loved me more than any other girlfriend. Whatever, I guess guys change how they feel. It hurts to know that our relationship ended  just like that . Yesterday at his game everything was fine but then something went wrong by the end of the night. Whatever, if he wants to be like that then fine. I'm probly going to the Cos Friday so  I'll just hook up with a few guys . Love is one thing ((meaning, it's special)) but flirting is a completely different story! Wink, Wink! I guess my way of dealing with pain now, is just forgetting about it and moving on. It's not like I can do  what I used  to...I've been clean for 6 wks... YAY!
