Some commercials are great.  Usually, they are not for cars.  Occasionally, there is a commercial that you really sit and watch.  Lately, these have been showing up online.  The latest big new one is  urlLink Seinfeld and Superman  for American Express.  Pretty clever.  I'm not encouraging anyone to go get an American Express card, but I AM encouraging everyone to memorize the Sing-a-long song.  That way you can all sing with me!!!  Oh, yes Wyoming!
