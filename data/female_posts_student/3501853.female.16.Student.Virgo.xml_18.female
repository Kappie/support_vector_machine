Okay so I was at school for some of the day. I finished my chemistry final and re-took an old chem quiz just so I could get a C in the class, I did it, got a 74 which sucks cuz I think C's are fails but in that class, I just needed to not get a D and I'd be fine with it, not happy but fine with it. Then drama finals was just dumb, I didn't really care. Then Szabo took me home, he's a funny kid. We drove his mom's pt cruiser and everyone knows I love pt cruisers.  Then I went home and basically laid down, thought, and slept a lot a lot. Seriously Ana and I called each other twice and I slept before and after each call and then I went online and she's like what are you up to and I felt so stupid saying I just woke up but I did so I had a total of like 5 naps. I hope she's notw orried because she used to just sit at home and sleep too the year after Louie's death and now I'm just sitting and sleeping but hopefully things will look up in reality soon where I don't have to sleep to escape..hopeful but doubtful..She and Jorge were having problems but luckily she's got it under control so that makes it now a year and something but it's so odd cuz i just remember it like yesterday her talking about a guy she met at bussee woods.  Anyways, then I went upstairs to take my 6th nap while watching along came polly and I rememebered I had to text Arthur so whatever I did and I guess him and Dennis needed a ride to a concert, the dp concert. At first, I felt awkward going so I said I"d just drop them off but then I went on-line and she IM'd me saying I should go to support so I went for her. I thought that tonight, I was going to gather up all the courage I had left, put away every ounce of pride or stubborness I have and say exactly how much I love aand miss her and how sorry I am. But fate just wouldn't work with me as usual. Well I'll get to why fate wouldn't cooperate later. Anyways I got Art and Dennis and that was fine and then we got to the theater, thanks to me by the way, I had to give myself directions somehow. We got there and it was weird cuz Matt p. saw me and right away goes inside and i'm like ookay.  Anyways, my heart was gut wrenching at this point like I told Art my hands were shaking like no mother fucking other. I was going to do it, work this out best I can cuz I need this. But then..I saw her smile and laugh with the gang and I don't know, I just couldn't get myself to go up to her and ruin her smile. So I thought I'd wait it out a bit. Things were awful for a bit just cuz I didn't know what to do so me and Art went outside and Michael n. joined us. He's single now. I just hope he doesn't regret it like I do cuz ya he might think it's easier now 2 deal w/his family issues w/out her but man when it's all said and done it's not easier so Idk, I hope the kid doesn't regret it and be sadder than he is now.  Then we went back inside after Art got his enphysema [lol] and me and Michael were just sitting there and I watched this scene unfold right in front of me and I swear to god, my heart broke. I just got so upset like omygosh no. That's when I knew I couldn't talk to her now, she was going through a lot more, she didn't need more on her plate. But I do kind of regret right now that I at least didn't say something like are you okay. Cuz after all this, nothing's changed, I still love her and when she hurts ya I still hurt. But I can't be anymore like dude don't hurt her when I hurt her too. =\ So ya, I'm just wondering if she's okay right now. But it sucks, I really needed to make amends with her but it was bad timing. Plus, I saw her with the whole gang and it's like camille you don't even know how she feels and I know the best way to find out is by talking to her but maybe i'm not prepared 2 hear the worst if that's what it's all come down to, i can't even like see happy things w/out missing her. I miss hearing her laugh [like i listen to that one voicetag but it's not the same], i miss singing country songs w/her or singing sublime together, i miss exchanging shoes for chemistry, i miss the hugs, i miss missing each other during theater fest, i miss telling each other stories that no one else would get, i miss stomping on states made from chalk with her at forest park, i miss her dog sniffing me after a dance, i miss listening to her, i miss watchin our favorite tv show, i miss sitting in back of cars on speakers, i just miss talking.  I don't know, I just hope my prayers can be answered. I'm over listening what other people say supposedly happened cuz I'd listen to my heart over what people say supposedly was said any day. I know it was my fault but that friendship means too much for my heart to let go, so we'll see, we'll see what happens... So ya that's that basically. I went by Kevin during Premium and before that too because ya I told him last night how much I didn't want to lose him either so he knows I mean this and we've gotten closer again yes. So ya I go by him, he's all giving me hugs which is fine with me it's kev kev who cares. But then I felt bad after a while because Jamie R. seemed upset with me for it. But I had a talk with Kevin and I just want him to be happy and I think he's learned not to hold back his feelings anymore, so hopefully it'll all work out with whoever the loser [lol] wishes. I can't remember if it was before or after Premium's great performance that I had my only little break down of the long night. But I was sitting by Kevin and I was upset but I could also tell he was upset so I didn't want to bother him but the tears were coming so I went in the bathroom. And ya I was weak but I just couldn't help it..I was upset over how she was hurting mostly and I was also upset over him. I don't really want to write about him and me because it hurts just to even think about it. But I cried cuz we don't even talk like I seriously thought we were going to be still great friends and we'd "never say bye" but we did, it sucks so much. No guy can replace him man, no one, I'm not afraid of saying that cuz I'm pretty sure that right now no there is no one else but him I even consider as a potential guy. But I cried over him a lil bit 2night because I saw him smile and his eyes gleam and that he's forgotten about me and the way his eyes gleamed, that used to be how it was when he saw me smile. But he doesn't know, only he could make me smile like that. My smiles now are so fake I can't even see what he saw in me in the 1st place. Only he brought out that one smile, and I can't ever get it back. I just wish we could talk about how we felt but I doubt that will ever happen. He likes so many other girls I bet by now, I wonder if he still knows my name but I got butterflies in my heart from him 2night,he talked 2 me well more like asked me for money but it was still his voice talking to me.  Man I am stupid for screwing thigns up with the both of them, fucking stupid. I'm stupid for another person but I can't deal with thinking of that right now ehh i might just cry 2 think 2 much of that. Anywho, after Dennis' hilarious incident with these 2 icky girls "bitch", me art and dennis went home. My dumb ass pulled out of the parking lot the wrong way so I had a whole bunch of cars headed for me and I had to go through the rail road tracks luckily they all saw i was in the wrong lane and let me slip by into the library's parking lot. We made a pit stop at billiard's for art then I took them home. My mom called me like no joke 10 times and I didn't pick up cuz I was with dennis and art and she didn't know that. So I got home and I was bitched at and basically grounded from the car for who knows how long. I don't car as sad as that sounds but this night just exhausted my emotions and I'm still feeling low so I don't really need a car unless she can drive me but besides that, I think she was just worried cuz it was raining really hard so hopefully I'll get the priveleges back.  Well I've wrote enough another time I'm thankful no one reads this czu this is just a lot of nagging and venting..but on a last note, to prove that today just was not meant to be my day, lakers lost bad...
