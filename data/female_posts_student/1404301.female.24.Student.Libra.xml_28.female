There are 22 rounds of Australian football during the season and the 16 teams play against each other until the 22nd round. After that, the 8 top teams on the ladder get to play in the final rounds, it is a bit like soccer in France (for the ones who don't know).  Well, this week end is round 14 and I got to be ranked 2,550 out of 10,449 tippers. Not bad for a Frenchy, hey!  Anyway, I hope I will get better and better, just for fun...In fact I wouldn't mind winning the first price, going on holiday with my prince in the Bahamas isn't a bad idea!! Hope makes you live!!
