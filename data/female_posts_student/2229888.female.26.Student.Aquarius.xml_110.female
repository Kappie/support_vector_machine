I need help. seriously. lol  anyway, so I dooo feel better today, though my throat is giving me a bit of a fit. Sky took his first really good steps! I am so proud. He walked to me several times tofay from 3-f feet away. Isnt' he just the smartest baby ever? Of course, I was walking at 9 mos... I'm glad he decided not to follow my example. i have no idea how I am going to keep up with him as it is!  I am in a great mood today. I am in a WRITING mood, even! I've been working on a new Christian kids' book. It's about three missionary teens who solve mysteries and stuff. I think it's going to turn out really well.
