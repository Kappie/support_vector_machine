I don't understand it but, it seems as if the whole Michelle threatening to kill herself has brought me down a notch. As soon as I got home from work my mind just sunk a level. The whole day I was in a good mood. I think I will probably go see a movie tonight, something funny, and see if I am able to pull myself out. The only thing I did find amusing today was when I threw have my bagel out the car window and hit a SUV. God damn soccer moms.
