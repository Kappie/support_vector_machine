Nothing to do.  Of course, homework is out of the question.  No way. Ok, if Kifner has that test the minute we get back I really might cry.  And throw things.  What a stupid moron.  He probably showed up every day this week to greet us, but we weren't there, you ape of a man!!  Ha, I'm so evil to him.  I don't even care.  People are like, "What if that's you one day?"  and I'm like, "Uhh, guys have you met Annie Medlin?  I'll never be a teacher!" Ahh, I'm disappointed about this week's sbemail.  Come on, Chaps.  You can do better than that.  Oy. You know what sucks?  This thing runs on pacific time, that's what.  So add three hours to everything, if you like.  That way you won't be jealous and think that I've slowed time some how. Ok, this thing is getting weird.  So I will leave.
