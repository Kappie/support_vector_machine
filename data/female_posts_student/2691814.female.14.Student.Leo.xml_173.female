GRR, i hate summer!! I wish it were over.....well it will be in a few days. But i cannot express how much i hate summer.  ok welli guess im just venting a bit but wtf i dont care. Anyway, to add to the torture, i went to the beach today and go burned......nice going eh?  I think im going to IOA for my b-day, i wanna ride Dueling Dragons fire...due to the fact i already rode ice in may. But ya, so we're thinking, get up really early and just go to orlando and then drive home again at the end of the day.Im all alone....... :( as usual, i need ahug *haha*  Deidras leaving for New Jersey soon...2 days after my b-day so i KNOW i wont be seeing her any time soon. And ryan well he's in Buffalo, not like we talk much anyway. Im gonna e-mail francesca now.
