And by retarded I mean slow.  She talks like she's got a speech problem.... you know Stevie from  urlLink Malcolm in the Middle ?  Yeah, she talks like that.  By the end of the class I wanted to choke myself.  We already have a reading for that class.  We're reading Moliere's Tartuffe.  Oh, yay!  It's in verse.  Everything rhymes.  It's sorta sickening.  It's not romantic verse like Shakespeare... :-(  But all in all, I'm excited about the course!  I think it's going to be fun... and I actually am glad I can do a research paper again.  A nice lengthy 10 page one!  :-)  My Texas Politics and Society professor (Startin) is awesome.  I pity him for leaning towards the conservative end of the spectrum, but he's still cool.  He doesn't tell CHEESY jokes... that's the norm for his age group of men.  He was in the air force for 35 years.  He retired 5 years ago, and has been teaching the past 4 years.  He said the norm average for his class is A.  I'm excited.  My Early Childhood prof... well, he's like a mix between Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.  Being that his teeth remind me of Austin Powers' and some things that he says (like "riiiight") remind me of Dr. Evil.  He wants to be Walker, Texas Ranger, though.  He's VERY much a cowboy.  He wears boots, a stetson, and a western print jacket.  He's cool, though.  Even though our class is supposed to meet from 2-4:45 he said he'd pretty much let us out around 3:30 every class.  :-D  He also said the final is optional.  We have several opportunities to do different things.  Go to lectures, help build playgrounds, go check out something at the zoo playground.  The final is worth 100 points.  Working on a playground project is worth 150 points.  So there ya go.  ;-)  My Education prof seems very nice.  She's one of those women who loves to teach.  It's obvious.  She's cheery, and when she was talking to us she was telling us how her objective for the semester is to help everyone get an A.  Now I dunno how she plans to do that with a class of 250+ students.  But by all means, be my guest to try lady!  :-)  I'm all about getting an A!!!  Last but not least my Music class is going to be friggin AWESOME!  I have Dr. Bruenger once again (I had her for Masterpieces last semester) and we just have a BUNCH of fun in that class.  Yesterday we sang a song to get to know each other.  I felt like I was in elementary music class again!  We do lots of stuff like that, as well as getting to write a play in our groups!  It's complete with music and sound effects, etc!  Such an easy term project, cause it'll be fun!  In all, I'm very excited about my classes now!  I think that I could actually pull off all A's!  Wouldn't THAT be cool?!  I'm very hyped up to start things.... so much so that as soon as I got my World Lit book, I began reading the Moliere play...  I'm also excited that I will only have 2 finals this semester!  WAHOO!  That makes me so happy!  I dunno if I'll devote time to a job to earn money to visit England or not.  We'll see, though.  I'd like to get a small job to have a bit of extra cash.  I was thinking of applying at Borders or something.  Maybe I could get to do like a Storytime thing with little kids there!  That'd be so awesome.  Anyhoo... that's all I have for now... but I'll come up with more things to say during the semester!!!  :-)  You can GUARANTEE it!        urlLink  postCount('15Jan2003');
