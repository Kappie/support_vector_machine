       
      from going home and part of me can't wait to get back.  I always know it will happen, but it still surprises me when I get my fill of home life and yearn for my own space again.    Spent two days in Salt Lake with Mom, shopping our asses off and having a pretty good time, including a big gay talk on the side.  My system is still in shock over the recent increase in the subject's discussion and overall, it's a good thing.  But I'm coming away with the feeling that even with the new openness, they still don't know me.  Part of it is because there are things I can't and won't tell them, but part of it, at least as far as Mom's concerned, is her thing she does about seeing everything from her perspective.  Never was a good one for empathy.  She sees things the way  she  sees them and is not big on taking a look from the other person's viewpoint.  She doesn't understand how I could be "so upset" at the cousins asking me about myself when I flash my tattoo around, have a HRC sticker on my car and have told people with "direct links" to my parents.  When I try to explain how I've tried to shield her and Dad from having to deal (in a negative way) with an issue they struggle so much with (and also because she once told me never to tell anyone she knew because she couldn't defend something she doesn't agree with), she tells me I should let all that effort and worry go (sounds good, huh?) because I've already acted in all these ways that let everyone around her know anyway.    It's been 5 years, after all, and really, I should know how far they've progressed even though we haven't discussed it as much in those 5 years as we have in the last 2 weeks.  If I really am as open and okay with it as I say I am, I shouldn't be so surprised when my family members bring it up and want to talk to me about it.    And then we get to the part about looking for a partner.  Really, I've only just started finding a social group and relating to people in a way I never have before (most people do that when they're 16, you know).  I've spent so much time alone that maybe I'm just like those people who never find someone because they aren't willing to give up their space for the sake of a relationship.    It's hard to explain that I know exactly what I'm waiting for when I can't talk about my experiences.    Sigh.    I need to spend today by myself.  I think my way out of what I know when I'm here.  I start to think she has a point about all these things.  I start to see myself the way she does.
