Just need to do that final re-arranging in the car, vacuuming and I am out. Unfortunately, I woke up with an unbendable elbow. I can't do much because it hurts like hell, so I'll need to find my ibuprofen and dose up before the trip. Joanne was in from Switzerland for a tuberculosis meeting -  a huge surprise - so I went to see her at boy's. She looked great. It's raining (remnants of the tropical storm/hurricane from the gulf coast), so it should be an interesting way to go. More about the last interaction with boy later, which mostly consisted of awkward hugs (people were watching), his annoyance with my forgetting his vacuum and throwing prized tokens of love in the trash (to appease him, I have packed two posters that I would have otherwise left in his carport), and annoyance masking sadness ("What do you mean, you'll be driving at night? Joanne and I have conferred and we don't think it's a very good idea...")  We talked while atlbb cleaned out my fridge - he managed to show his concern, he croaked an "I love you" and "at least acknowledge that you've arrived, I need to know that you've gotten there safely"). Kinda sad. But I'm off to do better things. Like trying to find healthy food at gas stations sprinkled along 95.
