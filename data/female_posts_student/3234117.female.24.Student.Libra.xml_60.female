I mean who knows what kind of specials they'll be offering for my October move date.  It's still a ways away.  I'm a planner.  I like to know things in advance.  I get so stressed when I can't do so.  You know it's pretty bad when the last two nights I haven't been able to fall asleep without either (1) an alcoholic beverage or (2) half of a sleeping pill.  I'm dramatizing.  I'm making myself crazy.  I'm good at this.  I'll find an apartment.  On the brighter side.  Only 3 more classes! And I booked a trip with my friend, the tramp, to go to San Antonio in November for the Texas Psychological Association annual convention.  Sounds dull? I'm just exited to be taking a trip AND I get to stay in a hotel room for 3 nights.  AND I get to miss class.  The convention actually seems like it'll be interesting.  Lots of different seminars/workshops to go too.  One is how to survive graduate school and another one is about relationships.  I need help on both.  Apparantly.   I'm also going out to happy hour tonight with my friend, who I'll call Candie.  I need a drink.  She needs a drink.  I'm sure others need a drink and are welcome to come.  And I have money.  What a logical and coherent thought process!  Okay back to filing.  I've been here an hour and a half.  How much longer will I stay?  Speaking of.  I'm pretty sure end of this month I am going to be unemployed as I plan on quitting.  Should I put in a notice at 2 wks or now? Or should I try to work a little, like 2 hours each week and keep this job? Nah.  If I want to work extra I can always babysit or work at a church.  Good idea.
