I had a wierd wierd day. Bought a bunch of new clothes. (yaaay! I dont look like im homeless any more!!!) wheee! and its snowing outside. Snow makes me happy. Like rain. I wish that every time i cried it would rain... ::im only happy when it rains:: garbage is pretty.  My dad came and yelled at me today, cause apparently i didnt go to class. Then he decided it was my moms fault for letting the dog out ( i had to chase it cause it sucks) and then i was a 1/2 hour late, so i didnt go. So my dad was yelling at her, then he was yelling at me, then he was yelling at the dog... he's insane. he loves yelling at everything.   i hate to say it, but freaky friday was a damn good movie. So much like my life.  (except i dont eat fortune cookies and morph into 50 year old women. Although if i did, i would find something exciting that only really old women can do. Like drink a lot and then go shop at Ross. Or drink corn on the cob through a straw. ewww....)  im too lazy to look for more links, but i wanted to paste this one cause OH GOD! its a new and hilarious webcomic. GO THERE. LAUGH. PISS YOURSELF. DONT TELL ME ABOUT IT. http://www.moviepunks.com/?id=1  I smell. Im going to shower.
