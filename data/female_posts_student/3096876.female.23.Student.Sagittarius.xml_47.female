On Wednesday I went to a walk-in clinic (gaah!!!) because I had a real itch to have a speculum jammed in me. Hmmph. It was nerve-wracking, totally, sitting in that waiting room, over-analyzing everything...   Did I have to stutter when the nurse asked why I was here? Why are my hands shaking? I hope it's a female doctor...     When the doctor came in I was relieved to see it was a woman, even if the relief was only marginal. "Your sheet says that you want an STD test? Can I ask why?"  I explained the situation to her, that I have cervical dysplasia, that I don't feel that either my GP or my specialist have been pro-active in terms of my sexual health, and I can't remember the last time I even had an STD test. And of course, I had been with Brent for five years...but then there was Anil, and now Mike.   "Well, if you're going through partners, it's really best to use condoms..." she said.  Yeah, we're using them, but it would be nice not to have a  heart-attack  if ever they don't get used, ok? Is it just me, or is it near impossible to get a straight answer or simple obedience from anyone in the medical field???   To give the woman some credit, once I explained the situation to her, she hashed things out pretty clearly, and she cut me some slack: "It seems like you've really gone through a lot in the last couple of months, and I can understand why you're very anxious to put all this behind you." You're damn right!   She gave me a whole battery of tests, and really reassured me, to tell the truth. She told me that I got referred to Princess Margaret because I'm young and an otherwise healthy young woman, so they want the best doctors with the best resources to get on top of this right away, so that they can eliminate it from my life. Yeah, that would be really nice...   Later on, I called my Mom--she saidmy specialists' office had called, and I have an appointment on August 5 at Princess Margaret. I'm glad to know that it's soon, though I'm still a little scared about what's going to happen next. The bottom line with all of this: it's a waiting game. All I can do is wait for my appointment at PM, wait for information from them afterwards, and then wait, wait, wait for my next follow-up appointment, and very likely more surgery. I'm not looking forward to more surgery, but I'll do whatever it takes to get this done.   On Friday, Ashley took me out for lunch. I decided I'd tell him what was going on. Ashley's one of the few people at work that I like, other than my very favorite Mona, and I really feel like I can trust him. Mostly, he was just concerned with how I was feeling on the psychological side. After losing a friend to a mental illness, one that he was completely unaware of, I can understand that he's going to be very observant from now on. I assured him that I'm doing ok, and it's true. So many friends have offered their support, and my parents are starting to understand more and be angry less.   And as far as my checklist...   1.I've takena multi-vitamin everyday since last week,    2. I'm drinking a ton of water,   although admittedly, when I go out on the town I'm drinking a lot of drinks that contain very little water...    3. Going   to school two days a week means plenty of walking ,  but I still haven't seen the inside of my gym. Why am I so scared to go back?    4. This is the only one I've failed miserably at: More Sleep. I need it desperately, but I've just been so busy this week. I will make a stronger conscious effort.
