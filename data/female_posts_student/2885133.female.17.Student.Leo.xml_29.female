Anyhow, my art history class will be done on July 8th and I completed my biology assignment. This sense of completion and basically and open summer sort of made me into a ditz than a workaholic.  Strangeness of the day:    I started the day with conversation about swimming up the river of de-Nial with sunscreen as protection.   My breakfast consisted of fruit. Supposedly healthy, but I basically didn't have breakfast. I think my dad think I may have an eating disorder... Erm, I don't have a problem with my body weight although I can make myself throw up on cue, but that;s due to my allergies and nasal drip that causes me to choke.   I had pancakes for dinner. Also, Asian family making pancake... Not a pretty sight. Of course, the one person in the house that can't cook Chinese food makes the perfect pancakes. Unfortunately, my mother's cooking isn't always consistent. At least I can sort of make pancakes...   I have decided that I needed a best friend. As in singular... One friend that I can depend on and chat freely without feeling the need to pretend.   Adding onto the list... My dad thinks I have insomnia. Hm, that was determined awhile ago.    Well, must go to sleep before my dad goes ballistic about being healthy.
