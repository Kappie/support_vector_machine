((driving me bat-shit-zu, as tr0y would say)) not to mention the fact that the pool is the most horrendous shade of green i've ever seen. i guess i shouldn't complain though.  tomorow the harry potter movie comes out and, staying true to the book geek ideals, i'm TOTALLY PSYCHED. i'm sure it's plenty edited so that it will apply to all age groups, which sucks, but it's understansably so. either way, i will like it and i will see it at least three times before i tire of looking at the adorable face of daniel radcliffe, who plays harry. i love these british guys! i could just totally take daniel and put him on a cracker.  i think i'm reading a little too much of  urlLink Tiffany's Blog . i checked my poem "Cirque" and it's like, was i on drugs? i guess now that it's summer and i'm all relaxed my mind is free enough to come up with that kind of stuff. i like it.  today i hung out and watched "the others" avec mes amies. i like this movie. it's like, scary, but not so much that i'm freaked out for the rest of the day. plus it's a good story. we acted out the play that inspired the movie in drama class freshman year, it was good too.   i'm totally bored out of my mind.
