I don't know why I'm starting a blog, actually I don't know a lot of things, maybe that's my problem! Okay this is for all you people out there who have such lack of lives that you have to read about mine. The following is info about me   Species: The US did testing on me, so that's not a good sign Name: Uh, Can't remember Age: Not Legal Sex: Still Virgin Race: I thought color didn't matter? Height: Anyone got a ruler? Weight: Still measuring my height Dating Status: Today is June 12, 2004 Hair Color: I didn't learn my colors in kindergarden, so take a wild guess Eye Color: Let me get my mirror Characteristics: Aren't characters from cartoons? Hobbies: Doing things that I like to do  Well now you know me! Geez, you guys probably know more about me now, then I know about myself! Wait that doesn't make sense............Nevermind! Well Chow for Now
