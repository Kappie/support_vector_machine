It was pretty hard to keep that relationship going long, first with the pressure within it, and what worse, pressure from everyone attacking everyone else. It was a battle for a hile there.  By the way, whom of these good friends keep sending these bastard emails about you and Lindsey breaking up? Jesus H. Christ, it seems like you're constantly under attack, and I'm positive you're a quality guy. It just bewilders me as to why someone would keep up this kind of an attack.  Why yes, Lindsey, Jackie only posted on here once, and it was about her and her fiancé or something like that; it was really quick. And I shall be there, of course.  Have a  GREAT  day everyone, life is  SO  wonderful.
