There is finally stuff to do here for the 4th and we're leaving!! Argh... oh well- at least I get to go to the picnic tonight. That should be fun even though there is no  !!!freaking!!!  way  anyone  (that includes you Mario!!!) is going to get me to play volleyball no matter how much begging or pleading (or bribing) goes on. I hate volleyball!! Probably has something to do with that time I almost broke my nose- I am permanently scarred!  Anyways, I was reading this book the other night, about Tamar (the woman in the Bible who tricked Jacob into sleeping with her so that she could rightfully bear the son she owed to Jacob's dead firstborn son- her husband Er, who died... got that? Confusing story really!!! You can find it in Genesis, chapters 37 and 38) and about how she converted from the faith of her fathers and believed in the Lord God of Isreal. The Lord honored her conversion by allowing one of her sons to be a direct anscestor of Jesus Christ!! How awesome is that?? God used a once pagan woman to bear one of the great-great (on and on and on!!) grandfathers of our Savior!! Just goes to show how the Lord honors those who are faithful and who cling to His Will!! His timing is always perfect... I really need to remember that one! Sometimes its hard to be patient though- I mean, there are things going on right now that I really feel like should happen and I desperately want direction and guidence from the Lord, but I feel like God is just waiting until I am still. Why cant I be still???? :)   Oh well- at least I am trying!! Anyways, I should probably get back to packing... long ways to go on that one! I'm only gonna be gone from Saturday till Monday afternoon and yet I am packing like a trunkful of stuff- I really need to simplify!! Sometimes I can be such a girl! Tee hee... I am gonna miss everyone while I am gone!!! Les- only 8 days left.. you go girl! Mario~ I promise never to throw a chankla at you... at least not intentionally (you know how bad my aim is!! ;-) Kait, girl.. you're so cra-z! What are you writing in your blog that I cant see... oooo I am so gonna tell on you! (just kidding!) Lizzie- We've got to get together!! Start returning my phone calls when I am actually at home! We play wayyyyy too much phone tag, lol! Bonnie: what's the deal??? I have no clue what I did but whatever it was, I'm sorry!! Call me!! Ummmmm- yeah, that's basically it. Peace, im out!
