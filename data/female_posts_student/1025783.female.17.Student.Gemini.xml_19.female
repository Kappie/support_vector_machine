Dance along, sing under trees and under rain Are you so afraid of the climax, the thriller and the way of life> Don't be afraid of me. I'm tall and skinny and pale and dirty blonde and i have worries and problems and factors. Yes, I am a teenager and if you do pause on your heels to listen to my message, you probably won't take me seriously But I'm ok with that Because I know I make a difference I am tall, and strong and so proud of all I am.
