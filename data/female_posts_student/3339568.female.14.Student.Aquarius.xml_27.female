The only bad thing is that now all mi old comments are gone, but it doesn't matter because it's worth it! So people reading mi blog (if neone actually does :P) don't think I'm a loner person with no comments, I actually do get comments, they r just not there because of Haloscan! Oh yeh and how cool, I might be added to that Blog Waterhole thing. Yay! I'll have to link 2 it.. But neway, Yay 4 Tom!
