Well, Angel and Demon went psycho when I opened their cage and i now have a gridwork of scratches on my right inner elbow and forearm. Ah well, I love those puppies. I have officially named the bratty Siamese cat Oscar, after the Grouch in Sesame Street. Did I tell you that when i was 5 I starred in a Sesame Street film called "Super Grover and the Wild Duckie Chase" when I went to Sesame Street world or whatever...I had chicken pox. I have the video if anyone wants to see me cute and little.  Well, for the five people that this affects, MY PARTY'S TOMORROW! Erin, my mommy's coming to pick you up at 11:15, and then your mommy can come and get you at our house. Okeeday? Okay. And, Tracy, Ashley, and Allison, meet at the East Granby Library...okay? Marquis will LOVE you...well, with the exception of Ashley, whom marquis wishes dead...they'll love allison, already met erin, and tracy's FROM granby, so.. Love, April
