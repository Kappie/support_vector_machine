It is finally here and Sarah, her mom, and i leave for Padre in about an hour who would have ever thought that I would be so xicted to leave this town well I guess it it not so much the town more like the ppl.  I am so happy like I cant wait to get in the car and just leave i want to leave right now just to get away from here for a week I am going to have a blast no matter what I think I deserve a good vacation after the past few weeks and i dont know that it could get any better b/c I get to go with my best friend who has been there for me through everything and I am so thankful that I have a friend like her.  I will miss my parents and my siblings and prolly monte and pt but other than that I dont know that I will miss any of my friends b/c some of those ppl just arent friends and are back stabbers but what can you do?  I hope everyone else has fun staying here i will miss a couple of you but not a whole lot so dont flatter yourself b/c you are prolly one of the ones I wont miss..........:)   Love ya' Jess
