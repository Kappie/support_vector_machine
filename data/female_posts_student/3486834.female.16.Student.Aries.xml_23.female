I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE, NOT TO PLAY WITH FIRE!! i did, and i burnt myself bad.lol. it hurt.. badly! then i bruised my heel somehow, and got a thorn stuck in my foot. more pain. me and laura didn't go to sleep at all. we woke kelsey up around 5. the sun was almost up. so we went outside to try and fall asleep on the trampoline. i didn't work.. haha! around 6 we just took and walked the dogs, sorta. one of the dog's ran of and started attacking a stray kitten. my instincts were to save it.. so i tried to get all of the dogs away,. when i did, the kitten just laid there. we used a shirt to grab it. by the kitten bit me soo hard. i was bleeding pretty badly. we took it to mary's cause she can help the cat.. i felt so bad.. but then the cat bit me again.. i don't think she made it. :'(! after all of that, we all took a 5 hour nap. then went four-wheeling! fun! my mom had to pick me up around 6. we went out o eat. now i am here. bored.. and tired..
