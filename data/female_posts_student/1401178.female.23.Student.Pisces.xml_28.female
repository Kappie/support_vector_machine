Only this time it's  urlLink Hugh Jackman , instead of  urlLink Brendan Fraser .  urlLink Kate Beckinsale  instead of  urlLink Rachel Weisz . And it's Count Draculla instead of Imhotep. The action was good. One thing about this  urlLink Stephen Sommers ' movie...like it's predecessor it was damn good thriller. Every scary scene, I could feel the intensity. And the hair on the back of my neck started to rise. I remember I was holding the collar part of my t-shirt, ready to pull it up and hide.  But I also remember how buff  urlLink Hugh Jackman  is. Especially when he ripped his shirt, ready to turn into werewolf to kill Count Draculla. Wooooohooo! A feast for a woman's eyes. There are a lot of scenes showing  urlLink Hugh Jackman 's buff body. It's one of it's strong point I must say. But there aren't much...well, exposure other than that. The vampire brides wear these sexy outfit, but not too sexy.  urlLink Kate Beckinsale  wears this corset kind of outfit. The only exposure done are by the men of the story.  One notable performance is by  urlLink Lord of the Ring 's Faramir,  urlLink David Wenham . It's a total turnaround from his role in the famous trilogy.  urlLink David Wenham  plays the role of Carl, the friar that follows Van Helsing to Transylvania. Carl provided the comic relief in most of the scene. He's clumsy, slow-witted, scared easily. But what fascinate me is that it's different role from Faramir. But  urlLink David Wenham  play it excellently. He did great. He made me laugh uncontrolably...a lot. Well, that happened maybe becoz I was comparing him the Faramir through out the movie. My fave scene is the one when Carl and Van Helsing are in Rome, under the cathedral. Carl is showing Van Helsing around, when he shows him a big batch of glyserine. He takes a drop on his finger, and throws it toward a bunch of barrels. The barrels explodes, surprising people. Carl appologizes, and when he turns around facing the camera he's wearing this thing (looks like a goggle or glasses, just like the one  urlLink Johnny Depp  wears in  urlLink Sleepy Hollow ) and it makes his eyes looks bigger. And that just hit me like...a lightning of tickles, and I laugh so hard! So hard, I have to hold myself back real hard not to laugh outloud (nobody's laughing...or at least what I remembered). Good job,  urlLink David Wenham !  I didn't put this post on my other blog ( urlLink Lemontee's Favorite Things ). Despite I love  urlLink David Wenham 's performance in it, it's not that good overall. Especially the vampire part, it's a bit lame. Seriously. Totally lame. Even  urlLink Queen of the Damned  looks better than that.
