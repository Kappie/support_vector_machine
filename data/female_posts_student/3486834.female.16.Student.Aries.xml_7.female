I went to my aunt's lakehouse over the weekend. I got like and awesome tan. Gary didn't bring his boat tho. So we were stuck with a stupid sail boat. I started to think possitive and then there was no wind.. How lame is that. Emily was scared at the lakehouse cause my mom told us that Shelley's (my aunt) grandfater died in one of the beds we were sleeping in. And she wouldn't tell us which one it was. (we faught over who was gunna sleep on the top bunk, cause emily said that old guys don't sleep on the top bunk. lol) Then I told my aunt the story that my mom told me and Shelley said that it totally wasn't true. Her grandfather died in the BATHTUB, while taking a bath, if you didn't already guess that. Like that was even better.. So I had quite an experience up at the lake.  Then I don't really remember doing anything else other than that and going to the mall... yeah my life is SO exciting!!! *sighs* Today I woke up SUPER early. It was like 9 or something. So that was pretty lame. We were gunna go up to World Market to get something for my granddad for Father's Day. It would've worked out, if my mom didn't lose one of her credit cards. And she didn't bring her checkbook. AND she didn't have any cash on her. Funny how that happens. After stressing over all of that, we went to the Lexus dealership.. we were accually on time. That's a first.. My mom's car is like messing up. Bummer. Now we have a loner car for a couple of days. YAY! I can't wait to drive it ;). Around 11, we went to my Grandad's restaurant for lunch. Yummmay! I washed dishes behind the bar. No one paid me either. I should get extra for just being so cute behind the bar =D. We finally headed home around 3. On the way home, I found myself singing Papa Roach with my mom. LOL. I feel as if we bonded somehow... This weekend is the Warp or Wharp or something Tour. Yellowcard, Coheed and Cambria, The Story of the Year, and like a dozen other bands are gunna be in it. That makes me mad.. cause I didn't get tickets.. NOT fair. I think they are sold out.. but who knows.. I am gunna call around. I may know some people that know some people that are friends with people that can get me tickets. i am just that special! hehe.   I wonder where Jennifer is..*Jennifer if you are out there, CALL ME* I haven't talked to her since Felisha was over at her house. And Heather said that she hasn't talked to her in 4 days or something. WOAH! I miss her.. *tear* I miss everyone. Especially this one special person that I miss the most. I have no idea where that came from. I am getting so bored lately that I start to MISS school. Something is seriously wrong with me now..   Jessica S. sent me the longest e-mail in the world, so I guess I should reply.. All of you out there should e-mail her. She said that I am the only one that has been e-mailing her back.. how sad. But she told me a really fun story about what happened to Kelsey at mission camp.. haha. It just made my day. bye
