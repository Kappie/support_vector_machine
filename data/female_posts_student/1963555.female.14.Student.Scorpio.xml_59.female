I'm soooo happy! I would've wanted OCDP or OPDP but I'm just grateful that I HAVE drums!! So Dacia and my band is underway! Her sister Brittney (Sorry If I spelt that wrong!) has been teaching her some begining tunes to Nirvana. Now I got my drums...... Oh yeah the name is Aceon. Well gotta go bye!
