I now need to find a new job, I quit because I couldn't be bothered anymore and when i told my boss that I was going to be leaving he got really angry because apparently "I'm leaving them in the busy period which puts them in the lurch" and told me not to come to him for a reference because I have just shown him that I am unreliable...good one Trev...I can't say I didn't always know that he was a bit of a twat.  However yesterday wasn't all bad - it was beautiful and all sunshiney, so after handing my keys back (I got becca to do it while I crouched down in the back of thecar - v classy!)we went and bought lots of alcohol then went and had an ace barbeque. We met becca's mums new boyfriend, and all got drunk and stuffed our faces...then went to the park and played lots of fun games...so I guess it wasn't all bad - although I had a bad feeling in my stomach all day and I only realised what it was this morning...  I haven't told my mum that I quit - so I'm going to have to pretend to go to work and that, to be honest makes me feel, well, like an idiot! But I can't tell her that I quit because she'll only be angry because she'll think that I'm not being serious about going to canada so basically I am screwed!  Last night was horrible too because we were out playing Badminton in the garden, and I had to act like I was having fun too, even though inside I was thinking "shit! what the fuck will I do?!"   Basically inbetween now and uni/canada I need to get a full time job...but doing what?!
