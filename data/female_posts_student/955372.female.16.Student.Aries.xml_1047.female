It'd be all kinds of usefull. It'd make espresso. I'll could get people to pay for the espresso it'd make. I could throw it at people who didn't pay. Or at people who just happened to be standing there and I was bored... and a little crazy from all the espresso and money. Alright, that's it. Battery operated espresso maker is at the top of my Christmas list. And none of that batteries not included crap. Or I'll throw my batteryless battery operated espresso maker at you.
