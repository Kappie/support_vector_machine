I needed you today SoÂ where did you go? You told me to call Said you'd be there And though I haven't seen you  Are you still there?   Chorus I cried out with no reply And I can't feel you by my side So I'll hold tight to what I know You're here and I'm never alone   And though I cannot see you And I can't explain why Such a deep reassurance  You've placed in my life. We cannot separate 'Cause you're part of me. And though you're invisible I'll trust the unseen.
