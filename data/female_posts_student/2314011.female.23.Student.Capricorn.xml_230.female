Now I realize I've ruffled some feathers I'd never intended to ruffle and should try my best to alleviate the situation as best I can.  I'm reminded of my reaction to a friend's condescending attitude toward Middle Earth and all its beloved creatures around Oscar Time and want to apologize for donning a similar attitude here.  It was only meant in fun, I promise.  Now, I must stress that I AM a fan of the Harry Potter books.  Yes, like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I've been proven wrong by making like the dude in Green Eggs and Ham and just giving the books a try.  They're good, quality stuff.  There's no getting around it.  And I know I'll just come to love them more as I continue to complete them.  My previous post was never meant to besmirch the HP series itself or make excuses for my new-found fandom.  I simply am seeing similarities and chose to comment on them by making reference to my previously-held beliefs.  Yes, I've been proven wrong, and on some levels, I've been proven kind of right.    So now, all I can ask is your forgiveness for shitting on something sacred.  Send me to the Forbidden Forest.  Give me an extra Potions assignment.  But please, don't let this incident of thoughtlessness and "your world, my world" observations destroy what could become a moment of learning and...hopefully, winning.
