'what would it do to our friendship if i told you i liked you' but i just said i didn't like him like that but i hope we could have the same friendship .. so we do. I guess everything's cool with that. I kinda feel bad tho. I hope i dont lead people on like that. Especiallyhim cause he's an awesome kid and I would never want to hurt him. Mandie told me not to break his heart so i tried really hard. Hopefullyhe didn't like me that much. I've known him for 5 months (since feb 14th) and they have been really great. Webecame good friends almost imediately and i would trust him with my life. I really hope thatcontinues.xo *later days   Beatles- Black Bird  "Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see.
