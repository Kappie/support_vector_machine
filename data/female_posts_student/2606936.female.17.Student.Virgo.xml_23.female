Fabulous, fabulous book. We're studying it in my IB LA/AP Lang-Comp class right now  However, it was incredibly yuck. Tasted like a potato covered in hairspray and anthrax.  Also, the girl who provided these morsels (who was doing a presentation on the symbology of food in the book) ordered them off the internet. So here I am, having eaten a frigging kola nut that came off the internet..... i mean, god knows who grew them, what kind of pesticides are on there.... they sure TASTED like pesticide.  And so then she tells us that the Ibo ate/eat a bit of it before each meal to help digestion.  I only took a small bite, but i did swallow. I mean, it's high school, fourth period, and our stomachs are eating themselves because we don't eat breakfast. But then I turn to the guy behind me, who probably ate about an entire half a kola nut, and said, "Is it weird that I can feel it digetsing in my stomach?"  And he's like, "Yeah, I can feel it too! My stomach's all like whew-whew-whew." *pantomimes squishing things with hands*  So yeah. I haven't felt sick yet, so it must have digested itself or whatever.  BUT can you imagine our entire IB class getting sick from (possibly) black-market African kola nuts someone bought off the internet?  We'd have a big IB nap-and-barf day. And maybe we'd get to miss math. Woot for that.
