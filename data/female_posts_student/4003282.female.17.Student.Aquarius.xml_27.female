Things are wonderful and couldn't get any better. I've got awsome friends, my friends are all happy dappy. And I'm finally tanning! WHOO! So exctied. Works awsome. Camps awsome. I'm finally  ME  again.      I worked today. I get paid Saturday. I work Saturday all day. Wow. I'm gonna lose a bunch of weight sweating. Whoaness.      Oh god. This morning I was on my way to school and I see something in the rode. Me and Amy drive closer to it and it's a dog. I wanted to cry. Actually I did. It wasn't a small dog at all. It was like a sharpe. Someone just hit it and left it. How rude. That's just horrible. How can you do that. First off how can you hit an animal period. And then just leave it there to die. In the middle of the rode. Where another car can just sit there and drive right over it. I feel bad for the people that own the dog because it wont ever come home and they'll never know what happed to their lil one.
