You know that I got over that but still you shouldn't make fun of me because I was _ _ _ _ed....I'm going to go bawl my eyes out now until they melt from all that salt water.  Then I'll be blind and no longer see the pain in this world.  This mutated, ugly world.  What has become of it?  Death, death it lurks in every corner.  How can there be hope in this world?  How?  There is no hope at all and we humans make up lies to cover up our faults.  We create small and pointless items to divert our attention.  Why?  Why was I born in this time?  In this era? Then again, I am young.  I have lived a thousand lives but I am still young.  I have seen a hundred tragedies, heard a hundred songs, experienced a hundred joys but I am still young.  Perhaps I have seen the world and twice through these young and inexperienced eyes.  I am still young.  I am still learning and maturing every day.  I learn.  I learn what?  School work.  What is schoolwork?  Something to help numben the pain of the world when I am old.  This is the beginning.  Already, I have experienced so many sadnesses, pains and humiliations.  If this is the beginning, I don't want to see the end.  Because.  The end is what everyone is afraid of.
