I think the only thing that struck me was when someone said, "I've learned that Christians are totally twisting evolution and misunderstand it." I 'd like to know what exactly they're talking about so that I can find out if that's true.  I found that I relate to a lot of what they're talking about, but at the same time I feelthatI see things more clearly than them, although I also do not wish to call myself a Christian. Many of their reasons for leaving Christianity were based on spiritual abuse from other people or misunderstandings of the purpose and interpretations of the Bible (OT mostly). It's quite a struggle is it not? I can't stand people who don't struggle with it. It's not fair that spiritual stuff is so easy for some people and so hard for others.
