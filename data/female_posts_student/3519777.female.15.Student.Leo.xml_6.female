I ended up with a C-... yuch. I'm not going to say that next year I'm going to get honors next year, because I said that last summer and I totally screwed myself over. I'm going to work my hardest. I think one of my main problems was that I procrastinated too much. So next year instead of doing my homework after dinner I'm going to do it soon after I get home from school so it's over and done with. I hope that I'm going to have friends in my classes and during lunch. I dont know what I'd do if I didnt have some of my friends in my lunch wave. Anyway... out of the school subject...           The Saturday after school ended my immediate family and I went up to Milton New Hampshire and rented a cottage along the lake with my cousin Sean, his mom named Gerri and her mom named Rose... confusing enough??? lol. Anyway the first night I guess my aunt and her mom had an argument because supposidly Rose started throwing things at Gerri in fustration because I guess she didnt know that she was going to come up to New Hampshire... she's really old... I mean  REALLY  old. So anyway that next morning they left, still leaving Sean which was good because I no longer had to sleep on a mattress along the dining area. I got their room which was right across from a bathroom but it didnt have a damn shower. So on that trip we went swimming. I got a slight tan, unlike some fat ass people who decide to get a fake tan at a salon instead of getting off their tub of lard... Also we fished and I caught a baby bass, well it was small anyway and a few sun fish and leaves and a branch off a small tree. It is soo gross when you try to get the worm onto the hook because it can bleed and it still moves while it's on the hook. Crawlers are the worst because they bleed and puss everywhere...             So other than that live has been normal. I haven't really done much except I went to Andrea's house to sleep over two days before going to New hampshire.. or the night before that... I dont know... lol.I have basically just chilled out. Oh, and I'm hopefully getting a Samsung flip phone that has a camera built in it or what not. It's like 70$ though, but it's buy one get one free so my mom can get one. So talk to you later.
