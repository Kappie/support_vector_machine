So we got up at 6:30 and went to breakfast at 7:30. It was ok. After that we went swimming for a little while. Callie and Chloe met up with Cody and Corey and hung out with them. They were flirting and we gave them SUUUCH a hard time. We kept yelling out hand check. *haha, jordan* Then we had a church service and Steve spoke. It was an interesting message. Then we went swimming again... im kinda backwards, i think... but oh well. Then we went to lunch and then went swimming and went to the beach. Where me and a bunch of other people talked to other random people. After that we chlledin our rooms and Callie and Chloe and Casey danced and we laughed and ate M Then we went to dinner and sang christmas songs and VBS songs. We had soo much fun. At first we (me chelsea and lauren) embarrassed drew and amber and hannah, but after a while, they joined in. It was awesome. Then we went back and I put on a secret (haha lauren and chelsea) and we bought our tickets to Miracle Strip. I was feeling bad because, well, i dont really know. But we got there and we were loud and laughed and I overcame my fear of ferris wheels and got on one. Then we rode the acrophobia ride 2. Then we were talkin to this guy named Daniel. He was pretty cool. He rode rides with us. It was about time to go and we got in line at the Shockwave, kinda like the Looping Starship at Six Flags, and we were on and strapped in and we had to get off so they could clean up where someone had thrown up. *EEEEEEWWWWW* Then I gave him my phone number and we left to go back to Laguna Beach. They shaving creamed Jordan and I found Drew and we talked. Then me and Drew talked to Greg about something that happened a couple weeks ago. Then everyone went off to bed. And that concludes Sunday. I'll write about Monday a little later on. RIght now I have to get ready for church.
