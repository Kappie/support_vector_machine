Corroding from inside?  Hard breading Alone Let myself go Beg for the near end No longer I can take Blind my eyes Blind my mind Rip my heart Cut my veins Warm blood flooding Corroding from inside  Smell the end… Let myself go To a better place? Paying for my sins Crouching Corroding from inside The end is near  No more misery  -“What a tragedy…”  Shocked? Fuck you all! My time as arrived Corroding from inside  I don’t regret a thing I would do it again Over and over...
