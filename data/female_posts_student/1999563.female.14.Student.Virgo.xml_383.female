So you have the burger combo with fries. Now here is how you make it taste SO STINKING GOOD, you stuff the fries into the burger! YUM! The things you learn in Romainia... ;)  YUM!  I LOVE IT!!  Today I went to guitar. AND I went to the mall! Hahha. I saw a girl from my tennis team! Her name is Kelsey. She is super duper cool! :)  I tried ona  bunch of glassses and I found these SUPER COOLL sunglasses I migght get without perscription. They make me look like a  rock star. :)  I also found the coolest jeans ever at nordstrom. I might get them. I also saw these Le Tigre shirts which were pretty cool but I think I am going to get a Lacoste shirt off of Ebay instead :)  Yup!  I get my hair cut in THREE DAYS!   I am SO excited, but kinda scared at the same time!  I am off to do random things..haha   haha. I don't know what is funny, but hahha!   I say tomatoe so screw you!!! (Hhahah. inside joke. Mehehehehhe)  Laura
