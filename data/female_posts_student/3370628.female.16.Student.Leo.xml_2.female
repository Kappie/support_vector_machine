Had I awakened this morning in sound health, I would have cheerfully gone to school for a day of sleeping in Drama, bass playing in Music, presentation watching in Soc, and reading in English. But, no, when I woke up my stomach was a big mass of nauseous cramps, so I stayed home. By the time I got up around noon, it was fine, except for being a little hungry. Which I knew would happen, but I stayed home anyway because I figured that, given the aforementioned outline of the day, it wouldn't hurt too bad to just stay home and get caught up on sleep.  I dunno, heh. I started this because I felt like I needed to rant, but all of my energy has already more or less been spent on the subject with Taylor and slightly DL. I was just a little pissed off about fifteen minutes ago because I had my mom on my back about doing chores and things to make up for "not doing anything" today. Pardon me, but it wasn't like I  planned  to be sick this morning. I was actually considering going, just for more lessons with the bass.  So, on top of my general irritation with that, I sign back into AIM after playing  Sacred  with my brother for a few hours to find that Anna is pissed off at DL for no reason. I sighed at her for taking random anger out on DL (a.k.a. innocent bystander), so she got pissed off at me, and I just logged out of AIM again. I can still talk to most of those who were on AIM on MSN, anyway. I didn't need her pissing me off all over again, heh.  Wow. That all really sounds quite pathetic, doesn't it. I blame PMS. -_-'  P.S. I did manage to get that song downloaded that was being a pain last night, with help from my brother. Taylor's sister actually had it, but the quality wasn't that great, so Allan got me another one. Which still isn't of highest quality. Bah. Recording industries just really don't want you to have that song, I guess...
