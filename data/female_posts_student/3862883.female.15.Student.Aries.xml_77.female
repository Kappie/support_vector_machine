The Thames sea was described as being welded together with the sea and the sky. It was also described very eerily and dark. This was a very busy river where many ships took off from. The Thames river played a main role in the road of trade. But many ships that took off never found its was back to the landing site. "What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth?...The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires." (8) I think this means that everyone who rafted down the Thames river had a part of them taken away.
