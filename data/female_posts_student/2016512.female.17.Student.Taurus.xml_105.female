It was delicious. I should buy more mangos. I'm sure they are very good for you. They are like a peach, but with a better smell and a tougher skin.   i've decided i will be running alone from now on. i like it a lot better than running with someone else. all i need is my crappy radio and a trail. there isn't much competition when you run by yourself, just your own will power. i consider running a forceful aggression towards yourself and me being a massacist makes this work. i love it! running till it kills and then not walking for very long *repeat for further enjoyment*  so my future is on the brink. what colleges should i visit on my trip? what the hell should i think about pursuing? when am i going to practice speed reading and my piano song? *shit* should i join v-ball? why do i put up with crap?
