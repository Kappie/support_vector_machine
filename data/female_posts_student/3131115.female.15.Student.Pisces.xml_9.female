My heart has been torn and hope slain Memories haunt and torture, energy drain Carried guilt, too far down one lane Blazing sun, dry weather, but no rain  Lay down, sudden desire for rest rising and falling in a pattern does my breast fallen weakly onto the hills high crest what i wouldnt give for one last simple jest at last the sky turns a darkish gray struggling to breathe, dehydrated all day thunder showers replace the sun, faded away take the blade out of the bag, its time to play waiting my whole life, now i can finally cry i cut my wrist for every time someone would lie for all the hellos, and for all the goodbyes my blood now washed downhill by the rain in the sky as I smile my first real smile, I'm ready to die.   Welp..anyhow, leaving now.    The Bull Shit Will Be Over In A Minute.
