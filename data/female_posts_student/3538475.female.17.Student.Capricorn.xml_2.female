I get the feeling even if I did try fix things again there would be no point in it anyway because it looks like minds have been made up and a get-out-clause is being searched for.  But then hey, I dunno.....could be getting the wrong end of the stick....I could actually be the one making everything worse by trying to be civil and adult and looking for a light at the end of the tunnel.  On a brighter note, Jemma gave me a lift home today, I deffinately want to start driving soon, I'm getting impatient.  Am home alone atm, dunno where everybody has gone...:S  I am also bored....  I think I should try untangle my necklace....but I dunno if there is any point...I don't even think either of us are wearing them atm  ah well more updates on my 'interesting' life later
