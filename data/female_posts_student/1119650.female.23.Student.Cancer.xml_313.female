Last night I tried to go to bed at 10 pm, because I legitimately felt tired, however, paxil decided that for my body, this wasn't going to happen until  3 fucking AM this morning  when I had to be up at 6:15 to get ready for work.  The sleep I got was decent and I'm not  that  tired this morning, but I know if this keeps up all week its gonna get bad.  Furthermore, not being able to fall asleep stresses me out and makes me feel pressured and I start gettign all panicky, which is exactly what the paxil is supposed to prevent.  No sir, I don't like it.  All you late night IM-ers might have a new buddy though if this keeps up.  Feh!  Oh yeah and as for the  urlLink "Boz's Labor Day Weightloss Challenge"  I, much like  urlLink Anna , have lost 4 lbs already.   Only 16 more to go.  Think I can do it?  We'll see!
