(it was the first time ive talked to her since ive gotten here so we both cried.. it was kikinda pathetic but it was awesome to here her voice. soon matt left and i cried again, as he was the last american friend i had made to leave. i know.. pathetic.... we sat and waited for the rest of the family to arrive and when they did (after all the hugging and hello-ing) we headed to our hotel--which is very nice... we went to the square for dinner to celebrate pop joe's birthday then headed back to the hotel for the night....  sunday..... today was the day that we drove to grybow to try to find some remnants of our family. we looked through church records but to no avvail. after seeing to pretty ltiilt town for a while, we headed back to stary sacz again. we met my friand helena, natalia, and ewalyna anfd her fiancee at the wine bar and after some beer with juice, we showed the feruts around the city. they seemed to like the place and i had one more chance to go back to my favorite lody shop. we then went out to rytro to meet my host family. either there was a misunderstanding or who know what but the family had prepared dinner for us, but they werent prepared for quite this many people. they graciously delt with it tho, and fed us all a very nice meal, after some talking and some final goodbyes, we headed back to stary sacz again so i could see helena one last time. there were some interesting adventures and i cried(the third or forth time that day) as we left stary sacz for the last time........  monday... not much to say for now, as its anoly ten in the morning, but the cousins and i plan on doing some shopping while others check out some sites. the time with the family has alreadt been a blast and the cousins and i are already planning another trip for two years from now....... ... this internet cafe is close to the hotel so ill try to update on wednesday (tommorow we will spend the day in zacopane).. talk to you later...MUCH LOVE!!  ****mary****
