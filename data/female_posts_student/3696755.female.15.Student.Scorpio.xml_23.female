Him even liking me is way more than i ever expected to come outta this and for him to not only like me but to have all this other stuff, its great. So what if were not goin out (yet) its just a title. I mean its not like wed like eachother differently just becasue he was my "boy friend". I like what weve got. I like it a lot. I like being able just to lie together all tangled up for hours and just talk and be together. I like likeing him and i like that he likes me. And Its not a big deal if were not going out. All in good time. School starts in 3 days and then well see eachother a lot more and things will turn out just fine, i know it. Things are super. :-)
