Calling out my name.  What I really want is to see you standing there. Arms wide open. Wating for my hug.  What I really want is to be away from you. And know that you miss me. And miss you too.  What I really want is for you to see me. And know that you want to be with me. And wait for me.  But out of all these things. The thing I really want. Is to be able to see you. And for you to see me too. And to be able be over you. Thats what i really want to do. Is be over you!
