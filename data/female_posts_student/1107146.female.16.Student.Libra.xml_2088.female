Oh, and I learned how to peel an apple correctly.  Apparently I've been doing it wrong all along so my mommy had to teach me to do it right.  It takes me about 5 minutes my way.  It took me 18 her way.  But I got to eat it, so it's all good.  With peanut butter too, yum.  What the hell am I smoking?  I just went back and read what I just wrote.  Wow.
