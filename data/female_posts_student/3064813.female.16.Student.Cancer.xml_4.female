Ehhhh whatever.  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  I found out what torpid means!!!!  I feel much more intelligent than I did three seconds ago.  I felt bad because TYLER was LAUGHING at me because I didn't know....  I really need to start reading again.  My vocabulary is DYING.  Like an old person.  And that sucks. Hmmmm what else do I have to say?  I dunno.  I just wrote a 16 page letter to a friend in Boise.  How mad is that?  I really need a life. .... Texans are weird.  All of them.  I have not met a sane one yet, and it's CRAZY.  I don't know what to do with them.  I suppose I'll join their happy insanity eventually, but until then I will stare at them nervously and hope to god that they don't attack me.  Crazy, crazy people, all of them.  I don't think I have anything else to write right now, so I'll leave you with some mad lyrics!!!  "I was in my lab, creating what I thought would be, well, something great for the world.  A two headed cat!  You could pet one kitty’s head while you pet the other kitty’s head….  But little did I know that atomic energy would turn this cat into a man-eating monster!  The cat with two heads, whooooaaaaa, whooooaaaaaa, the cat with two heads!"  Love, Lily
