I mean, no one really knows about this blog except me. At least, not from washington. So, I can be completely open to all subjects.   Tonight, I thought of a new theory. It actually occurred to me previously, but i never thought in depth about it.  I believe that every man and woman is one of 2 types of people. A person seeking love. or A person seeking knowledge. Now, you can have both... and to a certain point, need both. But i think if you have supreme knowledge you can survive without love, and vice versa. But i guess i will never know, seeing how it may very well be impossible to reach either extreme. I guess it's just a wild theory  I'm tired
