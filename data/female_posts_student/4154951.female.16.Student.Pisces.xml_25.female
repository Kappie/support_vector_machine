I'm kinda upset because Ngaiire didn't get through to the next round of Australian Idol.. but it's cool 'cause she'll probably come back for the Wildcard show... =oD      OMG I nearly finished a whole block of Hazelnut Cadbury.. But that's good- it'll bring me closer to 50kilos... 4 more kilos! I hate being 46kilos so much... And my weight is never constant.. Nyehhh.       I have like, 3 assessments.. Religion, Info Processes Tech and Society  Culture... GRRREAT.      For Religion, it's comparing and contrasting bloody religions  again ..just like the last assessment we got. Honestly, where's the variety in things?     For IPT, we have to advertise something (yes I told you about that in my last post)      And for SC, we gotta compare Vietnam and Australia.  FUN.        The OC's on tomorrow, yay! Adam Brody...spankworthy and spunkilicious. =o9  I dunno, Ben McKenzie (is that his name? Y'know who I mean- the guy who plays Ryan) just doesn't do anything for me... =oP  Especially with that stupid sideways face thing he does! Honestly! Take a drink each time he does it in one episode, and you're drunk by the end. Along with Summer's EWs... And all the bikinis at the parties... And Jimmy Cooper's sighs... I love The OC drinking game! LOL... but no, I don't consume any alcohol, and I doubt I ever will. (There's a useless fact for ya.)      Useless Camille Fact #284:  I always fall for the wrong guys.
