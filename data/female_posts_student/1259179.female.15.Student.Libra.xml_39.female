I still walk ALMOST everyday and feel absolutly guilty when I don't.  My operation was pushed back until the 22 of Octobre.  I am a bit relieved. I have more time to do all the things on my list.  My next big task : cleaning all my christmas decorations so it can be ready for me at the begenning of November.  I miss my mom...she is getting back on September 17th from her 34 day cruise to Russia.  So this ~Hump Day~ have fun and...............Be Good
