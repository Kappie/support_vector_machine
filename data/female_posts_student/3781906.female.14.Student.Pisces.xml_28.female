I'm living here for the next week... a little less... I don't remember.  I'm working on saving grace at the same time. The more I write, the more I realise that I am basing my characters on people I know. Hey! If I don't say who they are, it will keep you all guessing!  I'll post more a little later! I've got all day!  ambsy loo
