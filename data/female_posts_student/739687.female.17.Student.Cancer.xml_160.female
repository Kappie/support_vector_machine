I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's almost a little scary. I think it'll work out alright though.  Have you ever known someone who you didn't really talk to much...you know, maybe a 'hi' every once in a while....and you never really thought much about them, but all of a sudden you find yourself thinking about them? And all of a sudden, you find yourself almost being attracted to them. Just out of nowhere...nothing to spur it...nothing changing between the two of you...but all of sudden you're like...strangely attracted to them. I think it's weird. Something just all of a sudden makes you think differently about them. Very peculiar. And it's not like a  strong  attraction either...you just find yourself thinking about them a bit more.  And then there are the situations, which conveniently arise at the same time, where you start to think about people from the past. And you kinda start missing that. But, I mean, everyone reminisces once in a while...it's just kinda sad to miss all the good things that used to be in your life. And, now, I'm not really speaking of people, but of memories in general. Sometimes I just miss the way things used to be. But I guess moving on is part of life.  Well, I'm outta here. See you at the end of the world, crazies.
