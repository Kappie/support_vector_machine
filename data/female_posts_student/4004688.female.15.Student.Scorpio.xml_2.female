(like i was in sec 1) ill start workin this summer etc. i mean, this year is the year of no limits! its my year! thats what i've decided.  its time to pump up my self confidence, pump up my music and drive myself a style; "bref'' be who i wanna be. no more being influenced. no more pretendin, no more hating myself, no more following rules (well alright ill still follow rules). this year i am all smiles, it is the year of change haha!  i mean i've been in a shell since i was a kid, never wanting to bother anybody, never wanting to get on the wrong side of someone, always making compromises and contradiciting myself> hopefully that'll change, cuz i want it to. for sure it'll take time. but this year im figuring out who i am and was meant to be.  seriously, how many ppl in high school act as though living is torture? well as far as i know, alot. i mean ya, its hard, ya u sometimes just wanna chuck evrything down the drain and forget it. ah well, tears are part of living and feeling arent they? where would we all be if none of us could cry or feel sad or guilty? we'd all have turned murderers by now. and tip to the guys; what the hell is it with keeping everything inside?!?!?!? u'll explode! i know this is an extreme example but seriously, u know why there are more male killers out there? cuz they keep all the stuff inside ur head, in any case thats wat i think, some poor man gone crazy with all the pressure and the stress and the sadness that he kept inside that he goes and kills his wife and kids. i told u it was an extreme example but its true.  so i wanna change. cool. and good. change is good. in some cases. i think i was always afraid of change, i like routine but routine becomes boring after a while and henceforth change needs to happen. i dont like surprises, well not the ones where someone goes hey i have a surprise for you and tells u they wont tell u wat is it and itll be like next week, thats annoying. but i think everybody needs to be surprised once in a while especially if they're feeling down; a nice little surprise from their friends nothing big like a chocolate bar or a flower (one u picked urself) or even just saying how much ppl care about them.   so i dunno if any of this is good advice, but to me it sounds like thats how u gotta live ur life. tho the problem is if i can sometimes say smart things and give advice, i cant take it. ''do wat i say not wat i do'' i guess i need to change that as well.  and the sad part is that all i said right here i will most likely forget and go back to my old self, lol but i will remember one day. lol and theres always a possibility that i wont forget and will lead a better life...i'll see once i get there.  summers nearly over! so everybody make the last summer days nice and sweet!
