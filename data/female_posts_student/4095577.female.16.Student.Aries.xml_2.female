I'm sleeping quite soundly in class after school n suddenly na came n wake me up. she asked me to help her to carry the phy bks down. Though deep in my heart i was abit relunctant as why was she calling me as i was sleeping at that time. She could ask other ppl to help her instead. But i still woke up anyway n asked her to wait 1st coz i wanted to go to the toilet 1st. When i came back i saw her walk out of the class carrying all the bks by herself. I thought she was angry even though after that she said she didnt. i guessed somehow when i woke up that time my face don looked very gd then she was not very happy abt it though she said she was tired. Afterall it's history so let it be then. well, i have some thoughts when this happened. i want to be a fren that will really help ppl when they need me, whole-heartedly. not help them but grumble here n there. i tried to change, persuade myself but it doesnt seem to be very successful. but then i'll still try my best. treat this as a little lesson to learn. so what if na said she can manage herself?? being her fren n knowing that she was sick at that time, i should help her to carry when she walked out no matter she angry or not. haiz... 'main zi wen ti'... it's gd to say things more openly when no one will look at this entry. that's the end of today's entry. mata ne!!! Love A.J
