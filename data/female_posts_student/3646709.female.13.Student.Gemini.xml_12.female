Anyway, then we went home.. then me and my sister waited @ the Woodrow clinic thingy for 3 hours to get our physical, man that sucked. Then I came back home and I am being bored. I can't get online cause I'm grounded, but I can be on the internet. Anyway.. Hopefully I will be ungrounded by Tuesday. YAY! I am going back-to-school shopping on sunday! That's going to be SO fun! Well.. I miss seing everyone (even though I saw Amanda today @ Long). I wish I could go over there and hang out.. and get online, BUT I can't. Whoa.. this really sucks. So if you want to "IM" me then we have to E-mail back and forth. Hah.. for these days I have to use E-mail (emiline6692@yahoo.com) to "IM". Well.. I gotta go. I am SUPER bored.. and I don't know what else to say. I will be writing later! adios!
