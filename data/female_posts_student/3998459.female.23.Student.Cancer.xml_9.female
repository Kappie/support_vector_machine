OK, so I know I left IL like three weeks ago, and I should have posted this like the day after it happened but, I didn't. So, deal.  As far as show value Jimmy Buffet wins hands down, but for venue: K.D. Lang at Ravinia Park. The place is AMAZING! Ravinia Park is, as it sounds, a park, except it's built around a large ampatheater. Also, adding to the unique quainess to the show, is that people treat going to a concert at Ravinia like a day at Ascot. Crowds show up in droves hours early, so that they can setup their elaborate picknics. People actually bring candelabra and table cloth-covered wagons come table and fine wines and foods and, coolest of all, some even bring chandelars to through over the baughs of the trees. It's an amazing experience!    I didn't get a great shot of the stage or the park (I'm a smart cookie), so here's a cute one of Maggie and I!  Maggie, her friends Aaron and Etson, and I went to the show together. We brought goat cheese and water crackers, stuff for sandiches, a very good Brie-wrapped-with-pastry-sheets-and-brown-sugar-thing that Maggie made, some non-acoholic Cabernet Sauvignon (long story, but someone won't be celebrating anytime soon), and I don't know what all, oh yeah, grapes, really good green grapes. Etson ate most of them...  After we ate and listened to the concert for a while, Maggie and I decided to walk around and look at all the scenery. Aaron was studying for something so we left him and Etson, who was still eating, to their own devices.    Aaron studying at Ravinia...  We walked among the gay and lesbian couples, K.D. Lang is a fairly proud lesbian, so political as well as musical supporters came to the show, looking at all the really well decorated tables surrounded entirly by men. Lesbians lose points for decor, sorry, but it's true. Anyway, we walked through the park and it was the most amazing movie moment of my life so far. Ms. Lang was singing a Tony Bennett cover, the sun was about to set, and the twinkle lights in the trees were on. Maggie and I danced under a very large shade tree, and it was REALLY romantic.  Anyway, we had a great time!
