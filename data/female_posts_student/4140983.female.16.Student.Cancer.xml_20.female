Mr. Beall likes me, he makes us coffee in class as long as we bring a pound in. He said nothing flavored, because then ALL the coffee smells like raspberry or whatever for a week, but I'm bringing flavored creamer. I'm a wimp, what can I say? I wrote "a pound of coffee" on my school supplies list and my mom cracked up. She thought I was joking. She's like, "Do you want me to make you coffee in the mornings now?" Ha, no. I'm a social drinker. I can quit whenever I want.  TPC with Creekmore is going to be evil. She just got out of teaching 10 year olds. So she treats us like ten year olds. She sent us home with a note for our mommies to sign. And she's incorporating Step Up to Writing by using highlighters? Step Up to Writing is such a waste anyway. It's a middle school program that doesn't even work there. It's formulaic writing, and while it's OK to a certain extent...they just go against all bounds of common decency. It's to teach people how to write essays, very, very basically. But I'm beyond it. They're taking me back, bringing me down. Anyway, one of Ms. Creekmore's rules is: Be Innocent.  I LOVE MS. ROBERTS. She talks like a debutante from the 60's, and she likes talking about literature. Even if she is obsessed with grammar, I still like her. Good thing, because I have two classes with her. Rebecca, Rachel, and I are the three new ACE girls. I have to pick a half.  First half: Vocabulary, Shakespeare, literature, current events, US history, US government, geography. Second half: Mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, art history, world history, sports.  I want to do first half, but so does EVERYONE else. However, world history is my best subject, and I want to study art history, that sounds like a great topic to have. But all second-halfers have to be OK with math. I can do math. I can memorize formulas. I'm not motivated in math class to do well, so I don't. That's better than blaming on myself anyway. I ENJOY math, but I'm not good at it. All first-half people have to do vocabulary, which I excell at.  Physics will be a joke.  Lunch was awesome, Monica, Jenny, Chris, Joe, Jessica, Steven...we all stood in the middle of the hall. Monica wore balls today. She keeps saying it would be fun to go goth, I agree. I mean, it's something to do. She can carry it off, though. I look awesome in black, but I can't do the jewelry or...well, I think I'm just too ditzy to do it. We were badasses this morning, we had a little sermon du jour from the principal in the gym, and instead of sitting on one of the bleachers, we sat in the little foot space. When he said, "And be nice to the freshmen, you were all freshmen once", Jenny said, "Actually, I was hatched from an egg." It was great fun, we made little snarky comments for the next thirty minutes.  Mr. Ed Gay (yes, that is his real name) pulled me aside after choir and asked me if I was somebody he could trust to confide in. He asked me about some people in class and to be perfectly honest, there's only one person in the class I wouldn't sell out. I don't care about most of them and seriously dislike three of them. But I asked him about regionals. In order to take choir, here's what I'm missing out on: AP Bio, Politics and Government, AP European History, creative writing, and journalism, and I told him that. I'm not ready to give up choir yet, it's very important to me.  ACE is going to be great this year, it's quite a bit of reading and studying, but nothing none of us didn't sign up for. Joseph Keck, had he stayed, would have been in all my classes but Choir and Band. It's really quite sad, I'll miss him. I wish I had his email, I should talk to Miranda tomorrow.  I saw Miranda in the halls during lunch, she had Starbursts and was unwrapped them with her tongue. I could do that at the height of my Starburst wrapper days, but sadly, I have lost my skills.  We need a journal for English, I'm either collaging it with lips or eyes. I NORMALLY hate collage, unless it has a cohesive theme, or is beautiful. Regular "stuff I like people I know" collage is incredibly stupid unless done extremely well.  There are tons more stories, but I need to get started on my notebook.
