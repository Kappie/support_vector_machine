If someone disagrees with the surgery - Why the hell do they feel the need to let me know? Not only is it rude but also shows they don't care about my feelings or my health.  This surgery, by no means is an 'easy way out' has so many people like to think.  I guess getting a 14 inch cut down the middle of my stomach and then having a hole were the drain bag was for a week is such a great thing.  Oh and lets not forget the IV's that put a small hole in my neck and left an icky scar.  Oh and my favorite part was being put in ICU for 2 days because my blood level went so low that I almost needed a blood transfusion.  My other favorite part is where the nurses came in and pretty much put a lot of pressure on my stomach while making me cough -- That felt SO wonderful and again such an 'easy way out'.  Now that isn't even the tip of the ice burg.  I never said anything about what I had to go through BEFORE surgery or AFTER.  I never once bitched to anyone about the pain I was in, the fact I can't eat my favorite foods, or hell so many other things.  So to sit there and fucking tell me that you disagree with the surgery, when apparently it shows you don't know shit about this surgery other then the fact you know someone that died.  But guess what? Someone can die during many different surgeries, not just this one. And you know what else? Staying fat isn't fucking healthy either, obesity is a HIGH risk of death whether you want to believe it or not.   So with that being said -  SHUT THE HELL UP!  If you disagree with the surgery or don't want to support my decision to save my life or you just want to be negative about any of this -- Please stop talking to me, IM'ing me, or whatever because I don't need to hear it nor do I want to.
