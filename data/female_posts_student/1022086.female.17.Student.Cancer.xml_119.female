When things like these happen between the two of us, exceedingly venomous things always seem to come out, and today the traditional- if not worse- moral-bashing occurred.  This seems to be happening a lot lately; as odd as this may sound, I really do think that it's time for her to move out and the two of us to part ways for a while. Sometimes I wonder whether it could be possible that there ever exist a feud so huge between us that we may not speak to one another for months or years or decades. It's kind of frightful how I can imagine that happening.  I love my sister, mind you, but what she said today hurt because it was true, and the truth hurts. I, of course, returned the favour. Pointing out each other's weaknesses to this extent makes it worthy of description involving "fire", "missiles", and "severe, disgusting wounds"...   Nonetheless, she verbally confirmed some things I've been thinking about and fearing, so that's sort of yucky. I wonder whether I did the same for her.  We almost always fight so badly the day before any important exams of mine... coincidence? Well, one question's answered: where will I sleep tonight? Not on the floor in my sister's room. That leaves the couch or a pain-in-the-bum transportation of the bed to somewhere else. We'll see.
