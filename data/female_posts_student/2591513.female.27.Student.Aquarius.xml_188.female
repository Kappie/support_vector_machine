LOL  Not very many people read this, thank GOD, but the few that do know me pretty well...for the most part.  I got some good news, Ed will be home tomorrow.  I am excited becaue I don't like when he is gone, it just feels so weird.  I have been productive though, taking care of my college stuff.  I wish I would have just finished my degree at UCSC, but my ass didn't feel comfortable there...my friends were into their own thing (sorority) and getting a place of their own leaving me with no future roommate and hardly ever there...so the only friends I made there were my roomie and the crazy pinay chick on the first floor...aka Trisha.  So here I am, almost 10 years later still trying to finish college.  In my defense, I have been trying to raise three kids and go to school full time while battling health issues, so I know I am doing what I can...it is just frustrating.  I thought I would be done with the JC by the end of SPring, only to find out the requirements for my major have changed, so I have a BUTT TON of classes to take.  Long story short, in this past week I lost my two scholarships because apparently my college put me up for scholarships that require you to be at a four year...dumbasses...I don't even have enough to transfer...DUH!   So there goes $1300...I was told, "Honey, at least you know you could get scholarships."  Thanks, but I needed the money.  So anyway, I have decided to continue my JC education at another school closer to home to save on gas (school was about 50 miles away) and well to be closer to home.  So that makes it my decision to pull Bailey out of St. Mary's (okay so I don't really have a choice in that, he is on a waiting list) and Bailey and Nalani will be at the same school.  Nalani will be going full day on Tuesday and Thursday.  I think it will be good for them.  If I don't like the schools, I will have to option of putting them in another one when I transfer to CSUSM.  Please pray I stay healthy this year so that I can finish at the JC level and move on to the Cal State level.  I really am itchin' to get that degree.  It is more the fact that I want to contribute to the family finances that doesn't require me to work retail, odd hours and well not that well paying.  I need something secure and that will prevent us from living from paycheck to paycheck.  You know what I mean?  Anyway, that was my week in a nutshell...uneventful, huh?  Well I don't know what else to say at this point, maybe I will blog later.  I am going to look through my schedule.  Yes I am taking 19 frickin' units.  God Bless me.  Please just let me get through this.
