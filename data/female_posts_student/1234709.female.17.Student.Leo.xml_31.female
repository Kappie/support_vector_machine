Or having such a selfish father that doing that something drastic seems pretty logical at this point? Maybe it's just me, but after having my Learner's license for a year and still not being able to confidently drive on my own, I feel like screaming. I can't stand feeling like I'm always second to what my father wants. A prime example would be today: yesterday I was promised a driving lesson, but tonight when my dad came home, he talked about him golfing after work. When I asked him if we could go driving, he mentioned having a migraine all day and now that he's home, he just wants to relax. I'd undestand him wanting to relax if he hadn't gone golfing; but it's just rediculous at this point. Not only do I feel like he's got no trust in me, but it's like he doesn't care at all about me.   It'd be so much easier if I could just confront him about it, but everytime I've tried to do so, it just ends up with him yelling at me, and me bawling. As calm and collected as I try to be, he just seems to blow it out of porportion. I wish I could make him see how he treats me sometimes. I don't even think my mom understands it fully, otherwise she would have had a hand in ages ago. Wouldn't it have been easier to get it over with last year? Wouldn't it be easier to just let me go out and be able to do my own thing? I hate being chauffered around all the time. I hate it so much. And asking for rides places all the time, it must get annoying.  This entry wasn't worth the time it took typing it out. I could have said, "My father's a fucking selfish asshole." It means the same thing anyhow. Somehow I think Fraser will be driving before I will. And he only got his learner's a couple months ago. We both agreed he won't be liable to get his Class 5 until he's like, forty. Fraser, where are you? Spending time with you is what usually gets me through the day; I need your company right now. You make me smile.
