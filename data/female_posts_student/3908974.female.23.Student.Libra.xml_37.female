I am strangely excited about our big road trip, although there's so much drama surrounding it that our plans might go up in smoke in the next three weeks or so.  I want to write about this more, but I think I will just wait to see what happens in the interim.  Spent the evening sleeping, the morning just sucking down motor oil coffee and bumming around in my bathing suit.  I fell asleep after swimming yesterday, just crashed right out with a book on my face.  My phone rang all night in the blankets next to me but I never woke up enough to answer it.  So much for my exciting Friday night!  I feel like listening to rock and roll and going to the lake.  I feel like sunshine and dandelion wine.  Last night I dreamed I was building a sandcastle.  (And so castles made of sand...melt into the sea...eventually...)  Lately I wonder what I am doing with my days, if I am spending them wisely or just wasting them.  I feel sometimes like I am throwing coins into a fountain.  But then again, I'd really regret it if I spent this time of my life all business.  So I am going to wait until my friend finishes writing a letter and get the hell outside.
