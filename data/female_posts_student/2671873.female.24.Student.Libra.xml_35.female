I started thinking...and I had a great idea for a blog, but then I woke up yesterday still tired and not so grumpy and couldn't remember.  Now its Monday and I still can't remember this great blog topic.  Maybe tonight at work I'll remember.   Lets see I don't know what to say here on this ever so interesting blog.  I had a busy week last week I went to Galway, then was back for 2 days (worked) left for Belfast on Wed and Dublin on Thurs. and returned to Derry for work on Friday.  Whew just talking about it nearly exhausts me.  Life is good here.  I just am working and now starting to begin my dissertation.  I go home in 3 weeks and am quite excited for another journey back to the States, this one thankfully will be longer and more diverse.  I start in Denver to visit the sister.  Then drive to Montana for Hillary's weddng ( urlLink www.hillandmick.com ) then will fly to Seattle and celebrate the big 25 with my friends there.  Then shortly after I hit that mid-20's mark I fly back to Ireland to finish that dissertation and figure out what the future holds for me.   I know this isn't a profound insightful blog, rather an update.  Oh well.  I'm not using my brain today...its on holidays.
