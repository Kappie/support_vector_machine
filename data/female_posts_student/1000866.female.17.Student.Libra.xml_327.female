OK, I need to pack, and I need to go to the store to get a bunch of stuff, and I need to do laundry, big time. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I'm going to go mad. Seriously. It's crazy.   On a brighter note though, today was a lot of fun. Kathryn, Mary Clare, and I went to registration. I got my schedule. I have maybe one class with someone I know. Heh. YaY? But, yeah. After that we went to Olive Garden for lunch. Quite nice, and then we went to this pottery place where you get to paint your own piece. Pretty nifty. Overall, pretty fu day. I got to see Carson which was cool, and I have Satire and Comedy with her. :) YaY!   OK, I really wish I could elaborate more on things, but I need to go figure out what I'm going to do.
