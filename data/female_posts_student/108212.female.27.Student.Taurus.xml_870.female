E.T. was already posted by Pia before.  Tee hee...        urlLink Kevin Mitnick  gets to go surfing again tonight at the  urlLink Screen Savers .  Watch Kevin on Tech TV ( see your cable provider for the channel).  Kevin has not surfed the web since 1995.  It was a deal that he made with the Feds as part of his parole.  For those of you in the black, Kevin was arrested and convicted as a hacker.  He also wrote a  urlLink book  about his life struggle.   Oya, American Idol is back too!  April, did you try out for it?  Will we see you on FOX?  more to come....  NET
