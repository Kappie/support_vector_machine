___I spent a total of 5 days at the beach and it was almost a total nightmare. Monday and Tuesday it rained like hell and there was almost no sun till Wednesday. So the first two days we spent running from the rain, and shopping. We didn't swim at all... Anh and I walked on the beach, but  DAMN  was that water cold as  ICE !!! I also can't believe I spent like $20 the first day… haha. All I know now is that I’ve got 3 jackets for school, a pink “shorty” tube top, the Alicia Keys CD, 3 books, fudge, and gum! Now I have enough jackets to live forever with!! Haha, I’ve been running out of outfits for the hook-up so yea… but anyhow, I don’t think I will go ever go shopping again, now I’m just plain scared of stepping foot in front of the register. Anyhow swimming was loads of fun, especially when Anh is like boy-crazy forever. We’ve been doing nothing but checking out guys and life guards. They are so  DAMN  fine… the tan is off the hook, and the body…  DAMN .  PHYSIQUE  people, the physique could make any girl  worship  it. So yea, Anh and I were checking out guys the whole damn time, and catching waves as our eyes pondered (0.v) But I personally didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I might. It got pretty boring and I was bored. They’re a kind of family that don’t do much, and they only came all the way here to roll onto the beach, but if I went with my family, we would have gone mini-golfing, and done all this fun, cool shit. I was purely bored by the 4th day, but hey I still got loads of contact with all my loved ones (0.v) hehe.

___I think I wasted more time on the phone with Gene then my one family… ooooopps, but it’s all good. I got really scared after  that phone call  but it turns out that everything is just fine. Me and Anh's little lecture on the 2nd or 3rd night really did help me alot. It's so odd how I've always come to think that no one in the world will understand what goes and runs  thisazn chica but it seems that I was very damn wrong. She completely understood everyword that was slipping from my mouth. Anh is a very motivated perosn adn it isn't hard for her to get upset when aomeone unworthy beats her at something. And that's whats me and her talked about for almost what felt like 2 hours. I kept bringing up my personal bitch ass issues, while she kept all my rants stright so even I could understand what I was saying. And by the end, we realized that we made up very good quotes and metaphors ^.^ harhar~ (thxx Anh!!)

___I hope that I can find my motivation to impress the world with my bitch ass chinkess attitude... because that's crazily, all I wish for. I'm not wishing for Bling, them Summer Flings with the guys,just a great impression on the world to remember always. I can't truly promise that I won't get side tracked, but hey life's going to hit you up slow and that's what you got to learn to take it. Nice and slow, so everything can take effect on you so that your future will be everything you wished, wanted, and hoped for it to be...
