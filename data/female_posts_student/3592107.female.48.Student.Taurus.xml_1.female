I took a shower which took me a while so I was late getting out to the car and everybody got mad, but hey what do I care.  Then we got some Krystal sunrisers and headed to work. I helped Tammy do different things which was fun. We headed for home about 4. We stopped by the place to get some stuff for our pool because it is still not clear. Then, we got supper at Westerlin Sizzlin. On the way home I fell asleep. We we got home I finally woke up. When I got out of the car I felt sick at my stomach so I went in the house and layed around for a while. Then I got to feeling better so I ate supper. Then I took another shower for cheerleading practice. WE left for cheerleading practice around 6:45 because it was from 7 till 9. The Jv worked on their cheer and a couple of stunts. Omg it was awesome because we tried some different stunts and they stuck!!! Kendra came over after cheerleading practice and mom, Skylar , Kendra, and me talked for a little while. Then I watched some Law and Order SVU. After Law and Order went off I went and got on the internet and talked to a couple of people. And Skylar was making me mad so I got off the internet and went and took my 3rd shower for the day ! After that I stayd up for about 20 or 30 minutes ... Then I fell asleep.
