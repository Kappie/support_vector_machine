I was describing Kurama's gray hair, not your *eh-hem*   silver   ... locks. I was just saying that there should be an "'c" on the end of "teal". That's all.   Really, captain... Miss V has her full support behind Jack's question. She also wants to warn you about something to do with the liver. (I really was trying not to listen.)  Ooh! Yay! Shoot the glowy-eyed demon! Wait a minute! Shoot the   EVIL   glowy-eyed demon!
