Sad, wired, excited to look pretty tommorow, hungry (now that I think about it), and lonely.   everything negative, I'm not sure why I'm feeling it, and it's not strong, but strong enough to feel. I'm not sad enough to cry, and I'm talking to Mike, so I haven't the faintest why I'm lonely.   I haven't written lately, and that is depressing, I feel like....If i write anything bad about mike and I, it will cause another fight, because his friend's will get on his case.  I don't have a private journal, because ti has never helped me feel better, ever. I dont like the idea, nor have i ever, of "writing the person you are angry with a letter and not sending it." i tried it, and it doesn't work for me. I've written bitterly, mean, compromising, four-letter words only, and none of it helps.   anyway,   jesus loves you, just not in that way.
