Well it's my usual time of writing - almost midnight.  Drove home this evening and only got back at 9.  By the time I had unpacked the car, put my washing on, and said hello to my parents it was already 11pm so I thought since I was still up you could have the pleasure of my company!  Today has been ok.  Had some crap - but am learning to see things more balanced and not discount the positives (like Ruthie saying she loved me- and when that comes from a 2 year old it means SO much - although it could be just because I had made her a bead bracelet!)  so the crap: Well Jon (Rachel's fiancee) phoned me about Spring Harvest next week when I am there as a guest with them and his youth group.  And said "you don't mind do you " that I was going to be put in a chalet with 3 other 17 yr old girls who I totally don't know to look after them and make sure they don't get up to anything they shouldn't.  Well firstly when someone says 'you don't mind do you?' it hardly gives you much space to say anything really - I mean I am not that brave yet to say well actually I do.  And he didn't ask me, or say this is what I'm thinking about, what do you reckon.  It was just this is what I've arranged, thats ok isn't it.  But the problem was I was in the middle of packing the car, and when people spring things on me I can't think fast enough. So of course my usual automatic pilot came on and I said no of course thats fine.  But came off the phone fuming.  I mean its not a totally unreasonable request, except it wasn't a request as such, but it just annoyed me that what I wanted didn't seemed to matter or even be an issue.  I was cross for four reasons mainly: 1. He didn't ask me to be a leader and have responsbility when I signed up. I agreed to going on the basis of I was just going with him and Rachel and it would be time to chill and relax and not be responsible for people after my week with the kiddies. And that he would be responsible for his youth group not me 2. This is my week, which I've paid for, to do the things I want, not to be with some random strangers (is that really selfish?) 3. I don't know these girls at all, and they all know each other, I want to be with someone I know. I haven't seen rachel for over 2 months and probably won't see her for another 2 months. Plus we have some stuff to sort out. 4. I am going to be knackered after my week of kiddies and don't want to share a room with a 17yr old who is probably going to come rolling in at 2am  So anyway I talked to my friend julie about it and said am I being really selfish and unreasonable and she said no, that this was my need and my wants and thats ok to have them.  so I phoned up Jon to explain (normally I would avoid it and email but I didn't today!) unfortunately - or maybe fortunately - I got his answer phone so I left this really long message explaining the above.  I then called rachel to make sure that it wasn't that she didn't want to share, because if she didn't then ok I would have no choice. But she said it wasn't that, it was just that they wanted to have leaders in each chalet to like watch out and chat to the younger people if they had any problems (although I'm not sure if I believe her because she kept going on about how she thought it best if we weren't together).  Now I have NO problem doing this - if this is what I've signed up to do, but I was never asked to do this before.  then she said oh but you only have to sleep there, and I felt myself starting to give way and just say oh ok in order to please and not upset people, but I held firm and kept reiterating that I wasn't asked to do this and I really would like it if I was in the same chalet as her, so long as she was happy with that.  I explained that this was my desire, that this was what I would like, and whilst I understood that you obviously can't always have everything your own way, I really felt that it was important for me to express my wishes.  I explained that I needed to respect myself and my own boundaries and was doing this by saying that I wasn't happy sharing with these other girls. So I held my ground. Felt really horrible about it at first, but was ok. Just hope I'm not being totally unreasonable and selfish. I keep thinking, no I just stood up for my needs and was assertive, but then keep having periods of 'oh my goodness what a bad person I am, how could I possibly be so selfish and demanding'. And I suspect that some of you will read this and think oh my what an awful person but hey I promised I would be open and honest on here.  Jon didn't call me back but he just came online and said that he had picked up my message and understood it and was trying to sort it out.  So yipee I did it!   James does that count as a point? I reckon I should get 10 for that. Oh hang on I haven't explained the points system - will do that tomorrow.  Oh am feeling slightly peckish (apparently you canadians don't use that word, or salopetes, or dungarees - you wierdos!). Maybe a glass of milk and a fairtrade cookie is in order.  I'll blog tomorrow - Katelyn don't kill me - but I won't be blogging for the next 2 weeks because I'll be at Spring Harvest - but promise I'll do an extra huge blog when I get back on the 15th if you want me to. Please think of me with my 300 5-7yr olds - it could be total chaos!
