Then tomorrow I’m sleeping at her house so this is the plan of action : Friday: Scarborough Fair. Friday Night: Sleepover! Saturday: Market. Saturday Night: Sleepover again! Sunday: Be really lazy!! Sunday Night: Sleep at dads. Monday: ???  So I’m gonna have a lot of fun! Right now I’m Sat in my garden with the computer ((I’m not on the Internet I wrote this on Microsoft Word first!!)) Sun Bathing and having a rant about Danielle and Kelly! As you know I fell out with Danielle a while ago, But I fell out with Kelly the day before yesterday ((How am I supposed to know what day it was?!?)) I was sat in my Garden minding my own Business (( Hee hee hee!!)) When Melissa, Kelly’s Sister, Came along and said “Kelly says she doesn’t like you any more because you called her a Bitch!” so I said “And….Maybe I did and that’s only because she called me goofy awhile back!” Melissa then said “Well I think you are goofy and you should leave my sissy alone!” Then I said “Melissa maybe I have big teeth but I can fix them but you cant fix your big head!!!” Well personally I think that’s the best comment I have come up with all month!!!  Any ways got to go,                  Bye x x x
