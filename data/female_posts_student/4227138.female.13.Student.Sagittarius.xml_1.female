I like to learn, then play games that have nothing to do with learning.     Straighten up is the fact that that's what my class needs to do. (according to Mrs. Nelson) We talk too much in line, we're bad at lunch, we talk too much in class. Whatever. It's only the fourth day lady, get over it.    Ah the power of purple. Let's see. Our PE teacher is kinda cute, but evil. He's evil because we have to do drills on Tuesdays. Our drills consist of 36 exercises.. ooooh my. The only time it seems he may not be evil, is on Thursdays. Thursdays we play a game, such as dodgeball, soccer, football (aaah!! I'll probably get trampled..) and basketball, whatever.    Jill can't believe that we're already here in eighth grade and that we've learned so much. Actually, I can't either. It's quite amazing.    ¤~Never under estimate my Jesus~¤
