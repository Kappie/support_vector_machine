So i'm going to drag Sarah to it when she gets back from Inverness. :D She stayed over my house the over day though she didn't sleep as she was getting on a plane a few days later and had to work. We watched loads of Futurama and we both were crying with laugher at some episodes. She is definitly my Futurama buddy. She's so hilarious. She has the same kind of humour as me too (the sarcastic funny type eg. The Emperorâ€™s New Groove) so we both laugh at stuff like that and seeing as Futurama is that sort of type it was great. I wished she could stay for longer but she had to go but i hope she'll want to see it with me. Also she rang me a few minutes before she left for her holiday to say that she would see me when she gets back. She is the coolest. Later that night i saw Shrek 2, so funny. The songs and the jokes. Puss in Boots rocks.   I got a new PS2 game yesterday. You've gotta love Seventh Heaven. It's my local game shop but it has all oldish type games, like i got Shadow of Memories, which you wouldn't have been able to find at one of the bigger stores, *coughGAMEcough*. I also got Shadow Hearts from there, whcih you cannot find anywhere now. I love that shop so much, it's grand and mighty cheap too.  So this game is by Konami, and the begining is when your character, Eike Kusch, is stabbed in the back while walking. Then you meet this weird person (with a creepy voice) who gives you  "his" Digipad through which you can go back in time and change your fate. Although just saving yourself once doesn't work, the hour at which you die changes and you need to find out who your assasin is and take him or her out so you don't die. It's a very good game and runs on real time. Classy.  That's all i got now
