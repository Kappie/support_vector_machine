It's pretty early. Oh, Oh, I can now confindently say that I play more games before 9am than most people play all day. If you want to play with me; just email me. I usually play Medal of Honor from 8:30am to about 10am; I am tevren. If you pefer to play *starcraft* (broodwars or normal) than join channel hses anytime between 11:45am to 1pm; I am IamAEvilMonkey. That's all for now, going to go kill people in MOHAA.
