You should hear it to see the true beauty of it tho, not just read the lyrics....   you bring light in...  (repeated many times)  to a dark place  walking in light  glowing walking in light  gold ring around you  the hues of you  the golden sunlight of you   you bring light in...   cool wind following  following after you  rising for you  your skin beautiful  everything comes natural  fantastic fan  rocking rocking floating   There was a little drawing of a heart next to that, followed by an exclaimation mark. The back of his was covered in stuff... stuff like: Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is sooo nice. And that had the exclaimation thing too. It was just silly crap that hit the spot. And he let himself be drawn in.
