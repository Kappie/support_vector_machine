I think that snakes should be removed from the planet.  They're nasty creatures that have no purpose besides haunting the dreams of countless ophidiophobiacs.  They're evil, disgusting and scary.  I would never, ever, EVER date someone with a snake, or be friends with one.  It's the reason that I can't become a veterinarian, unless I could limit my practice to non-reptiles, besides iguanas and turtles.  Are turtles amphibians or reptiles? Anyway, I loathe snakes.  In the dream, a snake was crawling on our kitchen table, and it wrapped around my hand and bit me.  I chopped off its head, and the tail jumped up and hit me, and then I was sitting on another snake that bit me in the butt.  It really freaked me out.      Unity. You Turly Desire Unity. You wish that the world was together as one, and world peace was among us. You enjoy sitting in natures peaceful spots to get away from war and hate.
