Didnt have a chance to update what with fencing and homework and being in a pretty decent mood...having spent time with emily recently...  yeah. so friday i had fencing set up for the tournament yesterday and i had to go to school at 6:30 (this is friday) to tape strips and carry boxes and arrange reels and plug in reel cords and what not... and i was really tired so as soon as i got home from school at 4:15 or whatever i slept until 6:05ish and then got up and ate a bunch of goldfish and went to set up and came home and looked up T-mobile cell phone plans cause i want a new cell phone and my dad says before i can get a new phone he wants to switch to some new plan so that everyone in my family who has a cell phone (my dad, my mom, me, and soon to be alex) can call each others phones for free...sine thats mostly what i use my cell phone for. then i went to bed at like 11. got up at 6 on saturday to be at school by 7. SHS fencing invitational. Fenced five girls in my pool. lets see... i won 2 lost 3. i figured that wasnt too bad. considering it was forever till i beat anybody last year. well, i beat this one girl 5-0, this other 5-3, then lost 2-5 and 3-5. so i had a -3 indicatior. which is fairly good, right? i dunno, i wasnt too disappointed in myself. i mean, its not great, not really taht good...but its not totally sucky. was automatically in top 32. lost my DE though... however, it was close... i was winning for a while... ended up losing 11-15 which is pretty close. the girl was at least a year older than me, i believe. i dunno. culver. Erin lost to her, so... haha. i think i probably couldve beaten her in a 5 touch bout. but whatever... nobody who actually reads this blog (ha, does anybody?) cares about my fencing stuff anyway. so...i ended up staying at shs until maybe 5:35? then my dad picked me up and i ran home and showered as quick as possible and left with caitlin to go see musical. How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. it was pretty good. some good humor. Pit was cool. a little to long though... or maybe it seemed so because i was so freaking tired. i dunno. didnt go to bed till like 12:30 cause it didnt end till 11:30 and i didnt get home till 12. long day. im sore now from fencing. grrr. It was Pang's birthday yesterday. happy birthday pang. poor jessica...had to spend her birthday fencing and musicaling. and sick. i hope she didnt have a horrible day. Julies birthday too. but she apprently got to go shopping with heather and stuff... probably had more fun than pang. and guess whos birthday it is on tuesday? Emilys! which reminds me i gotta go to the mall today... eh. i wonder if she wants balloons? maybe i should ask. and if im getting her something...do i give it friday or tuesday? hmmm...decissions decissions. i wonder what eric'll do. maybe i should ask? ah, too much to think about. and cards... grr. write a card? did last year... i just wrote her an email... one of those "youre a great friend" emails... seems kinda soon to say all that again. hmmm.... well, ill have to do some sort of card... but then...give it friday or tuesday? hmm... and are we gonna do taht box thing? bah. too much to plan. good news is no fencing for me on tuesday. bad news is its because of sports awards...so shes gotta go to those so i cant spend my free time talking to her. :-( oh well. no fencing is good no matter what.   haha...caitin...(this wasnt our conversation...but something like this) "underwood-grobarek....underarek....underEric! haha, Emily undereric. get it?" ...she laughs... i laugh a little... she continues to laugh... i make a face like *id rather not think about that*. she says something like "well, not really i mean...but...hahaha" and im just like "its not fun to imagine" and shes like "i know, but its funny" and im like "think about it seriously though...just do it. seriously. imagine it" and she kinda stops laughing... "ew, no" and im like "just think them having sex. see it? see it?" and shes like "no, ew, stop." so i did. i think i proved my point though. its probably not the same for her as it is for me though... but maybe it is? shes known her since she was really little... i dunno. very unfun thought though. not until shes married! and...i dunno...i dont feel like thinking about this anymore.  bottle cap. "your dreams will come true"... or was it "your fantasy will come true?" oh well. either way... i wonder if that worked/will work? hope so. deserves it.  "i ask for nothing but that you accept what i give you and know that i am happy in giving it to you." -what is that describing?
