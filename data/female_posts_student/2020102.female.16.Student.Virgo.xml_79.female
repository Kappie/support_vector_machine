Witness: All my autopsies are performed on dead people. Attorney: Do you recall the time that you examined the body? Witness: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m. Attorney: And Mr. Dennington was dead at the time? Witness: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an autopsy. Attorney: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse? Witness: No. Attorney: Did you check for blood pressure? Witness: No. Attorney: Did you check for breathing? Witness: No. Attorney: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy? Witness: No. Attorney: How can you be so sure, Doctor? Witness: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar. Attorney: But could the patient have still been alive nevertheless? Witness: It is possible that he could have been alive and practising law somewhere. -testimony from court records  "Either that girl is flirting with me, or my paranoia is finally trying to do something positive." -Brad Yung, 1998  "They've managed to keep their unemployment low although their overall unemployment is high." -Former President Bill Clinton  "Those who survived the San Fransisco earthquake said, 'Thank God I'm still alive.'
