It is not the strength of our faith, but the perfection of Christ's sacrifice that saves! No feebleness of faith, nor dimness of eye, no trembling of hand can change the efficacy of Christ's blood. The strength of our faith can add nothing to it, nor can the weakness of our faith take anything from Him. Faith (weak or strong) still reads the promise, 'the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.' If at times my eye is so dim that I cannot read these words, through blinding tears or bewildering trials, faith rests itself on the certain knowledge of the fact that THE PROMISE IS THERE, and the blood of Christ remains in all its power and suitableness upon the altar, unchanged and unaffected." -Horatius Bonar  "Whoso loves believes the impossible." -Elizabeth Barrett Browning  "The chief pang of most trials is not so much the actual suffering itself as our own spirit of resistence to it." -Jean Nicholas Grou  "I find doing the will of God leaves me no time for disputing about his plans." -George Macdonald  "There seems to be a notion abroad that if we talk enough and pray enough, revival will set in like a stock market boom or a winning streak on a baseball club. We appear to be waiting for some sweet chariot to swing low and carry us into the Big Rock Candy Mountain of religious experience . . . a kind of benign miracle, a feverish renaissance of religious activity that will come upon us, leaving us morally as we are now, except that we will be a lot happier and there will be a great many more of us...." -A.W. Tozer  "When you resort to shouting in conflict, you are reacting in the flesh. You have lost control of the only person you can control: yourself." -Neil T. Anderson  "The beautiful thing about this adventure called faith is that we can count on Him never to lead us astray." -Chuck Swindoll  "If our greatest need had been information, God would have sent an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent us an economist. But since our greatest need was forgiveness, God sent us a Savior." -Roy Lessin  "It's a good thing to have all the props pulled out from under us occasionally. It gives us some sense of what is rock under our feet, and what is sand." -Madeleine L'Engle  "When was the last time you laughed for the sheer joy of your salvation? People are not attracted to somber doctrines. There is no persuasive power in a gloomy and morbid religion. Let the world see your joy and you won't be able to keep them away. To be filled with God is to be filled with joy."  "This year, or this month, or, more likely, this very day, we have failed to practise ourselves the kind of behaviour we expect from other people." -C.S. Lewis, "The Case For Christianity"  "Everyone feels benevolent if nothing happens to be annoying him at the moment." -C.S. Lewis
