So, you've worn me down folks...I'll give them a go, as I just purchased the first book off Ebay for $0.99.  ************** I really love to use swear words. A fucking BUNCH! Even better, I love to learn random swear words in other languages.  I knew a Lithuanian girl when I studied in Iceland. She taught me a bunch of Lithuanian and Russian curse words. A month later when I went to study in Holland, I found out that another girl in the program was Lithuanian. Immediately, I rushed over to her, and with the biggest grin of pride on my face, I proceeded to show off my knowledge of Lithuanian swear words.  Me: * in Lithuanian * Fuck off!  Lithuanian girl: * in English * Excuse me?  Me: * repeats in Lithuanian * FUCK. OFF.  Lithuanian girl: Oh...um...  Me: * now in English * Oh, sorry...My name is Claire. You're from Lithuania, right? I just wanted to try out some of the Lithuanian curse words I've learned.  In retrospect, I probably would have been wise to introduce myself and given that disclaimer before I started with the barrage of curse words. But sometimes, these things just don't cross my mind...
