And I swear the guy that works there was hittin on us. Then we went to Hot Topic. Those people were the coolest. We talked about Harry Potter and crap, and the cashier lady was like dissin' all the other Hot Topics and then we talked about Harry Potter some more hehe. And they weren't like the creepy ones at our Hot Topic. They didn't have the oddness to them which was awesome. They were like normaler lol. We went through the whole mall like 2 or 3 times. Raided a piano store and played "Bohemian Rhapsody" but then one of the workers was coming towards us so we ran away. Then we went to this Unique Boutique store and there was nobody in there. All of a sudden we're lookin at shirts and the guy that works there was like MR. BUBBLES! *refering to my shirt* He scared us sooo bad. And he was like the weirdest person just watching us as if we're gonna steal somethin. And he kept asking us questions. People can be too nice...fo sho. Then we traveled to Journeys and I was like OMG! Look at the socks! And one of the guys was like so THAT'S why you came in huh? And I was like excuse me, the shoes. They were awesome converse btw. Then we were talkin bout the guy's shirt...Homer Old School. And the chick workin there was reinacting the shot lol. And they complimented our peacock feathers. They were like OMG! Those are sooooo cool! They were so geeky but they were the greatest. So yeah. If you ever go to the STL Mills, go to Hot Topic and Journeys! Tasha, I bought a hott Sirius Black shirt and I thought of you. :) Then I bought a Rocky Horror shirt and my mom was like you've got to be kidding. lol good times good times. When are we goin shoppin again??
