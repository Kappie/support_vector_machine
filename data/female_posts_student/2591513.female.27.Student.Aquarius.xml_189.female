I can't sleep because my dad sabotaged us with bad shrimps...I can't imagine it being anything else.  But who knows, I am no expert, but my stomach hurts like a SOB.  UGH  I can't go to bed it hurts so much...so what do I do...I go on here nad blog...pathetic, I know.  I know I should be sleeping.  I was mad because I had a blog and then it didn't go through.  I hate my computer right now because we are being plagued with the frickin' pop ups and we lose our internet connection every now and then...I HATE LIVING in BFE.  Our cable connection sucks...not to mention our frickin' cell phones...don't get me started on that.  We have been playing MAHJONG.  Fun stuff.  I ahve been playing video games with Bailey too.  I really need to get out, I am gaining weight again.  I haven't tried the SBD that my friend has been raving about (with good reason too, she looks great...not like she didn't look great before...).  Well first of all, I don't think I will do well on this SBD, but also because my dad is here for a few more days and well it would be hard to give up filipino food while he is here.  Anyway, my tummy calls again.  So I think I will lay down for a bit.
