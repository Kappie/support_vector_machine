She spends a long time saving herself and also wanting to 'kill' her rapist. But she really doesn't kill him. He's serving 8-32 (I think) years in prison. I don't understand why anyone would do such a thing. Go pick up some woman in a street corner instead of forcing someone to do it. Geez.   Its almost 1am but I'm not sleepy. I won't get any sleep tonight on account of being on my damn period.
