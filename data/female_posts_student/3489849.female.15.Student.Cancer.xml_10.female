Then i went to night swim with the same people minus steven and earlier in the day i had previously gone to the pool with Christine.  So on top of Hawaii I did even more swimming yesterday!! Ellen is home so today we're prolly gonna hang out and then Bab gets home tomorrow!! :-D It sucks that as soon as i get home she leaves for New Mexico without any warning! Anyway my dad needs the computer for a while now, so... ummm.. Toodles i guess! -Kelz0rz
