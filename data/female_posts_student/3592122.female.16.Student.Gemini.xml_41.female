They are able to look deeply into your eyes...  and lie.  You wanted to be in love  With someone you could trust.  After all, loyalty is a must  When you're in love.  Even when something just doesn't feel right...  And you lie awake, thinking about it all night...  Still...you want so hard to believe  Although the evidence is there.  The day finally comes  When you see the light...  You feel like a fool,   Once you gain new sight  Realizing...  You fell victim  To a web of deceit.     witchbladeXX
