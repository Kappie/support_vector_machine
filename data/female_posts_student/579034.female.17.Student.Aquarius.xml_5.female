And I felt SOOOO terrible when I reread my posts and I found that I had left out Jose!!! First I forget to say goodbye to you and then I leave you out of my blog! How terrible of me! Well, Jose, no one knows the NY Style like you (lol)... ROAD TRIP!! Anway, tonight should be a good time... Greg, Greg, and Melanie are gonna come over and well order a pizza and get a movie or something. So, talk to yous later!XOX
