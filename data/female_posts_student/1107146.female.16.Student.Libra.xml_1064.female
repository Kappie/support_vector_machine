One can only stand getting their brains fried out so many hours and days. The left side of my torso bears testament to that. And my nose. And my feet. And my waistline. And the undersides of both my cook-ed arms. And on and on and on. It was  so  warm on those beaches though, and music sounds a thousand times better there. And it's  WARM .  It was really great until I saw a school bus passing by the resort on the way to the beach one morning, and it ruined my entire life. I broke down in tears on the streetcorner right there, leaking sweat and SPF 30 from my eyes, clutching my burned arms to my chest and drawing them away quickly as it hurt a world of hurt. And of course, this whole story, or as much as I care to tell, in poetic detail on my  urlLink BLog , and as I feel like typing it. I just want to read stuff and sit back and catch up now. TRUST ME, I'm getting my fill of that with all the DI emails and such.   Ciao mes amis, goot (yes, that is a "t") to be back.
