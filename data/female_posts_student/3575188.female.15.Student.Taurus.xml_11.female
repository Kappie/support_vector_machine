Proffesor Umbridge just told Proffesor Trelawney the divination teacher that she wasn't that good of a teacher and that all she was was a fraud which was also what Hermoine thought as well. She told Harry in the 3rd book that Harry that the grim was mad out of his tree leaves for goodness sakes. Anyway, she was really mad about that so she was slaming books and the desks and throwing the books at the students. as you can see no one likes Proffesor Umbridge she is a faul, cruel, mean woman, who doesn't need to be in the same room as any child. Tahnk goodness she doesn't have her own kids. But getting past that. While Harry was in Potions class with Proffesor Snape Proffesor Umbridge was in there inspecting him. I personaly think that seh is trying to ruin Hogwarts reputation. So far she has said that every teacher in Hogwarts doesn't now what they need to be teaching. They are making the students go way over there leages. Anyway, Harry was in a class with the two teachers that he hates most in the school. Snape was having the students do a potion, I don't remember what it was called, but Proffesor Umbridge didn't think that it was suitable for the students at such a "low level of learning," She told Snape that she was going to have it taken out of the syllabus. Of course Snape was trying to stay patiant with Umbridge as she was questioning him. She asked him How many years he has been at Hogwarts, he said 14 years. She asked him if he has been applying to the defense against the Dark Arts position every years since he first applied. He said yes. Umbridge was having trouble figuring out why Dumbador was not giving him the position becasue every year for the past 5 years they have had a different teacher. The potion that Harry was supposed to be prforming didn't exactly work for him becasue he was to wraped up in what Umbridge was saying That his potion almost exploded. Snape say this and Put a Vanquishing spell on Harry's "potion" and told Harry that he had to do a 1 parchment essay on how to do the potion write and what he did wrong and it had to be turned in the next lesson. Of course that just added on to the Homework he already had for Potions so Harry would have to stay up a few for nights to complete all his work. When he got back to the Common room Fred and George, Ron's brothers, where already attrackting a crowd as usual. They were eating chews that one side made throw up and the other stopped you and they found joy in that. Harr was trying very hard to do his essay but was distracted by all the noise. It was midnight when Harry decided that he would put it up for the night. Just then Serius popped into the fire place just like he said he would. Harry found out that he new that Harry was planning on having a Defense class once a week because one of the people at the Hogs Head had over heard them all talking. That wasn't a very good ending but it will do. TAlk to you soon.
