Everyday they tell me it is going to rain, so I carry my umbrella with me, only to make it through the whole day with nary a drop falling from the sky.  Doesn't the Weather Channel know that I've had three umbrellas in the past two weeks, and that every day I carry it with me, I risk losing the present one and having to buy another?  It's a risk I'm willing to take if it is actually going to rain, but if it's not...  As an aside, I'm sure I'd know why I don't have a cause of action against the Weather Channel for misrepresentation if I'd only learned anything in Torts II.  But alas, I did not...  Having said all of that, and even though I did bring my umbrella with me, I'm going to have to go knock on wood, since I don't actually want it to rain.  At least not right now when I am about to depart the building and walk up to Union Turnpike for lunch.  It can rain later, once I'm back inside for the duration of the day.  Okay, enough with the mindless chatter...it's food time.
