I'm outside, hanging lights everywhere for my party, and it gets kinda chilly, I don't think anything of it, then it gets really windy, I start to worry a little, but then I figure it's the Tri-Cities, of course it's gunna be windy, then it's starts to rain. It NEVER rains in the Tri-cities, and now all of a sudden, the weather has decided that on my birthday - wait a second....HECK FREAKIN YEAH!! Now I can have the mud fight I originally wanted to have!!! Oh my gosh! I'm so excited!! YAY FOR RAIN!
