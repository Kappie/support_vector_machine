So my dad's telling us about dropping him off, and talking about the counselors and stuff, and mentioned "she."  I did a double take (well, not really, but wouldn't that look nice in a restaurant?) and was like, "there are FEMALE counselors there?" My father snorted and affirmed this.  They don't allow GAY MEN to work in the Boy Scouts, but WOMEN are okay.  Say WHAAAAAAAAAT?  I'm completely confused. I mean, I thought people were justifying this whole anti-gay-scouting* thing by saying that gay men would either rape the children or display something less than the masculinity desired by the boys.  So in light of that new stuff..... I'm sorry, but how the hell can someone rationalize this? Are they saying women are incapable of raping people? Or that women - actual FEMALES who are actually feminine (and I mean this in the most un-loaded of ways....) - are better suited to teach masculine values than men? Actual masculine(again, the most un-loaded of ways) men, with penises and th4e ability to grow facial hair?  I'm pretty sure anyone can rape ANYONE. At least, that's what they told us in Health class, and those "my body's nobody's body but mine"-type videos.   And by "masculine" and "feminine," I mean "of a man" and "of a woman." Not "rugged and musky" and "flowery and delicate." I read the essay on the English language - I know when to be careful.  But how are they pulling THIS off? Are gay men just evil, evil people or something? Are they just going to come out and SAY that they hate gay people? I mean, it's about time SOMEONE was honest about it.  More likely, they'll continue to rationalize it.    *In the meantime, I think the Gay Scouts would be a cool organization..... find your favorite homosexual and spread the word!
