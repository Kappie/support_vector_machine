I am worried about S. it sounds like Innsbruck might not be happening for her.  Plus here apt flooded over memorial day while she was out of town and she came back to find water, about an inch in her house.  There must be something to the ickiness that is happening.  Penance for prior wrongs or forced appreciation of the good things.  I read immigration today and next chapter is refugee and asylee law.  Sweet. I leave for Rome on Friday.  On another note, I think the St. Thomas people are beginning to dislike the ¨St. Mary´s Girls¨ we have apparently developed a reputation for always doing the reading, and there are even rumors circulating that we´ve already finished the reading in both books.  Not so.  Wishful thinking.  I hope Rome provides a much needed release.  But of course, the books are coming too.  If any family members feel inclined to donate to the Rachel in Rome fund, please feel free to.  Oh, did I mention, I hate law school?
