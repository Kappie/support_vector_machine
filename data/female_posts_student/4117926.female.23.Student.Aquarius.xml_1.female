I get to share a tent with a guy I have never met. He is friends with Sarahs man. She has described him to me, what he looks like and his personality.  I hope hes cute and doesn't smell lol.   Still no man in my life obviously.... I am not too sure if I even really WANT one right now. It would be nice. But I think I would perfer something casual though. I will be very busy in September once school starts back up and I'm working every weekend. Right now I think I would just perfer a little attention. Wether it be physical or verbal. It would be so nice. I get lonely every now and again.   I am really starting to hate this Zellers commecial   Good grief charlie brown!! Just stop calling me! I just got a phone call. I am not naming who. I am sick of people trying to make me feel bad! I am not your bloody pigeon. I do not sit at home just waiting for you to call. I have a life. Its not much right now but it's mine. I am working between 50 and 60 hours a week right now. barely getting a summer to myself. I'm so damn sorry if I haven't talked to you in a week or so.   Quickmill..... :) there is a cute boy working there ;) well 2.... But one I think is very cute and very nice.    I'm going to watch Kill Bill Vol 2.  LUV U!! thanks for reading.... I will write again soon  Peace
