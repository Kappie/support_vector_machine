But not as much concentration as it takes to study for the bar exam.  Not that you could tell this from the state of things in the St. John's Law Library.  Now I understand that the recent law school graduates (and in defense of my school, not all of the students making use of the library to study for the bar are in fact students recently departed from St. John's, as anyone can take the bar review course here and study in the library) may have something less than respect for the rules and regulations governing library conduct.  This is evidenced by the number of cell phones I have heard going off just since I began to type this, not to mention the hurried gathering and chattering amongst fellows.  But even if they aren't interested in taking the rules seriously, or even in being curteous toward their fellow library inhabitants, you'd think that fear of the bar exam would force them to take more interest in studying than in talking incessantly to their significant others on the phone.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, since it is always like this at finals time as well, but I figured that the increase in the difficulty of the exam, not to mention the increase in the seriousness of acheiving a passing score, might just evince a change in the atmosphere around here.   I guess I was wrong.  I can tolerate a certain irreverance for the rules, just as I can tolerate almost anything, so long as it is in moderation.  But people, let's get one thing straight.  This is a library, not Romper Room.  I don't mind hearing the occassional whispers, or even quiet talking to the person next to or across from you.  I engage in such activity myself.  If I wanted total silence in all things, there are places in the library I could go.  But even in the most "liberal" sections of the library, some modes of decorum and respect must and should still be observed.  If someone could talk quietly on their cell phone, I might not be so offended.  But the rule that requires everyone to shout into the phone makes using a cell phone in the library a most inappropriate action.  Since you're obviously not studying anyway, you might as well pick yourself up from your chair and proceed to the nearest area where it is permissible to speak on one.  I can only guess that the same laziness that is preventing you from studying also stymies your efforts to extract yourself from your chair and take the long journey across the stacks to the nearest stairwell or exit.  One wonders how you muster up the energy to drive all the way here and sit through the bar review class without requiring life-support or an oxygen tank.  Guess I'd better get back to work now...while it's relatively quiet in here.
