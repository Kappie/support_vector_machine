First there's the  urlLink Mobile Edge Messenger Bag , which has extra padding, comfort shoulder straps and an expansion panel for pack rats like me. The  urlLink Mobile Edge Totes  don't scream "laptop bag" at all and could easily pass as a regular handbag if you like your totes Winona-sized.    The Sakar iConcepts Explorer is so weird-looking, I love it. It's cheap ($20-$50), extremely durable, and somewhere between military chic and amphibian. It should be available at  urlLink CompUSA  this summer.     JZMO has the funkiest looking-bags, and although they don't look it, they are designed for business, with pockets for your PDA and business cards, and extra-thick padding. Also, 100% of the profits from sales of the Limited Edition Executive Bag, in pink leather and suede, will go to breast cancer charities. The  urlLink Think Pink Bag  can be pre-ordered now for $249.      urlLink Xeni Jardin , of  urlLink BoingBoing  wrote in  urlLink Gizmodo  about her  urlLink Talene Reilly Silouette Bag . This might be the best-looking of all the bags I've looked at, plus it has a pocket for the power cord (power cord pocket=love) and a teflon coating which makes the fabric water and stain repellant. It's also much pricier than the others, at $315-$358. Wouldn't you know it...
