He's really very FAT when he was in sec sch and also looks very different. Super duper different. Now he so ai mei..wear contacts..haha..but I'm still FAT as I always am. very funny..Lim and I laughed when we saw his pic..  Oh ya! Our NOODLE family was formed today. All thanks to Wilson. He's already so skinny yet he wants to go to slimming centre. Cos of his size, Lim called him noodle.  Then Theo named the rest of us. Jerren:bee hoon, Wilson:mee sua, Theo:mee hoon kuay, Steph Yap:yu mian, Steph Lim:ee mian, Roy:meepok..He named the remaining girls fishball, fishcake, tau gay, tau kua, tau pok and cockel..wahahaha! Our TBCM teacher was called ban mian cos of her hair..Very mean rite? But nvm..  Basically, we're crapping the whole day. See the TBCM teacher already can laugh. But Theo kept making me laugh during DBMS. Observe the teacher's eyes and the way she speaks, then IMITATE! not his fault la..we gotta have eye contact with the teacher when lessons are going on..*Theo imitates the way she pops her eye* (pop_your_eye.enabled = True) haha.. ;p  Lim's damn hyper today. Kept on talking and making noise non-stop, since the time we met in the morning till the end of school..still can't stop. uh oh...something's wrong. She accidentally caused Wilson to drop Jerren's hp on the floor till it was dismantled into a million partitions. But miraculously, the hp din go bonkers!  It's such  a fun day (except for DBMS prac. I lost my Country table..haha..) I'm still very alert now..but the effect of the caffeine from the coffee I had this morning is gonna be 'OFF' soon..getting tired. tml got MATHS..so sianz..of all subjects, MATHS!! ARGH!
