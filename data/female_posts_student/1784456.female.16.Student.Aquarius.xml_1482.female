I just watched someone win Crystal Maze! *i'm obsessed, i confess! i watch it all the time!* But it's like Takeshi's Castle hard to win! *err... that's more of a need* AND I saw someone dressed up as a Ghost Buster!!! WOWWW! I sooo should have said something! (Actually it was a bit scary cause they were standing outside the house opposite!) Hmm... hehe... cool idea for my 18th birthday party! Muhahahahaaa... *not that i'd invite anyone serious enough not to be that stupid anyway* Hehe, maybe I should say that to people. that would confuse them well enough!
