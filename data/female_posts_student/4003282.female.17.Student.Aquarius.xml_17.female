Someone asked me who my Hero is. I told them Kebra Selah. Because she truely is. The way she lived her life and how she changed so many people has just changed my life. I got a rubberband that says live strong on it. And then on the other side I wrote in loving memory of Kebra. Because I think she would have wanted to every to just live strong. It so amazing how this complete stranger has changed my life. Today when I was about to say something rude. Kebra pop in my mind and I just didn't say anything at all. It was so weird. I'm so happy I went to Kat's xanga. And came upon this website. I'm still so very sorry for her family. I don't know what they are going through. But it must be the roughest thing ever. My love and prayers go to all of them. Just remember she is still blessing people here just like she has blessed me.        Kebra. I want you to know. That I don't know what made you make that decision and I'll never understand competly why. But your my hero no doubt. Your such a wonderful girl. And I hope that you dance and smile in heaven. I really wish I got the chance to meet you and become your friend. But I think now I have. I talked with you last night. You and god. And I'm happy I am on this path again and not on the one that I used to be on. Thanks so much for what you did while you were here. Your will always be in my heart.   I will never forget you.     In loving   urlLink  Memory    of Kebra Selah
