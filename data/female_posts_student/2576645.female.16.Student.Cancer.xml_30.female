The 'inbetween'.  I look out the window then And I try to follow the flake with my eyes All the way down.  But they fall to fast.  My eyes are left behind.  It's about time they caught up with the rest of my body.  And isn't it odd? When the falling begins I shudder.  And isn't it odd? When it stops I'm abandoned.  But its ok...I'm used to it. Since the trees are bare I can be grey.  And I can be tired And scared And sick of my imperfections.  However... It's nice to see things have purpose When I'm not quite sure of mine.  And it's nice to know that some things make sense.  And it's nice to know that others don't.  I can see the world as 'beautiful' Or at least against the backdrop of me wandering.  Or at least to find something To follow it  With my eyes.  But I bet I'll be too slow And what I search for... What I watch for... Will slip and fall.  Maybe one day I'll catch it on my tongue.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An after thought:  I talked to my grandparents on the phone, and I was thinking about something I said.  Grandma: So...hows your love life? Me: Non-existant. Grandma: Thats not true, I bet you have tons of good looking guys. Me: Yeah......imanginary ones.  Song of the Day: 'In My Place'- Coldplay
