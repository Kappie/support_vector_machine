Amanda was a lifesaver and brought me the coolest gift ever.  :)  She made an awesome photoalbum dealio with cool stuff and inside jokes.  And she gave me candy (which I love) and more bracelets and a jewelry box.  Jessica O. gave me a great card, and so did Harshita.  :)  People gave me hugs, too.    I got a few checks from family that I'm going to put in savings for my trip to Belize.  Now dad is yelling at me about a stupid dinner thing.  This is my english speech:  	 My fellow citizens.  Today is the day that will change all days in America's future.  I am honored to stand in front of you and to accept this role to change our nation for the better.  Yesterday, the American flag stood for freedom and civil rights.  Tomorrow, it will stand for terror, injustice, inhumanity towards minority groups, and chaos.  This process, though it seems long, will take less than four years.  I will begin by making up lies about fellow presidential candidates. I will not provide the facts.  I will hack into the electronic voting machines, rigging the voting system that was once treasured and valued as a democracy. I will do anything to ensure I win.  After my election, I will pass laws that take away the rights of minority groups or ban them from their civil rights altogether.  I will let my views of the church interfere with my role as President. I will ignore the separation of Church and State, and ban human beings from marriage or their civil rights.  I will weaken laws that protect the environment and safety of every individual in this country, eventually impacting the whole world.  I will reward companies who send jobs overseas, when the unemployment rate is still struggling to recover. I increase government spending so that the country will be in a $480 billion deficit by the end of the year so that future generations will have to pay it off.  I will lower taxes for the rich, and raise taxes for the middle and lower class.  I will sign laws that allow corporations to confidentially report their mistakes and have their fines waived.  I will allow millions and millions of pounds of airborne toxins to be released into Texas, resulting in unhealthy living conditions for millions of people, and still claiming that "the air in Texas is cleaner."  I will plant false information about other countries and mislead the American people that war is the only way to settle foreign affairs.  I will allow hundreds of American soldiers and civilians to die fighting a war caused by my lies and deceit. I will weaken America's ties to the allies by going against the wishes and causing more war that will only benefit myself.  I will foster ignorance in the American people, who will be too blind in their patriotism to question me.  I am George W. Bush, and I want you to vote for me in the election of 2004.  While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.    We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.	   "Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives."  "We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans."  These exact words were said by George W. Bush in his inauguration on Saturday, January 20th, 2001.  Many of the things that Bush has promised us have not yet materialized.  We are still waiting for our schools to better and the lives of American people to improve.  Yet many of us still do not question him, do not ask him why.  It is time to see behind the mask, and to see what really lies in the heart of our president, George W. Bush.   I had to give my english speech today, it wasn't that bad except for when kids in my class finally understood what I was talking about, a few kids started saying shit to me... one kid told me to shut up and sit down even.  How fucking rude.  Anyway... I'm hungry so I'm hopefully going to Buca's tonight for dinner.  :)  I want spaghetti.
