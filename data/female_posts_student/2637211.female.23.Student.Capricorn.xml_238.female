I already posted a possible  urlLink bridesmaid dress  from  urlLink David's Bridal . But I'm still not sure about the ethics of getting a dress from such a mass market place, but compared to a lot of what I've looked at, it seems so affordable. I probably won't buy my gown there.   The  urlLink other dress  that I really love is a little bit too expensive at $318. The website won't let me copy the image of the dress, so you'll have to go there to see how lovely it is. It's a similar style as the other dress, but so much more style. I like how it's patterned and not just one color. But based on how appealing these two dresses are, I'm really leaning towards a spring green and white wedding. Everything will go with white flowers and their green stems. It seems so simple.
