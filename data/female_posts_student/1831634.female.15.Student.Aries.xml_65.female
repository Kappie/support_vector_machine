I'm reading a nice kenshin fanfic, though!  =)  I want to go back to reading kenshin in chinese.  though that will keep me from my hw.  which is bad.  I got stuck on 22 on the bookwork and was too tired to do the worksheet.  didnt do french yet, either.  but it's french.  haha.  finished bio lab, though!!  =D  yay.  I accidentally touched an anther then rubbed my nose with the same finger.  not smart.  now I can't stop sneezing.  whoo.  no one is online...  I did my chinese hw in record time today!  one hour for an entire week!  that's amaaazing.  especially since the hour was from 12.30-1.30 am.  haha.  I am seriously turning into a zombie.   I'd like to see if I can go 24 hours w/o sleep, but I have chinese school tomorrow, so it may not be that smart.  oooo.  gotta give eileen something for her birthday.  anyway.  I'm so sleepy I'm turning hyper.  which is never good.  =D  see, I'm hyper enough to be updating my blog like this.  meng, are you okay, dearest heart?  [hehe, that sounds so cool.]  depression does not suit your rosy cheeks!  [puahaha.]  seriously, though.  be you okay?  now.  sleep for sunshine.  kailing, do be a good bonny lass now.  ^~  and tell me.  do you really hate jack and chuan?  b/c i am getting worried about your strange ramblings.  now. really sleep for sunshine.  not really.  first read 60,000 more words of fic.  then sleep.  XD
