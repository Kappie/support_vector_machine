And obviously, they have a free computer! Hahaha. We got here around 3:00 this afternoon and drove around a bit and saw some sorority houses and stuff. And my dad's old frat house. The campus of LSU is pretty, all in Spanish architecture with palm trees and stuff. I like it. Tomorrow we're gettnig a tour at 10:00. Then after that around 7:00 we're meeting some old friends of my dad's and we're going to this really modern and cool sushi restaurant! I'm pretty excited because I love sushi. Then Friday we're going out to eat with some other dudes, and Saturday is what I'm excited about because we're going to some really nice retaurant with this mucho rich friends of my dad's that he went to college with. I'm talking like, millionaires. Seriously. We went to their house last year when we came down here for the LSU/Florida game, and WHOA. I really don't mean to sound rude, but if you saw the house you'd understand haha. It will be interesting. But yeah, I think this trip is turning out to be pretty fun! I didn't think it would be but I'm having a nice time. :-D I wrote Goodson a very lovely e-mail telling her where I was hehe. :-P The home of the one and only, LSU TIGERS! Haha.  Thanks for the text messages! They make me happy hehe. Well, I better go because it looks like some dude wants to get on here and he's looking pretty     ed! Bye!!
