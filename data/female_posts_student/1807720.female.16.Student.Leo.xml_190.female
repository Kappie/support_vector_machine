I mean I don't really know what the message of that dream was trying to convey.  It was just weird.  This morning I went to the YMCA to work out, and I feel so good now that I have.  It's like seriously some sort of energy booster.  I feel good about myself, healthy, and just happy.  I miss school too, not like that is any surprise.  It was nice to be at the Y, kind of reminded me of school you know.  I also talked to Chelsey today.  I had an amazing talk with her this morning.  It was just like the old conversations we used to have when we were even better best friends then we are now.  No arguing or anything, just someone to talk to about my worries and everything.  God, now I realize why it's so important to have a best friend.  They are always there for you.
