The Jane Austen Book Club  which wasn't that bad, but I think it might be hard to have a book discussion about a book that's about a book club--if that makes any sense. It was good though. I also read  The Hellion Bride , a paperback that I found up at Hilltop (our cottage). I finished that one in a day. The next one I'm going to read is  Dantes Club . Kind of philosophical mystery, like  Da Vinci Code . Actually, the librarian that recommends  Da Vinci Code  to us last summer, also recommends this book. She told us to read it before it it was a number one best seller, so I have a feeling this one is going to be good too. Besides the book, I've spent some lazy days at the beach. My brother broke his collarbone so we haven't done much swimming. My Aunt is coming up today with her two boys Jack and Joe. It's raining, so I hope it will clear up, but my mom just read the forecast and its supposed to rain all day. And its supposed to be cloudy the next few days. Great, they drive 3 in a half hours for it to rain. Oh boy, this should be interesting.  ***Hi Catie! Having fun by yourself? :) Tell Jo I say hi and welcome home. We'll all be home in a few days. I think we're shooting for late Saturday. See you then!
