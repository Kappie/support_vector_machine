I am also finding it difficult to go for 5 mins without looking at my blog or someone elses... v. worrying! at least i'm getting it all out i guess. My favourite muse song by far has to be screenager... listen to it again anyone who's reading this... how amazing is his voice?! Deya... I dont mean this to be offensive but you really need to listen to the lyrics.. I think they are true of you... (does that make sense?) Dont take that badly please!!! I think that you would understand what I am trying to say to you through the words of Muse.. plus you can't shout backat me!!! just remember I'm always here and I love you.. xxx Oh yeh... just while I remember... thanks for everything Jenni... I know I probably get annoying after a bit, but thank for letting me talk to you etc.. you're a legend. Especially thanks for coming to see Mrs M with me... it cant have been nice for you either xxx  I love you all!! (but i love luce more!!!) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
