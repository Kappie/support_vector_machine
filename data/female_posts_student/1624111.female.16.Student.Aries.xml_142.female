CrAzY day.  i feel absolutely insane. and mentally unstable.   and i miss emily sooooooooo much.   and my life is so f*cked up. and i want to go back to the summer after 8th grade when there was no doubt in my mind that this would ever happen.  I swear it will be a miracle if i dont cry in english tomorrow.
