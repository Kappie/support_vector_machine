Oh well,lesson learned. I went to McDonald's with my mom after work, they screwed up my order, and got it right after a few times(STUPID!). And I took a shower, played Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life(which is, by the way, THE BEST GAME EVER.......). The Internet was down,until now.I'm glad the Internet's back..........Don't know what I'd do without it............Signing Off,Your Friend Rachel H.
