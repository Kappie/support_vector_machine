We could go and hide in a hole I guess but there aren't holes big enough out there. But not being at school has kind of screwed the whole social system that we had going... not like anyone was really paying attention to it anyway. All the layers have been destroyed. Theoretically anyone could talk to anyone else. But we still don't. Is it gonna be any different when we get to 6th form? Am I ever going to get to Glastonbury?
