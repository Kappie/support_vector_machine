I NEED MORE DYE! i didnt  have enough so i could dye the back... i hope nobody notices... maybe ill just wear a bunch of hats all the time.  my kitty is so cute! and soft. I wonder if i tried to dye her tail purple if she would eat the dye. That would be bad... but shed be all cute if she was purple!! haha.  my dad's a dick. he wont let me go to jessies. And i'm bored.  I got glasses today... i look SO geeky! the guy was telling me what was fashionable and i put on all these insanely crazy colors of glasses and i looked like everything from robocop to martha stewart. There were these glasses that were made of metal and then lenses didnt touch the frames... they were suspended by tiny little wires in the corners.. it was so cool. But my glasses are boring. they arent so bad tho, they dont make me feel too super geeky. And i'll be able to see now. Which is a very good thing.  uh.  i guess thats it.   Whats 300 feet long and has no pubic hair?       ... the line in front of a Blink 182 show.    ~abby
