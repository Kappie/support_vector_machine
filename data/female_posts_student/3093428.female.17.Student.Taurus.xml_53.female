Anywho, I gotta tell you about day 4...  Day 4 has had to been my best day, by FAR! I organized my songs and burned some CD's and that was kind of fun. Then I went out to Hon's with Julian for dinner! We had a chat about my grade 12 year because apperently he and some other people were woried about my education. I talked to him and explained what courses I was takling and we both had a great time! It's good to know that people really do care for me too! Then it was off to PJ's with Anne, and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun! We played this Awesome game and Anne and I kept on blocking his one place and, well, you had to have been there. It was great though! Really was!  Day 5 was a noon game at the stadium. So it was fine, I was top hawker. Then it was chill time with Nelly and Joyce at White Spot! That was fun! Although the food was a little disapointing, but thats ok. I then brought Nelly to my place where we got some hockey sticks and ran into Sarah! That was fun too! Then we taught Nelly how to play hockey, then some 1 on 1, Garry and me. I lost 4-2 but it was pretty intense. Then we did some more random things and now I sit at home! I can't wait for this week to end though, it's just sooo weird.
