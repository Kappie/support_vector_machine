Im still rocking as much as I was yesterday, and I believe Operation HPB is going smoothly [Im such a loser.] Anyway today was an amazing day.. the whole morning/afternoon in school went by quickly, I did swicked on my Ancient History test, gym class was excellent [sub+hot hot heat], and I basically spent the remainder of the day with Behn. Did I ever mention that Im lucky as hell, because I am. And I know it, so dont go saying Im not thankful. Because I am, very.  Anyway so I just walked behn halfway home and we kind of had our long goodbye today since hes going away on his band trip next week, and we may or may not see each other tomarrow [hopefully yes]. Hes leaving sunday am  very  early and coming home next sunday, again with the earliness. Anyway I have to work tomarrow so Ill post again in the near future..   Lydia I guess your gone already :S but if you get this I miss you terribly. I never see you anymore and it sucks. I think its past time we got together over icecream :D  Lauren Ill call you when I get home from work about practice! you too Behn :)
