We went to Machester State Park, which is a campground by a beach and stuff. I met a bunch of Daniel's cousins and ate a burger and stuff. It was a pretty cool park, and the Seattle ferry drove by probably 6 times while we were there. Anyway, I'm back at mom's now and the house is kind of a mess so Daniel and I are going to clean it up for her. Then we are going over to his sister's house to babysit the kids (Ryan and Toni). They both had a lot of sugar today so I might be up really late. Better get to cleaning.
