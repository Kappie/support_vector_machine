I went to visit him before work today.  I hope he can come home tonight after work, but the vet has to see him first.  I suspect it will more likely be tomorrow, but I’m hopeful.  He is a mess; he is wearing one of those big collars to prevent licking his penis where the catheter is hooked.  His entire back area is drenched with urine because it is an open catheter so when the urine comes out it just leaks everywhere.  He was trying to groom himself this morning once the collar came off so he could eat, but it was too big of a job.  He just kept growling.  What time will you be over?  OHH WASN'T THAT FUNNY?! Anyways, I was watching A Baby Story to pass the time. AHH I know, but there was nothing else on. It was just really funny. The girl was from England and she married this New York actor. Her parents came to visit and they could have been her great-grandparents, there were so damn old. They weren't going to tell anybody the name of their kid until he was born, so it was a big secret. First off, she had a C section. Her husband walks out afterwards and is like "That was awesome!" Dude, they just slit a whole right through her stomach and out popped a kid, no, that's not awesome, that's freaky barbarian stuff. Birth really creeps me out. Guess what they named him? RIVER, I know, what is that?!
