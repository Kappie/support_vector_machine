I had the greatest revelation...i am gonna install another OS on my system only after I get another hard disk. I dont ever wanna go thru the trouble of reinstallation ever again. As they say the process is totally "Mendoukusai"... And I found out the first thing I needed badly to install on my system b4 starting out with anything else was google's toolbar on IE.
