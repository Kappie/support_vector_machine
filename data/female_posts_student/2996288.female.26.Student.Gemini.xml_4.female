What happened today?  Well, I watched a lot of television.  Apparently, somewhere on the medical liscencing (I can NEVER spell that word right...) exam, there will be a section on  urlLink Trading Spaces  because I've been watching an awful lot of that.  I betcha I get a 100% in the "Paint" section.  Yeah, right.  Well.  I'm hungry.  Again and always.  I want cake, and I'm gonna eat it!!!!!
