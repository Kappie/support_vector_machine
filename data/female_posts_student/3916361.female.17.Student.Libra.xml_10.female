We weren't busy at all because of all the rain we've been having so it was nice just being able to stand around eating peanuts and knowing that you're getting paid for doing nothing. Tiff stayed at my house and we watched a few movies.  One of them was Thirteen.  That is one messed up movie.  It's about 2 thirteen yr. old girls who do drugs and drink and have sex...Yeah and the ending sucks! Well, I don't have any plans until tonight and Tiff is baby-sitting all day long. Maybe I'll give Brett a call...
