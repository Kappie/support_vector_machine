So anyways, the name's Kaleigh (KAYlee), known as Kaleigh Jo or just plain ole Jo. I'm a seventeen year old southern redhead currently working in and out of a modeling career. Don't worry, I'm not ditsy, or a spoiled brat, or, based on my whereabouts, a hick!  Getting ready for a great summer and a great senior year in highschool ahead of me. Currently single, but not exactly looking, annddd not exactly NOT looking either. I'm a strong believer in fate, so when the right guy comes along, I'll know it, hopefully. Long stories in love. But who doesn't have any? Interested? Just ask me about 'em, I'll spill my heart out. ;) I love people, they absolutely fascinate me. So feel free to write me on this journal or AIM me at Goober3316. Actually, PLEASE do. I'd love to meet you!  Can't wait to get this thing started...:::crosses fingers::: -Kaleigh Jo-
