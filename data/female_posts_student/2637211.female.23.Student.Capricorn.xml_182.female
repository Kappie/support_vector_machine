I just don't understand why she has to be such an ass all the time. It is really getting to be a hassle, I can't deal with having to pretend everything is all right with her or something.   I've been thinking more about the argument we had about politics the other day, and I'm thinking, maybe it wasn't just about politics. I think it was the only thing I felt free and justified about calling her on, and the only thing I felt right about having a conflict with her. I think I need to tell her how I feel, in person! I haven't seen her for so long, and all this is weighing way to heavily on me. I wasn't a jaw clencher like this until recently. I think I hurt myself last night in my sleep, because my jaw still hurts. I just don't know. I'm terribly upset and distraught about everything, because I love her and I hate to see her be such an ass. It's really getting harder and harder to deal with every day. Ow. My jaw hurts. I just need to use more of those relaxing, mind-numbing substances... oh booze. You are my best and closest friend that makes me feel better when I'm sad. And that other stuff is nice too, because then I'm at least more philosophical about the whole thing.
