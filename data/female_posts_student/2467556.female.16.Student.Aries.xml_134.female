Then we went to Sonic in the manual car!!!  i drove everywhere in the manual car!!!  we had a few bumps to deal with when it came to stop signs and i made a really loud screeching noise in the sonic parking lot.....but we made it alive!   Last night, Brittany made me come with her to the Hockey Shop because she was scared to go by herself (we won't mention the various theories as to why, lol jk Britty!)....we had fun walking around looking at sticks.  She went there to try and get the Stanley Cup Finals 2004 on DVD for our Vincent Lecavalier party this friday....but they didn't have it!  So she's going to try and order it online.  Then we went to Chick-fil-a, where i saw my buddy Tom Pierce and i said hi to him and stuff (he's manager of the Chick-fil-a!).  We ate there and then Britt took me home.  alright, dinner time, i'm out  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
