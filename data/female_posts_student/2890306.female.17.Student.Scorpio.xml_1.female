I had already eaten breakfast, so I only had one donut hole and a small cup of milk.  No matter how full I am, it is impossible to pass up a donut.  That must be a law of nature or something.  Our matinees went well.  The kids enjoyed our performances, as judged by their larger-than-life reactions to just about everything!  Mr. Pope said that many of the little boys wanted to know where they could get a sword of their own.  How completely darling!    Tomorrow's agenda?  1.   Two more matinees  2.   Contest recital in the choir room  3.   Class at The Bead Co. downtown  Should be a good day.  In closing, the best of nights to you.  Hopefully, I'll cross your path tomorrow.
