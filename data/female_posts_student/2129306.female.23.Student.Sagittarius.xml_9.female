My dear old car, a '91 Pontiac, has survived since my high school days, and has proven very reliable 98% of the time, but this is the first time in about a year that it has just been so darn cold (we're talking 4 degrees!) that is has chosen to ignore my pleas and not start. I put some heet in the gas tank and waited about 45 minutes, but still no good. Ugh. I think I'm going to take a nap and pray it starts once the temperature raises a bit.
