I signed up for this trip to run away from it all, really. And I see the people who do nothing but remind me painfully of everything I’m trying to leave behind. Ten days... and so much of that time spent in a seat just like this with nothing to do, really, but think about it. To think about how beautiful it was... and how very much it hurts, now, that it’s been lost.  Ten days... Ten days to see all the things we always wanted to see. The funny thing is, when I chose this tour, I never even thought about it. It was just somewhere, far away from San Francisco, far away from all the memories, and instead, every time I turn around, I’m confronted by those memories. All the things I want to share, to point out. Oh! Look! The way it blurs as we go along, it reminds me of that roller-coaster. And I want to giggle with you over the absurd antics of that small child. But you’re not here! And you won’t be, not ever again…
