It all started Tuesday when I had to wake up early and head out to go with Marina to get the restraining order against Travis. She had a CT Scan to go to in the same area so instead of having to go there come back and get me and then go get the TRO I went with her. The CT scan machine locked up so we were unable to do that until later that afternoon. I was gone from 9 until 6:30. (almost 7) When I got home Dave had taken the Amp out of the house against wishes and we had a huge blow up over that. We had not even begun to settle down from that when Travis arrived home and Kelley served him with the restraining order of which Travis (knowing this was going to happen) lost his temper and almost beat an MP. Travis then promply goes and breaks the restraining order (didnt get caught luckly) then comes home and calls Alexis 2 times. (still doesnt get caught)I get to bed about midnight 12:30 ish and get woke up at 1:20 by Tony and Joey fighting (fist to fist) over the fact Tony wouldnt move out of Joey's way to get a glass to get something to drink and Joey called him a "fag". (sigh) I finally get it settled down and back in bed about 3 and up at 6 to start another day of running around and doing things. Now today I'm going to help Robin pack and move some of her stuff providing she gets here. It's nearly 1 and she was suppost to be here about 10. Ok so we are working on Robin time.. Worse then Indian time Lol. Come to find out Dave came over today and was downloading stuff on the computer in the process has down loaded a virus. I'm going to just take the computer in to the shop and get it wiped clean and deal with it from there. I'm so sick of it. All the pictures and stuff are goign to need to be sent to e mail. I just dont want to deal with that it is going to take a long time. (sigh)   Well I should go. I have to drink my water (I just wolfed down toast) put the dinner in the slow cooker, wake up Tony, finish doing something with my hair and then hopefully Robin will be here. This morning I woke up at 6 to get Travis off to work went back to lay down for a few moments and ended up going to sleep until 11. It felt good to rest but in doing so I missed my time online and Joey was online when I got up and I dont kick him off because he doesnt get online often. So I cleaned and did some packing.   I have a lead on a place btw. I check it out today after 5. I hope I can get it. Other then that things are great.   me
