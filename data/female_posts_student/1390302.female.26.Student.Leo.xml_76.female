It is the most constant, consistent predictor of whether a relationship will endure.  On a 0 to 10 scale you scored 0.  People who score high in the ludus category view love as a game and may be wary of closeness.  Men are more likely than women to see love this way, but that doesn't mean men enjoy playing romantic games.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 2. A high score here indicates you closely link love and friendship. Storge is not particularly passionate love, but it is enduring. And it is not related to age: both younger and older people prefer this style.  On a 0 to 10 scale, you scored 4.  A high Pragma score means you take an extremely rational approach to love, carefully screening potential partners for certain qualities. Pragma is the least common love style.
