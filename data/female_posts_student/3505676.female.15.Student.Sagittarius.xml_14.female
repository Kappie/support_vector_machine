But it was a swim meet day so it was pretty fun plus there were lots of cute guys, a few of which came and asked me random questions and introduced themselves..pretty funny! Like, tough day huh? or can i borrow a blue marker? or even better, do you have a towel i can borrow, ill bring it back later.  But yeah! So it was a really easy day and i read all of the Guardian by Nicholas Sparks.  It was really good! Got to know some of my coworkers better too! Then my day got even better cuz who came to get their sunglasses back? BRADLEY! *haha* We hung out a bit, looking at stuff around the house, he met mi madre, uh...all that stuff! saw his new purchases! Then i went torero's w/ mi madre on our last night of just us! So had a yummy mexican dinner and uh..4 different waiters came to the table and by that pt mi madre REALLY began to tease me! Then we went to the airport to pick up jill and my dad! and who did i get to see @ the airport? LANEY!! hurray! *smiley* And then we got em, listened to stories on the way home, and now im home and oh so ready for bed! Cuz i def. only got like 5 hours last night! However, i am still a firm believer that SUMMER ROCKS!
