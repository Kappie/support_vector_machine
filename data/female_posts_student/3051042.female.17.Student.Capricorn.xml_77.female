Jessi and I hung out for the first time if forever. That was sort of weird. More random than weird since we dyed her hair during 4th-6th hours at her place. I don't understand how I'm passing high school. The door to her bathroom mysteriously wanted to open... we even put the hamper and the rug in front of it and it still wanted to open. I thought that wind usually shut doors, not forced them open.   And now... why is it that every time I REMOTELY think about you. Such as, "Damn, my day is going just GRAND I wish I had someone to talk with..." You just randomly come online? Maybe I'm too superstitious.  Cassie is at Mott's Psych Ward. They want to put her on meds. She think she should be on meds. Jessi thinks I should be on meds. Jessi thinks that Cassie has situational depression.   Jessi thinks I have bi-polar disorder or maniac depression... whatever they call it now-a-days. I think my days of therapy are over.  I want to go back to therapy  Shh... My mom won't pay for it. I don't think it'd do any good. I don't have situational depression. I don't have depression, I just have really bad mood swings. But Shh... no one knows about that... they're not suppose to. I'm perfectly fine. Really. REALLY.  Cameron is in a psych ward some where too. I think Charlie is going to end up in one by the end of the night. I had to save Andrea from a mental break down last night as well. I love her so. Keith, Andrea, and I are going to have our morning cigarettes and coffee while in Italy this summer. It'll be grand.... and legal. All of these problems with my friends is starting to weird me out. I now believe that spring is the epitome of mental problem random explosions.   AHH!!! Will anyone fucking listen to me?! argh... whatever.  I'm off to Q's house. Gotta pick Tiki up first.
