You know what's gonna be cool about this? This is kinda like a diary thing that that one lady uses in the tv series Sex In The City! How cool!  WELL, its like 5 in the mornin and heaven knows why i'm up at this time, probably cuz am not used to all the time change. GUESS WHAT!!! I just got back from England! Very cool place everyone just in case ya'll were wonderin! The people are FAB! And they have tea like 24/7 lol! just kiddin just kiddin. But am so proud of myself, i now know how to make a proper english tea!   Ok well anyway, i suppose i best say a lil about me so u know what my other letters will be like (sorry if this ones so boring, but it always is on an introduction innit?) weeeeellllllll.......... in general, am a really easy outgoing person. I don't have a split personality really. What ya see is what ya get i suppose! But that's just cuz i'm too lazy to develope a mean half lol! Anyone can tell ya that i love being around people and chillin with them! Am a really great listener so ya know, if any of ya need to talk am here for ya........ i may not have the best answers to your problems but hey everyone needsa shoulder to cry on yeah? ;) Don't worry bout catchin me at a bad time, am always in a good mood. Depends how much coffee i drink lol :D the more espresso shots, the happier i am! Ok anway, i hate it when people blab on too much about themselves so i'll leave it at that for now.   Adios! :D
