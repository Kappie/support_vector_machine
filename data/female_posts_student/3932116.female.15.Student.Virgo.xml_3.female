(and his 3 cats) not too much is goin on, just enjoying the lazy days of summer..finally. i did drive here from the west virginia turnpike...which is not a modest haul. tonite we have a cook out to attend and the rest of the week remains unscheduled...just laid back activities, semi-spur of the moment. dad's cats are even kicking back, spaz (my cat) and then there's dog (?) and chief..i named that one..imagine that! lol. joe doesn't think that's its name..but what does he know, it's just his cat..lol. well, i'll try and chronicle my week..however, i don't know how well that will go. i didn't write last nite, cuz i was pretty exhausted.. and not too much happened...we rented school of rock and watched that..tis about it. i'm outtie
