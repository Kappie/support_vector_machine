My race was terrible and then I went out to dinner and my dad and Sheila were bickering about how he wasn't being supportive about stupid people but it was okay. I didn't eat much beacuse I wasn't too hungry at the time. I could go for some macaronie and cheese now though. Oh well... so yea I'm talking to Mick and Derrick though so it's cool. Talkin to Mick about ND as always and Derrick and I are talking about nothing wich can be fun I guess lol. Yea, well I better start my Homework. Peace x0x0x0x0x0x
