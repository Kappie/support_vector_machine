Today the little girl slapped me across my eyes and now I have a headache and am in a pissed off mood. Fuckers. Buddy is coming in tomorrow, but ACT's the next day. When will summer begin?! At least after the test it's time for a mini-road trip to CLEVELAND! WOO blink again and No Doubt- old school. That's all for now.
