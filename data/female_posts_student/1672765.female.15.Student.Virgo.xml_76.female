"Homesick" - The Cure   hey hey! just one more and i'll walk away all the everything you win turns to nothing today and i forget how to move when my mouth is this dry and my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky oh it was sweet it was wild and oh how we...i trembled stuck in honey honey cling to me so just one more just one more go inspire in me desire in me to never go home oh just one more and i'll walk away all the everything you win turns to nothing today so just one more just one more go   inspire in me desire in me to never go home
