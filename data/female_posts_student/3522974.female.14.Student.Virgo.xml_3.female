Sarah and Gemma were skating slow so un-co me could catch up, when a fat little asian boy skated up and said "Your so slow" to gemma. The only reason she was going slow was bcoz of me, so i told gem to skate past him and say "well, atleast im not fat" (im such a hipocryt). Neway she said to me she didn't wanna diss a lil kid, so instead we tagged him "Stumpi", a pj to live on 4ever...I decided to skate over to him and ask what his name was, but as soon as the words left my lips, he was gone. After a while i saw his chubby torso again and skated over to him to ask again. "What is your name?" he skated ahead pretending he hadnt heard. A while later our eyes locked and next thing i knew he was getting off the rink.  I lost the chance to meet the man of my dreams....sych . Once my group was off the ice and out the front of the centre waiting for out snail of a teacher, i saw his school pass. When i spotted him i decided to give the innocent, beady eyed, singing school boy one more chance to answer. He approached with caution singing silently to himself as i stood at the door. I asked again and, and, and, he ignored me once again still singing his Yu-gi-oh tune. Bummer. Meh, i think i would've liked Stumpi better than his real name. That one is gold, it gives off vibes. I hope i taught him a lesson " never diss older pplz, or ur stuffed 4 life "
