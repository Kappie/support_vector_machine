It's understandable that a person may be quiet around their friends and talkative with their loved one because the reason they are that person's loved one is because they feel they can be the most open and comfortable with them. Make sense? But, as Sean so eloquently stated, it depends on the situation and who is around. Bottom line, sometimes people to crazy things and are entirely unpredictable and not able to besummed up inone sentence. So... Yeah.There is my quite possibly indecipherable standpoint.    --Ashley M. Ludewig--
