Parents who have, since the sex talk, decided to let us hornby it up by ourselves. Secondly, we got over the hump. Celebrate it. Stephanie peed her pants and threw up several times, while I puked in the beautiful blue ikea garbage can. We had a fight, actually..we had numerous fights. None of which are remembered by me now. We talked to Caleb all night..made plans for our photo shoot. Took some of our own photos. Hence the title. Elegantly...naked..photos... Masterpieces. Stayed up all night. Babysat...although..were too..'intoxicated' to watch the kid, heard it yell though..stuck a bottle in her mouth. I love that baby:) Finished with the night time..ate breakfast (china food) Also..talked to Curtis last night for a good and long time. Fantastically interesting stuff. Danced for people on webcam. Extremely exciting. Can't breathe. Forgot to take my pill again. Can't swallow..but maybe that's just our 'dry mouth' syndrome. Day..interesting...Night..more so. Going to the parade in a few hours. Should be interesting. Going to the fireworks tonight, should be..firey. That is all. Good day to all of you people who are bored enough to read this profile, I feel bad for you, truly truly sorry and truly truly disgraced.
