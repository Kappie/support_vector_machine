Same story with that word. And the next one. And the next one. I continued this for aproximitely seven rounds before I remotely understood a definition. (These were hard words I'm not quite that ignorant) Needless to say I forgot the original word. Now that's not how dictionaries are supposed to work. C'mon Webster help me out here......
