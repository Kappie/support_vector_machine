I would break even or win $3, $6 or even just a ticket.  Nevertheless, today holly shit, I turned in my $6 worth and got three scratchier, won, a total of $83. Not bad!!! Its only $83 buts I am excited, I am happy and the most important part of all, I won 83 bucks, FREE.  Gosh man, I am sitting here thinking about cashing my scratchier for cash and use that on grocery and get more tickets. However, there is this little voice inside my head that tells me not to be greedy and that I shouldn't. Lol.   Saturday   After work, I went out to eat with a couple of friends. Then went home and relax I was actually watching the discovery channel. Can you believe that? Walking with the Caveman was playing. I know that I should have picked all this at school but you know me, never pays close attention in class. I found it very interesting no matter how sleepy I was I stood up watching that show. I fell a sleep after the first hour.  I think the movie was five hours long itself.    Can anyone tell me where to get the movie? I really want this movie; it was based on what in the world happen on earth. Documentary from billions of years ago.   Sunday  I went to a house warming in Sacramento. The house was five thousand square feet for only $358 thousand dollars. It is in a nice ass neighborhood. Shit, that was hella cheap.   Now, I have been fantasizing about my future house. It has been going through my head for the pasted two days now. It is not too soon to think of what I really want for my house right. I have so many things in mind. Big and expensive is what I am aiming for. I do not mean to brag, but I told my mom and grandma about this yesterday.  They were very nice enough and very happy to help me. THANKS, a million, I think I will need that.  Friends asked me, what’s wrong with the place I’m living right now? Why would I want to live alone with just Alyssia and myself?  My answer was, “Do you think I want to live in this shit hole for the rest of my life?”
