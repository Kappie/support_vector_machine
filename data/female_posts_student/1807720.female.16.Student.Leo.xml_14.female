The only thing I really got confused with was dissociation vs. ionization but I thought everything was alright.  And well I got a 73% on my math test which is ok but I know I am so much smarter than that and could do better but I messed up two M.C. questions and they are worth 2 marks each.  And well last time I got a 72% on a test the math teacher told me that I could do better and she told me that she knows I can do the material and then today I got like one percent higher and she was like "Oh Vanessa you did so awesome" so yeah that doesn't really make any sense and I think she was just trying to make me feel good.    And well AGAIN me and Chels got into another fight this time it was during lunch.  I feel kind of bad through I mean I NEVER meant to be harsh or mean or anything like that but I guess it came out that way.  I just was informing her that I thought maybe she should eat a little more cause sometimes she skips meals and stuff and she is so small and thin and it worries me.  And then she was accusing me of calling her anorexic which NEVER once came out of my mouth at all, it came from her head.  I was never trying to upset her, or make her angry or mad at me, I was only worried.  But she got all defensive and told me she was sick or me and said that "Every time we talk we always argue"  which I totally can agree on cause that is EXACTLY how I feel too.  But well I don't think me and her stand on high grounds right now, we can never agree and I always feel I am competing about her.  I hate it how she never stops talking about Chem and "oh I get this, and Oh this makes so much sense."  It is SO annoything and it makes me feel really bad about myself because it makes me feel like I can't do anything right.  Sometimes I wish Monet had never come to the school this year I mean she is a nice girl but ever since she came along me and Chels can do nothing but argue and fights and today Chels walked right by me in the hall and didn't even notice me - Go figure she was too busy talking to Monet to notice I was ever there.  I feel so lost, so empty it was like me and Chels and so much in common and she was my best friend.  But I guess people change, but I don't want it to be true I NEVER wanted it to be true.  I don't know who I really define as a good of friend as she was, I don't really have any other friends that I could share that best friend relationship thing with.  I am confused again right now but I suppose that is the whole point of being a teen.     Thoughts of my Heart  Always fighting, Nothing is right Monet comes along, Steals you away Why does it have to be like this?  Never wanted this friendship to end Something came between us We are different people, different now Different goals, different dreams  A same pure heart though Music taste we shared Fun times together Especially summer, remember?  What went wrong? What did I say? To make you feel mad and angry Everything is this way  I do not know what to do Have no clue what to say Do not know how to heal Cannot figure how to deal  Friends do come Friends do go Why though must it be you Not this time, one more change  Work things out Play with a better hand Get things straight Tell our story  Why can't we just work things out? Why give up? It is not that just easy It is the easy way out  And if I had the courage strong To talk to you to find the time Make things better Heal this flood tonight  Things are different now Must admit No one to talk to, to one to share those times together, precious and rare  To only remember tommorow just is One more day to work together Find a way to heal this scar Make this better, lighten this load  Sometimes only you can give Just some choices Seem so simple To die or to live  Wondering if I were gone or pleading for a life not worth Would anyone care? How would I know  Blood so vain Stab through my heart Consume to many pills My wrists are and art  If I were just struggling to make it through would you be there? Would you care too?  ~Vanessa     And lately Alex has totally been coming on to me, and to be honest I actually really sort of like it.  I never thought it would ever be him of all people and I don't think he ever though he would like me cause he always seemed to have a thing for Ash but as I said before - people change, times change, things change.  This whole world is like one big circle of change.  And now that I think of it Alex actually would be so my match.  I mean we have our differences but he is URAINIAN! and so am I which is totally cool cause everyone in my family ends up marrying a Ukrainian guy by fait I guess cause no one ever plans for it to happen.  Like my sis caught that cutie urainian Ben which she is getting married to next year.  Melissa is taking me shopping for my dress in December and I am the Maid of Honor.  It is gonna be so cool and I get a purple dress cause that is the theme color of the wedding!  My fav. color!  Man it feels like I have so much to say cause well who else am I going to talk to?!?!...I have no clue.  Chelsey used to be there to talk, but another reason why I just get soooo angry at her and others sometimes is I never get ANYTHING out but when I do get something out - I sure get alot more to come out than planned.  And well yeah usually end up exploding at people.  I wonder if anyone is going to want to eat lunch with me tommorow - everyone always goes to A but I don't really like it there cause there are no heathy kinds of foods.  Maybe I can drag Alex or Ash to Wendys to have a good ole' healthy salad with me - HOPEFULLY.  Cause well I have been having lots of hot chocolate lately cause of my cold and sore throat and well during dinner for a couple nights this week I have been like the incredible eater or something because I just can't stop eating at night now which is probably why I haven't lost any more weight since the summer but everyone keeps coming up to me and saying how they didn't recongnize me like Alison that I met in Drama last year she told me today that she didn't even realize who I was until like the third week of school.  I didn't realize my weight loss was that noticable but HA..after like a million times to figure out how to loose weight the answer is so simple however I haven't have the will power lately to keep up with my good healthy eating habits quite often so once in a while I slip in one of those sugary pops that I am sure are like the worst things in the world cause of all the sugar.  But well I have lost about 40 pounds since April which is definetly something that I definetly could not predict a while's back but well I guess it was my sis in the first place that got me going.  She started to loose weight for her wedding and then I wanted to loose some because I didn't want her being thinner than me and well then me and her lost some weight and now we can fit in each others clothes so yeah when I get to see her I might raid her somewhat of a wardrobe cause she always raids my closet when she comes over.  But well they are living in their trailer in their backyard right now because of the water main break that happened a while ago.  It flooded there house and causes major damage so the house is basically like falling apart now and the walls are caving in a and buckling so they are probably gonna get a new house built after the old one is torn down and stuff and as long as no one disapproves of the plan and stuff.  It is complicated and they are young so it ain't like they have alot of money and the city sure didn't cover much for insurance.
