So we're going to his party around three, and then to care group.  Jenni's having her friend Maisie spend the night.  She's one of my favorites of my sister's friends...just bursting with energy and vitality.  Actually, there's only a couple of Jenni's friends that I don't like, actually. My throat hurts really badly...I'll spare the mucus details.  First my back, then my throat...as soon as one heals, another thing flares up.  I hope the next one isn't a stomachache...I can bear colds, coughs, sore throats, even the flu, but I'm a baby when it comes to stomachaches.  I do believe they're the most abominable thing that can happen to someone.  Thank goodness that's the worst pain I know, although getting your foot stepped on by a horse and having someone crush down on your pinky toe with a chair are pretty painful too. U know what?  There aren't very many hot guys at our school.  No especially smokin guy to gawk at, which is a very dangerous thing for adolescent girls, who need someone to drool at besides hot guys from The O.C. and shows like that.  Actually, I think Adam Brody, the guy who plays Seth, is the hottest one on there [u'd think I'd like Chris Carmack (Luke) or Benjamin Mackensie (Ryan), but I don't think either is particularly hot].   I'm kinda fatigued (even though it's 9:30 AM), so I think I'll just end this entry with a quiz result.  Later.    Heaven: You are a true angel. You are destined to move on to a place where there is no evil, just people as beautiful and pure as you. Graceful and classy, an angel like you has wonderful things ahead!
