He should be returning to his base camp within the next day or so and I am going to bug him for details of his stay at another camp. I hope that he is getting the care he deserves and needs. I will be sending him another care package soon, this time with a few items his mother gave to me to send him.  The question was why couldn't she send the package to him, afterall she hasn't sent him anything since he has been gone, but I have come to the conclusion it has to do with the fact that she is dealing with her only son being overseas in her own way, which happens to be out of sight out of mind. Now Viki (Jesse's mom) and I have never gotten along that well but I did let her know that if she ever needed anything to call and I would be there for her. I know that she will never take me up on the offer, but at least she knows that dispite all that she has done to me and Jesse, I have chosen to be the bigger person because of the love I have for Jesse.
