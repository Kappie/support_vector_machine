Come on, holidays are times 4 bludgin and we did exactly that! And now we r paying 4 it! So our dance was mank. It's gotten a bit betta tho. Which is good. Because we sent out invites 2 heaps of church people (skool peeps r already coming) so everyone must come! dw, we'll get it better. All "nice and professional looking" as Gemma said. It's a journey...and we're on our way. Come 2 MSPA!! Ooo...that rhymes!! hehe Bloggin off, Beth  Ooo yah heard, i'm bustin' ass my word!
