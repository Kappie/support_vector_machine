Okay, recapping...my ex-stepdad isnt suppose to be near our house or contact us what so EVER and well..this morning he was watching us all leave for school and my mom for work..and he stole our dog. Yeah..he stole my dog. So, i went down to the police station at like 10pm cuz thats when my mom finally decided to report it and come to find out in NC u get 10years in jail if you steal a dog, and he doesnt need any more years racked up than he already has- if they can find him. Gee, what a life. Anyways, so my dog is gone..poor molly..and to make things worse the SHERRIF comes by the house today looking for mike, and well..mike doesnt live here anymore and hasnt..hes not suppose to. well, he leaves after a short Q session with my mom. A cop hasnt stopped by lookin for him since november when this all went down. anyways, we go to the police station and while we were waiting there was a mouse in the lobby..aww it was so cute. 30mins later, its dead..cuz this young cop (about 20) was showing off and played "hero" and STOMPED on the sleeping mouse in a corner...ew. its guts splated on the window and made a squishie noise...i yelled DAMN. lmao he laughed and acted like he was all proud, he then put lil mighty mouse in the trash can beside me so i got up and moved. I told him i was anti-killing-mice. he laughed. what a dip shit! haha ANYWAYS, we got everything filed and all that good stuff and well...my dog is gone, but at least shes not out alone in this world being kicked around..she's warm and taken care of. I hope we get her back, but i highly doubt it. stupid fucker mike. I hope he rots in hell. WELL, while all this is going on with molly missing and us noticing, my dad calls. He wanted to talk to mom about visiting, mom was too upset, so i had to explain to my dad why she was upset and that her and mike were no longer together. he found out only last week in an email. Mom and john drove around the neighborhood looking for molly while i sat on the couch with roberta eating chocolate ice cream, i know that sounds pretty damn sorry but i was upset and i knew my mom needed space. Im not going to mention this to any of my friends, about molly and all. They dont understand, they dont have a piece of paper that says someone who was once related to them cant come within 100 yards of them, cant look at them, cant speack to them, cant do anything that has to do with them unless its through a lawyer or cop. They didnt have police driving around their house every hour to make sure that person wasnt bothering their family. Normal families dont have that shit go on. I'm glad hes gone..im really honestly glad. fuck him. all those years i needed that father figure and he wasnt it, he told me he loved me once and thats the first time i saw him after he married my mom. I didnt love him, but its good to hear someone loves u, especially ur dad and at the time hes all i had on a day to day basis. fuck him. All the times he yelled at me for no damn reason and all the times he told me i was stupid and needed to shut the hell up and needed to be quiet at 8pm when he went to bed. fuck u mike, damn if i ever have anything to do with him again i'll kill myself. It still brings tears to my eyes about how unhappy i was for all those years. Here was this man trying to be someone and something he could never be. He was no where close to being a "dad" to me. I needed one...i really did. I needed that hug when i got home from school, i needed that..i used to always have that until my parents divorced. It still hurts..i swear, divorce on kids is hard. It caused me to not get along with my mom, it caused a lot of anger and frustration, it caused a lot of saddness and depression, and just until 6th grade did i turn out the way i am today. and i still struggle. I struggle to keep the thoughts of the past outta my head, i struggle not to cry when i get an email from my dad telling me how much he loves me, why didnt i have that every fuckin day growing up? I wouldnt classify my childhood has bad or hard..but emotionally draining, yes. Ive never held so much hate against one person as i held for mike. The one figure i needed the most didnt care. I needed him to at least try to be a dad to me. No, instead he screamed and yelled and acted like a total idiot. Those things will never leave my memories but i hope one day i can make peace with it all. I'm just too angry from 6-7 years ago. Damn...several years ago and i still hold that anger. 9 or 10 years ago my parents divorced, and it took 6 years for me to deal with it. I'm glad mike is gone, but it's gonna take a lot longer to get over everything he caused me to feel. fuck fuck fuck i hope he burns in fuckin hell. ok..i feel better...  okay, and today i go to the store with mom and she lets me and bros go in the store and pick out whatever we want to eat for that week, its usually chicken, frozen pizzas, chips and a lot of junk food and nothing thats not usually frozen. WELL, i made myself pick out only healthy things that contained less than 5 grams of fat..haha Instead of my usual 12pack of diet cokes i got a 12 pack of bottled water...instead of my chips i got carrot sticks and baked chips. Everything of mine was less than 5 grams...yup yup...i'm so on the biggest diet kick. i swear its addictive. dont let ur kids diet!! haha I feel like i cant eat anything unless i pop another diet pill or count the calories. At school i tend to forget about my pills or whatever...but i think i'll try harder to remember. oh, and i've been running anywhere from 1-2 miles every other day..yay...haha trying to be more healthy, yup that's me. :D at least i can say im trying..right??
