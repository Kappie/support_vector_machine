It's so cool. Frankie says : Relax. God, now I'm getting all re-obsessed with 80's  New Wave.  Shannno no, you've done this before. All well. I give in.  I read over Bailey's post and agree. I too am neither anti-alcohol or sex. It happens, woo hoo. But for the love of Satan, why can't they do it at home? Personally, I don't think alcohol is the coolest thing in the world.  It's not horrible, but I just wouldn't go and get drunk all the time just to make myself feel all tingly and dazed and stupid. But hey.  If you want to get drunk, go for it.  I just don't understand why people throw their lives away. They just get hooked and they don't understand what it can do to you. I myself think drugs are retarded. So retarded.  No offense to Bailey or Hannah or anyone who is partial to drugs or alcohol, but I just don't see the point.  Anyways, enough with that weird rant. I just spilled coke all over my nicely free whit shirt. Darn. I should never wear white. It was quite funny actually, I slopped down my coke on the end table and it managed to soar out of the can and onto my shirt. Hmm...very odd. Maybe one day I will find an explanation to it.  Well, I had better be off. Just remember what Frankie says:  Relax
