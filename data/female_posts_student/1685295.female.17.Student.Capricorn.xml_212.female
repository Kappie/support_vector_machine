Repressed childhood memories, mmm? ^_^  And we can act out *other* repressed memories come Christmas and trees!  Hope everyone with tests today did *fabulously* . . . or at least didn't pass out while they were taking them.  Dead': Ben and Gabe say hi. Sedgie: Rick says hi . . .what is this, the fellowship of the tall blonde boys? ^_^  And to my dear darling lesbian lovers -  Every night ! ^_~
