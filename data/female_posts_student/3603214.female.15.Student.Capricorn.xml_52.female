This is not some kind of joke You’re just a kid You weren’t ready for what you did  And when the world is on its knees with me its fine And when I come to the rescue I do it for you time after time Everybody seems to be getting what they need, where's mine ‘Cause you what I need so very but im anything but ordinary  I think im trying to save the world for you You’ve been saving me too We could just stay in and save each other  Im anything but ordinary  (ordinary) Im anything but ordinary  (ordinary)   "Vindicated" - Dashboard Confessional *for Tasha*   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  (Chorus) I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  (Chorus)  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current and let me slip away  (Chorus)  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...   And of course, it wouldn't be complete without the theme...   Can he swing from a thread Take a look over head Hey there There goes the Spider-man  In the chill of night At the scene of a crime Like a stream of light He arrives just in time  Spider-man, Spider-man Friendly neighborhood Spider-man Welcome him, he's ignored Action is his reward To him, life is a great big bang-up Wherever there's a hang-up You'll find the Spider-man
