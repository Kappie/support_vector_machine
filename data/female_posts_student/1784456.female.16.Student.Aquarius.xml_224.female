Mmm so I'm just eating them. Mmm. Hehe, and our next door neighbours were throwing out a whole bathroom set, when I got back from piano it was gone. Recon they heard us talking and took it inside? Hmm, do you ever choose to not know some thing? How dumb do some people think we can be. Maybe you just don't want to admit that you know, maybe you shouldn't know what you know so you don't tell any one. Mmm, the smarties are getting to me, usually takes longer than this! Gotta go chop potatoes.
