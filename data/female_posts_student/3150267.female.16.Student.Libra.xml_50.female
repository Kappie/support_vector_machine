To be happy, it starts with a smile!! ^__^ no matter how miserable u feel, smile anyway. Think abt the positive things in your life n smile abt them. then we can make a conscious effort to listen to the words that come out of our mouth, thru editing them when we r unhappy. hehe. when we hear complaints coming out from our mouths, we should stop talking. i believe tt happy is the most important thing in our human life. stay happy n smile always!! ^_^     ~I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances... Philippians 4:11~    ::True contentment is a thing as active as agriculture. It is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it. hehe. interesting sentence huh? take care when i'm gone guys.::
