Today, prefects from other schools like Mayflower Secondary and Ahmad Ibrahim Seondary and more came to gave their support which made me felt very relief even though we had informed them quite during the last minute... I even got to see my previous Prefect Master whom I had adore and idolised since Secondary 1 when I first got into Prefectorial Board. However, he left to become a counsellor after teaching my batch for 1 year... which had made us felt quite sad.... Even though times spent toking and communicating wif him had become veri veri less... but then our relationship is still as close as though he is still our Prefect Master... As my position now as a 2nd Deputy Head Prefect is being comfirmed, it will mean that I will face more work and duties and that i will wanna learn how to cope wif it... Even though there may haf been conflict within all of us... I do not think that I will wanna solve it as the other party had not seem to put in the effort, and that others had hated her/him.... She/He may be in the good books of the teachers... but then she/he will noe that all the tough work had been done by her/his colleagues whereas she/he had been the one whu had been gaining the credit... Truth will one day be out, and the teachers will see wad kind of a person she/he is and that she will one day get her/his punishment for doing all those things that had hurt the feelings of the others... =) ****Happy 15th Birthdae to Bertina Cheong****
