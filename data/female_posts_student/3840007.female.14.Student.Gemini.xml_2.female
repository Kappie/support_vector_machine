I have nothing to do today. It's all rainy and not nice outside so I can't do anything out there..and the only things I can do in this house is go on the computer or read. I finished "How I Spent my Last Day on Earth" by that Todd guy, and it was really good. Now I am reading this book called "Feed." It is pretty cool, it is in the future, and everyone has feeds built into them, they can access any information they want and really fast and stuff. It's all about future technology and everything. They decide to go to the moon for Spring Break, and the one guy who the book is about thinks it sucks. It's a pretty cool book, but I am only on part 1 of 4..so who knows if it will be good. Kay enough about the book lol. Grrr. My father is yelling at me to get off the computer, but I have nothing else to do. I need some friends in Dorchester.
