Still have to look up and possibly (better fucking not have to) add the subsequent history of my cited cases.  Plus, the table of contents and lists of cases and statutes cited should be typed up at some point.  But not tonight.  For now, I'm on the prowl for groceries and dinner.  Woo!  Look out Saturday night!  P.S.  To my fellow briefers:  is it okay that I gave bare-bones explainations of two cases under by B. section of the second issue while using way more than that for rule statements?  Your comments (answers) won't count as discussing the paper after the black-out period, I checked (while wearing a zipper).
