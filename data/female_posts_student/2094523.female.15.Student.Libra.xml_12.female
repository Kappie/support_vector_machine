Then I found out that a friend of myne has been sayin bullshit bout me even though they do not go to my fuckin skool and dotn understand anything about me. To make funa my new friends goes beyond the gawddamn line. Theyre just fuckin jealous coz they have no friends themselves. but bullshit bout me and my friends that arent true is just majorly stupid. Lesson: get ure facts straight before u spread shyt bout me. Secondly when you dont know jackshit dont say anything u fucker. They'll just jealous coz they suck @ life and they suck @ everythin else in between and is nothin but a gawddamn spoiled bitch. And another lesson when someone confronts you bout something u did and u go "uh....no.....no..i uh..never did that..." it doesn't help yourself. So when you lie lie properly and shut the fuck up. Anyways, im cold and hungry and extremely tired and fed up with "friends" i never had....so u tell me how im doin rite now
