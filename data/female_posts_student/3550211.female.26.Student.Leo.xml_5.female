GIVE ME A BREAK ALREADY. at first, i didn't know if hung's first album was a colossal joke. i mean we all laugh when we hear him sing "she bang's" but to give the guy a record deal? why? who would buy his cd? evidently, almost 100,000 people have. that astounds me. i can appreciate this being his 15 minutes of fame and all, but how is this ridiculous scene still playing? i think this joke has been over played. it's not funny anymore. it's just not. to everybody who bought his cd and who plans on buying his next one - GET A LIFE! waste your money on some decent music.  read the  urlLink article  for yourself.
