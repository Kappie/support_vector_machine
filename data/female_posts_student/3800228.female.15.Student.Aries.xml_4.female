We all i can recall of them is 3 guys.. 1 of which i thought was a girl and another which could quite easily pass as a boy attempting to BE a girl... and the other was so unmemorable I dont really care what he looked like. But.. they have grown up now! With a new song called Penny and Me they have a totally different take on music... its no longer Mmmmmmmmmbobping its more of a "tap-your-foot-by-the-fire-and-play-the-ukelaylie" sound.. haha okay enough of the cathy tryin to have a rant like a journalist heres the deal! The one who looked like a boy.. is nw DAYUM fine.. i mean DAYUM... he looks so manly its scary i even thought he was a chick.. ever! and the one who was kind of girl now looks still kind of girly... really freakily defined cheekbones =S and their new song.. its pretty good *nodds* so yes i am proud to say im a bit of a Hanson fan as of this evening! Havent done all that much today.. woke up late.. bummed round on msn and showered! Yay! Sex and the City is on tonight! Berger meets the girls =) i can't wait! Thats enough for now i reckon!  Toodooloo, Aurevoir! xoxo
