Yep....cept I don't have anything to work on....*is bored* Our schedual is so freaking messed up...Smauss!!! The one day we could have officially had class together you're sick at home!  Both third block classes were together today....it was sorta a slver day, so I couldn't get any of your h.w. . Sorry, dearheart.   So school gets our early at like....uhmmmmmm 12 something, so I'm going to rollerblade (YAY!!!!) up to your house and visit you. Hopefully your stomach ache isn't contageous....;)    .....*is still bored*  I think I'm going to go to 'hold the button.com'.....that sounds like a good use of my time....
