I painted the porch and hate tan lines so I did it nude. It felt great and liberating. That's a good thing about living in the country you can pretty much do what you want. Often in the summer I run around either scantily clad or not clad at all, and it feels great. I hate having to wear clothes in the heat, and can't understand it other people do so. M came home today and he can't seem to get away from my anger. When he left for Quesnel last weekend I was mad, and when he came home today I was mad. He just seems so, 'inconsiderate' seems too harsh but he can't seem to put himself on other people's positions. Here's the poem I said I would post, doesn't have a title yet and needs some tweaking::  intersting how so little can start somuch an invitation dangles on your lips as an anxious tooth bites the lower one your expectantly waiting eyes burn  with desire the kitchy cliche must be used I'm afraid They take on an intense flame of all the things you'd say to me speaking with your hands and lips or your voice, the difference doesn't seem to matter our bodies move, edging closer, the wrong and right sides of two magnets push and pull us your lips still wait slightly parted, as if you've just said the most important words of your life If I jump who knows how deep I'll go? I can simply break this spell by looking away then the magical droning of rushing blood in my ears would recede but before the question is asked the desicion hasalready beenmade the negative space between us  shimmers, sifts, contracts, closes, is gone. the questions that hung there  dissapear, smothered, answered. hands fly to my hair dig deep deeper fingers become claws through their need nails dig deep wanting always more wanting the full pallete all the colours, the fireworks, and explosions what is this need? Is it for completion? For acknowldegment? For acceptance? For the unspoken approval, Your all grown up now it's an illusion fingers still fumble in the darkness and selfconsious thoughts and giggles ripple the steamy surface of a constructed widescreen love scene it is sweet nonetheless and even when your hands aren't  insistent claws clutching anymore and when our bodies make a sundial marking the passage and lack of time in its many metaphor forms I already see next time and imagine the question that's not quite a plea for mercy in your eyes I wonder if that decision is already made too.   Today we ate the first potatoes from our garden. I love having a garden. Everyone should have one.
