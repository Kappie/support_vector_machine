I say what I feel and I am made to feel that I'm doing all these things wrong, and I'm making this weird deal out of things, when only I was just wishing the best. Some people just really know how to blow things out of proportion. Bleh, not what I need to deal with. I understand my intentions, that's all that matters.         Sleep well.
