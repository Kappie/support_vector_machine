Let me tell you a story.  So something possesses me to suggest going down this hill...btw I'm riding Rae's brother's crap skateboard. The wheels aren't even aligned right, so they turn whenever they please. And the trucks were like about to freakings FALL OFF. So something possesses me to say "hey...let's go down  that  hill."  Big mistake.  So...heading down hill...start going FAST. We speed up to at least 30 mph. Really. And then...board starts going crazy...wheels are shaking like they are going to fall off. Trust me, I knew that if I hadn't jumped, I woulda freakin had my ass kicked. So...like a moron...I jump the board. I try to run for a while, and then I skid like 5 feet along my left side.  And  to top it off, I rip a brand new pair of pants. So I immediately think "OMFG...MY PANTS...NOOOOOOOOO!!" And I jump right up and see a nice tear in my pants. Suckfest. Didn't care about my knee being torn up or my elbow being torn up. Just the pants. And so I dont know where the hell Rae is and I yelled "Uhhh...Rachel...a word of advice...DON'T JUMP THE BOARD!"  Oh, so lovely. No. Not really.  But can't forget: *Rachel lies motionless on ground, faking to be dead or something of the sort* *Shauna's mangled body stumbles toward her" Shauna: Rachel...Rachel!!!!! Are you dead?!?! *Shauna drags mangled body toward Rachel* *Rachel sits up* Rachel: HAHAHAH...oh my god...  haha. so great.  Well, I'm off to...listen to music or something. Adios crazies.
