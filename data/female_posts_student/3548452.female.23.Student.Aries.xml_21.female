Then, I go into chat, and I say I'm gonna piss a bunch of guys off- which I did, and lo and behold, here comes this girl I dont even know. Her name is Sara. They call her Sara Lee. She says to me, "you're not gonna piss of Rod are you?" And the first thing that runs through my mind is, what the fuck is this girl talkin about.... I hadnt even talked to Rod in days, so I asked her why she would even say that to me.What she says next kinda wierded me out, which stopped me from getting mad immediately. "Well me and Rod are together now and I dont wanna deal with him when he's pissy and he's coming to see his daughter today....." yada yada yada. At that point I get even more confused cause he doesnt have kids. She THEN says, "oh he adopted my 9 month old daughter" and lets me know its the Rod that we both know. At this point, I am still confused as to WHY she decided to tell me all that information, so I wait to ask Rod what the fuck is going on. I asked him if there was anything new and he says not yet. Then I tell him I heard something interesting about him and all he says is "yeah I heard all about that." Like it was okay that his new bitch decided to just try to bust me out or some shit in the chat room. #1- I do NOT under any circumstances put up with chat drama. #2- I do NOT want Rodney nor have I ever wanted him. #3- Even if I did want Rodney, he is a chatter, and it has been proven that they are nasty whores who cant be trusted. I havent met one yet that doesnt lie, and if they havent lied to me yet (or in some cases they dont think they have) it might do them good to know that I remember EVERYTHING we talk about just so I can catch them in a lie. Like the one that my good friend Greg told just to make me happy. First it was, "I dont like sex all the time- barely ever," then it was "I have to have sex all the time." WTF dummy? Well since Rod didnt feel the need to explain to me why some bitch I dont know is telling me all this information about him (which happens to be a HUGE pet peeve of mine- I hate it when ppl try to tell me stuff about others... if they wanted me to know, they would fucking tell me themselves) I came to the conclusion that maybe he knew about it or he condoned it. In any case, why the fuck would he want some chick to tell me all their personal crap like that. Why would she see a reason to tell me, especially. Well since I"m not keeping any secrets here, I will let it be known that I did sleep with him- once and only once. Not something that I wished to repeat, nor did I ever plan on anything else with him. So now I'm pissed. Well in the meanwhile, I go home and get the most wonderful letter I've ever gotten in my life. My wonderful friend David has been around for 4 years but he was with someone. I didnt know about her when we met and we messed around once.. well he went to jail after that and I found out, so we didnt do it again but we stayed friends and kept in touch. I was the only friend that actually wrote him when he got locked up everytime, took the time out to find out where he was and keep in touch with him. Well he told me last week that he was breaking up with her and wanted to see me (not like, date, just see) and so I made him proposal. I'm not opposed to a fuck buddy- especially not one like him. That was the quickest I ever got a letter from him. What he said was even wierder. Totally ended it with Jill since I gave him an inch, and he wondered why I didnt want to be with him... I do but, like I'm gonna tell him, I dont wanna get my heart broke for the umpteenth time. I doubt it will happen though *winks*. To top it all off I got a sex application with my letter *blushes* and so I was all happy yesterday. Then, I got to watch my roommate squirm as not one, not two, not even three, but four guys she had been talking to or dating came in the bar last night, on top of a guy who was tryin to hit on her and another guy who was buying her drinks.... FUN :D I gotta go right now but this is a two parter- I will finish it on Monday! Love yas!
