Mr. Bush has argued that the campaign in Iraq is that kind of campaign, and some administration officials, notably Vice President Dick Cheney, have suggested that there were at least contacts between Saddam Hussein or his minions and the terror network of Al Qaeda. Others have been more circumspect. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in January that no concrete evidence had been found of a link between the Hussein regime and Al Qaeda.  But there is nonetheless wide agreement now that post-Hussein Iraq has become a magnet for anti-American militants of all stripes who are opposed to the American occupation there.   I think this passage, particularly the last sentence, largely misses the point, which is perhaps not all that surprising for the New York Times.  It shouldn't matter, ultimately, whether the current violence in Iraq is the result of forces that were already there or a result of the war on terror reaching into its borders.  This is purely an academic question, and should thus be left to the vagaries of academia.  Our focus, and the focus of the leaders of the worldwide war on terror, should be on understanding the cause only so far as it helps dealing with the problem in the present or in planning for the future.  It is the same with all the 9/11 Commission nonsense.    In other news, the Utah Jazz will be missing the playoffs for the first time in a whole bunch of years.  Sorry, but I'm too lazy to look up the actual stats.  But, some say, and I'd be inclined to agree (though I'm slightly biased as they are my team), that Jerry Sloan should get Coach of the Year.  I have not followed the NBA as much in the past couple of years as I used to (I don't follow anything as much as I used to - I am in law school after all), and the retirement of my very favorite player, John Stockton, and the departure of Karl Malone, did very little to alter that trend this season.  But the fact that the Jazz could come even remotely close to making the playoffs say something about Sloan's abilities.   urlLink David Aldridge says it best :   Losing two Hall of Famers is, um, tough. So is losing one's leading scorer 31 games into the season. Of course, Sloan never allows excuses to enter the state of Utah, so he said he'd coach what he had left. And so he put his Arroyos and Lopezes and Giriceks and Pavlovics on the floor, and the Jazz just kept on winning. To say this is Sloan's best coaching job is redundant; every season since he took over in Salt Lake City has been like this. His team gets the absolute maximum out of its ability, and if it loses, there's no whining about the officiating or lamenting things not done. One of my remaining goals in this business is to get to see a Utah practice from start to finish. I just wonder how Sloan does it.   He will probably not win, of course.  The NBA is all about flash and egos, and that has never been the style of Sloan or the Jazz.  He quietly gets the job done, and I think that's something to be respected and admired, so I thought I'd make mention of it here.    Oh, and, if I'm not mistaken, Sloan's never won Coach of the Year.  Again, I'm too lazy to look it up.  But I'm nearly certain that I'm right.  Assuming I am correct, it's all the proof that is needed that he won't win this year.  If he hasn't gotten it in years past, then he certainly isn't going to get it now, when the team isn't even in the playoffs.  And that's a shame.
