I mean, I really dont see why SOME people did in the first place..It's not as if they actually CARED. In a way, I am sorry for having a Blog. Apparently my thoughts are upsetting people. I think I'm feeling sorry for myself. Wonderful..heh, no wonder. So, this..once again is my new best friend. :-/...Oh well, I liked this one better anyway. I actually like being able to write down my thoughts without people reading them. and Then I dont have to worry about anyone elses feelings. haha..Im so selfish, but oh well. I have to be able to settle my thoughts and shit, so too bad. So I've been thinking a lot lately, and I really love William. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I want to change my name. I feel like I should be someting different than Laura Shedd, because that name is known to so many things, and I want to get rid of all of them. I want to be like..I dont know, nevermind..that was a stupid thought. I got a new e-mail address, finally. CrimsonTears36L@yahoo.com . I need something new to do on the internet. Actually though, I think that I am going to get a new template for this, because I HATE this one. It's so retarded now. Oh well, whatever. I think I should probably go do that now..heh.     ~i am not suicidal, I just need a way to cope~
