My friends were invited to Kristin's birthday party and I wasn't (which is cool because we don't really hang out) so I was gonna have Chris over. But Chris told me Anthony invited him to his bro's grad party and I was like, "Go, you know why..." Then Maura asked me to go baby sit w/ her and sleep over after but the 'rents didn't want me to because I'd hardly been home the past 2-3 days. I was pretty bummed thinking it was gonna be one of those nights  doing nothing . Around 9, I was soo flipping bored! There was nothing good on TV, no one good online, everyone was at some party, I was home alone, I mean come on! So Eddie (my brother) comes home from work around 9:30 and calls my cousin who's up from Columbus because I told Eddie he had called. Like 10 minutes later my brother comes out of his room and he's like, "Hey, what are you doing tonight?" (me) "Nothing." (him) "Wanna come to Matt's w/ me? They're having a big cook out and Uncle Pat and  DAD  should be there..." For those of you who don't know, my parents have been divorced since I was 6.  The last real conversation I had with my Dad was Valentine's Day '97. The last time I saw him was around Memorial Day in 6th grade but all he said was, "Hey, how you guys doing?"  I jumped at the chance to (one) leave this house and do something (two) see my family! I was ready in like 5 minutes...which is pretty quick if you ask me! I even beat Eddie! When I was putting on my mascara I was  shaking soo much ! It was crazy! So yeah, we finally get there. Eddie and I just got out of the car and someone is walking towards us. It was really dark (by the way, we left at 10pm) and this guy (it was either my dad or my uncle) comes up and hugs us and says, "God, I love you guys." I realized it was my dad. You guys, it took me more than 7 years to get that fucking hug. So then I see my Uncle Pat and he says hi and all that. I was the only girl but I was cool with that. There was a bunch of small talk and lots of pictures. You guys don't know how good it feels to be with someone you haven't spent "quality" time with in  7 years ! My dad and my uncle were cooking out and after stuffing ourselves, we started a fire. (I'm leaving out lots of details but it's 1:31 AM and I just got home and I'll tell you the ones I left out in the next post) So I was just sitting in a chair by myself and my dad comes over and starts talking to me. We were talking about his job and then it got kinda intense. He's like, "Hold this flashlight right here." He takes out his wallet and opens it up...inside is a Christmas photo (like the professional, "everyone dress up!" kinda one) of Margaret, Eddie, and me. He's like, "I never stopped thinking about you guys...I missed you soo much." That right there... After all these years I've spent thinking my dad hated me and didn't wanna be a part of my life. That's why I wanted to be perfect, I thought it was I was soo good at everything, he'd wanna stick around and get to know me. This was one of the greatest nights,  ever.  With one hug, everything came together. One hug and I forgave him for all the shit he put me through. He started asking me how school was and what I did and stuff. I told him I was class president and he's like, "That kicks ass!" I told him how I write and have gotten published. "You have to bring me some of those poems! I'll pay ya, seriously..."  Just to have my dad care like that , it was enough to make me cry. I can't say I remember ever crying tears of joy. But this was totally a time for those. Just saying the words "dad" and knowing that I was saying it to my dad! OMG, when he was showing me the picture of me and my sibs @ Xmas time, he started crying! I was like, omg!  He really does love us , he's not just making small talk... OMG! Thank you soo much Kristin for having your party tonight, Chris for going to a grad party, and the 'rents for not letting me go b-sitting w/ Maura!  You guys...I am seriously the happiest I've been in years...no lie.  Good night, more details tomorrow, love ya!
