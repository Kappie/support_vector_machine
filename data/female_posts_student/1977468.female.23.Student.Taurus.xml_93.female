The kind where what I say is none of your frickin business. Where I talk about my emotions.  Wait a second... OOHHHHH, a JOURNAL! Can you sense the conflict?   There is power in anonymity.  What if one day a new link appears on my sidebar? Just another random site... or is it? People might read it and say "what a fanciful dumbass", and that would be fine. But no- with you people I actaully SEE you and you KNOW what I put here. Do you know how scarey that is? Everytime I write something, it can only be as intimate as the person I least trust who reads this page.  People I've never met before.  I have an admiration for those people who just spill there hearts out like hotel mints, everyone gets a little piece of the joy. People like that blogger "Christmas in July". See, I met her once, and she was completely silent. Like...  a mysterious oblisk... ooffff... untapped interaction. It's an identity thing. There's two sides to everyone, there has to be. That blogger and me, our 2 sides are like diametrically opposed. I hold back here, she holds back in person. I think? I have no idea. My point is- it has nothing to do with integrity, its more to do with the context of the friendship.  There's Dave, then there's Dave-Lite. Dave-Lite is what you all get here, half the emotional calories, 95% less fat. If that makes ANY sense...   Here's a poem I wrote last night.   A Still Forest Song    Who’s woods are those? I’ve watched them from these crumbled walls. That soft lit glow, it pours like wine into thine eyes; my mouth aghast, dry and blind. Must I lie so long?	  Chime, chime that song so vile; the flies return unto their piles. Doth day know not of night’s sound reign? 	  Who’s woods are those? For mists roll back and past, illumine. Though erie shadows cross asunder, broke upon the trunks which shield them, the faerie stand beneath such darkness. They chime and lie as I.  Sing, sing the dirt and leaves. They lay framed in perpetuity, for wind has not, or will not blow. 	 Who’s woods are those, and where have I to go?
