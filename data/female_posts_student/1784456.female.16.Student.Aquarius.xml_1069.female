We got most of them from Forbidden Planet! I looove that shop! Seriously it kicks ass! Usually we'd walk around for hours trying to look for stuff, but in Forbidden Planet you find too much so you spend hours in it any way! Yeah! That could so have been phrased better I'm guessing...  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021130/140/dfrih.html  Oh my god that's scary! Geez... imagine finding out that you've got HIV or some thing. Damn scary. Oh, sorry about the randomness. It's just that admazingly I can do a lot of things at once so I surf while I blog. (Not just multi heads, multi computers too!) Yeah... I see how that works but... no. Heheee. I was just looking at foxkids... as you do. And Iron Man's on it! Yeahhh! Some one's bringing ye olde cartoons back from the warehouse! YEAY! Danger Mouse is on Boomerang too and wow I looove them! (Eek. Need to get out more) Check. Ok, I better go. Bisi!
