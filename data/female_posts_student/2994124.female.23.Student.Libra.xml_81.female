Am officially homeless at the moment, staying with Nick and Jo and 4 kids - who all woke me up at 7am this morning by whipping away my duvet and jumping on me. So got them all ready for school and then left for work. Tired already. I am really starting to appreciate it just how hard it is for parents.  Am moving into my new house on Thursday so am afriad blogging may be a little sparse this week.  Have a days worth of blog reading to catch up on too.  Can't believe Debsie is in Canada - NOT FAIR!
