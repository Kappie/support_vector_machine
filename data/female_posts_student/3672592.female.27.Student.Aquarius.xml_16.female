This apartment is righ across from campus I wouldn't have to buy a parking permit and the shuttle stop is just a block from the apartment. They have 3 different size of one bedroom appartments that I get to pick from. I going to day to find out if they gave my appartment away and I have to look for another place. I hope they haven't and I still able to get an appartment in this complex. I would like to move in before school starts so that I can find a job before I start classes. I think looking for a job while I'm in class might be hard. I just can't to move and have my own place.
