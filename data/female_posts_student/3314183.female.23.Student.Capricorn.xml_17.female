Do you still try tolovethe person when all he ever does is to inflict hurt and pain upon you? But is he all that bad? Has he no goodness within him? Probably there is.  But the eyes are still blinded; the ears are still muffled; the heart is still closed.  It is harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God than for a camel to go thru the eye of a needle.  A man ofweak integrity. That's what you are. I'm not perfect. I have many flaws. But i know I hold on to my promises much stronger than you do.  I pray you'dbe a man of greatfaith, walk with the righteous andquit being unequally yoked.  Cos God loves you and I too much to allow us to stay the same.  We were never meant to be. We've started out on the wrong foot but I will still love you as a brother-in-Christ.  Jesus said, "In this world, you shall have tribulations. But be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world."
