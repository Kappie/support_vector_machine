Today was actually pretty good! we had our very last day of volleyball tryouts and i was so nervous! We did some serve recieve drills and some scrimmaging and some hard setting drill after we did our conditioning hour. wee! then @ lyk noon we found out if we made it or not..and luckily i did! I proved to myself that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, and I   couldn't have done it without him! But i wanna congratulate everyone who tried out-make it or not-yall worked soo hard and did such an awesome job! dont give up because there is ALWAYS next year! then i came home and cleaned a lot because kyla had some 30 people over for YoUnG LiFe! except me and the parentals and the bro didnt stay around..we went out to eat @ outback   (yUmMmMyy) and then we went by the mall to exchange some stuff...and now im home and very tired =( and we have practice tomorrow from 8-11 then MeEt tHe BeArKaTs @ 7...woohoo. well im gone! ill write more later! xOxO*        In Christ!,   kRiStA*
