The extra short version, since it is now 3 am and I'm just now crawling into bed despite feeling mildly nauseous all day and being incapable of proper spelling and grammar as a result, is that my grandfather was missing for 8 hours today but is now safe at home and in bed and wondering why the dogs and I didn't come with my parents to his house at 2 this morning once he got back from driving around "sanford" for 6+ hours.  I say "sanford" because that's where he says he was, but we're not exactly sure if anything he says he's even remotely accurate about after the evening my father and I spent in the car driving around apopka with a SCSO deputy trying to locate him.  So since I've determined that every insane, random, bizarre obstacle I encounter as a result of my family must have buried in it some treasure of a lesson which I'm supposed to learn over the course of solving the puzzle, I'm chalking this one up to yet another reason why I never want to have children.  Tonight was not the type of excitement I was looking for, nor has the demon behind this door been completely conquored.  My mother, and as a result my father and I, have a long road ahead of us with dealing with whatever it is my grandfather is exhibiting signs of, and it is not going to be a pleasant battle.    Of course, the eternal optimist in me (you know, the part I get from my father?) looks at it this way: I still have my flaming red hair and Harry Potter comes out on dvd in 2 days...yeah, I know. sleep and good drugs...
