First of all- Alice. Shes been my best friend forever and shes been acting all wierd and then yesterday she said she didnt want to be my friend cause "she didnt want to put in the effort of seeing me when i go to new vista" and "i'm too punk" and "her new friends hate me, so she doesnt want to hang out" and "the fact that im still with dylan makes her sad" even though shes still with Tad and i hate tad and he has changed her so much, but i dont hold it against her. So we were talking, and i started crying, and then she sees lola and goes "OOH, LETS RUN OFF WITH LOLA!" and then runs of, and later gets a ride from my mom.  But all she said really makes me feel useless, ya know? Like our friendship for 10 years means absolutely NOTHING to her. Shes really....cruel sometimes. And she just deals with things in the meanest, most accusing way. Like we all did in middle school. Its retarded. And if I went to new vista, OF COURSE i would still see her. Melissa goes to a school a 1/2 hour away and i see her almost every other weekend. (melissa, you rock my socks by the way!)  but ACCCCKKKKblarglesnot. I need to find some friends who are less damn dramatic  On a happier note- Dylan bought me a ring. Its pretty... it has gold and 5 little diamonds and this really really really pretty jade band. Every time i talk to him i get all melty like i did when we were first dating....lol. He makes me go all stupid. And ahhh...so hot. Yum Yum Yum. I love him. I LOVE YOU DYLAN!   pbthh. It is 8:24 am and i have to get ready to go to school. Poop.  I might write later, all you loyal readers!
