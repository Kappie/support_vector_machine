Me and Nathaniel had a bit of a fun time at lunch because i embarassed the heck out of both of us: Katie: I've almost done the splits twice today because of these shoes! Nathaniel: i don't think i've ever done the splits before... Me: Don't do it, its bad for your sex! Everyone: *looks at me in confusion* Me: omg.....GENDER!!  I meant GENDER!!!! And then everyone proceeded to laugh at me hysterically for 10 mins straight.....especially Nathaniel because of our various inside jokes lol.... We also discussed Spenser blowing out the tires to his car because he hit the curb while trying to kiss Lindsay....haha i am so telling that story to my kids.  She doesn't know where she is right now with Spenser because of that kiss....i've been there, done that...i feel your pain lindsay! During the story, Nathaniel also elbowed me because we have an inside joke about this too....except i couldn't look at him because i didn't want to burst out laughing and make lindsay think i was making fun of her when its not even about her.  haha....but Taylor told me the whole Nathaniel-doing-the-splits-hurts-his-sex thing is going to follow me for the rest of my high school career....oh joy, lol.  Tampa Bay lost last night 6-2....Vinny looked like he was about to cry, it was so cute!!! he's so hott!!!  Me and Niko are sooo on a break until next season.  Brittany and I also worked out a system as to how one of us will own Vinny.  Tampa Bay better win or i might end up sharing or losing Vinny!!!!!  aaaaahhhhh!!!  Btw, in case anyone hasn't noticed already, Martin St. Louis is like the older version of our dear David Ciminelli of Coppell!!!  Lets look at the similarities: they're both short, fast, good players, score alot of goals, have brown eyes with brown shaggy-ish hair and they're so cute!  And the beard thing that they both have at the moment makes them look alike too.  Its crazy!!!!  I swear, look at two recent pictures of them together and you will see the light  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
