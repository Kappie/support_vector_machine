Something about his eyes and the shape of his lips that made him look like he had been pouting. It seemed like he was having a bad day, so I refrained from saying what I've been meaning to for the past few days. I didn't get a chance to go to rehersal today because of band (and the fact that my inner clock was off and I thought it was 5 and not 4) but I'll try to make it tomorrow. Now I'm tired, and will sleep.  mmmmmmm..... sleep
