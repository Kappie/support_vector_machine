I'm scared to show it to anyone though, because it reveals something terriable.  I know that when the person who it's ment for reads it we will have to have a very long, and painful talk.  And I also know that after that talk, I probally will lose a very good friend.  Even if they forgive everything, things will never be the same.  Why do I always have to fuck everything up?  I have extrordinary things going for me, and I screw up every time.  No matter what the situation is, I end up the loser.  And in the end, I feel the urge to come clean.  To push back away, ultimently destroying any type of relationship that I had managed to build up.  It's almost as if I purpously do something wrong every time, just so I can fall back on it.  I hide something, lie about something, or screw up something, so when I start getting too close to a person, I can use whatever I with held as an excuse as to why we can't be friends anymore.  I push everyone away because I get sick of trying so damn hard to keep them their.   Many  people have told me that I am the best friend anyone could ever have.  I'm kind, considerate, caring, understanding, I listen, give great advice, joke around, know how to have fun...  I'm everything that you would want in a friend.  At least that's what everyone tells me.  But it's hard to do and be all that.  It takes a tremendous amount of effort.  And I never see the payback.  I never see any benifits.  I work harder to be a friend then they do, so I always end up feeling burned.   It's funny though how this goes in a circle.  No one else is a great friend to start out with except me.  They need to be able to get close to me before then can start caring as much as I do.  However, I always start out where they are trying to get.  As I become a better friend, I always stay one step ahead of them, which makes me feel like shit because I don't get back what I give.   On the flip side, if I don't start out giving my all, I never seem to get friends.  I've always heard "you have to be a friend to have a friend"  While, I am a friend.  I'm a great friend.  And I do have many friends.  But none are up to par with me.  Now how conceted does that sound?  See, I really am an awful person.  But does stating the truth always mean your awfule?  Now I'm not saying that I am, but hypotheticly, what if I really was better then everyone else?  Would it still be conceted of me to say that I was?  I mean, if it were hypotheticly true, I wouldn't be lying.  But I guess we'd have to get into the matter of opinion.  And who's judging, or counting...  Well, enough thinking for now.  I don't know what to do.   Reveal the poem, or keep things going how they are?  I'll decide later...  ~Ani
