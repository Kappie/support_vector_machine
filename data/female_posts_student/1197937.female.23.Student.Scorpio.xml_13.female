Websites have been set up featuring pictures and advice on how to seduce officers. An average of 400 complaints a month are being filed by policemen subjected to lewd calls from admirers.     One high-ranking officer said the worst time for the calls is from midnight to 2am and he said about 60% are from men, reports The Nation. He added: "If we talk to them for too long they ask us out, and the gay men always talk lewdly. We cut the line and call them back later to warn them not to disturb police on duty."     Police chiefs say the uniforms might be contributing to the problem but officers just have to deal with it.   too funny....
