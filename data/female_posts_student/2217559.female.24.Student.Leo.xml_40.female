I have seated one table right now and I have one more left for 8:25. Then, on to rest for a bit. From there 11:30, I host the midnight buffet. I have to speak into the microphone for 45 minutes talking about the chefs and everyone. I am tired people. Really, really, really, really oh by the way -really tired. The sleep on board is nil to none. I slept last night 4 hours and have been going since 9 this morning. I change clothes 3 times throughout this day. (Formal evening). I am eager to get back to San Diego.  Even embarkation day is one of the busiest for me.   I just met 6 couples for the first time and had to introduce them all. Remembering their names and faces was very tough - especially since I have only their guest card pass to view. Anyway, we are getting a new captain for next cruise. I just heard some rumors around the ship today about the old captain. Apparently, he has a wife in Thailand but has a thing for phillipino stewards. Insteresting. Funny, how everyone knows things but doesn't talk about them very often. I must say this ship and ship life in general is worse than soap operas. These are the days of our lives. My god. So, you are seen talking to anyone and you are suddenly sleeping with them. Weird, huh? I have seen it happen to a lot of the new people already. Fortunately for me,  I am the social hostess so I talk to everyone and people know it's for my job.  Weird. Ship Life it's own entity for sure. Married people who have spouses at home are constantly developing relationships on board. Very strange to me as I think it's just completely wrong. All of the girls on board want so desparately to hook up with an officer on deck 10. Little do they know but most of them are gay. And the others are all yucky and old. The greeks think there are two different lives. One on board and one at home and that they are separate. I just don't think that's right at all. But nonetheless, I just go about my day, doing my job and hanging with my friends.   Anyway, whew.  I have an hour and half to kill so I think I will grab a cup of coffee. Lots of love. Talk to you soon.
