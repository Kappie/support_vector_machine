I know you can’t really generalize anything, but I’m going to try anyway.  ~~  You develop a certain intimacy, being someone’s friend. When someone trusts you enough to tell you everything, you develop a certain love. Consider, for a moment, being told a deep dark secret that of course everyone has at least one of, and knowing that you are the only one told. Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy, does it not? What if your “best friend” happens to be of the opposite sex? How many times do the two friends end up “falling in love” with one another? Or is it really love? Sure, they love each other, but are they in love? What’s the difference? Suppose, though, that they end up dating. Will anyone question them if they kiss in the halls? Will anyone notice their stolen caresses in the darkened passages? What if they are of the same gender? Is it then no longer okay for them to be together?  ~~  So I feel for her, is that so terrible? She loved me, I loved her. It never really disappears, for the emotion remains. But while I know I loved her, was I in love with her? Maybe love isn’t meant to be understood or interpreted. Maybe a girlfriend is just a friend that you kiss. No objection, right?  ~~  So what if I told you that everything said is true. I did love her, and still do. She was my best friend. Assume, even, that a girlfriend really is just a friend that you can kiss. But I am not a fifteen year old boy. Fifteen, perhaps, but a girl. Has your opinion of me changed? Of course. You’re only human, right? What do you know about love?    ~fin~    A/N: A vignette I wrote for Sophomore English.
