To Karina: Yes, breakups suck, and your right ice cream does help. So does vodka, lol.  For anyone else who reads these insanity pleas, and for those of you who've read them, I just wanted to say the reason why we broke up is because of no reason. I know that doesn't make all that much sense and thats why hurt so much. Noone cheated on anyone or what not. At least not that I know of. But I always ask everyone: "Do you think a breakup is harder when there is no reason or rather if there was one?" My irrational answer to that is that to me breaking up for no specific reason is so much harder cause I dont have an outside person to blame. All we can do is point fingers at each other. And yes,I want to blame someone else for the downfall of my relationship because God forbid I did anything wrong.( making my shocked face, lol) My relationship to him was one that just fit together everywhere. You know how you can get when your in a relationship and everything seems just right? Thats how it was for me and him and it lasted that way for 2.5 years. Until all of a sudden we were fighting over the smallest things and it was hard just to be in the same room. We shared many of things together and those memories are etched in my head as if it were stone. So as of last night I started myself on a new round of BOOT CAMP. In this round, ladies and gentlemen I will not call him but only once a day and if he knows that I've called and didnt get my call then it is up to him to call me back. But oh lets just say I call and block my number and he doesn't know its me it does'nt count. What?, I was only kidding about blocking my number. wink, wink. LOL. So yesterday I called no answer so I left a message, and he called back within the hour. Talked for a couple of mins, and then bye. But then he called me later on at night before his beat started and we talked for 30 mins. Woohoo! 30 mins!!! My phone has a timer. And then this morning he called to wake me up and told me to drive carefully since last night produced some major storms and was still going. God, I love him for acting like he cares. So thank you God for letting him think of me and acting on it.
