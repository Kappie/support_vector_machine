Holy crap, I think we bought more stuff than ever this time.  I think I'm starting to get sick I've eaten so much.  And of course to make things worse I started today... arg...  Set up an eye appointment too.  Friday, contacts again!  Yay!  I highly doubt Dad will take me to get my license out here.  So I haven't gotten my hopes up.  I'll never get my license so I better get used to it.  Plane ride sucked too.  I couldn't fall asleep for the life of me.  And I was so tired and uncomfortable.  *sigh*  ooo I need to call Sherri, maybe I'll do that tomorrow.  Well since I just got here, nothings happened.  House is really kinda quiet without Grandpa here...  Ah well, life continues.  And it seems both my families are getting more and more psychotic as the days roll.  So, I will right another time.  Probably after my eye appointment. later dayz
