I'm on my way to WalMart, someone pulls out in front of me while I'm going 45.  Near miss.  I'm closer to WalMart someone runs a red light.  Near miss for me, not the person behind me.  Get to the parking lot of store and this time I'm not so lucky.  You'd think that someone would notice a red fire engine colored Pontiac Grand AM - guess not.  The lady saw me waiting for a spot, gets in her van, and either forgot that I was there or thought she could clear it but she smacked right into my drivers side.  I was almost in tears because she hit me fairly hard.  That's all I need, higher car insurance.  Damn Decatur drivers.  I'm just about to get my car fixed tomorrow and someone hits it!  More money I don't have.     This summer has been more of a get in touch with old friends type summer.  I've been hanging out with Dara a lot.  I've been talking to Sharon, and my old roommate and one of my bestest friends ever, Randi.  I have a lot of friends, and I love them all to death, but Randi has been there for me through probably the roughest times I've had in my life.  She's been the grounded, reasoning person to my sometimes irratic and dramatic life changes.  Her and I met the very first day we moved into Western as we lived on the same floor (THOMPSON 11!!).  We found ourselves in the same English class as well as another friend of ours.  We quickly became best friends.  I remember staying up till early hours of the morning with us (and sometimes Nicole   Sara) in the hallway or the floor lounge just talking.  Or playing that damned card game (sex in the elevator anyone??)    I really miss her and sometimes I find myself even missing her irritatingly perfect logic.  She knows WAY TOO MUCH about me too; hope she never uses it as blackmail.  She knows about all the bad roommate issues, good and bad (and weird) relationships I've been in, my whole saga of the high school years.  Anyhow, I'm hoping to get down to St. Louis before the summer is out to visit her.
