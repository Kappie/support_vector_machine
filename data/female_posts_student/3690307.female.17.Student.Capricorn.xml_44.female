If you are unaware of the duties of the leaf cutter, then let me introduce you to the wonderful world of "bud harvesting": I cut leaves. There's not much more to it really. Well, if there are no leaves to cut, then I weed in the orchard. Why, you ask? To harvest the new growth buds underneath, that can be used in grafting onto "root plants" to make new species of fruit tree. Oh yeah! The research station sells them for big bucks. Pretty glamorous, if I do say so myself. My favourite part of the job is harassing my coworkers.  I work with Craig Peters (who will have his own paragraph), Mike Stelutti, Emily Contrell, Jan Celler (Also a paragraph), and two field-hands, Richard and Michael (PARAGRAPH).  *Sigh* Craig, Craig, Craig. Where to begin? Well, he's the offspring of two particularity nerdy people, Mrs. and Mr. Peters. If you don't know them, be thankful. Lol, as for Craig, well, let me give an example. It took him an entire 3 1/2 mins to lay out wet newspaper. I'll be the first to admit, wet newspaper is not my favourite substance in the world. It's hard to work with because it loves to rip up. But, I think what really repulsed me was the anal-retentive display of smoothing out each wrinkle after setting the newspaper out. Forgive me for my lack of vocabulary, but, the action was so distinctly effeminate. I couldn't take it. Also, for a grand total, he taught us the benefits to playing Dungeons and Dragons, described his various characters he's working on, and different swords that he would love to have. Again, forgive my ignorance, but if you want to make your imaginary character better, then what's stopping you from just saying, "BOOM! My character just earned 100,000,000 experience points for opening that door!". I'll never understand it.  Jan Celler. His name, is not Jan, but is pronounced Yawn. He's originally from England, and before that, Germany. He's 14 years old, but is so hilarious. The first day, he was terrified of me and Lauren, but, after a thorough debate about broken bones, Jan blurted out, "Three toes!"... *Blink blink*. We realized he was adding in his own set of broken bones. Later, after I asked about his family, he said, "One brotha," Yes, he has a British accent. Occasionally, we didn't know what the fuck he said, like when he said, "Toies", for toys, and "Fitee Cen' " for Fifty Cent. Fffft, he's a good guy. With the accent, it's sometimes hard to remember that I'm a human being, and not a cougar. Lol, j/k Eric!!!  HOLY SHIT! Michael. One word, CREEP! Michael proudly pronounces that he is so inter-related in his family, that he is every race. He also says that he is both a High Wiccan Priest, and a Catholic Priest. He has tiger-stripes tattooed on his arms, and speaks in a different voice for 95% of the time when he tells his stories. He is a self-described Sex God, and has invented a new religion around that fact. But all this is not why Michael creeps the shit out of me, although it is sufficiently enough to creep anyone out. Let me paint a scene for you:  I'm sitting in a pile of cut leaves, on a box. Michael, who I barely know, slides his box up next to mine, and starts cutting. Already, I'm creeped out, by how he has invaded my personal bubble. Unsure of what to do, I keep on cutting. Right when I'm about to forget how fucking close he is to me, he speaks. "Did you try out for the Excel job?" He asks. I stiffen. Wft, I think to myself, How the fuck did he know that? I attempt to answer without letting my eyes dart around to find an escape. "Umm, yeah." I said. "Ha! I thought I recognized you! I was there too! Sitting in the corner! Do you remember?" He asks me excitedly. In the corner? Good Lord, where's Lauren, Help! Help! I thought frantically. I decided not to look into his eyes as I answered evenly, "Oh, yeah, right. I remember." At this, he nods. Even that simple movement creeped me out. "I thought I'd see you again!", he giggles. Oh God. He's gonna rape me, I think. I begin to edge away from him. There is an awkward silence, where I am trying to maneuver away, and he tries to word his next creepy comment, no doubt. Like a deer in the headlights, the sound of his voice makes my eyes meet his helplessly. He continues his monologue, unaware of my desperate attempt to escape. "You're kinda cute! Do you have a boyfriend?" he asks. In my mind, I can see myself taking the small tree clippers held in my hand and driving them into my stomach. I blink, and wish that I actually had. I realize that he is waiting for my response. "Uhh, thanks. Sorry, I do have a boyfriend." Thank you Eric! I think, relieved. "Oh, that's too bad. Darn." He says. There is an awkward silence. In this time, I stare at my work, and try to pretend that it didn't happen. WFT! I think, Who the hell says 'you're KINDA cute". That's like saying, "Wow, before the accident, you were kinda cute!". I am sooooo creeped out right now. Suddenly, curiosity grips me, and before I can stop myself, I ask, "How old are you?" His eyes shoot up, and I can tell that he is happy that I asked. "I'm 31!" He says. VOMITVOMITVOMITVOMIT!, I cry out in my head, Please, someone come over! OH GOD! He continues, "I don't look it, eh?" I try not to vomit, by my mind keeps on replaying scenes of me using the clippers to cut my jugular vein. "How old are you?" He asks. "17." I respond, to creeped out to say anything more. Finally, in the distance, I can see Lauren approaching, and the other leaf cutters following. I send her a stricken glance, and she decides to sit between me and creepy, creepy Michael.  EW! EW! EW! Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.   Ew. Yuck. Gross. As the others sat down, Michael launched into a discussion, while I ignored him. But, when he mentioned that he was a sex god, his eyes met mine, and I think that's about the time I was so irrevesably scarred that I died inside.  Anyway, other than the creepers, work is fun. I'm glad to be working again. Tell me what you think about this Michael thing, if I was taking it way to seriously, or if I should be wearing my cervical taser to work from now on.
