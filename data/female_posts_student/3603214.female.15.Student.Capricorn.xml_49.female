I accepted their answers too, though they were often in contradiction and even self-contradictory. I was na√Øve. I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself."  --Ralph Ellison's  Invisible Man
