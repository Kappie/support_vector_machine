But I must say I am annoyed by this blog tool, looks like they fixed the random unable to display this page issue. But I just wrote a blog post for my other blog  urlLink Ziggurs Camp , my everquest character blog, and it ate it! I went to hit publish, and the thing session timed out. grumble, oh well, nothing I can do but be annoyed. I'm at work, contemplating the idea of putting hydraulics on cars, and why they don't put hydraulics on saturns or something. I mean you'd get more bounce in a lighter car :P   Anyway, I apologize to those who read my Ziggur Camp blog, but you'll just have to wait longer for the most current post.   Also of note, Akcron is leaving for a weekend with the family at a family reunion, I won't be going with her because of financial reasons, so I'll be posting all the antics while she's gone ;P honestly might not be much, but you never know what a lonely guy might do :P   Anyway, more to come later on as stories progress.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
