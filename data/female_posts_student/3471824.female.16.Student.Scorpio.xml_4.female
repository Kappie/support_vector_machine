I don't have anythign better to do, so I'm posting. School's finally over, woot woot, and tomorrow (which is monday) I'll get to gloat, since everyone else in my family still has school (those of them that go to school).  I'm going to be dragged along to one of my sister's soccer games today, all the way on the other side of the city. The only thing more boring than sports is watching sports! I swear, I'm going to VEGETATE. Ugh. But nooooo, today's father's day, so we have to stay together today! I hope I can sue my parents for this... We had a party last night. A bunch of hyperactive kids were running around the house, not to mention annoying adults who took over the house and played bad music all night. They probably got drunk, too. And now I'll probably haveto clean up after the obnoxious brats who messed up our basement. Fun.
