Found a great bird bath for $25, it was adorable. Finally got some landscaping done on the house, it looks great! We had my Aunt AnneMarie over for dinner and we got some great cheeses and wines not to mention bread at the  urlLink Artisan Gary's MarketPlace  in Chester. Such good cheese it's dangerous! It was nice to have my Grandmother come visit. She had fun, and we all celebrated John's B-day on sunday, I made  urlLink Pata Choux , and then made that into Eclairs, John's faveorite. Also got him  urlLink Doom3  which is supposed to be good. Then today I stopped by to see Ross and have dinner w/ my mom and grandmother. Dinner was okay, but the  urlLink white caslte  we (Ross John >Ross's friend   urlLink  Awesome this finally came out!!!
