Wow, that was alot of ppl making out. and then later, when they had the Part 2, music and suches, my brother and kristie were doing the sweetest things. and then around 12:30, they went up to bed early. dot.dot.dot. ya well. I think it's safe to say the lamest new Year's  party . if you tell me this is how im going to spend next new years... i might do something drastic.  We went to the Great Indoors the other day. and everyone went off in there own directions. I walked through the entire store and in my head designed everything in 'my house'.  and today i was just standing there and wanted  So  bad to just get out and  walk  somewhere. Not, get in a car and  DRIVE  or stop somewhere at a shopping center and have to get in my car to go somewhere else that ends up being the exact same thing! damnit! i hate this place. even new york is better than this! i want to  go   somewhere. walk out of my door and be able to see it all anywhere, just walk. not buy anything, just be outside, see ppl, hear it all. Free to go anywhere you want easy as it is to walk across the street. it made me sick how much i hate the way we live here. i want to get out of here!!! i can't live like this much longer. having to go through my parents for any and everything. sure they care adn i am their responsibility, and i owe them everything, and they want to know and care about me. but for GOD SAKE! this isn't living. and if you die taking a risk in live, or living someplace that is a little bit more dangerous, then at least you can die fulfilled and happier than drearily postponing the inevitable, bored and miserable!  She, she screams in silence  A sullen riot penetrating through her mind Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self control  Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you ? Are you feeling like a social tool without a use ?  Scream at me until my ears bleed I'm taking heed just for you  She's figured out  all her doubts were someone else's point of view Waking up this time  to smash the silence with the brick of self control  Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you ? Are you feeling like a social tool without a use? Scream at me until my ears bleed I'm taking heed just for you
