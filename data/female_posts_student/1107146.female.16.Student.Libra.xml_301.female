Becca for the first time in the past month of so just imed me and she started off with the topic of relationships and how she's going to keep away from them....yea right. So of course with total disagreement I just listen to her chatter and then she says that I'm in a awful mood and that I should go look at myself because I'm being a monster! I'm not even in a bad mood, well i wasn't then. Anyway she's now going on about how Philip accidently ignored her at this pizza place...I so so so so just want to thank Phil right now, she deserves it some of the spite from it (even though I know Philip didn;t do it on purpose). Hehe so she's finally signing off. YES!! she's off.  Ok so she thinks i'm suicidal...um nope. Josh I'll talk to you tomorrow and Linds....ya call me i don't wan tto bother you. Prayers to all and thanks to jaoh...you're the best. byebye Rosie
