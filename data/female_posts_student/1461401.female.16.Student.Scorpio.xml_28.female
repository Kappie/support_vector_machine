Well, I asked if she would dlay guitar and back me up on this one song and she agreed. Very cool. I would tell you the song, but that would be giving away the surprise. Of course, you'll probably hear about it by next year... but oh well, like I really give a damn. Tomorrow, there will just be one more week of school. Of course, it also happens to be the shittiest week of school. Exams. The school year is all wrong. The second to last week of school should be for exams, whereas the last week should be a total blowoff. You know what I mean? Of course you do. And if you don't, do you really think I care? Yeah, I don't. Geeze. Who do you think I am? You're mom? God, just leave me alone. Bitch.  Ok, that was weird. Sorry about that. Well I'm gonna go before things get even weirder... yeah, too late for that. ~Me
