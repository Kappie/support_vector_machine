I talked to lennon a bit today, around noon or so. he was helping with the yard sale or something and i was cleaning off the porch, so there wasnt much conversation, but there were some good jokes, which i cant remember worth a poop.  Tomorrow we will all go and see shrek!! YAY! another oppurtunity (spell check anyone?) for josh and tierah to hang out! yay! he FINALLY called her today and talked to her.  i was so proud... my little babies are growin up! *tear* the movies will be yet another
