And I asked him what he wanted and he just layed down on the top of the stairs. It's odd. I know he doesn't want to go outside cause he was just out and he can't have any more food till dinner. ...So...I don't know. I call his name and he looks up at me and then he just puts his head right back down. Hm.  Anyways, todays been good. I went to bed last night at 12:30. I woke up at 11:30 but not to my liking. My dad was calling me at work, so my brother had to wake me up and give me the phone. I guess my dad just couldn't wait till he got home to tell me he got me a day for my drivers test. Personally, when I am sleepy and I just woke up rudley, I don't care. And then he goes on to tell me what he wants me to do tomorrow (um ok?) and goes on and on about now what we need to practice with driving. That's nice. I don't care right now. Try back later.  So after my dad FINALLY stops talking, like 10 minutes later, I go back to bed. But now my whole concentration on sleeping is skewed so I just lay in my bed till 12:15. I get up then, and go on the computer to check the exciting email. Yeah nothing that exciting. Austin emailed me, which was nice, and someone from the youth group. Yup. Um, so at 12:30 I decided I'd go back to sleep then I woke up again at 2. I didn't want to wake up but realized that a lifetime movie was starting. It sucked though. Blind woman who can play instruments learns how to see with rich man's help but declines his offer to tour the world to go after her neighbor in romanitc pursuit. Which of course works and everyone is all happy prappy at the end except for the rich guy who got completley screwed.  And I almost broke my new rule. The one I wrote about in a previous thing of these. But I managed. And I'm proud of myself..kinda.  And I honestly don't think this entry entertained anyone at all cause it was pretty boring.  Much apologies.
