She was thrown off the bike, hit the road, then dragged a few more feet. She broke her neck and fractured her skull. When she was brought to the hospital, the doctors said that it was only a matter of hours. She would not make it. It is a sad tradegy.  This happened when the girl was just finishing her high school. Just days away from her graduation and weeks away from enroling college. A youth soul cut short. It happened so suddenly. No one ever expected it. But it did happen. And it makes me think.  This probably would not have happen if: Her boyfriend ride the bike carefully, not speeding, and not trying to cut the traffic from the opposite side because he wanted to go faster. This happens a lot lately. Motorbike riders sometimes do not care about the rule, therefor do not care about their own safety and the safety of the people they are riding with. They cut traffic. They go zig-zagging inside the crowded traffic to find a very tight space, so they could reach their destination faster. Bottom line, they're not careful just for the sake of getting there faster.  She wears the proper gear for motorbike, which is a motorbike helmet. This also breaking the rules. Not that I want bad-mouthing a deceased person or anything. I just thought to point out that this also happens a lot lately. People, the rider and the ridee, wears unproper helmets. I've seen it so many times.  It makes me think a lot. I've been quite upset about the condition of the motorbike lately. They're getting rude and unsafe more and more each day. And when this happens, it just prove it. This is the case, the example.  To all the motorbike riders and ridee out there, please be careful. An extra concern note to the riders. You have the advantage of being the riders, please be careful. The ridee is not going to be as lucky as you are if something happens. So remember when you drive carelessly, you are endangering another person. That you have someone else's life in your hands. I'm sure you don't want to life forever regreting your careless driving.  PLEASE BE SAFE!
