Movies I want to see: A River Runs Through It Pulp Fiction Big Fish finish Office Space watch all of Sex and the City Kill Bill vol. 1 The Passion Love Actually Girl with the Pearl Earring House of Sand and Fog  I somehow think there's more. Well, hopefully it's something to do in the next 12 days. Twelve days! And I haven't started packing yet. Well, that's normal; to do otherwise would be insanity.   Maybe I need to find that rental packet for Harvard. I wonder if they got my forms.  I guess this is what happens when you let me stay at home for a night.
