I had a lot of trouble going to sleep last night, a lot on my mind, and I didn't get to sleep till 2. Wasn't a very good one either, cause I kept waking up, especially around 4. Finally at 6 I woke up once again and this time couldn't get back to sleep. So I layed in bed for a bit, attempted to read my book (another Stephen King...Needful Things ). That didn't work out so I tried to go back to sleep. Yeah that didn't work either. So around 7, I was like "Wait, why I am just waiting around in my room?" So I went downstairs, Cody was very suprised to see me be the first one awake and I gave him his breakfast. Every day worries me though with him now, I remember he used to always get up right away and beg you for the food in the morning, and the sound of his tail against the wall or floor could wake the whole house up. Today I had to remind him to get up. Of course, he's always very happy once he gets his breakfast in and I played with him for a bit until he decided to go lay down. Well that wasn't enough for me, so I went outside to get the newspaper, and Cody came with me and he rolled around in this giant bush that I call his "little house". It really is the cutest thing to see him in there. I go "Where's Cody? Where is he?" and he gets really quiet...and then he pops out all happy. I love my puppy :) So yes, I made myself some pancakes...watched some television. Which by the way, I am really happy I am not a morning person, cause morning tv sucks SOOO much. I was actually frigthened by some things. Like...yoga on the lifetime channel. And STOCKS on E! Weird. So no one woke up till about 8:30, I told my parents my plans and all, I talked to my mom, and then I got dressed and we left the house by 9:30 to go get Sean. Even though...Ehh...I was supposed to be THERE by 9:30. Eh, what can i say? So we get there like 20 minutes later (car trouble and cops) and by the time we get back to my house it's already 10. Sean and I (oo so much correct grammer!) watched a Family Guy episode and a South Park episdoe. And he let me borrow his DVD's on Family Guy. So I know what I am doing tomorrow! Then my brother drove us to the movies. We first saw The Village and let me just say.....THAT MOVIE IS CRAZY! Oh my god. Just crazy. That's all I could say afterwards. That's all I can say now! I'd recommend it highly. We then went across the street and met up with his mom at Ruby Tuesdays for lunch. Yum, chicken fingers. And his mom is very nice and paid for for the lunch. I'm not sure if she likes me though...hmmm...I'll "ponder" on that one later...since you know...the whole condoms incident..Hah. Um, yes then we went across the street again back to the movies and saw Napoleon Dynamite. Wow, was that movie pointless. Pointless but hilerious. So it evened out in the end and I liked it. But oh so pointless. I don't believe there was an actual plot. But, hysterical. After that we had about an hour and we went over to Walgreen where we bought M's. Yeah sorry no visits to the condom aisle this time. Then we went to Panera's and had hot chocolate. Which I would also highly recommend. Very yummy hot chocolate. I like hanging out with Sean a lot, I'm not sure if he likes hanging out with me so much especially today cause I was kinda paranoid and during our hot chocolate I kept asking him if he actually did like me as a friend and not just being nice, or feel bad for me, and etc. etc. Cause I am officialy now paranoid about that. Don't worry, I didn't ..."dwell" on that too long, maybe about 2 minutes, then we talked about other random stuff. I just wanted to at least ask to try to maybe clear my paranoia. And yeah his response helped. We walked over to his mom's work and she drove me home. I came home. I layed in my bed. Listening to Maroon 5. Without napping. Strange. Had dinner. Mowed the back lawn. Played Scene it with the folks. And now I am here. Alone.  It's really quiet.  I think I'll go watch some Daria.
