(Seee...I do care about her...kinda...) But it was my pooooor kitty. I felt so bad for him.  But the after about a minute he was done choking so I petted him and hten he was happppy... :D  It was kinda nice thought because my alarm clock got turned off in the night and I wouldn't have gotten up! :)  The Mall Hates Me...  Seriously...it toally does! I went there last night to get glasses but they were all UGLY!! Then we deicded to go to Nordstrom and all the clothes were UGGGLLY! I mean, Wet Seal had wayyyyyyy better clothes then Nordstrom, which is pretty sad. Then (This is the WORST!!!!!!!) When we were leaving we had to go up the escalator and it ate BERTS LACE!!! Pooooooor poooooor Bert.  Ernie was glad that the same didn't happen to him, he reallly  likes his lace.  SUPERCHICK DAY! teeee hehehhehehe!   :D :D :D  Love el MUCHAS!  (whatever that means....
