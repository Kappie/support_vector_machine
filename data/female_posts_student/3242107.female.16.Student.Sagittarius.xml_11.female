Ok so  since we won district again, we got a bye for our first game. Then we played Belton, and beat them like 4-1 or something I don't remember, and then last night we played magnolia. Yea buddy. Their pitcher and our pitcher are like the best pitchers around. Like ours, megan gibson, got a full Scholarship to Texas a university at college station. And its worth over $80,000. So yea, shes pretty good, well we faced off magnolia last night, and in the 3rd inning they bunted to cilla and she threw the ball to 2nd to get the lead runner out. Well it was a bad throw and they ended up advancing to 3rd. And so there were 2 runners on and it sucked something happened and they scored. Then with another runner on 1st, amanda scarborough came up and hit one over the 210 fence off of megan- her 1st ever- and scored 2 runs. well long story short, we lost 4-0. It sucked major. coach wy called us out to left field so we could have our talk like usual and all she said was" i enjoyed coaching y'all, this is most definitely my best team ever." and she was crying the whole time. Then she left and that made everyone cry even harder, esp. the seniors. so everyone was crying even me and all of our fans just sat there and stood on the sidelines. and then coach meade was like "ok, lions on 3... 1..2..3.." and we said lions but you could tell we were all crying.when we left towards the dugout to get our stuff, everyone was clapping and that made me cry even more. and its not like i like to cry so yea... like when kirby died, i told myself i wouldnt die... and then when the rest of the team around me was crying and i saw drew's lil bro mitch cry, i just burst. it was so sad.  and now last night i was like , crying will make it worse, dont cry. and when i saw becca, megan, jackie and everyone else crying i had nothing to do but cry. while we were waiting to load up in the vans, me and mandi saw coach wy just sitting off in the distance crying. it hurt so bad. we all wanted it bad. and to bring up the mood me and mandi were talking about how we always take a bus to quarterfinals and we lose so we took vans like the ones we had in arizona, and we lost, so next year we're taking charter buses like we do for the 2nd playoff games. ok well sob story over for now... im gonna go eat some cinnamon toast crunch or trix, i havent decided yet....  l8er peoples
