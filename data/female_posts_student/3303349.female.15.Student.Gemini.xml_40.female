I would like to mention that this was at noon when I hadn't eatten anything all day and it was 95 degrees. Finnaly I got her to give up on the idea of waiting for the evil little duck and got her to tell them in the pro shop that we were eatting. So finnaly I got to eat something and i see my father...the tolerable one...and so he comes into eat with us and is ordering as we get our food. I actually ate all of my chicken for once and he is just starting on the main corse as I am done. So I have to wait...doing nothing...while he finishes eating...hoping that then we can go home since i am bored out of my mind. Then my dad leaves with my brother as one of his friends and his mom sit down at the table next to us to eat. Then my mom fells the urge to talk ot them till they fnish eatting their lunch...so by this time I have been there for two frinkingly boring hours...and then my mom got mad at me for being rude...yeah...so that's my ranting story of the day...Not like anyone really cared but it was something to do and a good way to keep getting my paragrah blog entries...
