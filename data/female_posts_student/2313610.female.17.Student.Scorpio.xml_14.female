Yesterday was the last day of school which was boring as all hell... the school part anyway, and today I made up the AP Test that I had missed a couple weeks ago. Technically I'm not allowed to talk about it, so I'll just say that I think it went okay. We can only wait and see though. Damn that.  What I really want to talk about was last night, which was the dreaded and long awaited "G" word. That word being graduation. It was good as far as most graduations go. Was smushed like a sardine behind people who smelled like alcohol, and  watched the class elected speaker, the salutatorian and the valedictorian give their speeches. I knew all three, so it was really a joy to watch. It was also easy to see the difference in level that the speakers were talking on. The elected speaker was speaking to her audience, and it showed in the memories she brought up and the laughs she worked for. The other two speeches were the more classic ones talking about the future, and they spoke on a higher level, which I appriciated. The Salutatorian's was especially good.  Then we watched some of our favorite teachers read off names, including my history teacher, who showed up wearing a fadora and looking the world like he didn't want to be there. It was classically him and my friends and I cheered him on just because it would piss him off. He's my second favorite teacher. My Acdec coach is my favorite teacher, and it as a riot to hear him purposely mess up the names of his former students on purpose, then listen to the people who didn't understand what was going on, and thought it was an accident. I was laughing rather hard.  I also ran into my ex boyfriend there... again. He was as twitchy as ever. WHen he has too much energy, which is all the time, he can't sit still and it amuses me to no end. Fortunately we only talked for a few minutes before the ceremony then I managed to avoid him.  After the ceremony, we all stormed the field and I hugged absolutely every senior I knew, including one of my closest friends. She tried to shrug it off in that nonchalant, I don't give a damn about the world way she has, but I know we're going to miss eachother a lot. I know I do already. She means a lot to me, despite our constant bickering, and as much as she fought it, she became a constat in my life, and the part of me that hates change will very much miss that.   The rest of me is happy for my friends, and so far, I haven't cried over it, which is a good sign. I just wish my fellow decathletes, and more importantly, my friends, the best of luck in their lives. May they prosper, may they never be forgotten, and most importantly, may they live.
