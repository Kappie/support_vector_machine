This time, he tackles how  urlLink his transition from the academic left toward the right came about :   Even the smartest conservatives gradually bent under the pressure. One day, as we held class in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda, a clever fellow named Will who had heretofore passionately defended America against all attacks, threw up his hands and gave up the fight. He was licked. "I guess America really is just for old, white, bigoted males after all," he said, dejected.  Would it surprise you to know that I nearly cried? It certainly surprised me then. Like a freight train at full throttle, the final lines of Pope's Dunciad clattered through my brain:  Lo! thy dread empire, CHAOS! is restor'd; Light dies before thy uncreating word: Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall; And Universal Darkness buries all.  It was the triumph of the Adversary: As an emissary of left-wing academia I had won, and I did not want to win. Now I can see that though part of me thought my students needed a left-wing, anti-American viewpoint, another part of me propagated it because I wanted them to prove me wrong and take their rightful place as American free-thinkers. (Students, if you can't agree with your professors' leftist boilerplate, take heart: Chances are good they don't really agree with it, either.) Of course, this was about as thoroughly wrong-headed as wrong-headed folk pedagogy could get: A teacher should never deliberately present falsehood so his students can discover the truth on their own.  It took me years to figure that one out; I didn't realize any of it then, or at best realized it very dimly. (For a former teacher, I can be a pretty slow learner.) I only knew that I had committed a great wrong, that some reparation had to be made, and that -- since there were about two minutes left in the class period -- I would have to make amends very soon, and quickly. I spoke up as soon as Will finished, and it was with an unexpected tongue of flame:  "No. Not you, Will. If anyone else gave up on America I could accept it. But not you.  "Yes, America has injustice. Every country does. Yes, UVA's founder Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. But he also wrote that 'All men are created equal.' Slavery lost that fight, equality won. That's because America belongs to people like Jefferson who criticize injustice and work to change it, even if they can't always understand what their words and actions truly mean.  "When America sees it's in the wrong it changes for the better. Thirty-three years ago, we didn't have any Black students at UVA. Now we do, and everybody is better off for the change. What's more, our students aren't just Black, but every race and ethnicity imaginable, and they come here from all over the globe. Even Gay students like me have found a place at the table, when thirty years ago or even fifteen, we'd have been unthinkable.  "In other countries, people who speak out against the government are executed. They get lined up against a wall and shot. Gay people like me fare even worse -- we get stoned to death. But here, we've made a national holiday to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King, our greatest gadfly. Ronald Reagan even signed the bill! So Will, don't let your professors hand this country's legacy over to bigots. These people lost the fight over what America is; they're dead, buried and forgotten. The country we have now is something to be proud of, something to defend, something to bring to others who don't have ... this ...."  And I stopped cold. I was running late, unconscionably late; I would make my students late for their next class. Yet none of them had left, and what's more, other students walking past the Rotunda had stopped to listen to me. I had drawn a small crowd unawares. And I recognized the look on their faces, because I had seen it during my Gay-activist days, when I delivered news and information each month to Gays and Lesbians all over Virginia. These students were curious, fascinated, perhaps even hungry. They were listening -- and, unaccustomed to this situation, I didn't know what to do or where to go next. I mumbled an apology for keeping them too long and for making a spectacle of myself, then dismissed the class, a bit ashamed.  "It's okay, Tim," one student said. "You did well."   Please go and read it all.  It is an incredibly moving piece, if not only because it mirrors my own track, though I can honestly say that I was never a leftist.  But I was a sight more liberal than I am today, that is for sure.  I abandoned Mississippi party to get away from a brand of conservatism that I found detestable.  And I still do find it to be so.  And I still get into debates with my parents and other family members over issues with which I disagree with them.  But my parents are not bigots.  I know this now, though I'm not sure if you'd asked me five years ago if I would have answered in the negative, at least not honestly and whole-heartedly.  Now I know that they are merely wrong, and that I disagree with them on a great many things.    Politics has always been a tricky business for me.  I see and hear things, even if they are very minor things that have very little impact on the day to day lives of Americans, that people I would otherwise be inclined to agree with have to say, and their lack of class and their lack of reason, and I find myself unable to get past it.  I suppose I have always seen the world in black and white, and one ill fated and misplaced statement that turns my stomach is enough to turn me off of someone forever.  And in politics, it is very rare indeed to find someone who is always so accomodating and agreeable to my disposition, especially since my own political beliefs tend to cut across party lines and America is a party town.  I have no idea what any of this has to do with what I've just quoted, but it just started coming out, so I figured I might as well type it.  But I believe that my line of thought here is indicative of my difficulty lableing myself a Republican, or even a conservative.  But I believe that if labels must be applied, as they are wont to be, then both of them are closer than their negatives to describing me.  Immediately after September 11, when no other issue seemed important and worthy of discussion, and the kings of the religious right were shot down in their insinuations that American debauchery had brought the terror upon us, I thought perhaps I had finally found my political home.  But now that memories have faded (too soon, I believe) and it is an election year, and other issues crowd the plate, I find myself disconnected yet again.  This is not to say that I do not know exactly how I am going to vote in November, because I do, because for me, there truly is only one issue (well, for me personally there are others, but they are not ones that will any time soon be resolved by the political process).  I think that, despite recent setbacks, Bush and Co. have done a good job addressing the needs of the war on terror, and I certainly prefer them to the alternative.  And I cannot imagine anything happening between now and the election to change my mind, and I say this perfectly mindful that a great many terrible things potentially loom on the horizon.  But so long as this war must be fought, and this is something that will not change by November, then my support and my vote only has one place to go.  Because nothing is perfect - and that includes candidates for President.  There is just more or less perfect for me.    On a lighter and completely unrelated note (only because I am too lazy to post this and create another one), Tim Hulsey also has an  urlLink incredibly funny post on the film  Dogville  .  I have not seen the movie, and I'm not sure I ever will, but this is highly amusing nonetheless.  In order to make this tangentially related, I quote this:   To call the movie anti-American doesn't go far enough: It is just plain anti-human.   He then proposes some drinking games to make the film more bearable.
