I'm babysitting th kids again. i had community service today for seven hours helping mentally ill at a carnival. i have homework to do. i'm dead tired. and i really want to smell axe body spray (essence by the way, not that tsunami one they have.) yesterday my adorable mother took me to go see secondhand lions, which was suprisingly a very good movie. i really did enoy it-- i recommend everyone seeing it. its one of those laugh-one-second-then-cry-the-next kind of movies so it=good. bueno. church tomorrow. what i'll wear? never any idea. i have no clothes, and no winter shoes. i know. i have a sad little wardrobe upstairs. MTV so needs to come to my room and re-furbish it. anyway, i'd better go my eyes are hurting from staring at the computer screen for too long.   jules
