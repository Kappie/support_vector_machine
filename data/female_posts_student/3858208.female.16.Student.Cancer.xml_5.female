At least, Iknow how it's affected us, and the people my family is close to. It's true that some positive cn come out of it, but for the most part it's an extremely negative experience. Things will never be the same around here, or at least not for a very long time. By the time things settle down again, I'll most likely be off to college. So, in reality, things are never going to be how they were last summer, before Mom found out about her cancer. It's a terribly sad thought. By the time Mom's cancer is in remission, I'll be nearly 18 and preparing for college, Chels will be in high school, and just everything else in general will be different. The innocent, carefree part of my life is officially over. I envy people who still have a few years left to be kids. My mom's cancer has forced me to face the creul reality that is our world much too early. I miss the days when the most stressful thing I had to worry about was my grades (still important, don't get me wrong), and the days when a big scary monster such as cancer was just one of those things that you hear about happening to other people, think how sad it is, and go on with your life. Newsflash, for those people, life  doesn't  go on. At least, not like it did before. Cancer changes everything. You realize how precious life is, how easily things can do a 360, how you can never get back the "good old days."   I was in the car, on the way home from Wal-Mart with Mom, and I was thinking about when I was little. I mean, 16 isn't old by anyone's standards, except maybe a child's, but I'm talking about when I  was  a child. It was fun, going back and remembering. Just really thinking about that time in my life - nearly ten years ago. Then, it occured to me. In another ten years, I'll be 26. Chances are, I'm going to do the same thing I did today; look back and remember. Then I thought, but will I be smiling fondly, like I did today? Or will I be sad thinking of this time in my life? If I have a choice, I pick the latter. I do not want to look back on my teenage years, the "best years of my life," and regret what I did or didn't do. I want to get out there and  live . I want to just be a kid.   Easier said than done, however. It's virtually impossible to just be kid now. I may be able to go out and have a blast with my friends and forget about stuff, but at the end of the day, I still come home to this...twisted reality that's bcome my life. I still have to come home and face my personal demons - my depression, just to name one of many. I still have to come home and remember that no matter how hard I try, I will never, ever be able to forget that my mother could be dying. She isn't, but she well could be. Cancer does kill, which is a thought that is scary as f*ck to admit. Plus, there's a 98% chance that even looking back on this time in my life, I'll just get sad.  It's funny. Even though I've been depressed for almost a year now, I never knew what it was like to truely be sad, to be cry-until-your-eyes-run-dry, stay-in-bed-for-days,  hopelessly sad. Until recently. I don't want to really go into what exactly pushed me to this point, but it is possibly the worst feeling in the entire world. Worse than feeling unwanted, worse than feeling let down, worse than a broken heart. It doesn't exactly help that all of these things can lead to being sad like this. I'm still sad, thinking about it now, but it's nothing like how I felt. It's like your sadness is so intense, so very real, that it feels almost like somebody has your heart in a death grip and is twisting...and twisting...and twisting. I'm just extremely glad my depression didn't include that particular syptom, because it is how a lot of people feel when they're depressed. I got lucky (if you can call it that) that although I had a lot of symptoms of depression, extreme sadness was never one of them. Hopefully nothing will ever happen that will change that.
