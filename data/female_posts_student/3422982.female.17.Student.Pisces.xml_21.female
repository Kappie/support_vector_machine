Assuming he doesn't do what he always does, and change his mind last minute.  I feel like crap right now and I don't even know why.  I'm sick of being here.  I wanna go home, I'd have more fun with Nate and Phil than sitting around this shithole doing nothing.  I'm seriously reconsidering moving out here after senior year.  I don't like the neighborhood, I wouldn't trust myself alone anywhere, so getting a job here is out of the question.  I don't know what I'm going to do anymore.  I don't know why I get so excited about coming here.  I just end up wishing I was back at home.  I'm glad Rachel's having fun though, I don't have to worry about her.  I want to do a lot of stuff but Dad just ruins the mood.  I think that's why I feel like crap right now.  I could just sit in a corner right now and I wouldn't be bored because of the way I feel.  I have to motivate myself to type this.  oh well whatever, I'm done. later dayz
