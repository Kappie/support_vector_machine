Okay, well maybe happiness doesn't = chad but it's a good start. I've lost track of time.   Happiness to me can be broken down into these three categories: Plenty of Privacy Being in Good Company Lots o' Music     One thing that bothers me more than anything in the world is not leaving people alone to do their own thing. This would probably fit in the privacy category.For instance, it's ALWAYS obvious when an outsider's commentary is welcome. If there is something I enjoy doing it is almost always ruined by outside influence. It's one thing to ASK for help or opinions, but a different thing to be bombarded with suggestions and demands. For instance, "Oh you are trying that now? Here, I'll go get 20 books from the library and I want you to read every single one from cover to cover and then I'll tell you how to do it my way oh and I suggest you should use that also!" Aww? Really you'd do that for me just so that you can ruin the one thing I'm really starting to enjoy? Thank you!   My day was absolutely delightful. I woke up at 8 and got to Spanish early so I could present my project and leave before class even began, oh the joys of a college class. Then I went shopping oh yes shopping. I know it sounds like a bad idea, but I controlled myself to a point.   Lane recommends: Cafe Vanilla Frap from none other than Starbucks  So after shopping I laid out for a while by the pool, went swimming, yada yada. Watched Chasing Amy. No one cares..   I need to stop writing just to have something down. This is a disgrace.
