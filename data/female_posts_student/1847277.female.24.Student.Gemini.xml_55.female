Work on prelim stuff Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday morning, read for Ling Tuesday night, write practice essays Wednesday morning/afternoon, finish Ling reading Wednesday night/Thursday morning, work on India stuff Friday and Saturday, and then start the whole cycle over again.  But it's really exhausting.  I already feel like I could sleep for days.  I've even noticed that by the end of the week I have the great black circles under my eyes.  Awesome.    In other news I woke up to cat vomit all over the floor downstairs.  Yep, think it's about time to get the carpet steam cleaned.  I hope she's okay and doesn't vomit again, because if she does, I'll definitely have to take her back to the vet.  Yay.
