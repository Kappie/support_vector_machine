I love it as much as Prince of Tennis though the storyline is a bit hard to understand... Strangely, the main character in X resembles the main character in Prince of Tennis.  Hmm...    Kamui, protagonist in X    Ryoma, Prince of Tennis  See?  See?  There DO seem like each other.  *GASP*  Maybe they're cousins (or brothers...)!
