Mostly, a lot of music things, but also a lot of bathing suit things and book things, and even a bit of video game things.   Shall we start with the music, then?   Yesterday was a Tuesday. I know it was a Tuesday, because I have my handy-dandy computer calendar open. Don'tcha hate how as the summer goes by you lose track of the date? I feel like I'm floating in some sort of green jelly. Really. Anyway, back to my point.   Yesterday was a Tuesday, and as such is my 'muzak day.' I had two music lessons yesterday. In two different instruments!! *shock* That's right, folks, I am doing more this summer than sitting on mah bee-hind. In the morning, I had an hour-long lesson with RE, on the harp. (cue long paragraph about hippies and The Bohemian Dream)   RE lives in a barn. That is the nicest way to put it. The first time I went there, it was like: where's the house? Surely he doesn't live in that! But he  does  live in that, and it's actually a very nice that, if rather dusty and infested with ants. Fortunately the ants don't bite. Anyway, we sat outside yesterday, with his dogs and the cat running around like mad (actually one of the dogs just lay down beside me and when I wasn't playing I was giving a very satisfactory belly rub to her ^^;;).  I still have hives :S So, we were sitting outside, hoping it wouldn't rain, and I was just a bit worried how it would go. I hadn't seen him for a while, and I  quit , so it's not like we parted on absolutely wonderful terms (although they weren't bad). He didn't seem to be holding any grudges, and in fact he went a long way to make me feel better about myself and all that (must be that hippy thing). He let me toodle around a bit, getting to know my new harp (more on that next paragraph), and I was very surprised by how much I remembered. I remember lots of songs; how they should sound, little funks I added a while ago, etc. The only thing that're different are my fingers: they don't remember where the strings are! So that made for some very frustrated playing. Also, RE went on and on about modes and transposition and craziness like that. Apparently it's a lot different on the harp than it is on the piano (although who knows why). RE thinks it'll just 'sink into me' after a while, but Iunno. I just hope musictheory.net has some info on nodes and... aiee! It's insane, let me tell ya.   Ok, I lied. This paragraph won't be about my harp, it will be a nice reprieve for your eyes after reading that huge chunk of text. That is to say, I am continuing my narrative on the lesson. Deal with it ^^;; I've forgotten how much I admire the way he lives. He might not be the most sensible guy I know, or even the most musical, but his confidence that that is the way to live is really awe-inspiring. I don't know if I'd ever want to live in a barn, communing with nature and farming for money, but knowing him has really changed my outlook on things. If I hadn't met RE, I coulda turned into one of those all-matching fashionistas who can't get their heads outta their makeup that are so common at CDS!!! I think everyone should meet someone who's like RE. They just remind you to figure out what's important to you in life, rather than what everyone else figures is important. I don't think I'm as down-to-earth as RE, but I'm sure not the frooty-drink type, either. It's just a great thing to be reminded, once in a while.   On to my harp. Her name is Oceans. She's one of his oldest harps, and she's the one that he brings to markets and such when he plays. I don't know what type of wood she is, but she's really dark (I think it's the varnish or something), and  very   slender, delicate and fragile: no direct sunlight, no leaving her standing and no letting strange Muggles play her! *g* Because she's so slender (although very tall), her soundbox isn't that big, and she's very very quiet. For RE, this isn't a problem, because he's fiddled with her to make her able to hook up to an amp. Since I don't have an amp, or have any idea how to hook the thing up even if I did, she'll just have to stay sweet and quiet and all that. *whispers* I don't think he tuned her properly though. I'll have to re-do it.   Ok, I'm done with harps. To the next lesson!   The next lesson was at 6:30, for half an hour, in piano. I'm in GRADE SEVEN now, guys!! One more exam, I'll be in grade 8 and I'll get a credit for it and I'll be able to quit. *cheers* One of the other music teachers in the studio had stolen all the gr. 7 books (grr!), so we had to make do with photocopies, until PN can order some new ones (or steal back the old ones heh). It went well!! For the first ten minutes or so, we talked about my exam and how it went and what went wrong, etc. He already knew my mark, and since it's above the average (72%), he was pleased. Although he did think I shoulda got over 80% ^^;;; I didn't practice my technique enough, what can I say. We haven't gotten the comments back, but I'll see 'em soon. Anyway!! He offered me Rollo icecream, I refused (which I now regret, since we have no good icecream in the house and I miss it). I'm only playing two songs right now, and they're both a bit harder than I'm used to... not so much the fingering or speed being hard, but the rhythm and figuring out when I come in. I've always been a bit weak on sight-reading; what can I say? It was over pretty quick, as the lessons always are -- I'm always surprised. PN and I almost always go 10 minutes or so over the time I'm supposed to be there (I think I'm one of his very last lessons), but since we spend the first 10 minutes or so just talking about what's up, it kinda evens out... *guilty grin* lol.   Today we went bathing suit shopping, just me and mum because shnigga-boom has a drama camp thing she's leading, and anyway N always makes us feel bad when we go bathing suit shopping ^^;;; Not all of us are super-model material!!! Anyway, as you have all probably guessed, not many bathing suits fit me. At least those that aren't in the kiddie section... but, lo and behold, I've got two more bathing suits now!!! I'm sure this doesn't seem much to all you normal-sized people, but to ME, who's been using the same bathing suit for I think two years now, it's BIG NEWS!! I'm actually reasonably happy with one of them, too. You know, I hate bathing suits. I feel like I'm walking around in my underwear. And basically I  am , because most bathing suits are even more revealing than the underwear I use... *sigh* I am such a prude. I DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO SEE ME!!! My parents did their job too well. Really. I've never been kissed, I hate showing lots of skin and if a boy hugs me I smack his nose off.   heh. Not literally, obviously.   Then we went to Chapters!! Squeeeeee!!!! I got lots and lots of books, and so I'm happy happy happy. Books just make me all warm and fuzzy. Games do too, but those are much more expensive than most books so I don't get them as often. That's ok though. Once I figure out a game, I tend to get tired with it, so that's no good. And with me, I either figure out the game super-fast, or I can't figure it out at all and it bugs the hell outta me. Either way, I quit ^^;;; I have very little willpower, I'm thinking.   Finally, the game things!! A while ago, my dad and I got a few more PS2 games. Unfortunately, since my dad was there, all the games were HIS types of games. ie, racing, wrestling, sporting. *groans* Stupid dad. So anyway, we were playing the racing game last night (I forget the name, sorry people, but it seems pretty cool), and I totally beat him!! My dad is such a bad driver!!! ^^;;;; He probably doesn't appreciate me announcing this over me blog, but this is what happens when you can't figure out how to turn when it says you have to turn!!!! =D So yes, I beat the crap out of him. He made me restart every time I got too far ahead, though... hehehe. You wouldn't believe how much that made my mum laugh when she found out. Wow. Seems like all I do in this family is bring hilarity. I don't mind, of course, except it bothers me a bit when I don't understand what's so funny but end up laughing anyway. Feels like I'm being manipulated or something.    Maybe I should be a clown when I grow up!   hehehehehe....   Nah, clowns wear too much makeup. I haven't worn like any makeup since the summer started. It's kinda strange, actually. I've gone out all these times, makeup-less. Last year I woulda died before I did that. It's not that I've gotten any prettier; I've just kinda resigned myself to my fate. I will be ugly GRACEFULLY!! Mwahaha!!! *smites everyone to death*   Sorry, guys. Couldn't resist.
