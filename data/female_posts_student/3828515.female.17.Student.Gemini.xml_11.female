Anyways, I went out to lunch with my dad and my brother, and after that I took my driver's test and passed! I know, finally! Woot. But it sucks because they weren't giving out licenses today because the computer system was down throughout the state, so I have to go back another day and get my actual license. After that, I went out to play tennis with my dad. That was fun. And that's all.     Last song I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster .    Last meal I ate:  Italian beef with mozzarella cheese and hot peppers and cheese fries. Yum yum.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I found a chemistry grade slip of mine... Heheheh... I so dominated in that class :P.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.    Favorite song today:   Still Fighting It  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Italian beef.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Passed my driver's test and played tennis.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I do not remember.
