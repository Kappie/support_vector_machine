I'm updating a contact list, and making mailing labels...but once I'm done with that I have nothing to do until I leave in a couple weeks. I must say, it's nice not having to worry about work and such, but I can't just sit here and do nothing. It would be wrong to get paid for literally sitting here and doing nothing.   I've discovered NPR on WMP...mainly because there are very few other streaming radio shows or playlists that work on WMP 7 for a Mac. Oh if only I had Mac OS X, but that would make this computer run SO SLOW it's not even humorous.   My mom admitted that she's being really harsh about her reactions to me still talking to Ed. We're going to discuss it later. Maybe it will be a step in the right direction. I hope so. This is the only thing we fight about anymore, and I don't like to. But I won't back down. He's my friend, I won't  give him up just because she's holding a grudge towards him. If she has an issue with him, she should call him and settle it, not punish me for it. He's never treated me badly, atleast not intentionally.   *sigh*  I hope it all ends up okay.   Anyhow, back to my contact list. Oh joyous.
