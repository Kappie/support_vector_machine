I woke up this morning at 6:13am and fought with myself to get out of bed around 6:35, stumbled downstairs and made myself a  bowl of corn flakes and soy milk .  I hopped into the shower,  scrub scrub scrub wash wash wash  got out and had only 15 minutes to do my hair, put on my makeup, and get dressed. I thought that I was looking pretty snappy. I walked my little butt across campus to Padnos to sign in at 7:50 somewhere on the second floor. I walk around clop clop clopping in my cute changing color mood tongued brown shoes. I decided to walk into the classroom that I had been assigned to through an email message.  Talk to the older gentleman in the front only to find that he was indeed a professor and I had just walked into his discussion lecture. So after walking around the rest of the second floor, I went up to the third floor. No one was there, but I did see a sign posted that caught my eye.  SSD (Student Scholarship Day) is on April 7th. I looked at my watch only to find that today is indeed April 6th. One month after I turned 23 I go and do something stupid. I knew that I had something to do on wednesday but for the past week I couldn't remember what it was.  So now I am home in snazzy clothes. I called my Grandma so she could laugh at me. :) And I left a message for my Aunt at work so that she could laugh as well.  I can't believe that I totally screwed over any chance I had at sleeping in this week. Oh man do I suck.  At least I have two things to write up for gpy 100. One's an extra credit lab and the other is a movie write up to prove that we were in class when the professor was not.  Then I have a grammar presentation today...good thing I asked for an extension on grammar analysis #4 or I'd be way on my way to stay in bed for the whole day, hoping that I wouldn't have to grow up.  At 6 I'm going to a free four course dinner, which is put on by the school. It's purpose is to simulate a lunch interview and I'm assuming that I will learn about etiquette and which fork is for use with what dining item. :)  Still trying to find someone to go with though, preferably someone with a car, since it is supposed to rain today and walking up to the alumni center is a 35-40 minute walk at least.
