I got to see 7 of my 9 cousins in that family and they're awesome, i loved them. Adrienne has 3 little boys that are so cute and a girl on the way. Wow that family is huge. Then we drove here to Tyler, Texas. Today we went to this rose garden, then swimming, then to my cousin's rehearsal dinner. She's marrying a mexican named Sergio he's really nice. But anyway the mexicans did the dinner and the drink was tequila! YAYY! I had like 3 glasses but it didn't do much. My younger cousin took one down and said she couldn't feel her arms! lol. Tomorrow is the wedding and its gonna be real pretty. It's about 100 degrees here every day and really steamy but i like it. I'm not even burnt yet.... Well, i just got done working out, haha, so i'm gonna go up to the room now. Wish u were here ;) luv ya
