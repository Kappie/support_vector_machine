I have taken this pic (at the profile) from the Jap Volks website, she is a One off Model. Meaning: Only one kind of doll in this world, and it is only available for the Jap residents. She is a beauty! Initially, I have uploaded a pic of SD13 Michael, he is actually dressed in black gothic outfit and painted in very, red lipstick. I actually prefer Michael pic to this current Nana pic. But, I fear that I will scare off everybody, letting them think that SDs are so scary. NO! They are not! SDs are really, very beautiful dolls created by skillful artists. Hiaz... Better not start a war here, hehe! So enjoy my blog and await for more ramblings of my daily life. To see more pics of my MSD in the future (coming very soon), you will have to visit LiveJournal... Edit: Haha! Changed back the profile pic to my MSD-Marie, Natsumi. I think this pic made her look more mature. But it was not taken by me, I took it again from Volks website. ^ ^
