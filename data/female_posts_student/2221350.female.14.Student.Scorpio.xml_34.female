What can I say about today except that it's back to the old grind((life shattering, pain staking, it's not safe to chew on tin foil while you sharpen your nails on a black board, grind)).  my mother is having a nervous breakdown, and I'm not sure if I should laugh, cry, extend a shoulder, or leave it alone. Her and Steven broke up and then reconciled for a few hours then broke up again. So for the past week or so she's been unwieldy and sniffling and scarce. Every time they "break up" I tell her to quit crying and that they'll be back on in a few days, but this time I don't think that will be the case. All this misery for a guy? I guess that's just my mother. I told her that if she really loved him she would respect his decision and be glad he was happy, to which she replied  "but he's not happy, he's miserable"  "then what's wrong with you being together"  "bla bla bla same reason you can't divide by zero bla bla bla"  "then you have two choices," I said  "you can be happy he's happy, which you say he isn't, or you can relish his misery, either way, you've got a smile on your face"  "you're wise beyond your years." that's one of those things she says to me that I understand but refuse to register, since when is there an age limit on wisdom?  dinner's ready, more in a sec.
