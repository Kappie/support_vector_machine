(don't blame the machines, it's your fault.)  I know he's still awake.  I'm pretty sure, but he hasn't called.  And I can't figure it out.  I can't figure any of it out.  They made me take a test to see if they could trust me on the roads.  How come "they" don't make me take a test to see if I'm emotionally fit to move about with the other so-called "normals"?  I love being heartbroken, I think that's what it is.  I'm addicted to whatever it is.  Some girls get jealous, because I get a lot of attention from boys, of course, I also give a lot of attention to boys, which doesn't leave a lot of room for girlfriends...  They don't understand that it's just as much torture as fun, that I'm getting my emotions dragged through the dirt, torn, burnt, slashed, etc.  I'm addicted to the heartache.  That's why I couldn't stand to be with Brent anymore, because he just couldn't hurt me like I need to be hurt.  He cares so much, sooo much, and is just generally so kind.  He loves me and would sooner suffer pain on my behalf than ever inflict any on me... or allow anyone else to.  Not me, though.  I'm sick, so I'll suffer pain on my own behalf--fuck, it's all I want.  Bridget called me tonight.  Almost as soon as I heard her voice, there were tears in my eyes.  She sent me this picture today, of her artwork from school -- ha! Pasta art practice drills! She is just so amazingly hilarious.  She can take the joke, totally carry it, then hurl it off into oblivion with her own unique twist.  That girl makes me laugh so hard.  I mean, that women.  I have known her since before I can remember (although that could just be a side-effect from all the pot...?) since I was five.  We shared chickenpox -- actually, we tag-teamed the chickenpox -- swapped paintings as retribution, and just generally best-friended-around, wherever we went, for years and years and years.  After so many years of growing up together, we suddenly started to grow apart.  I guess it just happens, especially when one of them is particularly selfish and lazy...boo me.  And Bridget, damn that girl Bridget, found my goddamn blog!  So now I'm half-self-conscious of what I'm writing, though lord knows it's pointless--she's known me this long, she's not gonna think worse of me  now .  So Bridge, I'm glad you're reading -- if you are (did I just hear something?  what was that?) 'cause it's just another 10-page letter on foolscap, both sides.  My hours spent on the phone were followed by hours more of talk.  Mommy can go on forever!  And so can I.  Sometimes, we have these conversations way into the night, and I wonder if it's really just to see if one can't wait the other out.  Har har, Mommy, I'm on to you.  We had a ... 'heated' debate, I mean, discussion, and now I think she thinks I think she's a racist.  Although, I don't think that.  Not at all, I can recognize that a lot of things are different now than they were in her youth, that people's perceptions, society's norms, have all evolved and changed.  And the thoughts of yesterday gave birth to the thoughts of today, so they're still related, they're just different.  I hate when we fight.  I think this is just premieres symptoms, however.  She's uncomfortable with the Anil-situation, she doesn't want me to just displace B like that, with some guy I've just met.  I was trying to explain Ani to Bridge today.  He's absolutely a conundrum.  He is like the brown Dan Van Zant of DotU: he's wicked-hot, totally self-assured, he's got such a  way   about him, it's just enchanting.  He has been (up until recently) immensely absorbed in winning my affections, or at least he rekindled his fire-drill feelings for me after he  broke up with his Jennie .  (Jeepers I hate that name, just makes me want to be sick all over her pretty, blonde little head.)  Errgh.  He called me constantly for a few weeks--it was phenomenal.  I'd be out at sushi with Ky after RLG any day, and I'd feel my cell phone, set to vibe, in my coat pocket, two or three times through the meal.  And he'd leave messages, everytime sounding like his little heart might break into a million pieces if I didn't call him back.  He begged me to let him take me on one date -- he'd pick me up, bring flowers, take me to a nice restaurant.   (Hmm, so I caved.  Where's my fancy dinner, Ani?)   And he'd tell me what great friends we are, how we'd have such a good time together.  And so, things with B fizzled out... and things with A flared up.  And last week, I'd say that we were really doing great, but this week it feels like something very big has changed, and I'm shut out, so I have no idea what it could be.  I told Ky, I've got a bad feeling about this could be.  He invited me back to his place pretty easily, sure just to "hang out, smoke a joint" but how many other girls might feel perfectly comfortable doing the very same thing, only moments after meeting him, like me?  It's not totally improbable that some little chickadee has distracted him, some "younger model" that he can trade me in for.  Fuck, I think I got played.  I think, actually, that I'm just freakin' out.  I think actually that he's just been a little grumpy, a little realistic, and a little impatient, and that I'm grossly misinterpreting all this.  I think that he knows what I know, that this is nothing that's going to turn into SOMETHING, and that what we're doing is just having fun and killing time.  Time we'd rather not spend alone.  So do I fight him on this?  Do I tell him that he needs to learn how to love me or leave me (so that I can leave him later)?    He called me once while I was at work.  I didn't know until later.  Then he called while I was talking to Bridget.  Yeah, no way I'm gonna tell her to hang-on while I go talk to that dipshit.  Nuh-uh, he's not  that  important.  And I'm feeling all mushy-gushy, talking about him.  I don't know, is he a good guy?  A bad guy?  I think a bit of both.  He's for himself, and I don't fault him for it--I'm like that, too.  Maybe it's like two positives or two negatives, and you can press 'em together as much as you want, but they're just not ever going to stick.  But they may have really kinky sex, in the meantime.    What the fuck...he just came on MSN...
