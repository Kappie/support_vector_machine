Maybe first impressions are to keep us from trusting "wolves in sheeps' clothing."   At first, I didn't like a lot of people, and in the end, after giving them a chance, I think I was right in the first place. Maybe I should trust myself more to make a quick decision and if someone or something instinctively doesn't work for me, maybe it shouldn't.   I could name a bunch of people who I met and knew I'd never like. Then, with most of them, I gave them a chance despite this initial feeling, and in the end, it turns out I was right.   I feel like I'm a good judge of character. I seem to be right about it in the end, but because of what society and my peers tell me--not to be prejudiced, I give them a chance. In the end, I'm usually right about my first impression.   Thus, I don't trust my body's initial reaction to vomit and purge myself of every memory of the person. I try despite it, and maybe that's wrong.   Maybe there is some way our bodies know better than our minds because they are not influenced by society. Maybe I should trust my instincts more often. Maybe I should stop giving people the benefit of the doubt, but then, sometimes, they deserve it. It's so hard to decide what's right. I guess we can only hope to find a balance between the two extremes.
