Talking about everyday things.  It was nice to see him smile.  But when he is not smiling, he just looks so depressed.  I mean, who wouldn't be in his shoes?  But it just makes me sad.  It is difficult to see someone around your own age suffering and slowly dying like that.  It puts you face to face with mortality.  He has kept himself in good spirits despite the terrible reality he faces.  I admire him for that.      Then I think of his siblings.  Will Alexander even remember him?  Just the other day, JW forgot he had his sister Elisabeth.  His short term memory is worsening.  How difficult it must be for everyone.  I think of how close I am to my brother and can't imagine him in JW's position.  I just can't even  imagine it.    I am dazzled by his parents' tremendous strength and fortitude in these troubled times.  Take Geert, for example.  He says that his typical day is he goes to see JW before work, goes to work, and then comes back to the hospital so that Anne-Marie can go home and shower and spend some time with the other kids.  Anne-Marie practically lives at the hospital.  I just admire the parents so much.    Prayers continue.  For a miracle (there still is always hope).  For a painless death.  For the strength of family and friends.  For the compassion and hard work of nurses and doctors.  For faith and hope to deepen throughout this experience.  I believe in the healing power of prayer, so please keep on praying.
