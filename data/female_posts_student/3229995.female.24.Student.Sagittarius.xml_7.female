ABBA had  an incredible run of chart topping hits throughout the latter part of the 70s and in 1980 they released their greatest album ever,the sublime 'Super Trouper', by many considered the last well-made ABBA album. ABBA was showing new depths on this album, showing them selves capable of making more than catchy pop/disco tunes.    This trend  was taken further on 'The Visitors' and only ‘One of Us’, ABBA’s last single to enter the UK Top 10, is in the fashion of "classic" ABBA. The rest of the album has dark, melancholic undertones and dealing with obscure topics not associated with ABBA. Maybe the most underrated song on the album is the exquisite 'When all is Said and Done' released after the only major hit on the album 'One of Us', 'When all is Said and Done' is a ballad about an ended relationship, but dealing with the break-up in a more mature and reasonable way compared to the 1981 smash hit 'The Winner Takes it All'.     Other great  tracks on this album is the title track ‘The Visitors’ dealing with espionage in the U.S.S.R., ‘Soldiers’  is a song about war and the strange, but catching ‘Two for the Price of One’ which is about dating. ‘Head over Heels’ was supposed to be a song in the fashion of ‘Waterloo’ (their breakthrough single back in 1974), but the cool overall style of the song made it a very melancholic song and totally missed the target. But in retrospect this song has strong qualities    that has been overlooked and deserve a second chance.     Isolation and regret  is two of the major themes on this album, an album that also gives us an idea of what ABBA could have been if they continued recording throughout the 80s. ‘The Visitors’ is one of the most underrated albums of its time and shows that ABBA always gave their best when    it came to quality of their songs.    urlLink The Official ABBA Site
