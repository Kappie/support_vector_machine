Im really gonna miss them. Next year wont be the same w/o them, i mean i only new them for 2 seasons but i'll miss them sooooo much, and friday might be our last practice. Next yr is gonna suck. I mean I was getting close to Kim and Im gonna miss talkin to her. Kim's a leader and a good person and I know a lot of the girls look up to her. I know she'll come visit us, i cant wait to give the shirt lol. Tommy, he's such a nice guy wht can I say. I know i always made fun of him and called him a freak for being so weird all the time but he knows that i dont mean it... at least i hope he does. He's a really smart guy and suprisingly funny... i was not expecting that but i mean that in a nice way not a mean way. I hope they come and visit often b/c im gonna miss them!
