Sure, I am only thirteen and therefore do not understand what love means but who cares? I'm calling like like or lust or whatever it is, love, so there! Anyways, it is TOTALLY depressing seeing everyone around me get girlfriends and boyfriends. It completely bums me out... Why don't I have a boyfriend? I bet no guy in the entire universe will ever like me! This guy named Tristan supposively liked me but he only liked my body, the perv! Jeez, I don't even have a great body! Anyhow, I just want a guy to like me for ME. I don't want some creep that would rather see me in a mini skirt then in anything else more suitable... I just really, REALLY want a guy who appreciates me.    If I had a boyfriend and I could choose his personality, I'd want him to be funny or sarcastic (in a good way), nice, and sweet. See, he'd have to be funny or sarcastic because I really need someone to show me the brighter things in this world. He'd have to be nice because I just don't respect mean people at all... And I don't know but he just has to be sweet. I don't care what he looks like, a guy with those traits is my Prince Charming...    I'm probably asking WAY too much... I am, aren't I? I guess I'm one of those girls that is dreaming for a "Happily Ever After." I'm clueless about the world of going out but I don't really care... I know what I want in a guy and to me, that is all that really matters. I'm pathetic about this entire thing... I'm looking for a guy that I can take things slow with and be with for a really long time. It would be great if I could find that guy now and we could go steady until at least our senoir year in highschool...    Am I a hopeless romantic or what?
