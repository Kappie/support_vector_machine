Find your month  urlLink here  :)   Now before I go on and tear the above description of me to shreds, let me first say HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! May you not be single and have many children.   *ahem* To proceed... Ok, I'll admit that the above description is actually pretty accurate. Other than the love children. I mean, I love children, but from a distance. A great distance, to be honest. I'd be one of those scary little old ladies who spy on kids with binoculars. I remember someone did that to me once; it was not a nice experience.   Another thing I'm not very happy with is 'always making friends.' I am one of the worst friend-makers I know. Instead of acting friendly and open when I don't know anyone, I usually either go mousy (which is what my spirit is :p) or arrogant and cold. Usually both, actually, if that's possible. I hate strangers.   Most of the other characteristics are true, though; I am extremely opinionated, extremely touchy (though I don't think I show it very often), extremely emotional, one of the best liars I know (heheheheheeheheehee), very easily influenced, and very concerned with the state of the world. And I love the arts, literature, and travel. Though not planes; they scare me. And I love my friends; I like to think I'm very loyal. Maybe I'm clairvoyant, too, who knows? lol. I like the outdoors from inside, and fine, okay, I am easily made jealous... though I try not to let that affect my relationship with the person I'm jealous of. Just and fair? Painfully so. I've hurt a few people's feelings that way, I think. heh.   I am also an infamous daydreamer. This may be partly the reason why I failed that math assignment lol. Damn fairies pulling my hair. I also love chatting... and it's a wonderful thing that October people are beautiful inside and out. I like that :) Go beauty! What I don't understand is 'take things at the center.' What does that mean?? I mean sure, I like centering fonts and all, but I'm getting the feeling that's not what they were referring to.   Either way, it's pretty accurate. Thx A for showing it to me :) (And A, stop complaining about my initializing your names hehehee).   Oh, and for Valentine's Day, my beloved parents gave me: a Mickey Mouse purse and a zillion billion hairbands. Apparently there was a sale. I guess spendthrift-ness is hereditary.
