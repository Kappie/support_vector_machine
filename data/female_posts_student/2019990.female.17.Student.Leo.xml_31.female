Then I worked on my english paper, yuck, but it really needs to be done.  And my pastor called to let me know that I am speaking tomorrow about my trip to the Ukriane, to ask for donations.  Which is pretty cool, but I hate speaking in public.  I also went with Wonder Woman to Great Spoons to shop for jewlery.  Now just so you all know, never specifically go shopping for jewelry.  It's a bad idea.  I found two pairs of chandeliers earings and a  braclet to match each.  I love them but I really shouldn't buy so much jewelry.  I did however find a shirt to wear to Wonder Woman's graduation, and to her reception, and tomorrow!  New clothes are fun.  Tomorrow I am also taking Wonder Woman's sunday school class, because it's bacheloriat (pretty sure that is spelled wrong, but I'm too lazy to look it up) sunday, and she has to be at a breakfast for the seniors during sunday school.   Her class is notorious for their "energy".  I am going to attempt to read them a story, and offer gummy bears as a reward if they can answer questions afterwards. We'll see how it goes.  I really should be getting to bed though.  I have to look presentable tomorrow.  Happy May to you all.
