The problem was that I thought it would be a good idea to stick the alarm up in the loft bed with me, instead of down below on the desk where it's been all year. The result was the volume was turned down by my pillow, and then at some point in the morning I knocked the clock down to the grown. It was pretty bad. So now I've missed two classes in a row for Spain and the Americas class. I'm doing so badly in that class. I need to do the reading and write well for the term paper.  So, I made it to my 2nd class, Western history, and wore my new silk shirt from the Gap. It's bound to become one of my all time favorites. You know, the shirt you wish you could wear a few times a week, and if you think you might be seeing different people you'll try to wear it, even if the last time you wore it was yesterday? It's pale teal, button up, silk. For $12.99. I just can't get over Gap sales sometimes. They can be so awesome that it's hard for me to want to pay full price for anything there. I'll just wait until it's on sale.  I rushed to my sister's house in Manteca, because it was her 21st birthday, and I said I'd be there. I totally crapped out on her present, but I bought her a dress at Walmart. I wanted to take her some place nicer, but she refused. She's a stick in the mud like me, only less amiable. And it's only been two weeks since I last saw her, but she is PREGNANT. I mean, there is no mistaking it anymore. She is clearly pregnant. And I'd forgotten how loud she is. Maybe that's where my sensitivity to loud noises comes from. Hmm. We had a nice dinner that I felt guilty about them paying for, then they took me out to see Shrek 2 (good movie, I might add), and I tried to pay at least for myself, but they insisted. I always feel weird accepting hospitality when it's like that. I'm not sure why. And it's not like I'm rich, I'm just living a cheaper life, so I can afford a few luxuries sometimes. I always feel like the rich one when I'm with her, except I never feel like that with anyone else. I feel like a farce. I just spend money on clothes so I look nicer, I guess. And it's not like any of my clothes cost more than $20 bucks. I have one pair of Gap jeans that I bought full price that cost $50. But that's a lot of money to Alex, who seems to be supporting a lot more than she can afford. Those are choices she's made, and I shouldn't have to feel guilty because I've made different choices, such that my life is easier and maybe even better. What can I do?  Then I got anxious (a little bit stressed by being excessively diplomatic for too long) so I came home to Jerm for a night. It was lovely, and made today seem better. Also, I watched the Big Lebowsky again. An awesome movie. Okay, I'm going to bed or I'm going to read, or a little of both.
