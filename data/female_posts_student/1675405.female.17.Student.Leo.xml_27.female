Between UN papers, AP homework and notes, not to mention the exam coming up next Wednesday, and working all day on Saturday and Sunday so I can have enough money to go to Chicago.... Oooh boy.   Tomorrow I kind of made plans with two different people; Marie and Heather. Heather wanted to come over tomorrow and play some tennis because it is supposed to be in the seventies. (Yay!) Marie wanted me to go with her and Greg out to Chinese and then to the Powderpuff game tomorrow night. I kind of want to go with them, probably because I'm partial to the Chinese part of it, but then again, I need to spend more time doing stuff with Heather. She's graduating this year, and I intend to have a blast.  Let's just hope Marie doesn't realize what I'm doing, otherwise she'll freaking pull me hair out.  I'm busy deliberating on what I should write on the back of Wade's homecoming picture I need to give to him... if anything. Ah, I'd hate to be pathetic, but it's too much fun to pass up.
