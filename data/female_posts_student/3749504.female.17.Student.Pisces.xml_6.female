Sheryl Crow's is the only decent cover out there, but it falls short of the original. I love this song, Sweet Child O' Mine.  Anyway...just checking in so you know I'm alive and all :D  Work sucked. My boss hates me, I swear. I hate the manager, but at least Val is NICE to me. Beth, the owner, really isn't that cordial to me. When she sees me she never says "Hi" or "How's it going?" or anything decent, like a normal grownup (you know, those questions that you hate but once they leave you miss...). She made me re-do a ton of things in the rooms, MOSTLY stuff that the other worker did. She's new, and didn't put any coffee cups in  any  of the rooms. And she didn't wash a couple of fridges...and etc...but I had to do it. The stuff I forgot was only in about three rooms, and it was always the soap dish. I'M NOT EVEN AS TALL AS THE DAMN SOAP DISHES, how the fuck am I supposed to see over them to check if they're dirty? Beth has an advantage, she's like 5'8" or so. I'm a measly 5'4". I'm totally serious...I cannot see over the soap dishes. Why anyone crafted the soap dishes so high, I shall never know. What if a kid taking a shower reaches up to grab the soap and can barely reach it and he smacks it accidentally and it flies in the shower and lands on the floor and he steps on it and breaks his back? I'd like to see the soap dish construction worker then.  I'm scheduled for ten days next month! The only advantage is that I get all the vacation time I need to go to Berk and Seattle, possibly even Ashland (a five day trip to each would be very easy to schedule). But that's approximately 25 hours next month, which is ten hours less than I have worked in the past  two weeks . It's obvious that they think I'm a crap worker.  Pretty ironic since the new girl is scheduled almost every day, is slower than I am, and made a ton of mistakes I was blamed for. I like her though. But they shouldn't treat her any different than me just because this is my first paying job (I've worked about ten volunteer jobs over the past five years) and she's worked at, wh00t-de-doo, Best Western and a couple of golf courses cleaning.  But I don't mean to sound bitter :) Oh yea - changed the layout in a vain attempt to make my own. Sucks. I can't work with this system - I had it all figured out with the other journal. Arg. Well, it made my linkies disappear. I shall have them up soon, when I get it in my head not to be so lazy any more...  Well, off to the fair! Should be great fun.
