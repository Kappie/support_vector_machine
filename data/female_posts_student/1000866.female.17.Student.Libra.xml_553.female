I don't even know which schools I want to go to. I have a few in mind but...eh.   Anyway, today was ok. Not a lot happened really. I'm glad tomorrow's Thursday because I always have that good feeling on Thursdays..."only one more day."  I don't feel much like writing again tonight. I don't know why. I think I'm going to go to bed in a little bit anyway so, maybe I'll feel like a nice rant tomorrow. Who knows?  Keep chasin' that rainbow.
