Yes, I have intentionally spelled the word "own" as "pwn".  Counterstrike  does that to ya.  Um...you're leaving...that means....um...  Who's left?  NO ONE O DEAR HEAVEN . I already feel like I'm trapped in a box...the people who are here aren't getting on, the people that aren't here...well...aren't getting on.   "Excuse me while I kill myself" said a very malevolent Lopakka from Sentenced in the song of the same name.   Rehearsals! Well, self-rehearsals...my dumb drummer is about two hours late...might have to find a more dedicated one for the party or we're gonna be scrood.  So...the lineup so far...we're probably going to open with  Rape Me  by Nirvana and follow it with  Noose  by Sentenced....then we're gonna laugh about stuff and make fun of ourselves and the fact that we're all in kilts. And that's it so far. We sort of know what songs we want to do, we just haven't ordered them yet.  Have a great day all, the dumbie just decided to show.
