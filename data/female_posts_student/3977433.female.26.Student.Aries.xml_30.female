My parents asked me if I wanted breakfast..but I couldn't get out of bed. Too much damned wine. Today will mostly be spent trying to remember what it was that went on. haha.  Um, I'm going to clean, play with Gus outside, give the two baths, and then watch Dragonfly. I haven't seen it yet, but apparently it's pretty good.  I'm also looking into taking a trip soon. I"m kind of excited.  I hope that everyone had a great weekend.
