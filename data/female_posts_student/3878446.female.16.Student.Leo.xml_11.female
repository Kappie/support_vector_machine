I'm reading The Da Vinci Code (amazing book so far) as well as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (again)at the moment and after those books I think I'm going to read A Brave New World. I'm a bit of a book worm...If you ever need a good book to read let me know I'm sure I could recommend something to your likes. And feel free to recommend books to e anytime.
