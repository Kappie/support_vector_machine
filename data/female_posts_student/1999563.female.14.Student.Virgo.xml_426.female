Hahha] Except this eye gunk feels really weird. I can't stand it! Haha. At least I look hot, and hats all that matters *rolls eyes*  Maybe I will wear make-up to school on tuesday. JUST KIDDING.  Maybe I will take a picture. Too bad my cameras batteries are dead...*wink*  I am watching this really stupid show on ABC. I don't even know what its called but tis pretty dumb. Ladedodedah.   I wish I had more magazines to cut up. I need to make this science project as PERFECT as stinkin' possible! *w00t*
