I went to a friends house before hand, and she blowdried and straightened my hair. it is so straight and shiney! i then got dressed, and we left. oh, and i/mostly my friends put a little bit of eyeliner on. nothing big. anyway, not much happened. i fell on the spikey grass, and it really hurt. then i called william, because he was "sick". no, no. he was not sick. he was HIDING IN HIS ROOM AVOIDING US. and we KNEW it. his mom had to tell us to stop calling. we then got nacho's and coke and looked around at people. and talked, and said things in spanish. actually, antointette said phrases like "you are a pimple" in spanish, and i would respond after her and point to the person saying, "si!" it was fun, and we now have more inside jokes then ever before. i missed patterson's birthday party, and i feel bad about it even though everyone says that i shouldn't this also screwed up my "seeing smith and patterson for 30- days in a row" thing. great. i SCREWED IT UP! anyway, i feel pretty tonight. i wish i could download some pictures of me, but i can't find the thingy. anyway, i'm going to watch a movie on cleopatra, and study all of the ancient egyptian ways we have learned. Jules thanks mary, it did help.
