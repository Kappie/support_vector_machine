I'm a student, poet, dreamer, romantic, artist, psycho, dork....  I'm sure there's a lot more that I could add.  I have a panic disorder and depression, and I'm very open about it.  I know how much people that weren't afraid to say that they suffer from a mental illness helped me, so I will never hide that part of who I am.  I'm always looking for cool people to talk to, so don't be afraid to im me.  I like making new friends.  hehe      I don't have much time right now, so I'll save the "emotional" posts for later.  (Expect a ton...I'm big on sharing my feelings.)
