YAY!          this past weekend was really very good. the only thing that could have possibly made it better is if nadia and blinkie had been able to spend the night last night. but that is all well, b/c we can do it sometime later. welll let's see...friday i went over to jizzy's for una pelicula (ack! i remember spanish!) and then i spent the night at her house and that was all well. yay for porn night! haha. man those things are stupid. but so darn funny.      and then, when we all woke up, (me being the first at like 10 and jordan and anne at like  1 pm.   .... i had to find various methods of amusement....so i played with jordan's stuffed animals...anyways on with the list of stuff i did:) we started playing uno. nasty brutal uno. haha. the first game like lasted almost 2 hours. haha. and then we ate. and played uno some more. oh oh, and we played disney trivia while watching disney movies. yess. and and then we went back to my house and watched a bootleg copy of sherk 2. haha. AND THEN BLINKIE CAME OVER. and she brought me   THE BRAND NEW INTERPOL CD THAT ISN'T EVEN OUT YET.   because she is just that awesome. and she also let me borrow the virgin suicides. which is a wonderful book. so i'm trying to read like 3 books at the same time. oh yes and i felt pretty productive b/c i read 1/4 of catcher in the rye (and wrote an entry for the first fourth), and i did a wee bit of history. i wish i had done some more. but oh well. that's what today is for! hmm...bad sides were well...my parents weren't too happy with me staying out so much (which is absurd in my opinion) but all of sunday i stayed home. yeesh. and there is even more good news to be related. but i don't want say nething until i see it right in front of me.       AND curiosa is only 4 days away. and that is enough for anyone to be madly happy.     or at leastme.     i've only been at work for about 46 minutes, but i'm ready to go home. haha.     normal ppl would be quite happy at my state and not question it, but I of course, go into a fit of paranoia. why? b/c i'm absolutely stupid and think that in turn for all this good something bad has to happen. no, not like karma. but my own little thing i've got designed in my head.      ack. it's better not to think about it like that. i'll let it go. and enjoy stable contentedness.     yes.
