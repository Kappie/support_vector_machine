They live near my nana which is also very handy and there dad is from Whangamomona, which is in New Zealand. Whangamomona is pronounced "Fongamomona". It's near Mt Taranaki. Most of my family live in Wellington or Dorkland(Auckland) but only the loaded ones live in Auckland. My grandparents used to live in Tolaga Bay on the East Coast, it was cool my nan had a wicked shop. Anyway, I best not talk about that too much or I might start getting upset, which is not healthy when you have a cold. Got to go and get some bread for my "one-eyed Egyptian" TAA TAA.   Meggie got into Maccy.....o.0 weird I don't remember doing the test.....HAHAHAHA Sorry trying to be like Lachlan with his LAME jokes.  urlLink http://www.macrob.vic.edu.au/
