My views are actually becoming clearer in matters of opinion with politics, social sciences, the human race, etc.  With hard-headedness, of course, comes a responsibility: ... Well, I'm not sure what it is, exactly, but I know there's  something .  At any rate, this is where I'm going to put my hard-headedness on display for all the 'net to see! (Yeah, right, that's a bunch of BS--nobody reads this crap anyway.)  So, dare you wander into the deep, murky depths of my thoughts, and witness the shear madness that is my decision-making process?  Hell, even  I 've never witnessed  that , but still..  Well, you get the message.  - Your Insane Wannabe Normal Buddy
