Part of me wants 2 go get pissed and have fun like other teenagers do but the other part of me says no and wants 2 be responsible. I feel very torn between these 2 parts. Maybe its bcoz of my parents, the way they r really strict. Maybe it makes me want 2 rebel, im not sure.   On 2 otha news, im going 2 be doing the deb, hopefully jason will go wit me otherwise i dont know who ill ask. I guess i could ask sum1 from tenison but i dunno. I got sum1 2 go wit mez. She really wanted 2 go and im glad she can now. Things r gd at mount, im glad 2 be away from tenison, i guess i realise now how much betta my time here in mt g ould have been if i hadnt gone 2 tenison. I do misss things, things like familiarity but im getting ova it. The freedom at mount is fantastic tho.  Things r pretty shit at home, i was really unhappy last thursday and i know it showed. i couldnt help it. Ive had a headache since then, i think it mite be from stress. The stress from my parents and evrything thats happening wit them. I dunno wat 2 do. I know there r ppl arround me i can talk 2 about it and that is great but i just dont know if i will. Some1 smart told me that we cannot stand alone. i dont want 2 stand alone but i feel that i ahve 2 this time. I have stood alone b4 and its so hard. I just dont think im ready 2 tell ne1 yet.   Im feeling confused and lost but at the same time happy, is that weird?
