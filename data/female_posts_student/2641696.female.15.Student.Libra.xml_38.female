Something about him was just... spooky... -.- Creed wouldn't be that bad, except for the fact that  we played it all of last year ... like come on!! *sigh* The conductor for that piece wasn't too bad though. She reminded me of the woman from 'Murder, She Wrote.' You know, that old mystery TV show?   UCC was pretty cool. Not as vine-y and old-looking as I thought it would be, but it seemed very athletics-based which is always nice to see. *gag* lol. It was also cool because that's where my dad went for his last few years of highschool. Was looking at the pictures on the wall to see if he was in any of them ^^; I didn't see him though. But he looked different then. He even had long hair!! Ahhh!!   And on the bus ride back... well, let's just say I was ready to kill D They kept getting closer and closer and closer... I can take them from a distance, but once they're in my lap.. eww! No! No! No! I was getting very claustrophobic >   The comp. sci. test went well, I still don't have a debate partner for next week, I'm mad that I missed a grub day, and the cello guy was cute. And I'm done!
