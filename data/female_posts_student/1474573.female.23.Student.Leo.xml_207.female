This means that for each person that comes downstairs I  have to go up, make sure that the room is still intact, check for damages THEN get their key. Thats what I say, but for my *cou-Boss-gh*, it REALLY means finding any and all means to catch them and charge them on the way out. I willfully do not partake. My days are numbered here.  I'm kidding this job isn't that bad, I'm just a bougie lazy, wannbe writer  I'm just mad because I was having this AMAZING dream about vin diesel and I had to wake up........*sigh....oh vin....  anyway more about the amazing,caring, loving vin later........... and his big strong arms  shake it off diane   I've made some decisions as of late. Here they are  1. I'm officially celibate 2. In the next five years I will go out on a date with Adrien Brody, Vin Diesel,and the keyboardist from Maroon 5 ........not neccessarily in that order but most possibly at the same time.... 3. I will move out of nyc 4. I will almost certainly move back 5. I will stop running into my exboyfriends    on the train at 2:30 AM 6. They (my exes) shall here to for stop getting cuter!   back to vin gazing
