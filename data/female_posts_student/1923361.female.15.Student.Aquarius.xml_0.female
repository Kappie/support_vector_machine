I know there is no future in pursuing a relationship with him, yet I still yearn for his love, his touch, his presence.   In conclusion, I am deprived.  It'd be nice to have a guy around again.   That guy shouldn't be him, by, well, everyone's standards. Its not like he's the only guy, or girl for that matter, who has wanted me to be their significant other. Yet I've spent the last two years, from the point of our breakup, rejecting every soul that has the misfortune to ask me out.   This is of course, not to say that I'm nice and likable and easy to fall in love with. I'd see it more likely as they think I'm the type who wouldn't say no to a relationship.  Well, I always tell myself that I wouldn't say no. Because its always nice to know that there's someone out there thinking about you, missing you and yearning for your presence in your absence. And its always nice to have a good cuddle, but thats all puppy love. And as beneficial as it may seem, it is not enough to interest me.  It would also be odd to look for committment at fifteen years of age, because I for one, must admit that committment is one of my greatest fears, and therefore also a task I find close to impossible to complete.   At fifteen, what are the chances of you finding a guy who you can foresee, in ten years time, married to?  Unfortunately, that is precisely the kind of man I want. The kind I want to have a stable relationship and settle down with.   It is not as if I've had many a flings.   Maybe I just need a brother, a really close male friend.  I'd say I have one, or two.   But its not the same is it?   Lol.  Bugger.
