Musicplasma.com allows you to search the discography of your favorite artist and also allows you to find out what other artists you may or may not have heard about have a similar sound.  On a Jay-Z kick?  (Clearly I am.)  Find out what other artists have a similar feel and sound and then who they sound like and who they sound like and the list goes on and on and every artist has an instant discography listed.  I love this site.
