He makes me happy but thinking about it all just makes me more depressed. I realized how much I missed talking to Shaydon. Today in softball all we did was chill by the track (of course noe run) and we talked about stuff and then we did on the bus. It frustrates me to think that I used to be so happy like everyne else I see but now im just kinda..there. I don't feel how long days go by anymore, to me a day is just a day. I was lookin back on Ashley's party, or what I remeber of it lol. Hsd a blast and wouldn't have changed a thing about it. Clint and I went to the strawberry festival..big mistake lol. Payed 9 bucks to look around for 30 min then leave. But we got to talk about random stuff which I guess was good lol, kept eachother entertained. I wrote him a note on how much I wanted us to last and I wasn't sure how he's act toward that but he said he knows we'll be high school sweethearts and be together forever, so in a sense it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Tomorrow is a minimum day thank God, I'm so over school, only reason I go is to see Clint for the sorry hour I do. MAY 28TH!! Almost here, 1 year..never been with someone this long and never been so in love with someone either. Can't wait to spend the weekend with him and just relax..speaking of which, I've been doing that since I got home so I should go and start my hw..later                               OSL
