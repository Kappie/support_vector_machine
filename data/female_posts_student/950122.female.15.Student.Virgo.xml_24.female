Not to mention bum around the house, wake up late and... some other stuff. n_n;;    Sometimes I get the feeling that... I'm disconnected. Disconnected... from something. I'm not really sure. Then I snap back, just like that. It's weird when things suddenly pop into your mind without warning. That's one reason why I hate my imagination.    Speedo-kun! I saw you go online in YM! But it was only for a second or so... n_n; BTW, my Yahoo ID is  the_blacksolstice . Also, your archives don't work... n_n;;   Mikara:  Are you still looking for PS game suggestions? n_n Also, what genre are you into?    I watched  Matrix: Reloaded ! It was so cool! :D
