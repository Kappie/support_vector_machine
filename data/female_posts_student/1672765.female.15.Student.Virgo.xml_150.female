Working in gardens, sitting on their porches in the evening, walking around their lawns, getting their mail, working on a car. I love to see it all.  And I can go outside at this time and still here someone's weed-wacker going.  That's what I like about summer. That's when you see it all. You go down the roads in winter and don't see a soul outside. In fall you occasionally see someone raking or burning leaves but that's just about it. Spring and summer people are outside - gardening, yardworking, enjoying the air, enjoying family or friends. It's great.    Music: All Hell Breaks Loose - The Misfits
