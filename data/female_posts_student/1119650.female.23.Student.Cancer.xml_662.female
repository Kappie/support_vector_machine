You can go in your t's and p.j. pants, you don't have to put on make-up, you can just pull a ball cap over your hair and there is no pressure.  You can just lounge and laugh and there is little to no pretense.  I almost forgot that was possible.    Don't get me wrong: I  love  to get dolled up and go out with my girls for a night out on the town, but there is a different air when that happens.  There is a lot of checking yourself, constantly comparing always in competition although its never spoken; it's just always there.  Last night was a chill night.
