I have tried to unravel the roots of this self esteem issue by digging in every forest that I've ever been lost in...I see everything that is beautiful, warm, attractive, positive in so many people, I see it that shine that everyone has and I'm never afraid of the glittery glare.  For each great thing I find in someone else, I find the one missing memo that completes my own self-loathing file.  It's ugly too, the file feeds off of meeting bigger and better people, so that destroys all hopes I have in moving into higher circles and being comfortable there.  I look around in awe with slumped posture at all the amazing people that grace this planet...I try to emulate their actions, their words, their alcoholic beverage of choice, this only seems more pathetic...I have opinions, strong ones, even regarding the shoes I wear, or the state of the nation, but I'm scared to step away from the crowd with my orange shoes, because me with my stand alone opinions and fashion statements would just be ridiculed...but this is what constitutes leadership and confidence..why should I be afraid to order a rasberry kamikaze, even though everyone is in a mojito/or vodka mood...  I've tried to figure out my faults, list them, methodically (contributing to a very BIG section in the file mentioned before) and "work" on them...this approach works because logistically on paper I have no complaints, I'm professionally, physically, morally, financially, right on the GO on the Monopoly board..but it's in my head that needs "work"...It's like I need to keep playing self help phrases on tape to hear that "you are ok...you don't need to be perfect...you should embrace the shortcomings...you are ok..."
