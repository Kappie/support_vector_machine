(hahahahaha PAPERBOY! i'll tease you forever for that) and his brother tells him that i phoned..(for once)..but..while HE'S ON THE PHONE!! so how do you expect him to phone me back..LOSER! so courtney doesn't care, and runs outta the house not telling his parents that's he's leaving, hops onto his bike and rides over to my house, despite the fact that my parents might've been home, and rings my doorbell..(way to take the risk buddie! see how taking risks is a good thing?haha, i love you for doing this) meanwhile i'm in my house..heard the doorbell.."i don't wanna get the door jul." "well check the window" i look out the window, only to see a very familiar bike..IT'S COURTNEY!!=D!! i run downstairs, open the door and can't help but smile=) drop everything, just to come and see me, not telling you're leaving, just to see me. hehe. so crazy. you were lucky my parents weren't home. =) but even if they were..all you would say is.."hey JO!! LONG TIME NO SEE!!" HAHAHA.. we end up swinging at the hidden park..cuz i hate ppl.=Dand these 3 younger girls came outta the forest, and asked for the time..this is important for later...and for once...COURTNEY HAS MONEY!! we rode to little ceasers to get crazy bread. and when we left..we were riding on the parking lot to leave..and he didn't realize there was a car in front of him, i was going to shout out to him, but it was too late....lol, no he didn't get hit..but the car honked at him, and i passed by the car..looked STRAIGHT AT THEM WITH THE DIRTIEST LOOK EVER..why?? BECAUSE HE WAS DRIVING ON THE PARKING SPACES NOT THE FUCKING ROAD, HE HAS NO FUCKING RIGHT TO FUCKING HONK HIS HORN AT HIM. and so...i shouted that out to the dude driving..hahaha..courtney told me to calm down..but i couldn't help it, it made me so mad! he wasn't even driving on the road!! he was driving through the parking spaces!! then we rode back to mullen to swing on our swings and eat, we see 3 different girls in the park playing..with..woodchips? haha  c.moore-"good, our swings are free" we ride up to our swings get off, as i saw the same 3 girls that we saw before walking towards the park..jO-"let's get our swings before those girls take it"..just then..the 3 different girls that were playing in the park..RAN SO FAST AND TOOK OUR SWINGS!! jO-"..or..not.." i swear...DAMN KIDS, STEALING MY SWING, AFTER THEY KNEW I WAS HEADING FOR THEM. courtney-"i swear they were playing in the sand!!" jO-"more like SPLINTER VILLE! i swear, i would push 'em off just to get them..but..*breathe* i won't..stupid kids..I HATE THEM!" courtney-*yells back as we're riding away* "YOU STUPID FUCKING KIDS!!" jO-"HAHAHAHAHAHHA...see, courtney..i swear at them undermy breath. indirectly, but making sure they HEAR me..you...you jus tswear at them DIRECTLY!!!
