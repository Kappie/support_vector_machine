Please excuse my typing, it's a weird little keyboard. I am well here, and the weather has been mostly beautiful. It's been in the lower 70s and upper 60s today and yesterday so we haven't been able to swim, but it's still been nice. I'll be back in one week (the 14th) but until then, like I may have said, anyone can feel free to call me on my cell! I've read more this week than I have for the entire summer, and I'm tan and happy. This morning, I woke up to the smell of maple syrup, and we ended up having pancakes and sausages. Oh man, it was sooooo good. I don't really have much else to say. Kari, if you're reading this, we all miss you and wish you were here with us (but hope you are doing well on your own) As for the rest of you, I miss you myself, and I hope ya'll are well...as well... So yeah, I guess I'm done here. Good night, good knight.
