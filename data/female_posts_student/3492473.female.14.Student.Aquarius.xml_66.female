I was sitting on the floor next to his computer and he was in the computer chair. He had the screen on but as I came in, he turned it off. I caught a glipse of it and it was  his own blog!  So a few days ago I tried searching for it. Ya know, to see what really happens in my brother's "crazy" life. I needed to make a user name to search and I wasn't in the mood to do all that fun stuff so I didn't. But today I was in the mood. Ha. I found it and read the  whole  thing. First of all, I would never picture my brother sitting in his room and typing in his own blog. I mean he was always the electronic one. Margaret (my sister) and I were always the artistic ones. I'm not saying Eddie can't be but it's just a big shocker. And a lot of the things I read totally hit home with me. Like I understand what he meant and how he felt. Hell, I'm his little sister, and I've known him my whole freaking life. What he goes through and what he feels are pretty much the same for me. But once I was done reading every single post,  I cried.  It was just all so emotional for me. And right now I'm still crying over it. Maybe it was because the first/last post (his first ever but the last one I read) was about my dad. And like just now I realized how much my brother was like a dad for me growing up. He taught me my first word, he always took care of me, we always got along... Now he's teaching me to drive, watching out for me, and now he always tells me if someone messes with me he'll kick their ass. I mean, they're things a dad should do... But I feel like I ruined his life. When he was younger, he could never go out and hang out with his friends because he always had to babysit me. And I feel like he missed out on so much because of me. Family is just a really emotional topic for me. I think the hand I was dealt was a pretty crappy one. I feel like I've had to rise above more shit than half the people in my life will ever have to deal with. And fuck. I'm only 14! How am I suppose to live life and be happy knowing my own father didn't want me to be born? How am I suppose to be Miss Always Smiles when my own dad tried killing me before I was even born? My life has been so screwed up. I have so many memories of running away, jumping out of my window, and just running... I was always scared of cops when I was younger because I saw them so much.  Like at my house.  I have so many memories of all the fights there were, of all the times my dad got drunk, of when I felt like I couldn't go on. This is what confuses me about God. I believe in Him, don't get me wrong.  But how can He just sit and watch all the shit that goes on in this world?  I believe He has control over all the bad shit that happens. I mean He has control over who dies and go to Heaven, so why doesn't He do something about all the crap in this world? Sometimes I'm just so confused by the world. One thing I've always did from when I was little but never told anyone... Have you ever just stood still, closed your eyes, and just saw yourself? As in an out of the body experience. And realized, wow, I'm really a person. I'm living this. This isn't a show, it's real. That doesn't really describe how I feel when I have this trip but I guess words can't describe how I feel. You might think I'm crazy but I already know I  am  crazy. And another reason that prevents me from ever being completely happy...I was an accident. I wasn't planned by my parents. I mean my mom told me most children are accidents but it doesn't change how I feel. Because I know how bad I screwed things up for them. Sometimes I think the world would be so much better off without me here. I feel like I'm just a useless person taking up space on Earth. And I know many people fell that way. Hell, for as many props people give me on my writing, I don't have  half  that  confidence in  myself!  I guess most of the time, my  true  friends are the reason I stay alive. And I mean  true  friends. As in Gretchen, Maria, Kristina, Erica, Mike, and Alecia. And I recently saw the true colors of some people. So that changes my opinion of them. I've had trouble with trust all my life and when people who know how I feel about friendships go and do the shit that kills me inside, I just get this WTF attitude. I don't wanna be friends with people who treat me like a back up person. I'm so sick of people expecting so much out of me and not allowing me to expect anything out of them. You'd be surprise at how much you can find in a person's room or cell phone or purse. Just a warning. You might wanna check some of the shit you have. And OMG! Never lie to my face. Just fucking tell me the truth. I'd prefer the truth soo much more than a lie. I'll be more pissed if you lie to me. But most of the time I can see through the lies. It's my sixth sense. Ah, before I ever become a psychologist, I better go to therapy for a  LONG  time. I sure as hell need it. I mean, look through all my poems. There are probably like 10 or less "happy" poems. And I have more than 150 poems. The majority of my poems are about dying, pain, heart break, cutting, all that. And you'd be surprise at how easily I lie to you all. I hide a lot of shit. But here's my therapist skills going to work. The reason I hide so much is so as to put a shield around myself.  To try to protect myself from ever being hurt.  I've been hurt too many times in life. And if certain people hurt me, I'd pretty much just melt because they are the people who keep me strong. I hope God has some plan where I come out on top in the end after all the shit I've been through. I have things threating my life at 14. I have more than a 75% chance of getting breast cancer. My mom has been complaining of a lump in her breasts. Breast cancer already took both my grandmother's lives. And omg, if my mom was added to that,  I would die.  My mom has done so much for me my whole life. I mean she's great. But I'm a perfectionist and the flaws that she has had in my life sometimes cause me to hate her for them. Then I have the chance of becoming an alcoholic. And alcoholism  increases the chance of breast cancer?  Isn't that ironic? I know I have a much better life compared to many people in the world and I should be grateful for what I have. I am grateful and I do realize that I have it good. But other people have it better and that's what I want. Perfectionist again. I get it from my dad if you can believe that. And abortions... I really don't know where I stand on that issue. Abortions have effected my life in several ways. Well, actually two (and a miscarriage, so now it's three). But I'd prefer not to talk about it. Like I know people who've had abortions and one in particular...she really benefited from it. Like I'm totally against killing a baby who has no control over anything but I feel like it is ultimately the woman's choice. Why does life have to be so confusing? Ahh, I just hope I die happy...Don't worry, this whole post was just a healthy way of getting things off my chest. I'm honestly fine. A little upset but I mean when you think back on your life, wouldn't  you  get upset too?  In the next post I'll put another poem in. Erica was the only one to say anything about it and she said she loved it so that means I can keep adding poems until  you  complain about 'em! Sweet dreams~  Hey. Do me a favor? Start commenting on my posts. I really wanna know what you guys think.
