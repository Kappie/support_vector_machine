Because your heavy breathing (careless nature of a careless human) keeps making things that much more unclear and jaded.  We need a room, a shed to break. Watch ourselves crumble in a room void of anything and everything and nothing at all.  The soul is a barren mystery.  And you are its keeper. But you're blind and you don't want to see.   Struggle for originality and depth, and rise up to lowered expectations that we've set for ourselves.  You're like all the rest, aren't you?  Another crow aching to be like an elusive bluebird .
