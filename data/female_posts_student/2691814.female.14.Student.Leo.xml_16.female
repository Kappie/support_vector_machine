I got Dee a birthday gift ..she's gonna have a party which the era is 50's so i need like a poodle skirt or something of the sort. I think it'll be fun since almost everyone will be there. I actually get to meet Tyler and hopefully Jacka** number1 lol. I've been wanting to meet them forever but i never got to. Anyway, after the mall we went to go meet up with my brother at Vans Skate Park. I thought it was cool to see him doing something other than playin video games or hangin out with David and Kevin alla the time. Since it was his first time skating at the park, he didn't do much so i watched alla the other guys skatebording and  blading. Some of them were actually pretty good thank goddess that i didn't see Jeremy there. I wouldn't of mentioned it to mom anyway if i did see him. But i didn't so its all good. Keith's pretty worn out from skating right now and i don't blame him either. Plus he's back so I'm gonna go.
