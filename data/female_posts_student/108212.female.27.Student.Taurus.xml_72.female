So she stayed home, and we canceled a long-distance shopping trip we had planned.  Did some shopping closer to home, rented  What Women Want  (pretty good, not great), did some gardening, surfed a little, tweaked a couple of songs I'd been working on (maybe I'll post an mp3 when they're closer to ready).  I drop my vegetarian routine for major holidays - so we did some burgers on the barbie, had a few beers, watched our movie, and then, um, well, you know...  Didn't see our kids all day!  Sad in a way, but made for a peaceful day.  Our counselor said (Wednesday night) that she doesn't think we need to come anymore - we worked through the "partnership" issues, sounds like we're to a point where we can handle whatever curves life (and especially life in the form of the kids) throws at us next.  Knock on wood, the garden actually looks good this year - first time!  We put down some really good soil this year, I'm sure that helped.  Daf
