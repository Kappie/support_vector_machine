Road Rally was awesome, i discovered that the mighty Minivan can do anything.  The sophomores were the last group to finish the race.....while everyone else finished around 12:30 we finished at 1:45!!!!!  represent, the night was still young!  then we went to sleep and said some things we couldn't remember.  Here are some quotes from that incident:  Kendra and Kristen: *talking about something* Me: Ok guys thats great now go to sleep     ^ i don't remember saying that!  Me: you guys its after 8:30 Kendra: no its 8:15 Me: no you guys seriously, its after 8:30 i swear Kristen: no! its only 8:15! Me: noooooo i'm telling you.... Kendra: do you have a clock up there or something? ^ lol you kinda had to be there  anyways, the speaker was pretty good....although he was VERY blunt and i didn't agree with some of the things he said, he was pretty funny.  Also, for our service project, we took out 6th graders to dinner and hung out with them for a little while.  Wow, 6th grade girls are obnoxious....i don't ever remember being like that.....i dunno, anyways, they talked about their boyfriends and blah blah blah.  I talked about my 5th and 6th grade relationships to them and how kinda retarded they were.  I don't understand, these 6th grade girls all have these boyfriends and they're all kissing on them and stuf......and then i have no one!!!!  what is wrong with this picture!!!???  haha oh well.  In me and Mary's car, we listened to the Spice World cd by....yes, the one and only....Spice Girls.  They vaguely remembered them while me and Mary sang along to the entire cd.  I will still openly admit that i love the Spice Girls and if they ever have a reunion tour, i am so going to that!  lol anyways, here are some other jokes from Dnow:  Me: and then he's all like "so have you found any new guys" in the lunchline in front of all these people! and..... Mary: you should've said "no i haven't, have you found any new guys? because the girl your dating sure does look like one!" Me: haha then i was all like "no, i think i need to go to a new state or country because Coppell has no selection" and then he says "oh yeah well i know somewhere you could go....blah blah blah and the guy blah blah blah" and then i'm like "Yeah well we're friends now so there..." Nadia: oh yeah! you should've said "oh! we have a relationship because we're friends with benefits now!" Mary: wow nadia! its getting a little steamy up in here! see, i have all these great comebacks that i never get to use ^ all of us on my ex-crush that was on the retreat  Nadia: he obviously said that because he needed a little self-confidence boost before he went to bed.... Me: yeah so he could fly solo.... Nadia: HAHA ^haha girl talk  "I invented this new device called a B.R.A. or Breast Retaining Appliance" ~ Kendra  Kendra: *puts arm over nose* look, i'm David Day!  Sports Update: so stars won on friday 3-1 over Minnesota,  Coppell won 5-2 over Grapevine and i discovered what bitches some of those hockey sluts are.  Allison was being so mean to every slut that walked by, it was sooo funny.  She was on a roll on saying stuff behind their back or loudly enough so they could hear it.  Then she decided to tell us sex stories she had heard about the hockey players......did i want to know? not really.  I refuse to believe some of them because i like pretending that some of the really cute ones that i have absolutely no chance with aren't the manwhores that she described that use girls and get girlfriends to keep around just for sex.  ugh and then she told us this stitches story....yeah i'm going to have nightmares for awhile.  Stars play Edmonton today at 2pm in which i am going to that game because my mom can't find anyone else to go with......even though i'm sick, she's given me some medicine and told me to go anyways. not that i don't want to go or anything, i just don't really feel up to it. its ok, i'll get to see my Emily and Lauren and we'll all have a good time drooling over our fave players like we always do.    Alright i gotta rest up now since i need to make myself better for the game.  hurrah for the new and last tri, ~~~Taylor~~~
