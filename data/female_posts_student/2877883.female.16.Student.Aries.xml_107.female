And I learned that I have said detangler wrong all my life (detanguler). Wow am I cool. So, I am home for the next 2 or maybe 3 days and then it's off to Maine, again. I really need to work on my summer history work. Really badly.       I went to the library today and got some super books. Yeah. But I was also really stupid and I forgot to pick up an application to be a library page there this winter. It'll probably be really boring, but money is money and it shouldn't take up that much of my time, so I'll do it.       I   haven't seen Miss Xarolyn in so long, it saddens me.    Nothing more to say. Later kids.      I really want a watch. A pretty one.
