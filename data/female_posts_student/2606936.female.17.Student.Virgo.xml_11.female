"I wanna be bad, you make it look so good...."  - "if I was Invisible," performed by one Clay AIken. This song is supposed to be all sweet and sad and stuffm, but it's really creepy.... "If I was invisible, I could just watch you in your room..." Obsess much? He also states, "I would be the smartest man if I was invisible," wrongfully implying 1) that invisibility is not only a good idea, but a measure of intelligence and 2) that he is a man.  - "Can I Get Your NUmber?" performed by... um.... wait, let me look that up. Ah, that well-known group known as No Authority.     (?)        anyway, this song goes "Can I get your number, baby? Hit me with the seven digits!" I mean, how European-naive is that? "7 digits?" What about the area code? Hello, welcome to America, land of the free  and  land of the 10-digit phone number..... This is just asking for her to blow you off. But then, if you tell her "I've seen blondes, and brunettes, and some really hot redheads, but I've never seen a girl like you," chances are she's going to blow you off anyway.  - "Hey Juliet" as performed by some group that has a number in their name. let me look it up. Nope, it's LMNT. We'll save the commentary on the name for another post. Anyway, this song is just a little too cutesy and upbeat to use allusions to Shakespearean tragedies.... are we supposed to believe these guys are in a "homeroom class?" Obviously, if they ARE in high school, they've never read "Romeo and Juliet," because he thinks they could just "run away".... This guy watches a girl in homeroom, pages her incessantly, and dedicates songs to her on the radio, all to be eye-rolled... and yet he firmly holds that "You really want me!" Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, honey.  - "Just Got Paid," as performed by N'SYNC. Number one - I doubt a paycheck makes a whole lot of difference to these guys. Number two - they say "ho" a lot. And they don't mean it in a disgusting, chauvinistic way - which can never make for a good mainstream non-Christmas song.  - "E-mail My Heart," performed by Britney Spears. This would be a cute idea for a country song if it was a love song with a computer theme. Actually, Weezer could do it really well, too. And I guess a pop song could do it too..... But it has absolutely nothing else to do with email. She's like "I miss you, I love you, email my heart and tell me you love me" or something. It's just a cheap attempt at being "hip and trendy." Also, they hyphenate "email," which is about the most "I'm so-dorky-i-don't-even-use-a-computer" thing that can be done, unless you are a German, in which case someone decided they could do whatever they wanted to the language, and you can't really be blamed for being forced to spell it "E-mail" or not ever use ÃŸ's. (more on this later....)  - "Heaven," by Live. I definitely thought this song was by some terrible religious-band copy of Matchbox Twenty... I don't know if Live  is  a religious band.... but it's never good when you can guess the next word in a song. Rhyming "believe," "perceive," and "decieve" is rather trite, especially when you're talking about religion. "Percieve" is one of those "big" words they use to sound original. I should knnow, I use it all the time in lit papers. And what the heck were they doing playing a sucky song about Christianity on normal radio?  - "Baby, When the Lights Go Out" by Five. Not only does this song have horribly-disguised sexual subliminal messaging, they also say "second verse, girl" before the second verse, which clues you in to the carefully formed song structure, and how much the guy is waiting for the song to be over... wonder what HE'S planning.
