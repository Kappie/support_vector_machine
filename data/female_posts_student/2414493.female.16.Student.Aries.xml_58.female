The rest of the house kind of smells like durian and stagnant air, neither very pleasant.  I opened up Outlook waiting for recycling bin manufacturers and I get the email from Mr. Francis. It's time for the Leni Fe Bland Auditions again. It's almost like an anatomy app in its lengthiness but this time around I know it's serious: I probably need to talk to Mr. Benson for an application letter and that probably will be lukewarm. And I have to generate a repertoire list. And record a CD. I'll talk to Mr. Francis today, but it's due THIS FRIDAY. Postmarked, at least, which means I'll have to email Mr. Benson ASAP and start recording. It's lame, but I don't know what to play. I have Bach, which should be fine since it's required anyways, but what else? Szumanowski is too short. Ravel was torn up last Thursday...well, I guess I could play it without those difficult technical changes. What else do I have? ooh, Beethoven. Or Chopin. But neither of those were ever top-quality.   Auditions, if I get in, are early June.  Do I want to be doing this anyways? A long time ago I thought yes, this is what I should do, it's another scholarship for college if I get it, but it just seems to come at the wrong time. It's after a whole entire month of all too much piano and right before Bach. Arrrrrrrrrr.  Really really tired right now just because it's hot outside. Which reminds me: Dad called me into the kitchen the other night to ask me when I was getting out of school, going to Harvard, going back to school, etc. And I'm like, no, you guys can go on vacation without me. And then Dad says, "Would you like to go to Hong Kong?" Hah. Now I'm torn. I wish I could have it both ways, but I'm still going to take Harvard, I suppose. Must order plane tickets: I can't let you down, Charlie.  With luck, I won't succumb to sleep before piano lesson.
