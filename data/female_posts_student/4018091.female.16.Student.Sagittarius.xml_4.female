I felt bad :-\ but they stopped by afterwards to cheer me up and brought me two RED BULLS if you know me, then you know I get very happy over them! haha. Then I didn't do anything the rest of the day. Cody was very nice to me and called to check in on me. It was really sweet of him! Anyways! Today, I decided to go to the lake with my mom and brother. I wakeboarded. HOW COOL AM I!? Haha, and I pulled my little brother in the tube, it was alot of fun. Then on the way home we got Subway for dinner. YAY! Okay, I'm gonna go, byeee!!
