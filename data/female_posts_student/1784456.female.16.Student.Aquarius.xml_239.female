Oh yeah...slower typing, my brothers ill. But he wouldn't let me in so loud typing to get back at him! Muhaha! Mmm. Any way I'm trying to open up this window but it's not letting me! Meanie! I'm proud to admit that I'm a member of POSRAA (Pickled Onion Space Raders Addicts Anonymous) Cool huh? Apart from I'm not Katie...I'm an anonymous person. *cough* (Think I fooled them?) Izzy's setting up a queer site cause we all turned into biscuits...yup. Don't worry I'll put a link, or that is WORRY! Hehe. It'll probably take weeks to finish though cause I never finish sites I start! I was browsing and I found a really cool one!  urlLink http://garnet.nu/garnet/  Trust me it's cool! But that's only really if you've played FFIX. Mmm, I should go walk around the web. I'll shout if I see any thing interesting or step in a puddle. (EH?) Bubi.
