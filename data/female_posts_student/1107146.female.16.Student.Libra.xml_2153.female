I'm actually slacking at work to type this. And yes, this should be in my BLog, but considering the massive amount of not-posting that's going on here, I thought I would heavien (as in lighten, except the opposite) the load a bit. I'll talk to them.  I haven't bit anyone in a long time. However, a couple of days ago, there were two blueberry muffins left, and Mrs. Mallard took one, and was about to reach for the second...I felt strongly to bite her hand in that moment. God bless that lady. And Abby, I would never take the head off of your favorite Barbie,  ever , and that's an "I'll bleed on it" promise.  Everyone ask me about the Cousin It self-titled album coming out in a few days so I can drop clues and be reclusive about what I'm doing! Rock on, EMO children! Peace.
