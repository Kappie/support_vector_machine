I laid half of the brick in my garden.  Fun stuff.  But it was so hot and I didn't drink enough water so I started to get really dizzy, my legs started shaking, and my vision started blacking out so I had to go back inside. I am like the worst during heat. Haha. I hate it!!  La de do.  I am starting to get used to my braces, which is nice. Every hour I resemble a beaver  less  and more like Laura.
