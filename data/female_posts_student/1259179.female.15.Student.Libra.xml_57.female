Now I find myself, a couple of days away of being that old....  My youngest Melanie asked me a few days ago, how to spell 60... I asked her why and she said, Mom it's  for your birthday.... Now That Is Depressing...  I do feel like a 60 years old today.  Our Christmas was amazing.  Mom slept over.  Always a treat for us.  We went to our Church for a candlelight service on the 24th and on Christmas Morning, the girls where up at 6:15am but knew that 7:30am was the time to have Mom  Dad up....  We all got spoiled by Santa. My brother Mike and his wife Marthe and their kids Anthony and Rachel came by in the afternoon for dinner.    We had a ball.  It was so nice to relax, enjoy ourselves and just be merry.  A bit too much of drinking but still, lots of fun.  So now we are just taking it easy for a few days and playing with all of our Christmas Toys.  On this Beautiful Sunny Saturday Morning, have a great day and............Be Good
