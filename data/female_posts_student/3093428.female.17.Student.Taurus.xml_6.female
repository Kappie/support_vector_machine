So yeah, I passed Math and French, which is a huge victory. I went to go tell my conselor about droping a course next year to take eart science (the easiest science) when I came across a problem. Turns out eart science is full,so I gotta take BIO now!!! Noooooooo!!!! Just as I thought everthing was going as planned, it some how jumps the tracks. Well, i guess its not that bad. But wasn't planning on taking Bio.   So how on earth did the Liberals win again? That's insane! Notice how the conservatives won almost all the western provinces yet they still lost? Shows how much the east dominates the west.
