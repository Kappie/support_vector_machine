I didn't want to be all talk, so I looked it up and found that these days, tazers are all disguised as cell phones. The  urlLink Cell Phone Stun Gun  combines a 130 dB alarm with 180,000 volts of pure shocking power in a package that looks like an only slightly out-of-date cell phone. It even comes with a leather case, but unfortunately, doesn't come with an actual phone. It will set you back $80 and I'm trying to figure out how much damage it causes. The information is a little vague, but the website assures that there should be  no permanent damage .   They can be purchased at  urlLink Safety Technology . If anyone does any safety testing (not on pets or small children please, unpleasant adults only), please report your results!
