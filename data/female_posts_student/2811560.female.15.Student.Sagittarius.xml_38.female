I seriously spent hours writing that accompaniment part and I got no gratification at all. None whatsoever. That pisses me off. You know what else pisses me off? The fact that I have to miss our first Anything Goes rehearsal for the stupid play tomorrow. Ugh, I would much rather be at Anything Goes, but whatever. So I was reading through the script a while ago...oh man. I have lots of lines to memorize. Plus, I have to learn my wind ensemble audition music, which is really hard. WE auditions are like April 16, and the play is April 30. I am going to have a lot of work to do in the next month. Oh yeah and I made the font bigger. Just for you Jasmine, :).
