I would give my life… to see you smile  So sorry my darling… For the pain I inflicted In your sweet heart In your innocent soul  Not worthy your loving feelings for me I feel like a monster… I should hide in my cave and never emerge again  Can’t live by your side Can’t hurt you anymore  This way I’m leaving… For the best, I should go Away from you  I’ll never forget you I’ll never forget us  You gave me all the best I have Good memories I’ll take to my grave Your bright smile Your warm kiss Your sweet taste Your dazed perfume Your love for eternity, will glow my miserable dark soul
