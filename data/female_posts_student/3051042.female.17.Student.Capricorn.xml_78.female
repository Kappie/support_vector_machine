Went back to Ms. Otwell's class. Finished my English MEAP test. Got out of school. Went to work. Worked overtime (hell yeah...). Went to Espresso Royale in Ann Arbor. Saw Mr. Fuck-You-Whenever-I-Please. Talked. Got my peach iced tea. Left. Was forced to go to dinner with my dad. Blah. Went home.   I have to finish my research paper for Otwell tomorrow. It's due Wednesday... or one of those days that end in Y. Q, Tiki, and I have plans to hang out tomorrow. I'm sorry for blowing you off today, Tiki. I love you. I hate you Dad.
