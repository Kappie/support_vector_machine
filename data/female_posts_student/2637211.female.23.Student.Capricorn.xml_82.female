I'm already too unmotivated and I don't have any job skills and I'm probably just going to be a lazy bum housewife and that sucks. I don't want to be that, I want a grown-up job in the real world, but I just don't know anyone and can't do anything, and I can't see why anyone would hire me. I'm too shy and lame about getting a job, and I am frozen with indecision. I hate looking at my future.
