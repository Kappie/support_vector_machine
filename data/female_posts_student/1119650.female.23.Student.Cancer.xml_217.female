I ended up finally going to the Emergency Room at 2:30 in the morning only to be stuck with an IV, give blood, drink a ton of gross "medicines" and for the doctor to finally discharge me at 5:30 becuase "he didn't kwno what was wrong".  Supposedly it was some mini g.i. bug, but lemme tell you I hate many peeps but I wish this on NO ONE.  Goodness, it was like the most miserable night of my life.  Further more, Joe is a tool.  I think I'm going to have to break up with him.  No matter how much of a scumbag I say he isn't, he defintiley is.  That creeps me out.  Also, the more I drink around peopel the more I see waht they're really like as my internal walls come down I think my "crush blinders" also come down and I see shit for what it really is.  Joe is really nothing.  Ew.  He's complacent in a life thats on a fast track to the shitter.  Now comes the akward part of having to break up with him.  Last time he was fucking insane when this happened.  Hopefully he'll be cool this time.   Also, don't go to a beach front community when its raining, otherwise they will stick you in the most disgusting mildew smelling room that is freezing cold becuase it has no heat because its "only for summer use" okay, genius, why did you stick me in there, then? I swear to god, sometimes i hate my life, lol.  Other than that, the weekend was fun, I hung out with colleen alot, which was cool, I got to spend sometime with my lil lisa!, and the claw machines on the boardwalk had afrokens!  Woooooo!
