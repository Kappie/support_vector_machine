One day, they found a genie in a lamp who said he would grant them each three wishes.The bear went first and he said,"I wish to be the only male bear in this forrest." And he got his wish.  The rabbit said, "I want a motercycle helmet." And he got his wish.  The bear went up and said, "I wish to be the only male bear in the United States, and all the rest to be female." And he got his wish.  The rabbit said, "I wish I had a motorcycle to go with that helmet." And he got his wish.  The bear said, "I wish I was the only male bear in the world, and all the rest were females." And he got his wish.  It was the rabbit's turn, and he said, "I wish that bear was gay."
