I spent the weekend at a friend's house, watching hours upon hours of Deep Space 9 (for all those who don't know, it was a Star Trek saga that started in '93) and eating marshmallow/chocolate s'mores Pop-Tarts. Wow. It was soooooo much fun! It was so fantastic to see as many episodes as I could. I'm really starting to love Star Trek. But I'm not obsessed...yet. Those things sneak up on me like a bad sneeze. Only less sticky. ^IMAGE^ *shudders* Ewwwwwww...maybe not. Ciao!
