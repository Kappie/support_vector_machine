(Like size 8 for all you normal font sizes people) Apparantly it's cause my brother changed the resolution from 5/12 to 10/24 ....whatever that means! So this is really small! Aaargh! (Yeah, think I've gone over that already) But wow... this is so small!  urlLink http://www.darwinawards.com/  I've read the book! Some of the stuff was seriously dumb! Ahh, I've got Chemistry homework to do :(. I mean what the hell is simple and fractioned distillation? Our teacher didn't tell us and we're supposed to do this homework? And what the hell does it mean by 'in a table?' EH????
