The week appears as if it will rain every single day. (blah)   urlLink Cheese  rocks.  Great model for anyone who needs to make a change in their life, whether they embrace it or fight against it the whole way.  Going to go for a shopping walk this morning.  Heard that B2 (riboflavin) taken in 400mg doses every day for a month reduced folks' migraines from four a month to two.  Worth a shot.  Retreat this afternoon; concert tonight.  Wish I had been able to sleep more than 4 hours.  At least tomorrow should be peaceful.  TTC subway is 50 years old on Tuesday.  The  urlLink Toronto Star  did an article describing the changing art and styles of the subway stations.  A big congratulations goes to the Dundas Station on the Yonge line whose walls are tiled "in bile-green so hideous it's enough to induce nausea". (Christopher Hume, 27 Mar 2004, GTA Section.)  Got to go. The library, grocery store and Shoppers Drug Mart are calling.  More to come...
