Anywayz, I went to enchanted kingdon yesterday with Nina, Julienne, Jona, and Franz along with our moms and dads and it was really fun. (LOL-hit me if that was a run-on sentence). Saturday we went to Divisoria-it was allright, stinky but fun. And that day I heard my favorite song-by Lisa Loeb (Stay-I Missed You)3 times!!! LOL. I'm waiting right now in this really cool bookstore just enjoying life.
