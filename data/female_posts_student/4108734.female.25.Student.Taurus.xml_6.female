However, my party-going experience always seems to get tainted.  Let me explain.  I generally spend about half of my time catching up with people I haven't seen in months, experiencing random deep conversations.  The other half I generally spend people-watching.  (Parties are one of the best places to do this, if you're a people watcher and didn't already know that.)  Unfortunately, part of people watching is frequently being baffled by the actions of the subject of your attention.  Or in some cases, you even begin to be annoyed by their behavior.  I have noticed that at nearly every party I attend (meaning people my age with lots of single folk there) there is at least one girl who makes her need for attention quite obvious.  She also generally makes it obvious from which male she would like attention.  Well, tonight, in the midst of trying to have those random deep conversations with people I haven't seen in months, I found myself getting incredibly irritated by one particular girl at the party.  She was loud and distracting, and making obvious plays for attention from a boy that didn't want to pay attention to her.  I found myself wanting to leave, just to get away from this one girl.    Then I started to think...sometimes I'm that girl to other people.  I may not be loud and annoying at parties, but I'm sure there is some deeply rooted issue that I have that drives other people nuts when they're around me.  I wish that people would say something to me in those times.  Like..."Lynette, your issues are bothering me...is there something you'd like to talk about?  What's your deal, freakazoid?"  Ok, maybe not like that...but I wish people wouldn't be so afraid to speak what they're thinking.  To speak what's real.  Yes, you should consider people's feelings, and be gracious to them.  But if I have some annoying characteristic, I'd rather have it pointed out to me than to have it persist for the entirety of my lifespan, you know?  I'd want people to be real about it.  Even if it hurts.  Because sometimes I just can't see past my nose, and I don't see the way that my selfish actions are affecting others.  Heck, I may even be hurting them, not just annoying them.    I think I may just be babbling because it's nearly 3 in the morning and I haven't slept much lately.  Sometimes 3 in the morning is the best time to process thoughts, though.  Spoooooooooooooooooooon!!!!!!!
