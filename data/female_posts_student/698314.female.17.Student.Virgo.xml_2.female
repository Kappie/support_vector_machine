Just went to school and then practice.  Well actually, I trained for the lax game and some of baseball- just bounced back and forth, because... well... that's a long story I won't get into.  Whatever, it was fun.  I always have fun there, for the most part.  Sometimes I get frustrated or pissed, but for the most part I always enjoy myself.  I usually find something to laugh about... chances are I'll just do something stupid and that'll start it off.  Then last night I went home and did homework.  Then I went to bed.  That's usually my life.... shcool training homework sleep.  Today was a good day too though.  Went to school... blah! I really don't like school that much anymore.  Aside from the occational few good moments, I don't really like it.  Strange since I live there- but I really like it after classes (does that make any sense).  Anyway, then did the whole training thing.  There was a track meet today and since softball had a night game I hung out with Miss C. for a while there.  Today was one of those days where I was frustrated and pissed but something happened, I can't even remember what, and it made it all better.  Weird how that can happen.  After that it was a pretty good night.  Went and got Wendy's for dinner. YUM. Ate it at the field watching our softball game.  Good times in the training room afterwards when we were cleaning up.  :-) hahahaha Now.... I'm home... avoiding studying for my english test.  THat's about it... Maybe i'll study a lil and go to bed early! GASP! haha ok... Im done babbling now.  maybe I'll update tomorrow.
