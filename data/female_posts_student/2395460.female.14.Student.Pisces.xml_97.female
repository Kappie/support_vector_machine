Available from   urlLink  Brookstone   , the Föm pillow line is the latest answer to stress relief and sleeping comfort. The original Föm was a watermelon-sized stress reliever. After a warm reception to it’s first style, the line was expanded to include models geared towards sleeping comfort and travel.    Although Brookstone’s pillows have a catchy name and are available in seemingly every mall in America, the concept is not an original one. The original polystyrene powder bead (the substance inside) was introduced to the U.S. from Japan and was called the MOGU.     urlLink  MOGUs    are available onlineand come in a variety of shapes and colors much more extensive than the Föm line.    In either case, once you try one you are sure to be hooked. I can’t resist stopping by Brookstone anytime I’m in the mall. In fact… I’m having dinner with the assistant manager on Thursday night ;)
