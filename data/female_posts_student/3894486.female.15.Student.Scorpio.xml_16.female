Come to find out they all thought I was a frosh lol well once the band director announced that I was a new student I got bombarded with people introducing themselves. It was hysterical. Well I met this chick Becky. She's prty cool and I went to her house after BC(band camp). We walked to the mall and talked alot.    Today was my 2nd day of BC and it was beckys b-day(happy birfday hun!). Well I was supposed to go to her house after BC but my sis was supposed to be in town but then come to find out after I got home my sis isn't coming till tomorrow and my ma wouldnt drive me back out to beckys house. so maria came over and we chilled then went to the mexican-american festival. We chilled w/simeon a little . Then this kid was smoking and I almost had an asthma attack! I like could of died. Thats sick. I hate when people smoke! Speically someone who's only 17! urgh! sick! ( stand  up speak out against tobacco! haha I'm a member of  stand ! I wish I would have had  stand  gear on at the time! lol that would have been funny!) but yeah then we left and came back here. Danielle came over and the three of us watched my new dvd 'You got served' . I am so obsessed with that movie! Maria's sleeping over tonite so thats good. she's upstairs rite now doing who knows what. but yeah...guess what everyone! I'm starting hip-hop dance(pop n' lock,breakdancing, and general street dancing) on the 23rd! I can't wait! I love being on dance crew at church but I'm not so great so I decided I wanted to take classes because I just LOVE to dance. This is the one type of dance I think I could actually learn how to do well. lol but yeah so thats exciting.    Lately I've been having alot of trouble being outgoing. because like I don't even fit in at church and thats sad. I just feel so left out of everything. I have two best friends(you know who you are) and thats all. I did have more but they all are leaving me for other people. I don't even know what I did. there was one person who well lets just say we were beyond tight (lol ghetto me! haha yeah right!) but then some things happened and well now we're talking again which is sweet. I really hope we get close again. Then there's another person who I really really thought cared about me and I duuno we were like pretty close ya know hung out alot and just had fun. Well I have no idea why but this person like doesn't ever seem to wanna hang out anymore and that hurts alot. I call this person like all the time but they're always with someone. They say they're just busy and we'll hang out soon but if this person really wanted to hang out with me they could actually ya know now hang with the other friends for once...mabye I'm being to sensitive but seriously I just feel like I have some disease thats keeping people from me. With all the people leaving me I'm starting to be not outgoing anymore because like I'm so afraid of not fitting ing and just being rejected. I'm so scared about my new school! *shivers* Only God can save me now! but no matter what if everyone leaves me I still have my best friend Jesus Christ to be there for me. because no matter what he'll never leave me! I love JC!
