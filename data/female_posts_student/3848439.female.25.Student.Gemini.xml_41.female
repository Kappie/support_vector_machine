So of course, to compensate, I find myself trying to force myself to do things that I find distasteful or scary.  At CPE, I've discovered that often ends up being the best thing.  Often, the room I least want to go into (I'll disturb them, They're talking, They look like they're trying to sleep, That patient just looks really cranky) ends up being a place God calls me to.  Dangit!  All this denial of self and taking up my cross daily is giving me splinters on my back!
