I'm rather disapointed at the response of reviews for H:TNG, so that isn't going to be updated until my other stories have, probably Tuesday or Wednesday. It's going to have to take a back-seat, though the two reviewers for chapter 16, still have my whole-hearted 'Thanx'. The response i got for  17Whatever  was incredable. That will definately get an update on Monday, but right now Sebastian is out-of-town and therefor we cannot update. My newest story, Hiding In Plain Sight will also be updated either Monday or Tuesday, so have no fear about that! I got three positive reviews for it and that made me extactic!  Now for the reviews,  Hiding In Plain Sight, Prologue   biblios  - Thanks for the review, Mcgonagol in Oven-mitts, that image is enough to make ME shiver. Hehe. Who says Snape even has feelings for Harry **whistles inocently**. Hope you keep reading, i enjoy reading funny reviews!  Miki23  - I completely understand. I love seeing that to. The best part of any Sev/Har is the part where Harry is trying to convince Snape. It's my first time in this pairing, so i'm going to try and make it completely original, but since there is only so much i can do, i'm not promising!  Crys Skywalker  - I'm glad you like it. Don't you just heart mean Snape? I know i do. Therefor he's going to be typically Snape in the fic. I can garuntee minimal fluffiness!!   17Whatever, Chapter 5   The Shadower  - as always, i'm thrilled about your response. You're possibly one of the best reviewers a writter could have. I like the fact that you tell me what you like and voice your ideas. I'd tell you if you were right.....but that would be far to easy **evil grin*  amy  - don't worry. You won't have to wait long.   H:TNG, Chapter 15    Yaoi-is-gay-13  - Thanks a lot. I still adore 'spiffiness' mind if Skyler uses it? I know about the whole Harry/Ron/Mione thing, it's really hard to write, i keep wanting to make Harry go running to Hermione every five minutes!!! Don't worry though, who knows, maybe it'll take a turn for the better....then again....maybe not ;-)  Sowen  - I'm glad i'm writing it too. Glad you're getting back into the story also!Updated Wednesday at the very latest. Thanks for the review.  And that as they say is that. Chances are i won't post again until the weekend's over, i have much to do!  Enjoy your weekend people.
