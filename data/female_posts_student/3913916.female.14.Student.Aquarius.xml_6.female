"...Farewell to you my friend, we'll see each other again. Don't cry coz its not the end of everything...I may be miles away, but here in your heart I'll stay, with you, my friend..."    Some people come and go. Some leave then someone else takes there place in your life. Some leave without anyone noticing.  Of course, special people in our lives won't be disregarded. We would miss them, feel so lonely without them and of course, always txt/call/email them most of the time.  Hindi natin maiiwasan yung pag-alis ng mga espesyal na tao sa buhay natin. Mahirap mapigilan ang pag-alis ng isang tao.  But in every loss there's always a replacement. And someday, somehow, this lost person would be found again.  The "replacement" of the special person may not be as special as the lost one. But at least we have someone NEW to share our lives with.  It may hurt to lose a friend/a loved one. But it takes time for us to heal that "hurt" we feel inside.  They may keep in touch with us so far but time after time they would stop communicating with us.  Someday this lost person would just pop out of nowhere and say 'Hi' and whatsoever. Then we might not know this person that well. We might not also know [by face]who they are the next time we see them.           ** I made this entry for the day because 1 of our classmate last year -  jeanne  cruz sent vicky an letter/card for the class. It felt sad for me coz even though we weren't that close friends there are some memories we shared together. Another reason is  Sir Romero 's moving to another department. He's been very nice to us.They are planning to move him to another department this school year. For a short period of time, Sir was really nice and gave interesting facts that made our discussions very fun to learn.  Bea,  also made a card for us. I know I'll really miss her even if we didn't spend time with each other.**        sorry medyo magulo 'to...wala ako sa sarili ko ngayon...atsaka may ginagawa ako...   oh klar, lari, yan wala na si mickey ah! [ay sa xanga nga pala yun! hahaha]
