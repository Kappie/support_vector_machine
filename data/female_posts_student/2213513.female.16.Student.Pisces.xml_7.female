Anyway, Timeline, is sooooooo good, Paul Walker isn't even in it that much and I still liked it. The main girl, that Paul likes, her name is Kate...it was soo weird hearing him like saying my name like that. The girl was dumb though. Tomarrow there is a wrestling tourny, our first one. OH, and for my journalism class were making newspapers in groups. One of the articles I'm writing for it is an interview with a wrestler. LOL, it's a feature story. I just don't know which wrestler to do yet. I also have to write a news story about our winterball. I'm also the editor of our groups paper. I'm kind of upset though, because the photographer is a frosh, so all the pictures are going to be of freshmen...oh well. As long as we get a good grade! I think it's going to be a really fun project though. Yeah, I have a D in photography. It's because my camera was broken, so I couldn't take pictures! As soon as I turn in my film though I'll have an A, which should be really soon, like end of next week. I think if I met Paul Walker, I would sit there staring at him, not knowing what to do. Hmmm I'm tired so this entry is going to be short! Night! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
