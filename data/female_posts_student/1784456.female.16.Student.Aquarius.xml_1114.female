Yeah, it's a me thing. Plus I'm tired any way... which you shouldn't question. (Cryptic and weird.) Not dogey. Ahh, got that sorted out! Aww, Cleo's here! All the cats come up for a hug when I'm on the computer. Which is fine... but really hard to type one handed! Mmm better, aww what a nice story. Sorry, I read one again on some where or other site place (I'm not gonna tell you so :P) Hehe, cruel huh? Not really just don't like every one to know what I do *all* the time. Just half of it. Keeps some secrecy (like I've got any) Muhaha, but I have! Every one has secrets, otherwise they wouldn't be secrets. (Yes, pointless but correct.) Thank you, that's sooo kind. (Ahh go back to reading, book worm girl) Wow, cool name (Not really) Yes... I'm running away now like you. Bubi!
