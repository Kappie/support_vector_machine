I then called my grandparents and my grandma answered. I talked to her a little bit, prob. the only time i was really happy to hear her voice. I mean, ive been happy before, but this is the most happiest ive been to hear it. Here's the only grandmother i've like known all my life, even when i lived states away. This is the family that's always been there for me. And now, im stuck a state away with my loving father, but with his family who hasnt given a damn about me. I told my grandma i was going to go see my "aunt" Holt soon and she reminded me of what she said, just give her a chance. Sure, i'll give her a chance, the chance she never ever gave me. After i hung up i started to cry, in fact, i have tears running down my face down. Im trying to hold them back because we're going again here soon to see her and my "cousin" Kay, and i dont want to ruin my makeup. This is my time to show how much i've grown and how much she and the rest of the family has missed out on.   My dad took me to this little old village that is suppose to preserve the town as it used to be. Everything there has something to do with the Lynch's. I swear, half the town was my grandfathers or his dads. and my dad shows me all of this stuff that was his families...and i honestly feel like i should actually care and be like "whoa..thats so AWESOME" but i dont...  When i went to get my hair done we went to this place that is inside the families home. my first thought was kitchen chair or basement stool (haha) haircuts, but nope, they turned their lil basement area, almost like its own buliding into this really cool hair place. The man and his wife are like family, they are such good friends, and they are sooo funny! the guy got out his guitar and played me "feliz navidad" haha i wanted to roll on the floor. He then sang me a Barney song haha. He has 2 daughters, one who cut my hair, shes grown witha family, shes really loud..i mean, her voice is LOUD. and he has another who just grad. high school. She'll turn 18 on sunday. They're gonna have a cookout and invite us over, he said there were a lot of cute guys..haha Hes a trip. I'm going to go back later before i come home and get mulitcolor highlites/lowlites. I'm getting my bleach blonde redone but adding some browns, like carmel, and some darker reds...haha yay! it's almost like a britney spears meets christina a. yeah...but minus christinas sluty-ness. lol and of course britney's body..haha i wish i looked like that!  Right now im talkin to Todd Simmons and telling him about how that freshman kid got "turned on" by me in this tutu i had to wear for a play and my hair in pigtails and me with a belt..and a leash tied around my neck..dont ask why i had a belt and a leash, it just seemed funny at the time. haha He's loving it. He said when i get home we're gonna have to hang out. gosh...i like todd...hes so hot...hahaha
