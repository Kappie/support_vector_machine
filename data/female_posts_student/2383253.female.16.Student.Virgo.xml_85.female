       
      For the past 3 weeks, I've been completely alone and by myself. I haven't seen a damn soul, save for my parents and brothers. It's literally so unbearable. I miss all of my friends and school so bad, I can't describe it. I hardly get out anymore--just to do the community service and maybe drop my brother off somewhere. Here's a picture of my social life:     Behold, the great abyss of my social life. Boohoo. Someone help me create/improve/develop one? PLEASE?!
