I kept setting up the tank and then it'd leak and I'd fix it and then fill it up agian and it'd leak... but it is fixed now so that is good.  I had a lot of homework for the first weekend of school but that's alright, I guess. I wrote a really lame mini-essay on Ari Ben Canaan from  Exodus   I got new shoes. They are Converse One-stars and they're black and white. They rock.  School tomorrow!  Party on!  -Candice
