Hungry (Falling On My Knees)   Hungry, I come to you for I know you satisfy I am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry   And so I wait for You so I wait for You                         I'm falling on my knees              Offering all of me         Jesus, You're all this heart is living for    Broken, I run to You for Your arms are open wide I am weary, but I know Your touch restores my life And so I wait for You so I wait for You      A Pure Heart   A pure heart, that’s what I long for. A heart that follows hard after Thee; A pure heart, that’s what I long for. A heart that follows hard after Thee.    VERSE: A heart that hides Your Word So that sin will not come in. A heart that’s undivided But one You rule and reign; A heart that beats compassion, That pleases You, my Lord. A sweet aroma of worship That rises to Your throne.    Be The Centre   VERSE 1: Jesus, be the centre Be my source, be my light Jesus  Jesus, be the centre Be my hope, be my song Jesus  CHORUS: Be the fire in my heart Be the wind in these sails Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus  VERSE 2: Jesus, be my vision Be my path, be my guide Jesus     Be the Centre (ver. 2)  VERSE 1: Jesus, be the centre Be my source, be my light Jesus  Jesus, be the centre Be my hope, be my song Jesus  CHORUS: Be the fire in my heart Be the wind in these sails Be the reason that I live Jesus, Jesus  VERSE 2: Jesus, be my vision Be my path, be my guide Jesus   Change My Heart, Oh God   Change my heart oh God, make it ever true. Change my heart oh God, may I be like You.          You are the potter,         I am the clay,         Mold me and make me,         This is what I pray.      I feel like JOB... like all this pain has a greater purpose.. but for now i hurt... and it seems endless...    Job's Song  Been broken, put through the fire, Felt the heat melt all my strength away. Felt so lonely, felt so abandoned "Where is God?" I heard my little voice say.           I need You, I need You,              Oh Lord please hold me next to You.           I need You, I need You,         Oh Lord, don't let me fall from You.  Lord I know this world isn't easy, And I know that You never promised no pain. Trials will come and trials will test me, But help me Lord, it's hard to see them as gain.  I forgot that You're right here beside me, Let me know that You're with me through the length. Though I'm weak, Lord, this is my prayer, Through my weakness, Lord please be my strength.
