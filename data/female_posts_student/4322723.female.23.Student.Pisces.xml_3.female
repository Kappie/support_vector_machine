So who am I? Where did I come from? Why do I rant? Why do I rave? All will be revealed over time in this little spot of mine.  Today my son Lachlan is at pre school having his first ever school pictures taken. He has a new haircut and spiffy little outfit on and as he informed me this morning, he actually looks like Spiderman. I was under the impression that Spiderman wore a red and black body suit but, heh, what do I know! Apparently Lachlan has been watching the  other  version of the movie where Toby Mcquire decides that he looks a little gay in his hero outfit and chooses to instead go to the little fella's section in Kmart and buy a check shirt and jeans. Or maybe, this is what Spiderman wears to school photo day! Lachlan, my little hero.  Speaking of men in tights, My brother in law has become a festering, jelly like, lump on my couch. He came over for a visit about 2000 years ago and just hasnt left. He sits and sits and SITS - occasionally moving to pee or eat. I am starting to fear coming home from work and finding him fossilised, like petrified wood, in an eternal position of unemployed slackness on our couch.  Wayne, please leave.
