I wore my new shirt ($7 brand new at the Gap *STEAL!*) and my new shirt and my black pants and I felt so ..elegant and pretty. Math was good, we got to play games. Info tech was good, I got to play games and goof off. I spent lunch with Laura in the library working. Psych was good, I goofed and walked around the school and chillaxed. Socials I tortured the teacher and was totally off teh wall hyper. I think I made him think I belong in an institute for teh mentally unstable (and I do! :P). It was sunny and warm outside, and I was so overjoyed, I skipped home. I did lots of my homework, got lots done, and went online. Tyler, the best guy ever is taking me out for ice cream on Saturday, for no real reason, just to be sweet and random ( and I think he's gonig to ask me out....squee!) and I'm overjoyed and hyper.  I also formed LOL today. League Of Losers. :) Mwahhahahahahahahahhahahahaha  My rant? There are growing numbers of people who have my blue hair. Trend whores. Even if mine's more green. Pleh!  I'm gonig to go SPIN now! YAY!!!
