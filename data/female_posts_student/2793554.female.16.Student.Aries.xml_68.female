I'm going to be in shape and be all sexy, i swear...  but that creepy creepy man is STILL at the rec center, oogling little girls... he's so fat and so old and so creepy. You walk in and he rapes you with his eyes.  me and melissa broke her car today. She ran into a curb and then we were driving down arapahoe and there was this huge popping sound and i was like "oh god, her tire popped, were gonna need to call a cab or a tow truck or walk/bus home... shitty... " and then we got out and it turns out the lining in her tire well just FELL OUT and her bumper was all loose...but it was so hilarious to see this huge part of her car dragging alongside the car for a bit. but we took it off and put it in her trunk ( the huge piece of plastic) and went home and got another car. And she might sell me her old car! (not the one that broke.) w00t.  god, im moody. i still hate everything and everyone today...but i do feel a lot better. i keep expecting all these things out of all these people and maybe my expectations are too high...or maybe people just suck. I feel sort of like i'm in a balloon, floating away from the rest of the world. Or in a bubble.  and no matter what i do, i keep floating away and i cant do anything about it. i guess i have all these things pent up that have been going on for a while, but theres not really anybody who would get it and i would just feel stupid trying to talk. And its hard to explain. Ill just do what i always do and ignore it until it gets bigger and i cry and then it goes away.  because that is easy.  i'm sorry i'm so dramatic, everyone...  mm, pizza downstairs. i'm out!
