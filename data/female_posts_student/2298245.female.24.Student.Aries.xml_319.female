This one was like those scenes in the movies where you accidentally overhear a conversation that just changes everything for you, or puts all the pegs into place for you, and is rather unwelcome or uninviting information that you have been wanting to know for months, but only if it came out the other way, and now that it hasn't, you wish you could forget it and go back to living in blissful ignorance.  And then, just when you think the situation cannot get any worse, someone else blunders into the picture, someone connected to the situation, but who doesn't realize that you, too, are connected, and of all the people present, you are the only person who truly understands the whole of the situation and how horribly disappointing it is for you, but since no one else present could possibly understand that (you could explain it, but it would only make you sound pathetic or insane), you must carry on a mundane conversation as if nothing is out of the ordinary.  And even that conversation manages to be about how much your life sucks, anyway, but for a completely different reason.  Not that I expected the whole affair to turn out any differently.  I just didn't expect it to happen in so trite and formulaic a way.  My life is sometimes like a movie, but it's usually more like one directed by David Lynch:  kind of weird and makes no sense.  But at least this whole thing is finally over.  And hopefully, I can put it easily behind me, not dwell too much on it, and move on.  I realize that reading this, many of you will not have a clue what I am talking about.  And that's fine.  That's as it should be.  Being too specific will only lead to trouble.  It's something that I have to deal with on my own.  But it's nice to have had this space to work out my thoughts.  And since I've written them, I'm of course going to post them, as a public reminder to myself of all the time I've wasted on silly fantasies.  I've been brought back down to Earth today, and been given a healthy dose of reality, and now it is time to move on, and let the real work commence.  Onward and upward, as they say.
