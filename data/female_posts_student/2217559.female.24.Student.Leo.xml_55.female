So, I was thinking last night after a long conversation with Jennifer, that it would be awesome to get everyone together for a weekend in Gruene for toobing down the river. I need to find that website with all of the information but ifwe book in advance we can get good rates and availability. There are little cabanas thatyou can rent for like $25.00 a night (so cheap) right on the guadalupe river. You can have camp fires and showers and anything really that you want. I will get my mother to forward me the link so i can post it here if anyone's interested. I was thinking maybe one weekend late June, early July. (Of course we still have plenty of time to discuss).  Things are going well here. Moral is a little low because we are all sooooo sick of the Mexican Riviera. I have no desire to have Mexican Food again in my life or for that matter drink a corona or pina colada. We changed course in about one month - March 12th - we have what's called a "dead head" cruise. This means we have no passengers on boad for 24 hours. We will be sailing from San Diego to San Francisco.  It should be a lot of fun - of course - only if we get a ew staff captain. The one we have right now is a mini Hitler. He gives warning for anything and you can imagine how hard it is for this Texas girl. I swear Texans are just our own breed of people. So friendly, low key - everyone else seems to just spaz about the smallest things.  Take for example - our security onboard - They are all from Israel. Apparently, they have to go through extensive training in the Israeli army to even be considered for a position onboard a ship. They have to be in the top of their class. So, just knowing that bit of information you can imagine how strict they are about the rules onboard. Then throw on top of that the evil dictator onboard and it's just ughhh.    Meanwhile, I have approximately 100 days left onboard the Mercury. And I am counting.   Today is a busy day. all the guests are complaining about their bills, organizing their luggage and just andering around the ship running into walls. Quite funny though - it's amazing to see how stable the employee have become when we have rough weather. By the way, when I refer to "rough weather" i am not speaking in terms of rain, snow, hurricanes - I am spekaing of the swells in the ocean.  The sea can become very rough at times and when it does our ship stabilizers are actually working extra hard ot keep the motion at a minimum. Today it has been pretty rough in that doors swing back and forth, things on our desks slide around and even funnier - our guests actually run into walls and each other. The crew has learned how to workin these conditions because we are here all the time. But the guests, oh it's funny - people walk in zig zags. Hehehehe.   I have talked to people who have been working on ships for 30 years and heard stories of ships almost turning over, 90 foot waves crashing down on the 14th deck - pretty scary stuff. it's hard to imagine when they are telling me these stories because it's just something I have never seen. The scary thing i I ill be in mid-Hurricane season on my next contract - and in a very dangerous area of Florida. Whew. I need to think about this a little more.  Anyway, I am blabbing but I hope everyone is doing well. I hear the weather there has been very cold and evensome snow recently!?!?!? What's this crap baout? It never snows and when I leave we finally get some>>>>  Go figure.  It's been hot as hell in Acapulco - oh crap - speaking of which I want to tell you about the tsunami that attacked me at Sunset beach.....  My friends - Dave (the art auctioneire), Karen (his girlfriend), and Jason (the entertainer) and myself all decided to actually do something positive and educational in Acapulco for a change since all we ever do is sit aorund somewhere and drink. We hired a driver for about 4 hours and went on a tour. We saw the cliff divers - and if you have neverseen something like this, I highly recommendyou visit Acapulco.  There were about 5 guys who climbed (bare footed, with no safety ropes or anything) up a 100 foot cliff and dived straight into the ocean. It was the most incredible thing I have seen. I can't imagine taking a jump like that. (Apparently they are paid pretty well and are treated famously in Acapulco).  Ou next destination was the hotel Flamingo that John Wayne built. It was very quaint and the view was incredible. I was surprised that the overnight rates were so low - you can rent the honeymoon suite for about $75.00 per night and the balcony opens up to the ocean, there is a jacuzzi and a hammock right outside the door. It was really nice. John Wayne's private cabana was nice as well with a private access walk to the beach view. The cabana was shape din a circle with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Very nice and all that can be yours for about $250 a night. (The most expensive on the property).   Now, to the tsunami part - we went to the lagoon and sunset beach in Acapulco shortly after. Had some lunch on the beach at this restaurant and then decided to go horseback riding on the beach. First of all 3 of 4 horses quite possibly could have been donkeys. But nontheless, we hopped on and wentup and down the beach.  It was great. Karen and I decided to take a swim in the ocean afterwards so we went trotting off to the sea. We jumped in and started swimming out a bit. 2 minutes after we are out there, I look over my shoulder and see a SIX - yes SIX - FOOT wave coming directly towards us. I looked at her and screamed, "SWIM!!!!!" And she dove under the wave and survived. Me, I couldn't get under quick enough so I was sucked up by the current and thrown against the bottom of the ocean floor. It was death moment for me. I realy thought I wasn't going to come up. There was so much water and I came up gasping for air. I was practically running on the water to get out before the next one struck. Very scary!! All in all no broken bones or anythin - just some major whiplash and a black eye. (My hand hit me in the face when I was thrushed down.) So, I don't think I am going to swim in  the ocean anymore. Hehehe. No more for me.  Damn, I guess I had a lot to talk about. Sorry for rambling. I miss everyone so much and can't wait to get home and irritate the hell out of all of you.   Lots of love, Shell
