    
       I'm at work, working on a project. It was supposed to be done by 3 this afternoon, but that didn't happen. My boss won't be mad though because it was kinda the client's fault that I haven't had much time to do it. . .  Anyway, it's not working, and I'm frustrated. And I don't know what to do because I've tried everything to make it work. Ugh.
