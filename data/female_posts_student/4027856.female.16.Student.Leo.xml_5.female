Guys, whoever is picking me up for the airport better have hersheys bars and Ben and jerrys waiting somewhere in the vicinity.  I can't sleep anymore. I have decided, that's all there is too it, I have become a semi-insomniac..It's actually quite a fun little thing. Wondering around the house, being the only one awake....Staying up till the birds start to sing again...And the sun rises...And then of course finally falling asleep.  But it is so strange. I have found that I can sleep so easily back in Ohio. But up here I think so much, it's like life up here isn't real. Like any second now I am going to step out into the street..And my life will be taken..And I will have wasted it in this dream...Yes that is how life is for me here..So sweet that you don't expect it to last.  I think that is why it is so hard getting adjusted back in Ohio...Because down there problems are real..And I have to stick out and face them on my own, up here I have my mom, my real mom, not someone separated by a step. I love my mommy..And yes I still call her moma. But I just can't wait I think..To go back and live my down there..And then next year be up here for real..To live.  I must be bipolar..I keep having these mixed feelings. Ok short and sweet I love it here I love it there, I love life so much right now thatit scares me..But in an exciting way, like I  have  to live tomorrow like its my last..Even though it may not be, life is just more fun that way....I love it..I can't wait for somuch...I really need some patience..And sleep
