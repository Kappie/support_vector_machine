It wouldn’t budge. I was stuck in the god-forsaken room, and there were no other exits.  “Where are you going?” The Prince put his hand on my shoulder and I quit my relentless wrenching on the door.  “I need to get out of here,” I said not facing him.  “Why?”  “Look at me, I’m not me. I don’t belong here. I just want to go home,” I turned around and sunk to the floor. I crossed my legs and leaned my head back. The Prince sat down next to me.  “Do you really want to leave?” He asked quietly.  “Yes,” I whispered.  “Okay,” he sighed, “follow me.” The Prince grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We wound our way through the people, and to a curtain behind a row of chairs. He looked behind us quickly, and then pulled me behind it.  In front of us, was a very small black door. I bent down and pushed it open. There was barely enough space for me to crawl through, but I did. When I stood up, I was knee deep in grass. Blue and purple flowers sprouted as high as trees above me.  It was dark out, but the clouds blocked the stars from view. All I could see was the moon above me. I jumped a bit as the Prince grabbed my hand.  “Where am I?” I asked.  “The Queen’s garden,” he said shyly.  “How did she get the flowers so big?”  “You mean how did she make us so small?”  “I’m not small!” I said defiantly, “I’m five-foot-six-and-a-half thank you.”  “Well you’re certainly not very big compared to the flowers,” he said matter-of-factly. I sniffed at him and walked away. I had come out to get away from the castle and the Prince, so now was the time to find my way home. Only, I didn’t get very far because about ten steps ahead of me, a big gray cat lay in my way. He was roughly one mile in each direction, and there was no way to get over him. Angrily I stalked past the flowers and headed towards the moon.
