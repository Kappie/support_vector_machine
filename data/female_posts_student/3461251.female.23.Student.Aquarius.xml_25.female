They didn't even do the whole easter bunny thing with him. Which I do believe was kinda wrong! :-(  So I guess Easter went "okay" other then the fact John is to selfish to show up for breakfast OR dinner. Why is it I'm the only one that sees the tears in my moms eyes when no one shows up for the holidays? But on the other hand I know why they don't! It's my dad's fault, instead of just enjoying the holidays - He always has to turn it in to some fucking yelling fight between someone and him. Then someone always goes home in tears, which is usually me because I'm stupid and I take everything to heart.  I just wish I had the nerve to just call John up and tell him what he did wrong but it wouldn't do me any good because I'm younger then him, which means I don't know shit in his eyes. Whatever. At least I showed up for the holidays despite the fact I couldn't eat anything.  I really really hate this no-eating-through-stress-bullshit. I want a chocolate bunny! :-(
