The rest of the class was spent reliving snipets from the day six years ago.  It was a Friday (last year was leap year, remember), and things were slow in Government class.  We must have had an exam or some like thing because I'd brought my current book with me to fill the remaining 40 minutes.  The author had included his wedding ceremony in the text and I was struck by how similar the sentiments and promises described in the passage resembled feelings, thoughts and conversations Lorraine and I had on a regular basis.    We'd done the play "Will you marry me?" thing quite a bit.  Mostly in the context of playful, relaxed, lazy evenings or afternoons basking in the few hours we had together that seemed to stretch on for days.  But reading these exchanges this day suddenly made me want to do it for real, if only in our own minds.  And so, I left class knowing I would ask the woman I loved to marry me that evening.    It was a pretty informal affair.  None of our friends were in attendance, and we never received any gifts.  I even, quite by accident, called her by her ex's name at one point, reading the name out of the text (what are the odds that the author's wife's name had same name as her ex?!)  But it was sweet and we celebrated it every year, in whatever capacity we could.    Without realizing it, we had a perfect celebration last night.  I returned home from a full day of brilliant law school activities around 9, and pushed on for another half an hour before finally admitting defeat.  Scraped a picnic dinner together in front of the TV, at last free to relax and enjoy the remnants of Thursday night TV.  When the phone rang, I whined and refused to get up unless it was someone letting me know I'd just won a free puppy or something.  Pretty close.  It was that girl, calling to say a quick goodnight before her Sleep-Be-Here kicked in.  It was pretty perfect, really, and the fact that neither of us knew what date it was probably contributed.  Had good laughs like we used to, and told idiosyncratic stories that illustrate more about who we are as people than long, involved, deep conversations; there's just nothing like coming home completely ragged to an unexpected connection with someone who knows you completely.    Happy Anniversary, my Mrs. Jesus.
