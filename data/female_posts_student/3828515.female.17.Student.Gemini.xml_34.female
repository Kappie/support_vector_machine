The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, make them."  - George Bernard Shaw  I'm actually going to elaborate on this quote because I truly believe in it. I really believe that everyone is equal to everyone else as long as they are putting in enough work to make it for themselves. People tell me often that they are disgusted with "how smart I am." Damnit, you're blaming your circumstances when you're doing that! Rather than telling me, these individuals could be working harder to do and accomplish the same things that I am. People in general must learn not to waste their time complaining about why they can't do something; they should be using the time instead to gain those "circumstances" that they are looking up to and looking to achieve, and that is the factor that determines true success and fulfillment.
