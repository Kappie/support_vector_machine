BUT AS I'M HERE THINKING OF YOU,  I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW  "I MISS YOU... I'M LOST WITHOUT YOU... I CAN'T DO A THING WITHOUT YOU!"  LOOK YOU MEAN MORE TO ME THEN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.  I KNOW THIS MIGHT SOUND CRAZY,  BUT I'M ONLY CRAZY OVER YOU!  SO PLEASE DON'T RUN OFF AND NEVER SPEAK TO ME CAUSE WILL LEEAVE A MARK FOREVER.  I MISS YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
