You can't find a better source for news and thoughtful theological commentary.    At the moment I'm fascinated by recent interviews with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who doesn't fall easily on either of the sides of the conservative/liberal split in the Communion--or maybe more accurately, is able to take seriously the most pressing critiques of theological revisionists without letting go of his own orthodoxy.       urlLink N. T. Wright  and  urlLink Stanley Hauerwas  have the same ability.  God grant it to us too!
