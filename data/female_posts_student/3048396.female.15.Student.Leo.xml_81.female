What happens if I lose him...Everyones talkin like hes gonna be gone soon. No one knows whats wrong with him. Hes different again and eh. I dunno. To see my mom cry like that make me cry even harder. We can't lose him. If hes not better by NYE I probably wont have the most enjoyalbe time. I'll be worried bout if my Grandpa lives thru the night or not. Hes one family member I've been real close too. I have so much fun with him. He always has me laughing. *Sigh* It hurts. I love him. We can't afford to lose another family member. I dunno if I could take it. My Grandma would probably end up giving up if he was gone. *sigh* Well I can barely see the computer screen the tears are falling so much so Im gonna head...Maybe some sleep will help me. I just hope my Grandpa is alright. Goodnight all.  Tara
