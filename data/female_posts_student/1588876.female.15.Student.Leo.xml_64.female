How can I describe how I feel everytime I hear "The Immigrant Song"? Hmmm...I'll try my damndest. Whenever I hear any song by the Zeppelin, I feel all tingly inside...i get a warm, tingly feeling. I feel the music running through my veins and I just want to go dance naked in the streets and give some bum a couple dollars...or maybe just 0.50 cents if im feeling only a little generous.  Goddammit. Who can compare to Led Zeppelin? Yeah, that's right bitch... NO ONE. I feel overwhelmed (but in a good way) with a feeling of happiness when I hear even the faintest whisper of Robert Plant's sweet sweet vocals.  My heart beats to the rythmic rhythms of John Bonham's glorious drumming.   Who can compare?  NO ONE......     BITCH.
