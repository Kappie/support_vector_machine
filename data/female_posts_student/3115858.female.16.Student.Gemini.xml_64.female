(why go somewhere else to be really fuckin bored when you can stay at home and feel the same way?)    today my dad came in (at like 11:30 this morning) and got me up.  everyone else had left, and he took me driving.  we stopped at hamburger haus in dundee for some ice cream and burgers.  that's the most attention anyone's paid to me all week.
