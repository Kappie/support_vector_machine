Coz I first read CHOBITS was Vol. 3 and the last was Vol. 2... So that means I read Vol. 3 then 5, 6, 7, 8 and then jumped back to 4, 1, 2... Ya, I am a weirdo. Like right now I have two speakers at my computer blasting techno music... Thanks to my  brother . *Grrr* Oh, and 1 Book cost $6 nett. And 8 books together cost about $48. Whoa, I am sure a big spender. ^o~ Ya, I admit, CHOBITS is a little R(A) kinda comic. But this is the only trick to lure those Japanese readers, right? Anyway, initially, I was a little shock by the graphics, but reading repeatedly had made it a small thing. At least it is not as bad as the 'Eechi' or 'Hentai' kinda stuff (No offence). I think.
