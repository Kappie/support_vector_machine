Just watch, I probly signed a form releasing them from all liability and detailing my soul to Ash'koth Daa'baroth, High Unholy Harvester of Souls, upon my untimely and forthcoming death.  Sigh.  Actually, doublesigh.  I wish I had a camera. Like, a good one. There's a shedding tree across the street and I really want to capture it in action. Lest I have to wait until next year. I enjoy photography (pronounced "fo-toe-graa-fee", so as to add some variety).
