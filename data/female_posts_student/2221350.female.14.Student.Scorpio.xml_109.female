THERE IS NOTHING! WE-HAVE-NOTHING! it is so hot and humid, paper airplanes won't fly, but not that it matters, because people can't go outside for fear of contracting some goddamned mosquito virus. "WELCOME TO LOUISIANA. THE ONLY STATE WHERE THE GATORS ARE SCARY, BUT THE SKEETERS ARE SCARIER". i swear to gawd, i hate this town so much i want to burn it down and turn it back into a swamp, because that's all it is... a swamp with a super wal-mart built on it.  ::huffs and puffs for a few minutes::
