Daniel, Alex and I were talking to my mom about a couple of the times we have been drunk and then she asked us what we liked to drink... then she went and bought us beer! It was really wierd. Anyway, Zack came over also. I don't know how much I drank but I know I was drunk. Sarah was too. Daniel and Zack were at least buzzed and my brother was just buzzed. We walked around the neighborhood, and Sarah and I kept having to pee so we ended up peeing in people's yards. I also ran through someones sprinkler. It was quite fun but I don't think it will happen again, at least not with that group because a few wierd things happened. Anyway we didn't end up going to sleep until four in the morning. Mom said we were loud all night but we thought we were being pretty quiet. Zack left at around 9. The rest of us woke up around 11 and then ate a huge breakfast. Daniel had to leave at 1 to go babysit for his sister and Sarah and I have been sitting around doing nothing. She just left too because she had to go babysit.
