So I just had to go to the HS for the marching band run-through of the music. It was interesting.. I had fun though because band is always fun. I got to talk to Jon, which is always interesting. We mostly bicker and make fun of each other, but once in a while we actually get along. =) Jon knows I love him... okay, not really, but you know what I mean. I was so excited though to see what we're playing for Pre-game because  I  suggested "Joy to the World" for marching band. So I was happy. And I pointed this out to Jon, I said, "Guess who suggested this song to Mr. Taylor??" and he says, "I don't know..some moron...ohh..I mean, who??" That just shows you what it's like..   So overall the rehearal was pretty good I guess...I think we have a lot of work to do still, but we have all summer. It feels so weird to be a senior. It's just...strange. But in a way I like it, but I also miss LeeAnne and Chelsie and Brad and all the great seniors. *tear* Oh well.  Then I came home for a while. And Drew got out his sax and was practicing his music already. Well we have this guy, Kenny, re-doing our roof for us, so he was there. And I'm sitting on the computer when all of a sudden I see some kids run by the front window. So I'm like, "Eh..what in the world??" So I look out the front door and I don't see anyone, so I look out the back and it's my neighbor and two of his friends. It turns out the ladder fell.. while Kenny was on the roof!! So I guess he was calling to the neighbors across the street, so thankfully we got his ladder back up for him. He said, "Yeah..I was up there thinking, 'Gee...I wonder how far it is to jump the next house??'" o_O is he crazy!!!? Thankfully he was okay.  Later yesterday I went to LeeAnne's house for Girls' Bible Study reunion type deal. I went over about 2 hours early because she wanted me to. So I went over and she gave me my birthday present early. She got me an awesome card (it's quite funny), a cute bookmark with a nice saying on it, a hilarious book about a chocolate chip cookie, and a photo album. It was pretty sweet. So then we played Tony Hawk because WE ROCK... on the too easy mode...shhh..don't tell anyone. Well it turned out to be just Me, LeeAnne, Rach, and Holly because no one else knew or something, so it wasn't really a reunion. Oh well. We still had fun. So went to Hawley's and got pizza and then back to LeeAnne's and had dessert and we had a devotional time. Then we did those beauty mask things because they're fun and we took pictures of like everything. It was so fun. And then we decided to make a website, so we did. If you really wanna see it, just ask for the URL and I'll give it to you.   Then I got home around 10:30 and helped my parents finish setting up for our garage sale. Then today I did nothing. I woke up around 11:00 and ate breakfast and watched the end of a movie on TV. Then I worked on the ACT practice test while I sat outside at the garage sale. Then I went inside and watched "Ransom" on TV. Then worked on the ACT some more. I did all the practice except for the science, I did the first 5 questions on the science and I got them all right, so I stopped. But so far I've averaged a 30. I hope that I do better tomorrow.   I guess that is all for now. In less than 4 hours I will be 17!! =)
