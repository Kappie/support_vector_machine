After knowing I had 7 projects on Monday, I thought it was bad enough and guess what, that's not the end. Now I have 11 on hand. :) YES! FUCKING 11 PROJECTS TO BE DONE IN WITHIN THE THIRD TO THE TENTH WEEK!! CBCBCBCBBCBCBCB! I can't contain my sorrow anymore... Those fucking subjects can kill me man... Worse still, the teachers said, "It's higher diploma level, no more spoon feeding and you gotta do it the tough way." Kaoz, tough way so be it, the most I flunk all and waste 7k of school fees! PUI!    Oh dear, I think it's time to go shower and brush my teeth now... So sad... I can't write as much as I wanted to now but I hope you guys will continue writing. I read Yvonnes' blog before I wrote this entry. Hee! Lets all GAMBATE! Seeya guys!  Kisskiss!
