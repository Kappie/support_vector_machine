Phrases from the lecture, things people are talking about, things that appeal to me at the time. Sooner or later, a story appears and I simply mold it. I'll add a few words for clearification, or I will add punctuation to make it easier to read. Thats all. Most of the poems you'll read on this site are not merely my own, they belong to my friends, family, and teachers as well. Not to mention a few strangers, just for flavor. I just wanted to give credit, although the poems arn't very good in the first place.  I also wanted to update. I'll have to do that some other time, because right now I have to finish the homework I've been neglecting. God, my spelling is horrible. I really have to work on this, especially if I want to write, or be an english teacher or journalist or something. I suppose there's always spell-check.
