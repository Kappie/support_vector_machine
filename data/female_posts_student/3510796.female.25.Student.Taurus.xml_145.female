But, his family decided to bring over their purebred schnauzer. This high-strung little bastard of a dog positively hates every person who is not a member of Matt's immediate family. So as soon as I walk in the door, I'm greeted by incessant growling, yelping, and snapping. Yeah, that's what I look forward to after a long day of work. I just went about making and eating my dinner as quickly andquietly as possible and spent the rest of the night in my room, otherwise I may have ended up punting the little fucker across the house.       Sunday mornings are now the time for perusing the classifieds. So far, not so good. I'm actually considering responding to an ad for 10-key data entry *shudder*. Just gotta keep looking a little harder. 1 month down and only 2 to go.
