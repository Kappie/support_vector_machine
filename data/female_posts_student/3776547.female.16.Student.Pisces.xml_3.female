Met Randy seams like a nice kid but was acting a bit werid. Like to talk to him again but it prolly won't be until like next week because I am heading off to my Dads for a week. This will be the last time I have to go visit him until Marching Band is over. O yeah I did end up marching in the parade that way my rents would go eariler!...Yeah that is me for ya!...Well I am off to my Dads for the week. If ya need to get ahold of me call me there! 225-4825
