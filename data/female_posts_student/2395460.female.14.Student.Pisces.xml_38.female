After downloading the  urlLink Verisign plug-in , I was able to see the Chinese address in Internet Explorer. Now if only I could read Chinese. You can also use the free  urlLink AsiaSurf Explorer .  Several new domains will become available soon, including .eu (Europe) and .Asia. It's also possible that eventually there will be domains for airline flight numbers (type in your flight no. to get status report) or even retail products.  There are more Asians than North Americans online (223 vs. 175 million users) and only 36% of the world's Internet users are native English speakers, yet 68% of the web's content is in English. Maybe the tide is turning a little. I think I'll look into buying stock at  urlLink NJStar .  Register your Chinese, Japanese, or Korean domain at  urlLink Unicode .
