In the last 2 weeks it has managed to completely fuck up 2 video cards, one monitor, and a hard drive. It's not like it wasn't expected, I've had the damn thing since 2000. I'm just amazed by how rapidly it disintigrated. Got a lovely new flat screen monitor out of it though, and an entirely new (and far suprior) CPU is on order. A third, really good, video card is sitting on my desk right now curtesy of a friend of my dad's. So all should be back to normal soon.  Anyway, last night my dad managed to dump his brand new Harley sportster into a ditch. Fuckin amazing... After dinner, around 9PM-ish he invited me to ride around the city with him. I should've known better, I had just watched him drink nearly an entire bottle of wine at dinner and a few beers before and after. But, idiot that I am, I just got on. He didn't actually crash or anything. We were at the top of our back road and when he stopped and started to lose his balance. The bike was totally stopped, he was just too drunk to hold it up. I put my feet down and stood up hoping I could steady the bike but at that point the bike was leaning too far so I just swung my leg over and stepped back. The bike started to fall, my dad jumped off and we both watched as it slid down into a rocky, muddy ditch. It was a truely awful sight: a beautiful new bike like that, lying on it side in a ditch, lights still on and motor still running. Of course after a minute on it side the bike shut off and after the intitial "Oh fuck, Oh FUCK!" mutterings from both of us we set about pulling it out. I wasn't that hard actually, it's a pretty heavy bike but after we pushed it back up on it's tires it was just a matter of rolling it up the side of the ditch. Once back on the road, we set about swearing and looking for damage. He got luck though, big chunk out of the winsheild and a few tiny scratchs but thats about it. Damn lucky.  I hate riding as a passenger, I figure if I crash it might as well be my fault. At least I'd only have myself to blame.  On to other matters, lot of weird shit with Troy lately. I was almost tired of messing with him last night, he never ceases to piss me off. We have NEVER had a normal conversation, one of us (usually me) fucks everything up and comes out looking like an idiot. Anyway, it's gotten to the point where I avoid my own driveway because everytime I go out there I run into him, and he's still doing that creepy staring shit (so what if I stare back?). It reached an all time low last night, I was taking the trash out and he and his friend were sitting on his front steps. Troy just stopped dead in the middle of talking and just watched me. His freind look confused and tried to get his attention but he just kept staring. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!?  I wasn't even thinking about him this morning. I was eating breakfast and my dad popped in looking excited. "Hey, Troys in the backyard and he looks like fuckin' Aunt Jemima! You have to come see!" Frightenly enough, he was right. He had a bandanna tried around his head old woman style, tied in the front with the little end bits sticking up. Obviously not the bad-ass look he was going for, more like the "I need to keep my hair out of my face while I dust the house" look. Well, it made me feel better.  Spent another day swimming with Alice and Lucia a week ago. I got the sunburn from hell though and my back is still peeling, gross.   I'm going to Canada on Wednesday. Finally, I can get away.  :)
