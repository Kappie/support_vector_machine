We just hung out and watched A Night At The Roxbury. I love that movie! Did you just grab my ass? (Ahh...too many memories with that one!) I'm soooo tired, it's crazy. I hope I'm not getting sick. That wouldn't be good right before prom. I am so excited for prom too! It should be really fun. Erin ended up deciding to go, and that pleased me a ton! I'm glad she's gonna come. We're gonna have a lot of fun. Hmm...I don't have too much more to say. I have a lot of stuff on my mind, but that's about it. Don't really feel like going into detail. Maybe later tho. I don't know. Well, I'm out for tonight.
