Having a storm wake me up and KEEP ME UP is not what I would call enjoyable.  It happened again last night.  Maybe its just me.  But with these storms comes the paranoia that a tree is going to fall on my pretty little house or our dirty little car and we'll be left with nothing. Not to mention every time the thunder crashes it sounds like a bomb and when the lightning flashes through three windows on all sides!    Mommy, I'm scare-ded!!  No  seriously .  I was scared as all get-out!  I actually cuddled against Steve for emotional support, meanwhile all he's thinking - sorry - TALKING - about is, "I wonder if the yard is going to get flooded again..."  Needless to say I didn't sleep well and I'm a little grumpy.  Do these storms happen in the city and we just dont hear it because we're in these big sturdy buildings with no view?  Or does it just happen worse in the suburbs because of ozone levels or some shit?  This I ponder...
