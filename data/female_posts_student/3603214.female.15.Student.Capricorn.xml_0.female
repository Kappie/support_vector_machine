It's gonna suck...I love my one line too...Master, Master! Blessed are the poor in spirit... n that's it...I'm ashamed man...but I guess I can't help it. And it's not my fault I was in the very back of everyone and Loren couldn't see my freakin hand raised for the dumbass better lines. GRRRRRR So yea...I'm done bitchin about it for now. If you wanna come for moral support or w/e, it's August 5-7...7:30...bla bla bla...I don't have a life anymore btw...
