Got major cramps in horseback riding that night, because of period (which always start at the worse times methinks).  Next day, went to see kittens at my cousin's place, swam around in his pool. Went to little sister's 8th grade graduation and to the dance - which was boring, so we left early.  Went bicycling with my friend on Friday to get my order from Sears. Pink scooter (I still think pink is evil, I just don't wear enough and that shade was okay) is what I bought - it's shorts but with a skirt on top (so it's comfortable and pretty). On the way we stopped to school to talk with the Principal.  Decided to work on yearbook again next year, but my best friend will be coordinator (am a little pissed. She always steals the spotlight.) and so will only take 6 courses instead of 7 (she had to discuss those matters with the Principal).  Slept over at friend's house (watched Catch that Kid and The Paycheck), went swimming at her sister's house then came back home to call my dad. He came to get me, and I discovered he'd bought... a mac G5!! Total secret, must not be leaked out because my mom always asks for more money, and if she knew she'd think my dad has plenty and ask for even more.  Slept over, helped cleaning up house and making diner because of Father's Day. Dad tried to convince me (again) that I should be a doctor. Pointed out I didn't take Physics (just for him to get off my back, btw) and that I still planned to become a psy. Little sisters came back from out cottage at 8, went out to Kentucky's to eat.   Daddy said he'd give us 230$ for me to help my sister - let's name her Evil - for her summer courses in math. Evil decided she wanted a bow. Am v. suspicious of her intentions. Also said she wanted a go kart. Pointed out we didn't have a track. Bow+go kart? I'll have to analyze this case further...
