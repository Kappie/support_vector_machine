"You're young and you have your whole life ahead of you." 5. "Hey, (insert some boys name here) is kinda cute. What about him?" 6. "You will meet someone new in...THAILAND." (thank you, mother) 7. "HAHA, you're all ALONE!" (thank you, brother) 8. Bitching about problems you have with your boyfriend/girlfriend. 9. "You wanna smoke/drink?"  #'s 1 and 2 will get you a nice, firm bitch slap. Why? Because no one fucking talks about him like that. It's between us, anyway. The only person I really want to talk to about all of this is him. #'s 3-7 will get you the eye roll/middle finger combo. Those are either the most cliche, stupid or mean things one can say. # 8 will get you the silent treatment. Are you two still together? Yes, now hush. # 9 will get you get you a nice "Jesus is my savior" booklet. I have plenty of them saved up as a joke. Now you are the joke. I haven't had any booze (besides the usual sip) since March. I only had 4 cigarettes and half a Black and Mild that night. I don't want to chain smoke. Suprise, suprise, but I'm not addicted and I don't want to be. And as for weed. I don't want artificial happiness. I want to deal with this pain soberly.  I am giving myself two weeks to be hermit. It's best to get my feelings out immediatley, rather than act fake and tough. When people do that, they end up having mental breakdowns in the end. FUN! "For well you know that it's a fool  who plays it cool  By making his world a little colder" HEY JUDE! AMEN! I know everyone won't agree with me, but this is how I deal with things. I'm not giving up. I'm on a...vacation.  It's Psychology time! YAYYYYYYYYYYYYAYYYYYYYY! I wish I had more textbooks. I need history textbooks. I want me brainfood!!!! :boogie:  I could not sleep yesterday! I hardly ever get scared of movies but the Shining really creeped me out. Eww, that old nasty naked broad. !!!!!!!!!! BARF!!!!!  Haha, Tsedey said California sucks...except for the palm trees. Mmmkay, I wouldn't know.
