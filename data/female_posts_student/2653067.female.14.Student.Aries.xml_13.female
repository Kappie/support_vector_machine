This is what I saw from the "Next time on the OC" clip: Something is going to happen inbetween Julie and Caleb (a marriage?), Marissa and Ryan are going to get back together, Something will happen with Sandy and Jimmy's deal and best of all, there will be a "Tragic accident" and one of the characters of the show could be gone for ever!  Oh man, I can't wait t'ill next week.  I wonder who will be in the accident?  Ryan? Seth? Marissa? Eddie? Theresa? Summer? The list can go on.  Anywho, I'm going to get some shut eye.  See ya later!
