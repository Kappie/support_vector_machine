Makes me forget how, for the last 4 years, all ive ever known this place to be was a wet, angry little city. I think maybe one of the reasons why i love this hot hot weather is because it reminds me so much of home. hahaha.. yes, i still get homesick after all these years ... Before he himself had a taste of living in a foreign country, my brother Mahathir could never see the logic in me coming home every year. He thought it was just a waste of money .. and time. He says i'd be better off using the money i used to go home to go travelling or something. Hah .. he's been here for the last 9 months or so .. and methinks he now sees why i yearn to go home all the time, because the exact same thing is happening to him. Goes to show that my bro is not exactly half as adventurous as he would like to think!  Confession : i did not do any studying last night. Is that bad??? I do feel kinda guilty now because now .. every minute, every second counts. But last night i think i just didnt have the motivation to do anything. I wasnt sleepy so i didnt go to bed early. I was just .. bored. I made myself a simple dinner of prawn-flavoured fried rice to which i added some tuna and ate with cherry tomatoes ( god .. i love these!!!) and some coleslaw... and turned the telly on. I wasnt even motivated to watch tv but i just turned it on anyways. I watched some bits of 'City of Angels' which i think is a whole load of crap .. last night was the second time ive watched it and i still dont think the idea of an angel falling in love with a mortal is at all romantic.. d-uh ..Then the last episode of 'Human Mutants' which i missed last week was on. There were a lot of repetitions in the programme, as in they keep saying the same things over and over again. i dont even want to talk about what they showed in the prog cos it was all too boring and did not add any useful knowledge to register in this perpetually cluttered brain of mine. After that i watched some bits of BIG BROTHER which was kinda boring as well cos i wasnt following it as closely as zak does .. gosh .. this friend of mine is an avid fan of big brother hehehe.. In the end i decided to take a hot shower.. and went to bed after spending almost an hour with zak on d phone. I do know the underlying reason for my low mood last night .. and i am kinda annoyed with myself for letting it interfere with my revision.
