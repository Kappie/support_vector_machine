We met up with Brett Harden (aw i love him yall) and Jermiah (i love you too) and Mackenzie...great I dont know how to spell his name. But it was pretty darn cool. The fireworks....were so pretty. I had to get Adrienne to still go b/c she was gonna go with Tristan but...he was too sick to go out so she was upset..but I told her she'd still have a blast with us and I think she did :)..I'm glad she still went. Aw, I love her and I hope things work out for her and Tristan. I do feel bad b/c Erik Burkett wanted to go with us and he couldn't..but that's a long story.. :). We all laid on Adrienne's cover she brought...lol..was pretty big..and just looked up at the sky...I love the end of the fireworks..the last ones .. you can always FEEL them...it's so great. And we stole Bretts coke..which wasn't nice of us b/c he paid 2 bucks for a coke... :( he's so sweet yall! I really hope this group can hang out more.  K so I come home and Monica's here...been here for hours..lol readin magazines...we get on the computer and matt valentine msgs me and he wants to stop by and say hey to us so we talked to him a few min outside and then they left and I'm here and I'm talkin to monica adrienne and brad. I loved today pretty much.
