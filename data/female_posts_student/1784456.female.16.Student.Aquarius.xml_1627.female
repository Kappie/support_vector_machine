Mmm... might make the pina colada taste funny though. Anyway... oh wait, I still don't have a point. Paragraph spree! I slept for five hours so I'm less sleep deprived *or derived?* but still totally crazy! Heeey I was wondering *uhoh* when people are the opposite of you does that mean that you shouldn't get along? (in english-more likely to not get along) *spell check on opposite... bing correct* I used to think that everyone could be friends with everyone else, but it's truer if you say everyone can tolerate everyone else, but then that's not always true! Ahh, but you might as well try. Anyway, I should probably stop pretending that I know something... and that my brain's not just a pile of grey goo. *hey, mine's probably grey goo with pink strips!* Mmm brains...
