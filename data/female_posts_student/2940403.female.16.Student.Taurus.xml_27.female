She "un"fortunately knows how to cheer me up... but it makes me feel fat.  :(   Oh well.  Jess gave me a nice candle today... which I really REALLY needed because it smells good and it can hide the smelly kitty litter odor.  And a cool picture frame that I don't have any pics to put in.  Then Chelsea gave me a cool birthday drawing of a cute guy.   :)   She can draw awesome pics.  Scott: i came home and ate m notsohotchick911: i ate a brownie cake Scott: brownie cake eh notsohotchick911: yeah notsohotchick911: it's really good Scott: how can it be both? Scott: it hasta be more  one than the other notsohotchick911: okay fine, they're brownies with a big pile of chocolate whipped cream in the middle and chocolate chips that you dip the lil brownie pieces in notsohotchick911: i didnt get a birthday cake so IT'S A CAKE Scott: lol Scott: brownies are better than cake anyways notsohotchick911: yes they are :-) Scott: its condensed cake notsohotchick911: lol Scott: yep   So yeah... I put that in there 'cos I was bored.  I still am.  Today I was falling asleep in science as usual and I started thinking about all this bacteria stuff we're going over since I'm into this kind of stuff, and I thought that if a virus needed a host to reproduce... what makes us any different?   Maybe ... it's like the Matrix kind of.  Our thoughts aren't in our bodies... maybe we're just hosting the bodies and reproducing?  Does that make any sense?  I doubt it... even now that I'm thinking about I have no idea what I was thinking... or wasn't thinking?   My head is numb again...
