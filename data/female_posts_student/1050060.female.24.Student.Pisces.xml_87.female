So i did and it turned out pretty good.  So after that we took the bus but then i realized we took the wrong bus. It was pretty funny. Anyways the bus took us to down town and not to the university. So my friend decided to get a lip piecing that she always wanted. Then we came back to the school. So that what happened today other then school. Have to go because i have to get home. Have a good day!
