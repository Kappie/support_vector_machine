Truth be told, mine hasn't been too bad, except for me AAAAH not havingthe scarf   But everyone's breaking up.... which means that there is an awful lot of bad stuff swirling in my locale. And that the spite wars are far from over.  I think tomorrow I will wear my "Boys are Stupid, Throw Rocks at Them!" t-shirt. I love this shirt, despite the fact that it is baby blue, which is an incredibly unflattering color for me. I wanted the original one i saw in some magazine, which was pink, but alas, I could not locate the store.   When shopping, or dragging the Schnig around the mall, or something like that, I came upon this shirt in a store I normally would never have gone into.... and I had to have it. Yes, I was shopping with a boyfriend, but WHAT A GREAT SHIRT.  It is the shiznit. It is bodacious and tubular. It is so very.  I never actually wore it in front of HIM until after the breakup.   Man, i treat that kid horribly. I ignore him like, um, an ignoring thing..... I mean, I smirk whenever he attempts to address me and ignore him even when he opens doors for me.... I mean, he opens the door at school in the morning because it's locked, and that's what you do, you open the door for people in the morning who want to get into the school, not because he's being chivalrous or some crap like that, as I had previously thought. See, he tends to make rather odd friendships in which he insists on carrying stuff and helping people all the time. SOOOOO obviously he will open the door for everyone, but he'll run faster if they are a)cool or b)pretty or c)not me, since I am obviously both *cue hair flip*.  He doesnt' do it on purpose. Of course it isn't his fault he metaphorically pantsed me, punched me in the chest a few times, kicked my stomach repeatedly, and somehow removed my heart, ran over it, backed up, and did it again, only to attempt a hug.....   But I still cannot bring myself to greet him.
