My butt was screaming in excruciating pain just a quarter of an hour ago...LS too much liao..hehee. What did I makan? Maybe the flower crabs? Or maybe cos I'm getting crappy..alamak. Nonsensical me. Today seemed to be a terribly physically-challenged day. My right ankle is sprained, my left calf has this acute sharp pain during locomotion and my arse is in pain after 2 power dumps. HAhaha.. Hmm.. actually physical torment is nothing yea? At most I just grit my teeth n close my eyes  tomorrow will be a better day ( if not the next, the next and the next day). Or maybe it's capital punishment for my nua-ness? I'm trying to be oblivious to that 5 stack of unkempt notes from erm yr 2000? hiakz.. my mum is screaming at me to pack up.. Bleah. I feel like a man really, I talk like one too..Oh and I THINK I like women too.. Woah. This ain't good news. LOL Well, still I do retain the rudimentary (haha hear that) aspects and asserts of a female, I still do love shopping (erm..I think some men love that too), I love wearing skirts and most of all I still love erm THE ____. (Please fill in the blanks where possible..muahahah-- baby I know u will call me and ask). I'm so bloody lazy..cannot take it. I have to hang my head in shame when plp come to my room and ask if its my brother's room *gasp*  oh well... yea...whatever...now the afternoon insulin surge is kicking in...all the blood rushing to my gut... (or maybe somewhere else? *winks*)  ok ok, too much innuendoes! Zhou gong beckoning moi to play chess liao...laterzzz....
