It is such a beautiful day, and it made me happy when I got up, but Jerm gets all conflicted and guilty on nice days because he thinks he has to be outside to appreciate it, and then thinks about all of the things he *has* to do, and ends up making me feel like shit. I was just looking forward to hanging around the house with all of the doors open and working casually on my paper that's due tuesday and hanging out laundry on the clothesline. Why does Jerm always have to make lazy days into this huge fucking ordeal? Who the fuck cares? Why do I have to feel guilty and bad because he can't fucking make up his mind? Sometimes he's can be so damned dramatic and pathetic and it pisses me off enough to swear in writing. And since doesn't care enough to read this, he'll never know how much I rant about him.   Sorry, end of my bitching and moaning about my relationship, which is generally very good. I'm just having a particularly bitter moment, since I was just made to feel guilty for having some "alone time" and taking a freaking shower. I mean really, WTF? I'm sorry I don't drop everything to be selfless the moment Jerm wants me to. Okay, really, I'm done. Anyone else want to rant about their significant others/dating in general?
