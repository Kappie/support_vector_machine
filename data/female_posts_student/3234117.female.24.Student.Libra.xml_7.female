Last week was not so good, with only a total of 7 hours.  I really should work my 14 hours.  I'll probably go shopping instead.  I want a shirt like  urlLink this .  Except I want it a little shorter and brown to go with the pink capri pants I bought yesterday from Express.  I saw a girl wearing this outfit and I want it.    On another topic, I found a practicum site for the Fall! Thanks to good ole' dad.  I'll be volunteering at Positive Pain Management in Garland.  And yes I did say volunteering.  The kids from UNT doctoral psychology program get a paid practicum.  Hopefully they'll realize the absurdity of this and pay me as well.  I'm really excited about it even if I don't get paid!  Even more exciting is I'll get to learn about hypnosis!   So far my dateless day number 1 has been good.  Tonight I've been offered to go out to Sherlocks with Chelsea and Sofia to dance and have wicked, good fun!  Sofia and her boyfriend of 6 or 7 months just broke up so she needs a night of summer lovin!  I still haven't decided if I will go or not.  I'm actually thinking about staying in tonight and watching my Friday night line up and ordering a pizza.  I haven't been able to stay at home on a Friday night and watch my shows in a long, long time so I'm actually sort of looking forward to that.  But it is fun to go out dancing with my girls!  But I don't think I have anything to wear.    I've also been looking for apartments for when my lease is up in October.  I've been trying to convince Ben, my future roommate, to move in with me to Estancia Townhomes.  My mom is trying to convince me to move back home.  Now this is not going to happen.  I would definitely be dateless many, many more days.  When Travis and I decided to go to Cozumel together after we had been dating over a year, my dad thought it would be appropriate to book us in a room with double beds.  First mistake-- don't let your dad book your trip.  So I'm pretty positive it would not be conducive to live at home and have a relationship.  So Ben, I'm not joking.
