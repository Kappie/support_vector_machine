It's gonna be sweet getting away from everyone, just getting to walk on the beach and do WHATEVER I WANT without anyone to tell me what to do, how to do it, where, when, all that other crap you have to put up with in school. It's going to be cool playing summer league basketball too...Anyway, just had to share the joy of school ending with anyone who reads this (probably no one), but anyway...
