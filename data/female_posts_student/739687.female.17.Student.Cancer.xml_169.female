Life will seem to you, later, not a lesser, but a greater thing.  D. H. Lawrence   Hmm...it's like all my thoughts on religion put quite simply into words.   If you can't have faith in what is held up to you for faith, you must find things to believe in yourself, for a life without faith in something is too narrow a space to live.  George E. Woodberry   How true.   People ask for criticism, but they only want praise.  W. Somerset Maugham   And will I EVER agree to that statement.   I can remember when the air was clean and sex was dirty.  George Burns   BAH HAH. Quite humorous.   Assert your right to make a few mistakes. If people can't accept your imperfections, that's their fault.  Dr. David M. Burns   I am careful not to confuse excellence with perfection. Excellence, I can reach for; perfection is God's business.  Michael J. Fox   If your success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your heart, it is not success at all.  Anna Quindlen   Hmm...sometimes I feel like that. Like when everyone tries to implant this impression of my so-called "success" into my head...or when they tell me what I have to do to be "successful"...and sometimes, I just don't feel like I have to be THAT person to be successful in life.   Well, that's enough quotes for now. Until next time, crazies.
