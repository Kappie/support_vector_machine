I'm floating... wahahaha *_*   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    a weird day ... filled with mixed feelings... beautiful windy weather...   Hehe~ had a mini and a little pathetic Racial Harmony carnival today. Was slightly late for the Racial Harmonytalk in the audi... Oh my goodness! So paisei... my friends and I thought that we had to be seated by 10 instead of 9.45. Happily we marched in at 10 plus, by that time almost everyone was seated and the principalhad just begun her presentation. Wow~ thousands of eyes watched us like hungery vulgers waiting to attack small little preys... However, luckily we managed to pull through this tiny 'ordeal'. hehe...   Then my friends and I proceeded to the foyer after the talk... Iparticipated in the Indian decor activity.Each of us took some coloured rice grains and laid them out according to the authentic flowery template that was placed on the floor. Wow~ wonderful experience... although it'sa rather tedious job.     Following that... hey hey~ wetook a stroll around the runningtracks in school. So romantic right?! haha...we chit chatted along the way as the wind blowed in our direction. Goodness~ as thoughwe were having a vacation on Cameron Highlands. It'sdefinitely an experience that one shouldnever miss out... I believe that such precious moments willdefinitely makeup part of the sweet memories I have with my friends. In fact, such a scenario reminds me of thetittle of the book ' A walk to remember  ' ...Iwould encourage you guys out there to read it...   It'sa sweet story about family,FRIENDS and thedifferent characters you meetdaily. How one gain acceptance by provingoneself... and to stay strong regardless of whateversetbacks you have faced. It's a simple yetcomplicated love story... Extremely touching~   Yup yup... I'm getting a little worried now... My dad will have to go for another mini op. tomorrow. I cross my fingers and pray hard that there won't be any complications... Hopefully the surgeon of Changi Hospital will avoid medical negligenceunlike the last time. I can't accpect another blow... it's too painful to watch your love one suffer for nothing... . Hopefullyafter this mini op... another round of check up and bi-opsy willcarry through smoothly too. I pray that there won't beany undesirable outcome... although chances are low... but there's still a slight possibility. Anyway, what I can do now is to give him the moral support and to provide him with some advices... which may be of some use. yesh...    tata... [=^_^=]
