(Desperation, Dark Tower IV: Wizar and Glass, Salems' Lot, and The Shining all by Stephen King and i just started Shadowland by Peter Straub. how i love a good thrill novel. that reminds me, the last thing my strange blonde friend and i did, was get flung up 350 feet in the air, and strung about by a couple of seats, a ride called 'the slingshot'. again, good times.  s0o0o0o0o0o...i guess you're being bored to death by meaningless things, so, c ya
