I barely talked to David :( Deeann isnt moving in with Ian until her birthday, but they did stay together last night, and she sounded like she was so happy...they are gonna be so happy living together! I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more today...Jessica's home!! Thank gosh!! I was about to go crazy! Its kinda storming right now...I really don't like stormy weather, ever since the wreck thunder frightens me. Where is David...I miss him. I'm head over heals over that boy, I love him so much...ah...he has won my heart. I think that Dustin and his band are really gonna go far, Dustin has a great voice and can really play the guitar...all they need is a Drummer...lol!   Music I'm listening to now: I'm moving on By: Rascal Flatts  Thats a really great song. Tomorow I am going up to the school to work ojn some of my make up work...Especially biology. And to get my review sheets...Whitesboro is really bad about getting your work to you when you ask for it. I mean Mrs. Cheney told me that she would get reviews from all my classes and give them to David but did she? NO...he only got one and I already had that one!! They did the same thing to me right after the wreck.   My mood right now: Longing...I miss David...but I'm also in a good mood...that just generally is me tho...lol  Back to my day...hopefully David will come over before work tomorow, and on break tomorow...Erik is home today! I don't know where hes been but its definately been different without him on the net all the time, Cuz I talk to him about alot of stuff. Ive been wondering where Tim is?! TIM WHERE ARE YOU!?! I really wanna get out...go to the pool...go somewhere...I cant stand being at home all day every day and I cant see how anyone can do that!! AH I might get to be in a band! Victor Smith(excuse me if I spelled anything wrong in that) is going to give me violin lessons, as yall know I already play, but he's givin me lessons so I can get better. And his band is looking for a singer, so of course my mom told him that I sing and he wants to hear me sing!! How awesome is that? This is like a once in a lifetime chance, well not really cuz I'm sure if i wanted to I could be in Dustin and Micheal's band!! I wish David would call me back!! Grrr... Dont you hate it when guys do that...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Guys confuse me at times...lol.   "I'm full of fly shit"--Dustin Mozingo  Thats one of the famous quotes of this day...not really its just a really funny story behind it.  Its back to the doctor for me on thursday...which I really cant wait cuz once mama sees that my results are negative i can go out and have fun!! That is until I have the surgery...wow this has been a long post...If any thing eventful happens tonight, I'll come write another one for today...Love yall!!
