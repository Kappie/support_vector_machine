Today, i go to band camp...about 10 minuts ago it would have been that tomorrow im going to band camp...consitering its 12:10 AM >_  yesterday/today sorta...i went to my aunt cheryl(spelling?) and uncle vince's house for a suprize aniversary party that my cousin threw for them. it was fun, and i once again brought up my love of flight and got myself into another peice of that. Its a bummer, my other uncle(ron), who is a flght fan himself, went to the Dayton air show, where as i had not. I had been tempted to call thim that weekend to see if he was going, but i decided not too, and i supose i should have. alwell, no use in crying over it..its done and overwith. and besides, im looking forward to going to a different air show in about a month anyway...of course, it all depends on how it works out.   its kind of funny though, i struck up a convorsation with my aunt jane about how i had gone to the USAF musuem, and when i mentiond to her, the feeling i got when i sat in that mock up cockpit (the tottaly awesome overwhlming oh my god this is so cool feeling), she popped the question "have you ever consiterd being a pilot then?"..i decided not to hold back on my answer and finnaly let it out instead of the usual shrug.."Actually yes i really want too...ive like the idea of doing so since i was in 5th grade"..which is the truth...(suprize to any of my siblings who might end up reading this)  it was then that the night started turning around. my uncle ron stated talking to me about it, and my uncle vince gave me a bunch of old books on planes when he found out about the fact that i was into planes..my dad mentiond me loving planes and flight while family and friends where sitting around talking and stuff..man..not to long ago did i have the first few steps of finnaly cutting loose the worries of what people thought and finnally took a dive into all this...i really feel like this is what i want to do/follow in my life. :-\  then there are times i look at myself in the mirror and wonder how that girl i see could ever end up doing something like that...and then there are the times when i look at the girl and think about how she had such a cool dream shes finnaly going for..*sigh*...not to mention, the election thing going on. Im for Kerry, especially after watching a large parth of the democratic convention. they had some awesome speakers there, and i agreed with almost everyhing they said. i dont think im going  bother watching the republican convention..i might just die from it ---> x_X ...that reminda me of some awesome news...my family is going to go see kerry today..that is..in 12 and plus hours...i wont be going..because of death camp..aka band camp..but my dad, mom, sister, and hoppfully both my brothers will get to go.   you know what, i think i know why tonight has been such a crazy night..its full moon..not to mention, a blue moon. and on the night of the 1st of August, the month of which this year will have a friday the 13th O.o thats just creapy..anyway, i think im going to go to bed...cuz in 10  hours, im off to the school to load up for band camp..and whill have officially have left the house just before 11:30..  ill cya later..iom a bout a week or more..  -Rachel, aka Phoenix
