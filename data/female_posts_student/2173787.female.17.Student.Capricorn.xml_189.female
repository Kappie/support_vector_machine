Every week the producers of the show take average looking women and do massive surgery and life restructuring to turn them into possible beauty queens.  A woman who was maybe a little over average weight was given liposuction in 5 different areas, had her face restructured in plastic surgery, given false veneers over her existing teeth and 3 months with a personal trainer to make her look beautiful.  Instead of looking at someone and seeing the beauty they carry with them this show teaches us to look at people and see what they could be with some help from some very skilled surgeons.  This show is not real life, yet raises the bar for the rest of the world pushing expectations and possibilities.  I don't look at these girls and say wow, isn't that amazing, I look at these girls and say wow that's atrocious.  There are people in this world who deal with serious cosmetic flaws, they do not look average, and I'm not saying that cosmetic surgery is evil.  But to totally remake someone who does not look bad, just because its possible to make them look better is sickening.  What hope does it give to everyone else when they see someone who looks similar to themselves go through millions of dollars worth of surgery for no better reason than that they were picked by a TV show.  These women claim to have no self esteem because of the way they look, but what will they have in 5 years when the surgery begins to sag and decay?  Maybe instead of focusing on our exteriors we should move within ourselves and begin working there.  Lack of self esteem is an awful thing, but fleeting beauty is not the way to solve it.
