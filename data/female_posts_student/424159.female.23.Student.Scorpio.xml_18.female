I had seen a guitar on sale that I really really wanted in  urlLink Musicians Friend magazine , and I was going to buy it when I got my tax return back.  After work today, I went to Sam Ash, which was having a sale, for the sole purpose of scoping out prices of the guitar I wanted.  Lo and behold, they had the exact same guitar I wanted.  And it was cheaper.  I bought the fucking thing.  A Squier Affinity Stratocaster, made by Fender.  Blue.  She's very beautiful.   urlLink This is what she looks like.   I need to come up with a name for her.  Suggestions?   UPDATE:  5/26/02  - I have named her Abby.
