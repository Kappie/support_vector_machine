Monday is all right, Tuesday quite ok, Wednesday completely alone, Thursdaywas so lousy. Tomorrow can't be any better.    I found myself once andonce again influenced by comments ofall different sorts. Negative comments mainly. There were all kinds of comments from classmates which I sometimes found really very true. Some of the few like:huiqian dun care about anybodyelse other than jaslyn, jaslyn is not really friendly except to huiqian they all... All kinds. All sorts. All so true. All which I found was so depressing. Whenever I seek company, I first go to yuhui, who is already taken by szehui. Then I go find huiqian, then she went off with jaslyn. Ying ge is with Qiying and her constanting staring and growing wide eyes are always warning me off. Pamela went with Fanqin, then janice they all...Sigh.Nomatter how hard I try, I eventually will always end up alone. I stared at them, unnoticed by anyone who ever cares. Because there's nobody. Inthis class of 2/7, there's nobody at all. Nobody who cares toopen their eyes wide tosee the situation.Nobody...    Then I realised I am doing a wrong thing, I'm reading Jaslyn's blog. Whenever I read it, I only sank more into depression. Because I'm never existant in her eyes other than some days, I'm never mentioned. I'm only forgotten. Had she ever observed her surroundings? Only once in a while. Once in a while she will remember me and in the next moment, I'm forgotten again. There was a news going on in the class which everybody is keen on. That is that on national celebrations, we're baking cookies to sell! Something very fun for everybody else. Something very depressing for me. Baking cookies, it requires help more than anything else. I turned around and saw that everybody was so excited. I asked. But my question was ignored. I really wonder how I will pass that day trying to help, but to no avail.    I really don't know what to do, how to survive in this world...
