Lizaki and I went out last night for a few martini's to relax and chill and vent and those turned into about 4 vodka sodas in the crew bar.  nonetheless, it was fun.  We hung with my german friend, Nils. I mean Nilanaki.  Hehehe.  We have been here in this internet cafe for a few hours and it's cool.  We have such a good time together. This chick is so cool. Such a good friend  - I can't wait for her to meet AJ - god. How cool my two closest friends meeting.  So, Lizaki is coming to Texas - on the 1st of June.  And staying until the 5th.  Then we leave.  We leave, for a week.  Okay, I know, I know, everyone is probably like WHAT??? You are leaving, you just got here? Well, we found out that we can cruise on other ships for $10 bucks a day and so we have decided to go to Bermuda. Well, I have decided that a Bermuda trip is in order.  We have 3 overnights in Bermuda on the Horizon and I am planning to relax like all these assholes on our ship.  Just chill. So we will fly to Philadelphia on the 5th and head to Bermuda on the Horizon ship. I booked my flight today and so did Lizaki. So, I am psyched.  So, I will arrive on the 30th because I am overnighting in San Fran with my therapist friends.  I will sleep after a great dinner with lots of wine with my new family - Richard  My mom (they got Married yesterday!! I am sooo happy for them!!) and then Lisa arrives in Houston at 8:38AM on the 1st.  We will then begin our party fiasco.  Starting with an excellent brunch with Alan and Bob and hopefully my prego friend, Becka and then make plans for the evening.  I am hoping to head to Austin early in the morning on the 2nd and wake up AJ for a massive smoke out. Hehehe. Then to Tejas cafe with Lisa (from Austin) and Lizaki and hopefully Kevin, etc. etc. to enjoy some great mimosas.  Drink out our hearts and prepare for the evening.  Maybe Echoset can throw a show together so I can bathe in their limelight and enjoy their company.  If nothing else, we will scoot our asses to 6th street, drink and show Lizaki how the Texans/Americans party. And then off we go - back out into the open. Stay until the 4th, head to home to Houston and depart out of IAH to Philadelphia to board our vacation vessel.  Off to Bermuda.  God, I am so excited. This girl just makes me crazy - I have never in my life had such a kickass friend that just gets me more than anyone.  She can piss me off in a second but make me smile the next.  It's cool as shit to be in Mexico and hanging with one of your closest getting drunk.   It's fun as hell.  I can't wait to see you all though.  And I am even more excited that you will get to meet her. Granted we may speak our own language when we get there - Ella, Entax, Parakalo.  But no worries because you will all learn soon.  Heheheh.   PADDY!!!!!  HOw's Texas coming along??? Shit, I have missed everything for the last few months.  I feel out of the loop but I can't wait to tell you ALL about my adventures.  We have some incredible stories.  I am so happy here. Never been happier.  I miss you all but damn, it's cool here. I didn't realize it until a few days ago when I was getting ready to sign my signoff sheet for May 29th.  I am blogging the hell out of this site. Sorry.    For why. For why because I said for why.  I love you all.  i love you. i love you.  thank you for helping me get here. without you i wouldn't be here. i love you all.  yours, the dumbest craziest drunkess american.   oh yeah, my friend Jason says,m "Don't you remember in the 80's when alcoholism was light and breezey??" hahahahahahahahaha.
