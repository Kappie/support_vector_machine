I have calmed down a lot, that was just me venting, however I meant every word... Last night was extrae-extrae cool... I was really bored.. and I didn't look at my N Sync video in about 4 years.. (yes I have an N Sync video.. i have 2 BSB ones as well...) so I put it on after Hum Kisise Kum Nahin (which was utter crap, Aish looked HEAVENLY though)... and .. my bro being the childish shit he is... started dancing... and me being the childish shit that I am.. jumped on his back while he was dancing... which resulted in him running all around the house with me on his back... and eventually leading to a fight...it was soooooooooo cool.. was a really good work out .. haha.. i dont need to go the gym when i have michael and n sync around!.. haha..
