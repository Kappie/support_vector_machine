Something hit me after I read  this  article.  I have been studying Biblical prophecy at length recently, and I am struck by the fact that I cannot locate anything concrete or specific with regard to the United States, or even the Western Hemisphere, in prophecy.  Then it occured to me: what if there's a reason for that?  This country was, after all, founded upon Christian principles--and despite a rather loud minority, the majority of the people in this nation are, in fact, Christian.  Not only is the US the most powerful nation in the world, but it is one of the few nations left that remains a staunch supporter of Isreal.  As we are fighting this war on terror, it is becoming abundantly clear that there are two groups of people that these fundamentalists want dead--Christians, and Jews.  They want to destroy the United States, and they want to destroy Isreal.  No matter how hard they try, they will never fully destroy the Jewish people, because Isreal is God's prime piece of real estate, and they were, and are, His chosen people.  We Gentiles have just been blessed enough to be invited in on the Word and the chance for salvation.  But could they destroy us?  Not easily, I don't believe--and certainly not unless it was on God's timetable.  What I mean by that is this--there is a certain event referred to as The Rapture of the Church.  This is differentiated from the Second Coming of Christ, as it refers to the moment in which Christ appears in the clouds, and all His believers are "caught up with Him".  The idea behind this is that God has not appointed His believers to the wrath of the coming 7 years of Tribulation, when the antichrist will appear and claim to be God.  The basis for this is  1 Thessalonians 4 ,  1 Corinthians 15 , and  Luke 17: 34-36 .  This does not imply that the Christian Church will not undergo some form of tribulation; it simply means that God would not wish to have His children be on earth as it comes to a rather horrifying end.  And even then, God will provide two witnesses to preach the Truth and the Gospel, in order to bring those left behind into the Light.  There will be Tribulation Saints, people who refuse to deny Christ and as a result suffer greatly under the antichrist dictator.  But their souls will be lifted up to the Lord in Heaven as well, and their reward great for enduring such suffering.   "Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill   you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name." (Matthew 24:9)  *There is much debate about the Rapture: is it before, during, or after the Tribulation?  To me, it really doesn't make that much of a difference.  The point is, there are several things that must happen in order to usher in the End Times and the Great Tribulation.    Think about this: what if the Rapture were to occur tomorrow, or in the next moment?  What if, rather suddenly, hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people were to dissapear?  As the majority of people in this country are Christian, the United States will have just dissapeared.  Several people have spoken of and written about this event-namely, the Left Behind series.  But what if a more likely scenario occured instead of millions of people just vanishing into thin air?  The evil terrorists are already planning another attack on the U.S., and according to top sources, they wish it to be even more horrendous than 9-11.  There is talk of them using weapons of mass destruction.  We have been informed not, under any circumstances, to underestimate these threats.  What if the unthinkable were to happen?  What if the terrorists were to be successful in that endeavor, but through a combination of their abilities and God's plan, only Christians in this country died?  What if, through that seemingly horrible event, God was actually rescuing His Church from the wrath to come?  There could not be a more appropriate time for the ultimate deceiver to arise.  What would happen?  The world would fall into chaos.  The world economy would collapse.  Masses would demand retribution for the hateful act, and would, presumably, need a very powerful, charismatic leader to control society.  In order to finally end the war on terror, this seemingly peaceful man (who is in fact, the antichrist) would say something like this:  "This is an act of injustice, against one of the greatest nations on this earth.  These evil men who commit these deeds must not go unpunished--look what they have done.  They have killed innocent, God-fearing people.  What's next?  We must finally put an end to the violence in the middle east.  With the help of so-and-so and such-and-such organization, we can do just that.  We can at last finish this "Road Map to Peace", and work with the Palestinians in signing a final peace accord with Isreal.  Then, and only then, will we finally achieve peace on this earth."  WRONG.  There will never be peace, until Christ returns.  But this seemingly helpful leader will deceive all the nations, and confirm that "peace" covanent with Isreal.  He will stamp down on terror.  Think about it--what if the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, was gone?  There would be no freedom left.  A powerful, one-world government would arise in order to combat the remaining terrorist organizations.  The dollar will have collapsed, and everybody will probably adopt the Euro.  (By the way...did you know that even as of today the Euro is stronger than the dollar?  Did you know that more and more nations are joining the European Union?)  People will be forced to have their social security numbers implanted under their skin, in order to tract down terrorist activities and prevent the smuggling of arms and money.  You wouldn't be able to buy or sell anything without it.  The problem is, if you were to accept the mark...well, it's the mark of the Beast, so DON'T ACCEPT IT.  There would be no freedom, but hey--everybody would be "safe!"  People at that point would sacrifice personal freedom for saftey, because who wants to be destroyed by weapons of mass destruction?   "The day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night [at an unsuspected time]. For when they shall say, "Peace and safety!" then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman" -1 Thessalonians 5: 2-3  Well, 3 1/2 years after the antichrist confirms the covanent with Isreal, he will ruthlessly break it--he will stand upon the Holiest of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple, and declare himself to be God.  And unlike anything God would do, he will demand that everyone bow to him and the Beast (Satan.)  If you do not, you'll die.  Physically, yes--but not spiritually, because everyone who remains faithful in Christ will never face eternal death.   "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains." --Jesus, (Mark 13:14 KJV)    "He opposes and exalts himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, and even sets himself up in God's Temple, proclaiming himself to be God." (2 Thessalonians 2:4)   "Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.  At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.  For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.  So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time." --Jesus, (Mark 13: 6, 21-23)  After the antichrist breaks the covanent, all hell will break loose. (literally)  A third of the earth's population will die, and just when things get to the point that everyone wonders if they can take much more, Jesus Christ will return to earth on the Mount of Olives, smile, and say "I'm back..."  That's when the world will finally have true peace, with the Prince of Peace.  Jerusalem will become the Garden of Eden again, the lion will lay down with the lamb, there will be no sadness, and no war.  And the best part is, Christ will be our King! :-D  Anyway, long story made very long...my point is this: I truly believe that when the end of the world does come, the United States will probably no longer be on the earthly scene.  Every empire before us eventually collapsed, and I have no reason to doubt ours would as well.  The Bible makes it very clear that the Christian Church will not be around during earth's darkest hour...so it would make sense that the U.S. would not be present.  I'm sure there are people out there who would dissagree with me, and that's OK.  But last night this vision hit me, almost floored me.  Perhaps it will happen, perhaps not.  But let us wait and be vigilent, and watch as Christ has commanded us nevertheless.  If you will thoroughly study Biblical Prophecy and compare it with current events, you'll be surprised at how fast this earthly train is heading towards its end.  *  This  webpage actually gives a very good Biblical account about the Rapture of the Church.  Again, I want to emphasize that it's not so much  when  the Rapture occurs, but exaclty what we need to be looking out for in terms of Christ's Second Coming: The Abomination of Desolation when the antichrist declares himself God.
