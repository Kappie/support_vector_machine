(he was with some adam kid from swimming) and seb. i'm sure we saw other people we knew but i forget them. elf was stupid, but funny. after heather came to my house and then i got stuff and went to her's to sleep over. at her house i called ben (h.) cause i haven't talked to him in a while. he was burnt out, but i miss him. i'll see him on monday anyways. so, today i was supposed to go to the mall with kara lee and maddie but maddie is in toronto and kara lee deosn't feel like it. besides, i went to the mall yesterday. i am going grocery shopping with my grandma now. i might update later if anything happens. love all who reads, bekah.
