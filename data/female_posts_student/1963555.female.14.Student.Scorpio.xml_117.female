So today at school, S.A.D.D. did this mock-car crash and it really was sad. A bunch of Seniors in the program faked their death, in front of all of us. I almost started crying. and this reporter from ch 3 news came, and talked to us, (not to kill the moment but he was really hot for an older guy)he mentioned how his mother was a recovering alchoholic, and him just talking about his life growing up around that, made me think of mine. It sucks. He also said "In high school I was a goof-off, I didn't need alchohol to make me act like an idiot" I kinda liked that, that's like me. I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to mess around with beer, cigarettes, or any of that shit. Dacia recently tried pot, and I'm not going to follow her down that road. I want somthing more than this town, no matter how cliche that sounds. My W. C teacher was talking about how she didn't fall to that peer-pressure shit, and that she wanted somthing out of life and that helped me decide, I am going to be better than my parents, and everyone else. I felt bad because she started crying she got very upset about this, because it brought back memories of past students killed because of drunk driving. I did all I could not to cry, it's so sad. But I think that demonstration really changed me, I looked around the bleachers, and hardly anyone was paying attention, people were laughing and making jokes. This was ment to open our eyes, and show us how much pain comes out of all this. The reporter, said this quote also... "A real man doesn't conform" I'm gonna follow that, exept change it to a girl. It's kinda funny because the whole rebeling thing was to drink alchohol, and now it's to not drink it. At least for me.
