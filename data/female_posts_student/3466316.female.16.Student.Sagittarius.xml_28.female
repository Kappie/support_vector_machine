AND while tubing, stizphiz and i were thrown into a festering pit of seaweed (well, lake..weed ha), we have yale to thank for that...but it's all good, it was fun...until i felt like i was drowning in medusa's snake-pit hair haha...  alright well this is completely off topic, but how much do you love it when you hear a song for the first time and it feels like one of those songs that you've just been listening to for forever. and it never gets old cuz it's just like those songs your mom played it for you when you were like 4, and everything about the song fits and the melody is just perfect and the lyrics relate to you so much it's almost scary? yeah. i LOVE THAT...it's happened a lot lately and it's just the best feeling. i love music.  i'm sorry but i just don't understand how some people can not listen to music and be normal! music is possibly the best release i can think of, well unless your angry...in which case, smashing rocks (and by smash i mean full on boulder thrown as hard as possible onto another hard surface, preferably a rock) is definitely the best way to go...listening to music and smashing rocks, totally healthy ways of dealing with excess emotion.  wow guys, that was an odd entry. sorry, i just reread it and it makes about zero sense...but it took a whole 5 minutes to write and i am therefore unwilling to delete it. :)
