A car is coming down the road. I wimper and turn my head dreading the thumping noise of the baby being ran over. It comes, Scott tries to comfort me. Thump thump thump. The baby is almost as flat as a pancake and is cut up and bloody. I cry there standing by the road watching the baby lie there crying and there's nothing I can do.
