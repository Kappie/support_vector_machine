I was inspired to right my own blog because of all the good things i've heard about it, I just really needed to express myself constructively without yelling into a pillow to release my anger and frustration. You would think I was a well adjusted teenager, I have everything I could possibly ask for: my own room, computer, cell phone and I go to a private school to top it off, so what could I possibly be angry and frustrated about? Well I am actually very stressed out most of the time. I have a lot to live up to, my brother graduated from Stanford, my sister went to Harvard and now I feel like I should be able to accomplish at least a high score on the SATs. I am frustrated by the stupidity of our government and what dress I should wear to prom. I'm 16 and unable to vote so why should I be worried about who's going to win in the upcoming election. To tell you the truth I don't blame people for not thinking the youth cares about any of the issuses becasue the majority of them don't vote. I like to make it well known that I am very opinionated and really do care about what will happen to my world once I and a member of the larger socirty. I may be young but I am just as concerned about the issues as the next person.
