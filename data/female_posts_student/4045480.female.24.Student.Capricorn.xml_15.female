Around 10:30 I checked my phone and noticed a message from my friend Amanda, that another one of our friends, Leslie, was in the hospital. To back the story up Leslie has cancer, and is on I believe her fourth set of chemos in her lifetime. Well these are so strong she has been knocked for a loop. 103degree fever, isolation room, antibiotics for the next five days in the hospital. That's all of what I know right now. Again, not cool, and my prayers go out to her and her family. It just makes you think of how stupid and petty the bs of life is, how fortunate some of us are to only be dealing with the petty in our lives, and that we should be thankful for what we do have and not gripe and complain about our lack of things. You only go around once, so you better make it a life well spent.  Needless to say, the party was dampened for me, and I left after about an hour more. It just wasn't fun anymore. The drunks were also starting to get political, never fun, but when you're dealing with so many college students and grad students that's the kind of drunks you end up with after a while. Drunk intellectuals. Not the same party you had in high school or in the early college years.
