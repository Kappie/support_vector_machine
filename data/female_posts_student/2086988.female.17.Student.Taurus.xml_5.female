Right after I sent the email, I literally thought I was going to throw up, so I just left class and went to Kiera's class and got her out of there, she saw me and was like why are you shaking so much, so I just sat in the middle of the hallway and told her what I did. I was gone for about 15 minutes, I didn't care what the sub thought why I was gone for so long, like it was any of his business. Omg, did I do the right thing?   So I should keep this to myself And never let you know
