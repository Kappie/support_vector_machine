No one out there makes osobucco sprite sheets unless they have absolutely no life.  i wish someone would take this comic making job from me but...*sigh*  it seems that i'm the only one who is able to use sprite sheets and upload images from my comp onto the computer.  i was the one who taught you all about HTML and URL!  I WAS THE ONE WHO TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO USE A COMPUTER AND HOW TO POST PLAYERS AND PHOTOS!  my next goal is to learn how to put up video clips...
