Saving Grace is coming along painfully slow! So many ideas, I could explode! I have a bunch of story ideas also on the table about a homisidal chain-smoker who kills his girlfriend, one of John Lennon's lovers (Fiction of course), Benjamin Adams (Also fiction... I'm getting a feeling that I've got a pattern here...), a warrior prince, and a prisoner of war. Yeah. A lot.  Please read the newst chapter and enjoy it. A lot of blood and sweat went into that sucker. Be patient, and you'll have the next four chapters!  Thankx  Ambsy
