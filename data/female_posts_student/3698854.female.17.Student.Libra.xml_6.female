Its all fine but I wish sometimes I don’t have to be the one who always apologises. I know that sounds selfish but I apologise because I am sorry where as I think she simply replies because she doesn’t want to put up with me asking why she is angry and wont forgive me. I am lucky to have her friendship but there are these stupid conflicts that keep coming up and I just wish…. Oh I don’t know! I love her more than life itself but….   Trials are in four days. I am going to fail miserably! In maths today we had a ‘revision’ lesson and everyone was like “alpha plus beta equals a over b” and I had no clue what was going on so set my mind free for a few minutes and settled on a particular image. A young girl (teenaged) walks carefully along the top of a grey cliff. She continues on for a while with her careful and precise steps and then reaches the point. She turns to face the wind and the light gale fans her hair out behind her like a cloak of gold and her pale blue gown is subjected to the caprice of the breeze. She holds her arms out before her as though embracing the element as she stands on the edge of the cliff face. Her wide blue eyes hold back the unshed tears of a life of pain and heartache. Her expression is one of a deep sorrow, the kind that steals into ones heart and settles there for eternity and her eyes flutter to a close. She stands as though she were a child of stone except for her flowing dress and hair. Her eyes open slowly and there is a small sigh before she lets herself falls over the cliff as though to soar with the wind just one final time…  This image plagued me all day and I believe it is a symbol of my own self, my own soul, wanting to be set free but I cannot. As the day progressed more and more details emerged from the image and built up so much I could almost sob with her pain. “Hold on. Don’t be scared… Cause all of the star are fading away, try not to worry, you’ll see them someday…”   ~Aine
