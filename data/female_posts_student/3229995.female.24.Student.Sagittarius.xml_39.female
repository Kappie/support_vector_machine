The annoucement of the affair with Rebecca Loos was thought to be the beginning of the end for both their career and their marriage. Why wasn't it??  Victoria seems to have come off the worst of all this. Portrayed as the selfish wife who wants to work on a solo career which so far has not been a huge international success. Much of the media (particularly in the UK) blamed her for the affair. Rebecca Loos even admited in her interview with BSkyB that she would never have had an affair if there wasn't room in David's bed. Many agreed that such a strong family man, when missing his family so greatly would try to recreate that feeling with another. even down to such details as Rebecca using Victoria's bathroom products. Despite what the media presumed would be the end she stood by him, and for the first time was seen smiling.  David, at the same time, has been portrayed both as the betraying husband and the man deserted by his own wife. Its hard to know if he actually did cheat on his wife with Rebecca Loos because there are so many conflicting tales in teh tabloids, one thing is certain his image as a beloved family man has not been tarnished the way it was originally thought to be.  The marriage seems to have survived and so has the brand. What more could they want?  NB: picture included in this post was taken after the news of the affair broke oout - they look pretty happy to me.
