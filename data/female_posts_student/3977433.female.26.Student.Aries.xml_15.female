At time when you're shadowed by trouble and care   like a storm cloud that won't go away,        Remember - one sunbeam can banish the dark   with a single dependable ray.        When you must be patent in loss or defeat   or the sorrow that life sometimes brings,        Remember - in time, from a plain cocoon   comes the beauty of butterfly wings.           You have shown many times before,    how beautiful you are on the inside        And that's how I know your heart   will find its wings again soon."      Thank you Melissa.
