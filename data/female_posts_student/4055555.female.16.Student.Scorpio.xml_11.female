But then I mananged to drag myself out of bed and to tidy my room.. shock horror! That normally doesn't happen you see. Took me quite a bit of time but it looks nice and clean now. I even hoovered up. My job tomorrow is to polish and clean my bathroom :( anyone want to help? Then i de-smelled myself in the shower and pottered around for a while.    A little while later john called round with his kite that Jay's cousin gave us. We walked to Eccleston field even though it was looking dull and raining outside! Being brave and all (hmmm) we still had a go at flying the kite. I have to say it stayed on the ground most of the time, as there mysteriously was no wind... or we were just bad kiteflyers! You can decide lol.    Then John thought he'd spend Â£5 on sweets so that was that and we pigged out at my house. Yummy! I played on CS for a bit but I didn't do too well... but what's new lol. Then I remembered I had a VERY oldPC that was lying around that I wanted to try out again! So that was that. I shifted it into my room and hooked it all up and to my surprise it ran, although painfully slowly. I thought i might manage to scavenge a few parts from it for the PC I'm going to build (in like a million years time) but no such hope as it's crap! It's as simple as that! John tried to run Linux on it but it wouldn't take it :(    Then that was that, John went home. I played more CS (and whooped John's butt may i add :P) and here I am now!    I wonder what will happen tomorrow!
