In fact, today's students have enjoyed the greatest improvement in college affordability since the GI bill provided benefits for returning World War II veterans.   Bullshit. Well, it's bullshit if you live in California, like I do. How do I know this? Let's call it personal experience. Every single semester since 2002 tuition prices have gone up. And every single semester I get pissed off. Don't even get me started on the cost of summer school classes. Naturally, they are more expensive then the usual semester cost, but they have almost doubled in two years. That's right, doubled! To give you an idea at the insane cost of attending summer school, at a California State University, I will be so kind and share with you what I paid. Hold on to your seats. It was $583.00. For ONE class! Give or take a few bucks. And that's not including the cost of books or a parking pass my dear friends.   Disgusting, isn't it?
