At first, I was a little put off...I mean at the end of the day isn't a blog a self-indulgent version of a diary. Why should I assume that my friends and family (and the rest of the internet world for that matter) want to know the secrets of my heart. However, after a great deal of deliberation, I decided that this might be a really good way to keep in touch with people who are far away and to do some venting.   So here I am, my very first blog post. I'd like to tell you all that I have something interesting to say but I don't.  I guarantee you that on Monday (Federal Election day) I will. So until then, I'm going to try to figure out how this infernal thing works.   And that's the way it was today.  Zita
