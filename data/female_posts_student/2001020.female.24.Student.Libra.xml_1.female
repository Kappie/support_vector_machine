I don't understand what I did to deserve to be treated like I'm an unwanted disease or something. I wanted to get back with him long before I knew he was going on a date with someone else. I should've told him. I know I broke up with him for good reasons, but now I just want to take it back. I guess that's my own fault. You never know what you've got till it's gone. Now I'm stuck with getting the shaft because he's got someone to take my place. I don't know what to think of this. I think I'm making myself sick crying over this. Or maybe it's the weather change, but I don't know about that. Well, I can only blame myself. Maybe he's avoiding me because he knows it's best this way and that we shouldn't see each other because it will just hurt...maybe he's got the best interest in mind. But I can only feel what I feel and that's what I want to act on.
