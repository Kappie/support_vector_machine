I was really worried about having my period in a foreign country. With Seasonale you only have 4 periods a year. WOW!! I am so at peace about this.   This weekend is  urlLink Lucky's Fest , the first ever. Carl is pretty nervous, since this is the first big schindig he has put on for his bar. Please feel free to come down and listen to some bands  urlLink Cherry Pie , and  urlLink Bob Rocks . My favorite beer is hosting BUD, Yeah!! There is a huge beer tent, and of course Carl's bar Lucky's will be hosting food. It should be fun! Hope to see some people I like to drink with there.
