Heh, what were you expecting? I am bored out of my socks, and tired, I was up all last night and people kept calling me all morning 'til my dad got a call at about nine and I figured, there's no more sleep for me, so BLAM, I got up. Five hours is what I normally get anyway.  But more bored...my lack of energy probably contributes to it.  So ya, how's it going Lindsey? Still fighting the good fight I hope. Be expecting a call in fifth period or so tomorrow, slight chance I  might  not, my phone's battery is realllllllllly on the blink.  I hope you've consumed about 3593462457561053249132065137 cans of chicken soup by this point, that's what I do in about an hour. Chicken soup is AWESOME when you're sick.  Unless you don't have any guts intake this meager 3593462457561053249132065127 cans, which I must sorrily attest that I didn't.  God, mono sucks.  Patience and recovery be with ye.
