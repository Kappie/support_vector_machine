I want to talk about what happens when you get home after a hard day and find that you father has left a message on your machine, telling you that he read your website and that he thinks that using the "f-word" to make a point is very inappropriate. If it were any other person, I would launch into a lecture about my right to free speech, free assembly, and the academic concept of language reclamation. However, when it is with my father, confrontation seems more difficult, because I was daddy's little girl long before I was a feminist.  When you plant your feet, heart, mind, and soul under the banner of feminism, loving men reaches a level of frustration that is unparallel to any other experience. There are a great number of men who continue to identify feminism as an anti-male campaign. This is a lie. The complexity with feminism and my relationship with my father is that it is difficult to play out simultaneous roles. I can no longer play the role of dutiful daughter, because the woman inside me is demanding justice. I can no longer pretend that my father is a paragon of perfection, because humans are flawed. For any woman who once thought that her father walked on water, it is a hard lesson to learn when you discover that you are a disappointment to the man who gave you life.  I am sorry that I disappointed you, Dad. I am sorry that you think there is hypocrisy in my lifestyle because I use vulgar language and then call myself a Christian, but I will not censor myself for anyone, especially not for you. You were the person who taught me to be strong, to never settle, to always be true to myself, and to believe that I could do anything that I put my mind to. Now, you are telling me that the way that I conduct myself is inappropriate and even though you do not verbalize it, the insinuation in your message is this;  the man who I adore most in the world is ashamed of me.   That is a bitter pill to swallow, even for the most ardent feminist. I still remember what it felt like to be the pride and joy in your life and thought it sounds selfish -even to my own ears- it hurts to even consider the possibility that those feelings are no longer present in your heart when you think of me.
