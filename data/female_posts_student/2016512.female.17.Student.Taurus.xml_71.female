I won state piano as you've probably already read, but i'm just adding it to my archived moments. I'm not going to the concert thing because I don't want to deal with all the wild practices. I'm glad that an alternate will get to go. I've been an alternate on numerous occasions and I was bummed, but now someone gets to go!   I also have prom shoes. Go my mom! Also, I guess Darian is kind of ashamed that he can't drive me to prom since he doesn't have his license. *how cute* so he and his buddies are shootin' for a limo. It should be quite an operation, but fun if it works out.  My webpage is done. I think I'm going to post it on the internet. Ms. Elm seemed pretty impressed with it. I've been working on that dang thing for so long. It feels good to be done with it. Umm I also have my stupid red clay lady fired and my abstract pot is ready to be fired. woot! boo those who think my pot is wierd. At least I have imagination and don't judge people by what they wear!!! grr.   With a seemingly happy disposition, -Betso
