I'm definitely having make-out withdrawal and what's worse is I'm leaving for ten days, so there's ten MORE days. ARGH. NLovewithNSync06: haha im such a nymphomaniac NLovewithNSync06: ur* NLovewithNSync06: DAMNIT!  Katie makes me laugh. She's a funny funny kid. But yeah, today was ok I guess. Really, the only fun thing I did was go out to lunch. I think I did well on my test on Gatsby though so...that's nice.   It doesn't seem like I'm leaving tomorrow. I mean, I am going to school for the first half of the day, so it'll especially just seem like a regular day. I don't think until I'm on the plane and stuff that it will really hit me. I'm going to miss my friends more than I was thinking actually. It's going to be weird not to talk to them but I guess it's ok. Thr only real problem is what I said above. No...no, not really....except...yeah. I think Katie's right...wellll, she would have been had she typed it correctly the first time :-P  Haha, and I bet none of that made sense. But it's ok because I'm not really sure I want it to make sense to anyone....  OK, I really need to go finish laundry/packing.
