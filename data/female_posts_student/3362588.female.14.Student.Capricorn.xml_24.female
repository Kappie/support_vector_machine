The livingroom is no longer my sancuary I can hide out in.  Kevin and Eric and Clarisa sit on the couch all day long and I can't do anything on the computer without them reading it or look like they're reading it.  I'm trying to work on my novel and this other writing excercise thing, but I don't want to write when they're looking.  So I'm taking advantige of the fact that it is early and no one is up yet.  I made a really really really yummy smoothie (peaches, and rasberry yogurt, and sugar, and orange juice, and icecubes, yummy!!!)    Aww, darn,  Everyone's getting up now...    Anyway.  I had a somewhat good day yesterday, and a somewhat bad day.  The good part was that I got a guitar (classical, Jeff gave it to me).  So I'm totally excited about that.  I just need to get some stuff to play it and I'm all set.  And I got a goldfish named Famous.  It is our new band mascot.  tee hee.  I'm supposed to give it to Amy, but I think I'll just keep it and buy her a new one.  :D.  I think Famous is gonna die anyway... boohoo.  AND (yeah, it was a good die, sorta), I won a really awesome fishy tie!!!!  See, me and ashley had to answer this question from Mark, and who ever guessed the answer won.  I guessed it in like 5 minutes flat, so I got the tie.  Here's the question:  There is a number that when  you multiply the number by any other number and then add all the digits in the product together, the resulting number is either the original number or a product of it (I think that's how it goes....)      But the bad news was that I was totally stressed and ticked all day.  The twins totally got on my nerves, I didn't have a single minute all day when I was alone (a big issue for me), and I was depressed just becuase, and I was totally stressing over going to public school this year.  I'm really scared.  Be careful what you pray for, you just might get it.  :D  Yeah..... So I'm totally scared.  You might think, waz da big deal?  But for me, it is a big deal.  I have never been in any sort of school in my entire life, people!!!!  And I don't know alot of the people... and....... and..... and.....  So I'm freaked.  Totally new world out there.      G2G.  Work time.......  gotta blow dry my hair.  TTYL  ~Jak the stressed out
