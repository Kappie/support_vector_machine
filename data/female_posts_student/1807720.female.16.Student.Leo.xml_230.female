I went to Bragg Creek for the first part of the day - ate a really awesome lunch and have some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. That was so good, and like that is the like 2nd week of eating ice cream every single day. I haven't gained a pound. I have been like hungry all the time. I practically eat like six meals a day. That is pretty sick when you think about that. Six meals a day!! When I got back I felt really stuffed from that ice cream I ate so I went to the gym. I had not been in a while so I thought it was best to go. I am in pretty good shape still, but usually I can run 30 mins straight on the treadmill no prob, but I was kind of hurting yesterday and couldn't do as much. That was only cause I haven't been keeping up with it more often than usual.  So then I like ate again when I got home from working out. I went to Wendy's to pick up Chels from work, then stopped at her house, and went to....THE PARK!! Yeah ok, it was only to talk. We just talked about what we wanted to do the rest of the night. I was like "lets go buy a game we don't have or something." So believe it or not everyone took to my idea. So I drove to Walmart and we checked out the prices, but it was all too expensive. We wanted hungry, hungry hippos but it was over $20. So then we went to walmart and checked out the prices there. Hungry, hungry hippos was more expensive, but then we found some like no name brand game. 'The Frog Game' or well Hungry Hungry Frogs!! Before we played though we were all starving by 8:00 PM so we went to Moxies for like the second week in a row. We all ordered chicken fingers and fries cause Mike was working and he is responsible for cooking deep fried crap like that. Anyway you know how they like never give you enough of the sauce stuff I asked the lady "Do you think I can have extra plum sauce with my meal" and of course she says "No Problem." A couple minutes later our meal shows up and guess what she brings. She brought a plate of FOUR extra plum sauce, but Andy and Chels didn't want theirs so they gave me theirs to eat too. If anyone knows me, I HATE wasting food and would rather eat it then leave it knowing that there our people in this world who don't have as much as we do. Anyways:   RULE 1: Don't ask for extra plum sauce RULE 2: If you are a retard and do ask for extra, be SPECIFIC RULE 3: If they bring you too much plum sauce, don't eat it ALL    So anyways I slowly worked my way through eat little container thing. One by one. So much friggin plum sauce. Too much. Where was my Dad when I needed him. I mean I sure could have used some help eating that. I am guessing I probably ate like half of the bottle. By the end of my meal I had ate four of those container things of plum sauce and one container thing of ketchup. I thought Chels was going to get sick just watching. I had a stomach ache after that. When I was driving everyone back to my place, we put on that song by Ace of Base - Cruel Summer. We sang along with it but in the words: It's a cruel, cruel, cruel summer, we sang to: It's a cruel, cruel, cruel Dinner! That was so hilarious. When we got to my place my mom thought we were all drunk. She was like "What did you drink tonight?" We went to my room and played hungry, hungry frogs for like hours. That was SOOOOOOOO much fun. I mean I have NEVER had that much fun playing any game before. It's like my new favorite - Hungry, Hungry Frogs. Best game ever I swear!! I encourage all of you to go out to Zellers and buy it! It's half the price of hungry hippos and twice the fun!
