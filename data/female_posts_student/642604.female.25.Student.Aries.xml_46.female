[ Tue May 20, 01:56:54 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So anyway, I just saw Bend It Like Beckham this weekend and I absolutely loved it! Everyone should go see this movie. It's a fun movie about this indian girl living in England who wants to play on this girls soccer team. Her parents, being completely rooted in Indian culture, forbid it despite her efforts and despite her talent. She plays anyway, lying to her parents at every turn. She falls for the coach who is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he is great in this character. I've seen him in both Velvet Godmine (EWAN!!!!!!) and The Magnificent (sp?) Ambersons. He's a great actor but I loved him most in this! Anyway, just go see the movie!   Erin
