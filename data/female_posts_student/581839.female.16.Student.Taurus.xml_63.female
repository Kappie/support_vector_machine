I mean, hello? what ever happened to family? why doesn't she write about us? Anyway, thats not the point. The point is that i want to go and eat at joes pizza, and it is so funny, because it's my life story. You see, Joe's used to serve really good pizza. but I don't like the pizza there, so i always have the spaghetti, which is pretty good. well, like almost all restaurants do, they started doing well, and cheapining their products and making th crust soggy. the thing is, they started changing the spaghetti, and i think that it's better.  well, because everybody else eats the pizza, they decided not to go anymore. now isn't that ironic? it so is. Anyway, i gots ta go. i have to write a speech on the Andrea Yates thing. bye bye! JULES
