Cary McNamara screwed with the votes somehow so they're re-doing the whole election by paper ballots! I didn't hear exactly what he did, but it was something serious, Keidel came on and talked about it, and then Cary came on and made a school-wide apology. And this morning, all the Student Body Leader People (Robbie, Cary) were walking around going, "Dude, something big is up, they won't even tell us what's happening." They called all the candidates back in this morning, and by the time I got back, they straightened it all out. So hey, here comes another shot at it. And this time I'll tamper with the polls.  I'll have a piece of strep with a slice of bronchitis and some inflamed lymph nodes on the side. Get better, sick people (numbering two as of now)!!
