Not to mention I'm typing a faster then I thought was humanly possible. I feel all twitchy and sort of... fuzzy for lack of a better word. Like I'm not feeling properly or something. Caffeine can be amazingly fun for something so simple. Sure, most people just get twitchy and have to pee a lot, but there are those of us for which it does oh so much more. I only know Helen because Megan, Steph and I convinced her to take a whole buttload of caffeine pills at a retreat one night. She kept thinking the garbage cans were moving. Then she fell down the the stairs and we had to drag her outside. That is how really great friendships are made...  I'm starting to worry about hot neighbor-dude. I haven't spoken to him much since a week ago but I've had some really odd run-ins with him in the last few days. He's become really good friends with my dad, helping him rebuild motorcycles and the like. I know all of my dad's good friends pretty well because there always around. They smile, wave, make polite small talk etc. They're all perfectly nice to me. T is a bit different though. For one thing he's the only one of them under 40. Isn't it a bit weird for a 20 something to hang out with guys in there 40's to 60's? Bah, that's not the point. Anyway, in the past few days he's been around constantly. Yesterday I was taking some pictures of some of their bikes for them. I was standing in T's driveway to do this because everyone parked down there. My dad was standing behind me pointing out specific things he needed close-ups of for his website. My dad's friend Matt came out of T's garage, smiled and said hi like any normal person would and started talking to my dad. So I went back to photographing things. Several minutes later I turned around to see T standing a few feet behind me and just staring at me. I have no idea how long he was standing there. He didn't say anything so I smiled at him. He just looked really flustered for a few seconds, flashed me a bit of a smile and walked really quickly back into his house. What the hell was that all about?  So today when I went home he was standing in my backyard talking to my dad. I got out of my car, grabbed my bookbag and turned around to look into the yard. Yup, staring again. Lovely. So I smiled and waved in a neighborly sort of way. For a few seconds he looked around all confused and then slowly smiled and waved back. Good lord that man's weird. I mean, we know each other, we live right bloody next to each other. If he hated me he would at least still be polite? Hell, that lady down the street that thinks I run a meth lab waves at me, albeit a bit reluctantly. Somebody help me with this one, what's his issue?  I was looking at the back of Helen's notebook this morning. In VERY large letters it says: Angela is my Ho. She's tall, skinny, and easily breakable!" Could something like that be considered sexual harassment? That girls even stranger than I am...
