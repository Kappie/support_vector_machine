Just thought I would cut in and like...say "what's up?"...so, what's up? Don't say the sky or I'll kick your ass. I'm serious. Wachu think, I'm not gonna come over there right now and kick your ass? Whadoyou think, huh? Whadoyou think? Punk! A-hole! Heh. No I'm just kidding, you're awesome, I love you. I don't know who you are but I love you anyway. That could be homosexual. Bet Will's listening to this right now and just thinking, like, "Oh my God, I have a gay guy's CD,"...it's true. I'm gay. I'm GAY. 'K not really. But that is a very funny idea cuz...uh, yeah, whatever. I must say kids, it's...12 o clock in the morning. I'm sitting here making random tracks for the CD just cuz I wanna fill a-lots of space, and um...so far...d'I dunno. You probably heard...LET ME GO...and you probably heard SO LOW...they rhyme! And other stuff, there's gonna be a lot of stuff on here, mostly ideas I've had that didn't quite make the cut, for instance, the song called DOWN...I don't even know the lyrics, I can't hear 'em anyway so I cut 'em out. It's just a guitar piece and some bass and other stuff but...um...um...I...I hope you guys are 'joyin' the CD, I know I am! I like making CDs, I dunno why the hell I'm doing this but I like it anyway. So...enjoy. I know I'll be back at the end. Have fun kids.
