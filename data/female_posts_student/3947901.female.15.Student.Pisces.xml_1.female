The bunny is filled in with white crystals and then the eye is a blue crystal. I love it. And thanks to my friend, KT, I also got a black playboy bunny armband from Hot Topic. They gave her a 5 finger discount. ;) I'm like totally obsessed with the playboy bunny now. I want to get a pink poster that has the playboy bunny on it and it says Playmate. But I am not a slut! Nor am I a future playmate. Though it would be nice. I'd love to live with Hugh Heffner. He's kind of cute for an old man.
