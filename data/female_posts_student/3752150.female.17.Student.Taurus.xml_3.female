I leave with BethAnne tomorrow at like 2 or 3. I know you're all gonna miss me dreadfully but don't worry, I'll only be gone for a week. Most of the people that read my blog are going to camp anyways, but probably not until sunday or monday. It's gonna be SUPER fun. I love road trips. Imagine me and BethAnne in a car together for about 4 hours.... scary I know. Well everyone, feel free to leave me tons of comments while I'm gone. EEEEEE.... I'm so excited.
