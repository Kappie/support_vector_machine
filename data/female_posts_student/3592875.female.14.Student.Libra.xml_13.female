I read a book called "greiving the death of a pet"(everyone who has lost a pet and are still greiving should read this) and i found a few things in there that i thought we're pretty helpful for me when i lost my best friend in the whole wide world (Tibby, my dog, my baby). so i put some different things together and came up with this...    I'm going to start off with one of the most important verses in the Bible, Eccles 3:18   There’s a right time for everything: A time to be born, a time to die; A time to plant; A time to harvest; A time to kill; A time to heal; A time to destroy; A time to rebuild; A time to cry; A time to laugh; A time to grieve; A time to dance; A time for scattering stones; A time for gathering stones; A time to hug; A time not to hug; A time to find; A time to lose; A time for keeping; A time for throwing away; A time to tear; A time to repair; A time to be quiet; A time to speak up; A time for loving; A time for hating; A time for WAR; A time for PEACE.                              …A Time to Love…                            (Eccles. 3:8)   Don’t tell me “she’s just a dog’, she was my best friend, my family, my baby. Don’t ask me “if I’ve gotten over it yet”; I’ll never get over it.  “Enough, please, I’m ready to go. You’ve done all you can possibly do, And it’s okay to let me go now. You’ve always had my well-being foremost in you mind, And I’ve known that. You’ve always tended to my safety, and I’ve known that. I thank you for all that you have done— You’ve sacrificed sleep and rest—for me. You’ve sacrificed your personal life—for me. You’ve sacrificed your financial comfort—for me. How could I ever doubt you love for me? I couldn’t, and I don’t. I never have before, and I don’t now. And, now, I thank you for what you are about to do. You are going to let me go lovingly and unselfishly— Neither of us is the same as we were  Before we adopted each other. We’ve become part of the tapestry of each other’s life. Now wrap me lovingly in your love and hold me gently. I will be part of your life’s tapestry forever.”  --------                         A Time too Grieve                  “a time to weep…and time to mourn”                          (Essles.3:4)   A fell apart. Even now I think about this, and I can’t believe I’m still alive. I can’t believe I didn’t die of a broken heart. I would not ever want to feel like this again.    ---------                           A Time to Let Go                         “A time to die”                         (Eccles. 3:2)  A knew life was changing and that things would never be the same.  I also knew in my heart it was exactly what I needed to do, the best thing for her.  It was really important to me that I could be there with her to say goodbye and be with her until the end.  To say, “See?” I kept my word. I promised you I would never leave you.”    ------------    ..And this part is the most important to me, it made me relize that everything will be ok in the end and she will always be with me                          A Time to Heal              “a time to heal…and time for peace”                       Eccles. 3:3, 8  Out of all this pain, I got more insight, and I became a stronger person. After Tibby died, when I realized what kind of experience I had, I felt more whole as a person.     “Why are you crying?”  “Well, because you’re gone.”  “I’m right here with you. I’m all around you. I’m with you always.              “I know, but you’re not physically here. I can’t see you. I can’t hold you.”  “Is that really it? You have Cooper. You do have a dog you can be with, that you can touch.”   “I can’t hold Cooper; He doesn’t like to be held, but I can physically  Contact with him.”  This conversation made me really think about what was really going on.  “Well you know? I said, “Your right, it isn’t really that.” Then I thought what is it really about? Why am I crying?  “It’s just that I never wanted to see you suffer and die the way you did.”  “I know my love, but it’s all over now.  I’m not suffering anymore.  Its not part of my reality existence anymore.  If you want to come cry on my shoulder for awhile, you can, but you don’t have to weep anymore.  Let all your summer things comfort you. I’m all around you, I’m out in all the summer things that you love so much.”
