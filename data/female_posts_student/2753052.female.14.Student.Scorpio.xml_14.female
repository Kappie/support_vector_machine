Granted, it doesn't really, y'know, affect me, but it's still bad news.  In other news, I have $40 in my wallet just BEGGING to be spent...but at least half is going to be going towards new speakers. Woe is me. I need some new reading material, badly. I've read White Oleander (amazing book might I add) at least three times now. Gah, I need a life.
