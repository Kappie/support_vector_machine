You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like Diamonds in the Rough.    urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Most often, I draw the outline of the person first, the skeleton of their profile that are the basic strokes for their unique look. And then I paint the muscles and tissue around the plain bones, weaving the sinewy fibers together in ways that bring about the creation of flesh and beauty. And then I add the accessories, the eyes, the hair, the clothing. The exterior is always fun to draw, always fun to add a piece of me to them, but it's the story behind the eyes that really matters. It is the creation of a life, a personality that breathes excitement into the art.  My mind is empty at the moment. Like a hollow glass balloon. Last night, Saturday night...what a night. A rendevous meeting that left me in smiles. I thought that the trip to Jessie's was going to be a simple in and out mission, get the sweater, get home. But what I had not expected was to put my four wheeler into reverse and then see something black come racing around the corner of the house, something black and familiar. The moment I got off my seat, you had me in your arms and I melted into your embrace as much as I could. You told me that you missed me and I couldn't have been happier when you kissed me. But it was too short, I needed more, I wanted more. But I couldn't..Before I knew it, you were gone and the lonely stretch of pavement leading me back to the dungeons of the country house I call home was all that wrapped around me. And all at once, things I wanted to say to you come pouring into my head and I cursed myself for not saying them. I don't have very much time with you until the ocean of time seperates us, before the mist settles and I'm left waiting beside the mirror. I'm such a fool for clamming up and now, if I could go back, I would have kissed you and told you how much I loved you. Until then, I'll float on and hopefully survive my bouts of insanity.
