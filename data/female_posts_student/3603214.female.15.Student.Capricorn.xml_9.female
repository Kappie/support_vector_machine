Cup fights are FUN especially when there's only like 4 ppl there at the time. We then played outburst and watched Secret Window. That's when ppl started showin up. Kyle n I had a poking match...I swear I won lol. N then I played air hockey. It's a tradition, what can I say? n I ended up talkin bout my father, the bastard n kate the bitch. so yea, interesting. i almost died too...i choked on a pepperoni n they turned off the lights n the basement while they were playin video games n i was like chokin out i need sumthin to drink! n then i started flailing my arms n kyle was like omg here! n i couldn't open the can n then he's like omg! thats the last orange, so weebles tried to give me pepsi but the orange came thru even tho weebles held the pepsi like an inch by my face. so i thanked kyle for savin my life even tho he's convinced that was part of my secret plot to take the last orange, n i told him he has a small place in my cold heart n he was like i could thaw ur heart n i was like u kno u wanna. O good times. But good times don't last for me...O no...Mom got me 15 minutes early and I was kinda mad that I didn't get to stay longer even tho I'm goin to Chicago tomorrow n hafta get up early. Not that I care. But I realized that I don't care anymore. It doesn't matter to me if I get in trouble, if I just get up and leave. I don't have anything to live for anymore because it's all been robbed from me. My only family are my friends. I'm absolutely depressed and I don't want to live like this. I want to go away and start over. I don't want this family. I don't have a father, and my mom isn't necessarily happy w/ me. So I warned her that I was gonna just start sneakin out n stayin @ other ppl's houses. I don't care if I get caught by cops. I DON'T CARE. Supposedly, I'm all my mom has and she can't go on w/o me, blah, blah blah...it's out of my hands. I wish I could care. I wish I had love. I wish I had happiness. I don't want to be depressed anymore. WHERE'S MY GOOD? There's always bad and it keeps following me like a sick puppy that wants a home. Just...help me escape. Please...
