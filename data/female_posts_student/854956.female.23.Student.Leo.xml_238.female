I need my staff members to help out, but I can not have them paid if they come and help me b/c our non-profit org. can't afford it right now. :-\ Dang it! So, I have pretty much 5/8 of my paperwork to do tomorrow in 1-1/2 hours. I just have to go in there with the frame of mind that I'll finish it. I have to get it done. It's extremely important to have the emergency cards done soon, because we're gonna have to make copies of them to go outside with the groups when they go outside for outdoor play. (sigh) I hope I finish it tomorrow. Thankfully we have a lot of siblings, and since there are 4 cards to a page, then I can just look at the other kid's info and put it down for the other one (or two as the case sometimes is). So... Thursday, 29 July, I turn 23. Probably all I'm doing for that day is going out to eat. My parents were going to take me for seafood. YUM! I think we're just going to go to Red Lobster... I want some shrimp and lobster! :-) Then this weekend I'm doing something with all my friends. Don't really know WHAT yet, but something. Possibly going dancing... really depends on what goes on Saturday and how much we get done (we're helping the guys move to their new townhome in Austin!)... So, yeah... I'll post later, I need a nap.
