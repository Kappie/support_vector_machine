As I am beginning to get used to things either breaking down or falling apart on me....whether it's my car or my friends...or myself!....I just roll my eyes, pull over and immidiatly blame it on myself...surely there was something I could've done to keep this car from overheating....maybe I should've just drove it into the lake...that'd have ooled it off.  But, seeing as there is no lake for over 300 miles, I get on the phone and wait for a ride.  After driving the 30 miles to town, getting the antifreeze and oil my father suggested, we drive 30 miles to my car and realize it's the red antifreeze we need and we'd bought the green.  So...once again..what had I been thinking?!!  Back to town we go...exchange antifreeze, eat a burger, grab the dogs (a joy ride for them)....then drive the 30 miles to my car..AGAIN!  Trying to limp it back to Alpine, it began to RE-overheat, so we called Josh to bring his trailer and haul us in.  Being as it was atleast 110 degrees outside and not knowing how long it'd take Josh, we lifted up the hatchback on the car and counted the many passing cars that were in too big of a hurry to help us..thank God we weren't dying.  Well...the heat WAS getting to us, so I decided to take off my pants and run around in my shirt and underwear doing cartwheels in the road....Robbi and I made up a few of our own Jane Fonda/Richard Simmons moves and... well...not only was the heat beggining to fry our brains, but we were in the middle of no where and no one was stopping to help us anyway!  We actually counted 87 vehicles carrying unthoughtful jerks who wouldn't stop and help!!  Finally, after sitting on the side of HWY 67 for an hour and a half in the blazing sun, Robbi began yelling at me to put my pants on...there's Josh!! We hauled my car in, dropped it off at the mechanics, and then headed to the bar...a nice cold beer was needed for all!!  Needless to say, that was Saturday, and as of today, (thurs)  my car is still at the mechanics waiting to get worked on.  Of course, this is all a result of me living as far away as I can from actual civilization and of me not thinking too clearly....but it makes for a great adventure!!
