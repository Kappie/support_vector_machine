I mean, it's good that he can be open, but I still don't fully understand why he would think that. I was completely fine until last night. We have done alot of things out of *bed*, but knowing a guy they wouldn't remember. We only get to see one another a few days every couple of months, that's not enough time to do everything, both hanging out and other stuff, it was pretty balanced to me. So now, I'm really not wanting to do anything in May, like that, even though I was looking forward to all those things that we do in *bed*, but now it just seems it would be different...
