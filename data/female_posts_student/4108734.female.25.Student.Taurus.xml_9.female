I wonder what my friend Katya is doing today, and what kind of job the LORD has provided for her.  I'm praying for Kharim, the Buddhist monk who isn't convinced that Buddha is the way and still has life in his eyes.  I'm asking the LORD to protect him and preserve his life in a dark and desolate place.  I'm trusting that Misha's church is flourishing, and that God is protecting them from the shaman that lives next door.    Isn't that always the way of it, though?  We long for things of the past - good things, but past things.  God uses it to spur us to pray for the people in that past season, that we may never meet again.  But He also uses it to draw us forward, into the future.  I think - well, if that was good, what amazing things are just around the corner?  What surprises is He planning for me?  Does He want to introduce me to some random person while I'm hanging out with my brother tonight?  Is there something He wants to teach me from seeing Spiderman 2?  (Yes, I occasionally - ok, frequently - fall into the category of nerd!)  Who does He want me to pray for?  What is He trying to speak to my heart?   So I'm thinking about all these things, and I start thinking about old poems I've written.  It's like a small picture of how the LORD has changed my heart and my perspective.  Here's a poem I wrote when I was in high school, called "It"...   I’m so confused.  All I want is  Rest.  Three precious moments of peace.  My mind is burning with all of these  Questions.  Someone please help me.  I’m still here, fumbling in the eternal Night, struggling to survive.  Clouds of confusion envelop me.  I scream  Hysterically, reaching out for a grip on reality.  Am I getting closer, or farther Away?  I seem to be drifting…  Thoughts in my mind scurry around like Cockroaches scrambling for a place to hide.  Yet here I lay.  Motionless. Absolutely still.  My soul is too old.  I feel so Tired.  All I want is peace.  I’m so confused.  If I try hard  Enough, I’ll discover the truth.  The answer is here  Somewhere.  I just have to  Find It.  And here is a poem I wrote just about a year ago, called "divine blood and affection"...   discipline eludes me like a fragrance too stale to remember. purified by obedience.   what does that mean, anyway?  purity. the end.  why must the means be obedience?  one of those daunting words like submission. consistency. perseverance.  rebellion in me must be conquered. impale it upon spears of ruthless trust and nascent purity. emerge triumphant dripping in divine  blood and affection.   I really like the change.  I am incredibly grateful for the change, and that doesn't even begin to convey the meaning in my heart.  The LORD has been so amazingly merciful to me.  He is beginning to reveal to me how closely and tenderly He has held me in the protection of His arms.  Even the scars and brokennes are a protection, in a way.  He has revealed my weakness and need for Him, and it draws me to Him.  Further up and further in, I hear Him calling.
