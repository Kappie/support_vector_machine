Hopefully  nothing crops up at the very last moment. just 2 days back, we were informed that the  Police knowledge  course would last for 3 days, instead of 2. the test was held at  Training command  (Tracom in short, also known as the Police academy) today.  Everything went smoothly.. in the beginning, we had to march a longass distance to the lecture theatre. then we were brought to air-conditioned classrooms =) we combined classes with  queenstown sec  for the test.. they were pretty.. crazy like us. our PCIs were  really  nice. he allowed us to cheer and stuff while the other classes had to shut their mouths up for the entire 3 hours +..  =P After the test we wenta' change into our quarter Us and this group of annoying fucktards (PCIs) totally abused their authority!  i hate them . i know i once said,  it takes a lot of energy to hate someone . however in this case, they are SO worth to be despised and blacklisted. i hope one of them accidentally comes across my site and reads this. yay. i hate you.   Lunch was  okkaaay . i had carrot cake with  ma'am  jess ,  fungi kor , val,  jeff  and the other CIs. then got home while the rest wenta' catch  charlies angels  full throtle. aaah. tired.. ahaa. anyways!  today  is a special day. so i shall take some time to think about things. take care lovers =D *teehee.
