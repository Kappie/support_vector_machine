That's the third time I've heard that phrase today, and third time=the charm... so ...  Really scared. Not only that, but the tryouts tomorrow, probly other junk that I forgot. Honestly I'm going to have to create another personality to keep up with it all.  Farewell, friends.  Oh yes, and the movie was excellent, and I already toldja but there would be a big gaping hole in the BLog had I not answered. !!
