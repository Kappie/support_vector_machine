First, I will need to be working on my prelim paper, which will certainly require help from Carla, and second, I will need to work out how to get to S. Africa (if I can't this year), and what to do about learning fauna, etc, and for that I need John.  Oh dear.  I suppose I'll have to have a long meeting with both of them before I leave for the semester.  Which, by the way, is two months from today.  Yay!
