There was recently a bit of legal difficulty, though, in ensuring that the camp would take place. However, the camp, which takes place next week, was allowed to proceed, although the camp coordinators put into place a rule, saying that the campers (aged 11-17) must bring at least one parent or guardian with them.     True, the judge, Richard L. Williams., allowed the full array of naked camp activities to process, including, according to court papers, swimming, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, body painting, pudding fights, “shaving cream follies” and, alarmingly, darts.    I was surprised that they chose to put something like this in the newspaper. The article was very entertaining, but I wasn’t quite sure what purpose it served. Perhaps it was just in there for a little bit of human interest. It wasn’t  completely  pointless; I enjoyed reading it.   However, it makes me wonder. The article didn’t seem very relevant to anything, besides the fact that the camp “is an hour’s drive southeast from here”, presumably meaning New York. Why would a journalist put something like that in a newspaper for reasons other than human interest (or, for nudists, information on possible summer camps)? Unless the journalist (Adam Liptak) was a nudist himself, I don’t see any major reason why to publish the article. Perhaps Liptak thought it would give insight to some of the activities and lives of a very small minority in America. Does anyone have any other thoughts?
