We'll get there around 5:00 Florida time. (that's 4:00 our time)  We're leaving out of Miami Monday at 5:00pm, but I'll probably be on the boat by noon, since we've been on this line before a couple of times, so we're in the captain's club(which just basically means we get on first and get special treatment...kind of.  It basically means that we get on early and if we go on enough cruises then we get a set of chmpagne glasses.  We already got one because this old man thought my little sister was cute (in a non-perverted way...He was like, 80, and she was about 7) so he struck up a conversation with my mother, and he and my father worked in the same business, so they really got along well.  He had been on something like 25 cruises, just on Celebrity, and so they gave him champagne glasses, and he gave them to my mother.  He was so sweet; he would like kiss mine, my mom's and Whitney's hands when he met us, and would give a little bow when he saw my father.  He was the most gentlemanly man I have ever met in my entire life.  Anyway, I'm going off on a totally different tangent than I meant to.  I'll be back either Friday or Saturday, depending on what we decide to do.  So, um, you guys, get back on the blog, and get ready (I have a feeling) to laugh at loud at my wonderful Spring break.
