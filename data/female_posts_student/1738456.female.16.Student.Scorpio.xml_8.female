I’d had this particular pair of converse since the eighth grade. I refused to give them up, much like the pair of jeans that I was now wearing as shorts. I pulled those off to and dove into the pool. I looked back and checked to see where Jack was. It looked like he had retreated into his smoky land of escape, and I was glad. Sometimes he made me nervous.  I swam back and forth letting time and all my worries flow away from me like the water at my sides. Slowly I began to feel much better, and soon I thought I was ready to tackle my English assignment.  I climbed out of the pool and began to towel off. Suddenly, a small black cat was at my feet. It didn’t look like either of mine, so I bent down to see if there was a collar.  “Poor kitty, kitty, don’t you have a home?” I asked it, relying on the fact that it wouldn’t respond. It looked up at me, its large green eyes begging, and put its front paws on my knees.   “How cute,” I smiled and scratched the top of its head. “I bet you’re hungry, huh? Do you want something to eat?” Call me crazy, but the cat nodded its head at me. So I stood back up to go get it the pan my cats used for food.  I walked silently to my garage, watching as the shadows morphed aimlessly into frightening shapes. I stopped for a second, and waited for someone to jump out of the shadows and grab me. I stood there, for what seemed like forever, as the music and smoke from the party sifted through into my yard creating a whirlwind of smells and sounds. Slowly my bad feeling slid away, and I enjoyed the little bit of Marley and Sublime I could hear.   I bent down to pick up the bowl. To my surprise, the cat was already there.  “Wow, you’re faster than my kitties,” I scratched the top of its head again and headed back over to the pool. Curious, I wondered at the cats abilities, Is it even real? I asked myself, and then I shook my head to empty it of the booming noise I’d made there.  I started walking to my clothes when I stepped on something hard. The cat hissed at me as I jumped off its tail.  “Oh! I’m sorry,” I bent down to pet him, when another one came from behind me. “There’re two,” I marveled aloud. The one that had just appeared slinked towards me. Just as I reached out to pet it, it slashed me with its claws. I yelped, and jumped back, right into my pool.  I sank to the bottom, watching the bubbles I had created with my breath. I swam back up to the top swiftly. So much for drying myself off. I hoisted myself onto the side and sat down. Both the cats were gone. I breathed a sigh of relief, although I wasn’t quite sure why.
