You have no idea.   Now onto bussiness. This Canada day I wasn't able to see fireworks (thank you for telling me about English Bay! Too bad my computer was dead) But I was able to see Trooper, as well as meet them, at Rocky Point. It was a blast my ears haven't rung that badly since... It's been awhile.   It's really wierd about parents, you think they're one way and then poof they're people. I mean ya I'm one of those queer (not that way) kids who likes hanging out with their parents. I can't help it if I got a good set! Still they suprise me sometimes. My dad's always been into the rock scene, when he was yonger he knew a bunch of the big names, expecially if those names were Vancouver based. He did the parties so on and so forth, and still never got completely ripped on drugs. He used to go hiking and skiing with one of the origional guitarists of Trooper (I can't remember his name). Dad introduced mom and I to his old buddies and it was pretty cool they stopped sighning for a quick second to talk and were kind of amused that he had gotten married with a kid.   This brag moment brought to you by...   Well GO CANADA! YOU ROCK BABY! So on and so forth it's almost dinner time. I'll probably post later tonight after we go to a movie.
