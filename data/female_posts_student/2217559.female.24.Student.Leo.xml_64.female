Last night we had our "Circle of Excellence" awards for the staff and 10 employees were given awards. Shortly thereafter we had a party and all the stars showed up for it. It was fun - nice treat for the crew.  I was hosting them around the party though so I was pretty much working (but, yeah, what a deal though). No worries. Anyway, tonight THE group as they have become to be called, is hosting a private kareoke session and I have been invited! I told Shaft (Richard Roundtree) that I want to sing "I've had the time of my life" with him. Heheheh. I will let you  know the turnout. Hahahah. How funny though right? Me singing a dirty dancing song in front of Patrick Swayze. Hahahahahahahha.  Anyway, I miss my family and friends in Austin like crazy. I started packing some things today and will send a box home of stuff to Mom next week. May 29th will be here sooooo soon!!! Love you all dearly. Hi Paddy.   Shelly.
