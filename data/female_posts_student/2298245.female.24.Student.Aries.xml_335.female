I have been like a yo-yo all day, I know, and I truly hate days like this, but I think that this time, I've seen the light.  First, I had a most wonderful and calming conversation with my good friend Christina, who listened attentively as I expunged the day's difficulties upon her.  She was most supportive, as she always is, and I came away feeling renewed and refreshed, though little bumps along the way threatened my serenity.  Then, a thoughtful and supportive instant message from Simone picked me right back up again.  She and I shared the benefit of good conversation and company this weekend, and now I realize that God was really looking out for me in that department, preparing me for the misery (or so it seems) ahead.  I am grateful for being able to get to know her better over the past few months, and I choose to focus on that rather than the nasty business at hand.  Then came the real kick in the knees that I needed.  I mentioned earlier that I unintentionally inspired my roommate to get out and go to Palm Sunday mass tonight.  She didn't come back immediately afterwards, and I wondered what she was up to.  She just came back in, having been spiritually renewed and inspired by the beginning of the holy week to go and see  The Passion .  It was as profoundly moving an experience for her as it was for me.  But that is not what got me.  Nice as it is that I was able to indirectly benefit someone spiritually, what she said back to me was most beneficial of all.  She told me that she forced herself to watch every bit of Christ's suffering, because if he could go through all that, then the least she could do is watch.   And it all clicked.  What is it that I'm really upset about?  It is a trifiing matter that will be unimportant to me in a matter of days.  Surely if Christ could bear the weight of the torture and the weight of all sin, then I can bear the discomfort of not having a perfect life, of meeting with disappointment and despair.  No, I am not God, and He knows that, and does not expect me to be as strong as His Son.  But surely He can expect me to not go to pieces over a simple and ultimately unimportant matter.  And more surely than that, I can and will deliver.  Though I may stumble along the way, I have ever intention of success.  And so, as Scarlett O'Hara says:  "Tomorrow is another day."  I get to start fresh, and make light of today's irksome difficulties.  And they will be ground to dust.
