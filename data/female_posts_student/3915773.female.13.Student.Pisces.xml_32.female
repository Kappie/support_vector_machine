The cosmetics company has teamed with Atlantic Records to create its own record label, CG Vibes: Music That Gives Back".    Cover Girl, whose previous message was "we are a strong believer in inner and outer beauty", has freshened itself up with it's new "look good, be good" statement. CG Vibes' first CD is a collection of nine songs from prevalent artists such as Queen Latifah, Brandy, and the Corrs. Cover Girl plans to market and sell the CDs from July 20thto the end of December. They plan to use the proceeds"to finance $10,000 grants to five young women in recognition of their community service". One shall go to a young woman who has applied herself in music, two to those "who start programs to fulfill unmet needs", and the other two to "young women who have had an effect on an existing program".  Managing partner at the Prophet Judy Hopelain remarks, "They're probably hoping that the 'cool factor' can rub off on them from the music, and that the passion that young people feel about their causes will rub off on the Cover Girl brand". Of course, the artists featured in the CD will recieve money for their work, but also media publicity.Does the consumer benifit at all from this new advertising angle? Or is it a nice coverto increase sales of both the CD andCoverGirl's products?
