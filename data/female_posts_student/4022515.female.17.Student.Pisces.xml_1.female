It was good cuz I wasnt scheduled so I got paid, and if I had stayed home I wouldnt have done anything, so I turned a potentially wasted day into profit. Thats good. I have a huge burn on my elbow from wrestling with kevin on my trampoline last night, it hurts. I'm tired, but I need to go to kroger soon b/c I'm fixing dinner tonite for me and mary cuz both my parents are at work. My friend wants me to go drinking with him tonite, but I dont think I'm up for it. At least not while everything is up in the air like this with Kevin and me. I'm not in the partying mood at all. I'm kinda bummed, but I dont wanna talk about how much I miss him and stuff, cuzI don't want to pressure him too much. I want him to make his decision based on how HE feels, not on me or his friends or whoever. I know its only been two weeks, but it feels like a lifetime. I don't want him to get used to how it is now, becuase it SUCKS!
