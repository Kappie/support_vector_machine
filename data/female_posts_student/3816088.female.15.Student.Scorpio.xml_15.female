I like never make phone calls during the day or anything. My dad has a feeling that since I was the last phone added that i get all the junk on mine and all the extra stuff on my bill and stuff and like when we went to St.Louis my dad forgot his charger so my phone was used as his, mine, my moms, and my little brothers (my older brother will not let anyone touch his) i dont know. i was just like shocked when I found out and stuff and so was my brother and my dad so he went to the store and they found out they made a mistake but we still owed like 300 dollars total. Its cRaZy!!! My dad really isnt that upset because he never told me that I couldnt do certain things and stuff and since it is during the summer and I was kinda bound to go over at sometime. But I am now supposed to use my house phone to make calls during the daytime (unless its past 9 or on weekeends). So ask me if you want my home number!  i love you guys!! heather
