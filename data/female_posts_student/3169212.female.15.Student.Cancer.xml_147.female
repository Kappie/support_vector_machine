Baka:  Never underestimate the voice power of a demon and a pirate.  Buddha:  *time elapsed*  It's been two minutes, they must have broken some record.  Baka:  Damn!  Buddha:  Hey, watch the language.  You're the good demon, remember?  Baka:  Can't help it.  Kuronue:  *time elasped two hours**holding new bottle of whiskey*  What are you two watching?  Baka:  *snoring**wakes with start*  Wha...what?!  Where're the fronkeys?!  Kuronue:  Never mind.  Why are Sparrow and that other guy screaming?  Buddha:  Something about being stuck with Jen for a long time.  Kuronue:  I'd scream too.  Baka:  *looks up at Kuronue**blinks multiple times*  Uh...  Kuro!  You're back!  *goes back to sleep**mumbling*  The fronkeys...  The fronkeys are coming.  Has the jury reached a verdict?  Kuronue:  I'm afraid to ask.  Buddha:  She talks in her sleep.  Fronkeys are something she heard about from one of her favorite stand-up comedians.  I'm not sure about the strange judge thing.  Baka:  *shouts*  Fronkeys with bananas!  Yay!  *snores*  Fronkeys!  Kuronue and Buddha:  *cast confused stares at Baka*  Baka:  Fronkeys!  Kuronue:  I'm just about to leave for the demon world.  Wanna come?  Buddha:  Sure.  Baka:  Kura is cute with red hair.  *completely oblivious to what she is saying*  Buddha:  Who's Kura?  Kuronue:  *grins evilly*  Kura's short for Kurama.  I think I might stay after all.  Baka:  Kurama...
