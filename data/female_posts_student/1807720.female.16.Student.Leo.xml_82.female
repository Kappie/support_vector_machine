And well I got myself some clicky shoes, I have been wanting them forever.  And well this song/poem just came to me in my mind like about 10 minutes ago so I started writting down what I could hear in my mind.     Fighting the Cold  Out in the cold I’m lost In a reality of wandering Dreams trapped within themselves Stored up on the shelves  I think now is the time To unlock the cupboards Throw away the keys Let your dreams just be  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  You are the only one who knows you know where you want to go If someone comes along one day And tells you to throw your dreams away  Say “hey, do I look like a fool?” They tell you dreams are foolish and you should go away And you say, “don’t tell me where to go or what to do” This is the way that it will be because I believe that  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  The reflection staring back at you Tells your something like dreams can come true If you believe and if you have faith You will get swept to a land far away  Your heart will guide you to the Promised Land Never know if dreaming comes to and end So if you’re in doubt don’t give up on yourself You have to believe that things will work out, and I said  You got to be you You got to be whom you are inside You have to believe That you can succeed Your willpower will override All your fears washed away Forget them for today these dreams are here to stay Follow your heart; don’t do what your told In this life just keep on fighting the cold  ~Vanessa
