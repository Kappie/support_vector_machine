I'm trying to psych myself into the fact that it's 10:00, but in my head it feels like around 6:00 or 7:00. ((well maybe you shouldn't have slept until 1:00 in the afternoon?? Well maybe I wanted to! Well maybe you shouldn't!))  tomorrow is president's day, and like most holidays, I wouldn't care except that school's out. It's the fact that I have to go back to "that place" on Tuesday that I think is making me depressed. And it's not really in a sad way, I just feel like doing absolutely nothing, and the thought of all that studying and moving around I'll have to start doing soon is absolutely horrific.   after the kids went to bed last night I watched a Daria marathon on their satellite. I love daria, especially the way she talks in monotones and adds cultural references to EVERYTHING that most people wouldn't get and some of which I don't get.   we're carrying four leaf clovers, sending chocolates, and commending our presidents all in less than a week. Wild stuff huh?  I don't have much to say except that I'm severely hurting for some social interaction and hopefully SOMEBODY will call me up. But since I know that's not gonna happen, I'm just using this as an excuse to type.   "Everything in everybody's lives is out of control, we just tell ourselves otherwise so we can function"  I think I may have already said this, but I'm reading a book right now called Artemis Fowl((foul?)), and it's really good. It's about this 12 year old genius mobster who steals all the money from the fairy government. Very thrilling stuff.  this morning((afternoon)) I came in and had 19 messages. Now I NEVER have 19 messages because I'm on here so much and I always check them as soon as I get them. Most of them were valentines! I felt so loved!  oh oh I know what I can do! I can catch up on reading blogs.   w00t  ::failed attempt at being cheerful::  w00t??  ::nope::
