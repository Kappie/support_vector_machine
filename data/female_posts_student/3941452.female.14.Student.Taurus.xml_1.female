I dunno whats up with girls nowa days but they seem to think that acting like you're a ditzy blonde is cute.Well it's NOT- it's incredibly stupid and annoying! What do they want people to believe- that they can't think for themselves? Oh and what gets me is that some guys actually hang around these girls. Personally i'd rather slap the chick and tell her to stop faking it. And the clothes some girls wear- my goodness they are so sleasy! With their little booty shorts and low tight shirts. Its just nasty nobody wants to see that. What ever happened to having a lil decentcy and actually wearing something that covers you up? You don't have to dress sleasily for people to like you and if u do- well then your prob not a very fun person to be around anyways.          Sorry this is one of my more "angry" posts- i usually don't like writing them but this is something that will make the world a better place! haha
