You know what, i need to get this damn game down before I do something stupid because all I've been doing is frustrating myself.  In other news, the song 'memory' is addictive. Very. And I'm mad that I can't go see sugarcult and fallout boy on the 17 or whenever it is bcuz of the confirmation party. Whatevr, support your buddies. Yay.  The girls in our grade have also found a new heart-throb among the boys of langley. Wasn't suspecting that one. Especially not this one. I bet it's the hair. Let's hope it doesn't get cut.   Also, I just got news from Chandler that we're not going to the concert on friday night @ 9:30. Right, well- at least I hadn't bought my ticket yet.  I told paula i was in love with andrew hardenbergh today. She believed me. It was funny. The end of that story.   Walkie Talkie Man by Steriofuse is a great song. Listen to it.
