Why don't i really want to go?  because there's nothing in Virginia.  95% of the people i've told "yeah i'm going to virginia for spring break" have said "what the hell is in Virginia?".  NOTHING is in Virginia is the bottom line.  You ever wonder why the colonists from Jamestown had kids and then those kids went to go settle out west?  Because they realized NOTHING WAS FREAKING IN VIRGINIA.  So they went to California, lol, and realized they could create stuff like DisneyLand and Rodeo Drive and it would be so much super cooler than Virginia.  Thats the history cliffnotes by Taylor, thank you for your time.  My dad is bringing his laptop so i can have communication with the rest of the world and keep you updated on my boredom status.  Thank god for that, but no promise i'll actually be able to talk much since my freaking mom will probably monitor me and all this.  We could've gone anywhere in the world........Finland, Norway, England, Ibiza, Brazil......but she picks Virginia.  Do i care about American history?  to a point, but i find world history so much more interesting.  I think i'll be bringing tons of books to read/music to listen to and homework to keep myself occupied.    In other news, i got a 1040 on my PSAT.  Go me!  I rock!  So techinically, as of now, i could get into a junior college!  Just think how much better my scores will be after i take Algebra II!!!!    Sports Update: Coppell kicks the hell out of Jesuit 6-1!!!!!!!!!  It was so awesome and we were 7 players short.  It was brilliant and i'm very proud of my boys.  Dallas also tied 2-2 with Philadelphia, which means we're 3 points away from overtaking San Jose!!!  We will catch up, i know we will.  Coppell plays Marcus over Spring Break which i'm going to miss because i'll be in freaking virginia.  Tell me how it goes you guys, so i'll know how my boys are doing!  I'm sure it'll be a win.  Good luck to the cowboys at their tourney in Colorado!!  Kick those yankees' asses!!    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense: he wore the ugly jacket.  i think his relationship with that broad is over.  lol that reminds me of something funny that happened lunch.  i was telling taylor stewart all about this kid that me and lauren stalked and i was like "yeah he's been hanging out with this total broad" and she's like "Broad?".  I had to explain to her that a broad is a slut, particularly a hockey whore.  Taylor says "So wait, hockey players have their own private prostitution group?".  LOL!!!  I was like "yeah generally".  hehe, good times.  alright, i need to go pack for my death trip.  i can only pray that there will be hot guys to keep my mind busy while i learn about good old american history......  Be safe on spring break!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
