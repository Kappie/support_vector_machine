It was amazing. For starters, I should say that my plan for the day was 1) go to church, 2) come home, 3) take a nap, and 4) work on my huge load of make up work. I am much happier that it turned out differently.   After church, Paul and I went to Taco Bell...simple, delicious, and something we both love. After Taco Bell was Wal-Mart, then finally my house. When we got to my house we kinda couldn't do anything because Slectues and her mom came by. They still want me to go to Florida with them this summer!!! Anyway...once they left Paul and I went and "watched" Fight Club. Good movie, but it was better just laying in his arms again (not to mention...*sigh*). I'm not going to forget the, "you better not get me sick again..." "don't worry! I can't. I'm on antibiotics." *grin*kiss* That was nice. And then there was when we were messing around with each other (play fighting):  "YOU NOT MY FRIEND NO MORE!" -me...I leave the room "That's okay...I'll find new friends."-Paul "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!"  That was followed by me pushing him into the other room ("OOH!! You're in trouble now!!" calls out my mom), pinning him on the bed ("I like being in trouble"), and kissing him senseless. Good times...Good times. So now "trouble" is on ongoing thing. Paul does everything he can to get in trouble. I really love him. He's so sweet when we are being serious.   I have no good way to end this...so ... peace.
