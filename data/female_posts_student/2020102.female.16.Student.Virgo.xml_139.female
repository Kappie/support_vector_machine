We are northbound on Interstate 55 to Chicago, and I'm having a hard time waking up. These beautiful farms in Southern Illinois are big and lonely and spread themselves out for miles, broken only by the occasional Interstate golf course or exit oasis of fuel pumps and fast food. Morning is good. There is so much that is good in my life. I feel this need to quantify all that has been given me before I fall once again into telling you what I need or want or miss. I have spent the last 3 months gathering. Gathering thoughts and memories and time and family and home. I spent a month out in Oregon and northern California kayaking on perfect rivers every single day with a dear friend. I spent weeks alone at my family's river cabin thankful to simply build a gate or work in the yard and not say a word for days at a time. I spent a week on a beautiful island off the coast of South Carolina with my sweet family. I watched four of my closest friends get married in weddings that actually meant something. I watched the sun rise over the Atlantic Ocean and I watched it set over the Pacific. I have been given much. And it's with this sense of the richness and the depth of what I've been given that I tell you how profoundly un-rich and un-deep I feel lately. It's hard to explain the state of "emotionless-ness" that I'm in right now, except to say that I absolutely hate it. It's not really a numb sensation where you feel somehow oblivious to all that's around you. (That particular sensation can actually be really nice sometimes - like a long Sunday afternoon lying on the couch in and out of sleep watching two football teams that you care nothing about play a completely meaningless game). Just turning your brain off - however it happens - is a good thing every now and then. No, this is more of a state of - I don't know - it's more like being stuck inside on a Sunday afternoon when you could be somewhere else doing something else. It's kind of like boredom. When you're bored you're not just idle, you're idle with a knawing sense that you don't want to be idle at all. It's like having to sit when you want to stand. Or trying to go to sleep when you're wide-awake. It's really just anxiousness without really knowing what you're anxious about. However it's defined, there is nothing more tiresome - to wake up with it and go to sleep with it. It's a cruel thing, this lack of emotion. To be bored with music and life and, of all things, God. That is a cruel thing because music and life and, of all things, God, are the gifts to me for which I want to be, and should be, and usually am so eternally thankful. And part of me feels like a spoiled child even mentioning these things to you. (As I said, I have been given much). But for some reason I feel this strange need to tell you these things. And it's not because I've found some solution or have some moral to tell - that's probably pretty obvious. I think it's partly because I have this hope that you would actually be able to relate somehow, and even though I'll probably never know for sure that's somehow quite settling. But I think it's mostly because I'd like to ask you to pray for me. I hope you don't think that selfish, but I am certain that no one thing could be more valuable to be right now than your prayer. And please know this: I still know without question that God is good and real and faithful - in fact, it's with that truth that I look hopefully and expectantly forward. After all, God is bigger than mountains and oceans and even my faithless boredom." -Bebo Norman, "Journals" (which is a thing on his website)  "I did not realize this, but apparently weasels are relentless creatures." -Bebo Norman, "Journals" (it makes sense in the context, but it's funnier this way.)  "Dear Lord, teach me how to rest and how to love and how to hope and how to search each day for a look at you. Teach me how to dream and how to cry and how to bend but not break at the sight of you." -Bebo, "Journals"  "I have beaten my brain for weeks to come up with something meaningful to write, and have found instead that the gift of the last few weeks has been that there is nothing all too meaningful in my brain. In other words, my brain has successfully been turned off (or down at least) in a way that has allowed me to simply just be. And that is something that I pray for quite often. By the way, none of this is to say that when my brain happens to be on, that the meaningful thoughts just pile up one behind another until they spill over into well constructed profundities and songs. I do think that I'm probably at my best in my songs as far as organizing any thoughts that I may have, but the sad truth is that I'm not a very prolific songwriter. So, if my thoughts are at their best in the songs that I write, and I write maybe 8 or 10 songs every year, and if each song is about 4 or 5 minutes long, then I figure that I've got, at best, about 50 minutes a year or 8.219 seconds a day where I'm full of good, meaningful thought. (I think I just depressed myself.) At any rate, I've decided that rather than focus on what I've been thinking lately (since there has not been much of that), I should simply just focus on what I've been doing. And what have I been doing?. Well, to be quite honest, not a whole lot. And it's been really nice." -Bebo, "journals"  "I suppose I might live this cycle, this inconsistency, for the rest of my life. God, I hope not. If nowhere else, I pray that I might find consistency in just this one portion of my lifeÂ·this part where I sit down quiet each day to wait. To wait on emotion, or spirit, or words. To wait on songs, and silence, and coffee. To wait on God. LORD Jesus, teach me in this day how to wait on you. Remind me every day to sit and wait even if just for a short while on God.     A quiet and peaceful morning. I have a new coffee table - candles lit on top of it. Dad had a heart attack Saturday morning. God saved him. I want to go to church. But it's only Tuesday. " -Bebo, "Journals"  "I think this is my place now. It's a matter of finding the right chair. It's all about perspective. Funny how the right room can feel like the wrong room from the wrong chair." -Bebo, "Journals"  "I guess that's the bottom line - when it all comes down to it, all of our lives are pretty ordinary. For all the people we may be in front of each night, we still go home to our little families and our neighborhoods and a handful of good friends who know us and love us just as we are. For all the cities that we travel to, we all have one little picture in the back of our minds that looks like home. And when it all comes down to it, the only thing extraordinary about any of us is the fact that there is this great big God who has seen fit to take this great big Love and somehow fit it into our little insignificant hearts. That's extraordinary. That's worth living for, no matter how the living looks. I am overwhelmed right now with the fact that God is good. I think life as a believer comes down to one thing thankfulness. Right now I'm thankful to have played for 14,000 people. I'm thankful for two nights in my own bed. I'm thankful for snow in Indiana and rain in Nashville. I'm thankful that God loves me in spite of myself. I'm thankful that there is nothing extraordinary about this life apart from the giver of it. I am thankful that God is good." -Bebo, "Journals"  "A certain perspective shift can happen at times like this. It's not a decision or a choice. It just takes hold and you look up one day and realize that you've been seeing color instead of black and white. It's not a decision or a choice. It's more of a grace. And everything seems to be cast in that color now. Every scenario - best and worst case - seems to be cast in that color. I think it's the color of peace. And I can't seem to get away from it; but then again, I'm not trying too hard." -Bebo, "Journals"   "I guess no one told them in Minnesota that spring is here. Two days ago, I was in Tennessee kayaking in 70-degree weather. So I stepped off the bus this morning (it was actually about 1pm but, hey, that's morning to me), fully garbed in my Chaco sandals and a short sleeved T - my monotonously typical spring wardrobe. Shocking. That's all I can say - simply shocking. Once I dug out the snow that had lodged itself between my toes, I realized that we weren't in Kansas anymore (literallyâ€¦we were in Kansas City when I went to sleep last night). I learned quite tragically that the high temperature today in Minneapolis, MN would barely break freezing, and so I sulked. I was truly sad. And then I turned belligerent. Despite the many cries that shouted, 'SOCKS, you MUST wear socks here in Minnesota,' I stubbornly refused to yield to the peer pressure and stood fast in my Chaco's. Do you know why? It's the principle of the thing. I mean, in the name of all that is good - regardless of the popular opinion in this fine state - it's SPRING already." -Bebo, "Journals"   "It's the little consistencies in life that you begin to miss when you're out on the road for a living. Little things likeâ€¦the same silverware at every meal, or even knowing where you're meals are going to be without following little signs that say 'Catering,' or good towels (not the brand-new-never-been-washed-won't-soak-up-a-bit-of-moisture-but-will-leave-behind-a-million-little-fibers-of-towel-lint-all-over-your-body-towels that we seem to have at every venue). Little things... like the changing of the seasons. You can't even count on that out here on the road. But the consistencies that do happen in this particular line of life are pretty incredible. The fact that each and every night I get back up on a stage and sing for a living - well, that's amazing. The fact that you guys sing back - that's even more amazing. There's a reason why musicians say that they play music - we don't say that we work music, we say that we play it. And to think, this is my job. They say that if you love what you do, then you never work another day in your life." -Bebo, "Journals"  Bebo rocks my face off. And my cousin gave me a (burned) copy of his latest cd. Yay.
