Errm I guess it was on Thursday I went over to the Schindhettes to babysit (Andrew P. calls it the Shitty's becuase he couldn't hear what we were saying lol), and at like 11pm or sometime late I text messaged Brian saying how bored I was, and he called me back.  He was freaking high which pissed me off, but we talked for a bit and then when I got home I called him again and talked.  And the next night we did teh same thing...  Its so stupid because I like him so much now, but I refuse to date him because he smokes.  Maybe he'll get over it now that Karl moved away.  *wishful thinking*  Eek I have to go to lunch, so I will post the rest later!
