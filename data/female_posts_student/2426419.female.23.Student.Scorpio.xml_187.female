I feel okay . . . taking my Z-pac, those little pink miracles in pill-form, getting lots of rest (a.k.a waking up at 10:00), etc. And, although I haven't been to the gym, I feel very energetic as if I had worked out. I guess I'm working out my mind. (How's that for elementary school teacher fluff?) I read about 100 plus pages of Madame Bovary yesterday, and I'm going to finish up the last few pages and then read some commentary on it, then start on another book. I've been home for 4 (going on 5) months now and haven't really read anything. My mind has been dull. I forgot how obsessed I could get with reading.  I am anxious to get to the U of Cincinnati in the fall. I think that it's going to be great. And I'm thinking about writing a romance novel just for the money. I'll become famously known as "The Harlequin Virgin." YAY. Or, perhaps the Harlequin Romance Maiden . . . that sounds more seductively innocent.  Well, back to Madame Bovary. I can't believe that she dies in the end! (Sorry, Joey*).  * Friends reference
