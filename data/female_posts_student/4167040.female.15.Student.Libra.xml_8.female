I feel like I'm in a better mood right now than I was yesterday morning. The thing on my mind is going back to school though, and I REALLY don't want to. This summer has just been amazing...and I've made lots of memories...I guess I just don't want to move on. Well, tonight Michael is calling at 9:00 p.m. so that should end my day well. I guess that's all for now.      "Back To California"     How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye   Ten different ways to enjoy this night   Can’t do this anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye   You could never let me in   Holding on until the end The time I waste just to say goodbye   Out of your way I could do this right   Can’t see you anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll stay   Just to say goodbye, say goodbye Leave it all the fights and all   Summer’s getting colder   Drive all night to hold you tight   Back to California   Days went by    We waited and I guess we’re getting older   We couldn’t win in the end You’re gone   I’m miles away   Turning out your lights   Ten different ways I could end this night   Can’t do this anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye, say goodbye Leave it all the fights and all   Summer’s getting colder   Drive all night to hold you tight   Back to California   Days went by    We waited and I guess we’re getting older   We couldn’t win in the end You’re gone
