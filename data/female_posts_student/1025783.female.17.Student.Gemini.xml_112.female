I whispered quickly, almost frightened.  Her form moved slowly so I could see her whole face. She sank one hand into the cool, damp sand and began to sift it thoughtfully through her fingers. She gave me a comforting smile- always so affectionate. "No, my dear,"she said slowly, as though words were a burden, "They have no idea. Let us rest now." I turned my gaze away from her and back to the ocean. Vast and powerful, it raised its mighty fists and surged great white stallions ahead, careening them dangerously into the mountainside. So quiet, I thought, so quiet on such a painful night. I kicked off my scuffed shoes, tossing them towards a blanket we had set up, then forgotten. My feet wriggled into the cold mush of sea water and sand. She looked over, shot me a glance and opened her mouth as though to ridicule, but then closed it promptly. Her mouth made a loud popping noise as it closed and I giggled. She looked suprised, but then laughed faintly, turning back to watch the ocean. I leaned against my palms and began to rise. "Parker," She said softly, "Oh Parker, where are you going?" I stood up, brushing the sand from my faded trousers and shaking my limbs as a boy of 12 does. "Just to go feel the water, Cora" I said in an almost pleading voice. Cora's eyes turned upwards towards me. The moonlight lapped in those dark, serious pools, "Oh...please Parker, just stay with me and wait." Her small form pleaded silently with me.I sighed loudly, an exasperated sigh but a defeated on at that. I dropped to the ground, sending a spray of sand into the dark night.
