If he calls anymore, I'm gonna either not answer..or just tell him straight up that it's over. I dunno. He was my weakness. I'm sick of dealing with all the shit...waiting for phone calls and knowing that i'm the other girl. I was just a booty call i guess. But NO MORE! and it feels really good that i have finally come to the conclusion that this has to end. I guess i'm glad that I was the one that made the decision. it feels pretty damn good. but at the same time kinda sad. I really do want a guy. and it sucks. blagh. oh well.   in other news! YEARBOOKS ARE IN! wahoooooo they come out friday..but staff gets to see them tomorrow night at our little party. weeeeeee. I'm so excited. Other than that, everythings been boring. nothing exciting.   I feel so empowered! i dunno why...i guess for the first time, it has been my decision to end something with a guy. i feel strong! wahoo so there will be no more boring entries about "him". yay
