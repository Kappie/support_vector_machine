I need to rethink my feelings for matt...well its not that i need to rethink my feelings for him...cause i know my feelings for him...but i need to rethink about what his feelings are for me...and if they are true as to what he says...i'm getting extremely ticked off...and i felt bad cause i was on the phone with Bren so i sounded pissed when i got off thep hone with him but it had nothing to do with him at all...its matt...i'm not sure whast going on anymore...and i don't nkow what to do...i think my feelings for him may be a lot stronger than his are for me....but he said that we're going to talk on the phone tomorrow hopefully...but after he gets home from work which is at like 3am my time...and i'm most likely going to be asleep considering i have summer school the next day...maybe i wasted that $4 for a calling card...i dont' even know anymore...i'm fucking confused...and i spent half an hour crying over a guy...i NEVER cry over a guy...this is over ONE single guy...who i have never even MET in real life before...i dunno what to fucking do....i just don't wanna be wasting my heart and soul on liking this guy if he ain't going to return any feelings back to me at all...i didn't even ask him but i was going to ask him if he has even written me a single word at all on a piece of paper....but i'm pretty sure the answer to that is no...but i'm afraid to find out although i want to find out...i think i care for this guy more than i know myself...i know i care abot him a lot...but maybe its more than i know myself....and if thats the case i think i might have to tone it down a bit...cause i dunno...inmy case i'm not use to being head over heels for a guy without having the returned feeling....but i dont' know what he's feeling cause he won't tell me...cause thats the way he is...which is totally unfair to me...but at least he told me that you likes me...but i felt that i had to squeeze it out of him...and that he only said that he did just to satisfy me and shut me up......fuck i dunno what to do anymore....everything is falling to pieces for me....i dont' know what to do....i dont' know what i feel anymore...   matt says:   hi hi  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   hi  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   surprised you still rememeber me  matt says:   hehe  matt says:   quite the comic aint ya  HoMe AlOnE {CaLl If NeEdEd 905-580-9982} ¦-¦óÔ«ér ©¦-¦¡¢«AsIaN/iRiSh PrIdE! says:   i'm serious...
