I got a call which i can't really determine if it is going to turn out to be something good or bad...i guess the rest of the day will have to pan out before I make any assumtions. but I found out this intresting info...I hate hores...ha ha....I never used to get along with girls becuase they are so catty... but when i went to high school it turned out i developed many "girlfriends"....ha ha...but today I realised that are still hores out there. This girl..well...we will just call her the hore...well she wirtes all this stuff about diante...how he is a sexy porn star and dumb shit.. and then they go out to the movies yesterday...ok me and this hore were supposed to be cool and everything...me and diante were trying to work things out and she and her horeness try and move in on him...come on you know that is horeish??? Or maybe i am over reacting but...I am still calling her a hore! What kind of girl does that to another girl they know and knows that there are still feeling between me and diante...I dunno...a hore!! O well i am over it she is a hore....So cheer is today and my body could hurt more...weight lifting, running, conditiong....I am going to die!! Going out to dinner though so at least there is food to look foward to! Oh and i got to thank my best friend karen...I love you...my lil rock...I would be in the middle of the ocean drownding if not for you....Hey there is this thing..a house party flyer we got last ngiht...we want to go...but you have to be 18...anyone got fake ids??? ha ha
