There are TWO rules when answering these questions: 1) Only ONE answer to each. Of course its tough - thats the point! 2) Each blog/blogger may only be used ONCE  What blogger inspired you to FINALLY start a blog?    urlLink Indiscretions    What blog do you visit the most often everday?   urlLink And another thing...    What blogger do you think you have the most in common with?    urlLink Leticia McKenzie , given age and self-professed dorkishness. In no way do I claim to be either as sexy or as brilliant as Leticia!   Which blog can you be sure will make you pee a little you laugh so hard?    urlLink The Sneeze    Which blogger leaves you the best/funniest comments?    urlLink Machine609    What blogger do you wish would update more often?    urlLink bellow    Which blog do you wish more people would read?   urlLink one child left behind     Which blog do you learn the most from?   urlLink The Real Planet Earth Site    What blog is your newest addition?   urlLink Whaz Up    Who has been on your blogroll the longest?   urlLink Cheekysquirrel    Whose blogroll would you LOVE find yourself on?   urlLink Que Sera Sera    Whose bloglinker list were you the happiest to find yourself on?   urlLink Bakerina  ok, maybe just a list, but whatever   If you could write like any blogger, who would it be?   urlLink tequila mockingbird    What blogger are you the happiest you've "met?"   urlLink popcultureatemybrain    Which blog do you recommend the most?  oh, man. there's a reason I had to break it into 3 lists.   Who is the next person you'll add to your bloglinker list?  Uhh. Either the next person who links me, or the next person who makes me stay up late or almost be late for work because I'm reading their archives.   Who is the blogger you hope to meet in "real" life?   urlLink David  - I think I'm still engaged to him, and I'm not into that whole "Married by America" blind wedding stuff. No, sir.   Which blogger do you admire?   urlLink aethele.   the way she writes about her life, I sometimes don't realize how different it is from my own, and how strong this woman must be!   Who would you trust with your blog while you were away?  Psh... honestly, I haven't actually met any of these people, so I don't think I'll ever really know if they're actually scary old men.   Well, some of you are scary old men, but you know what I mean.   Which blog has your favorite design?   urlLink ich zwoje  has a neat one, but I don't recommend clicking it unless you have a pretty fast connection.  How many blogs are on your blogroll(s) 35
