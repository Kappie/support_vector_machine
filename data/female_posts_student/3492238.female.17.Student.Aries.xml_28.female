I'm the type of person who doesn't get bummed out if someone forgets my birthday - because if they eventually remember and send me a card or something, I get to have a birthday moment all over again. I know some people aren't birthday people - they don't like the attention, or they don't see what the big deal is. But there's one thing about birthdays you can't deny - they're a mark in time worth paying attention to.Each one is like an official acknowledgement that you did, in fact, live another year. And even if it wasn't a happy year, all the more reason to be proud or even dance on a table, if you're really excited. Because you got through it. And I think that in itself is an accomplishment.
