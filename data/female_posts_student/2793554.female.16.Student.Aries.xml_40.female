I seriously turned off my phone and tv and computer and music and stared at my science book for 5 minutes reading the same line over and over and didnt learn anything.  today is add day. blarrghh... Ive already cleaned my room, made a shirt, done the rest of my homework, and GONE INSANE. Oh- and talked on the phone for hours and hours. Maybe ill just study tomorrow during all my other classes.  I got glasses today and i look SOOOO geeky! (secretly theyre sort of cute... but shh! dont tell anyone!) I could dress up like a little schoolgirl! and i just might. Except its supposed to snow tomorrow... poop.  Dylan is on speed. Haha. Im talking to him and hes just like "talk faster! youre so slow! aieeeee!!" And now hes reading comics i guess. funfunfun.
