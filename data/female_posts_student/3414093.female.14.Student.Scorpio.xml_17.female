Perhaps you just want to ruin my life no matter what it takes. I wish you were dead. You drove me to trying to kill myself, you and Eileen (She shall never be forgiven either) did, but really YOU are those who should parish, not I. I have friends, people who care. Do you? Do you go out and have fun? Or do you just spend your nights in front of the TV or the computer just watching me? Recording everything I do. Well stop. You are  NOT  my father any more. Stay away from me, in both the real world and this cyber world we call the internet. I want nothing to do with you.  Ever . I hope you both die terrible, excrutiating deaths. And now, my little elaboration on the 'structured' lifestyle that presides in your hell hole you call home: We all know you smoke pot, and GROW pot. One time me and my friends smoked pot from your stash. And Spartan smoked it all the time. You look at pornography on a regular basis...and you accuse ME of looking at it?? What is that about. I don't even...like if I did I might understand why you would say that. But I don't. Now, may I ask how you met Eileen? Was it not over the internet? How could you be sure she wasn't some raving lunatic? Well...you shouldn't have taken that risk. She   IS   a raving lunatic. Okay, and onto your 'structuring' my life (when I was there): Yelling at me for the tiniest things I did wrong, every week, every day. You ruined my christmas, my new years eve, my life, with your 'little chats' trying to make me a 'better person'. And NEVER did you congradulate me on anything.  urlLink PRoN  is a perfect example of that. Sure, I wrote ONE paragraph on you guys...ONE. But the rest was well written. You HAVE to admit that. And guess what Jacques, I'm getting my book published soon. But I had to re-write the first 8 chapters. You know why? Cause I wrote those when I lived at your house. And since I moved out my writing capabilities have improved ten fold. And don't expect a free copy. You won't get one...the only thing I would ever even consider sending you is an envelope of Anthrax. Is that still on the news lately? I ask you cause I know how the only highlights of your life are the things you see on TV. Like kids being abused. Speaking of which, lets re-visit some of my child-hood memories. Like that time in Quebec at that motel when I was crying cause I couldn't sleep and I was home sick. Do you remember what you did? You hit me. Hard. Which definitly didn't stop my crying...sure I tried to be a little more quiet as not to get hit again, but I cried. The whole night. And do you remember that time you wouldn't let me say good night to mom who was down stairs. Every time I tried to exit my room you would jump out and grab me by the wrist or whatever else you could grab onto and threw me back in my room. It scared me, so much that I tried to run to mom. I screamed for her. I armed myself to try and get to her, but you took the big cardbored roll from my hand and hit me with it. Do you remember that Jacques? Do you? Cause I sure do. I've never been able to forget it. Did you know that when you and mom split I went to councelling? I think you found out about that after the fact when I gave you that letter and you ask if mom got one too and I asked why she would. I have NO issues with mom. None. Just you. Cause YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. Oh, so back to councelling. I drew pictures of my family. In everyone of them you were coloured red. Red for Rage. And hate. The hate you had for everything. And I had red too. But only in the pictures where I was near you. I have always hated you Jacques. Always. And that will never change. And I will never come back. I think a word about how much I love it here is appropriate: Here I can talk freely. Here people listen to me, enjoy hearing my opinion. Don't critisize EVERYTHING I do. Here people love me. Cherish me. You never did any of that. Here I do things by my own free will. I bake for everyone, I make lunch, dinner. I peeled some potatoes for Mike and my brunch one day. He was out working and I decided to make some hashbrowns and hotdogs. He was thankful. Didn't make some comment like 'its about time' or 'do i know you?' Mike is more of a father than you have EVER been to me. So Jacques, stay away from me, and stop reading the things I write.  I hate you, Elisha  P.S. Stephanie did not get drunk. She had some pizza the night before that had made her very sick. Stephanie hadn't drank anything. DO NOT drag my friends into the issues you have with the family that hates you. I'm NOT your family anymore. And my friends are even less of your business than I am.  Have an awful life.
