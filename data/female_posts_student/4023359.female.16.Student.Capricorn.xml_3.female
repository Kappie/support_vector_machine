But, it still sucks working morning hours because A.) you can't sleep in  and B.) everyone is grouchy.  Explanation: A.) I have wanted to sleep in so bad Monday and Today, I mean, mom was yelling at me Monday morning trying to get me up.  And today, dad came into my room at 6:20 and told me it was almost 6:30.  I jumped out of bed and started putting my clothes on and then started fixing me something for breakfast.  I put one of those crosanwiches  (sp?!?) that you can buy without having to go to Burger King at wal-mart in the microwave.  I didn't eat all of.  I woke up this morning feeling very sick...I don't know why I even went into work today.  When I got there I could do nothing but sneeze and sniffle. lol Becky asked me if i was gonna make it.  I told her yeah, I had no other choice.  Then she said, "well, no you really don't have a choice, you're the best person I've got this morning and any morning, as a matter of fact."  Then she walked away, I was like whoo-hoo... on the inside. lol  B.) Everyone is grouchy because they have to get up early. lol  'nuff said. lol  well, i've run out of things to talk to you about my working experiences the past two days...nothing really interesting has gone on. lol  I just can't wait for our new store to get built and opened.  I'm starting to get tired of the Hartselle Mcd's. heh, gotta go! buh-byes!
