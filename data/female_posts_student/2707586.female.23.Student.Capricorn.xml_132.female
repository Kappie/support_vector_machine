(hitting on girls took place the whole wkend starting in the car ride down until we got back home. in fact, it never stops w/ them. according to jon, if his mouth is open, he's hitting on you.) anyway, we all walked the beach and got our feet wet. afterward, we road the skyscraper, which is nothing more than a 165 ft pole w/ a basket on each end. at the touch of a botton, it spins you around, while the basket will also flip and turn you up side down. of course, in some instances, you are racing downward upside down w/ the thought that you are going to skim your head on the pavement. of course it never happens, but its neat to experience. also the view from the top was amazing. after the ride, it was time to eat seafood. mmm. it was good. our poor waitress tolerated the guys quiet nicely and possibly even enjoyed their attemps of trying to get her number. meter ran out and it was getting late, so homeward bound we were. ahh. theres no place like home. the adventure was over, but one i will never forget. just as i'm unpacking, i receive a call from joe. dinner at the cellar was the plan. next, he calls jon for me to tell him to come back and pick me up, so we can both travel to meet up w/ him and matt. just when i thought the wkend was over, it was only just beginning...for who knows what the rest of the wk will hold.
