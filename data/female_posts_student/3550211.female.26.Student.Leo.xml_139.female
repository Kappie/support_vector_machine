Unfortunately, my monitor decided to blow. No warning signs. No sharp bright lights exploding onto the screen. Nada. Zilch. Nothing. It just went ... black.   At first I thought it was a power outage. Except the hard drive stayed on. So, I pulled a total computer-illiterate act of despair. I pressed buttons. All sorts of buttons. And many many buttons. And bingo. My blog was published.   Of course, I didn't even realize this until much later. Thankfully, I had a old monitor just laying around. Actually, I had been meaning to throw it away for some time now, but I just hadn't gotten around to it. Everything happens for a reason, I suppose. And after my financial aid check comes I will buy a grand new monitor.   So, there you have it. My excuse, or apology, or whatever you want to call it. And if you're wondering, why don't I just delete the damn mess of a blog, well, it's because I told myself I would  never  delete a blog once it's been published. Good or bad, I want to remember them all.   So be it.   Tomorrow it's back to work. We'll talk politics over bagels and lox. A fruit salad would be nice to. Maybe you could bring that. I'll bring the coffee. See you then.
