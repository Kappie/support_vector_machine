We hung out today and everyone was over. Hassan, Danny, Collin, Corbin, Makensie and Kyle. It was fun... Danny and Makensie I know had fun, lol. Well me and Corbin did end up making out. Which was my one dream, lol..And it happens but I stopped after a couple of minutes. I felt weird doing it. Like I thought it was going to be the feeling I get when I like the person, but there was so much on my mind I couldnt even think positive about Corbin and I. I miss Ryan and I know I shouldnt.. And there would be Mike. The one kid  I loved and still love. I left back in Maryland. I just couldnt do it because even tho he ended up making out with this one chic and liking my best friend Kasey..I just couldnt do it!! Mike and I should be together but we're not and that drives me insane... I just cant deal with guys right now, I'm so afraid of actuyally letting things happen with my and Corbin because I dont want it to end up like a Cameron thing. I want to not do the things I do cause of Mike... I just need not worry about guys tho... But in the end Im happy and sad..
