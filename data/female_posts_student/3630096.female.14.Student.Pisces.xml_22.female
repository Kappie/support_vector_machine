Right after school, I felt so refresh but so tired to study my science. It's the same craps, over and over again, I'm tired... So everybody went down to eat, leaving just a few of us in the classroom. I had no energy to study or even to read...my eyes are drooping and I feel that I can fall asleep any minute... The common test was quite ok...knew most of the answers well...Then they said so band so headed to the band room...haiz...he cut his hair! All of the sudden, the feeling evaporated, he wasn't as shuai as before liaoz...haha. guess I still like to judge people by the cover... Then Mr Singh come upstairs and scold us ar...watever. bloody hell. Then we're informed that band is cancelled, so we went down buy things to eat again...Then headed off to the ping pong table...sat down...met jovan. He owe me the vcd sia! For a year liao...he still haven't give...Then er- saw him, idiot lar...YaoQing teased and teased...make me wanna collasp anytime. That nosy parker...Hmph. Then I saw something. I saw him with ray chua communicating, looking extremely bu shuang. The teacher went off and he sat down. I thought everything is going to be fine. But. He broke down. Right infront of everybody. Crying into his knees. What happened!? I dunno... I felt so helpless... He's my friend for almost a year...but I couldn't do anything to him... Talk for a moment, then jiayi went off, we also go to mama shop, both of them bought mysterious gifts. One is a card with a bracelet, another a toy which spin and flew into the air... So play...went back to school...then play...then go home... Filled with confusing thoughts...to see him break down into tears, that's my first time... Sigh.
