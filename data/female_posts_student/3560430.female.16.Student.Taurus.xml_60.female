But I don't think Bethie wants me to have that done as well. I finally finished that blasted Fraser part but had to cut part and add it into another part, it took some deliberation to figure out if that was a good plan but if I was to add it to the plan Bethany has it makes much more sense, not to mention allows the chapters to flow much better.   Raven's B-day party is getting increasingly closer and I'm having panicks. I've emailed/called Raven so that she can get me the emails for all of them, but she hasn't gotten to it yet, she will though I have faith. We're going to the movies together tomorrow. If we're lucky we'll see two of them, Troy and Shrek 2. This will put me back in the movie loop I hope. It won't cost too much either because if we do decide to go to two movies then we only have to pay one admission each due to the fact that I have special 2 for 1 passes. If we only see one movie we each get to pay 1/2 the admission cost. It really sucks that Spiderman 2 won't allow passes yet because I would replace that with one of the other movies. I'm not sure which though, I'd have to ask Raven, seeing that I would really like to see all three of them.   Today I'm going to the opening of a Greek restaurant run by one of the school members (martial arts school). It's going to be really good! I know this because I've already tried some of their food. Yay! It's really awesome too because we won't have to pay, it's a free trial. Free food is good.   Well if I'm to meet all my day goals I'd best be off. Must check the movie schedules and all that.
