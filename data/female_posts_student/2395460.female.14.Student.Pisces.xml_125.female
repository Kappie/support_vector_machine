I don't even care that  urlLink air bags are designed for men , as long as there's a mirror so I can continually check the wave/frizz ratio of my hair. What if the paramedic cutting me out of my airbag is totally cute?  Actually,  urlLink Boost Mobile  hopes that their new  urlLink i285 mirror phone  will appeal to youths of both sexes so young metros shouldn't feel embarassed about using the i285 to touch up their  urlLink man makeup .  If you want a mirror on your phone, you don't need the i285 or the ultra-femme   urlLink Samsung T500 , you can make your own. See, here's my Treo, after its girly makeover:     I don't remember exactly where I got those stick-on mirrors, but  urlLink Strapya  is a great online source for cell phone charms, keitai(phone straps), and mirrors, direct from Japan, where they really know how to  urlLink dress up a phone . Strapya has tons of  urlLink sticker mirrors for your phone . I also have my eye on the  urlLink good luck charms  and  urlLink scented straps . There's even curry flavor. I want one of everything, that site makes me crazy. I'm placing an order today, would love to see pictures if anyone else orders something.  Hey, did you know that Shakespeare never wrote "Vanity, thy name is woman"? The line in Hamlet is actually  urlLink "Frailty, thy name is woman" . Thank goodness for those airbags.
