(although this site has the much cleaner version) I was amazed at what some people could find in their basements. to top it all of, Ju-on found the original case and strap. and also a 135mm lens. yay! the only problem is i have no where to put it. i lost my cool camera bag and cleaning kit. *pout* it would have worked perfectly...*sigh* oh well  Lily and I have a photography outing on friday. i'm muy excited. We can go hiking and take pictures. yay! all i have to do is get through tonight. *bum bum bum* We have a 6 hour RE retreat. *wah* i think it's going to be hell, but oh well life goes on....and on and on, at least that's what it will feel like tonight.  I also have  urlLink Mermaids . the essence of my family's pop culture. this is how AFG and I came to be the way we are. so i'm excited to inducted new members in the phenomenon known as Mermaids.
