How could you possibly understand? Yeah, I'm doing great, life is a peach But please Never talk to me again. How unfortunate we had to run into one another How unfortunate you chose to come up to me You know how we ended in tension You know the feelings between us So why did you chose to try to talk? Go ahead Talk to my friends But please Never talk to me again. How could you think I would answer you   sensibly? How could you think this would work? Bitch You call me Fuckhead I shoot right back What did you expect? A hug, a kiss, a warm "Oh how I miss you?"? Sorry But things did not end well between us So go ahead Call me a bitch But you'll never know my true feelings You'll never get into my heart again Don't worry You'll never have to yell at me again Don't worry You'll never have to fear my loyalty to you again So continue Entertain your "new junior" Show her (and from what I hear, sell her)  What makes the world go round Maybe show her your sweet and loving side The side that tricked me But never And I mean never Come to me again and call me a bitch I'm not your sweethear anymore I'm not even talking to you There's no point in labeling me And there's another plus You won't be called a fuckhead again Or at least by me.
