Kind of dissapointing, but on the plus side I got to pet highland cattle. Their horns felt really warm. The girl I was with, Brittany was scared of the black one because it was "evil" it kept on hitting the fence with its horns. There was a calf there, it was so cute, but it was kind of shy. I wanted to take it home with me, but it would have been way to big to smuggle out and fit into the car. Klutzy the clown was there too, and yeah, clowns are even scaryer up close. Like I'm sure the guy is nice and all, but once he started telling this little like three year old girl that guys loved hugs and kisses and tickles, well then I thought it was a little weird. He has this guy with him named Mark, he seemed nice enough, didn't really get to talk to him though. I got drenched in the rain... I had an umbrella and towl, but it didnt to much good. Oh, and I want to volenteer at highland village  next year, volenteers get free food, and they have awsome fries there. Yep, so I thought I steped in pee today, because my bathroom floor had this puddle on it beside the toilet, but then I realized it was from the washer, so it wasn't gross anymore. Yeah, thats all the news I have of the day, I don't see anything interesting happening to me. Not that what i wrote about was interesting.
