How could she do this to me?! I thought I was a great friend, but why under the sun would she drop me for Jessi? Her and I have history, they don't. (As if that really matters, but hey, I'm trying).   The tennis party was tonight, and surprise surprise: I wasn't allowed to go! I am actually in trouble with my parents right now, but I don't really care. They are the ones that flip over everything. I am only 16 freaking years old. How the hell am I suppsed to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders, and still remain civil. I just haven't had that much experience with stuff in general. Obviously I need it.  Things are so bad right now. I am just really fatigued, and things are falling around everywhere I go. I am trying, I really am, to keep everything together and to remain somewhat positive about life in general. But, I am slipping.
