My life is going very well lately. I am happy to be single, and happy to have my freedom, and happy to still be me after everything is said and done! I am a bit stressed out, but I only have 3 or 4 weeks of school left, and I have some loose ends to tie up. I'm looking forward to leaving, but I'm not. Beginnings are scary, endings are sad, and the middle is what counts. And although my middle wasn't exactly how I would've written it, I have learned a lot and I wouldn't take any of it back. But I definitely wouldn't do it over again! I'm glad to be in the place that I am now, and I wouldn't want to have to suffer again to get to this point! Breaking up with my ex was the best thing I could've ever done. I am seeing that now. If we never talk again, so what? What kind of person was he to cheat and cheat over and over again? What kind of love is that? That isn't a relationship! That's dependence, and I'm too smart to believe a mirage. I am so free and happy right now, and I love being myself and single and making my own choices, not based on what anyone else wants or strongly believes. And I know that I will find someone who loves me for me, and won't try to change me or clip my wings. I have learned that the wings of an eagle cannot be held back forever! I am so happy right now! My friendships are wonderful, and I have gotten rid of the people who just bring my life down. What a great feeling to have everyone I love in my life (as much as possible, anyway!)! And I am no one else's girl but my own! My family is good, of course, but I really don't see them enough. School is fine, and I'm enjoying life. Can you tell? I suppose I'll stop here. But to each of you who are doubting yourself, maybe you need to do a little cleaning house of the soul and the external influences that may be bringing you down...I did!
