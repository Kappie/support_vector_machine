We first stopped at Burger King so that we didn't starve though of course. I got a grilled chicken sandwich, and I must say, yummy. It sure did hit the spot. So, after about an hour of a drive, we end up at the lake.   Since we now have our Bonneville, it can't handle the sand, so we had to park on top of a hill and wait for Kerry to come get us in the truck.  After getting down to the camper, and unloading all of our stuff into the tent (kids get the tent, adults get the camper. Go figure.), we go on a boat ride. You have to wade out waist deep to get to the boat, and when the water temp. has to be about 55 degrees, it doesn't make you a happy camper. Especially when you are wearing denim shorts.  Anyhoo, we go for a short ride, then decide to head back. We get back, and put on our pants and sweatshirts.   There was this HUGE swarm of mosquitos outside of the camper, and you could hear them buzzing from the boat, that's how big of a swarm it was.  After throwing sand at them, which by the way didn't work, we get desperate and start taking out lighters. Now that was just fun. I can't tell you the joy I go just from hearing the little "BBZZZT" as the flame hit those little blood-suckers.  Then Brook  Jenna showed up, which was awesome, gotta hang with them for a little while.   Then I decided to hit the sack, and Joel and Jared decide to at the exact same time. I can't get to sleep because Joel is finding it hilarious to flicker the lights and sing the Twilight Zone theme song.  But sleep finally finds me. And with that, I then wake up in the middle of the night feeling pressure on my feet. Come to find out, Jared has totally flipped and has his head on my feet. I make him come get back in the right position, and he's whining because it's cold.  Well, I wonder why, when you have totally unzipped your sleeping bag, and you're laying on the cold sand!!! But I fix his sleeping bag, and the wind picks up. He's sitting there saying "I wanna go in the camper, I wanna go in the camper, I wanna go in the camper." So, as the good big sister, I respond "Do you want me to take you in the camper?" and he says "No." Well, can't say I didn't try. He finally falls asleep after I have to pat his back for about the past hour.  Sleep finds me once again.  Next morning, I wake up at the butt crack of dawn, look over at Jared and realize that I zipped his sleeping bag up inside out. He didn't seem to mind though.  I then go into the camper to find my mom cleaning the kitchen. Don't ask me why, my mother has OCD, it's a passtime for her. I'm not kidding, she really does have it, and it really is a passtime.  Anyway, I choke down a cake donut fast, and then we head up to the Lodge to fill the water bottles and get some sunflower seeds.  We go back down to the camper and find Kerry starting to cook breakfast. Breakfast burritos are oohhhhhhhhhhh so good.   Then we just to the normal routine of the lake. Eat breakfast, get cleaned up, sit outside catching some sun, listening to my mp3 player, do a couple word searches, and just wait for B to get up. After a little while, (it's now 2 pm), we go for a boat ride. We cruise around, and drift for awhile, increasing my sunburn. We then go pick up my other cousins that show up, and again cruise around and drift.  '  At about 4, it's starting to get really dark in the west, and the wind starts blowing, etc. We head back, and I go into Brook  Jenna's camper, and April (other cuz) goes with me. It's just us girls in there, when the wind starts to blow really hard and then it starts to rain and hail. We wait for awhile then just go back from camper to camper, playing poker. It's about 6:30, my other cousins have left since they live in the town right outside of the lake.  They invited us back to their house since the storm is so bad and hasn't let up, and doesn't look like its going to. Joel goes to inspect the tent, and finds it soaked, along with our clothes, covered in sand. We decide to haul all of our stuff into the camper, so we can take it up to the car, because we figure if the tent is soaked, it's best we just go home. So we take all the stuff out, and then guess what happens next.  Our tent starts blowing away.  Kerry sits there and says, "well, you better go catch it." That did not put him on my good side. So, it'd raining, and windy as all hell, and we are outside, chasing down our tent and taking it down at the same time. We throw it in the back of the truck, and throw all of our crap on it to keep it from blowing away.  Kerry takes us up to the Bonneville, where we load up our stuff and head in to Lisa's (my aunt, the one that lives nearby).    We get there and she's making us some food, so I head downstairs to hang with my cousin's, who have just started a movie, which I must say, was very very good (and the movie was Honey, I know it bombed, but I liked it!) .  We get to eat then, and that stuff was so good. I can't remember what it was called, let alone how to pronounce it, but it was sooo good. It was these curly noodles in marinara sause, with peperoni and sausage, and covered in cheese. Soooo yummy. With garlic bread and Coke. So, so good. And then we had brownies and ice cream for dessert. I was in heaven.  Gotta watch the rest of the movie, and part of an episode of The Inferno.  We played a few games, before we had to leave. We left at about 10:15 or so, and then Joel starts feeling sick. But he didn't ralph, which was a good thing.  We get home, and clean up all the crap from the car, take a shower, and I'm in bed by 12:30.   And now I'm just hanging out at home, cleaned out my car already today, and now I'm tired of typing. This has got to be my biggest entry ever. It's not like anyone even reads this, but if someone does, this will keep them busy.
