I'm reading Mists of Avalon (YES-ALYSSA!!!!) and, probably hence of my dad coming home and walking into the kitchen where my mom and me were, but god. Just this horrible feeling swept over me, and ugg. I NEVER want to be married to- a man. I dont know what it is, but i would die if my husband turned out to be this dominating MAN, who thought he could order me around, and expected me to cook his dinner and clean up, and do all the chores, and have his house all in order for him. It makes me sick just thinking of it. but a waves of terror crashed over me and i refuse to live a life like that. not even close. To be trapped in something so superficial and momentary!! I never want to be in that position. I will work, i will comes home when he does. Be as tired as him. But hell if i can't be the one to throw him on the bed; where has all the passion gone? he better be able to cook, too! Men think they can "settle" down with a nice meek wife. ARGH!!! this is not the fucking 50's! and  YOU  DO NOT DOMINATE! Men piss me off so bad sometimes!!! Just the attitude some of you think you have to right to hold!! What about us?!  And ya sure, "studies show more and more women are taking jobs and being independent rather than be the house wife/ stay at home mom," Oh bullshit. This is still a man's world. I hate it that they look at us. No not look- gawk! Show a little respect! i know that the world isn't going to change in a snap of the fingers. sigh. i just dont want to ever be trapped. is there such a person that i could hope for? Someone that you can be so free with, you dont have to feel confined. Thats something else, get to  know  him before you think about anything. ppl have hidden depths. god- what's even the point anymore?...
