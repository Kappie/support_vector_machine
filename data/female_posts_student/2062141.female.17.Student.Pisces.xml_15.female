(-Waiting for my Rocket to Come)    Hm.. well let's see  Who Needs Shelter Jason Mraz   Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite star Follow you I will so lets get moving  Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone.  By your clock the cock rooster crows Then off to work where everybody goes  Slow, But eventually they get there Picking up the day shift back where all left off Confined and pecking at relationships  You know it's only a worthless piece of shit  Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone.  I'd sleep it all away but the sun wont let me I'd miss those lovely days of summer  Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite.   *****  Less than ONE month til his concert. I'm getting backstage. Me and Char made a pact: it's either get backstage or literally be thrown out by bouncers. It'll be great either way.
