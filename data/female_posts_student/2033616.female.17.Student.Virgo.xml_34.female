Today... okay so it wasn't quite as fun.. except for Kyle Davis being the scum of the earth.. that was kinda funny.  It's been a REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY Bad day, but it was sorta resurrected by my hug before 7th period and the wonderful invention called the telephone... yippie for bestest buddies.  Wow still in a weird mood... still in a not so good mood.. i'm exauhsted... i think i'll go to bed, ha! ingenious!!!
