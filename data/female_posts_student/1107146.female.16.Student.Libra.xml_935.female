Rosie...You don't want to know him...If you think your mom hates Gunther...nevermind...Jackie  Bryan- You're wedding is already on my calandar.  I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm so excited!!!  But Bryan, you better take care of her!  Z and Becca, hurry up and get on this thing.  Josh, I'm sorry about Leigh.  I'm not saying anything else about that though.  And I know all of you guys don't know each other, but at least you're not rivals like on Josh's blog.  Maybe if I can get Josh, Rosie, etc. to church or Jackie to visit BHS, it'll work out.  Speaking of, Jackie, you're out of school now, you better come visit me, girl.  Oh, and for all the guys out there, if you call, be ready to give me your middle name.  Ryan keeps trying to call like he did about an hour ago pretending to be Josh (sorry, Josh, not quite sure how he knows I know you) and so I've been kinda filtering the calls.  God, I want life to go back to how it was like three weeks ago.  Life without Ryan is SOOOO much better than trying to avoid all his shit.  Yall have to remind me of that.  And let's try to keep his name off this blog as much as possible (though I'll probably be the one to break that one) We'll deal with my other problems, and trust me, there are enough of them.  Love you guys.  Thanks for listening to me.  I should be at school tomorrow if I can convince my mom I'm better.  I really don't feel better, but I HATE make-up work with a passion.  See yall later.
