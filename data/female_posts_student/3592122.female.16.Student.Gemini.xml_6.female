He drove to the shopping center and ran to the toy shop and asked the manager: "How much is that new Barbie in the window?"   The manager replied:  Which one? We have:  Barbie goes to the gym for 19.95  Barbie goes to the ball for 19.95  Barbie goes shopping for 19.95  Barbie goes to the beach for 19.95  Barbie goes to the nightclub for 19.95n and  Divorced Barbie for $375.00  "Why is the Divorced Barbie $375.00, when all the others are $19.95?" the dad asked. "Divorced Barbie comes withKen's car, Ken's house, Ken's boat, Ken's dog,Ken's cat and Ken's furniture..."))))
