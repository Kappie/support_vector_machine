I know nothing at all. All I can figure is that I am so far from knowing. Just plain  knowing --nothing in particular. Now I am just going to ramble on about everything right now, so bear with me.  Why do I only get used by people? Or at least have so many people trying to use me? One girl I know claims that I'm her best friend in the whole entire world but then all she does is vent to me about her guy problems and etc. One time she told me about how she was so upset that only 3/4 of the people she invited to her party were able to come. And I wasn't invited. Her "best friend in the whole entire world" wasn't invited. I was kind of upset so I told her, thinking maybe that she slipped up and forgot to invite me--and she said right to my face that she didn't want to.
