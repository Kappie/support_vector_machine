It really bother me since my dad was the same, and if any of you know anything about my dad, you'd agree that you really wouldn't want to be walking that path. It's interesting, true, but it sort of plays on my angel/devil complex at the same time. Yes, even I can have a sensitive spot towards formerly innocent girls whom I have turned to sex by any means.  Jeezus, makes it a lot worse thinking of it that way.  O wow.
