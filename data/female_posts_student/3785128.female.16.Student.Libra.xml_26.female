GREAT MOVIE. we tried to watch west side story but we were tired and it was too easy to make fun of. we got up around 10 and went to the craft fair. there is a lot of junk there. we spent like a half hour maybe just wandering. then we walked over to her house and played harry potter. yes harry potter. it was fun. i liked it. we went to scoops to get ice cream then she took me home. my mom took me to kohls later. i got a sweet new pair of jeans that came with a belt and then i got another belt. the belt i bought is a hologram belt. like its all these pictures of public places like street signs and buildings then you move it and the picture changes to all this graffitie. it was 6.99 down from 16.00. i was pleased with my great deal. then when i got back i went on ebay. im bidding on this sweet beatles jacket. its silver and blue. i love it. im finding all this stuff i love. ties, belt buckle, tshirts. i dont understand the belt buckle thing. can you buy a belt that you can put the buckle on? my mum said i could but where do i find such belts? o well this is getting long. ill talk about the beatles another day.
