Seems like I've lost my will to slog through it.   Another gray day today, but at least it's Friday.  I talked to Justin last night, a guy I dated briefly after my divorce.  "Good on paper," he was.  Good looking, successfully employed as some kind of executive who wears a suit, a degree in industrial engineering, knows how to play the guitar.  And he wasn't even a jerk.  He's still not a jerk, even after I strung him along and dumped him.  I feel stupid for not being able to have feelings for him, but what can I do?  I tried.  At least we're still friends. The thing is, I like boys who are bad for me.  My first date here in Lawrence was at the Salvation Army free meal cafeteria, not too long after I moved here.  I ate plain lettuce and powdered mashed potatoes next to old guys with liver lips and fleas, all the while making eyes at the scrawny little bad boy across from me.  I liked tramping around with him, smoking cigarettes under the bridge and drinking cheap wine on my porch.  I liked the feeling that we were kind of operating under the radar of the normal and the mainstream, like Sid and Nancy.  The only problem was that he was kind of dumb.  Half the time he had no idea what I was talking about. The next couple of boyfrieds were pretty bad, too.  Guys with warrants, bad credit, no cars.  Guys who, in their middle twenties, saw nothing wrong with traipsing around town in the small hours of the morning, tripping acid with an eighteen year old girl.  Now that I'm 23, these guys seem even more absurd.  God knows what became of them.  I saw one working as a host at a restaurant downtown, bald as an egg and fat now. The Big Love of my life, the one who became my husband...He was more together than all the rest of them combined, but I'd venture to say he was the worst.  Broke me into little bitty pieces, and this was after he hammered out all my dents and left me wondering who the fuck I was.  I feel better now, and I can pretty much say I'm glad to be alone for once.   I used to get so lonesome when I was free, but now it suits me just fine.
