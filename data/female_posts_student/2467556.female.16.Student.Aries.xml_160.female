Alright so for those of you i forgot to tell, i've been at church camp for 5 days. Terribly sorry that i didn't make it known, lol. It was sooooo awesome! Naturally, everyone had very little sleep so we were delirious the entire week. So i'm just going to list out some things that were jokes etc, sorry if you don't understand them:   * 5am wakeup call to Sarah and Nadia  * Date reenactments (Kendra is Mary and Mary plays the poor sap on the date lol)  * Me: Neurotic....means like you come out at night...   Mary: lol thats nocturnal!  * Wal-Mart run because i forgot my underwear...."these people are looking at you weird because y'all are acting like you've never been in a walmart before"  * Me: *squeezes sanitizer into hand* man that stuff really just comes out doesn't it?.....wait that sounds so wrong  * Carmen: boys suck and period suck (something like that)  me: Boyfriends are like periods......you go through alot of pain and suffering with one, just like a period, then you dismiss the egg, just like you dump a boyfriend and then you get a new boyfriend just like you get a new egg after your period!  Carmen: somehow....that makes perfect sense  * uuuh de nah nah nah  * "thank god i brought this! *throws plastic bag*  * *kendra hides mercer's spongebob* "c'mon, ive already lost my underwear! where's my spongebob!??"  * Nadia: what that cheer we like to hear.....   Mr. casey: get your stuff out of my car  * "mary is like my dog" - kendra  * " i have to pee like a pee machine" - sarah  * sacrifice to the sink god!  * Sarah: What is this? a 24 hour day!?!?!   Kristen: everyday is 24 hrs....  * "getting a hug from jake ross is like getting a mamagram!" (haha we love you jake!)  * Troy: hey mercer whats up?   me: nothing much   T: *points to elbow* you know what this is?   me: an elbow?   T: a weenus!   me: *gives weird look* i dunno about you, but where i come from, weenus has a slightly different connotation than what you're using it for...   Clint: wow thats a great pick up line Troy, "Yo girl check out my weenus!"  * Newsflash! Matt Miller doesn't wear a bra!  * Lesbian enchanted  * Sarah: im a 13 year old boy in 16 year old girl's body   Mary: i believe it!  * *sarah kisses fanta bottle* Kristen: c'mon Sarah, matt miller is bigger than than that........wait! i did not mean it dirty!  * the Matt Miller Diary entry  * the name of the air conditioning unit lol  * me: crap i lost my earring....the end of an era   nadia: oh no! oh well   me: *few hours later, i find the earring* THE ERA LIVES ON!!!!   nadia: crap...  * official harry potter day (lol nadia)  * "i was like whoa! violation, he grabbed my ass"  * my only goal of the hockey game.....and how i was so happy that i chucked my stick across the field!  * Jason Craft and his stories....  * the cup of hockey (lol that cup that i made you hold nadia because i was in the zone lol)  * "I am not Lindsay Lohan!!!"  * "i'm not cute, i'm hardcore"  * "oh man he is sooo ripped" ~ nadia  * snuggle time!  * Jerry Seinfeld on the way home  * "Wait....so you drive a tractor?" ~ Shaminee  * Megan: Lets play the penis game!   me: how about not!  * the Destiny's child dance that i can do that Sarah turned into a broadway show  * *bumps into wall at 5am* OH CHRIST!!! *wakes up everyone on floor*  * "uuuh considering he's like 20, thats really obnoxious"  * "if i changed my name and package, i could be Taylor Kubic ~ me (lol nadia)   hmmm....i'm sure there's more but i dunno, i'll remember later!   After we got back from camp and my mom finally picked me and mary up, me and mary hopped in my tracker and went to local diner. it was deliciously artery clogging!   Now i have to prepare myself to go Vivian's wedding tomorrow! It turns out that i don't get to have my hair done because my mom forgot to make an appointment. Yet she remembered to make me a nail appointment, so now i get to suffocate in the nail shop tomorrow morning with all the frickin fumes. oh joy. i still have to get shoes for this thing, who knows if we'll get to that. Oh well, i 've decided that i'm going to break it down at the reception tomorrow. My body will be "gyrating" (lol nadia).   i'm out, i gotta write a letter to stewie.   Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
