I have to work hard in school in order to get these things. I'm gonna meet an older guy in college and go out with him. He's a millionare and is very well known. Then I end up marrying him. I'm gonna end up going far away and then come back. We have two children, a boy and a girl, who will grow up to be very good. I'm gonna take care of my entire family. I'm gonna have a lot of friends cause everyone likes me and cause I'm nice. I'm going to live a long and happy life.  That's what my brother told me. I ended up getting a king card twice, and the 7 card twice...That always means something....
