He's 2 months, 2 weeks old and is a grey and white tabby.  He is SO cute!  His name, when we went to look at him, was Dusty.  When we adopted him we named him Galileo.  It fits him perfectly.  I know, I know, your thinking that Galileo is an awfuly big name for such a small critter, but he's the most curious little guy.  He also jumps all over the place, jumping, jumping, jumping!  Jumping toward heaven, toward the stars, so Galileo is a perfect name.  We fell in love with him from the first moment we saw him.  He was the one, a perfect little brother for Chummer.  We were slightly worried that Chummer would take badly to haveing another cat in the house, but Chummer seems to really like it.  He hasn't even hissed at the little one.  They play and have a good time.  It's really very adorable.  We decided to get him now because we are moving in two weeks.  We didn't want to introduce a new environment and a new pet into chummers life.  Luckily, Chummer is taking to Galileo really well.  Thanks all that's holy!  Kristyn
