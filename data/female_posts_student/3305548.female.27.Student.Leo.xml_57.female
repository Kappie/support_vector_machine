Go have the experience of the outdoor movie viewed from your car. It’s not to be missed.  Last night we went to see a double drive in feature of VanHelsing and Connie and Carla. Sitting through the first one was worth it to see the second one. VanHelsing was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I don’t mean that in a complimentary fashion. It seemed like it couldn’t go wrong: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, a monster hunter, cool gadgets, lots of monsters, and a vampiric bad guy. How could this movie have failed? In this day and age, with the special effects that abound…it seemed that it would rake in kudos in acting, effects, and whatnot. What went wrong?   I would have to say that the director, Stephen Sommers, is to blame. In my mind this was a career ending movie for him. Jackman and Beckinsale have proved themselves as actors of skill and capable of handling the genre (Beckinsale played a vampire who hunts other vampires in Underworld quite recently and Jackman is quite well known for playing Wolverine – which isn’t too far a step from a werewolf and certainly has the drive for hunting down the bad guys.) So we can’t blame the actors. They did all they could.   The special effects were seamless enough. No cheesy moments, good CPU animation work, and it was uniform in style and theme. The costuming can get a bit of abuse it was obvious that being completely anachronistic and a hinderance to the purpose of the characters at times was not considered. Have you ever seen a non-anime vampire hunter with hair in his/her face? Not if they want to stay alive. Plus, women of that time period didn’t wear their hair down – if but rarely. Certainly not on an ordinary day in their life. And often if it was down…it was half up, with combs or baubles of some sort. Yeah, so I am picking a fight with the hair designer in the costuming department. Still, even bad hair cannot truly sink a movie…if it could Harry Potter’s Malfoy would have sunk the whole enterprise of Potter flicks.   Why was VenHelsing so bad? This is still up for debate. There were some rough edits and cuts…some rocky transitions…but all in all superior to the Harry Potter 3 transitions. The editor cant be blamed for VanHelsing. Aha! The script? Yes, the script is in part to blame. It was anachronistic in word choice, jilted, and poorly cut and edited. Some lines that were said back to back by one character had absolutely nothing to do with each other. Beyond that, exposition came a across as exposition, the characters were written in a fairly one dimensional manner, and there was little complexity to the characters at all. It would be fair to say that Frankenstein’s monster was the most complex character on screen, and somehow the only one I really cared about. It’s saying something that when one of the main characters dies at the end…I didn’t really care.  So the script carries some of the weight of failure. But wait! Who wrote it??? The director, Stephen Sommers, is to blame for this as well. Aha! So he gets one count of extreme script dereliction against him. While the image of artistic unity of the movie was preserved (a main job of a director) it seemed that the vision of plot and structure was clouded and incomplete. The concepts and ideas were “almost there” to that critical moment of solidity, but efforts to improve the concepts were abandoned too soon.   The whole underground Catholic Church theme was not delved into deep enough. The audience is left wondering why there seems to be a James Bond style medieval lab with Q as a monk. The whole left hand of god reference is also baffling. What is the significance of this? What is the point or meaning? We never really learn. It also begs the question: “Then just where is God's right hand?”  We understand that the history of the main gypsy family is a long one, with much strife and attempts to kill Drakula - but we don’t really know why, and we aren’t curious in the least. Some vague connections and references are made, but the audience just isn’t given enough bait to get involved with the mystery. Some flashbacks to previous generations would have been of some use.   Oh, and as far as VanHelsing’s forgotten memory and identity – this is also skimmed. Not enough information is given so as to actually interest the audience. When his history is finally revealed, we had all but forgotten about the point of it. One more big plot gripe – random and occasional anachronisms. I love gadgets – don’t get me wrong. And anachronistic gadgets can work if completely imbedded with detail and concept in the story. For example, the recent version of  Sleep Hollow featured lots of gadgets employed by Johnny Depp’s character – and they were anachronistic but they worked in the story. These gadgets, as used by Hugh Jackman’s character, just stood out and did not meld well with the story. The Vampire’s gadgets and electricity fit more precisely and were more understood. The bit of background on Dr. Frankenstein did all the filling in needed for the audience to accept the super charged electrical invention…although the networking of the hatchery was a little fishy.  Stephen Sommers gets two slaps to the wrist for not directing his actors to fill out his vision. The friar is off in his own little world of landing the most irrelevant actions and getting caught up in his funny voice instead of delivering his lines well. Frankenstein’s monster seems to have gotten the vocal chords of a dead opera singer – for he proclaimed most of his lines in a singing ariatic format. (Without seeming to do so intentionally or with purpose.) Also, I do have to say that Ms. Beckinsale came off sounding more like a vampire than Drakula himself. Whether that is because she is more talented with accents and Drakula was lacking or because she was overdoing it…you be the judge. My guess is that they didn’t hire any accent coaches and that the actors learned on their own from tapes and whatnot. The priest from the beginning of the movie sounds like Super Holy Mario more than actually sounding Italian.   Lastly and certainly not least in my crucifixion of the end of Stephen Sommer’s Hollywood career is an almost unforgivable movie sin. Microphones show themselves in at least 5 scenes or shots. These offending amplifiers can be seen hanging over the actors heads in scenes starting with the scene featuring the gypsy princess, VanHelsing, and Frankenstein’s monster in the bottom of the burnt out ruins of the windmill. They show up there somewhat consistently for more than five minutes. It looks like the bottom of a song and dance cane over their heads – it’s a Boom Mic. Then again the microphones invade in some later scenes in the woods. We see the whole top of a microphone once again over their heads.   This is an amateur movie-maker error. It’s beyond reproach why no one caught it, cut it, or re-shot it. The director totally carries the blame for that one. Did Mr. Sommers not ever watch the final version of his movie? This is the legitimate stage equivalent to having your stage manager walk out on stage to hand someone a prop, or leaving a scrim half in or out. No one should see the technical magic of the show or entertainment. It should be a mystery and hidden from the audience. We know there is a camera, microphones, costumes, props, and makeup. We don’t want to see the reality behind the escape unless it’s a documentary or a making-of special. Bad Director – no career for you!  In the end: VanHelsing  The Good: Special effects, creature transformations, and casting. It should have been a great movie!  The Bad: See above 6 paragraph rant. Some other notes: time is not handled well in the movie. A full moon only lasts 2 or 3 nights…and they are a month apart. There is something wonky in the timing thereof. Once again, someone spent too much time on the closing credits and not enough time on the movie, and what’s up with the sudden Drakula castle weather change - from snow to downpour of rain and lightening with no imbetween.  The Ugly: The image of the end of one man’s Hollywood career. RIP Stephen Sommers.  All in all: Don’t see this unless you are being paid a lot to do so, or if you want to write a paper in Film School of what not to do, or unless you made up a drinking game of some kind to go along with this cinema disaster.  Harsh I know. It deserved it. Bubba Ho-Tep was a better movie. Now that’s saying something.  Onto the enjoyable part of the evening!   Connie and Carla: starring Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and Toni Collette (Muriel’s Wedding.) The concept is two dinner theatre performers who haven’t yet seen success witness a mob hit and have to hit the road. They decide to go to a place “without any culture whatsoever” so they go to LA. Once there they audition for a night club and get jobs performing as Drag queens. That’s right they are women, pretending to be men, dressed as women. Puts “Some Like it Hot” to shame – although it is regrettable that they didn’t reference the Marilyn Monroe flick in the slightest.   The Good: Great performances by Vardalos and Collette. Amazing comedic timing and great singing voices to boot. Gay men were prevalent in the movie but to the best of my discernment were not relegated to stereotypes…other than enjoying musical theatre of course. David Duchovy put in a great effort as the uptight straight guy who is trying to get to know his brother (a drag queen) for the first time in 16 years or so. The characters were over the top enough to be funny and still stay real. At least that’s my opinion. The drag queens in the movie did great work and it makes me wonder which ones are drag queens full time. The explanation of where the term drag comes from is quite handy too.   It was quite enjoyable to watch Vardalos and Duchovy work very hard on not seeming to be involved in a dating ritual. He being straight and thinking Nia’s character is a man…she being straight and being a woman. It was quite entertaining and an interesting commentary on the friendships embarked upon between members of the straight and gay community. Loved Debbie Reynolds. Loved the stand up comedy moments.   The Bad: The “Your voice is giving me (name your disease here)” jokes got way old and way obviously placed toward the middle and to the end of the movie. There is one of these in particular that just sticks out completely from the action. There are a few painfully cheesy moments…but the audience does seem to want to go along with it.   The closing number gave me pause however. In the final number in the movie Connie and Carla are "out" as women and no longer in drag, but the drag queens that share their act with them are not in drag either. The former queens are dressed as men – men with a lot of eye makeup, but men nonetheless. It just didn’t seem right to me. It was like the message of the scene was “Now that there are ‘real’ women onstage we can have no queens" – the men are now relegated to dressing as men.  One of the points of the theme of the movie that made this movie quite solid is that drag queens dress as they feel inside, so what does that say about the closing number? Are they being oppressed by sharing the stage with the image of “real women”?   I was also slightly disappointed in some of the song choices for the movie…but I suppose they had to hit the dinner theatre/gay community classics. Oh, and the ending again -not that it’s bad in the wrap up, or didnt fit or anything, but it seems to me that Connie and Carla outing themselves as women to their theatre audience and friends wouldn’t have gone so smoothly. The character of the woman at the spa saves the scene and saves Connie and Carla…but it seems a little far fetched. I guess I would have brought the resolution about a little slower if I was making the directorial choices.  The Ugly: Ack some of the wigs. Though I suppose that the wigging needed to be semi artificial…but still! The portrayal of  Mary – David Duchovy’s girlfriend – was a little harsh and one sided. Not that I wanted her and David to stay together (thereby robbing Vardalos’ character of her romantic interest) but I did want to see her apologize for her ignorance and hurtful words. David did it…and did it well…but it seems the message here is that some people are closed minded and will stay that way – rather than putting down roots toward universal acceptance.   Bonus: The Russian thug hit man who transforms into a musical theatre fanatic is quite entertaining. Seeing this with theatre people, or gay friends would be waaaay fun, and probably involve some singing along to boot.  Overall: Not as stellar as Vardalo’s cinematic debut…but that would be a hard act to follow. Very enjoyable and fun movie in which Toni Collette really shines. I am curious to see what members of the gay community and drag community had to say about the flick – if it had a wildly popular underground/gay culture following. I wouldn’t know sitting in Podunk West Virginia. Definitely rent it/watch it/catch it in a second run theatre or something. It’s a fun, melodic, feel good, comedy with a semi-unique plot and a definite new twist on cross dressing in the movies.  Wow…what long reviews today. I should apologize for my verbosity.  I also took some pictures of the Jungle Drive In Movie Theatre…and will post those later.   On a different note altogether: President Ronald Reagan has kicked the bucket.  I have read nothing but nice little articles saying what great efforts he put into ending the Cold War, and how he revolutionized the Republican party, and had the all-time to-date highest approval rating... blah blah blah.  I hate how people get idealized in their passing. It seems that there is a rule that say that people must say only nice things (in public) about someone right after they die. Not out of disrespect to a man I didnt know, but I think its more important that people and the media are sincere.   Reagan was a man that had little qualification for public office other than fame. A man who sold the arms to Iran and Iraq and even Afghanistan that have been used against the US in many ways since then. A President who got the country into the largest debt in history (although GW Bush might out do him if given another four years..) A man who I never heard a nice thing said about not even once when I was growing up. A man who shunned his gay son, repressed AIDS education as much as possible, and contributed beyond any other president to nuclear proliferation. Yeah. Him.   The character of Alex Keaton from Family Ties (played by Michael J. Fox) idolized him. I think with Reagan’s death so goes Alex Keaton. The character itself will have no purpose.   Reagan - who could have spoken out sooner as being pro-stem cell research to save his own life - if he wasn’t so concerned with his conservative image.   Does no one remember Reaganomics? The trickle down economy theories?   Why do people seem to publicly forget the errors of a person when they cease to breathe? I know this isn’t truly the case - that people hold grudges way beyond the grave and that with the passing of some the world sighs a collectively in relief.  So why the positive spin of PR? Out of honor or respect? How is it respectful to paint everything rosy and gloss the truth? Or perhaps that is the media’s biggest Reagan Eulogy ever - remembering his presidency in the hidden factual, half information, “I do not recall,” ignore the problem, trickle down truth manner in which he lead our country for 8 years. The media is honoring Reagan by reverting into Reaganites. Somehow that seems appropo and quite scary all at once.   Side Note: I find it quite disturbing that the body of Reagan will be flying (with a return trip) coast to coast for his honorings. Imagine having a dead president in a coffin in the cargo bay below your seat on an airplane. Beyond eerie.  In closing salute: The man who put Bonzo to bed had gone to his final resting place as well. The judgement of whoever he believed his maker to be, will be the final one. Whatever spiritual faith he had will guide him where he deserves to go. Reagan (like anyone else) is not really for any other human to judge – but I do think we should remember him accurately. Idealizing a President has gotten this country into a lot of trouble in the past three years, and it certainly wont help Reagan now.  All the news in long-ass fits of print... Mack
