The waiting, however, is brutal - 2-3 weeks before I get any results! >. According to my class instructors, both Medical City and Children's Hospital should be hiring soon, so with any luck I'll have a hospital/ER job within the next few months.  I can't wait to get started!  At this point, any job other than my current (cashier at a cafe) would be a blessing, but I can't complain too much.  It's ok, and the bills are getting paid.  Summer session is almost over - even though it just started.  Chem 2 has been treating me nicely... at this point, my A is almost assured.  Best not to get   too   cocky, tho... I can't afford to get a B in a class like Gen Chem 2.  I've got much harder classes in the next few semesters and precious little room for anything less than straight As (if I plan on getting into a good med school, that is).   Well, that's it for now - more updates when I have more at least semi-important news to share.  ^^
