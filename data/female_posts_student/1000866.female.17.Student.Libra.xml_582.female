OK...so, it was more like two or three days but still, it seemed like a week. I just ended up leaving him a note in his locker with a drawing of what I was going to do. Haha. Fun times, fun times. So really, that's what's been going on these past few days. Plans for coming up with an inventive way to ask him and then....the plans just.....ending up not working. My new classes are great too. I really think I'm going to like psych but I'm so tired right now so...more tomorrow maybe.
