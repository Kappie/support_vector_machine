Looked like an idiot with a grin on my face.. And I bought Conduct Zero vcd too.. The show we watched together on our first date.. His mom cooks really divine fried rice... With sprinkled bacon bits on top.. Sinful but nice.... yum yum.. Wish I can cook like her...  K.. gonna watch more tv now..nite!   Love is not blind - it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to see less. Rabbi Julius Gordon
