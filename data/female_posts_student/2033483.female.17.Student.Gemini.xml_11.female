I'm sick of eating out!  I'm really going to start and be more positive in my blog.  I'm always complaining and that's not how I normally am, but their is something about typing my day out that makes me remember the annoying things that happened to me.    My mom and I went shopping this afternoon and she bought me some new clothes at Aeropostale and I got this really cool reversible shirt at Yonkers.  Thanks, Mom!  Church was fun.  The Quissels' sat next to us tonight so that was nice, sitting next to someone you actually know.  Plus, the "cruton o' Christ' was yummy! hehehe!  Anyway...Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord!  Fun song that has entertaining hand gestures.  If you want I can demonstrate them for you sometime and you can laugh at them b/c they are really quite funny.    I finished my Lab Report (round of applause!)  Tomorrow morning I have a dentist appointment at 9 and an orthodontist appointment at 1.  I wonder when my braces are coming off.  Every time I go they say "oh, Kayla, you're so close"  I just want to tell them to either shut up or take them off!  My appointments are only two weeks apart now so maybe they are right.  Cross your fingers!    tata
