Jill gets hyper when she doesn't eat. The way there consisted of Jill singing, saying "Arbys Arbys Arbys Arbys...etc" (we were meeting Sarah and Melanie there to eat) and "Dodo, lobster, tucan!!" over and over and over again. That was nightmaric.    When we got there we ate, signed Nick's belated birthday card and talked about how excited we were. After eating my friends deserted me and went in the car with my mom leaving me alone with my dad. (I like driving places with my dad, I just felt... left out)   At the church we discovered that Slingshot 57 wasn't back from eating yet. So we waited, giggled and Melanie hyperventilated while giggling. Once they got there it was fun. We saw Ben first, then Paul... this was fun for Melanie. She  had  to get a picture. Two in fact. The first one he knew about, the second surprised him. We giggled everytime someone said something or someone took a picture... we were absolutely insane. Here we are before the concert and before we saw any of the guys.      At first everytime Nash walked by Sarah kept saying "There goes your future husband!" And Jill got on my nerves with stuff like that too. I'm too shy to do anything special right now. Once I get used to seeing them more often, the more open I'll be to showing my... better side. Oh well. It might be better at the next concert.    Exciting news for me. My youth minister is working on getting Slingshot 57 to play at our church! Woo-hoo! If they play at our church... I'll definitely feel way more comfortable. Now, back to the story   The concert was wonderful. So much fun. Afterwards we were surprised at how many people didn't really hang around them... It was kind of like we were stalkers because we followed them around. We got wonderful pictures. We're all going to be sharing with each other. Definitely. Melanie got "butt pictures" after the show was over and they were loading up stuff. That was so funny. We don't think they even noticed!    Silly string is a wonderful thing. We silly stringed the van and wrote on the trailer. Melanie was the first to do damage to the van. She had the black can of silly string. It came out white at first, though. (thank goodness) She got the it all over the windshield. We were all giggling like crazy and they didn't even seem to care then either! They were right behind it at the trailer!!! Then once it got near the end of them packing, Sarah silly stringed Nash with the pink silly string. "Pink is a very masculine color." As Melanie stated.    The night came to a close with them coming out for the last time to see the damage we had done and for us to say goodbye to them. (Melanie and Kari went in to get them) They all started to get in and thought they were going to leave until they finally noticed the silly string on the windshield. Neill got out to get it off. (made me feel kinda bad even though I didn't spray it on there) And as they closed the doors and we all said goodbye we waved and Melanie once again silly stringed the van...    That night had many memories even after they left.. but, I'm too lazy to put them on here. That took long enough in itself. I might feel like writing about the after events later today though.
