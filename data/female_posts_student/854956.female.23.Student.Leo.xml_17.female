Ya know, I've been thinking of just finally saying something to "SI Mike" about going out sometime, because he seems interested but isn't making any moves on his own.  So, I was going to say something to him today.  He ALWAYS shows up early (around 30 minutes early).  But OF COURSE he picks today to show up late.  Not completely late to class, but later than normal, and with only like, a few minutes to spare.  And of course I couldn't ease into suggesting that he and I go hang out sometime with only 3-5 minutes.  *sigh*  Oh, well.  I guess I'll attempt bringing it up on Monday.  Despite my horrible luck with guys, I have managed to have GOOD luck with parking!  4/5 days this week I got a parking spot REALLY close.  It was so nice.  Especially to get a good spot today, cause I was afraid I'd be walking back to my car through the rain.  On a completely different note, I am no longer friends with someone I've been friends with for over 3 years.  Sad, isn't it?  I guess it's true.  Once you do sexual things with someone, and things don't work out for the two of you... it's near impossible to be close to them in any way.  Or maybe it's just that I've grown into a different person?  I don't THINK I've changed too much over the past 3 years, though.  I mean, I don't think my bestest friends would say I've changed.  Of course, they've most likely changed a bit, too.  So, I guess they wouldn't be too good a judge of change.  Cause we've probably all changed together.  Hmmm... well, I don't have much more to say right now.  I'll post some fun to read stuff next week about stuff around campus.  That's ALWAYS a crowd pleaser.  I can tell you all about the weird, freaky people on campus.  And oddly, I'm friends with a few of them.  They are UTSA's equivalent of the Courtyard Crows at Roosevelt.  :-)  Later!
