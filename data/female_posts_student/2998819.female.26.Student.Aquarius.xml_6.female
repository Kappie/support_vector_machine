I kept up with my brother for aprox 1.5 miles and then I ran my own pace trying to get my breathing pattern down.  When trying to work on my breathing I couldn't get enough air and my lungs became a little tight and my throat became super dry.  I did stop for about 20 seconds, but then I re-started and finished the last mile.  I am looking forward to today's run!  Weight: 176 BMI: 25.5
