(its not due till friday so it has less priority) and than in Psychology i couldn't be bothered doing my work so i didn't and in english i was able to escape the evil wrath of my teacher because i didn't have my oral ready to do because as i claimed my chosen article was to big to fit on one overhead so that is how my day has been, yours any more exciting? from Piggy
