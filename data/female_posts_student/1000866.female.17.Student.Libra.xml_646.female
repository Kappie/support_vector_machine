Then we helped Jim move his aunt's car into her garage. Well, actually, Stephen and Matthew did, not me. Anyway, after that we went to Stephens house for a bit more. then Matthew, Chris, and I all went to the park and we ALMOST got caught by a cop. It was so narrow. We left just as this cop was coming. Someone must've called him. No good. We weren't doing anything wrong. Just sitting and talking.   So, then Matthew went home and Chris and I drove around for a looong time. It was really nice just hanging out with him again. I missed him. Anyway, I realllly need sleep so, au revoir.
