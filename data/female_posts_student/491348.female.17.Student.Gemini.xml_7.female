Got out of the house, and I realised that I forgot to bring my mobile phone w/ me. I thought "shit," but ok.  When I got to New Malden, I discovered that I had forgotten my Admissions Ticket. This was really bad and I considered for a moment NOT taking the SATs at all, but then I figured I might be able to do something about it when I got there, so ok.  When I got to the American Community School in Esher, (took a taxi from Esher Train Station), I found that I didn't bring my calculator.  I was really pissed off, and I wondered why I was even taking the test.  Eventually I learned that even though I didn't have my admissions ticket, I could fill out a registry form and be a "stand-by" test-taker. I did that... but then after I handed the form in, I realised I had filled in the wrong test center number, and also my passport name. I registered online for the SAT using my english name, not my passport name...  What was even worse, I got so confused during the test when I was filling in my name on the Answer Sheet. I kept thinking to myself: passport name? english name? which one? And now that I think of it, I really can't remember which one I used. I think I used my English name.  Anyway, although I didn't have a calculator, I'm pretty sure I got all the math questions right. If nothing went wrong, I'll probably get full marks.  But the verbal section was sooooo horrible... I was guessing all the way through. I mean, yeah, maybe the first 5 questions of every section (anologies and shit) I could do, but the rest was just pure guessing. The reading passages part was pretty much ok, though. The sad thing is that I didn't finish the last verbal section because I had put my answer sheet on top of the question booklet, and I did not realise there were 5 more questions until the lady was like, "please put your pencils down." And I picked up my answer sheet and saw 5 more questions..... (and thought: FUCK!!!) I WAS wondering why there weren't any questions about both the passages!!!!  But oh well, what's done is done, nothing can change it. Bleh.  After the exam, I had to walk (an hour!) all the way back to Esher train station because there were so many people taking the SAT's, and all the taxis were booked. I was very pissed off, and I arrived in the library like... at 3:00pm. Can you imagine? Leaving the house at 6:30am, and coming back at 3:00pm just for an SAT exam.  And gee, I really can't wait until I take my SAT II subject tests! Haha.   Yeah... so I've been studying in the library the past few days, and... now I'm back at school. Half-term is officially over.  Tuesday is the official exam for AS Biology Module 1, 2, and 3. Then Music Aural, History and Analysis. Haha... 6 exams in one day. And I've got Math Pure 1 on Wednesday. Boy this is exciting.
