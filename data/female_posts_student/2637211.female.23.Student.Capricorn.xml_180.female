Okay, I'll email you or *gasp!* even call you. So I used to be able to write a 3-4 pager in like 2 hours, and my record for a 5-6 pager is about 5 hours... okay, did the math, not counting reading, I wrote it that fast. It doesn't really beat my old record: last year, spring quarter--the paper was due at 4:40, but first I had to go to section that morning at 10-11. I got off the bus, came inside and started writing, having only mildly skimmed the reading. But the best part is that I got and A- on it, and the TA totally used my paper as an example of how to write a well organized paper. I'm telling you, organization will get you by when you've fucked off on everything else. Really and truly. Either I'm a great writer, or my TAs are shmucks. And since I like all of my TAs (except for the ones who give me Bs) I'd like to thing that I'm a great writer. Makes me feel better about myself at the very least. Well, until I get the paper back!
