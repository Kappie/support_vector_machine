Riiight, I'm talking to myself again *sigh* comes to some thing when you start doing that.  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=880217  Every one say 'oh god not again, katie wrote a poem late at night and it's deep and meaningful' YEAY! Hehe, well actually I'm having a lot of trouble getting to sleep, I start off too cold and end up too hot! So I usually end up reading or writing but then I figure it's 12 and I have to be up at 8, that's always a bummer. Hey, I'm kind of going freaky on fanfiction, yeay I'm putting my weird Ant story on! (That should keep em running) :D Spread the freakiness people! (Even though I'm doing a good job by myself).
