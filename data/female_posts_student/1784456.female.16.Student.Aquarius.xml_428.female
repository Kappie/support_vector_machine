Never ever tell your enemy just before your about to kill them what you plan to do next. 2. Get  evil laugh sorted out, and hire a guy to follow you around with a black screen just incase he needs to put it behind you for evilness. 3. Get a cool evil base sorted out, but not some where odvious that has a big illuminous sign saying "evil person here" cause I've got that already. 4. Always have a good evil plan, and uh why am I doing this again? Guess I've been playing on Monkey Island too much! And hey, do you have to pay for kazaa? cause we aren't (hmm bro must of got a hack!) Hehe, well today was pretty mad, well ok, very mad! I think our 1 mile radious might of extended to 2 by now! I'm gonna go play on Monkey Island bubi! Download it off KaZaA!
