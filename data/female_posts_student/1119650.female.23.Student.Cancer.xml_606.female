To me, nothing *seems* wrong.  I'm very happy righ tnow, I love my friends, I love the situations I'm in right now (with the exception of my job, but even that is manageable).  For the last few days I've had this weird sense of impending panic.  I tried to be extra silly this week and kind of laugh it off, in hopes that I'd forget that I'm feeling nutty again.  Last nite I laid in bed, sweating and awake, I'd doze off feeling that maybe 3 or four hours had passed...It was only half an hour.  I've laid in my bed for days this week after I was done running with Billy just thinking and thinking not even about anything.  Not even about anything coherent or sensical.  Just wheels spinning constantly.  I feel like I'm losing my mind again and I'm scared.  This morning in the shower I had a panic attack.  I started to shake and become short of breath.  I thought I was freezing so I turned the water up as hot as it could go and as it came down, burning, I stood beneath it and shivered and tried to breathe.    I don't want to go back on my Paxil.  I don't need it.  I feel shitty all day today, my thoughts are scattered.  I'm physically here, mentally who knows.  I thought I was okay.
