My parents make sure we're there every Sunday.  I like that, and I'll do the same for my children someday.  The Church is a very important place that children need to be and learn from.  Allen was there...he was dressed very metro but cute nonetheless.  Something that baffles me about Catholics is that we only dress up on Christmas and Easter.  Some girls weren't dressed very appropriate I thought.  Skirts from Hollister and Abercrombie are not meant for church, if you know what I mean.  Another thing as long as I'm talking about things that bother me during church, is the parents that don't take their kids out when they start to cry.  It is so difficult to hear Father when their is a kid in front of you balling their eyes out.    Today ends this Lenten season and I am proud to say I made it through without one chocolate chip cookie.  I had one today, but it didn't taste as good as I thought it would.  I'm thinkin' lent solved my cookie addiction, so lent was a success in my mind.  And I must say that I am very proud of Renae for choosing to do Lent with me even though she isn't Catholic and getting through it without having Ramen noodles.  It means alot that she encouraged me by doing Lent with me.  The one thing that bothers me so much is when people that aren't catholic and some that are say they are going to have a big juicy steak on a Friday or say their going to eat something that I gave up.  It doesn't make me jealous at all it just makes me think that person is rude, inconsiderate, and immature.  So if you were one of those people learn from your mistake of this year and don't repeat it next year.    I hope the Easter Bunny visited your house and gave you something you wanted and not a rotten egg...Happy Easter  9 more days!  ~Kay
