I think that Will is in Georgia or someplace like that...I don't know, I think thats what Josh said in an earlier post.  Anyway, so, I've already done all the things I needed to do today, so I'm really bored now, but what else is new?  Linds, I called some hair places and there were two places that sounded pretty good; Heads Up and Ben's Salontique.  So, hopefully I can get my hair done sometime really really soon.  Man, I am not looking forward to this weekend.  2 days of people critiquing me is not what I find enjoyable.  My aunt is so judgemental.  She and I don't really get along because she is always telling me what I've done wrong and you guys know how I am.  I am NEVER wrong.  So, yeh, this should be fun.  At least my cousins will be there...not that they are much help, but they are still really cool.    Isn't "boy howdy" the funnest phrase to say?  You can use it to express pretty much any emotion and people laugh when you say it.  I love it and I think that goes for Josh too, from what I've heard.    Germs, my invisible dog.
