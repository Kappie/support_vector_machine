Don't do it again *cough* Alyce *cough*. 2)  No foul language unless completely justified.  If you don't think it is 93.2% neccesary, don't use it. 3)  Post at least once on here every 2 weeks or get a pay cut.  4) When I post my Ore Count post (every 6 hrs.) post on the comments with your total. If you do not post on at least one of the Ore Counts per day, our orders may go out late.  When orders go out late, everyone gets a pay cut (myself included.) To accomodate this pay cut, I will spend the 5% cut on coal for the next orders. Please post on here with something to say or ask about. Note: If there are no outstanding orders, the clan can mine coal for a certain member's order. In other words, if you want coal, and we aren't working, just post and it will be done, free of charge.
