Hes hawaiian. Its an amazingly beautiful song though. peaceful. and we know how i love my peace.  "and i think to myself, what a wonderful world..."  yeah, so...update. Friday i went to see 50 first dates. which didnt suck as bad as i thought it would. it was kinda cute. and adam sandler didnt make as big of an ass out of himself as he usually does, so it was good. and i went with kara and cait and martha. i originally wasnt going to do anything on friday, so...fun times.  saturday i went driving for an hour and a half finally. i havent had hardly any driving practice. im not as scared about driving now. because of that. and because i went driving with emily three times and we didnt crash and die and i felt pretty safe. anyway, after driving i went to micheles for pizza and...to my great surprise...emily was there...what the hell? why isnt she with eric? i know, i know... i thought that too. but eric was sick. too sick to go out with emily, i guess. they didnt do anything for valentines day! how sad is that? thats sad. poor emily. emily didnt care very much though...because apparently she dislikes valentines day for whatever reason. so it was just any other day to her and she was indifferent about not being showered with romantic gifts or anything. so shes weird. whatever. it was great though, because i got surprise emily! which i never get. its amazing. and then we went to see "Morning Star" at school and it was incredibly good! James and Kim were especially good! Amazing! those kids have crazy talent. i think it was better than "you cant take it with you"...although "you cant take it with you" was funnier. well, it was good. and cait and i danced during the scene changes. in the front row.       and emily drove me there. which was cool. michele does this thing sometimes which always makes me laugh... when were all together and we go to sit down at tables or in a theater or its being decided whos next to who or whos pared with who or whatever...sometimes, when michele sees, say, kara and i are both going for the same spot next to emily, shell say something like "let amanda sit next to emily, she never gets to talk to her"...which is nice, but i cant help but laugh abecause...i dont know...because its funny taht she does that. and it was between me and kara...as to who was gonna ride with emily there...michele had her say and i rode with emily. nicenesss.  today i didnt do much of anything...got up late and went to church late. almost drunk the wine. but i didnt. cause im a coward. and because i hadnt swallowed my host. i came home then... talked to emily about what we were doing...gave up on teh sleepover business and we spent the next several hours trying to decide what we were gonna do which was kinda nice because i was basically just talking to her on the phone for an hour about nothing... eventually...after a long while... we decided to go to red robin for drinks or smoothies or shakes or something. so we did. and she drove me. and it was nice. we sat tehre and talked some more for like 2 hours. very nice. nice. why do i keep using that word? well, beats me...but tahts what it was. nice. calming. peaceful. happy. comfortable. and i feel good. and she drove me home and i messed with the radio. and...hmm...i dont know. it was nice.  i didnt ask her either of the 2 things i was going to, but i guess tahts okay...i didnt want to ruin the conversation as it was. i can learn later. maybe i dont want to know now anyway. it needs to be in a more private setting. like maybe when she sleeps over next...which might be a while, but oh well. maybe soon, though. polaski day weekends coming up. high hopes for then.  i am happy right now. :-D.   Ive said it before and ill say it again... there are times...there are times when i really really wish it wasnt true... but it is... it always is... its worth it to have lived through those tears and bad days and lonely, frustrated times... its worth it for how nice it feels to actually talk to her every once in a while. its so worth it.  and maybe that makes me crazy...well, hell, i am crazy...  but i dont really care. screw it. friendship is amazing. i love emily. :-D.  "...and i think to myself, what a wonderful world"
