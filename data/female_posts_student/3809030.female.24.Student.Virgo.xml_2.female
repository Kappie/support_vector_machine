Would you ever pursue your friends girlfriend or boyfriend or even their spouse. I have comeacross this situation too many times this past month. Why? Why should I have to see it, not once, not twice but THREE times. What the heck!! It's getting kinda pathetic now. Not just pathetic but sickening.   My mom always said that, you end up finding friends that are like you. Could that be? Am I like them. Hmmm.... Actually they are Mike's friends. I met all of them through Mike, so technically Mike is the one that is like them.I pray to god that he is not like them. But, what if he is! No, he can't be. I trust him, I trust that he has more morals and ethics them that. Actually, I believe that we are together because we share the same belief's.   I have yet again, come across a sticky situation. I have been hanging around a group of people that I considered to be good wholesome people. Was I wrong! No, no, I take that back. They are good people, I'm not sure that they have the same morals as I do though.   I guess the attraction between a man and a woman is just too strong, even amongst good friends. How wrong is that! I would never, NEVER even think about dating any of Mikes friends had we divorce. Not that, that day would ever come. But seriously, I wouldn't even date someone that he was acquainted to. I don't know, it sucks, that's all I have to say about it.   Mike's sister is having her baby tomorrow. Well, actually she is going in to get induced at five in the morning. I wonder if she will deliver right away. They say that the first born always takes a while. I want to go bright and early to see my new nephew. I am so giddy right now. I could hardly contain myself.   I am going over to Lida's house tonight to have dinner and to talk with the gals. I hope there will be no trash talking, that's the last think I want to do. Thereare a lot of other importantcrap to worry about. Oh shoot, I have to go cook dinner before I leave. Mike will be home soon.
