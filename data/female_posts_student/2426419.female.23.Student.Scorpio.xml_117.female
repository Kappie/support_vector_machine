Thanksgiving-Food (duh), football, family, four day weekends, the start of       holiday mall craziness.  It's great!  3.  Easter-for obvious reasons, resurrection, salvation, victory, and fun-      colored eggs in fake grass.  Bunnyrific!  2.  Christmas-for more obvious reasons, the birth of the savior, the generous       spirit that seems to be contagious, the pretty lights, more good food, and      the presents, although not the point, don't make it less fun.  And my favorite holiday...I know the suspense is killing you...  1.  OU/texas!-okay, okay, I know what you're thinking, it's not technically a       holiday, but I can't help myself.  It's a great weekend, and for the past       four years, it's been pretty fun for me (177-54).  Besides, OU students       get the Friday before off, and in 2000 we also got the Monday after off.        So I think any time you get a three or four day weekend, it's a holiday.   So there you have it boys and girls.  Some of you will agree, and at least a couple of you will think I'm crazy.  Okay, so maybe all of you think I'm crazy already.  I can't really say I blame you.
