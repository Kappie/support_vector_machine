We might as well turn in our skates for the rest of the season because its obvious we're not going to get any better.  I mean seriously, if we cannot beat one of the worst teams in the league, i would say we're screwed major.  Although i am VERY proud of my Niko Kapanen, he was playing absolutely brilliant.  He was doing better than any other person on his line except Jere Lehtinen, who is just great all the time.  Shane Doan, the SUPER HOT captain of Pheonix, scored the first goal! He's only 23!  Hmmmm...yeah....so until the Stars are number 3 in the division, i want New Jersey to win the cup!  Coppell is doing great as usual, kicking ass all over the place. I want to go to the game tonight but i don't think i have anyone to go with so who knows.  Also its at freaking 9:30 and i'm kinda tired.   SIX MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!!! And guess who has all their Christmas Shopping done?!?!?!  I do!!!! Let's see.....i get to go to the Stars game this Friday......but i'm sure we'll lose that one too.  I've decided that i'm only going to go to Stars games to support my Niko Kapanen.  He needs support.  I might get out of it somehow by telling my mom i have a hockey party to go to this Friday....Britt and Jess? are we getting together or no? My house or what?......ok gtg bye!  Stars suck, Niko rocks!  ~~~Taylor~~~
