It's based on a camp the director used to work at that hails students who are now some of the most recognized actors.  It has tons of musical theater in it, Sondheim is heard throughout.  In fact Sondheim makes his own little cameo at the end of the movie.  Basically it's advertised as being about a composer who wrote one of the world's most popular musical and has since fallen from grace and has not produced anything since.  He is the special guest director for the summer.  But really the story follows the main characters and one more closely than the others.  Vlad is the fish out of water type, he is the only straight guy (at least that's how it's portrayed) and shows up at the auditions singing Wild Horses with his guitar in hand while every other student is in line warming up to sing whatever show tune they prepared.  It reminded me of the halls of the voice department at Berklee.  Anyway, the stories all follow the kids and everything they deal with when faced with the dreams of making it in show business.  The one girl, I can't think of her name, who ends up singing The Lady's Who Lunch in the middle of the show was incredible.  She, to me, was the shining star throughout the whole thing.  Vlad was annoying and just when I thought they had flawed him so entirely that he was real he says and does the stupidest things and ruins his character for anyone watching.  But despite the annoying characters and trite story lines, those who love musical theater will enjoy the numbers both arranged and original pieces.  SHATTERED GLASS I remember when this went down so when I saw it at the video store I picked it up.  It's about Steven Glass, the New Republic writer who, it was found, had fabricated almost all of the stories he had written.  The movie gives little backstory as to who Steven was and keeps more with explaining how well he was liked and how much his stories were revered all at the age of 25.  You grow to like him even though if you know anything about the character going into the movie, you know where this is all going.  You watch the meeting where he informs he is writting a piece on a teenage hacker who hacked a company titled Jukt Micronics and the twist in his story was that the hacker then ended up being hired by the company.  If you can't beat them join them mentality.  The only problem to all this was that Steven fabricated every word, every fact, every minor detail and what's even worse than this is that he knew how to manipulate the fact checking system by providing detailed notes he had to create and get his story pushed through even after going through editors and fact checkers.  The kid was basically a pathological liar and he was losing grip.  You actually feel bad for him after a reporter at Forbes online had discovered Glass's error.  It was only after Forbes called The New Republican for facts and details that the magazine began to get a clue.  You watch as Steven's editor tries to protect him and believe the kid just believed a bad source.  You are almost begging for Steven to confess just so he can end his web of lies.  You felt tired watching him try and make up a new lie every time an old one was blown apart.  I have to say that due the emotion evoked both Steven Skarsgaard and Hayden Christensen did an excellent job.  Others in the movie are Steve Zahn, Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevigny, Hank Azaria, etc.  So that's it thus far, check back later, I have more movies to watch....
