It's SO SUNNAY. I need more warm-weather clothes. I thought it was Friday all day, imagine my disappointment when it came to my attention that it was indeed, Thursday. Oh well. I'm trying to plot out my weekend which is so close yet so far.  *One hour later...* Wow that's depressing.. I just got off the phone with Ryan and he's grounded and can't call me or IM me or hang out with me this weekend *AGAIN*. Sigh. nv,ag3wiuh;a,j. And I have no money and my car is out of gas. That's not cool. But now I have no reason to  fill it up. This is very depressing. Well, now I can go be with Charlotte on Saturday and do her make up and stuff... This is very depressing.
