It is not in your head.  I recieved a comment that fights with my sister would be funny.  So since we recently had one I guess I will put it on my blog.   Well my sister came home and before she even got in her room she was yelling at me and telling me to get off the computer and get out of her room.  So I picked up the jar of peanut butter on her desk and strategicly launched it at the bedroom door so it would hit her as she walked into the room.  She called me a really bad name and threw my keys down the hall and under a chair.  She also told me to get off the computer again because she needed it.  So inspite of her throwing my keys I pushed the power button on the computer and completely turned it off.  She yelled at me again and I grabbed the hanger on her bed and threw it at her and she caught it and threw it right back so I picked up the phone and started to throw it at her and my mom started yelling so I got my keys and ran out of the house so my sister would get the worst of the punishment for waking up the beast.
