Bullshit's what I thought too. I don't know what to write. This is hard, because this is a public journal, which kinda defeats the purpose, because a journal is supposed to be private, right? I usually like to write shit that's straight out about how I feel, but I have a feeling that if I do, I'll get sued by someone.       So..... maybe I should start with me. Seems a little self-indulgent, but this is for those of you who don't know who the hell I am. My name's Maddie. I'm a fourteen year old, sarcastic, cynical bitch. Sometimes. I could call myself pessimistic, b/c I sure act like it, but I'm usually just joking around. When things get serious I'm always looking for the good side of things, i guess. When it comes right down to it, I like honesty. A lot. Bullshitting is just a way of getting around the things you need to deal with and don't want to. I have a lot of philosophies and shit, but I'm not in the mood to type em all out right now, so I'll share em later.       I went to the first freshman football game yesterday. We suck. Oh well, it was fun anyway. I saw my ex, Dan, there. It's confusing. We met on his blind date with one of my best friends Joyce. I didn't want to go out with him, because she still liked him, But when she told me she didn't anymore, I said yes to Dan, I found out Joyce still liked him, and a week later we broke up. Then, another week later, I missed him and asked him out again. He said yes, and AnOtHeR week later, he dumped me b/c of reasons I'd rather not mention. Yeh...that gave it away. We "disagreed" on some things. Now, he's asking me to go back out with him, and I can't. I don't feel that way towards him anymore, and I like someone else, which is another topic we'll discuss later. Isn't all this 14-year old drama fun? We're all so....mature! Ahem....anyways.       I'm out. luv you all.bye. :P
