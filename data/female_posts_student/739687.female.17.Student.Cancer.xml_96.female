Ya know, I need to just get over crap and just let go. Go have some crazy times with some crazy cool kids and just have a blast. So yeah, nothing too exciting has gone on lately. Which sucks...everyone else has so much fun, and I am just so boring.  I can't wait until marching season is over.  I can't wait until I get a job.  I can't wait until I get my liscense.  I can't wait until I graduate.   So much anticipation...so very much!
