Many years ago the free offer was only for a white color of the newly released line. The last three I've received were all for the Body by Victoria (the first one being white only  the other two were for any color). I hope next year, they'll start pushing a different line.  I love the free offers! I even got a free purse spray bottle of the Body by Victoria fragrance through one of those postcards! I love how you get it without having to buy anything, unlike some of the other offers that you get nowadays. I used to feel bad and buy stuff that I don't need anyway just for the sake of buying something while I redeem my gift. I'm glad to report that I'm over that. I just go in, get my free gift and leave. As the Romans say,  vini vedi vici !  You can chalk that up to one of two things: I've gotten more thick-skinned with age or eversince I moved out, I've been poor and can't afford to be so frivolous anymore. Probably a combination of both.
