I found a quote on the internet that inspired me to post something: "Life is a waste of time, time is a waste of life. So get wasted all of the time and have the time of your life." Cleverand half true, I think. Sometimes life is a waste of time, but rarely. Time is definitelynota waste of life since without time, no life would exist. Heh, the last part is the best butI doubt I'd wanna get wasted all of the time...o_O Oh well, back to my world...   I felt so bad yesterday. I hated myself, for everything.Actually, it's been going onfor thepast week...why do I feel we allaren't equal? It's not fair thatsome peoplehavesome thingsthat others envy them for. "It all works out in the end," right? Well where's the end and when's it coming? For many, it can never work out completely. There's only a small possibility that anything will be alright. I know I sound so negative, but it's all true. You always want what you can't have and no one's ever satisfied with what they do possess. There are so many things that can and are denied to you, and there's nothing you can do about it. Compensations are what you recieve instead or nothing is given at all. I feel like I've been denied what I want and denied even a simple compensation instead. But there's a reason for everything, right? Wrong. The only reason I'm not given the things I want or even deservethe most, is because the world is lettingothersget lucky on my misfortunes. Although, I do have to take into consideration the unluckyevents that happen to the fortunate sometimes. I don't see them suffer as much as I usually do though. Either that or they refuse to show it. Wish I could refuse to show my sorrow when I've been dealt a horrible hand. Maybe that's why better things happen to people who don't show their unhappiness. Fate is weaving my tapestry slowly but surely, then snipping the strings faster than the loom can work...
