Told Julie about the cowboy hat I fell in love with and now she's telling me about Troy. Damn, I wanted to watch Troy but mommy won't let me. Vivo and Mark are gone now so yeah. Can't stop talking about the cowboy hat! Haha! I'm so weird.   Well, church tomorrow! Sunday worship. Hmm, what should I do after worship? Not much to do... I'll probably be stuck at home with nothing to do while the weather may be really good outside. Oh... speaking of good weather... I got sunburns on my shoulders. It's so gay. Mommy says I gotta avoid getting a tan because tanned skin doesn't go with my beige dress. Damn... I wanted to get a tan on my arms and face and then a small sunburn on nose and cheeks! Hee hee~   Ooh~ Vivo's back! Talking to her on MSN now. Julie stopped for some reason. Oh well. So yeah... Hmm, should update the songs on my MP3 player... blah, too lazy. Hee hee!  Now that I think about it, I got a few "girly"-ish tops today. Haha... kinda surprising myself. Oh well. There was this t-shirt I got from H.M. and 2 other tops I got from this shop full of preppy clothing. Haha! I'm so weird.  I like the "girl next door" look. By the phrase "girl next door", I don't mean like the movie "THE GIRL NEXT DOOR"! I mean like... a hometown girl-ish outfit. Like... what I wore today. Nothing too preppy, slutty, tomboy-ish, or anything! Just... the girl next door! Nice simple grey spaghetti strap [no logos], pair of blue jeans [no logos], blue shirt around the waist [tiny logo], and normal white running shoes. Haha! It's so casual but... nice. I like it a lot. That combination, I mean. Haha!  Geez, why in the world am I talking so much about clothes? I just go on and on and on! Somebody PLEEAAASE shut me up! I talk too much. Yes, I realized that... not just now though. Like, I noticed it ages ago. I just don't stop! See what I mean? Phew! I gotta shut up for once! Maybe not talk for one whole day! Nah... too hard! I always have a comment about anything and everything!   Back to my other topic... it's gonna be pretty boring tomorrow! I'll type out my scheduel...  8:30am - eat breakfast 9:00am - watch a bit of tv 9:20am - get picked up 9:30am - go to worship 10:50am - worship ends, hang out time 11:15am - hop onto the bus and go to BHES 11:30am - CD team at BHES 12:30pm - take the bus back to RHCBC 12:45pm - get home 1:00pm - eat lunch 1:30pm - go back on computer  Then after 1:30 there's not much for me to do. Maybe I'll go outside with some friends... hmm, I wonder if Moca will feel like going outside... or grab some sportier friends and play some basketball? Maybe... Haha~ I'm so indecisive!   Yes... anyway... what else is there to talk about? Hmm, still "debating against my conscience". I know that I should do a certain thing but if I do that, it can lead to a good AND bad result... I know an alternate way of getting around this but... the best thing to do is tell the truth although I don't think I should. [if you're reading this and is complete confuzzled, then whatever... this part is for myself]I don't want it to happen but I gotta fix this somehow without revealing the source...? *sighzZ* Screw it. Whatever. Don't know what to do about. Usually, I'd say that if I don't know what to do about it, then it's best to do nothing at all... but in this case, I can't do nothing about it. Impossible. Gotta fix it somehow to avoid misunderstandings.
