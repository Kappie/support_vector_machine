Next year means highschool, which is good, and I'm stoked about that but, in the short term all I have to look forward to is summer, and in actuality I'm dreading it...I'm going to go insane with boredom. I still have the biggest thing for N.P. but I guess it's a one sided thing. I'm used to that so I can live with it, it's just kinda disappointing because he created the illusion that there was something there. I want to be over him enough to kick his ass, but I'm not, and right now I seriously doubt I ever will be...
