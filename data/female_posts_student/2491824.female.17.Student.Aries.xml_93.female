I had a really hard time pretending to be interested. :After that we went to a country club for the reception.. There we stood around for at least an hour.. people were mingling, listening to the string trio playing, getting drinks from one of the three (free!) bars, and munching on hors d'oeuvres. Then we finally went into the dining room place... There was a 10-piece band and three singers. (They rocked! They played everything from big band swing to Louis Armstrong to Sinatra to broadway tunes to No Doubt--yes, No Doubt...) ...Then we were served a super-yummy 5-course meal...   ....Bah, I'm rambling, I think...  I'm bored... And tired...  Oh, that "bad news" from yesterday is that Ramsey (my history teacher) said that he was going to make sure that I don't go on the theatre trip to the State Thespian Festival because I have had too many absences this semester...  Bah.. Don't teachers usually let their favorite students get away with more than their other students? ...Ramsey has said several times that I am one of his favorites... So, why won't he just turn his head away and ignore this?  (Yeah, I already know the answer... Because he is concerned about my grades and stuff... Bah!.... Stupid teachers that give a damn...hehe) I've been looking forward to going for a year now... ever since I got back from the trip last year...  ...G is going to kill me...   I need sleep...
