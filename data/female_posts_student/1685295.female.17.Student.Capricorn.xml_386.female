I'm going to miss you all terribly, and will hopefully be in touch as often as email allows - or whenever I get sick of Sedgie and pass the time by writing you postcards.  Oh, completely random point. Mr. Fried was all proud of this quote in his classroom that said, "Never doubt that a small group of committed individuals can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." (Margaret Mead)  And then, this week's Onion, in one of the horoscopes, said, "Never doubt that a small group of committed individuals can change the world with a vial of smallpox virus and a few kilograms of plutonium."  On that note, I leave you for London.  Bye, guys.
