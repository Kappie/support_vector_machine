I wanted to say on behalf of my blog that it's feeling the lack of commments.  Let's remedy that shall we?  *phsycicly seeks non-commentors, and extract mace*  jk.     So nervous/stressed symptoms in full swing?  sure thing.  can't sleep, got a tummy ache, and commence biting thumbs.  (My nails dissapeared around finals time)  T-H-U-M-B spells relief.  but I really do have to get to bed now, I have to leave the house by 10 tomorrow.  Have a Merry and a Braaaaaaaaa. Sorry Rent again.  I really am going to be the wierd kid.  Oh well, I"m used to it.  Have a wonderful day.
