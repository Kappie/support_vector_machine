Well that was all fine and wonderful, except everyone is fighting with each other due to the fact that they cannot figure out what to do with my grandma.  They ended up taking her to the hostpital...strike 1...We took 2 horses down there to sell and only sold one...strike 2...The trailer lost it's brakes and marker lights before we even started home...strike 3...They tried to fix the trailer, which didn't work, so my mom decided we could just come home anyway (this was at 2 p.m.) it's an eight hour drive...strike 4...The trip was going good, until we were coming out of Gillette and HIT A DEER!!...strike 5...So pretty much the entire weekend was an entire BUST!!!!  So for all of you who love summers out there....What's the deal, this is my summer right now...sleep, work, sleep, work, have 3 days off where i sleep more and don't really do anything, then start the whole cycle over again.  At least I get to see people during school.  Well I guess that's all I have to ramble about right now, so everyone have a wonderful fricken day.
