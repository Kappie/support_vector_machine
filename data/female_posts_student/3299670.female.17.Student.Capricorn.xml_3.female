I realised I hadn’t even thought about any of them in a long while.  However, I updated H:TNG yesterday. I have no reviews yet, although I know I don’t deserve them. I’ve given up hope anybody even reads it anymore. I plan to update regularly, which hopefully will bring my fanbase back. I just started this blog for everybody who reads my fanfictions.  Please feel free to comment about which stories you’d like updated. Or comment on idea’s for stories. I made this so that I can answer more personally to reviews than I can on ff.net. Help me make this great. Akasha xxxx
