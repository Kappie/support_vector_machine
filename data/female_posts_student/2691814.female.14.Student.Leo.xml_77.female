I was with cindy and i leaned over cuz i was dizzy and i fell. I didn't tell my parents about it when gabby and cindy took me home. I took a shower and went straight to my room. Mom came in and asked me if i had tripped or passed out. Turns out Gabby told her. So now i have to call gabby. I want to feel better.My arm hurts. My head hurts. i just wanna talk to someone. Really talk. I need to rest. I didn't see bill today...Tomarrow is another FCAT test. Monday-Thursday we have school then Spring Break. I wish i could go to WV for it.
