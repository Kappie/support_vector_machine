I really love Japan to the extent that i promise myself that i'll go back at least twice but there might be many more visits in my life.....all thanks to the wonderful people that i met in my trip that made my japan trip such an enjoyable one!!!    First in Fukuoka, even though only knowing those friends for less than 6weeks...but they showed really kind and warm hospitality that i thought i am really lucky to meet them!! They brought me around, showed me Fukuoka city, which is like any other Japan city, a crowded but interesting for a tourist. This is the first time i see how people can fit so many things in such a small space....and yet, the stuff there are well organised and neat. Then finally get to go to Osaka!!!!   Wanted to meet Yuko in Osaka for god knows how long!!!!! She is just a rare friend of mine....both of us has similar thoughts in some ways....but our path is almost completely different.....it was interesting to hear her talking about her being someone who's not so mainstream and ....i'll explain further in my other post.  Wow.....bullet train...it's real fast and expensive!!!! Finally reached Osaka.....seeing Yuko itself is a joy.....i was smilling in the heart seeing her sitting at the station waiting for me. But meeting her only for the second time, i didnt have any moment of ease trying to cook up some topics of conversation. We just click once we started talking....something that i think is rare.....coz i wasnt even feeling that we had meet each other since May 2003......it was like i am meeting someone whom i am very close, someone whom i am very comfortable with.....  Then the adventure that i am hoping for since i started writing to her has finally begin!!!!!!
