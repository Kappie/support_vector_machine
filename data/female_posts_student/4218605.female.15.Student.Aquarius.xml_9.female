I changed my font color, link color, hover-effects, and what the right sidebar says in terms of Archives and Previous Posts. And the font. And I added a midi file thanks to IRA! Thanks dude. It was fun singing to it. Awesome, awesome.  Anything you see is done by me, and my knowledge. If you want help, ask me.  â™¥
