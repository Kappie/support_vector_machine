STEVEN FISKE CALLED ME!!!  so yesterday i left him a phone message, and i would have bet my life that he wouldn't have the balls to return it, but he did!  come to find out... steven and lola did date for 4 years, but this past december steven found out that lola was cheating on him and they broke up.  because they've been through so much together, they continued to sort of date on and off... as it was difficult for both of them to stop all communication.  so they still see each other every few weeks, but are not together.  according to steven, she's having a hard time getting over him and she can't handle him seeing anyone else and that they are NOT together!  funny thing is- i believe him.  now, i don't know steven overly well, i'll be the first to admit, but i honestly don't think he'd lie to me.  i think he's telling me the truth about him and lola.  don't worry though... i'm not going to go running up to toronto into his arms, because i didn't get out of a perfectly good long distance relationship to get myself into another one, but i think maybe next time i travel to toronto, i'd call him up and see what he's up to?  i dunno....    life has a funny way of speaking to me...
