I spend about $400.00 a month on recharging phone cards through them. This is so Rob can call me from Iraq.  It's crazy cause I will buy 2600 sum minutes at a time and it will convert to only 500 minutes.  Big bummer indeed. The sad part is I have been spending most of the time we talk lately on nonsense such as the problem I have been having back here at home.  Bat's have been finding their way into my home after dark. My house is only 10 years old but it has managed to give me carbon monoxide poisoning twice and infested my room with bats. I don't know what kind of sick joke that is being played on me or who is trying to disturb me but I feel like i'm trapped in my own personal final destination.  My dad is "trying" to get rid of these bats but i'm really not seeing any progress in it.  Let's just say my lack of sleep isn't going to win me a beauty contest anytime soon. I'm trying to switch my sleep pattern into day time.. but i'm missing too much and my body doesn't want to cooperate with it.  I'm sick of hearing "it won't hurt you" from people. LIES LIES LIES!!!! I'll tell you one thing though if i wake up looking like bat girl my life is seriously going to take a social dive... even though it's nonexistant already...
