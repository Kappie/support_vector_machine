The show was truly excellent, the writers and producers really outdid themselves with this episode.  They provided the perfect ending to a wonderful show and satisfied my curiosity with the lives of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha.  Still I have to admit that I am truly sad that this show has come to an end.    Embarrassing as it may be, I am addicted to this show.  My only regret is that I found it too late and now its over.  I began watching the show in the 3rd season, I think.  I suppose I can understand why they would choose to bring an end to the long running sitcom, Matt said it best when he stated “if they run it any longer it will go from being  Sex  the City  to  Golden Girls .”  I laughed, of course, but the mere fact that he’s right sort of irks me.   So there it is for all to see, my dirty laundry.  I am shamelessly, hopelessly addicted to  Sex  the City .  So to the actresses and actors, not to mention other fans, I bid you all adieu.  I’ll miss you.  However, I am trying to look on the bright side; I can always buy all of the episodes on DVD.  ~Kristyn
