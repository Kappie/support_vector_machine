It turns out that the co-creator/Psycho Creep John Romero is the last Boss or whatever (I'm sounding awfully Geeky). Anyways, when you start the level (the last level, Icon of Sin) there is this voice, but you can't understand what it is saying unless you reverse it. Now how the hell would I even know where to begin to reverse it...geez Louise. Anyways, it says something like, "To beat the game, you must defeat me, John Romero". So obviously, that means that I have to go back and look at the Fuckin Head On The Spike again, which I have no intention of doing, so I will not be able to beat the game...unless I can do something else to beat it because clearly, the Head On The Fuckin Spike is not able to move. So I'm guessing I have to kill the huge wall that shoots over the boxes that turn into the monsters/aliens/robots/whatevers. But CLEARLY, you can't kill a fuckin wall...so CLEARLY, I CAN'T FINISH THE GAME. Which CLEARLY means that I have wasted numerous hours of my life cheating and shooting stupid monsters/aliens/robots/whatevers in a stupid game with stupid graphics when I could have been making cookies or doing something not to boyish/childish. It's all Peter's fault, he got me friggin hooked on that game...once I picked up that BFG 9000 I knew there was no turning back.
