Sunday afternoon was a time for childhood. A day of skipping through mud puddles and picking lilacs for the neighbours.  Sunday afternoons are a fading memory. The simple pleasures of unsweetened Freshie, running wild on playgrounds, and reading books I’d read thousands times before.  Sunday afternoons are for rituals. Traditions to be passed from old to young, like the tomato aspect you are forced to ingest every Christmas.  Sunday afternoons are a day of rest.
