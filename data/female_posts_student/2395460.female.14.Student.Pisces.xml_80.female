The Nike  urlLink MP3RUN  aims to motivate youto run fasterwhilekeeping you entertained with its FM tuner and built-in 256mb of storage . The device comes with asmall bluetooth-powered sensor you attach to your running shoes. Your progress report(for both distance and speed) is then wirelessly logged into the player and you can upload your results to a Nike site to track your workouts. The MP3RUN even detects when you're off your normal time and audibly (probably in a creepy robotone) tells you to step it up. How innovative and annoying.   I'm convinced the MP3RUNis all I need to be ready for  urlLink Beijing  in 2008. I just need to download a little bit of inspirational music. Can anyone direct me to " Run, You Pig, Run "?

Also coming are the 512 mb version, the FM radio only, and the CD Player with FM.
