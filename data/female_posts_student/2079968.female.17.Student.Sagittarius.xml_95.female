It's like I can't even organize anything into being coherent.  Mmm...maybe I should do some stream-of-conciousness writing.  That always works quite well.  Oh, and I never posted my thoughts on The Passion like I meant to a few days ago. I've still not seen it...I'm waiting for some of the crowds to die down a little...and I'm also waiting until I have money...  But yeah...I can handle violence/gore, but I'm not one of those people who like to see that thing.  A lot of people don't wanna see the film because of the gore, but to me, seeing such a vivid depiction would make people understand and appreciate what Christ did even more...also, America just does not understand what true suffering is...we sit in our little comfort zones, thinking if we get fat or ugly or if we get a papercut that we're going to die.  If people think life is bad now, myself is included with those people...I hope more people see...I hope more people believe. But that's just me.  I have a lot more to say about this whole thing.  In fact, I'm sure after I see it I'll have a great deal to say.  But now I need to finish homework.  Signing off.
