I'm also going to get goldfish and guppies and what not. I'm going to name my pleco David Lee Roth II in honour of my frog.  Anyways... today was pretty cool. Nelsey is camping this weekend, so Marissa and Dave took over the karate class. They said the kids class was a little group of hellians, but the adult class was good, so I am glad. Justin was there today... he's so hot. I did some of my homework for this weekend, but I'm not totally finished. I set up my fish tank too- all I need is a filter, some fish, and maybe some cool plastic plants. I'm excited about that stuff (:  Apple Turnovers are one of the best food items ever invented  I find it  quite  upsetting that I do not have any classes with Nicole W.  Party on!  -Candice
