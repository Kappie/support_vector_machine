My mom, dad,  and I were screaming at the top of our lungs when Lauren wasn't dead and started to get up as Sydney and Vaughn were kissing.  Then Vaughn took her out for good (we hope).  I want to know what happened to Marshall.  Poor, poor Marshall--he really didn't deserve that.  Not at all.  And the whole mask thing was really gut wrenching.  Knowing who was who and that kind of thing.  I totally knew that it was Syd with Lauren's mask and voice modifier in the cell next to Sark.  They wouldn't just put those two right next to each other in jail, allowing them to conspire.  So now we wait until bleeping January 2005 to find out unanswered questions and what was in the top secret document at the end.  I'm still hoping that if enough people complain to ABC, we might not have to wait in anguish that long.  *fingers crossed*
