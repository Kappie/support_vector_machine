Hhmmm some people are getting annoyed at *some* other people, was kinda stressing me. aanyway. wat happened? ok lol i'll just recount the whole day. :P  it was so hard getting outa bed this morn :( but i dragged myself out and went to school -- the last day!!! didn't do much in PD, resulted in us talking alot, writing a bit, and me bragging about hockey cos noone ever noticed us. lol -- sir said hed put something on the sign out the front. ah we suck. lol  then i had sac. that kinda sucked but we didn't do too much... then maths - as if that could ever be fun! BUT OMG OMG i got 14/16 for the second section of our assessment (thats the only part we have gotten back yet). That equals 87.5% which i am pretty happy about because i have always hated maths and at the beginning of the year convinced myself that i sucked at it. it's all about the confidence - and not stressing too much hehe.  i'm listening to natalie imbruglia which jen so kindly burnt for me :) thanks! and thanks for the link on your site ;)     OMG i was just reading my brothers report (it was an accident, lol it was just sitting on the kitchen bench). he failed so much, his top mark was 70%. HE is the crappest. He doesn't even care how badly he is failing despite the money that my parents pay for him to go to that gay school. ugh he really irritates me - so ungrateful and lazy. he got like 40% for one of his classes. He is the smelliest! my parents fork out SO much money for his gay school fees, uniform, textbooks that he never uses etc.. and he doesnt even try! oh and he gets to go on the version of duke of ed for pansies.     ANYWAY  lol stella (dog) just went outside to roll in the grass and sneeze.   bye bye
