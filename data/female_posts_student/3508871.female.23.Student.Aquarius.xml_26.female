We started our journey at 6:30am, so that we could get first in line and to avoid the mid-afternoon sun as much as possible. Weather in the morning was cloudy and abit chilly but it warmed out from 10am onwards and boy did it get hot later! By the time we finished climbing, Travis and me were baked from the sun. Yeah...forgot about SUN BLOCK! Sport climb was what we did and we finished three routes: Nine Gallon Buckets(level:5.9), The Outsider(level:5.9) and Five Gallon Buckets(level:5.8).Interested in Sport Climbing and Traditional climbing? check out SMITH ROCK!
