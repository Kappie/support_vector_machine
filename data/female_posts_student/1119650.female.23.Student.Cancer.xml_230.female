I tried to kiss you  on Brooklyn Avenue,  but you got in your car, before I could move.   I've been falling like the rain,  but you've got your umbrella in my way.   Fists and fingers, tongues and teeth.  I want to see you, I'm tired of my dreams;  nights of wishing, I could open my mouth  and when I finally did speak,  you were nowhere to be found.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again   I had the sun in my hands  I had the sun in my hands  'til you said you liked the rain.  I had it all in my hands, I had it all  but I gave it all away.   Did I scare you off, by being honest?  how come we never see the end, 'til it's right there upon us?  If you want, I can go away,  but like the rain, I'll come again some other day.   I've been falling like the rain--  you've got your umbrella in my way again.  One of these days I'm going to come along  in the middle of sunshine and be a  little sunshower  make you rise up like a flower,  and you can be my little daisy, be my daisy. " -d.e.v.
