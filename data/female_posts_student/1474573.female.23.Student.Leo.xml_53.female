"I wear anonymity like a warm shroud". I ran into Big Brother wayne (who is SUCH a sweetheart by the way)  soo... I'm trying to figure out a title for my chapbook. Yes, I'm considering lines from my poems but I'm looking for a title that represents where i am as writer right now or better yet exemplifies a cohesive string between poems... blah blah blah  If you've EVER heard my suggestions for baby names you might understand how bad I am this stuff ( I want to name my future son Thor and his sister will be Thumbelina) So far I've got    rights of passage  Saucepois  The Aftermath Staring Back  This way.....Left of Wah  On the brink of imagication  A funny inversion of me  please email me with suggestions backchannel  dianeway@yahoo.com
