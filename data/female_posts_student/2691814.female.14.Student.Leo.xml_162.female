Things are still boring...found out i can read whatever book i want this summer cuz im in english honors. So i best be going to the book store soon. I think i've had too much time to myself lately. I've been thinking waaayyy to much for my own good lol. Feeling better with my cold that i had. And it just rained so its pretty out and wet. Hmmm....im thinking about doing a reading on myself tonight...check the moon phase hopefully its not overcast. Light my white candle and just see what happens. I deffinately need todo something other than sit around and watch tv...but hey whats summer for? lol lalalala, thats exactly it lol. okay well, im going to go back to my room and sit or lay down, sleep, wake up then eat.
