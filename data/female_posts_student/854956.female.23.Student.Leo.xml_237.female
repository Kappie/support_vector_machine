Bad news: Teresa is quitting. :'( I'm so sad about this, because she and I have really grown close and built a really good friendship... and I'm going to miss her terribly. She was a wonderful guide for me in the workplace, as well as for when I begin teaching (she has a degree in reading, and teaching reading (now) at a school here in town). Thankfully, I got her phone number, and she told me to stop by and see her Friday before I leave from getting my paycheck, because it's her last day. :-( She said, "I can't let you go without getting one more hug from my Kels..." And she was crying, and I was crying... and it was just HORRIBLE!
