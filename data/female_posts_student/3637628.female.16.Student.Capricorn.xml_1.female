Don't be so alarmed, it was originally two weeks, then one week, then the weekend.   Anyway, theres a lot of ground to cover.  As we were leaving school on thursday, me and alex managed to finagle TWELVE history books.  It was really funny to see a group of us each carrying one or two books around.  Just thought i should throw that out there.  On thursday, the last day of school, what do me and my dorky friends do?  Go to a bookstore.  Get this!  At said bookstore, we all decided we liked books so much that we would start a BOOK CLUB!!  Yeah, we're cool.  After the bookstore, we thoroughly destroyed Chrissies house.  After a rousing game of apples to apples (Awkward!)  we played a less rousing game of finish line.    P.s.  each paragraph is so short so that i get through the whole day, and so that you read all of them.  Later that night was graduation.  I didn't go, being in sucky mc suck suck choir, but my homies in womens choir  did.  Holla to the graduating class and mis amigos con hermanos y hermanas en el clase de graduacion.    At like seven forty five, as the storm of the century approacheth, i headed to alex's house.  Once people started showing up, it was really awesome.  We played a little cranium, played a little poker, and the boys showed us the darker side of the little mermaid.  All in all, a fairly fun evening.    Afterwards, we retired to moira's house as the boys settled in for a long night of losing money.  We watched pretty woman (which we borrowed from alex's house!) and promptly fell asleep after thirty seconds.  I wake up a lot in the night when i'm sleeping on a couch or the floor, and i'm usually freaked out by that.  But at moira's, everytime i woke up, there was an adorable dog at my feet!  In the morning, Mrs. Davies made us a rockin breakFEAST, and her little brother, the ninja, killed his friend in the garage.    I have been sticking to the bare bones this whole time, and i still have three days to cover?  crap.  Onfridaymeandmymomgotinthataforementionedfight,thenwedrovedowntograndpopstopaintchristinasbedroom.  Whoah, thats not gonna work.  Anyway, we sanded, caulked, and spackled our brains out.  I should really go into some background on this, or you won't understand the level of work involved.  The room at grandpops house that christina will be staying in didn't have what we call 'walls' before.  It had a form of blockage from the outside elements, but there were so many cracks and holes, that they didn't really constitute walls.  Don't even get me started on the closet.  I just wanna say that fifteen seconds in the closet would kill me.  Anyway, it took the entire day just to clean, spackle, sand, and caulk.  On saturday, Christina and Mama went back to wash the walls to get ready for paint.  If You think that would be a small job, you've never been to grandpops.    Sunday we painted, the fathers in our life stayed in the living room and watched tv while me, mama, christina, robbie, and eric painted painted painted.  Daniel played on christina's newly set up computer.  Ahh, i thinks thats everything.  I will post more later  Jess.  P.s.  IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO POST COMMENTS
