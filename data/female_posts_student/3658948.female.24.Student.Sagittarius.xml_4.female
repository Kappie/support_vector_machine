Before actually seeing Seattle, I assumed it would be a city full of hippes and yuppies and not much else; I was right about the hippies and yuppies, but Seattle is beautiful in its own right, and well worth the trip. What I liked about it was the widespread tolerance toward dogs. I was surprised at how many stores allowed dogs inside, and it seemed like every other person on the street had a dog with them. Even in Barnes and Noble (a huge, two-story building -- ohhhh yeeeeaaahh), a number of dogs were sprawled beside their owner's chairs or snuggled in their laps while they read.  Pike's Market was overwhelming, but fascinating. Apparently it has three levels, but I only got to see one. The major drawback are the public bathrooms, which are unbelievably gross and always have long lines in front of them. I guess that's not surprising, because the market itself is a crush of people and vendors. The brief glimpses of fruit, fish, flowers, vegetables, etc. that I was able to see amid the crowd looked better than what you'd typically find in a supermarket, especially the flowers. They were arranged in big, satisfying bunches wrapped in white paper, with dahlias the size of grapefruits mixed with various other lush, varicolored flowers I couldn't put a name to. I didn't get to see the guys throwing the fish around like I'd hoped to because there was an enormous crowd around that area, but oh well.  The thing about Seattle I found a little difficult was its lack of the usual fast food restaurants. On practically every other block you can find a Thai restaurant, and there are various other small-business restaurants as well that you can't find anywhere else. That's cool, but if you're trying to haul ass to the airport and you want a sausage egg McMuffin, you're screwed. Yes, I'm all for breaking down the fast food monopoly in favor of healthier eating and a better climate for small businesses, but dammit, I'm a North Dakotan and I want my meat and potatoes. If I stayed there longer, I most likely would have adapted to some extent, but hell, sometimes you need a little grease.  Which brings me to Dick's. One night, my sister and her husband took me out to see "Anchorman" in Spokane (It was fucking hilarious. All those pompous movie reviewers who graded it a C+ really need to loosen up. I give it an A. My favorite part was when Paul Rudd -- I forget his character's name -- put on that jaguar cologne and everyone in the office started retching and heading for the door. "It smells like a used diaper full of Indian food!" "It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!" "It smells like Bigfoot's dick!" Ahhh hahahaha. Anyway, the other movies I'm excited about seeing are "The Village" and that Exorcist prequel), and afterward took me to Dick's for a snack because everything else was closed. It was just like McDonalds, but nothing had been microwaved and therefore it's a little bit better. I'm guessing they hadn't changed the frying grease in awhile, though. My brother in law said that there are two Dick's in Seattle, and that everyone went there to graze at night. Dick's is extremely cheap. The burgers are about 69 cents each, and it seems like a retro-70's establishment. However, it looks like it would really suck to work there.  Coeur d'Alene (northern Idaho) is also really pretty, but in a pleasant, uncrowded, rural way, unlike Seattle. There's a big lake on their reservation, and the mountains are much smaller than the ranges surrounding the reservation. It was extremely relaxing after Seattle, but the real entertainment value was listening to my brother-in-law go off about tribal politics on his reservation. Actually, the politics on my rez are slightly worse, but I can practically guaruntee that every reservation has a few crazies installed in key areas of tribal government that make life miserable for damn near everyone else.  Anyway, it was fun. I never got around to the Coeur d'Alene pow-wow, but my brother-in-law says that there are very few vendors there, which is my main reason for going to pow-wows. I mostly like to check out the jewelry and beadwork, and occasionally eat an Indian taco, if it's worth it. Yeah, the dancing is fun to watch, too, but I prefer to move around and shop.
