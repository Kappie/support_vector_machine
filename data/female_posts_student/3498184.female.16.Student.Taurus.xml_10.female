After waiting around for about 2 hours, I learned what I need to do is take 3 IBprophin every 4 hours. My mom bought me a strawberry-banana milkshake becuz I hadn't eaten in 39 hours and it helps to have something in your stomach before taking medication. It took about 2 hours before I felt something, then after 4 hours it felt better, after I took the second dose it has been getting better. I can still feel it, but it's way less painful then the past 2Â½ days. YAY!  I'm still thinking if I want to go to school tomorrow. I think I can make it...but that might be the IBprophin talking. Plus, swimming is gonna blow chunkz, but I could get a note from my mom. I'm pretty sure Im going, but tomorrow I have so many things due. *sighs* I can't break my 3 year streak now, with only 17 days left of school. I better start my HW.  ~Bayz
