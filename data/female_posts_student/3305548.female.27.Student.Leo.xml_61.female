I can change my font, make it different colors, justify it, bullet it, and by appearances...even insert a picture within the body of my text if I wish. WOW. Cool.    Onto more personal news:  Yesterday was the last night of the Fair...and Buddy Jewel played with the sponsorship and introduction by my hubby's radio station. Since most of my readers also share the lack of country music fan status that I boast I will explain just who this guy is. He won the allcountry music versionAmerican Idol, Nashville Star, with a song written for his daughter called "Help Pour Out the Rain." It's a schmaltzy little ditty that got airplay left and right. It's about his daughter asking him if when she goes to heaven she can be one of the angels that helps pour out the rain. It caught the attention of a lot of country music fans, and the album the song is on went gold last January - as he reminded his audience several times. Right, well I didn't stay to watch his set - he and his band just didnt put on the show that Emerson Drive did. He did cover Bob Seeger, but even that can't save a man who considers it kosher to perform in way loose muscle shirts. The odd thing about Buddy is that he looks soooooooooooo much like a younger version of my step dad it is a little scary. I took a few pictures of him, which I will post later.    My hubby's parents are gone for a week!!! Yay! We get to live like normal private individuals who don't live with their extended family!!! My excitement is bubbling over.    I read that Whoopi Goldberg lost her job with Slim Fastdue to making a joke about Bush at a Democratic campaign of some kind featuring several Hollywood stars...apparently she used his last name to refer to a female sexual region. She can't have been the first. I guess Slim Fast' s corporate headquarters is in Florida where Jeb Bush still rules the roost. Funny how it all works out.    I also read a USA Today story about the rapper Jadakiss whom, for the record, I have never hear of before. Apparently seven words in his new song have attracted alot of attention - "Why did Bush knock down the towers?" Radio stations and MTV are both running edited versions of the song at the moment. This is a new form of artistic censorship. It doesnt involve cussing, nor sexual innuendo. They have censored his political statement. So much for freedom of speech and artistic integrity. So much for one's more man's ability to cast a critical eye toward the presidency. According to the article, Jadakiss says he doesnt actually blame Bush for the towers falling but rather thinks Bushhasnt taken responsibility fornot protecting the country well enough before September 11th and for not taking care of business properly since. In the article Jadakiss also mentions"Fahrenheit 9/11" and it is mentioned that he back John Kerryand is registering tovote himself for the first time. Of all the rap lines and songs to get the radio edit,this instance strikes me as rediculous. Lines about god arent removed from songs, lines about booty shakin' make it to the airwaves, even some cleverly embedded lines about drugs and sex find their way to radio listeners ears. Its an abosilute shame thatmembers of themedia today doesntbackthe first ammendment in cases where it doesnt conflict with FCC regulations.    *Jumps off Soap Box*    And now for the promised movie review:  I, Robot: Will Smith, a robot named Sonny  The premise of this movie is  loosly  based on the book of the same title by Issac Asimov, which I think I read in Junior High, but cant actually remember. I admit I read a few reviews about the movie before I went. I try to have a good idea of what I am in for. They were, for the most part, unnecessarily harsh. It is true that I, Robot pretty much borrowed ideas from every other major robot movie ever made to date, and recycled them. From the question of the dreams of robots (Hello?!? The subtitle of Blade Runner is "Do robots dream of electric sheep?") to the idea of a cop that is part robot part human (Robocop) and the list gets longer. The movie even borrowed the robot transport devices from the first Star Wars prequel. Does the movie accomplish new goals with old material. I don't think so. Several references within script are made that mention the paranoia of the character and his unbalanced psyche. Not enough is done with this. We never think he's paranoid because we see all of the action happening. A great sense of suspense and question of reality could have been drawn if perhaps they had worked the concepts a little differently. I like the idea that the experiences Spooner (Smith's character) is having (or believes he is having) are seen by the audience as the dreams Sonny is having. Or something like that. I mean the man who wrote A Beatiful Mind, and sold that story and its twists so amazingly, worked on the script for I, Robot. A betterproduct should have come out.  Who is this Sonny? The robot that is unique. With a voice that sounds alot like Hal 9000 from 2001: Space Odessey, he is the best character put forth by the movie. Perhaps the only character, other than the cat that appears briefly, for which Ireally cared about. For me, it is a telling sign of the success of the movie what kind of bond the characters create with the audience. That is lacking for this movie. Although, a Will Smith shower scene did create a bond of a sort for my mother as she watched the movie in the next seat over.   The Good: the cinematography, the roller coaster ride of camera shots, Smith actually put forward a decent acting job for this movie but there must have been something else...something more focused missing from the concept of the movie and the script that came out. Plus, I liked Spooner's interest in antique items from the turn of the 21st century era. Chucks, CD's, a motorcycle that runs on *gasp* gasoline. MoreGood: It was an excellent sell for an action flick. The action was well-handled, the camera work with the action was exciting, and the references to The Matrix that I kept seeingwere kindofentertaining. I usually enjoy self referencing cinema or homages put into a movie...except when they replace the movie itself.  The Bad: my hubby had problems with the computer graphic/human actor integration. He cites the scene where Spooner is running through rows of robots in storage and doesnt physically react to the confines of that environment. It's like he doesnt know he running through narrow spaces. Plus, there is a time when the female lead who plays a brilliant robot scientist is circling a chair in which Sonny is sitting and there are cords on the ground...my hubby noted that she didnt step over anything...just walked around in a circle. It seems the director didnt tell these actors what was in the environments they were working with in blue screen, or at least he didnt instruct them to react to it. More bad: who was the young street punk kid, and why is he important? 2035??? Come on people...that's not that far away! It seems a little far fetched to set it so close to our current time with all of the technological advances that were shown as having beenmade.   The Ugly:the utterlack of creativity that went into this movie.And an ending that backs away from bringing any further information or ideas into the concept of the movie.  Overall:This movie is still watchable and my mother enjoyed it despite its downfalls. So, there is certainly a percentage of the movie audience that will get a kick out of it.I thoughtI, Robotwas better than I expected, but still not great. And when it comes down to it, there is little resemblance of the movie to Asimov's work. I think they just borrowed the characters. This is a matinee flick, with popcorn and a drink. Catch it in the theatres if you are into sci fi at all, but you can wait for it on video if its not your usual genre of choice.  That's all the news in fits of print -   Mack B.
