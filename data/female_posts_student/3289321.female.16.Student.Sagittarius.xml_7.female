First off, I overslept, had to rush around to get ready for school, most likely failed my exam once i got there, AND had to go with Mom to gastonia to get her car fixed.  But oh man, after all that happened, everything improved:  1. The sky got un-cloudy and the sun came out :) 2. I realized that I don't have to go to school tomorrow. 3. Dad got back from out-of-town. 4. I got to listen to my favorite CD and sing at the top of my lungs all the way home from gastonia. 5. I realized that things could be so much worse!!  God has been so good to me for 16 whole years..and it gets better every day. :):):)   Lyrics of the Moment:  "Echo" - Trapt  I think about your face And how I fall into your eyes The outline that I trace Around the one that I call mine Time that called for space Unclear where you drew the line I don't need to solve this case And I don't need to look behind  Close my eyes Let the whole thing pass me by There is no time To waste asking why  So I'll run away with you by my side I need to let go of this pride Until this echo in my mind  Before this echo can subside Do I expect to change The past I hold inside With all the words I say Repeating over in my mind Some things you can't erase No matter how hard you try An exit to escape Is all there is left to find    Later  >
