Mel 'n' Beth are picking me up in about 5 min, to go to the pre-party. Gosh! It sounds like a formal! If only we had a post party, then a post post party. It is just gonna b my group tho. We r ordering pizza at school. It is spozed to be for the pplz in our group who r actually in it (ie. every1 but me) but i am going n e way. Ehxcellent. Lol. My friend Ellen, was sure she was gonna b asked to the formal last night, and she had her dress picked out and her shoes and her bag, and when she saw Callum...he didnt ask her. But he will. He sed to keep November 20th free. That is the night of the Knox formal! N e ways, i beta go wait out the front for Mel. N e 1 who is doing nothing tonight, come to Rosevile College Hall at 7:00pm. Gold coin entry, and u will get to see all my wonderful talented friends perform! Cya round, Cheers, Ciao!, Sayonara, Blogging off, CM.
