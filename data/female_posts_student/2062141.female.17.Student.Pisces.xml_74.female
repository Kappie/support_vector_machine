I had a dream last night about someone that left me and i kept asking him is this real? and i really believed it was... i was actually thinking about how great it was that it wasn't a dream this time. then when it was just about to get good, i suddenly realized... wait this is a dream... and i woke up. I haven't felt like myself lately. Why does everyone find it neccessary to hurt me? What did I ever do to any of them? Why do I let people walk all over my trusting face. And I'll never learn. Like how I was just going to take back something I wrote earlier about how I wasn't gonna waste my time on certain people anymore... but why the hell would I do that? And I say these things but nothing ever changes... I'll still go out of my way to be nice to these people, and smile and act like nothing's wrong. I frustrate myself. So much. All I want is for them to tell me why. That's all I want. I don't want things how they were, quite the contrary. I just want to know why. I never do anything to anyone else that ever constitutes what they do to me. Oh well...dinner's ready...
