Ok, back to the topic. I  love  bitch blogs! Haha! Well, but bitching about general stuff that is, not about someone specific, dissing etc. [which I am guilty of actually, but I've learnt how to forgive. =]  "Forgiveness is like fragrance the violet sheds, on the heel that had crushed it." One of my favorite quotes by one of my favorite authors - Mark Twain.  Top 3 Bitch Blogs 1.  urlLink Maddox  [bastard, in this case] 2.  urlLink Xiaxue  3.  urlLink Stephanie Yong !  .. and steph yong's new bitch blog is my new found love! Haha! I love it! Here's a bit of her. Haha!  "And isn't it annoying when you're asking someone a question, and he or she takes a century to answer? I have a friend who took 4 hours to reply me and when I asked her what she was doing, she said:  "Oh I was taking a nap. I also closed the chat window by accident. Repeat the question please?"  OMFG GO TO HELL PLEASE."
