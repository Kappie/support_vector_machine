(no, i'm not speaking in third person: my next-door neighbor's name is kattie)  Tomorrow after band camp I'm going to the 8th grade orientation withher (she's a year younger than I). The poor thing doesn't even know how to get to the lunchroom in the high school. I've been appointed navigator. I don't mind although it does mean I'll end up going to two orientations. Quite the opposite ofRick who said he wasn't even going to his own.     Yay, Jennifer's leaving to go home. I really wish she wasn't over here so much.     He he, I've been so lazy this weekend. I've loved it so far, but I doubt I'll feel the same way come Monday.  *sighs* And every day you see me, you ask what is the matter. You want to know why I seem so irritated, so distant. I haven't the courage to tell you that it's  you.
