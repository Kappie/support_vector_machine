All because someone feels as if I play a game with their mind, so they go and TRY to play a game with me and try to hurt me to show me whatever. Well what the heck? If I even do, I don't try to. And I said I was done and we could just stop talking, well when I say that, he wants to keep talking. But if I want to talk, he is a ass. Oh yay, I just got a txt message, It says his feelings are, He's been stepped on, shook-up, nervous, let down, mournful, bitter, heartbroken, and when I feel all that I should let him know I am wrong. The he says ...Love you. I can't even believe he loves me with what he says.   Anyways, I think I'm seeing more clear about Thomas. At least I hope because I like what I see and it's not complicated it's just happy.  Next week I think I'm getting a job at Garfields, then I will get to work with Shara, that will be so much fun!   I'm about to give up on web design, it's fun but confusing sort of and I get frustrated with it all. haha   Gosh  Angelina Jolie is perfect . lol Well, goodnight everyone! Aloha
