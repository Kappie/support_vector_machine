It's much more fun to just watch the DVD from the couch while eating ice cream.  Well, a lot of you know that I gave up tv for lent.  Not the best idea seeing as I don't have time (or use the time I have) to pick up the newspaper.  It has led to comments such as:                "Hey, did you see the preview for that--" "No."               "What?  Rosie O'Donnell came out?"               "What do you mean hot spots?"               "What NCAA tournament?"  So for the next two weeks, quit askin be if I saw this or watched that or if I want to come over and watch Dawson's Creek (sadist bitches.)  And don't you dare offer me cheese to compensate!!
