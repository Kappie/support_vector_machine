VBS was smelly, tiring, funny, etc. I'm just tired of trying to make kids listen and behave. i also need to figure out a way for them to stop touching me..i do not like being touched by them. i'm not exactly a touchy-feely person to begin with, but then they are dirty and i don't like some of them. plus they   smell. really bad.   so i was wearing neato socks also. i love socks when they are cool but i actually hate them because my feet get disgusting, as if feet aren't gross enough without being sweaty. ew i'm grossing myself out with this talk of feet. so after VBS we went to burger king (betsy meggie hannah and myself) and brian plushkis was working so we talked to him. it was exciting. i hadn't seen him in ages. i'm not sure he even knows me. oh well. he might go to betsy's birthday and that is really good. thats gonna be one good party. i'm so tired right now i'm almost asleep on the keyboard. it is 1:42 in the afternoon. i am the lamest of the lame.
