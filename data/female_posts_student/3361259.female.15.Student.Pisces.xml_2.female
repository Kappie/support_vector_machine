Never knew the little children could be so annoying. The only good part of it all is when me and jenn scare that one boy into believing that we're actually in love with him. lmao. Yeah so I got a 71 on my bible essay which is really gay. That man doesnt know good shit when he sees it. Guess I wasted that saturday for nothing. So stupid. I wish I could just drop the class altogether. but whatever. All I want to do right now is crawl into my bed. Things just seem to be getting worse and worse. Oh well.Only 17 more day till Prisoner of Azkaban comes out. I cant wait. Im probably going to go see it with Jenn. Loads and loads of fun!!! That is if I actually have any money to go. :S i really really neeed a job. Anyone got one for me?? :S Im not really looking forward to see Fat Man (old prinicpal) at market in the summer time. The whole staring and telling me to smile thing sickens me.I dont think i'll ever hate anyone as much as I hate that man.I have yet to decide which is worse is looks or personality.
