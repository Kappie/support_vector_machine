My grade eight commencement took place June 25, 2004, and I am looking forward to attending Forest Heights Institute in the coming fall. At this turning point in my school career, I would like to reflect on those who have affected me most, and show them the respect they deserve. 	 My year at Queensmount Public School as been amazing, and own it to all of you. I have been given incredible opportunities I never imagined I’d been able to receive, as well as strong support from friends, peers, family, and teachers alike. The first of these opportunities would be the privilege to be moved from seventh to eighth grade. I owe my success in my new grade all to the teachers and staff of Queensmount. Without their hard work and backing, I would have never made it.  	 I would like to recognize a handful of people close to my heart that have influenced me in the past few years. First in foremost, is Jesus Christ, who I find all of my strength. Though I may not have acknowledged it, he had held my hand though the years, leading me to Canada, and eventually my Church, the Father’s House. Second, would be my parents. Over the past year especially, I have become closer to my parents than I think I ever have been. I have been able to go father than I ever thought possible because they stood behind me.  	 Over the past few years, many teachers that have entered and left my life and have made a profound impact on my outlook and understanding of myself, my talents, and the world around me. The earliest teacher to impact me in this way was my forth grade teacher, Mr. Tim Wilkinson.  	 It was November 2000, and I was living with my Grandmother in the small town of Stanton, Michigan when I entered Mr. Wilkinson’s class. During the six months I was in his forth grade class, Mr. Wilkinson showed me that I had value in the community, and, if I tried, would have value in the world. 	 	 In grade six, I had the privilege to be taught by Miss. Nancy Buckland. From the moment I met her, I could tell that she was in teaching not for herself, but for the children. When she entered the room, her joy would lighten the atmosphere, and affected everyone around her in a positive way. She was an advocate for peace, always took the time to talk to her students, and was dedicated to the well-being on those around her. Though her life was tragically cut short on December 19, 2003, her spirit lives on in everyone who knew her. Thank you for generously giving your life for the benefit of those around you.  	 A year later, at Queensmount public school, I would again be affected by caring and dedicated teachers. The first of these would be Mr. Gary Fairmen. Mr. Fairmen is one of the most caring people I have ever met. His skills as a guidance counsellor are unsurpassed. In my case, Mr. Fairmen spent hours of his time listing to me and helping me in any way he could. He was the one who made it possible for me move to grade eight. He specifically asked that I was placed in his home room so that he could continue to help me toward my goals. Though Mr. Fairmen is now leaving Queensmount to retire, we will remember him always. With sincere gratitude, I thank you for all your hard work.   	 In my new grade, I encountered a Mr. Ron House. In the first few months of my new grade, I disliked my new Math and English teacher, and had no problem making it known to him. What intrigued me about him was that my rebellion had no effect on him. I remember him telling the class that he was not going to hound us to take our work more seriously, but he would always be there if we wanted his help. This really caught my attention.  	 From that point on, I worked closely with him, as well as Mr. Burt Snow, to improve my grades, and in the end, gained two fantastic mentors that I will never forget. Thank you for your profound influence in my work, especially writing. I appreciate your interest, and will always remember you. Though both Mr. House and I are moving on (Mr. House is retiring), I hope that we will stay in contact. 	 My eighth grade science teacher, Mr. Kevin Reid, affected me in more subtle way. For the first time in years, Mr. Reid made learning fun for me. He is among the best teachers I have ever had because of his devotion to his students, as well as his ability to make us laugh in the toughest of situations. In his class, I was able to open up and be myself without being worried. Mr. Reid took an interest in his students and went out of his way to make me feel welcome in his class. Thank you for being such a fantastic teacher!  		 Over the past few months, many people outside school have touched my life. My friends have been played a pivotal role in my life. I would like to thank my extended family in the Father’s House for supporting me in hardships and struggles. You had faith in me, and though I let you down, you never left my side. Thank you for letting me have the privilege of being a part of your lives.  	 Also, I would like to thank my friends, Jessica Kyle, Mark Urban, Scott Huff, Misha Sgro, and Johnny Oliveira. Though we had a short time together in grade eight, I look forward to strengthening our new relationships. Thank you for being there to cheer me up, to help me see the truth in things, and, in some cases, being there to tell me I’m off.    	 Though the time has come for me to move on, I will always treasure the lessons you have all taught me. I find it very hard to express my appreciation for all the hard work and time you have put into helping me. Thank you sincerely for your love and support over the past years.    		 			Respectfully yours,   					Amber Hadley
