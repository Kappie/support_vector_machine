I got woken up this morning at 530 because an unknown someone was textmessaging me. There is something i have to say to that person, I dont love you there is no way i can. you have hurt me,annoyed my friends,and cheated. you are not worthy. as for putting me down for the past few months, this is pay back. You always made fun of me for going to ums but ya know something not everyone there is stuck up , i think you are more stuck up then half the people there, so when you talk crap make sure its straight. you are lame , and i dont care who you date or are with so dont bother wasting your time telling me. you waste your breath and energy everytime you talk to me. leave me alone, stop calling me and text messaging me. But enough bashing. I have something to say to another certian someone named Lee. Ya'll dont understand how much Lee means to me. I just wanted to say thanks to him since he has been there for me and has never missed a chance to make me feel better, so Lee thanks alot I Love You so much big bro! and to Jon thanks for making me feel better when i was down and always listening to me and talking to me at camp when you didnt have too! hahah! your a sweet and BUFF guy i wish you the best of luck durning your senior year ROLL TIDE! as for street racers that race down cottagehill road at night STOP IT race somewhere else. I know this has sounded like a huge complaint but yall are reading my thoughts so get over it. oh and to chris ballard, im going to miss you while your at boot camp! good luck! i love you soo much baldy!! haha! dont forget your lotion while your there! i dont mean for this blog to be a complaining blog i jus have alot to say. But anyways, on a more happier note i went to six flags today it was a blast- happy birthday miller - we all had fun playing the name game but anyways this post is really long good night for now  Lindsay
