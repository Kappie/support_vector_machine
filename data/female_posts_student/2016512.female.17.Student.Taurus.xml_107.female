It was really nice out. I'm outta shape, but i'm proud to go against all professional ballet trainers thoughts and run. bum bum bum! "i'll never be accepted into the company." oh well i can always be a street performer. yes that would go over nicely.  my minds been going a mile a minute lately. it kind of sucks to be alone with your thoughts especially when it turns you into an insomniac. i miss Lily already but i'm sure she'll have fun on her globe trotting adventures. diddo to the no-longer-foreign-exchange-student Anik. I'm proud of her. She survived Ox Cart Country for a year. She's got guts.  I feel like getting a 9-5 job. i mean everyone else is doing it, why not join the band wagon. i figure i won't have many people to hang out with during the day. my job only seems to last about 2 hours at a time, so i'm free. *sigh* i feel like running again...  56 Spanish Llamas, -Betso
