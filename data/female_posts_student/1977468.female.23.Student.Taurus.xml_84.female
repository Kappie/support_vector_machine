What I did for Valentine's day    Thou hast leveled to level 11 deep in durlong's tower, a paladin fights for goodness across this cold world it could not be so, had I a girl  SLay the bastards! In a glory devine! 161,000 xp will soon be mine! I fight for love in these halls of peril A love I must myself deny  For women know not the ways of danger save, exept, that dual-weilding ranger she fights just as I.. and she is a girl. Though deep down inside, I know she's not real.  And all we are? Pixels in the wind... Pixels.. in the wind.. Dust.. on the screen    Thats not all I did on valentine's day though. I trimmed my armpit hair... I also massaged my scalp. My hair lady said I'm thinning on the top of my head. I know. I'm going bald. Whats next, prostate cancer? I'm not going to fight it. It's time to lye down and die. I had a good run. I mean, I've never been in love. It's hard to believe some people die as virgins, but you know, there is a peace in ignorance, there is a peace in not knowing what you missed.
