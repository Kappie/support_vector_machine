I feel independent.  For once I did something right the first time.  Though it took my 3 tries to get my parallel perfect.  The first time I was too far, the 2nd I was too close and I hit the curb so I lost some points there, and the last time it was perfect.  I didn't even have time to merge because it took forever to parallel but I still passed and I only got 40 points deducted.  Tonight I get to go out for Chinese!!!!  OMG that is all I have been doing - EATING!!  But whatever, I look good and besides I am on top of the world right now.  Passed my test and pretty sure I made Distinction, hmmm not much more I want cept a good mark on the next Bio test!  LOL!
