So at 3 the people from Louisiana came over for the cook out. All the kids swam while the adults talked and cooked. We then ate at like 5, and I was so hungry. We all talked and just had a lot of laughs, and then we swam again. I dried off with and Ashton and me rode the golfcart around the yard. I did these doughnuts around the yard, and then Ashton did one and the golfcart about flipped. Very scary but fun!! Then it was time for everyone to leave and I then asked if Ashton could stay. I didn't even need to ask everyone just said yeah whatever. So I drove Ashton to her pop's house and she got some clothes and then I drove back over to my house. And after watching Viva La Bam and listening to music here i am writing on the Blog. So that was my fun filled day!!
