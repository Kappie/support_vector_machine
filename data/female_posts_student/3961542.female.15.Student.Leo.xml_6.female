I mean, i havent fallen out with the un-named person *coughs* peewee, its just that he really started to piss me off, and spoke to me as if it was all my fault.          [edit]Ok, ive realised what i put is wrong,cos it was a spur of the moment kinda thing which i didntmean.     So all ive got to say to you peewee dearie is:     Im sorry,     Im sorry,     Im sorry,     Im sorry.......and loads more of that (but i just cant be bothered to type it)     XxXx         [edit] im feeling happier now that i have calmed down.All is well again.          urlLink      Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
