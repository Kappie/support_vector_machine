I am sure that someone I talk to will be in my lunch so I dont think that I have anything to worry about... same with classes I only have 2 with Mandy and like 3 with Britt... but oh well... I am really surprised that I am not freaking out over here... I am in shock... but I'm fine with it... um... what else... My mom wont let me do Cross Country... but I'm not going to get into that because I will get angry... um... I got an athletic pass for this year... that will be nice for games and stuff... um... thats really it...   We took Sumathy to the train station today... wow... that place is really creepy... but interesting... erp... I am glad I didnt have to ride on there... but I am sure that Sumathy made it home just fine... she should be there by now... her train left at like 10 after 5... Britt and James are coming over soon... we are going to have a little kill bill fest it should be a good time... blah... other than the fact that I am feeling really sick... grr... I hate feeling like complete and total crap!!! my stomach hurts and my head aches... I just cant wait to sleep in my own bed tonight because Sumathy and I were sleeping on my mom's bed for the past 3 nights and it sucks... sucks... I hate it... and the pillows are way too fluffy for me... I like my flat and worn... haha... erp... well I feel like I am going to vomit so I should probably go... 2 days until my birthday but it doesnt feel that way... it feels like its just another friday of doing nothing... crap... I was supposed to call impressions today to see how much my hair coloring will be and see if I even want to do it anymore... I dont know... V told me that she loves the color that I just dyed it so I dont know if I should change it... we'll see how I feel about it tomorrow...   byes   -gabby   Here's my schedule...
