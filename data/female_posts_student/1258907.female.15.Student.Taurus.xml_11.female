All these years of being me I remember laying in bed 5 years ago I cannot believe what I see  Look at me, so naive I slept in that perfect bed Is that really how it used to be?  Is it all what I used to believe? I'd slept in that perfect bed Dreaming of my very own "Prince Ali"  Thinking of the person I would become I'd lay in that perfect bed I never thought I'd be this dumb  Sitting here and counting  lamb  I lay on this imperfect bed And realize that this is who I am.
