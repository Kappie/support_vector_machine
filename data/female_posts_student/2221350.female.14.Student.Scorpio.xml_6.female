Without it, the day seems amiss, as though not publishing it makes it a void space.   Nothing exciting happened yesterday. i said my monologue again and did better than a couple other people again. Why do they get so nervous? I wouldn't consider myself someone born for the stage, but what is such a huge deal that some of the poor darlings can't even get past the first line? Eh.  The rest of the day is kind of a blur, I got a bad sinus headache in French, so I knocked back a couple sudophedrine((NOT an easy thing to do with nothing but spit)) and came home and slept. Then tiffany called and invited me bowling. Yah.  Today was basically the same as yesterday except that Emily and I decided Ms. Hughes is not the sweet, oblivious, reefer old lady she pretends to be, but rather a passive aggressive battle-ax who notices our slacking, talking, skipping, copying, but rather than stopping us she just sabotages our grade. I don't exactly know how me came to this conclusion, but it sounds pretty good don't you think?  We have a new teacher in French. Well she's not really a new teacher, she's learning how to teach and we are her guinea pigs. The real teacher sits in the back of class and kind of helps out. But i like the new lady, her methods are better and she got rid of that stupid notebook check at the end of the nine weeks.  Mom won't be home tonight. I really don't mind though, she's been driving me nuts the last couple nights. She says she hasn't been drinking, but she acts like an idiot.   Can't wait to go bowling this weekend, I had a blast last time.   OK, so they make this stuff now called -diet coke with lime- and it is the BEST diet coke I have ever had. It's like... YEAH! Mammaw went to the "top o' the hill"((gas station)) to get cigs and she's gonna bring me one!!! YAY  I'm trying out this band called Flogging Molly, it's weird. They are like punk/rock/Irish folk singers. I've gotta put some of this shitt up here:  So, did you like that?  Everybody needs to watch American Idol. I wasn't into it the last two seasons, but I've been watching the auditions and they are hilarious! I mean, do these people honestly thing they can sing? Or are they just there to be on tv? ch-yeah.  Let me say this: someone told me they loved me today and it made me absolutely threeled. I love everyone who reads this blog, and if you don't read it, I still love you!!! ((except you suck))  Might Post Later.
