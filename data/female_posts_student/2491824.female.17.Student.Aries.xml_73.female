(If you have no idea what I am talking about, then you obviously have not read all of the post titled "Nightmares rock!" which is eleven posts below this one.)  It is just so random and makes no sense. Hehe, I love it!  ..example of future uses:  --"Holy shit, Ashley! (Insert catastrophe/calamity) has just happened! What do you think we should do?! --"Hm, I don't know, but, 'The demon is in the china!'"  --"Oh, wow. Well, I never considered it from that point of view."  ...See! It could be revolutionary!  ...I'm a genius!....
