Plus my mom and I are getting along again, and i love that.  Stephen is doing so much better now that he has a job.  I can enjoy living with him now.  Just my whole life is so much better and it doesnt matter what those people think.  Well today i got an account to where i am able to have an atm card, which is so cool, because  i can spend my money as i please.  thank you EECU.  now i dont have to  carry all my cash on me, which scares me to death.   Just a note to my oakridge friends and Mark with the hat, Thank you for being kind and caring.  I know you all are nice. And Leah and Justin, you two, yall are the best friends i have right now.  thanks  well now time to go earn money and babysit, so im out.
