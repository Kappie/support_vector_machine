I'm a chick not a DUDE...cars are not my thing..not in Ottawa at least! It's funny...when guys are mad, they'll go off on you for like an hour and try and say "I didn't mean anything I said" yeahhhhhh...nice try.  So I don't know what's up with that right now.  Oh well, what can I say, I'm sure it's my fault.  Anyways, I know none of you want to hear about my love life...  !!--!! >>  Haylee, *my lil sister* is leaving on June 25th to go to Georgia for like 3 or 4 weeks...what a bitch!!  If only MISS COURTNEY could get out of this skanky town for a month, must be nice! My aunt says "You can come during christmas"--Well first of all Christmas? I wouldn't get as many presents, I would only be able to come for like 2 weeks, and I'd miss all my family christmas stuff...You can't always have your way I guess.   Tonight I have another reception to go to...which I doubt I'll go-depends on what  HE'S  doing.  I'm at work now, as usual...I'll probably leave @ 12 when Brent gets here.  I work tomorrow, too... 10-5.  How fun.  I'll write more later...or maybe I'll put some PICS up!   Courtney
