I told him to call me when he felt like talking to me and still hasnt done so.  To be honest im relly starting to not even care anymore.  Its really fucking gay that he gets so pissed off and so defensive every time i try telling him how i feel.  Its ridiculous actually.  This is all really too bad because i really did like him and i know hes a great person.  Not to mention the sex was really good!  I just wish that he was willing to put even a small amount of effort into our relationship.  I think its pretty stupid to think that you can go your whole life assuming everything is supposed to be so easy and effortless.  But i guess if thats what hes thinking, thats his own problem. I think i will call him and find out what the hell is going on.  Im really starting to get fed up with not having a job and being broke ALL the time.  I hate living on freaking pop cans..  I will be appealing the decision of the medicaid.  I hope to God it doesnt take as long as it did the first time!  Like ive said before.. i just want my life back and be able to do the things i used to or the things i want to do.  smoking status: quit
