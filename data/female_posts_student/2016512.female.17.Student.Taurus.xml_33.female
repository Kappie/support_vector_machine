This one's just suffering the correct ratio, thank you very much. However, Manda has so "subtley" (subtly?...I could check, but I won't) reminded us that we are horrible human beings who have left this poor unfortunate collection of thoughts go unloved. Or that we, in fact, forget its existence. Or that we have other priorities. Whatever. In any case, I am scum. I am the bacteria on the scum. I am the amoeba of the bacteria on the scum. I am the nucleus of the amoeba of the bacteria on the scum. I am the...ok, I'm done breaking down scum anatomy.  Anywhore, heya blog. How've ya been? I'm peachy. I'm going to Bagley tomorrow. Really blog? You haven't been to Bagley? You really should. The sun, the sand, the surf *chuckle*, it's all good. I'll take you there sometime. You know what, blog? There're some good lookin' male specimens there. I don't know your preference, but hey, maybe those good lookin' specimens have some equally good lookin' blogs. What d'ya think? A double date? We can "log on" together. *suggestive wink* Do blogs have genders? Does it matter? Let's make a night of it. I'll be in touch.  So that's my two cents for the evening. Hope it was to your fancy, fellow bloggites.  "Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows."
