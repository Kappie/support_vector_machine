I have been getting tired of writing my wacky song parodies about food (I've been doing it for almost 25 years now!) and was getting burned out. Then I discovered this wonderful site called "Dear Susan". So now I've decided to devote my sardonic songwriting skills to penning parodies about the pariah named Susan. I'll be posting bits and pieces of works in progress on here from time to time for your perusal and enjoyment. Here's two very rough parodies I've been working on lately. Best Regards!  Ass Junkie (to the tune of  the Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey”)  Ass Junkie Your trunk is funky And skunky, drunkie You’re such a flunky Your ass has a stench that’s so unreal    You’re an Ass Junkie but that's how you deal Put your left leg down your right leg up Tilt your head back and guzzle my spunk Your Dad with the bottle, King rocks your can Susan gives ass to every man...   Cum Where You Will (to the tune of Nirvana’s “Come As You Are”)  Cum where you will In my ass On my grill Where you want Take your fill Fuck my cunt Or my rump  Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah Spread my cheeeeeks, yeah  And I swear that I don’t have the HIV No, I don’t have the HIV...
