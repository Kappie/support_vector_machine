Powergrid Fitness is coming out with the Kilowatt Game Controller late this spring, and it aims to turn your body into a fit, toned joystick.    Sensors in the ski machine-like device measure the force of your movements which are translated into game actions.  You won't even have to move too much, as this is isometric exercise which means you exert your muscles without using your joints. Yeah I don't know what that means either, maybe it's kind of like Pilates. PowerGrid assures that you will feel the burn, however, and the demo users in  urlLink Powergrid's funny infomercial-style plugs  appear to be sweating from their efforts while not discernibly doing anything at all.    The Kilowatt will be compatible with Playstation2, Xbox, and Nintendo Gamecube. Water and towels not included.  Just one question- is the world ready for gamers with muscles? If this takes off, be prepared for global "Revenge of the Nerds".    Pre-orders are now being accepted now at  urlLink  Powergrid Fitness.
