It was cool, I've never really seen them up close. One lit up in my hand-i love the little things.Later we met up in this little diner with my Aunt Kathy, Conor, and Ryan. Then we went bowling. The first time we played I won with a 98! Then my sister got a little competitive and then she won by one point. I had a score of 102(hey I guess I should mention we had the little gutter liners :) ) ha ha.    Later on this week we plan on going into the city, Six Flags, The boardwalk, and then of course the reason why we came- the family reunion...i wonder if anybody will be able to guess who I am. I'm at Beth's house right now, earlier Uncle Tom, Darren and Clare, and Uncle John were here. This is going to be short-  Au revoir.
