I loved the part in the book when this ram had this tenacity to climb this mountain and Grendel would try to knock it down. The ram reminds me of my more determined friends. Grendel, the character himself, reminds me of my friend Albert.     My friend Amy rented  Holy Smoke  on VHS. (She still has no desire to buy a DVD player.) Strange flick. Harvey Keitel in drag is just a weird image. Keitel plays P.J. an exit counselor who tries to deprogram Kate Winslet who believes she found love and enlightenment from Bubba, an East Indian guru. Amy made the best buttered popcorn--this side of Solano County.    I'm gonna take a leave of absence in the blogging for a while. This is the last week to get ready for my sis' big day, and I have to supplement my income to pay off my student loan and the mound of bills. Grrrrrr. [hums] Job hunting I will go..job hunting I will go...hi ho...merry-oh...job hunting I will go.
