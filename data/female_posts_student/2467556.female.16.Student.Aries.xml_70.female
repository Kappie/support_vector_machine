I hated the fact that my face felt all nasty all day even though people told me that it looked normal.....i dunno, i think its the climate change.    I found Mr. Masengill's room today! Now i can skip class and visit him!  Did i mention that yesterday me and my mom were rebels and we went out for brunch after my dentist appointment?  I got cheese fries, it rocked.  I missed first and second period!!  Oh man, have you ever had that feeling that you miss someone alot but they're like, right there in front of you.  All of the sudden its like you weren't as close as you used to be and you missed that?  Maybe this is a repercussion of school and tiredness and thats why everyone's acting so different.    PLAYOFFS START TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO COWBOYS, SECOND TITLE LETS DO THIS!!!!!!  19 days until my birthday!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
