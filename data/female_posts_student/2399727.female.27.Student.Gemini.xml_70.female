The turnout by both the volunteers and the hungry was actually pretty pathetic.  There were tons more people last week and the uni. was on the verge of closing.  Oh well.  It is hard to explain what it was doing out there this afternoon.  The best description I could come up with was it was raining little snowballs.  Such a mix that you ended up soaked right through your clothes, but it wasn't unpleasant.  The temperature and the precipitation.  Usually I find soaking clothes unpleasant as a rule.  Time for another trip home.  Must pack and do something useful before I leave.  More to come...
