I feel like it's a big milestone, and I should feel some emotion...happy that the years ending, sad that the years ending, I don't know, but for some reason I just don't feel anything. I hope I'm not becoming emotionless, that would suck. Maybe it hasn't fully sunk in yet. This year has been so weird in so many ways. I'm not really sure what I thought of it. This past week has surely been fun though, if only the whole year was like it...I would definitely have some emotion.  What I am sure of, is that I love this song. "Your Song" (the Moulin Rouge version)... I just cannot get sick of it.  I am also sure that I am now officially sick of chocolate cake, that Finding Nemo rocks, that film festivals are cool, and that candy necklaces (won from getting 1st place in the APUSH game...hell yeah) are better to look at than eat.
