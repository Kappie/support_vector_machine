A good start is vBulletin (www.vbulletin.com) Ah my site, weel my domain is a .com and was £20 a year (but .nu's are about £30 a year) and hosting with  urlLink UK Alive  is just £30 a year! (U get rubbish bandwidth though ;() There you ahev it, a site from £50 (I paid £110 with vBulletin on top of my want list.)  Remember, I'm always available for DNS help, Domains, HTML etc   I have a greta idea! Go to  urlLink I can give you a free board!  It will be a private forum on mine (U guys will olny have access) and you can chat about what you like, with no interenference! Cool huh, check it out! Reply if your interested. (Its free) on my server, fast and no banner ads or popups. Enjoy XD  (NOTE: Vinnie close your tags!)
