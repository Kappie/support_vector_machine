I also had the pleasant task of changing all these 700 pictures into thumbnails, by cropping, changing image sizes and making it brown. I atleast got another chance to relax and go to Costco and see A Cinderella Story, which was cute. It was a good time and then I came back and had an even funner time making....wait for it....more thumbnails, and I am not even close to beeing finished. So yeah, that was my day/night, and I'll be back tonight to write about today...although I think I can give you a preview now....        THUMBNAILS        Lata xx
