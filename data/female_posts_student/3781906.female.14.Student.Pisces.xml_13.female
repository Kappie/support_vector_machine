The time he had spent with the girl, the more he felt himself fall in love with her.  Grace was confusing. She teased him with her body. “Only if I know you are fully mine.” She had said. He would half to give up all the other girls in his life. Two weeks ago, he turned her down, but now, he doubted his decision. He wanted her, and he was just about willing to do anything to get her.  There was no denying… Levi loved Grace. He has spent two weeks by her side almost constantly. She was kind… caring… All she really needed was the same.  He had found what he twice thought he had with Jenna. He had found someone who was sincere; a genuine person. She had no other agenda on their mind, other to get to know Levi better. It was her most attractive aspect.   The clock chimed. It was 1:00 in the morning, and Ben still was not home from Katie’s house. Levi could hear his parents quietly bickering in the kitchen, trying not to wake the children. Glossy-eyed, he stared at his reflection in the mirror. He was a mess. A combination of blood from his cuts on his body and dirt his bike had kicked up when he was riding earlier covered him from head to toe.    Levi stood from where he was lying in bed and ran his hand though his spiked hair. He took a deep breath and walked over to his closet. There was no use sitting at home when he could be out on the town. He flung the heavy doors open and randomly selected an outfit. It was black jeans and a t-shirt, with silver seams.  He slipped them on gingerly and made his way down the stairs.   * * * * * * * * * 	 Grace lay in a restless sleep in her large bed. The moon shined blue though the windows, giving her pale skin an eerie blue colouring.   Jason voice echoed though her dreams. "Oh, come on Grace! Loosen up. You love me don't you?" She shivered as wind blew in from the cracks in the floorboards.  The memories and the pain of the night six weeks before flashed though her head, making her shake uncontrollably. Her body ached as she tossed and turned, then finally; she sat up and looked around the room.  She sighed in relief and pulled the blankets up around her chilled body and laid back down as she realised she was alone. Tears ran warmly down her icy cheeks as she stared blankly out her bedroom window and into the full moon.  “Gracie… Gracie…” She heard a voice whisper forcefully from a crossed the room. Her eyes widened and her heart raced. She shook in fright daring not turn toward her bedroom door. It was him…  Grace heard the footsteps of the intruder on the hardwood floor become louder. “Grace.” The voice whispered again, this time louder. She felt a hand touch her shoulder and turn her over.  “Oh my god! Levi!” she reached upward toward him and held him closely. Levi croaked quietly. “Grace… Grace… Hush my love…” He looked at her and felt like crying.  She looked pale, her face streaked with tears. “What’s wrong?” “I’m fine. Just been watching…” She turned her head toward the window and pointed. She looked at him as if she was going to cry, then gave a fake laugh.  Levi pulled her closely to his chest, but reeled in pain and pulled away. “Stop… please! Grace… Wait.” Shock covered Grace’s face. Did she suspect something?   “What? Baby, are you okay? I’m sorry…I get you in the eye or something?” She giggled sweetly and pulled him back in to her. “No… I’m fine… Please… Just stop.” She let him go and sat up. Her caramel brown eyes where red with tears. Shaking, she took his hand. Levi cringed, but tried to hide it. Grace eyed Levi carefully. She ran her thin fingers back and forth a crossed his arms, stroking them and watching for his reaction.  “What are you doing?” “Grace. Stop.” He whispered. “I don’t want you to see me like this.” “Are you hurting yourself?” Levi was stared at her silently. “Levi… Answer me.” Grace’s voice wavered and she began to cry again. “Oh Grace, don’t cry! I’ll be okay. I don’t want you to see me like this!” He clenched his teeth and stared at the purple-blue coloured wall.   Tears swelled up in Grace’s eyes. She was shocked that Levi, who on the outside appeared so happy, was in fact, just as depressed and lonely as she. Levi’s life was seemingly perfect. An older brother… younger siblings… Parents that loved him. She was tempted to roll up his sleeves to see the damage, but was also scared of what she might find. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. “Show me.”  Levi did not believe what he heard. “Show me Levi.” She said again. His head hung, as if he where a puppy being scolded for peeing on a newly carpeted floor. Gashes from his cutting where from his wrists up to his elbows and he knew that eventually, someone would discover them. It was bound to happen, so who better then Gracie?  She would understand what he was going though, just as he would understand her trials.  She leaned over to see as he took off his sweater and revealed his arms, scared and bruised, and in some cases, bleeding. She gasped, stared at him for a moment, and sat up straight.   “Grace, don’t worry about me. Please do not cry. Please.” “He hit me… and raped me… many… many times.” Levi looked up at Gracie, tears flowing down her cheeks. She was breathing heavily, and shaking with the memories of her past. Levi’s eyes widened as her words computed in his head. Abuse… RAPE…!  “Who… Who did this to you?” “It was my entire fault anyway. I did not make him happy… I didn’t love him enough.” “TELL ME GRACE!” Levi grabbed her arms tightly, just as Jason had a month before. She yanked away from his grip and angrily whispered, “Do not touch me… You are like him… you are ALL like him… want to hurt me… want to see me dead, don’t you! DON’T YOU!”   “Grace… Listen to me… Listen… Please… Its Levi…I am trying to help you. If I wanted to see you dead, would come to see you here every day. I would not kiss you the way I do. I would not tell you I love you more than life itself. I want to see MYSELF dead! Please!”  “Who did this to you, Grace? Tell me.” Grace refused to speak. She nudged closer to Levi, avoiding his gashed. She looked him in the eyes, and her rage subsided. “Levi, I’m sorry. I did not mean it. I know you love me. I love you. Don’t leave me.” Levi held her close, kissing her face and neck. “Oh Gracie, love me while I’m here. I’ll protect you as long as I am alive.”   Levi kissed her again and sank down into her bed. “Please do not tell anyone.” Levi looked up a half smile. “You still haven’t told me who it was. Just tell me Grace.” Grace wrapped her arms and legs around Levi’s toned body. “Jason.”   Levi’s heart raced. Jason had stolen Jenna from him and had hurt the one person he loved. A look of horror flooded Grace’s eyes and softened Levi’s anger. “It’s okay Grace. You are mine, not his. I’ll never hurt you again.” A grin covered Grace’s face. “Yes. I am fully yours.”  Levi watched Grace as she closed her eyes and relaxed. She looked beautiful in the moonlight. She was perfect.  He could not ask for anyone better. Levi felt lust come over him. He caressed Grace’s cheek tenderly as his body went numb. Grace opened her eyes and smiled.    * * * * * * * * *  Levi was disoriented for only a second when woke up. He was still with Grace. He looked over to her lying on the other side of the bed, and smiled.  He wished deeply he could stay longer, but it was almost 3:00 am.  Levi crept from the bed and picked his shirt up off the floor. He turned his head to look at Grace again. She slept peacefully, a broad smile on her face.   He dressed quickly, kissed Grace on the lips, and slipped out the door. Levi’s bike sat bathing in the cool light of the full moon. It was a beautiful night for riding, but he found himself longing to go back inside and be with Grace. His heart beat heavily just thinking of her beautiful smile.   “Nice to see you here, Mr. Kaisner.” Said a voice from behind him. Levi turned to see Jason standing behind him clad fully in black. “What are you doing here?” Levi asked angrily. “I asked you first.” Jason smiled proudly. “I was with Grace.” “And I was waiting for you.”   Levi’s face turned red. Levi had given up fight over Miss Sheraton with Jason, and now he was coming to claim Grace. He couldn’t let that happen. He had promised Grace just hours ago that he would protect her. He’d do it, even if he was killed trying.  “DAMNIT. Just leave the girl alone! Haven’t you done enough? You had your fun! I know what you’ve done to her, you sick bastard!” “Look Kaisner.” Jason’s frigid eyes bore into Levi’s, which only made him more angry.   “She my girl. I can do whatever I want to her, whenever and wherever I want! Fuck off and keep your crusty British ass out of my business.” Levi was hot with rage. How could he speak like that about Grace? He did not give a damn about her.  “You’re a bloody bastard! You can crib around and molest your other fucking prostitutes, but it will be my blood on your vile hands the day you again TOUCH GRACE!” A sudden burst of pain shot like a bullet through Levi’s head. The familiar warm feeling of blood dribbled down his cheek. He wavered but kept his ground.   “Is that I promise or a dare, Mr. Kaisner?” Levi gritted his teeth. The sickening taste of blood filled his mouth. Jabbed, kick, trip, kick, kick, jab. Jason fell to the ground in a heap. “A promise.”   “You son of a bitch! How dare you tell me what to do? What makes you think you can protect that obstinate crow?” Jason laughed coldly as he yanked him to the ground. Levi tried to see where Jason was, but could not see him. “You touch Grace, and you’ll be getting more from me, I can guarantee you that much!” Jason curled his fists in rage and spit in his face. Levi called out and threw a final blow. “Your blood on my hands.”    * * * * * * * * *  “What the HELL happened to you?” “Nothing Dad, don’t worry.” “Son…yer face is leakin’ all over me carpet. Do all yer leakin’ in the kitchen or the loo please.” Mr. Kaisner chuckled from the couch. Levi’s mother appeared from hallway, little Samuel, sleeping peacefully in her arms. The apron she wore drew attention to her swelled abdomen. “Elaine, I’ll take the lad.”  “Thank ya, Thomas. You come with yer mum, darlin’. With much shrieking and kicking, Mrs. Kaisner turned over sleeping Samuel to her husband.  “What’d those bastards do to you?” “THOMAS!” “Sorry Hun…” “Got in ta a bit of a barney…” Levi laughed. His father being scolded for a foul mouth made Levi want to roll on the floor in laugher. Levi’s mother stood in front of him with a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a ratty looking cloth. Pain gripped Levi as she gently dabbed his forehead.   “Don’t hurt that bad, I take it.” Their mother sighed. “Lads… seventeen and I’m still bandagin’ up yer wounds.” She laughed massaging her stomach. “Thanks be to Zeus if these lil’ ones are lassies. If not, curses ta yer pa!” “Is Ben alright?” She asked Levi. He shrugged. “I don’t know. I wasn’t with him.” A look a white anger flooded her face. “What are you meanin’ by that, child?” “I haven’t seen him.”   Just then, the screen door crashed open. Ben’s voice could be heard from the living room. “Where hav’ you been?” Levi father questioned Ben. “Katie’s.” “Elaine’s been worried sick.” “Like I give a shit.”  Ben burst though the kitchen door to find Elaine and Levi there. Elaine dropped her things and slapped Ben swiftly across the face. “You do NOT speak like that in my house. I have my boys to raise here!” Ben stood silently before her.   Levi watched in horror as his brother quickly raised his hand and slapped Elaine twice as hard as she had slapped him. She reeled backward in shock, eyes wide and filled with tears. “Don’t touch me. Alright?”  Seeing his brother hit Elaine, made Levi think of what Jason must had done to Grace. Horrible pictures filled his mind. “One of these day’s you’ll get that girl pregnant!” Elaine cried. “Then you’ll be sorry you’ve slept with her!” Ben looked at Elaine and chuckled. Both Elaine and Levi could smell the whisky on his breath.   “Aye, thing is, I’ve already shacked her up Mum. Just as dad shacked you up, ya whore! Too bad, you cannot keep a baby! I am a married man as of two hours ago. Congratulate me!”  Levi was shocked and frightened of his brother, which he had very been before. He had never seen Ben so violent, but in some ways he was not surprised after hearing him talk about Elaine before. He just wished he knew what to do.   “Thomas!” Elaine called out. Their father was standing in the doorway. Anger flashed over him. “Congratulations. Now get the bloody hell out of my house. You do not speak to me wife that way, nor do ya put a HAND on her! She loses ‘er babies because of you, and I swear child, it will be yer head!” Ben nodded. “Sure. I’m out.” Shoved his father out of the doorway, grabbed his things from the living room, and slammed the front door shut with such a force that the walls shook. The noise made Sam wail pitifully.  “Excuse me Thomas.” Elaine said, motioning him to move to the side. “You finish with Levi.” She walked solemnly into the living room and held Samuel in her arms. Tears filled her eyes. “Levi, leave us for a while please.”   Chapter 8: The Fib  The morning sun shined brightly though the sheer blue curtains framing the windows in Grace’s room. She opened her eyes and smiled to herself. Last night was beautiful beyond compare. She had never felt that way about anyone. Her heart beat wildly just at the thought of the passionate love she had made with Levi. She loved him, and she wanted more. She sat up and looked out the window. Snow had dusted the outdoors during the wee hours of the morning. Grace could picture herself and Levi running though the snow happily together. She longed desperately for her vision to come true. She needed to see Levi.   She slowly got out of bed and walked to her closet. She ran her hand down the row of clothing hanging there until she found the perfect outfit. Blue jeans and a red sweater, though simple, would look fantastic. 	She slipped the clothes on and with deep, slow sigh, Grace flung open her bedroom door. The living room was completely silent but the faint sound of her brother’s voice singing. Her parents were probably gone again, so she assumed her brother was practicing.  Riordan was sitting on the couch, playing guitar softly, but he was not singing. The only sound Grace could hear was coming from the boom box in the corner of the room. He was playing the album she and her brother recorded a few years before.  “I thought I burned that.” Grace laughed, reminiscing about that time in her life. Riory and Grace became the way they where together because of that record. It had also changed Riory. It was just before they recorded the collection that he had become a Christian.  Riory looked up and smiled at his sister. “You though so, but you know I’m not dumb enough to give you the only copy of anything!” “I should have known.” Riory motioned for Grace to sit down next to him, and she did so promptly.    “How are you doing?” Grace half felt like smacking him, and half like spilling the beans about her and Levi’s relationship. Levi had never asked her to be his girlfriend, but in Grace’s mind, they where one.    “I’m better.” Grace said, opting not to mention Levi unless Riory brought the subject up. “I’ve been having so much fun…” “With Levi, right?” Riory cut Grace off. She smiled. “With the band! I’ve missed it.” “So have I.” Riory confessed. “But not as much fun as I think you’ve been having.”   Grace blushed. “Yes. I HAVE been having a lot of fun getting to know Levi again. I forgot how much he was to me.” “So, how serious, then?” “We’re monogamous.” Grace at least assumed it was monogamous. With Levi’s presumed past, she had no idea. Deep down inside, she believed in Levi. She was his one and only.   “How is he treating you?” Grace gave her brother a confused look. “He’s not another Jason if that’s what you mean. He’s a sweetheart, Riory!” “I’m well aware of that, but that’s what Jason was too, at first that is.”  “Riory, that’s not true!” Grace gave her brother a harsh look. “You and I agreed before that Jason wasn’t the sweetest man alive. Jason openly cheated on me, but Levi, Levi will never leave me. He has given me his solemn vow. I am comfortable talking to him, but I was not with Jason. Levi is on a different planet then Jason.”   Riory rolled his eyes and laughed. “And unfortuatly, another planet as us a well.” “You’re just trying to get me angry, so stop.” Riory smirked at his little sister. It was like yesterday that she was in kindergarten, and he and his girlfriend were babysitting the tyke so that they could go to the ninth grade dance. Now, she was a young woman, with her own life.   “I’m sorry. I can’t help it. You’re my little sister and it’s…” “The brother’s job to be critical! Yes!” Grace finished his sentence. Grace came to the realisation many boyfriends ago, that no matter who it was, a minister or a gang member, Riory would always make fun of them because he knew it would get on her nerves. “Yeah, you bet you’re sorry!”   Grace sat down next to her brother on the couch. Riordan shrugged. “How is that new song coming along then, Grace?” Grace smiled. He did know when to stop. “It’s coming along quite well, actually. I think is sucks though.” “It’s about Levi, isn’t it?”  Grace did not know if she blushed or if Riory could read her mind. She was in fact writing the song about Levi. “Why do you think that?” She asked innocently. “I know these things!”   * * * * * * * * *  Levi sat peacefully in his bedroom with his guitar on his lap. His wanted deeply to visit Grace again, but could not. He knew that if she saw him the way he was, his body cut, his face and arms bruised, she would not be able to keep herself together. Levi could not bear to hurt her like that. He promised her he would protect her, and that means from everything, including himself.   Levi opened an unmarked bottle on his nightstand. Oswyn told him that he had used these little pills to relax, and he though he may as well try them out. Deep in thought, he shook the bottle until two pills landed in his hand. They were white and chalky, like aspirin. He took them quickly, and washed them down with a large glass of water.  Levi leaned back and rested his head on a pillow. He could not get the events of the night before out of his head. He just could not believe that the events of the night before we reality. To be in such bliss with the love of his life, then to come home and see such violence. He was still in shock, one, that his brother would actually get married, and two, that could ever act that way towards a woman, even when drunk.   Elaine was still shaken up, but refused to show it. She was her normal self, chatty and working hard in the kitchen. Her emotion strength, and sometimes stubbornness, was one of the qualities Levi and his Dad both admired in her.   When they were young, Ben made it very clear that their father was trying to replace their mother. In some ways, Levi believed his brother, though he never really admitted it. Now, in hindsight, Levi could see that it was not true. Levi had heard the stories about his mother from many different people, but every time he heard the same description, and it was nothing like Elaine.   Anna was her name. She was a tall and thin young woman with blond hair and blue-green eyes like the ocean. She was a shining beauty with a voice like a whispering wind, but was otherwise quiet and spent most of her time alone in her bedroom, singing songs, writing, and painting.   After loosing her brother in a horrible car accident, Levi’s mother was never the same. During the period after, she was chronically ill, depressed, and suicidal. Levi, sadly, could remember her cutting and burning herself while making dinner, and her brother trying desperately to stop her.   The look on Ben’s face when he told him that their mother had died was etched forever into Levi’s memory. He was ragged, pale, and he looked cold. Levi could remember the sound of his father sobbing in the other room with wife’s body.   Levi burst into tears as he thought of these painful memories. He quickly slid his hand beneath his bed and brought forth a blade. He set it on his wrist and prepared to slit a deep gash. He could hear his mother’s voice in his head. His head began to spin in random directions.   “My boy, sweet boy! Come to your mother, love! Come to me now! Do not worry! I am here! Come to me love!” Levi closed his eyes to keep from becoming sick to his stomach. He gashed himself deeply once, and then laid down the bloody blade on his bed. His ears were ringing.   He opened his eyes and lifted his head from his pillow. In the far corner of his room her could see his mother’s figure. She looked beautiful, but in her hands, she held a handgun. She gave Levi an ironic smile, a wink, pulled the gun to her abdomen, and then pulled the trigger. Levi reeled in pain from the noise of the blast.   “Hello, darling… Come to your mother, love! Come to me now! Do not worry! I am here! Come to me love!” Levi began to panic. He cried for his mother. “No! No… NO MUM!” He cried out. Suddenly, he felt as if he was on fire. He looked around the room and saw flames licking at his curtains. He tried to scream, but he could not.   He looked at his mother again. Blood gushed from her stomach. She was smiling at him. “Come to your mother, love! Come to me now!” Levi shuttered and turned his head again. Grace was standing there amidst the flames, a frightened look on her face. Levi could hear his mother’s laugh from the other side of the room. He stood and ran toward Grace. She disappeared and was replaced by his mother. She stood before him, grinning. He franticly looked around the room for an escape, but was blocked by flames.   He was startled by a piecing scream. He turned around and saw Grace pinned to his bed, his brother atop her and he was raping her. Grace’s screams of pain and horror shook Levi to the core. Levi tried to run back to the bed, but his legs where like molasses. His mother cackled. “Come!”   Ben looked over at Levi. His eyes pierced painfully into his. Grace screams softened, making Ben and Anna cackle. Jason lifted himself off Grace’s limb body. He was silent as he floated gracefully toward him. Ben reached out to him, making Levi fall to the ground in agony.   Anna reached out to Ben and pulled him close to her breast. Ben smiled, leaned in, and kissed his mother’s lips lustfully. Levi could taste blood and vomit in his mouth. He gagged and looked up at the two figures floating above him. Ben laughed as the two began to change.  Before Levi knew it, he was no longer looking at his mother and brother, but Jenna and Jason. Jason leaned down, his face no farther away then a half an inch. He grinned and placed a fierily hot hand on Levi’s shoulder. Levi tried to pull away, but his grip was like a tourniquet. “Your blood on my hands.”   Jenna and Jason disappeared, leaving Levi in his burning bedroom. He could hear the faint cries of Grace from the far side of the room. He ran toward her, the flames scorching his body. He cried out and flung himself onto the bed. Grace lay naked on his bed covered in blood. Her arms and legs were bound with barbed wire. Levi sobbed and pulled her close to his burned body.   Her body shook in convulsions as a blackish blood dripped from her blue lips. It smelled diseased and metallic, making Levi vomit. Shaking, he whipped his lips and unbound her limbs. Suddenly she stopped shacking, looked up and him, and pulled his face toward her. She kissed him repeatedly.  Levi’s body relaxed. He found himself running his hands over her zombie like body. “Levi… Stay with me…” Levi pulled Grace closely and together they stripped him of his clothing. Her frozen body began to become warm as she engulfed him.  She smiled at him as she kissed his chest. “My blood on your hands…”   In a flash that burned Levi’s eyes, both the flames and Grace disappeared. Levi was alone in his room. He weakly collapsed into his bed. His body was overcome with cold and he shook with fright. He could hear the voices of his father and Elaine downstairs, the TV in the living room, music playing in the room below him. “Gra…c…ee”  Thank for reading! More coming soon!
