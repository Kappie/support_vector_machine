I need someone to follow me around with a sound system and just play songs according to my mood, or what's going on, so instead of me just writing down lyrics, everyone can hear them. For instance, right now "Closing time" my semisonic would be playing. A few minutes ago "And so it goes" would have been playing. However, I can see one drawback to everyone constantly having their own soundtracks running... well two. One, you couldn't lie. The music would give it away. And two, do you know how many people would be constantly running the theme from Shaft? Think about it. It'd be like "wa-ka-ti-ca"  all the time.   Can ya dig it?
