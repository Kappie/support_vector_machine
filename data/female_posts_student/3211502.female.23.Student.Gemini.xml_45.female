However, I share that office with a few other people. Among these people, I rank the lowest on the totem pole/medical hierarchy. When these people need to use the room and the internet connection, I leave them be. Thankfully, I am able to snag a few hours of alone time a day so that I am able to get some work done.  But, let me get to the point of this entry - today was an especially interesting day. A group of new fellows just started working in the department. I hadn't really met any of them yet, but that was to be expected, since they don't really spend that much time sitting on their asses in the office that we share (unlike me). But, today, I got a chance to meet one of them. When I first got to the office, he was on the phone, so I wasn't able to introduce myself. Later, though, in the main office, we had a brief introduction. However, our more interesting encounter was later in the day. When I was heading back to the shared office with some files, I walked in on the fellow as he was changing into scrubs. We both turned beet red. I could not have been more embarrassed. Thankfully, he seemed relatively chill about the whole situation. I don't think I could handled it if he ended up being really pissed.
