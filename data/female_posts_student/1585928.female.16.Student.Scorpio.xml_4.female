We went to *Wal-mart to get our hunting License, and we saw Cody and Ronnie! so we talked to them a few mintues! and then we went to El Sombrero!.. oh but I did talk to Stephen last night, which was good cause we kinda talked about what happened with us and why we stopped dating, so it was good to get everything straight, but I kinda felt bad when he asked me if I still liked him and I didn't know what to say!..but its straight, we're still friends so I'm happy!!! =) but... today at school was pretty boring!..nothing good happened really! I had the hardest Algebra 2 test in the world! it sucked bad!! but anyways...oMg!! I miss Cary and TinTin!! I'm so ready for next week, so tintin will come home, and me and Eliz can chill with them!! but anyways, I'm gone! -holla-
