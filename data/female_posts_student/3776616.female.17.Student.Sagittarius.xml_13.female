My mom bought me shoes... black sneakers and blue flip flops. YAY! She's buying me more clothes tomorrow... I talked her into taking me to Vanity to buy some stuff for my senior pics and whatnot. Plus she doesn't mind buying stuff for me b/c she knows I won't lose it, wreck it, or stop wearing it w/in a week like Kait does... Muahahahahaha!  Went tolunch w/ mom and Don. Went to dinner at Red Robin w/ mom, Don, Kait, and grandma. So I haven't really eaten at home all day. This has got to be REALLY healthy for me... Who cares????  In a little whileI'm going to post about Ken... b/c I'm in a really bad mood now and I feel like ranting and raving... That's the thing I hate about me and happy smoke, b/c I always get super-depressed the next day... Totally unfair... But I want to play a game first to vent some frustration/confusion/anger/resentment/etc.
