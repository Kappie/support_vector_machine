We waited for Superman for 2 hours! That was bad. And I was very saddened to find out that both Vertical Velocity and Deja Vu were closed for the entire day :(. And, as usual, I got sunburned today. Like I said before, skin troubles are in my future :P. And that is all I have to say.     Last song I listened to:   Sabbra Cadabra  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Garage, Inc. .   Last meal I ate:  Fries.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Pfft. I don't know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Once again, I don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   I Disappear  by Metallica.   Favorite food today:  I had a nectarine. That was good :).   Most interesting thing I did today:  I went to Six Flags.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I saw what looked like a six-year-old kid with a cell phone. How pathetic. But it was funny nonetheless.
