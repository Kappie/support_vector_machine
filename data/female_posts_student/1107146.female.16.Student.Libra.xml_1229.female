I've been thinking about this whole situation between you guys, and I think that I agree, to a certain amout, with Josh. But, remember, I have really no clue what you guys are fighting about, and am not involved at all.  I just bake the cupcakes of which there are fewer. Call me please, Linds, or someone who knows the Travis situation.  I just need someone whose good at giving advice.
