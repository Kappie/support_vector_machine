I drew him a cow, he taped it to an unmentionable spot on the front of his pants and started grinding the freezer. Ahh! Needless to say, the time went by fast...  Marie had a party lastnight. Greg, Ricky, Justin, Robbie, Jesse, Jessica, Ali, and Tyler came. It was pretty fun actually. I love hanging around medium sized groups. Not too small, but not too big. It was comfortable. I took a whole roll of film between Friday night at the football game, and lastnight. Now I just need some money to develop them.
