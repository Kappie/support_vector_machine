In anycase the counselor (my classmate) had absolutely no idea what I was saying. He was missing the points to what I was saying and when he did talk, as I didn't allow for him to talk much, he kept repeating, "sounds like this is a struggle for you....".  At the end of the session he told me I was very confusing and he had a hard time identifying my points.  He  also said he had a hard time not being directive with me and that he felt I had a lot of conflict inside about the subject so it was hard for him to comment.  Thanks!  The life of Rebecca Holtzman.  In anycase I'm meeting with this guy again on Saturday so I can be the counselor for him.  I'm a little nervous as he is from Spain and has an accent. This guy was actually on 99.5 The Wolf as Bachelor of the Year.  He said he was still on their website, but I've looked it up and can't seem to find him or I would've posted a pic.  He also brought up a point about those reality shows like the "Bachelor".  He claimed that they are just all actors and just acting because if they weren't there is no way they could've got that involved with each of the girls and really felt something for them.  My classmate said that he ended up having to quit when he started dating the 7th girl because it was just too hard and he was having way too much anxiety about it.  He felt as if it were a big game and they were all just players in it.  Some of the girls were in it for the wrong reasons and he just had trouble dating all these girls at once and emotionally he couldn't handle it.  Apparantly it was pretty bad for him as he had anxiety attacks for a little while after.  The Wolf 99.5 almost didn't let him quit.  They stated that's the price you pay for getting 3,000 dollars from us.  Craziness.
