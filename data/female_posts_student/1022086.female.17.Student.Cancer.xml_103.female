What color are your eyeballs?: white, black, and brown, and just a bit of forest green, but you'd have to be me to know that because you wouldn't stare at my eyes for that long on a good humoured summer day.  Friends  Best Friends in the whole world:: honestly, probably my sister and my cat when it really comes down to it, but I do get by (not high!) with a little help from all my friends. Loudest: Lyndsey   Quietest: Coty, by far   Nicest: Hinkle or Sela, perhaps... or my own fiance`, Jopaka!   Most annoying: I normally don't associate with people that annoy me too much so as to prevent killing them   Most evil: Er... er... I don't really know right this very now, truthfully.   One who's always tired: I thought I was the one who's always tired out of the group of friends?  NO, wait. Matt Jackson. Has the most moodswings: my sister-- let's throw her in there. And Coty   Borrows money the most:my sister. But it's a two-way thing, honest! Best hair: Emily's hair ties in a knot... how cool is that?! Longest hair: Er... I have the longest hair... it's about to get cut off, though!! Given that, likely Sela.   Craziest: Emily, by far   Weirdest: Hehehe, I love you Kimbo! (but I'm right there with you on this one!)... and then there's Jay. Well, Sean, too... Most talkative....: JESSICA!!!   Saddest: Sela   Happiest: Kim  Always hungry: I think I win that one... but then Kim's "one of the funniest skinny people who eat a lot" that I know... and then there's Coty... ehhh, we're teenagers. It's what we do.   Favorites  Color: Blue!! Bluuuuuuuue!!!    Band: BLUR!!   Type of music: Oy, I listen to essentially anything but most country and poppish pop pop. There isn't a favourite.

I don't have a favourite person (I could be decapitated over this, do understand!)   Place to be: hmm... nearly any coffee shop, maybe? Or anywhere out of the continent... Type of travel: er... by plane? Television show: as of late, I've discovered that MTV show, something about pimpifying cars... it is actually really cool.
