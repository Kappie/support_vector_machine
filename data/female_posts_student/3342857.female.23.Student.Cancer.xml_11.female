I had to say that my parents are always supportive of what i am doing without much questioning while friends.....thanks...i actually find an inner strength in doing things because i know whatever or however that i am going to do something....i know that i have someone who always have this belief in them that i can do something that is not easily achievable....i know i have a place to fall back...and this really helps especially at times when i doubt myself.
