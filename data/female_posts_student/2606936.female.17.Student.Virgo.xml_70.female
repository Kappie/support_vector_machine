It profiles a whole bunch of cults and deviant groups and stuff.    Now, through  urlLink dooce , Iwas reading about some ministry, and wnated to know if they were on the cult list. They weren't but as I scrolledthis definition caught my eye. It makes me giggle.       Wicca:  The practice of witchcraft, nature worship, worship of the Gods and   urlLink  Goddess   ,   urlLink  paganism    and neopaganism, various groups with assorted names. In modern form, it is a revival of pagan religions (  urlLink  neo-paganism   ) and the worship of “pre-Christian” Gods and Goddesses. A common creed is, “Do what you will, and harm none.” Modern Wicca owes much to the influence of Gerald B. Gardner and has been further advanced by the writings of Patricia Monaghan, Silver Ravenwolf, the late Doreen Valiente, and the leading   urlLink  occult    publisher   urlLink  Llewellyn World Wide Ltd   . In popular culture, films and television programs such as  The Craft, Practical Magic, Sabrina the Teenage Witch,  and  Charmed  have helped attract teens and children to this growing religion.    Let's ignore "the Gods and Goddesses." They were trying, after all, to educate people about the religion, and they probably were a)confused or b)trying to make it much weirder and nonsensicalthan it actually is.    No, the real problem was that whole "pop culture" part. Because Sabrina was totally into Wicca and Britney Spears, er,goddess worship..... she was so respectful of the earth...... even with all those Christmasspecials and revenge schemes and meddling with nature and hatred of Libby et aland stuff.    (What can I say, I was a loyal follower up until she got that internship at that stupid music magazine. It wasfun to watch her at school, but not when she's in the real world. Enh.)   ButI digress.... That show was a teen comedy, not a portrayal of pagan spirituality. Sabrina  was magic-without-a-k. Saying that someone converted to Wicca because of watching Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  is like saying that someone converted to Christianity because of watching  Frosty the Snowman .   I mean, all these people who have never watched shows like this,assume that they're all aboutblack spells and dark worship, when they have nothing to do with the religion at all.   Like those people who believe Harry Potter is evil? Many admit to having never read the books, and then bash them for being occult and crap. Depending on how you define occult, maybe playful children's-storybook "magic" is, but hello? Do you allow your children to watch movies like Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan or Cinderella?   Does anyone else see the humor in this? It's like they were BSing a paper for school and had to come up with some random sources, so they just pulled books off the shelf and carded them.    Is it the term "witch" that bugs people so much? I mean, it isn't the religious followers' fault that mainstream culture turned it into something so different. It doesn't mean "a Wiccan" they way it should anymore. Now it means someone who does magic, meaning turns people into toads and shit, or someone evil who eats children or whatever.    And "magic," too, now means pretty much something defying the laws of nature. "Magick" means energy that comes from religious observances, not something that carpet cleaner can perform. Do you think these anti-Harry-Potter-and-Sabrina people boycott products like  urlLink this?  Do they try to have their childrens' teachers fired for reading  urlLink this  in class?    Oh, man. There are times when I wonder why I don't have a religion, and then there are times like now, when I'm glad of it.
