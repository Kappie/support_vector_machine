Luckly I was able to catch a certain post before it was going to be loaded onto the site. I knew I should have kept those two apart. I knew exactally what was going to happen, they just thought that I was freaking out like usual.  I have a direct message for Abby,  "Don't you dare think about posting what you just wrote. I know what you are thinking about doing, and your just setting yourself up for falure. I know what is going to happen, your going to scare him, and he will run away from you if you do it. So I suggest you really think about what your going to do, before you go through with it." That is the only thing I will say and I will not go any further into detail, because Abby knows what I am speaking of.
