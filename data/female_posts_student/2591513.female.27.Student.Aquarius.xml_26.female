In fact I do my best to help everyone, now I am afraid that from helping people I have dug myself in a hole I cannot get out of.  I have been so depressed lately.  UGH  I hate money.  Anyway, I applied for a job at the base...hopefully Ed remembers to turn it in.  He is so moody lately.  Gosh, you think women PMS, try the male version...I guarantee it is that much worst.  Leila is in a predicament, but I think the route she is going will be the best for her.  Unless you are someone else, you can't rely on the parents.  Just isn't wise...as I am learning.  I am so annoyed, in a way bad mood.  Like I said, the money situation is horrible...and according to my mom, it is about to get worst.  Shoot me already. I am so serious.  I don't think I have felt this bad in a very long time.  It isn't mom's fault.  DAMN MY COUSIN!  I am usually a nice person...but FRICKIN' A...He screwed us BIG TIME.  SOB  Karma, that's all I gotta say on that...Karma's a BITCH.    Okay, so evidently I am in a VERY foul mood.  Sorry.
