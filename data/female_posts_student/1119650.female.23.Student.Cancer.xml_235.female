I think the woman who plays Trinity, Carrie Ann Moss, is THE most bad-assed, fucking rock your socks off, kick your ass and then spit on you, tough as nails hot chick EVER!  God she rules.  Freddy vs. Jason  Legally Blonde 2 trailers also rocked.  No Return of the King trailer though, that was disappointing.  Oh and they had a Terminator 3 trailer and a 2Fast 2 Furious (Fast  the Furious sequel) trailer.  What pieces of frozen bum piss and monkey shit are those movies?  Jesus fuckin christ, man!   urlLink Jack  offered me the following comments about the film early this morning: Iamtheyeti311: meh, i felt cheated Iamtheyeti311: lol Iamtheyeti311: now i know what a woman feels like after sex I AbsolutAngel I: lol Iamtheyeti311: like, "thats it."  All in all I give Matrix: Reloaded a 9 out of a possible 10 pink divarific stars.
