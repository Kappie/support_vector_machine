But believe it or not Viggo isn't just an amazing actor, he is also well known for his poetry, his artwork, his photography...After seeing him in the movie    A Walk on the Moon     I did some research and found out about his many talents. Since then I have fallen in love with his work, and I would now like to share some of it with you. My profile picture is also work from Viggo Mortensen, it's called Wolvenbosch.         Sun Losing Its Yellow, 1998        Lost 2, 2000        1045, 1998        After Darkly Noon, 2002     Keepsake     Still unused,   the letter opener   she got on her birthday   has become tarnished.   It lies on the sill,   next to a seashell   she found in Flordia   before moving west.   Before becoming a writer.   Before becoming a mother.   Her son wants to use it   as a dagger,   to wield it savagely   against monsters and bad guys   that come streaming out   from the toy-cluttered corners   of his room,   but he can't reach it yet.
