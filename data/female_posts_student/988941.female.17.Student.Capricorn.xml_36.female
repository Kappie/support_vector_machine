I guess when you start it you would feel silly becaause you aren't flexible but I guess the more you practise the easier you will find it to relax and once you relax the eaiser it wiwll be to become more flexible. And at the same time it improves your daily mood and way of dealing with things. :) Good way to chill out too. I'd like to try it actually although i know I said to Tom its silly but I have changed my mind. LOL.
