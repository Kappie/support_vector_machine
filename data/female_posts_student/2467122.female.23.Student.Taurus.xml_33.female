Cheap Trick was good, too (though I know not many people showed up for them).  Friday was full of Rita and Annie bonding- we always have the best time, even if we don't do anything.  I can't wait until she comes to the city- whoo hoo!!!  Rita and I back in the Big Apple- that means trouble, he he he!  Saturday was great, too- Vinnie and I hung out with Katie and Tim.  We had a wonderful Texas-style dinner, followed by ICE CREAM and miniature golf!!!  The weekend was an uber-delight... Until Saturday night.  Saturday night my sniffles turned into mega-congestion with a hacking cough, and I couldn't sleep at all.  I finally ended up going to the drug store at 4am, when I couldn't handle it anymore.  I must've gone through half a box of tissues and the coughing kept triggering my gag reflex and making me barf.  It was not a good night, to say the least.  Then I had to drive back to New York.  Not a fun trip.  Needless to say, I am getting plenty of rest today.  It's just me, Eeyore, Vicks 44, and lots of Spongebob episodes.  I hope this doesn't last more than a few days, I hate being sick.
