Apparently these aquatic mammals are being used to detect land mines under the water with their sonar abilities and point out the mines to soldiers which allows them to avoid or possibly diffuse them.  This leads me to wonder:  are the famous dolphins going to be protected or sent to work?  I mean dolphins like "Snowflake" the Miami Dolphin's Mascot and star of critically acclaimed Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Flipper who had a TV series AND a movie are already trained to do complicated stunts.  Wouldn't it make sense that these guys should need less training to be helpful...or will their "celeb" status protect them and keep them safe from a possible dolphin draft.  I think its left to be seen.    Upon discussion of this topic with my coworker, Twan Money, I was presented with the idea of what if a dolphin misses a mine?   urlLink "I love bumble bee, bumble bee tuna!"   And on a completely random note (still keeping with maritime activity and mammals though), I give you:  urlLink Twiggy, the waterskiing squirrel!  coming soon to a boat show near you!
