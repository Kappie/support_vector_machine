I don't know whether it's because I have alot on my mind or what, but it's blowing me that I can't go back to bed and I have work in the morning.  Bad brain, bad! Roll over, play dead... or something.  Grr... who the hell makes infomercials? One I'm watching now is for some sort of  cream that gives the buyer an instant tan. No harmful sun rays, all for the low low price of---- wait. Hah, I don't need some crazy tanning cream. I have a perpetual one year round, thank you very much. :P  No, but seriously...things like that always make me think about the remarkably low self esteem in the world(as if I'm one to talk!). Who cares if you don't have a dark tan? Who cares if you don't lose 99 pounds in one hour(for 99 "easy" payments of 29.99)? I'm awake, but you all need to be awake too. Wake up and realize that some of the worrying you do about yourselves are collectively stupid.  /minirant.  Woo, I feel better. And only 4:25 to boot. Maybe I can get back to sleep...
