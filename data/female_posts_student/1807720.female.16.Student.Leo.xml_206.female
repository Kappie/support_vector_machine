She told me this like three hours ago.  I waited forever for her, I was worried something happened.  Then she calls and says that she is still at their place and staying like a hour longer.  Like what the FUCKING HELL I AM SUPPOSE TO DRINK A MILKSHAKE AT 11 AT FUCKING NIGHT JUST CAUSE MY SISTER WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME.  FLAMES SUCK AS RIGHT NOW.  You know I was going to go to a party, but I stayed home cause she always complains how I always leave during the game.  I hate myself right now.  I want to die.  I want to kill myself.  You have no idea how fucking tempted I am to find some pills in the cupboard and swallow the whole damn thing.  If only someone was here right now.  But no, I'm all alone, no one is here.  I feel like no one cares.  I feel like I don't even have a mother.  That's nice and dandy that I own a car, and a laptop, and million other friggin things.  That doesn't matter ,though.  I want to be happy.  I want someone to care about me.  I want someone to be here right now.  My mom doesn't barely ask any questions or anything.  She's too busy.  Too busy with everything but me.  I wish Mrs. J was here right now.  I just wish I could talk to her.  She is the one person in the world who truly cares about people.  She cares.  She asks questions.  She takes interest in things.  I just want a mother like that.  Some one who cares and puts me first, makes me feel important, and makes me feel like I possess talents and can accomplish a a lot of things in life.
