I hear about them, and what they have been through... Something now.. .that i have alot to say about...   Out reach... It was put on my heart by a dear friend, Kyle, that i need to stop sitting around thinking someone else will reach for God, and i dont have to. So i wanted to go out... Right then right there. But couldn't, seeing how it was 2 in the morning and my dad would kill me if i did so. But now i'm scared... I wanted to cry just like two min.s ago talking to Kyle. The fact is i always get the heart to go out, but i never EVER do go out... I starting making excusses... And i have the feeling like i need to do this... I need to get uncomfterable... But i dont want to... I'm soo tired of being a wussy...
