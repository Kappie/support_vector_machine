The female employees there are deliberately making it hard for me to do my job, not to mention the fact that I'd never touched those breakfast buttons in my entire life! But, on the brighter side of things, I got paid today. I worked 44 hours in the past 2 weeks, and definitely got paid for it. It's really nice! Tomorrow I work from 12-4:30, but fortunately I'm working with Kenny. He's so nice to me, and sure makes the time go by faster.  Mom and Dad are going out tonight and I am so completely enthralled; we're all watching Lord of the Rings and vegging out. So nice! I also think I'm going to surf the web for a bit, and continue my college search. I know I want to attend a small campus, but then again want it to be by a larger city, so I could be subject to a wider array of diversity, and things to do as well. But, I need financial assistance, and that alone scares me; small colleges are expensive! But I'm sure it all will work out, because I'm a firm believer of "everything happens for a reason." God will be watching, so it'll be cool.   Oh, and last but not least, my tennis record ils 4-3! Not bad, as long as I've won as many matches as I've lost, I'd consider myself in the green.
