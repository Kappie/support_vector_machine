And, ya know, maybe it's just all in the way we approach our lives. If you don't expect anything good to ever come out of life, then nothing ever will. And if you don't have faith in yourself, then no one will. I know the feeling of faithlessness...it's empty and there's nothing to look forward to. But if you're going to have faith in ANYTHING, let it be in yourself. Because you've got control over that much.  I am content.  Catch ya later crazies.
