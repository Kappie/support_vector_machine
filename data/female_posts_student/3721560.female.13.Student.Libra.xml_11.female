Every where you go, you see billboreds, signs, and articals in the paper aboutchildren getting into trouble. What doe they expect? There isn't anywhere in Kokomo for kids to go unless thwey get in trouble, or have to pay all of their allowence, or sitting doing nothing and being bored. They are also retard and are oblivious to the fact that they are hurting this inviroment soe much that they're really not giving, any future generation that much of a chance.  Guess thats all I hafta say except for, they need to get those Dickheads who dount knoe what thwe hell they're doing in the whitehouse outa there.
