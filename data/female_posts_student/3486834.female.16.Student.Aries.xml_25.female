I, ROBOT!! woohoo! it was a pretty good movie. i liked it.. now i am bored and watching mad tv!!   "i have a brother in idiot, so i speak fluent in dumbass." -MAD TV. haha. i love that show.  "*SNEEZE* i'm sorry, i'm allergic to bullshit"-Detective Spooner, I Robot. lol. just thought that was pretty clever. well not really. but it's still funny.
