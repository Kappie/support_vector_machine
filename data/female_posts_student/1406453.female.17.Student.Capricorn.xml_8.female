I was in the middle of a feverish hunt for a sweat towel when I found out that Christy, my gym buddy, would in fact not be at the gym until 9 a.m. Argh. So much for changing.  I'm considering browsing online or maybe just reading  Manchurian  until I really do wakeup. Or there's the convention (Steven was on KUSI TV last night). They're up early  and  they have a time difference. Hmm. How much Democracy can one take so early in the morn?
