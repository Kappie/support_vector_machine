I've been playing the Harry Potter games on the computer since yesterday and I'm almost through with the first one. I think this is the 3rd time I will have beaten it. I've never finished the second one and haven't really gotten very far into it at all but I plan to after I finish the first. Then I'll probably play the LoTR game which I've never even tryed to play. Beyond Atlantis frustrates me since I got so far on the old computer but, having switched, I lost my game and have to start all over again. No fun.   Some folks are really weird...   The middle of this week marks the half-way point of summer break. I just can't really accept that. I haven't done anything. It feels like school has been out just a week or two. I remember in 8th grade we had to write an essay, a persuasive essay on whether school should be like it is, with the long summer break or have year-round schooling, and every 4 or 5 (can't remember exactly) weeks you have one week off, and 2 weeks off for Christmas, and like 3 sometime during the summer. I was the only one who supported the latter. I like breaks spread out evenly. A long break seems nice but when it's over it's over...you have such a long way to go before the next break. I hate that.  If I was ever to be in a band I would swear to never do any covers, remixes or acoustic versions of songs already produced. And never get interviewed by any teen magazine, Alternative Press, or anything like that. Probably just indie mags like Law of Inertia or fan zines. Yep.  So boring. x_X    Music: The Chicken Song - AFI
