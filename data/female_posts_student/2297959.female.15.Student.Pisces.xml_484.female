Exactly four years to this day, us and our friends in plastic pride were in the middle of a tour in Sweden. After sleeping for two hours and then driving the 13 hours to the show in Link√∂ping, we realized that the show was not promoted at all (only 6 people turned up at the show). So we called the promoter "biffen" (Swedish for "the beef") and complained. His reply was that we were a bunch of brat kids complaining and that he were going to bring some friends and baseball bats and come down and beat us up. After talking to some people down there and realizing the the guy probably was serious we decided to leave, so we nicely packed up our gear and left.    Looking back at that, ... It really puts things in perspective. Much love to the few people that came out to the show four years ago, I'm sorry that we did not get to play.   /T "  story from a swedish man in blindside. i like it.
