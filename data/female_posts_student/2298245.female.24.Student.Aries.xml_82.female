Actually, and more accurately, I am missing it as I type this, and I am far away from home, so there is no chance of me getting home in time to catch even part of it.  Couple this with my lack of VCR possession at the moment, and we have the makings of a real modern American tragedy,  n'est-ce pas ?  Oh well, I shall have to muddle through somehow, and content myself with being informed by my friends of what happened without getting to visually partake in it myself.  Sigh.
