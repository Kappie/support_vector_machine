Saturday was me trying to wake up, while watching some Blockbuster flicks, and Sunday, I played tennis with Britt, Natasha, Jill, and her friend, Anita. Let's just say, N and N Nomenclature Nation memebers should stick to Cricket and naming things. It was fun of course, but I felt asleep.       I feel as if ever since JSA, I've been asleep, and yes, it ended only a couple of days ago, but seriously, I haven't yet woken up. I need to work on that 'cause being asleep and trying to go through the motions sucks. I think I'm just finally feeling the effects of the month without sleep or reality. I hope I wake up soon because I need to get back into the groove. My room is still a mess. I'm still packed up. My room still feels foreign without my stuff back where it belongs. I want to get settled back in, but then I'm leaving again on August 11th, which makes me sad to think that this whole summer, I'll be likea stranger in my own room, in my own house, in my own town, with my own friends.      There definitely is a different dynamic in hanging out with my friends. It's fun, of course, but it's not how I remember it. That's dumb. It was only one month. Oh well. Yes, my point is that I won't be around in August too much either, so this summer has been bizarre.       On a better note, I'll be seventeen really soon! Yay! I don't know what that means, except that I'll be another year older. I think it'll make me feel more likea Senior in high school. August 6th baby--17 years-old! I doubt I'll actually have time to plan an entire party, so I might just hang out with some people. I don't know. Anyways, this was just an update, so nothing much--simply a string of random thoughts.       Maybe next time I'll write something more interesting.
