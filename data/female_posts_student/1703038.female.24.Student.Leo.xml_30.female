Do I tell you how bizarre our 50 degree weather is? How everyone except Jay forgot my birthday on Tuesdayand my grandmother brought over a frozen tub of soup instead of the ice cream she promised? How I spent far too many minutesagonizing over willow green or fern green colored towels at JC Penney when we put them on the registry?   Nah...my Ladye of Leisure anecdotes are mind-numbing to me, so no reason to bother you.   Since I'm relegated to 28.8K technology in the cornfield, and my parents are taking the computer in anyway, I don't think I'll be blogging until after the honeymoon. Take care of yourselves, and please feel free to check back in after August 22 or so. Hopefully I'll have some honeymoon pics (not THAT kind) posted, and I'll have more to talk about than my doggie's tapeworm battles and how much fun it is to steal corn from my neighbor's pasture.  Or, then again, I may realize that typing about crap is fun and I'll see you all tomorrow.   Best wishes.
