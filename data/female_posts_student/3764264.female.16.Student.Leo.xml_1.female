As it is, I'm showered and clean and wearing nothing but black clothes that fit nice and feel good.   I talked to him briefly a couple of times today. He seems fine. I panicked and wrote him an email when I was feeling like crap. Not as much anymore though. Still kinda feeling scared. I don't know what of, or if it has to do with Erich at all. But for the most part, I'm not as anxious anymore. But I probably shouldn't have sent that email anyway. It was... brash. And slightly gimped.   I've got to go though. Mother Dearest summons. *cringes*  Sage
