Gorged myself at Garcia's in IF today; seriously, those chips and salsa were worth staying another 10 minutes after they'd cleared the main meal's dishes.    Burned it off in the mall, though.  I never go shopping for myself in Moscow.  It honestly never occurs to me.  Get to make up for it here.  Yay.  Found some good stuff.  New shoes, new pants, new sweater and some promising ones sure to be under the tree in a month.  Decided, while Mom and I were admiring a new outfit due out later this winter, that I'm cutting my hair all off this summer.  Not shaved, dear god.  But I think it's time for a short, stylish, maybe even a bit dykey, but not butch, hairstyle.  And I've got 6 months to get used to the idea.  So yea, got home and had to hit the Pine Ridge Mall because it was only 5.  Whatever.  I called Carrie while Mom did JCPenny's.  Then on to Vicker's to secure Dad's present of 5-buckle goloshes.  I shit you not; it's what the man wants.  Got home just in time to catch the boys on their way to dinner.  I wasn't even hungry, but I've never been able to resist the smell of fresh grease and onions frying.  The butter on the toast was the same shit they drizzle on popcorn in movie theaters for fuck's sake!    Suppose I'm just getting ready for tomorrow.  Yea, sure, we'll go with that...
