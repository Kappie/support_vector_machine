She was suppose to come over at 4 and never called until 9:30 saying she hadda go to a funeral that she didn't no about. Oh well, yesterday was gay to. I helped Alex sell her fundraiser thingy for Cheerleading because her momma won't pay for it. But anyways we stopped by this boy Al's house, Brandon and Terrence were over there. Terrence kept on telling me that he wanted me to come downstairs to have some fun because he hadda hard baseball game and needed to have fun. I really didn't wanna stay so I told Alex that we needa leave. We left and went back over there an hour later. I really didn't wanna go over but I did because she gotta crush on Brandon. We go over there and are sitting in the basement and Terrence just keeps on talking to me. I'm trying to ignore him but he just keeps on talking. So he's like you gotta pretty face, you got pretty hair and then says you wanna go in the other room and talk? I say no we can talk right here. So he hadda ask me at least 20 times and I kept on saying no. I finally went back there and he just kept on asking the same thing over and over, can he get any play. I said no over and over until I just got tired of it and left. Right when I walked out the room I told Alex we needed to go so we left. We left there at 9 got back at her house about 9:15. We're sitting in the driveway and we see Felix running home. Earlier he had his little Moped thingy riding around. He runs inside and all of sudden everyone comes running out, Man, Man's sister, Man's gf, Felix, and John get in the car and go around there corner. I bet one of the boys took Felix's moped because like 15 mins later he came back with it and everyone else came back. but oh well, haven't really talked to John, haven't even seen him today and he didn't call last night so I dunno. Yesterday when they were all hoppin in the car I said John he looked over and then just got in the car. I dunno he's an idiot but anyways I'm bout to go watch Forest Gump with my sister.
