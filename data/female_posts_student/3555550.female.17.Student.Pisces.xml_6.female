Not their music or their lyrics or the skills of Paul Simon by any stretch, but the importance of Art Garfunkel (am I spelling that right...or does it even matter?). You see, he does NOTHING. Paul obviously has the writing skills with his touching lyrics and soft melodies, and he also has the musical talent with his lovely voice and harmonious guitar. Then there's Art. Singing harmonies that are sometimes not completely in tune, and just standing there like the overrated obnoxious looking ass he is. I mean, listen to Paul Simon's solo stuff! He's genius -hands down. Art has nothing to do with the success of "Simon and Garfunkel". He is simply part of the title, but nothing more.  So when you think, "Oh, I totally want to listen to some Simon and Garfunkel" you should be thinking "Oh, I totally want to listen to some Simon and Simon because Paul Simon is so cool and talented."  THE FUCKING END.  P.S. Ben Folds Five rocks. Ben shouldn't have been an ass and dropped the band. Even if it wasn't out of assholeness...he shouldn't have dropped them. T.E. (again)
