It's hard to explain...basically there was an error message every five seconds, the color scheme / resolution was all screwed up, nothing would open. So the next morning we took it into the computer place, and I got it back tonight. He installed XP on there instead of ME, which is great because I have wanted to do it for forever. He installed a new drive, also. Apparently my computer had over 150 viruses on it. Yikes.  So it's back and better than ever :D
