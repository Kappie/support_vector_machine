By the way, I challenge any of you (aside from Zheng who has probably memorised the whole book by now) to find who said that quote and about whom. Mary, you would probably like  Spaceballs , I know I would. So if you get it, lend it to me, will ya?  Men in Tights  is good also. Tina, Ioan is about 30, or was last I checked, so he might be 31 or 32 now. I'm a member of one of his fan sites. I got an acceptance email about it the other day... After  three months . I'd completely forgotten. I stayed up til past one last night reading  Pride and Prejudice , then watched 5 hours of it today! I love Colin Firth! He's  so  wonderful! Everybody, watch BBC version of P, cos it is  so cool !  Happy rest of hols Don't do schoolwork! Toodles
