Like every other relationship, we've got some quirks to work out and knots to untie...who doesn't? And I personally think we have an awesome relationship compared to some of the other ones I know of. We love and respect eachother so much, we trust in God to make our relationship (and hopefully, someday, our marriage) exactly what he wants it to be, we make healthy decisions together, and we always put the other one first. I felt, until two days ago, that there was  still  something missing. I wasn't sure what it was, and it didn't bother me too much until I couldn't just casually talk to him anymore. Whatever it was ...it was getting in the way of us talking, which is the necessity in every relationship...especially ours. I couldn't talk to him without saying something that I truly didn't mean or something I'd regret later. Somehow he has enough power (and passiveness, which isn't a good thing) within himself to still be loving and understanding towards me when there's something wrong with me or our relationship. Two nights ago, he finally talked to me, and let everything out. (Which, quite honestly, I'd been waiting a few months for.) He told me exactly how he felt about everything I do (no details really, he spoke in general). One of the only things he felt that we'd be better off if I changed was if I would stop holding him back from doing stupid stuff. If any of you know Nick personally, you know he's had at least eight or nine near-death experiences in his life (irronically none since we've been dating), and when he told me that, even though it was before we were going out and I was still with someone else... I wanted to do all I could to stop him from doing anything that could kill him.  He's been in car accidents, bike accidents, his lungs almost failed him a few times, he almost fell out of a window when he was a baby...everything near-death I could think of he had already experienced. So much as him sliding down the railing of a stair case scared me. But he helped me remember that, him being a little rascalthat he is was one of the many reasons I fell for him in the first place. Every dumb risk-taking little thing he did in front of me took my breath away (and believe me, to this day I don't know why) ...but why would I try to take that away from him? I've come to realize he's been more so much more cautious and he values lifeso muchmore since November when I decided to finally be with him, and it hit me that  I don't have to worry  so much about him anymore. There's still a huge piece of me who wants to hold him tight and keep him from anything that could hurt him, but if it's who he is toget out there and take chances all of the time, why would I try to take that away from him? I love him so much, I've been in love with him for a while now...and that's one of the  biggest treasures  God has sent to earth for me, I'm not going to risk losing it. I'd like to try to keep him safe, but I also want him to be happy. So that's one thing I'm working on at the moment, along with being a better daughter and a more caring and understanding to my environment and the people who I live with/choose to live with (my friends) and such...I know it's going to take a lot of time, energy and prayer, I wasn't born the nicest person...but there's nothing God can't fix. Anyone who reads this, please pray for me...I'd like to be a better person in the eyes of God, and I can't do that without prayer. And remember, two people in prayer sends 10,000 angels in flight...(as opposed to 1000 for one person) so yeah. Thanks for reading, and praying if you did. I'll write more when something comes up. PEACE!
