So updates on the guy situations. Mike V. - see i invited him to come to Darien lake with me cause everyone else couldn't come. And he asked where it was and i told him it was in the states...and he apparently isn't allowed to go to the states....so i knew there was that bad boy in him. Tee hee...ah he's such a cutie...but still trying to stop myself for liking this guy too much...but i got my other boys attempting to keep my mind off of him... Sean - total sweetie, a random. But a total sweetie, he's so cute and adorable...a little scary though...i don't think he's necessarly dating material...but i guess we'll see...whatever happens...but still i dunno...he's the hardcore bad boy:) the kind i like;) Matt (dream boy) - aw my baby....i dunno...my feelings are now confused about him now...he sent me an e-mail the other day just randomly...just saying and reassuring me that he still likes me dispite what i think, which is really sweet, which means i still need to write him back...but its fustrating...cause like when i was loosing my feelings for him he gains it all back just by saying and doin little things....i like him so much.... T - busy doin his recording studio stuff...will call when he gets back... Cisco - he is a sweetie, but nothing there...just friends...i thought i liked him...but i dunno i saw him and i guess it just wasn't there...whcih is totally fine, love having more friends:)  So my mind is constantly running on about Mike V. and Matt....*sigh* oh Mike M. also was talking to me on msn and he was so sweet, i thought that he lost interest in me and everything but i was talking to him and he was explaining to me that he's had a lot of shit going on in his life right now. With his family's health issue which definitly comes first and i was so happy to see how sweet he was and what he was doing for his family. But yeah...he's a sweet heart and i get to see my other Mike E. on thursday! woo hoo! :) so excited:)  Friday...piss bored...waiting for my brothe rto leave the house so i can Sean back...blllllaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh So feekin tired maaaaaaannnnnnn okay val shall go make food and hopefully my brother will be gone by then.... Alrighty people ttyl :) ta ta!
