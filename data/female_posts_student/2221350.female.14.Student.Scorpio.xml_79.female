Phenomenon is one of my absolute favorite movies 4. i hate the girl who does the GladWare commercials, and if i ruled the world, i would have her buried, dug up, and catapulted into the sun. 5. i would do almost anything to avoid unconstructive confrentation((i.e., anything that wasn't a formal debate on an actual subject)), which is why i tend to tear out of buildings/rooms where such might occur.
