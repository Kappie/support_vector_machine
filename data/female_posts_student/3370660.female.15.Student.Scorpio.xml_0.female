I thought this last discussion would figure things out, rather than make them worse.  But now we both know I don't know the slightest thing about you. And now we both know these last 8-9 months have been a waste, but we've yet to acknowledge that fully.  When you told me you wanted someone to truly know you, but I couldn't be that person, was when I regretted everything about you.  Is this it? I'd like to think he'd give me another chance. But I know that now is the time to turn around, and not look back.   Current music:  Between Love and Hate | The Strokes
