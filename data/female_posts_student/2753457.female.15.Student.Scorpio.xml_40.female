Normally, I get totally stressed out before one of his tests, but tonight I am not worried about it at all.  And this is what worries me.  Where is this confidence coming from?  It is a sad day indeed when one must worry about worrying.  This test is no simpler or better than the others.  In fact, it is probably worse.  But I cannot bring myself to worry enough to study well.  It looks like I'll have to force myself.  I already went over most of the stuff, but I need to do it all again.  God, it's 11 o'clock.  What am I doing sitting here?  Wow, this is the point where I've totally lost control over my actions.  Maybe there's more to this procrastination than I thought.  Hahaha, it's kind of funny really.  Or maybe it's not, and I'm just crazy. Ok, I really am going now.  Force-feed this crap into my mind.  The test is only about 14.5 hours away.
