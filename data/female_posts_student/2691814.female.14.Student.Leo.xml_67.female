We played Bull Shit like 50 times...i actually won! lol....he looked like he was about to fall asleep on my couch lol. That woulda been fun,,,if only my mom weren't there! damn lol.   Hmm...i feel sad. im inside....and all of my friends finally came out. See i have more responsibilities than keith. When the parents go somewhere...i have to watch the house and take phone calls and just stay home..plus cook my own dinner tonight. It just gets kinda lonely. I have no one to talk to face to face. The only real friend i have is Francesca and she lives a walking distance a way but too far to walk by myself.Oh how i wish i were outside. But im alil off when i walk over there at night. It really freaks me out. Not because there's crazy people out or rapists or whatever but because....its just weird. Things in the trees the full moon(too beautiful to believe) and just...a cool wind. I always have to look behind my shoulder just to see if anyone was following.  Ya...i'll go to the mall with ya. Maybe I could 'maybe' ask my mom if she'll take us to Avalon...its a store full of wicca and witchcraft..celtic u know..the works. That would be alot of fun.  Is thursday alright?..u need to call me-franny   So bored and sad.:(
