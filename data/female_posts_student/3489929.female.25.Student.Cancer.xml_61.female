I'll only have to work 20-25 hours a week, and I'll probably end up at Winn-Dixie. Which is fine- I worked there before, for all of two months, right before I started working at the current company.  My dad is happy I am going to be in school again. He keeps telling me he's proud that I made the decision myself, applied for everything myself, etc. We talked a lot about what I'm going to do, and family stuff, and then John and I watched a movie on my dad's portable DVD player (although we didn't finish it,  Die Another Day  was pretty decent).  All in all, it was a nice trip. We buzzed campus- there is a hella lot of construction going on because they are expanding, but everything I remember is still there (frankly, I'm surprised at just how much I do remember). Then Dad got hungry for steak as we started back, and we had to drive all the way to Tuscaloosa to find a decent one (at Buddy's, which is an Alabama fan's wet dream, what with all the tributes to the Bear).  I learned that my dad drives like a grandma on the interstate, which I guess is good since he hasn't gotten a ticket in years, but is a shame because he's got such a hot car (brand-new cherry-red Mustang- you just try and tell me that's not a midlife crisis car).  I also learned today that my cousin, who used to be a pilot for American Eagle, is now the pilot for the Auburn University athletic division, which means he flies Tommy Tuberville and his staff all over the country to wherever they need to go. Even though I hate airplanes, how cool is that job?  My fear of airplanes goes way back. I've never gotten on one, and I don't plan to any time soon. If that keeps me from experiencing certain things... that's regrettable, but my fear of the plane ride would ruin any trip I took anyway. My phobia really irritates my cousin- he's offered to take me up himself on my first plane ride, and when I decline, he gets insulted, like he thinks   I   think he'll kill me. It's not that I don't trust him. But if man were meant to fly, wouldn't God and/or natural selection have given us wings? I'm just saying...  Anyway. It's getting closer. Two more weeks and then I'm  gone .  Pfwing!
