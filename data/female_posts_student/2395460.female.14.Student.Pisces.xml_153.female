Of course seeing an ominous black cross on a screen through a VR helmet while having your feet burned is not the same as lying in a hospital bed, but the researchers are hopeful that they're onto a drug-free method of pain control.  Incidentally, the SnowWorld screenshots look remarkably similar to an old RealNetworks screensaver called Snowglobes:     Next time I have a migraine, I'll turn it on and put my face real close to the screen, which I hope is something like virtual reality.
