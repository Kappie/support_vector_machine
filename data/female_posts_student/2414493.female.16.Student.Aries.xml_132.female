Somehow the hours slipped by yesterday, but I also sense that I personally don't think this is going to hold up too long. Then again, how hard could it really be? With a little more effort, I will cover all the history material, prep for bio, and do enough lit practice tests to get me into testing mode.  Deep down, this doesn't bother me. It's not like I truly miss conversations with people just as busy as I am, and studying does me good. It's just getting used to it: like getting rid of people, almost. And here I laugh. So in a figurative sense, I'm going through withdrawal: who could not appreciate such an efficient system for styaing in touch? for socializing at the click of a button? AIM isn't necessary at all, but I've just been hooked on it for such a long time that I can't stop. A personal sense of victory is also driving me: Lydia, offline, for a whole entire day!  I can already predict that the most disheartening part of the day will be taking that practice test. I've also calculated that I can only take one a day before I a) go insane and more practically, b) run out of practice tests.  I just need something trifling to keep me busy. Listening to music now, which helps. I'm always tempted to munch away at something, but that's obviously not a healthy habit. Thankfully, there's really nothing good in the kitchen except pudding. It's silly: it used to be that when I had a lot to do, I wouldn't eat since I was just too busy with other things. But now, I want nothing more than to continually munch away, and that's not a good sign.  Weekend plans, since I always forget: Anna's birthday party on Saturday. I'm kind of hesitant to go but I already told her I would. I didn't ask her to mine (but I didn't ask Nigel either, so there) and it just seems kind of impolite. I used to be pretty close to her since the crux of our friendship was always that we were a year younger, and two days apart at that. But there things fork. She almost reminds me of that girl in A Walk to Remember: church, choir, hard-working. She's the only person I know who observes the Sabbath by doing no work on Sunday. Her mom's very nice; I saw her at Bach Festival. And I can't say that I'm as pure and straightforward as she is. I almost feel bad when people like Jordan mock "Can we say hi to Shelby?"  On a side note, I don't respect Nicholas Sparks as an author. Maybe as a storyteller. I can't believe I even read A Walk. Oversentimental rubbish, I say.  Saturday. Ballard study session, maybe, but if I can't keep interest on a normal day in his class I don't know what a good four hours will do. Sunday: CWOTO, 3:30pm. It's been a while, I missed the last two concerts, one because I plumb forgot and another on account of being away for the summer. I swear I had more to do than that, but that's ok too. It's the last weekend before the SATIIs, anyway.  To work, to work.
