There, covered in a black velvet cape I waited oh so quietly for them to appear. I shivered, my breath a frostly cloud as I looked up at the sky. The moon was covered by dark black clouds, the stars hiding out of fear. Tonight was a good night for following, hardly any light. A lone owl hooted softly in the distance, it's cry traveling softly in ripples across the forest. Then I saw it. Only a pinprick of light at first, then more and more as their torches grew nearer. Where were they getting the flame? I wondered silently. They voices grew shrill and mocking, closer and closer they came. I tried to crouch lower, digging my fingernails into the old soil. I saw them approach slow motion, like out of a nightmare. I had never been this close, I could smell their rotting flesh, almost feel their greasy, torn hair. They screached and bellowed. I saw Lily, oh my dear sweet Lily look up to my window. She looked almost saddened not to see me, and for a fraction of a second I thought I saw emotion. They had become more violent recently, once in a while ripping one of their own to shreds, leaving us the dissarayed carcas the next morning. This evening they went for Lisa Ann, the prom queen. Always a beauty, I watched as four of them jumped on her, I listened to her barbaric screams, I watched eyeballs being ripped away from their sockets, hair pulled straight from the head, I heard the loud crack of her neck as it snapped in two. I felt her pain as a silent tear slid down my pale face, falling quietly onto the grass. They grew bored of this, and after a few hours they retreated into the early hours. I had watched, noticing they never looked back once, but I still kept out of sight as I followed behind. Always keeping them just within eye reach. Deep within the forest we trudged. They grew silent, and lurched quickly, almost galloping to their destination. Then we came to it and I stopped dead. It had been so obvious, so cliche so apparent and we had all just forgotten. How could we have forgotten about The Mayson Residence, deep within the forest. Old hermit Mayson we had called him, it had always been a joke within the Windsor kids that one day they were going to storm his house and throw a huge party. How ironic I thought as I stood there, wind whipping my face as I watched them reel into the old castle. It was dilapidated, the stone and wood groaning from age and wear. The perfect place to hide I thought bitterly. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts, I didn't realize I had walked into the front lawn of the vast estate. I heard a window bang and looked up sharply. Lily leaned out of a second story window, gaping smile, eyes boring into my soul. "Meredith!" She called in a deep sing- song voice, eyes glittering blankly. She leaned out of the window, her arms thrust towards me. "Come join us Merry! You always were my favorite!" I felt my knees give out, I licked my lips- dry and chapped form the cold winter wind. "No" I said quietly, a whisper at most. I fell to my knees, looking up at her. I heard them running down the stairs, so did she. Her eyes bulged, she did not expect them to find me. I was her, her prize, her possession. I looked up at her smiling. "Another time my old friend" I said sweetly, and then spit at the ground below her. Rising, I looked up into her eyes and she howled a dark, monstrous groan. I turned around and ran, arms and legs pumping from adrenaline. I stopped to see them halt at the door, for already the sun had begin to awaken. They grew angry and frusturated, their bodies lurched with anger. They threw one young man I didn't recognize onto the lawn in front of them. He screamed and tried to make it back inside, crawling slowly as his flesh melted off his bones. His carcass steamed and hissed and bubbled and oozed and diluted grey flesh fell like rivers off his dying body. Then, all at once the horrible screaming stopped. I looked in shock to the others where they hid inside the doorway, the sunlight not quite up to the doorstep. They looked at me, smiling a knowing smile. They weren't crazy, I thought, just sick. I walked quietly back to the WIndsor Mansions, engrossed in thought. Somehow I would make them pay, somehow I would watch them all die, slowly and with a great satisfaction. I would watch as Lily cowarded under my wrath, and with her last dying breath she would call for me, and I would sit just out of her reach, smiling and singing her lullaby- just for her.
