Hehe, not really.... well I'm not sure about the mental side! It was sooo much fun, but the guy running it was so sexist! The pig! He kept going on about how all the boys would want to destroy things and the girls like to do flowers. So on ours, we destroyed every thing. ;) Well we had to show him didn't we? Hehe! It was me, Izzy, this girl, a guy called Ben and another guy called Joe. I yapped to Ben and Joe loads (well what else would I do?) We talked about erm... locking some one in a locker and stuff. (Highly technical) They were fun! They go to Backwell though. Oh, we got a video of what we did! It's funny! A whole day for two and a half minutes of moving plasticine! Aaargh! Oh well, it was work it!
