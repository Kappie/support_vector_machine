She said they werent contagious, but this morning I come to find out that it is, and I had those little kids coughing on me all day. The last thing I need is to be sick. Those kids are so cute, but they follow me in the bathroom and stand right over me as I pee and Emily kept hitting my boobs all day and giggling. That got really annoying. Then I came straight to practice, which is just hell in itself. The guys can sit around and goof off or jack off or whatever the hell they want and Mr. Davis would never speak a word to them. But when the girls try to figure out where we go after a number we havent blocked the exit of-oh hell no, its a completely different story, we get bitched up and down. But it has always been that way and probably always will, so what can you do. Most of the time when he yells specifically at me, it makes me really want to prove that i'm not fucking retarded, but nights like tonight, i just wanted to say fuck it and get the hell out of there. On top of that, my dad comes in at, oh, lets say 8:00 and just sits there and since good ole Robby Davis said that practices would last till 10 or 11, i told him to go home. Well when I call at 9:15, my mom said,"you're dad said he wasnt coming to get you." I just thought, 'what the crap, no one wants to take me home. he has no choice.' so my dad starts arguing with me and telling me i can stay up there all night and wont let me talk to mom about it and mom wont just put her foot down and tell hard headed mark whatley to get his ass in the car. But its fine now... i'm just really stressed out. On a different note, I have a crush on someone. He thinks I'm retarded, I'm pretty sure, but hey thats okay. Sara and I are already planning how we're going to seduce our guys. When she calls me at 11:37 we're going to figure out our next move for tomorrow, since there wasnt one for today, it sucked. I thought I had otned down my flirting, well okay, i tried, kind of..but Kim says I'm still bad, and someone even called me a slut, but she wont let me name who. Me, a slut? Thats  crazy ..
