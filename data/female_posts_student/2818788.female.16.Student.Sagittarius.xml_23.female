Well it's a RP thing where DM puts us in stupid situations, and then we do stupid things. hiemdoshuevos: And then at the end you have to fight the dwarf, and you cannot win against the dwarf. hiemdoshuevos: Anyway. hiemdoshuevos: I chose, this game, to be Vannah White. Don't ask me why. I don't know. SelketRune: Wait, you were in Vannah White? hiemdoshuevos: No, I chose to RP -as- Vannah White. Like, she was my character. SelketRune: Oooooo! SelketRune: Okay. Continue. hiemdoshuevos: And throughout the entire game I kept collecting letters from things. Whenever I saw something with a letter on it, I took a letter from it. SelketRune: **Snickers** hiemdoshuevos: At the end, I'm staring down the Dwarf, and I still have the letters W, L, A, and N. hiemdoshuevos: So I use these letters to spell the word "LAWN", and cover The Dwarf with grass. He then caught fire. SelketRune: .....And? And?! hiemdoshuevos: He put himself out and then shot me in the face with a shotgun. hiemdoshuevos: Like I said, you can't beat The Dwarf."
