Yep, that's right lol such a famous choir I'm in [*rolls eyes*]. If anyone does watch it then I am the one with the dark short hair and most likely a hair ribbon. but I think a total of three people (one being anonymous but sounding awfully familiar...!) that read this blog occaisionally that there will not be many people watching. oh well it's still a bit exciting.       Oh and after sleeping on those lines I wrote in my last post, I realized that with a select group of people I know (not family at all, sad but true) I have separation anxiety like a little kid. and that day that i posted one of the people closest to me left and I'm really really really missing them right now. and I will for a long time. because I know that I won't see them ever again in my life. And God only knows if I'll see them in heaven.
