Today is a very special day that everyone celebrates “New Years Eve”. Today is the day that baby girl turns 23. Today is my special day. Today I get to blow out 23 candles on my cake. Today, people will sing me happy birthday.    Thank you mom and dad, for giving me this special day. Thank you for making me such a strong person. Thank you for your encouragements. Thank you for giving me strengths to carry on.  Thank you for being my parents. Thank you for everything.    For those of you who remembered my birthday, thank you all, you guys are the best and there is no other way that I can say thank you but to kiss you on both cheeks and give you lots of hugs.    For those of you who don’t remember FUCK YOU. You guys are so unimportant to me. And you’re not my friend that’s for sure.     My new year is going to start off with a formal ball. It’s going to be an amazing event. Massive balloon drop, champaige toast, many free drinks. This is when all the girls go wild hahahha.
