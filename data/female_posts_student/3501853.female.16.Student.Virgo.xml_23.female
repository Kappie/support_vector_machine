It was like a normal conversation for a while then he asked who I like and he guessed the answer right and he's like ur hung up on him and I was gonna explain why I was but then I felt bad but of course he made me say it after that haha so I told him how for those 2 yrs that we were like on and off I've liked probably around 7 guys but none of them ever got to me to the point where they got me over j but then all of a sudden he came and that was it, it was done. I felt bad saying it afterwards cuz it was awkward after that and I prolly sounded bitchy but it's the truth. And argh, I"m just so fucking retarded. Anyways then I went to j's house before I went to work so he could sign my yearbook. I was proud of myself, I did not get lost going to his new house. Okay his new house is fucking huge. It goes on forever and ever. He's got a couch in his room, his basement is like double mine, his pool is humongous and he's got a bar next to it. The kid turned into like a millionaire. I saw Julie, she was a sweet girl, I miss her. Anyways, I only stayed for the tour of the house so like 3 minutes literally then we went outside so he could sign my yearbook. I knew it was going to be short cuz that's just his style, he doesn't reveal his feelings and he's too lazy 2 write wut he does feel or the memories so he drew this tiny lil picture. Then I went to work...work was pretty good actually. Jaysen got me pad thai so that was good. It reminded me of him. Then me and Kristen were talking about shopping and that reminded me of the other him. And a lot of stuff reminded me of her even Armando's new patio set he was talking about did cuz we had a talk on a patio set once. And I was all smiley while I was thinking all that but I felt pressure on my chest and stuff and as Mr. Claus calls it, anxiety attacks haha he's weird ti's not anxiety attacks when u get pressure on ur chest. It's like I was laughing and smiling but I'm like crying on the inside. Cuz I'd rather be smiling and laughign with them than anything else but I probably won't ever get that again cuz I'm duuumb. Well I don't want to write about this anymore, it's enough thinking going on as it is, well I'm gonna go watch the lakers game now.."Even those who never frown, eventually break down"-lp
