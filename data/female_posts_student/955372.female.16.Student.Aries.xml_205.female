When we were eating, laurel does the little "roar" motion with her hand but says "word" tres amusant. Yeah. woot. Good times. Yeah so anyway, yesterday my dad got back from arizona and gave me these nifty earings. Yeah and then he showed us all these pictures from this college thing that frank lloyd wright started. It was coolish. He was all you should go there. And i'm like yeah and live in the middle of a dessert for four years to study architecture which i have absolutely no intrest in, especially Frank Lloyd Wright's stuff. He had a few good things, like Falling Water. But yeah thats about it. Anyway he went on for a millenia about that. And then he's like yeah well i have to get a new computer from the company. And i'm like can i have your old one and he was all "no it belongs to the company" a crushing disappointment, because if i got the computer i would never have to come down here and have people constantly looking over my shoulder. I could be up in privacy in my room on my montrousity of a bed.
