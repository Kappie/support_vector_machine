My Kyle (well hes not really "my" kyle but i like to think so i love him to death) was in town for 1 day. He lives in San fransisco now and is in college. I hadnt seen him in a year, and i thought about him all the time and missed him like nothing else. So he had family stuff yesterday and so today before he left he came by to see me. I was so happy, happier than words can say. He pulled up, i ran out side and jumped on him and gave him the biggest hug. I was so happy to see him. We talked a little about how i had changed (for the better i might add...:-) ) and what we were doin and all that good stuff, and then he had to go. And thats when i had my first burst of courage, i kissed him, which wasnt really that big of a deal caused i had kissed him before, but it was kinda differnt. So then we said our good byes and he left...i almost cried. Then i go inside and dont no why but i text #3 and i told him i liked him, i didnt get a text back....but at least i did it and he knows from me now. So that was the second outta the blue brave thing i did today. Then i hung out with Vince, chilled, it was fun fun fun!  lol Then im eating cookies with my dad and all of the sudden hes like oh yea! i got #2's e-mail adress. im like wtf? really? why? and hes just like i dunno i thought u might want it if u didnt have it, and so he gave it to me, and i just emailed him. i gave him my #, all that good stuff told him we should hang out ect. ect. so yea, courage thing #3. I hope somthing comes outta any of those things, casue i put my self out there, and i wasnt scared, still not scared of whats ganna go down. you no i guess something already has come outta those things, i got over my fear (for now at least lol).
