Standing here looking out my window My nights are long and my days are cold Cause I don't have you How can I be so damn demanding? I know you said that it's over now But I can't let go Every day I want to pick up the phone And tell you that  You're everything I need and more If only I could find you Like a cold Summer afternoon Like the snow coming down in June Like a wedding without a groom I'm missing you I'm the desert without the sand I'm the one without a band I'm a ring without a hand I'm missing you Driving 'round thought I saw you pass me My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me Cause you fade away Maybe I'm just hallucinating Cause my loneliness got the best of me  And my heart's so weak   love it. well.. todays list: waiting for: ricky sal joe brian n dana to get back from the mall. roseanna to get back from ikea. cara to call me after work. my mom to get off. to go to starbucks and be spontaneous. this cd to finish uploading. dustin to e-mail me back... i don't like this list. i hate waiting.  christine.
