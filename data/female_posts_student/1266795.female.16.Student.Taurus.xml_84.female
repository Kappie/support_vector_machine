I'm wearing a pink shrit!!!! :-D  On to the quote of the day: Toute musique qui ne peint rien n'est que du bruit. A lovely quote. You can get the normal amount of points for translation and source. Speaking of points: Alison: 740 Michael: 520 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Jonah: 320 Sarah and Evan: 160 Ah, and the last quote was "Noli turbare circulos meos!" Which does in fact mean, don't upset my circles! It was supposedly said by Archimedes in deep thoughts over geometrical shapes drawn in the sand at the moment a soldier of the conquering Roman army broke into his house and slew him. Lovely, right? Ah well. Have fun with the next one. Don't worry. I don't believe it has anything to do with someone being slew over geometry. Next order of business, my grandfather's coming out sooner than expected. He'll either be here later this evening or early tomorrow. yay. Ah well. I love him. I truly do. I'm a bit worried about him meeting Nathan....(I want him to, but if the thought strikes him, he can be scarier than my mother....) Ah well. It should be interesting if nothing else.   "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."
