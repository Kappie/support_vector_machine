Turns out, and asteroid's headed for Earth, and has a possibilty to hit (1/1'000.000 [sorry wrote that in European style]).  Just so you may shit your pants in the meanwhile, be sure to watch some wholesome family movies such as "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact".  Even if it will hit...it'll take it 12 years to get here....HURRY UP ALREADY!  In any fucking case, what is there to write about, when you don't do anything at all all day? Hm...well you guessed it, not much, just garbage, and empty talk. Just 44 more hrs total till I get the rest of the Trigun seires, not factoring in all the slowdowns, dl cancells, and lack of sources...in which case its more like months than hours...ridiculous really.  By the way, a George Forman GrillÂ®  would  make an excellent addition to a dream room, especially when combined with a mini-fridge, and the rest of the crap that'll make it heaven.  I'm Deadinside, and that's my deathwish.  "She's the girl who can make all the boys cry"
