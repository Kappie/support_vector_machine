There are things I could do, should do but aren't and won't.   Anyway, about the movie. Here in the middle of nowhere there is only one theatre close enough and it only plays 3 movies at a time and they are "Barbarshop 2" (ew) "You've Got Served" (haven't heard of it but it has B2K in it, so definetly no) and then "Catch That Kid" which I haven't heard of either and haven't heard anything about. So I can't go to a movie. I just have to sit here counting the minutes until I can fall asleep.  I'm pretty sure we'll go to school tomorrow. Heck, we could be in school now. That's why I wish I could go to the cinema, because the roads are just dandy.   Ah, I was going to say something but I don't remember what exactly.    Music: "Blue Period" - Kind of like Spitting
