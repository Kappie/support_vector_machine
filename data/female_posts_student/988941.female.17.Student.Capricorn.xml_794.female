I can't believe it, a few years ago I stopped art, I thought that was the end of my colouring in days - but oh no, geography today, drawing maps. Green for land, blue for sea - logical you see. One step ahead of the game. Business  Economics as well, stuff about the shop Spar (private joke for Jo, SPPAAARRRRRRRRR!). More geography for the other one, Coombes. First media studies lesson today - very cool, looks like fun! Period 5 today quite a few people had a free and not many could be bothered to do any work at the end of the day, so sat in the common room. Tasha was having a conversation with Penny and Helen, and the whole room went quiet for some reason (you know what I mean, it just does) and all you could hear was Tasha saying "are we talking testicals?" Rather amusing I must say. Have you guys seen that stupid sign the upper sixth put up about us? First day in school and instantly we get blammed for the mess in the common room. No lower sixth went in the common room because they were all to scared of the upper sixth! Silly people. I think it's quite sweet the way the whole room has divided itself between upper and lower, straight down the middle. Poor Nicki still hasn't got her computer working yet, so she's probably reading this in school at lunch - hi Nicki!
