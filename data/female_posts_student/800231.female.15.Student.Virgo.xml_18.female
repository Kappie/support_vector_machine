She flat out called me stupid to my face, told me I was struggling. Fuck her, I'm haven't even been trying but, I'm certainly not struggling. So what if I don't do anything in class, I was the only one who aced the finals! She should've called me lazy, at least that was true. By the end of our little discussion she was giving me that "You're a fucktard so I'll go easy on you" look. I was two seconds from piercing her jugular with my teeth... Unfair, I think I'll change my schedule form, nothing stopping me.  I spent 2 hours of my afternoon sitting on the front lawn of our school listening to the orchestra practice. People insulting me affects me far too much. Last year some kid insulted me in the hallway and Steph and I slammed him into the lockers so hard the back of his head was bleeding. I've become far too violent these past few years, I hate hurting people. I have a very fragile ego and I just lose it when someone goes too far.   Besides the whole math issue everything is good. I was in a camera store tonight looking at random eqiupment when some guy approached me and asked me for my opinion on some of his shots. Guy had the coolest picture ever, it was the sun setting over an ice covered lake. Totally spinky! Anyway, he thought I made a good call on his shot. I love photography... Maybe could be a professional some day? My teacher seems to think I have talent.
