He or She is quite active in there. I wonder if it was the jelly beans I just ate!?!? It's good to feel the baby move. It's always very reassuring.   Caden is at Grandma Patty's this evening. Mommy needed a few hours to herself to get some stuff up on eBay (starting that again) and to rest a little bit. He's so active as well lately.
