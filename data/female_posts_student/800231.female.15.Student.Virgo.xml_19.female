Anyway, Ms. L had the new TV on a rolling stand and when she tried to move it this morning she just knocked the entire thing over. It made this huge "KABOOM!" noise and the screen just disintegrated into dust, smoke and lots of broken glass. We all just sat around stunned in the smoke while other teachers in our corridor came in to ask who'd been shot. Yes, it was that loud. Then one student pointed out that the silver dust leaking from the screen was probably carcinogenic and we should leave. So as we're all walking out the door Ms. L stops and asks her student teacher to stay behind and sweep everything and LEAVES him locked in a room full smoke. Who else thinks that was incredibly cruel? We came back 50 minutes later to find him kneeling in broken glass and choking. Ms. L is such a sweet person...  I think its a bit of a shame that John Kerry has been such an unstoppable force among the democratic candidates. Out of all the candidates I liked him the least. I know he's more likely to win against Bush but still, Dean could've been so much better for the country. I think it's time for a bit more change then Kerry is offering us. Then again, I can't legally vote so my opinion doesn't matter. Bah.  I was in a book store earlier when I got a call from Helen. She wanted to know what the homework for LA was and I had no idea. All I knew was that we were supposed to be reading the last chapter of  Siddhartha .  Eventually we figured out that we were supposed to be answering some random question on the meaning of life. Helen was trying to tell me what happened in the last chapter so I could help her do her homework but she was really confused. Finally she asked me why Govinda just gets up and walks away from Siddhartha and I said rather loudly "Cuz Govinda 's a poo!" and everyone around me just turned to stare. I feel special...
