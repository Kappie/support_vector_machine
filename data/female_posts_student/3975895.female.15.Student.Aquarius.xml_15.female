Sometimes, maybe even the people who are closeest to you arent trustworthy. I guess I think too much. Go too indepth when I think, making things seems so comlpicated to me even though it can the simpliest thing ever.    As each day passes, I learn more things about life. Sometimes, it ends up in disappointment, sometimes it ends up with encouragement. I wonder how I would be,  WHO  I would be, if certain things in my life that never took place. Would I still be the same Vivian I am now? I seem to have lost trust in a lot of people, I feel that I can't trust them anymore. I can't tell them things like I used to be able to. They seem to be all changing into a whole new person that I totally don't like. I'm scared, I truly am. I just wanna go back to my invisibleness. Then noone can see me, and I can't see anyone. Build myself 4 big walls secluding myself, where I won't fel pain or hurt. Maybe that'll be better for me, and other people. Going to the stupid dentist today, he's going to cry, but whatever, who the hell cares.
