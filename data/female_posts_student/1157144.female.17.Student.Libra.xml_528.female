From now on Blogger will second as a dream journal, but only real dreams, and dreams that the person finds significant.  Now, I kid you not, but I had this dream: It was sorta late at a KFC.  I was having an eating contest with three other guys and we were all eating chicken wings.  They all got spicy sauce and I got normal, I found out later that I didn't like the taste of normal.  The people in the contest were Corey Valdez, someone I don't know, and Brian Leong (s/p?).  Before we started Laura and Brian showed up together.  Coinciding with the above, i didn't like the normal wings so I went to the counter to get some chicken wind dipping sauce.  As I came back I found some sort of person there that was whispering to the occupants of the booth that were in the eating contest.  I felt incredibly angry and sad, like this guy was whispering about me and talking crap about me, oh well, in the dream I didnt' seem to care because I sat right back down!  Alright, now I didn't get to see the end of the eating contest but in dreams you go from one place, quickly to another, and mine are usually like that so bear with me!  Suddenly I'm walking home and is about sunset.  I walk up to my house and this really hot mustange (car) is sitting on my lawn.  I don't know who has one but it was neon blue and the license plate i forgot exactly, but it was something like ROSANNA'S RIGHT.  I have no idea who Rosanna is, or what the means, but whatever.  I walk up to the frong door of the drivers seat and I look into it, now, bare with me...  The inside of the car was dark and inside Laura Salcido was on top of Brian Leong.  They were fully clothed but were doing something that appeared to be making out.   Laura and Brian saw me and Laura yelled and blushed while Brian just sat there and blushed.  Suddenly I am in the car trying to get out.  Laura and Brian are trying to hold me in, but I really wanted to get out.  We were all yelling and my dad came out.  My dad was wearing wacky clothing and just looked at us and said to "keep it down".  BOOM, I wake up, done deal. I have weird dreams and I wasnt making this up.  Plan for some more dreams to be put into blogger.     It's HAMMER TIME!
