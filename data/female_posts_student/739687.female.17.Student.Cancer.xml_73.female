Yeah, so we didn't have practice today, but we had good old sectionals of course. Wednesday we don't have anything....oh wait..no. I have LESSONS! Of course, I get no days off. But that's ok...it's better than being up at the school until like 7 on a Wednesday evening. Because that is always oodles of fun. Anyways though, I'm gonna go study for my French oral tomorrow and that other crazy test we have in that class. Au revoir!
