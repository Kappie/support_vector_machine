Well then we went down to see the horses and they followed us down and all four of us just stood there not talk at all. The boys were boys that me and Donna met two years ago and   there names are Jon and Dillion, creepy right!   Well it turns out that they were pretty hott. We went down the next day and hung with them some more. The cool thing is they might move somewhere around here in the next few years. to bad they are only gonna be here a few more days. Well today we are gonna go see them again and thats all for now.    *Jess and Sam*
