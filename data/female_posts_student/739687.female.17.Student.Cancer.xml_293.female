I don't think it's  not  touched my shoulders since I was 6. Seriously.  I'd give an in-depth rundown of the past few days, but it's too much to say, and I doubt that many people care to hear every detail of what I've been up to. Basically, I've just been working out and hanging out with people. But what is there really to do otherwise? You get the idea. Nothing's been all too exciting. I wanna work out today, and I really feel like going bowling tonight.  Well, I don't have too much to say that's actually substancial...but who needs substance when things can be simple? If you ask me, sometimes life has too much substance. But only because people create it. Half the troubles we endure originate from our own imagination. That may not seem logical, but it's true. We just create dilemmas in our head that in actuality, don't exist.  I think I'm gonna go find some way of wasting time.  See you crazies later.
