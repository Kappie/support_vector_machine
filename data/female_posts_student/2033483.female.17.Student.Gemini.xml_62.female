Just two more hours that all I wanted!  But NOOO....I had to LEARN!  I'm not going to waste space with an overview of my day because it was really boring.    I had AP review session tonight, surprisingly it went by faster then class normally does.  So that was good.  Came home to homework so yeah...that's a wonderful cycle of school, homework, sleep, school, homework, sleep....   ID badges and why mine gives me panic attacks:  I think I'm one of the few students who has never forgotten their ID badge and has never been privileged enough to wear the cool neon green sticker for a day.  But because of a faulty clip at the beginning of the year which would always unfasten and let my ID fall to the ground whenever it darn well pleased, I'm plagued with constantly checking to see if my ID is at my hip.  Several instances have brought this up.  During a recent outing to the mall, on a Saturday, I glanced down and noticed my ID wasn't there.  Well, duh, it's a Saturday it's not supposed to be.  But for about a half of a second my heart skipped a beat while I had a brief panic attack about where my ID was at.  Don't worry I quickly recovered and remembered it was Saturday and laughed at myself.  But the best is yet to come.  I went to go throw my tray away, in one of the garbage cans in the hall because I don't eat in the cafeteria.  Normally, on my way back to the room from getting my food, I place my ID on my tray because my hands are full and I can't hook it back on right away.  After I through my tray away, I noticed I didn't have my ID on.  I froze dead in my tracks staring at the garbage can  This is where I had another panic attack after I realized what I had done.  OMG!  I just through my ID away!  I wasn't about to go digging through the garbage can to look for it.  Do you know what's in the garbage?  Neither do I.  Once I started breathing again I thought maybe, just maybe I took it off the tray today.  This was a very slight possibility but it was worth a shot.  I literally, walked briskly back into the room.  I wasn't going to run are you kidding me there were people in the hall and I didn't want to look like an even bigger dork.  I mean come on I was staring at the garbage can forever half expecting it to say "woops you need this" and spit it back at me.  But as soon as the door closed behind me I ran to my desk and thank God laying face down was my beautiful ID!  This is just two cases of why my ID has caused me much anxiety.  I understand why the school board is making us wear them but mine is causing me more stress then I think it's worth.    Thank you for reading....leave a message or else......the ID will get you! ~Kay
