First, Megan picked up Ann and me, because I'm to lazy to drive to Westerville/I refuse to drive all over this country to get to a sleepover. Anna called me during our drive up. She told me that Norman had sent her an e-mail and said he missed us! Well, probably just her, but I pretend like it was us. Norman is from Lylah and we stayed at the Super 6 with him in Dallas. P.S. Anna and I are going to find that number and call TK and STALKKKKK HIM! HE'S MY LOVAHHH! Then we got to Trisha's and her sister showed me the Sims, cause I don't know much about that game. Then we read some magazines and waited for Margaret to get there. We ordered Chinese food, and refused to let Trisha drive to get it, since she's strict and doesn't allow fun in the car! These customers questioned me about my Sirius Black shirt. Trisha and I played with this video screen and tried to make up orders, but it didn't work. We went back and put in  Van Wilder  and ate some Chinese food. I spilled sweet  sour sauceall overher Spongebob pillow- oops I got into trouble! There was rice and sauce EVERYWHERE! Then we kept getting scolded about being too loud. We were loud the whole night. We watched  Office Space , but didn't watch  Cold Mountain , the entire purpose of the sleepover! We played the figure 8 game, that was good times. Ann suggested getting crazy and going out and TPing something! Trisha said no. We were going to climb out her window, but again she said no. So we went to bed. Ann had a dentist appointment, so we had to leave at like 8. "First and Last!" HAHA Megan!    I babysat Thursday night and then drove up to Cleveland. I got in around 10:15, and both my aunts were sleeping. See, nobody could go to Cleveland Warped with me. So I wasn't going to go, but my aunt Sally came in from Maine and wanted me todrive up andvisit. So I decided to drive up and go to the show by myself, I'd always wanted to anyways. The next morning I talked to my aunt Sally for a while and then got ready for the show. I left and got in around 11:30. Okay, you have to pay $10 to park and then walk 6 miles to get to the show. You have to climb down cliffs and cross roads, it's dangerous and evil! Though my ticket said 12, Allister was playing while I made me trek to the entrance. I got inside and went to find the big schedule. Big? Try it was a quarter of the size of the one in Texas. You couldn't see it over people's heads! I wrote down the times of people I wanted to see, of course everyone was overlapping! That's why you have to go to several shows, or you'll never see everything! The first thing I wanted to see was Matchbook Romance, at 1:15, of course Sugarcult was at 1:30- don't you just love that luck! So I walked around to the booths during my wait. I needed to know when The Matches were playing, but I couldn't find their booth! I walked around like 6 times before I found it. Their merch guy- kinda cute. Gorgeous blue eyes, not usually my favorite, but gorgeous! He was like, "How are you doing?" and I said fine and asked him the same and he goes, "Well I'm fine now. " LOVER. Then, Jon, I freaking worship that kid, runs up to me:    Jon: "Do you have any heroin or cocaine?!"    Me: "Uhhh... no."    Jon: "Nothing?I need something!"    Me: "I have some gum."    Jon: "Is it nicorette? Cause I need something STRONG!"    Me: "How come every time I see you you are talking about cocaine?"    Jon: "I just really need some."    Then I was looking at their shirts, and I decided I wanted to buy one. So I told Jon I wanted the red one, and he goes, "What about this shirt. Will you buy the shirt I'm wearing?" WHAT?! Buy the shirt off your back?? I told him I didn't know. He goes, "Okay, both shirts for $20. I really love this shirt, but I want to sell it to you." So I did, he peeled it right off his body and handed it to me. He wrote a note on it in silver sharpie about how poor he is. That kid is so funny.    I went over to watch MBR. Those kids in the crowd got K-RAZY. Did you like that? I just made it up. Andy walks on in big Aviator glasses. Judas and Aaron buzzed their heads. Aaron looks good, but Judas betrayed Jesus, so he looked like the asshole that he always is! Ryan, I think is the bassist, has always been cute. They played pretty well. Andy has a huge, thick pink guitar strap, which was pretty hot. I tried to take pictures. I ran back to try and catch the end of Sugarcult. I heard the very end of "Bouncing Off the Walls Again" and then I heard "Okay, see ya later!" So I ran back to go see The Matches, but I couldn't find the stage, so I had to ask the merch guy. They didn't get a stage, just two blue tents. They deserve much more! This guy was complaining that they weren't on a stage, it was bad, they were for Texas. AND they only played 4 songs- what the fuck?! I stood right in front of the speaker. Justin fell and knocked the tent down. Stuff was flying everywhere. Shawn looked AMAZING with his tan and salmon colored shirt. AMAZING. I got a guitar pic. Then I saw that kid that I saw at Flanagan's. I went up and tried to talk to him and he was such a jerk! He was like, "I don't know, I'm from New York." OKay, you're not hot enough to be such a jack ass! But still, The Matches are awesome and I wouldn't want to talk to some random girl over Jon either! Then I went to the FYE booth to get my Matches t-shirt signed. Oh, well I was wearing my "Bert is MY Homeboy" shirt, and a million people commented on it! Anyways, I gave my t-shirt to Shawn to sign and he goes, "I like your shirt!" I was so flattered, since you know he makes his own clothes, and I go, "Thanks! I really like all your designs." Then he signed my shirt, and his signature is really cool, and I said, "Wow your signature is awesome." The drummer was like, "Mine or his?" and I go, "Uhh.. both!" Then Shawn said, "Well, we just like everything about each other, don't we?" and gave a little wink! Dude is so hot. Then I went to get in line for Taking Back Sunday. I mean, going through that line is kind of pointless, you don't get to talk to them, and I have already done it, but Adam is just so dreamy! I saw these girls that I saw when I went to see MBR and FOB. We talked a bit. I told him about how Desiree is trying to steal Ace and how I despise her. There was another girl who was FREAKing out to see TBS. Finally, the line moved and we went in for the kill. I am obsessed with the screamer, I always get the names confused, but he is always just so nice! One guy said he liked my shirt. I waved at Adam, who was wearing a camo shirt and a smile. They had these stickers out, and one guy told me to grab one, even though I told him I already took a bunch, then the last guy goes, "Take one, Bert would want you to." Bert- you made me loved that day, and I owe you so much.    THEN I went to go get some MBR stuff signed. That line was crazy, people always choose to walk in front of ME, why?? I almost said something, but the next person to do it was Matt from The Matches, good thing I held my tongue. They had a poster they signed. Ryan asked everybody their name, and then wrote it in the corner:    Ryan: "Who should I make this out to?"    Me: "Allison, with two L's!"    Ryan: "Of course, how else would you spell it?! One L SUCKS!"    Aaron, wearing an "Everybody Loves a Jewish Boy" t-shirt (kid is INDIAN!), pointed to my shirt and was like, "I love your shirt!" then he tapped Judas and was like, "Judas, Judas, I like her shirt!" Judas was super unfriendly to everybody. Andy was kind of nice, but sitting right behind him was that HORRIBLE girlfriend of his. Then I turn around and who do I spy? FUCKING DESIREE! I was like, "What are YOU doing here?!" But I was nice. SHe goes, "Well Andy knows I want a picture, so he told me to just wait here!" I walked away, turned around, tapped her on the table and said, "Desiree, did I tell you I went to TEXAS to see The Early November?!?!" She was like, "Oh no, good for you!" And I go, "All for Ace, baby!" Apparently, a friend of hers took a picture of Joe for her. Right, cause a picture is the EXACT same thing as fucking them on their tour bus. Yeah, I think I win! TAKE THAT BEEYATCH. Then I walked around a little and saw some Hidden In Plain View. I needed to change the film in my aunt's camera, but I'm not going to lie, I don't know how. The kid from Noise Ratchet said he could do it, of course, two shots later and the whole roll rewound. Right, damnreligious kidsfuck up everything! JUSTTTTT kidding!Then I watched Dynamite Boy. They were good. I talked to, I think it's Sam, earlier in the day. Love that kid- he hooked me and Liz up to meeting FOB, back when their fans weren't so god damn obnoxious. Then I walked with those girls to go watch New Found Glory, which was good. Then I lost them and hung out with myself until 8 to see Taking Back Sunday. I had entered a drawing, and won a t-shirt, which was made for an infant, I swear, so I gave it to my anorexic aunt. I watched some random bands and looked at all my free stuff. Oh, and I bought the first Drive-Thru DVD from an English guy, who was really cute. TBS was amazing. Simply, amazing. The screamer was like, "Ohio is my favorite place to play ever!" He probably didn't mean it, but why would he even say it, who knows. Adam has definitely stepped up his microphone abilities. He was a magician throwing that thing all over the place. The way he wraps it around his neck, then snaps it off to sing, is brilliant. He was so cute. He thanked security and the people behind the scenes. Then he, being the poet he is, goes, "And you guys, if it weren't for you, none of us could be here. The fuck load of you make this possible!" It was something like that, oh it was perfect. Then those girls and I started to head out. But before we did, we saw Sean from Yellowcard! CRAZY, cause they are never around. He was wearing a pink polo and checked pants, like a little golfer. He signed my book and took pictures. Anna talks about how nice he is, but you couldn't really talk to him, since he was on the phone and a bunch of people were coming from every corner! I was trying to get my photo while this other girl was trying to get something signed and she goes, "You can do her first." Well, it made me laugh. After another trek back to the car, I got a call from Anna and she told me about Mae. Seems she had fun. Then I drove to my aunt Maureen's, where the whole family was. They bombarded me with questions, and I was like, "I'm too tired for this!" SO we went back to my aunt Sharon's and I had like five sandwiches, since I hadn't eaten all day. The next morning I went to my cousin Jenel's house and to visit my grandma. Then I drove home and babysat. I babysat this morning again, then went to see Chelsea's travel pictures, then went to lunch and to look at pictures with Ariel, and then came home and blogged. I'm very tired, I think I need a nap. Bye.
