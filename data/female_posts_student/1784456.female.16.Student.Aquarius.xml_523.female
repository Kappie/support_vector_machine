Geez, I was reading fanfiction, god some one that stuff is seriously depressing and powerful.  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=797824  Cure for depression, a seriously weird story, I'm talking about a on a par with Mr Fopple's weirdness story! Aargh, scary! Yeah... more freakiness in the world, that way the 2/3 of depressed people will be replace by 2/3 of totally freaked out mad people! Woooohoooo! Yeah, sounds like fun!
