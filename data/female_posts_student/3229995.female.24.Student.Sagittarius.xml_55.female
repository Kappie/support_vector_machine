It's been a while - probably 10 years, since I saw this film, but the thing I remember best, is the fact that the humans and the aliens couldn't understand each other, even though they were all speaking english. Hilarious :) Also, the same scene, were Bela Lugosi comes out of the forest, is used 5 or 6 times I think. And each time it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or with the scene directly preceding it. It sure makes you wonder if Ed Wood was on an acid trip or something? He just couldn't be fully conscious when making this film.
