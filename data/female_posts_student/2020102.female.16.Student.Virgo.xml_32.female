She was telling me about this mutual friend that she had a lot of problems with Freshmen and Sophomore year. Then recently, this friend came back and practically begged for Becca to take her back.   Becca said no. This girl had put her through too much and she was tired of being let down. I didn't know what to say. I just thought about how we used to be this great group of friends. Then freshmen year, everything went wrong. People went to drugs and alcohol. We kinda turned our backs on each other, and now there's barely even three of us left that are still trying to hang on to what was there before.  Then I was talking to my friend Matt. It was his birthday on Tuesday and he was making fun of me cause I forked the wrong house. But he still got the card cause he knew the people we did it to, and he thought it was great. And then he all of a sudden said he had to go. This girl, Gracie had called and they were all going to see a movie.   They being the people at my old youthgroup. I didn't really like my old youthgroup but I wanted to curl up and cry. My friends at school are all divided. My friends from the old church never talk to me anymore. And it kinda hurt.  Because I just realized. That I can't go back. I can't be the person I was and be the person I am today. It doesn't work. It won't ever be the same again. It might be better. But it won't be the same. And I can't go back.
