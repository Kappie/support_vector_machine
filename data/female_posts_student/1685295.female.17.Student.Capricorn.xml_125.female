I never realized how *sad* and *blank* this thing looks when I can't screw around with it. . . I mean, uh, look at how pretty it all it and not touch anything.  *pouts*  *twiddles thumbs*  And yes, English does suck.  Decidedly.  A lot.  But I don't have work anymore!!!  Saturday was my last day!  *squeals in joy*  Now if that damned kitten would let me get some *sleep* I wouldn't look like hell in school on Monday.  English. First and second period. The gods must be crazy.
