One would think such a question would be followed by statements about how disgusting and degrating such behavior is both to you and the person you're doing it to. But no--it was followed by resources for how to further engage in it. Revel in it. Enjoy it. Find others to degrade and dehumanize who are willing to be treated in such ways. This brought to my mind some bits of commentary I'd like to share.   "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." This commandment of the ten given to Moses on Mount Sinai has been taken (rightly or wrongly) by Christians through the years to mean don't lie. In Bible classes and among close friends people talk about the ramifications of lying: loss of trust, a breakdown in relationships, feelings of shame and guilt, separation from God, etc. Even in the "secular" world, truthfulness is upheld as of extreme importance (at least in personal relationships). The consequences of lying are well known and are to be avoided. Part of what happens when we lie to each other is dehumanization. We have decided that our pride is to be more highly regarded than the humanity and right-knowledge of the other person. That is wrong. Even popular movies frequently uphold this value.  To treat another person like a toy is another form of degradation and dehumanization, and yet THIS is perceived as more acceptable. One must only watch any "reality TV" show to prove this point. Girls compete for a guy's affection (or at least sexual attraction) in hopes that he's rich and she'll get to spend his money on herself. America sits glued to the television watching as these girls stab each other in the back and the guy strings them along through his position of power.   Should I be surprised that I would receive spam that advertises resources for treating people like objects? No, I suppose not. And yet it saddens me. How many people respond to these kinds of messages? How many people allow themselves to be treated like a toy because they are lonely and feel worthless? We murder each other through this kind of interaction. The true person is shoved below the surface so the body can be used or so our own selfish desires may be fulfilled without a thought beyond the self. So often it is the commandment against murder that is discussed as the worst rule to break. Yet we commit murder every day in more metaphorical ways, killing personalities to suit ourselves.   I would love to see the day when questions like the one that began the spam I received today would be answered with regret and a desire never to do it again. Such a day would see each of us being just a little more human.
