Really, this and  urlLink The O.C.  are the only non-reality shows I follow. Really. So anyway, I'm of the opinion that Dean totally came on to Rory, and he's the one who should feel the worst about it, not Rory. I mean, Dean showed up at her house and came into her room proclaiming his love for her, and how much he hated Lindsay. Poor Rory is all I have to say about it. And it irritates me when people say she's the slut... everyone always blames the woman. What about the man who toys with women's emotions to get laid? I ask you. These people. Check out the TWoP forums. The venom is amazing.
