I will not put myself in a position where I could possibly feel this way again. Sorry. It's how I am right now. Out of the 2 boys in my life that I cared ... really cared about.... guess how many fucked me up?... 2.. hah. Big surprise. So as of now, this 17 year old is done with boys until she starts university. I have no problem with little flings here and there, but I will not allow myself to become emotionally attatched to any member of the opposite sex in the near, and hopefully far future. I hate to feel like this. It's like a cloud, casting a shadow, and hovering over me, following me wherever I go, ensuring that this shadow never leaves me. I like him a lot. I can even go as far as to say I love him. Yet he doesnt care. He would never see me the way I see him. Never. He was one of the only people that I ever let in, I trusted him, I broke down the walls that were maintained for 2 years... he was the cause... he was the reason... and now he has given me the same reason to rebuild those walls and never break them down again. I hate this. I hate him. I hate them. All of them. All freaking TWO of them. I am not completely over the first one, another surprise, and I don't think I will ever completely get over this one. So the memory of these two will carry me through my life. That's enough for me. You know what hurts the most. The fact that I held back, my fear of being hurt. I have come to believe that me holding back was a factor, although it may not be a significant one (who knows).. which would lead me to this ... Trying to protect myself eventually lead me to being hurt.. Ain't life grand. I miss him..... Goodbye...
