Hmm...we went to the beach the first day...we thought we'd walk a couple miles out to this lighthouse. Yeah...we got there and we were soo tired and we had no water and it was hot and we didn't have shoes on either so the sand was tearing up our feet. We took a different way back which was this sand road and it was taking forever. Then these nice people came by and they picked us up and we came to figure out that we would have been walking for a looooong time in desert-like conditions. Thanks people! Next day, went to martha's vineyard, whatever that is. It was kinda gay. Yesterday we went to Boston and that was super amazing. I loved that city!! Oh yeah there was this cool City Toilet and you put a quarter in and u go in and do your stuff then once you come out it closes and cleans itself! Its sooo awesome! And Hillary went in and she said it plays relaxing music. Hahahaha! Ok so taht is my story. The ride home took all day and i'm gonna go sleepy in my own comfortable bed now! By the way, i only have like 20 days total left in york. So u better love me whilst you can!
