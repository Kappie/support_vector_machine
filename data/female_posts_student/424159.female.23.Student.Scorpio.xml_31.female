I know this is horrible, but the word itself is so damn funny it makes me laugh.  Here are some examples of how I see the word in context daily.  Malignant Neoplasm, Colon Malignant Neoplasm, Breast (female) Malignant Neoplasm, Prostate  How does this word make you fell?  Leave me a comment and let me know.
