So anyway right now I'm sitting here typing while listening to the melodies that the storm has to play out for us. The low rumble of thunder, the soft patter of the rain. Bliss isn't it? I like the rain. Okay! What makes more sense: "Oh look, thunder" or "Oh hear, thunder"? I think "Oh look, thunder" personally because it just rolls off the tongue.  Anyway me and Sondy are gonna rent a movie later. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen! Yea! Haha its gonna be fun fun fun! Ooh! Mean Girls was a good good movie! Tina Fey is awesome, and haha it was funny. Very Stereotypical but hah so good. Yeh, Its summer, the month of Chick Flicks have dawned upon us and now we must go make fun of stupid movies. Haha won't that be great? Anyway - going to go rent them / eat supper - what ever comes first... bye!
