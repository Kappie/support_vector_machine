Still can't get my point across that I don't want to spend every minute with him, since I've never had that problem before.  Anyway, I want details on what you all did.  I had a great time with my cousin Gael and her friend.  He was so funny.  His name was Joel, or Joe L., or something.  Sounds like Joe L. but I have no idea how he spells it.  They went to college together.  But I doubt that you all care about any of this, so I will close.  SO glad to be out of school.  ~Z
