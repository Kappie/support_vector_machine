And he's really hot.  My gosh...don't think I just like because of that.  He's been in my German class for the last two years and I didn't really notice him before.  He moved here from Japan before freshman year and learned English in about 8 months.  Pretty sweeet huh?  Haha, well He and I didn't become good friends until a few months ago, just before school ended.  He then asked me out but, being the uptight, prude-ish, can-never-be-too-careful girl that I am, said no.  That WHOLE day, all of his friends kept coming up to me and saying how "heartbroken" he was.  Of course I felt bad, but I hardly knew the guy...who could blame me?  I like to be careful with the guys I go out with.  I don't like having 1 week relationships and having them end with verbal fights throughout the whole next year.  I made the mistake of going out with the same guy for 11 months.  Before then, we were best friends.  But now?  HAH.  I'm not even gonna go there right now.....  So anyways, Alex [sorry if I forgot to mention his name earlier] and I have become really good friends during the past few months.  He invited to me to go to Japan with him for a week or two because he visits his family every summer.  My parents were going to let me because they thought it would be a great "cultural" experience.  But since I'm going to Alask in August, I had to renew my passport, which means that I won't get it until August 1st.  How gay is that haha.  But Alex and I have been talking so much.  It's weird...I haven't been able to talk to him [face to face] in over a month, but I like him even more than I did before I left.  I get butterflies everytime I think about him.  He's the sweetest guy I've ever met.  But a girl can't be too careful, right?  I hope so.....
