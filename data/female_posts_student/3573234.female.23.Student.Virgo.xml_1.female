I want to start this blog just to give out some personal opinons, share memories, etc, so bear with me if at times it's boring or what not heh :|  The reason why this is one of the worst day's ever, I hit a dog today, I don't want to go into the story...I was shaken up and freaked out by the fact that I hit an animal, I am a very sensetive person and I don't care to inflict any emotional or physical pain, bah anyways long story short, the dog is ok, not even a scratch on the dog!    Ok that is all for today thanks for viewing this hehe!
