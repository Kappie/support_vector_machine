I love what Hins Zhang wrote in his song "Sheng Yin"   釋放你的聲音 透露你的感(心)情 把屬於你的故事 唱給每一個人聽GO 我一直在聆聽 要用掌聲證明 現在你就是最耀眼的明星 別讓太多困難迷惑了你的眼睛 堅定的信念如影隨形  音樂不一定能讓誰變成明星 只要你用了心(用了心) 就有最真的感情 你要用你的心和聲音 打動每一個心靈 你要用你的心去聆聽 每個角落的聲音 你要用信心  勇敢去面對路的高低不平 雨遇就會天睛堅強努力前行 你要用你的心和聲音 打動每一個心靈 你要用你的心卻聆聽 每個角落的聲音 音樂的聲音 能化作天空最閃亮的流星 要你用心聆聽用真心感應   That the passion toward music...  i going to change my lifestyle of chasing idol totally...coz i dont want to waste any more time....  after getting my school time-table i going to plan my schedule for my music lesson...i have to work very hard for what i aiming now and then...i don't wish to be slacker any more coz i ord find my dream...  anyway even i sank very deep into music...dun worry of my study i going to study hard too...i will plan my time properly...  Anyway the last step of stepping into music was either to Lee Wei Song School of Music or The Music Clinic to learn Composing...
