Maybe it is the daddy's girl in me, but since my dad has missed so many holidays, they just don't seem the same anymore.  Although I tried to make it special for the kids.  I love watching their faces light up when they open their gifts.  I unfortunately was let go from my part time job at the Children's Place, the people there were awesome and I LOVED the customers too.  It was a pretty decent job, considering.  I miss it, oddly enough.  I guess things happen for a reason, who knows, maybe something will open up with them again.  Never believe a door is shut...life can surprise you like that.  Ah..and school...I only took 9 units.  I wanted to take it easy, we had that Make-A-Wish trip for Bailey.  So I knew I would miss a lot fo school...then there were the fires and the week the kids ALL got sick.  So i pretty much BEGGED my teachers not to drop me.  Thank goodness they didn't.  I got a B in my math (6 units) and an A in my English.  I LOVE ENGLISH!  I don't know why.  I do know that I want to teach English at the high school level, or teach at a Catholic school...the 8th grade, I am thinking.  I want to teach children that age to believe in their talents and somehow teach them how to love reading and writing as much as I do.  Writing is my passion...well after my Ed of course.  So only a few of you know this site...I figured it would be easier than having to mass e-mail or attempt to catch up with my e-mail.  I wanted you all to know what was going on with me...I am still the same insane person I have always been, maybe a little more with each child I bring into this world.  =P
