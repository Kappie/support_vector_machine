It was so easy buying things today. Man, what a relief. One day at a time, one day at a time.  I did get Tina a b-day present at last. She always buys me shit, so I figured since I had money to spend, why not spend it on her? I do have to get Joslyn a present still. Dammit. The t-shirt I want to get her is out of stock on oddshops.com. Maybe I'll find it somewhere else.  And Geoff is hitting on me again. YES!!!!!!!!  I'm out...
