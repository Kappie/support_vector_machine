We will put them on the site and see how they go, if people really don't like them we will have to take them off but we'll see how it goes. Thanks :)  My weekends plans are simply doing homework and recooperating from Thursday. London is really tiring. Today I did lots of art and watched Black Hawk Down. YES! JOSH HARTNETT IS IN A WAR FILM AND ACTUALLY LIVES FOR ONCE!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!! Yea, so that made me happy but now I am all very patriotic towards the USA. BHD is a true story film and they're motto type o thing: 'Leave no man behind'. Even if they guys were dead they defended them and kept the bodies safe until they could get them out of there. Now that, is honour.
