A big rig nearly slammed one of its 16 wheels into my head and a (race to be ommitted) driver nearly flung me a few lanes over as she randomly decided to merge.  Fun stuff.  I'm doing this swim clinic thing at Independence High (which is why I was putting my life on the line on 680) with a few Branham swimmers.  Kendra was trying to get my attention during one of the lectures by waving and winking and wispering at me (I was too entralled by the video of swimmers going back in forth in a pool that I didn't notice her) and this Mexican wannbe thug (dressed semi nice so he isn't a thug, semi-thug tho) thought she was hitting on him.  So, when she walked over, he looked her up and down and said, "Hello sexy."  She snapped her neck around and said, "I wasn't talking to you.  I wasn't looking at you."  It was so funny!  The guy was so embarrassed... he shut up, froze, and turned around trying to pretend it didn't happen.  Oh god that made my day yesterday.  Even better... is that this semithug that thinks he's hot shit can't swim faster than GINA!!! GINA!!!! THE MINIATURE M AT BRANHAM!!!  Plus, he's a cheerleader.  Hearing that made my day, too.  A cheerleading semithug.  Hehe.  Oh yeah, on top of that I was changing in the locker room and in the entire time that it took me to shower, strip, and put on real clothes, he had put 6 different lotions/sprays on.  Friggin insane.  A girly, primping, cheerleading semithug.  BTW --- Yesterday I had a near death experience(s) on the freeway.  Today I was wearing sandals coming out of the shower and started slipping in a puddle... kept slipping and dancing around (moon walk mostly, a little bit of the cha-cha kick sometimes, and a slight robot move with teh arms as they flayled) to keep my balance for about 5 (not kidding) seconds before grabbed a chain link fence to support myself.    I came back at 9;40 and Jason wouldn't answer his cell.  Where'd you guys all go tonight?
