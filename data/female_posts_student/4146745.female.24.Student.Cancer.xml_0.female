I am so glad that I am done, the store are at that time where they are getting busy with other back to school shoppers.      So today I got Daunte his new shoes, he picked out a pair of Sketchers (my fav brand of shoes of course). I got the school supplies for Mikayla and Jordan and then I was done. I still want some new shoes but I just have not found a pair of shoes that I like yet. I own so many pairs of Sketchers its crazy.      OK well not much more to write, I will be back some more soon :)
