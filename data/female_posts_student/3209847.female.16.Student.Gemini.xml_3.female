Today at school, the ring and pin ceremony was held. How fun is that?... yeah that's what I think! But it lasted a pretty long while and I got to see Sarah, so it was worth it. The juniors today were VERY excited about their new class rings, which they should be! Everyone was very excited. It was a good day. I had to perform my scene in Acting, which wasn't very good, but oh well. It's over now. After school, (BEST part of day), I got to go to Sarah's house until 7:30. She did calculus with Andrew for a long while. After he left, we ate pizza and watched VH1. It was the highlight of my month of April I think. I love her so much. I miss just being able to spend time with her.  Prom is coming up! I am so very excited! This might be my only year that I'm going, we'll see. I'll tell you about my dress...(like you want to hear I know) Its a black strapless dress, it has a slit on the left mid thigh, around the slit it has cool bright blue flowers and shit.. I think it'll be cool. It's easy to walk in at least. Sarah's is BEAUTIFUL. I haven't seen her in it yet though! grrrr...Its all red, with a pretty low back, the sleeves are different and the whole dress is kind of "flirty" and fun. Its formal but not starch and "promish" if you know what I mean... Anyway, prom should be a lot of fun.   As you may know, I've been in Casa Kids, a Casa Manana touring group, this entire year. Well Saturday is my LAST PERFORMANCE! It is going to be sad and happy at the same time. I really am going to miss the kids in the group. They are so very talented, i luv em. They're great. I'll miss my director too. She's fun.  Well that's all for now, maybe I'll post later!
