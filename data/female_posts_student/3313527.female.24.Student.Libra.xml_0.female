You have to be living fully in the now in order to be there to experience the healing. So for me, it feels like working with people's thinking caps is a way of helping them GET to that point,  GET to the present moment, stop lingering over old wounds or projecting about future dreams. Just.Get.Here.Now.    I think the mind has such HUGE power over the energy system- and thus the physical body- and the mind itself really needs to be healed in its own right, or else its going to keep afflicting the body and getting in the way of your energy work by just rethinking the same old thoughts, sparking the same destructive emotions, which will just keep remanifesting the same wounds over and over again. What's so exciting, though, is that just as profound of an influence it can have in the negative, so can you learn how to use it  positively as a tool to create a healthier energy system, to create a healthier physical system, to live a healthier life. We need to  start learning how to use our minds as tools, and take as seriously (if not more...) the necessity of staying mentally 'fit' as aerobically so .   Lucky for us, we can become aware of what the mind does, and teach it new strategies when the old ones aren't working.  What a Gift that one of the hugest influences on our health is something we are completely in control of, whether we always feel it or not !
