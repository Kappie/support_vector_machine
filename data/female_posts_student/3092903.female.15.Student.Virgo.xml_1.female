Really well acted and a great plot, but it kinda dragged in places, but I still really liked it..I got paid 60 bucks today for babysitting and it was damn well worth it. Today Emily crapped in the little potty training chair and I actually had to take the little pot or whatever and dump it in the toilet and then clean it out. She also wet her pants while I was putting them back on her from the 10 seconds before when she had just peed, so I got someone elses urine on me for the first time ever today. Nah, it wasnt really that bad, they're good kids. I have to babysit for the twins three day next week. That is going to be rough..I really hope she'll pay me for it, they are a huge handful. Tomorrow we have to do a roadblock for a fundraiser. That's probably something I am least willing to do. Almost like soliciting to people at the mall during one of those first fundraisers. I have no shame left after all the hell we've been through this year with raising this money, so what the hell? Stan and Linda are coming down with Jake for his birthday tomorrow, so I get to spend the afternoon with them and then my parents are going to some party and I guess I'll hang by myself or something. I miss Jamie and Darcie. They were here this time last summer. I remember they gave me $50 to save because they just knew that I would got to Scotland, and sure enough I am. THat was awesome that they were the first ones. I really want to go to Boston to see them, in fact, my mom was talking to Jamie about it last time they talked (Jamie's my uncle by the way, Darcie's his girlfriend. He had this awesome band named Love Jones that was really big up there, but they broke up this year..) I want to go up there just so I can  see  Emerson. I know I'm not going to go there, I just want to look at it just once so I can pretend..Damn the man who dealt me these cards in the poker game of life...No, college in Georgia will be..great.
