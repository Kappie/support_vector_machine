(down the slide) She just stands there and gives me the stupidest look and says "I'm not a boy".  Once again, I didn't look up to see who was next (you'd think I'd learn from these things, but apparently not) and I said "Okay sweetie, go ahead" (down the slide) and I look up and it's this old man looking at me.. he was pretty excited, I don't think anyone had flirted with him in a while. I also think he thought I was actually hitting on him, because when he came back up, he started hitting on me back, even though mine was a complete accident.  Why is there always no one to witness these things?
