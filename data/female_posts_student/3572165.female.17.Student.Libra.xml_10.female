The cons outweighed the pros, and much to my surprise (and relief) my dad was with me. I wasn't sure if he would be disappointed at my decision, but he said that actually he wasn't sure if it would be the best thing for me to play this year, but hadn't wanted to say anything to discourage me from trying. :-) so that is a tremendous weight off my mind, and i can safely say that i am content with my decision.  i finally finished  Crime and Punishment !!! and yes, i was very satisfied with it...but of course, i like Dostoevsky sooo :-P it is amazing to me how Raskalnikov could think for so long that there was nothing wrong in his murdering his landlady. He denied it all along, and yet the effects of it on his conscience - his illness, secluding himself from family/friends - were so clear! Well, I'm going to dive into  Anna Karenina  :-P
