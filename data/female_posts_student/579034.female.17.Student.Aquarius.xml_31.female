I had a GREAT time and I think everyone else did too... I was pissed off for a little while though cause Anthony Causi brought up a rumor that had been made about me, which is untrue, and it just really pissed me off.. but then I got back out there and all was good again... I had a really great time dancing around with my friends.. it was great... I can't wait till Danielle's party tomrrow night.. that is going to be great lol... maybe I'll bug my dad into giving me some money and dropping me off at that mall so I can buy a new shirt... I'm probably just gonna wear the same pants but a diff shirt... he's taking me school supply shopping tomorrow.. doesn't that just sound riveting!? OMG I JUST found out my stop mom got hit in the face with a fowl ball at the Yankee game tonight!! What are the odds!!! She's okay.. broken nose... stupid person who hit her... lets go beat um up... ::rallys angry mob:: ready? ::constipation cry:: LETS GO!!!!!!
