Today I slaved away at Subway *cough for 2 hrs* ahem, and then I went to my Grandmothers for some lunch and to change.  I then got to see Chad, for a little while anyway.  We met up and went to Best Buy (where he refused to renew his membership), the mall (where we bought absolutely nothing, but we did spend a little while in the  vibrating  chairs at Brookstone, lol) and lastly we went to Starbucks for a Frappacino, ummmm.    After I left Chads, I ran by my Grandmothers, again, this time to see Morgan.  She brightened up my day!  Then I headed home to change clothes so I could hang out with my girls, which was a blast.  We had a lil' app-ple-beeeess, a lil' starbuckarooonies, and a lil' auuugghhhh, loosaaa luuuucys.  lol.  We also had an adventure, in the  ghetto gas station .. whew... worn me out.  Anyway... I had a blast.. but I did miss Sarah! :(  I'm such a  matchmaker!!!   Ryan and Laura are on their way to hookin' up.. yea for me!  I'm sooo happy for them, its great.  I'm excited about tomorrow because they have planned another date!     You make me wanna la la.  In the kitchen on the floor I'll be your french maid. When I'll meet you at the door I'm like an alley cat. Drink the milk up I want more. You make me wannaYou make me wanna scream. You can meet me on an airplane. Or in the back of the bus.  You can throw me like a boom-a-rang. I'll come back and beat you up.     ~Okay thats sooo my line.
