I get a senior sweatshirt, I already have my ring,I'll have to start filling out college apps,and prom is in like 10 months (note to self: start looking for a dress!) While this is the most exciting thing EVER, if I think about it too long it makes me sad. Over the last three years at AHS, I've made some awsome friends and great memories. One of those is  Kevin . I was talking to my friend about prom and I started to say something about me and  Kevin , but then I remembered  he  hates me and never wants to talk to me again. Whenever I think about anything in the future, it always includes  him . I mean, we had kid names and everything. I've made mistakes before, but nothing like this. I hear people say younever know what you have until youlose it. Thatis so disgustingly cliche, but its so true.Well shit, im getting teary-eyed. I say that I've done things I regret but I wouldnt go back and change anything, but thats not true anymore. It was just so stupid. I fucked up and theres no excuse for it. I just hope  kevin  will eventually one day decide  he  does want to talk to me again becuase I love  him  so much.  He  is the most amazing, wonderful person I have ever met, and I don't deserve someone that great. Dude,,, this blows.
