I also have to confess that "Friends" is the reason everyone could not be entertained by my haikus at the writer's circle.  Maybe I could write a haiku about "Friends" and read it at the next writer's circle or open mic night!  That would be da bomb!  And Rap Mama Chelle is right.  Ross and Rachel do belong together.  He's her lobster.  I'm happy when Ross and Rachel are together.  The world is a better place when Ross and Rachel are together.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, so I'll just say that I'm a pretty happy girl in a pretty great world.  But it was sad to say good-bye.  I love you Chandler...and Monica...and Phoebe...and Joey...and Ross...and Rachel.  I love you Central Perk.  I love you Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.  Oh, wait, what am I thinking?  I have every season on DVD.  And then there's always syndication.  "Friends" will never really be gone!  Yay!  That makes me almost as happy as knowing that there are only 120 days until kickoff!  BOOMER SOONER!  I love you Bob Stoops...and Jason White...and Antonio Perkins...and Mark Clayton...and Dan Cody...
