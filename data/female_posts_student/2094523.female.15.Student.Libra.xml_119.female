I hate it when ppl obviously know ure in a damn conversation but chose to join in and just HAVE to be a part of everything even tho they know well that they are not liked. I hate people who think EVERYONE likes them when in reality EVERYONE HATES THEM. I want to smash them in the fuckign face. ITS NOT LIKE ITS MY FAULT URE A LONER AND I WANT IT TO STAY THAT WAY. Also when i tell u to "fuck off" PLEASE fuck off.  anyways thank u have a nice day please turn left and jump off the next cliff.
