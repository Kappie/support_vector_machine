WELL other news...my damn every 3 month friend is now every month. DAMN MOTHERFUCKER FUCKIN SHIT SHIT SHIT MOTHERFUCKER. i used to think i was fuckin lucky. but no, my body is just damn normal now. dammit. i guess i gotta be like every other 16 yr old now...DAMMIT. i liked being the girl with every sign of an "mature" body execpt for one thing..then i started to be a bleeding bitch like everyone else, but not as often, and now im just as often. DAMMIT!!! oh well..im sure everyone wanted to know that. hahahaha   I think i have "paranoia" when i drive or when i find myself in a car with someone and theres a lot of traffic and we're going over 45mph. lol that sounds so fucked up. but i find myself checkin the mirrors before my dad switches lanes, like hes not looking or something. and i saw this dude standin on the side of the road and he looked like a thug and i swear i had a mental thought "dude..what if he sudden pulled a gun out?" dammit..am i going INSANE?! i gotta stop that shit. hahaha
