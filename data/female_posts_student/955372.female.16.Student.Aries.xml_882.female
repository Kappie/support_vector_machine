By the time we were done I had to go and get my sister from school anyway so she drove me there and gave us a ride back. I thought both my parents were at work today, because ya know that's what they told me, so I didn't bother calling to tell them I was late. When we were driving to the house we passed my dad walking from his car to the school, I guess he got home early. So then when I get back he goes AND I QUOTE "Mom needs you to take the movies back to the library and drop these letters off." And he was acting all mad like I should have done this already WHEN I JUST WALKED IN THE DOOR. On top of that he couldn't just bring them down with them when he went to pick up Gio. Would that have been such a hardship? God forbid he thinks about someone else. And on top of THAT, I can't even walk right and he  knows it . My leg has been acting up since like Saturday and he expects me to walk 3/4 of a mile AND BACK. I told him all that and he goes "I think mom meant for you to do that." AND THEN in response to "you except me to walk 1.5 miles when I can't even really use my right leg" he says "Well  I  have to work" and he said it like I was just making up some lame excuse. I was just like wow so PHYSICALLY can't do it, but your excuse is you can't do it because you can't spare five fucking minutes from CHECKING YOUR GODDAMN E-MAIL YOU INSENSITIVE BASTARD. I hate that man sometimes. There is no way I am walking down. Oh or I do am in pain for like a day and a half and blame it on him. OH BETTER go don't come back for like three hours and say "well i just didn't think I could spend the next few hours with you" and throw that line back in his face from the time he gave my hockey ticket away. Again, sometimes I hate that man.
