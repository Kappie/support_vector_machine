So then as I am getting ready to go out Colman calls to says that the movie is sold out so maybe we'll just go grab a beer somewhere.  Okay, still can be simple and easy.  So I grab the T to Fenway and order a cosmo... Vodka used to be my devil drink but lately I have gone back to it with no problems... so that right there was the first mistake.  So three cosmos later and I am hammered... beyond hammered.  I don't know what happened.  I have never ever had the problems I had that night over three drinks especially three Cosmos.  I guess we ended up at a party after aparently I talked to Tyla on the phone.  I stayed at the party while the guys I came with left.  I don't remember the party, I don't remember the cab ride home and I don't remember getting into bed last night.  The few blurry moments I think might have happened (and I am not even sure about that) feel like a movie I watched and forgot.  It's insane.  It's almost like someone spiked my drink with something although I am about 99% sure that didn't happen.  Three drinks... had dinner before... someone explain why I cannot remember my night and why I have the biggest nastiest bruise I have ever had on the side of my arm.  Then of course there was the hangover all through work and I was opening.  The worst of it was it was the first time I was actually working with the store manager who just returned from leave.  AND... I had to lie and tell her I was getting a cold.  I went home and now I am in bed still nursing my hangover at 10:18 at night.... God help me....
