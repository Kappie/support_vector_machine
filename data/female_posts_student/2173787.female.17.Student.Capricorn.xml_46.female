Its times like that that i realize that we as a group are very sheltered. At lunch and after school there are 7 of us and its like the rest don't exist, except for the occasional hangers on.  Every once in a while i think i remember that they are there but its weird.  With that terribly strange thought i say good night....  Good Night
