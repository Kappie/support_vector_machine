Aimee Mann’s work   inspired screenwriter and director Paul Thomas Anderson to make the 90s classic ‘Magnolia’ (1999) starring Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. This was the peak of her fame, though she has a loyal following, she has never really broken into the charts in the same manor as her peers like Jewel and Sheryl Crow. This is a shame since she is one of the best recording sing/songwriters of today.     ‘BACHELOR NO. 2   or, the last remains of the dodo’ is a delightful and extraordinary album from the same year Mann recorded the soundtrack for ‘Magnolia’ and though similar in style, ‘Bachelor No. 2’ has far more intimacy and is working better as an album in whole. The album features 14 great tracks including four of the best tracks from ‘Magnolia’. Put it on, play it through, and find yourself mesmerised.
