Maybe it's because I don't wanna know.There's so many things that make everything so wrong. It's too hard to concentrate on them all. I wish I could just spill my heart out to some one, but I can't find anyone who would want to listen that hasn't hurd it all before. My life is one big block of cheese. It just sits there and let's the world take it's tole without fighting back. That is soooo not pimp. I need to loose weight and fast. I also need to run some for track before it actually starts. I have been lifting though, that way when I gotta throw, I have a arm. I don't know if I want to go to that ska concert now. I might, but I dunno. I havent been feeling the slightest bit of ska latley. That is definitly not pimp. Bah Humbug. If anyone would like to come and save me one of these days, I'd be more than happy to be saved. Ima go before I get you sad. Don't feel bad. No one does anywho.
