And this "confliction," is really messing me up. Why do people think I have no feelings?  I am one of the most emotional people I know, and I know that for sure, yet so many mistake me for someone else. I'm uptight. I'm scared of my life and the people in it. I am easily hurt by the actions of others. I am caring to all others, and I expect that of everyone I know. But I don't get it more often than not, and that hurts.     I lost my Edgewood match but played extremely well, and put up a good fight. Today was a match vs. Mentor, and I beat the girl, 4-6, 6-0, 6-2. It was bad, I played bad. I need to figure how to play *my* game, and not play good against the good people, and bad against the bad people. It's weird.  "Meet the Teams," is tomorrow night. It's going to be fun, well at least I hope. Aaron's not going to be there, and that's not too good. He is the one person in my squad that know's what he is doing. He and I are cool now. I know in the spring it was touch and go there for a while because he practically left me in the dust for Danielle. ( And what a wise move that was, too.) I have a lot of fun at band these days, and that's good. Because I haven't had too much fun lately other than that.
