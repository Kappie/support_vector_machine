Arik left today for something so I can't talk to him till Sunday...or tomorrow night...I dunno...depends on when/if I go to the dance...but today...I got up around 1...got online did basicly did nothing all day...round 5 I went over to Jons and we sat around till 6 and went uptown...decided there was nothing fun so we went out to Godfathers and had some pizza. Had a great time talking bout stuff...random stuff...and then my favorite person in the world came...Jeff. Dun...dun...dun...eh. He came over and was like "Jon...this your new lady?" Hes like "No." Eh...I hate Jeff...err...If I never woulda started it off bad with him way back when...he wouldnt have a problem with me...but whatever. So after that we came to my house so I could grab a sweatshirt...Ariks ofcourse...and he laughed at my big fat duck. It was soo funny. LoL The Wazzzup Duck...haha.  Then we walked back uptown and got rained on. We decided nothing to fun was going on so we walked back to his house and we sat around in his room somemore...talked bout stupid things...like these drawings he did..they were pretty cool tho. I laughed. He also gave me my b-day present which was a hello kitty pen. Its awesome! lol...fun stuff. Then we walked back to my house and then out to the fireworks...watched them...and both stated we wished Kait and Arik were there with us. The finally was pretty good actually. I think its the first time Hartley has actually had fireworks in a long time. It was amusing...then we walked back here and attempted to figure out how we were gonna meet tomorrow for the parade...and then he walked home. So I came in and decided I wanted a new blog...since I deleted the old one...and no one is on to talk to ...and my parents are uptown probably getting drunk...so Im home alone...I knew this was gonna happen....me alone this weekend. *sigh* If only Arik coulda come...I remember months ago I was looking forward to this weekend....HA....I actually thought it was gonna be fun....whatever. Im havin fun with Jon tho...so its all good. Only a week till I see Arik...*hopes* Jon and I talked bout it tonight...he might be able to go...but who knows...I want to go sooo badly! We'll see I guess....But I got this really sexy fun shirt yesterday shopping with Tracy and I wanna wear it...but he also asked me to the homecomming dance at his school this year...and if I can go to that...I'd wear that shirt...cuz its soo fun! Thanks Tracy for talking me into buying it. Its great fun. So yeah...I guess I have nothing else to say....later kids....  -Tara
