Brian and I are looking forward to watching  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . It looks kind of silly, but we've seen all of Kevin Smith's movies so we might as well see this one, too.    GREET ME !  GREET ME !     August 10th marked mine and Brian's second anniversary. We celebrated yesterday, the 11th.. He was all secretive about what he had planned for us for the whole day. Our first activity was one-hour, full-body massages for the two of us at Sveta's. After that we went on a picnic at Sedgwick County Park. We then went to see a movie of my choice (because Brian said it was my day and I got to decide everything)..  Legally Blonde . It's a really cute movie. We went home, took a shower, got cleaned up.. Dinner was at 9:00 PM and then we went dancing at America's Pub after that. Brian, who usually hates dancing, danced with me all night. I was so happy !  He really made my day !
