Anway, we got our Science paper results today and eversince then, she was diffrent. She had a C while I on the other hand got an A. But, when I started a conversation of how cute the guys in Smash!! are, she was like whatever. Then. after school, we use to learn taekwondo in OUR school but now in a diffrent school. So, our friend Evelyn who happens to be a coach at taekwondo...we were helping by puttingthe sparring vest (lets just say protection from people killing eachother) and Melissa was all like 'SHUT UP SHIV! I DONT WANNA TALK ABOUT ANYONE NOW' and I was shocked. I told her she has become diffrent and in my shcool, it is a BAD thing. You can get in trouble with the vice principal...OR EVEN BETTER THE PRINCIPAL HERSELF! So, I dont want to get in trouble AGAIN. If you ask anyone in my school that if what if Melissa's fav topic, well you would get this answer 'WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?And yeah, her fav topic is BOYS!'. So...I might not have givin you people enough details about the problem here but to me...theres something wrong with Melissa and it is NOT her Science marks.
