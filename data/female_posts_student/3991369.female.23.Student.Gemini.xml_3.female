I dreamed about you last night.you knew me.you even smiled.but it was such a short dream that i could't...well,i don't know,maybe hold you? I am finding a job tomorrow,and i am also going swimming,and i will also have an icecream,and buy a few new books that i had in mind for sometime now,you know books are my favorite,and i will also do a lot with this computer,i am improving you know...i am going to teach when i finished this course of 3d max and all that stuff.and i am doing a lot more tomorrow,so i won't think about you during the day,i would be so busy,so happy,so successful. but what am i going to do about the night? oh the nights. they are miserable. even if i force myself to sleep,think about that handsome boy called Ali,.... you would come to my dream,with your perfect smile,i would fall in love with you again. and my story with you never ends.
