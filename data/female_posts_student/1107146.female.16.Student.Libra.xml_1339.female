Good job on the barking.  ;) I promise to call you tomorrow, Linds.  What's with the "Germs, my invisible dog" thing?  Just curious.  I have a random quote that Lindsey should know.  "I wonder why people hate public transit."  ;)  'Member that one?  Boy howdy, is Vegas coming up quickly. *rubbing it in for Lil' China's sake*  Clothes packed today.  Grrr...more stuff to come.  Daddy Dearest just can't wait, apparently.  Good thing is that I finally get to wear this dress (whole group of people reading this gasp simultaneously...yes, a dress) that's been in my closet for eons.  It's REALLY cool, for the girls who care and even for the guys who don't.  Anyway, getting late...or something, so I'd better go.  Talk to you guys later.  ~Z
