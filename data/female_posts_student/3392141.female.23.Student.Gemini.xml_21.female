I didn't see  5 red cars    in a row, I just got a bit caught up in that book I'm reading called 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time'. You'll know this one Wayne!    Anyways, Andrew took me  OUT TO THE BALLGAME TODAY ! I was so excited... We went to the MCG to watch the    MIGHTY     MIGHTY   HAWKS    play against the little  ittybittytitty Kangaroos !! No prizes for guessing who we were rooting for.  *grin*  Despite the drizzle, we were wayyy too excited and nothing... and I mean nothing could dampen our spirits! Except our team losing... and sadly,  H  a  w  t  h  o  r  n  did dampen our spirits today.     SEE:    urlLink  http://afl.com.au/default.asp?pg=news=displayarticleid=162097    The bloody Kangaroos won 143 to 63... What a disgrace! But what the heck! I had fun and so did my baby... My first ever footy game. I'll never forget today...   I'm so tired right now... I'm gonna take a shower, curl up on the couch with my baby and watch a good movie! Remember the Titans is on tonight! Another footy-themed inspirational movie... *sigh*  ***** 5 kissies for my fav footy team!  * x 1 million . A million kissies for my favourite footy fan! Thank you once again for bringing me to the game!
