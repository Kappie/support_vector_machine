Today I not only am starting to work on articles for my professor but I have to start a thesis for one of my classes! Stupid economists want to get the most for their money (maximize utility through output subject to a budget constraint) I do wish someone would clarify on Hokie House. I was devistated when I read Tiff's message!   So I think I am going to win Brendan's Super Bowl Pool... I just have to because I didn't get crap last year (except the enjoyment of watching it with all of you) But I need more! I will be watching the big game with the dog and cat and turtle that I am pet sitting for the week. It should be a blast!  Oh I was going to tell you about the ballet. It was Cinderella performed by The Moscow Festival Ballet. They were pretty good but I kept thinking "I bet Michelle could do this." It was an interesting take on the story and the step-mother was played by a man which gave it a little twist. I now feel I have had enough culture to last awhile so I won't be going back soon.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');
