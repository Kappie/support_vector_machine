Then, after marching band outside, I got a rash inbetween my legs and it hurt throughout the day like shit! I wanted to kill myself it was so bad. I couldn't even sit! But I got through it ok. I was falling asleep in each class from my lack of sleep...Then to make matters worse, Danyah hung around me after school hile waiting for the Alex bus. I'm suprissed i'm still here...Anyways, my brother and my dad came home from my dads buesness trip in Tuson. Yay. But i guess i'll stop yapping my mouth and stop typing. Next post i'll type some of the poems I wrote. ^^ Oh yeah Alina, we still have to tell Emily about the "thing". Toodles all.
