AAHHH!!!  Okay so I am on here because it is gosh dang hot up here I decided to give the AC a break because I don't want it to hurt our wallets in the end, but damn when it gets hot here, it gets hot here and let me tell yah, my frickin' migraine comes with avengence.  can you tell the heat is getting to me?  So we went to the Gap and bought some things.  I bought a couple of shirts because the 4 shirts that I have been routinely rotated are getting worn out and with good reason, I seem to only buy clothes when they are no longer appropriate to wear due to stains or holes. (Well out in public anyway) or if I outgrow them.  So life is good.  I need to do some yard work that I am putting off because it is too dang hot when I wake up.  Yeah, I know I am lazy.  I have to enjoy the little sleep in time I have left.  You know.  So you guys have a pleasant night.  I am going to jump into the shower and stay under the cold water for a good hour or two, until I am frozen...I figure it will take about 10 minutes flat to defrost me in my room...It is that hot.
