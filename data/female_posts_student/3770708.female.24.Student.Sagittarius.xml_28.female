Mike slept in after a long night at work while my mother and I went to buy ingredients for his cake. First, though, we had to stop at the chiropractor, whereupon my mother spent an hour bargaining over the cost of her treatment and ultimately sold me to her doctor in payment. Yes, she emerged with a sheepish grin and said "I knew you wouldn't begrudge your mother a healthy back..." And so it was that I became obliged to illustrate a book by April in exchange for $2000 worth of chiropractic work for my dear mother. It took me by surprise, but I really don't mind the opportunity to submit another book for publishing. Clever mother.  By noon, we were home with cake goodies, and Gavin was out for a nap. Encouraged by his inactivity and my mother's sudden preoccupation, Mike and I ran upstairs and spent some rare time together (wink wink, nudge nudge). Alas, gone are our wild college days, for when confronted with the opportunity to take a shower together for the first time in three years, Mike and I decided that we'd rather not be crammed in together, taking turns under the water, and elbowing each other in the face while shampooing. Ah, adulthood.  Filet mignon for dinner, followed by the glorious truffle cake and presents. Mike tore open his presents, pleasantly enthused about his new MP3 player, fiddling happily with his new pedometer, and running his hands over his ornate journal. He seemed a little put off by the one gift he actually requested; a small bottle of tequila with the notorious agave worm in the bottom. According to my online buddies, he's got to chew it, and hope he won't suffer days of debilitating diarrhea thereafter. Happy birthday, Mike!
