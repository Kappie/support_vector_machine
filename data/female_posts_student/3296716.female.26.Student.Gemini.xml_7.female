And, I almost recalled a book that I looked up because it was checked out. But then I realized that I was the one who had checked it out. :)  I also printed out an application from cy-fair isd to fill out. And I am going to go out to KISD tomorrow because I haven't been able to talk to anyone about my application and I don't want it to fall through the cracks.
