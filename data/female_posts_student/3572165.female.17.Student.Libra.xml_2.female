We were going to go to the Robertson's for MET, which would have been lots of fun, but Angie Robertson wasn't feeling very well,so it was cancelled. During dinner, Tricia and Ryan came to get us to practice some psalms. Andrew wants the mission team and us to sing some psalms for the congregation after evening service, b/c the psalter is different here. they are trying to move to ours, but they don't know them well at all so we are going to help them learn them :-). of course, we are singing 98A.  Their   psalter is a split-leaf (i think that's what it's called) with the music at the top, and then words on the bottom. actually, most of the psalters don't even have the music, so we have been winging it pretty much, trying to pick up the tune after the first verse.  today the Quigley's are moving. The mission team + people from the church are helping move, while Alicia, Bekah, Christie and Corinne watch the 3 youngest Quigley's, Calvin, Catherine and Caitlin. I am being sent to paint in the new house!! :-) it should be fun, at first it sounded like i would be the only one painting, but Jason (team leader) said that some of them would probably help.  tonight the mission team is having an ice cream social/bas ball game for the youth, that should be a lot of fun. well, i should go get to work now :-) oh, i'm terribly sorry, but the computer i'm on at the library won't let me onto my blog, it will only let me post stuff. soo that means i haven't been able to read any of your comments!! *sniff* lol you see, i'm assuming that some of you will have commmented. :-P well, i'll have lots to read when i get home, right?!!
