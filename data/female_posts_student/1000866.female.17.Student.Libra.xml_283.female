I have totally cleaned my bathroom. Scrubbed the tub, washed the counter, cleaned the toilet! Man...seriously, I loathe cleaning but it's not so bad once you're done haha. Actually, I'm not quite done. I still have to wash my floor and the bathroom floor. That's the problem with wood flooring in one's room. It has to be washed AND swpet, not just vacuumed. Hmmm, what else has been going on? Not too much. I have prospects that I'll ACTUALLY get to get my new furniture soon. I realllly really hope. I'm excited. I saw this really nice duvet set from target actually. I don't usually shop at Target, but eh. I'm thinking about getting it. Going out with Ryan didn't work out. I didn't see any sense in him driving all the way here when we would only get to spend maybe two hours together. It takes him half that long to get there and back. So, why bother? He said he would, but...eh I didn't feel much like actually getting dressed. It's funny, I take a shower in the morning, and then if I don't think I'm going to go out, I just out a new pair of pajamas back on. I LOVE pajamas. :) They're so comfy. I think I may need to go take another shower though. I smell like....amonia from all the cleaning stuff. Mixture of fantastik, some bathtub scrub stuff, and toilet bowl cleaner. Blah! I'm in a pretty cheery mood right now though, even though I haven't been doing anything really fun today or anything. I'm kind of bummed since I can't go downtown with Katharine and her friend Kristie tomorrow, but I know I'll have another opportunity. They'll go some other time. Oh, and Kelly's coming home Sunday!!! She didn't get to go to California though. I wonder why...  Ah well, a mystery of life that I shall probably find out Sunday when she gets home! :) I'm outta here to go wash my room floor, my bathroom floor, and my brother's room floor, aren't I nice? And then a shower. I might write later tonight, but I'm not really planning on coming online.
