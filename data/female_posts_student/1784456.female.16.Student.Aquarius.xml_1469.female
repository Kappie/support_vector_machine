Izzy took me along for some strange reason, and we kind of ignored Petes strange little friend, who is strange by the way.  We went to Tesco 3 times, and saw mrs Smith, and Petes Lemonade bottle fizzed everywhere so Izzy and I ran.  Its SOOO COOL there is now a zippy wire at the sotch horn park wotsit, its sooooooooooo fun.  I nearly pulled Izzy off it though.  So she chased me and i ran.  Then we came to my house had an ice lolly and she went home.  Which was good, and I have been online ever since!  HEHE. Ricotta Cheese sounds absolutly minging, I can tell u that I will not be trying it.  U can!!! Then tell me how bad it is. xx
