And a plastic flamingo named pinky. but we'll ge to that later.        2) went to rehearsal. man, rehearsal was grrrreat! it was fun seeing everyone. and after rehearsal was fun too. hanging out is usually fun. and as usual, geoff, barrett and i played groundies. it's way exciting with them folk. never gets old.        3) came home. but really, it includes more than coming home. we drove by packman's house. packman is at perry mansfield. and his house got flamingoed. you know...hundreds of pink flamingos all over the front yard. so i took one, which barrett named pinky. if you happen to be bored and have a car, or are in the area, defo drive by packman's house.it's a beautiful, beautiful sight.        4) wrote this blog entry. exciting, isn't it? yup.
