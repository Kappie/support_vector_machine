So yeah..I'll run through my day now...In Spanish today I was supposed to take a quiz cuz I was sick when everyone else took it...but she lost it so she said forget it. Yay! lol Then we watched Finding Nemo...oh for fun~! Yeah. And we had tons of food. Paige brought her brownies...Jenny brought breakfast pizza...Jenna brought bagels and this yummy cream. It was just so fattening! Very yummy tho. So yeah. Science was just dumb...Took our tests...I probably failed but I don't really care anymore. So yeah. Nothin really happened at lunch or in homeroom..Algebra probably failed that test too. It was alright until the last page graphing all the crap. I always get confused on that part so yeah. Then in choir Tracy painted my nails and now they are all pretty...I have flowers on my thumbs..then these fun lines and dots then cherries and on my ring finger I have yellow and blue stripes(afterwards I realized that that is Humboldt colors lol) and then I have hearts on my pinkys. Fun stuff. Yeah. Band was boring...we just sat around gettin stuff ready for marching band. Ugh. What a drag. I really hope we dont have YC on the 2 or the 9th of October...Or I'll be pissed once again. So yeah...Then we had a cheerleading meeting...*sigh* We do have a JV squad now...*sigh* Tho I guess I'll be Varsity the next two years...If I stick to it. I dunno. *shrug* Depends on what happens...Yeah. So yeah...I guess thats all that happened today........  Tara   Current Song:  none.  Current Mood:  content.
