I have twenty-six more days before I leave; for the last three or four years, I've been hanging on...every time I got frustrated or hurt by something one of my parents said or did, I'd tell myself, "Only a few more years, dear, just hold on for another two years." And now...I'm telling myself, "One more month, dear, just one more month before you move out." But all the money required...it's an insane amount, and I feel like my life revolves around nothing else. Everything that I need....I never thought that I could be in need of somany trivial things. I was under the impression that I would have just accumulated these things, the way that I had for high school. My head is going to explode. Axyl
