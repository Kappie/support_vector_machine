I lay crying on my bed, I know remember the words you said, Can it be true are you really dead?  The ashes of it all resettle on the ground, Sacred beads picked up and put away, Now can you be found, 'Cause I really want to stay.  I lay crying on my bed, I know remember the words you said, Can it be true are you really dead?  I start to look around, What I've been trying to say, I miss you and I would fall to the ground, For just one more day.   Jessica Renee Cole    So tell me do you guys like it??
