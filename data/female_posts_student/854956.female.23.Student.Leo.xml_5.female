They've flown by, so I'm sure the rest of the semester will be no different.  The past few days I've done a lot of thinking about a lot of stuff.  After a month of not talking to me because of a big argument and such, "Cam" and I have been talking.  We talked everyday, Mon-Thurs.  The first day was the most horrible, because we rehashed everything that happened, I got bitched at and such... it was just... depressing.  However, I think there's great potential that he and I can remain friends (which is all I want after careful evaluation of our previous attempts at serious relationships)... we've been able to chat casually the past few days... and there was even points where we admitted things we missed about hanging out with each other.  Anyway, everything seems to be okay in that respect of my life.  Classes are demanding (and will only get MORE demanding from this point on) but I am interested in all of them.  Even World Civilization.  Masterpieces of Music is my favorite class thus far, next in line is Psychology, and then Biology 2 and World Civ.  Psychology has been really interesting and fun.  The professor adds enough humor to make it interesting, but not so much that it sets me in a "slacker" mode for the class.  We have our first exam next Friday... and I'm actually looking forward to it.  haha  I have a take home quiz assignment due in Masterpieces next Tuesday.  We're supposed to watch a movie (any movie) and evaluate the mood the music sets in certain parts, and why they used that music and such... what tones it sets... ya know...?  Any suggestions may be left in my comment box for this post  :-)  Anyway, so for those of you that I told about my Grandma's house (which flooded because of a toilet that cracked open) the repairs are pretty much done.  They fixed the floor throughout the house, and they replaced the cabinets and such in the kitchen and elsewhere... so, we're all going over tomorrow so my Dad can evaluate the work before my Grandma signs all the insurance paperwork.  I don't think we'll be there TOO long, though... because she still has no toilets and stuff.  Or actually, we'll have to go to my cousin Wanda's to use the bathroom.  I'm excited to see all the work (because they've been working on her house for like, a month)  Anyhow... like I said earlier, feel free to leave suggestions for a movie I can watch for Masterpieces, but keep it under an "R" rating... no, X-rated stuff... ;-)  hehe  Sorry, Mel... no Ron Jeremy!  hehe  LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink ">Comment
