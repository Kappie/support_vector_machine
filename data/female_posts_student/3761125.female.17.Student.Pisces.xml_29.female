Apparently the American version comes out here on the 17th but it has a different cover and that pisses me off. Since the band's British, I just want to order it from England... I'm just picky that way sometimes. Can I just say how awesome they are though? Jesus Christ. I can't stop listening to    "Golden Touch"    and that's a problem because I don't want to get sick of it. I think I'll stop listening until the album gets here. Yes. *nods*  Ha.  Like I'll follow through with that.  Well, we just ordered pizza so that should be here soon, and then I'm off to the gym. Nothing else to report except that I've realized a few things about my personality that I need to fix, thanks to you (and you know who you are). I feel good knowing that you can help me become a better person.  This is fucking cool:    Later.
