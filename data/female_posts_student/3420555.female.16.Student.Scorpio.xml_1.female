Of course this sheep-like-following of crazy fads isn't something I do all the time. In fact the last time it happened was when I was in 6th Grade, and that was with Pokemon Cards (what are pokemon you say? Don't worry you are probably best not remembering) but then again before that was the hopscotch faze, the marbles, the yoyos oh and lets not forget those wonderful novels, Goosebumps. *sigh* Now once again I have been drawn into a crazy faze, but not because "all the cool kids at school are doing it" but because I just don't know anything about Blogs, and I don't like being left out of the loop. I know curiosity kills the cat but finding out the answer brings it back, right? Or at least something along those lines. So if what I have been rambling on about is not what I am suppose to be rambling on about then please someone point it out and tell me what I am suppose to be rambling about... because I have zilch of an idea. Ok thats sorted. I guess I should start of this momentus (wrong spelling? Meh) occasion by talking about myself. Ok! My name is Cate. I am a typical 16 year old. Pessemistic, confused and altogether pretty funny and weird in the eyes of others. I live in Sydney, Australia and that's about all that I have to tell at the moment... Wow don't I live an exciting life...
