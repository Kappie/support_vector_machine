He was writing derogatory things about members of the same sex and what he'd like to do with them, but we'll assume we won't have that problem here. I really miss this, I miss just being open about things. I'm kind of sad or depressed or one of those really uncomfortable feelings you just can't put your finger on. Actually I think I'm just kind of disappointed in myself at the fact that my summer isn't going as planned. I'm still hanging out with the same people all the time instead of trying to get to know  everyone  better like I originally planned. And its not even that, its that I give off the little Erin facade of being flirty and ditzy all the time. Facade isn't the right word, I guess I just keep using that side of myself because its the easiest to show. Its either the two extremes, the bitch or the flirt. I guess that's not all my fault anyway because noone really cares enough to get to know me to crack into that. No one has been talking about anyone yet, that's a good thing. After the whole audition thing when I heard that Kim and Rachel were saying stuff behind my back, I got really worried but everything's been awesome so far. Kim and Rachel were telling me how bad of a flirt I was the other night and that worries me, because I don't want to come off that way all the time. Like that one time Lacy was trying to make me feel bad and told me Mr. Davis said that I was smarter than I let on. Man, I'm sounding all different shades of retarded right now. I just read what I wrote and I sound like I've overdosed on Prozac. I guess its one of those lonely things, like I really want to sit down and have a conversation but there's no one to talk to except my parents. You know how statistics show that suicide rates increase during Christmas holidays due to loneliness? The older I've goten the more that rings true, because summers are a bitch for me, because I never see anyone. Except for this one, this Scotland trip is going to rock. I may have to start working at Dekalb next week because I need money to buy clothes bad. I hate having lost all that weight, but having no clothes to show for it. I still need to lose a good 30 or 40 pounds. I started back dieting Monday after I went a little crazy last week, but Sara convinced me to eat when she came over last night cause we all know how Sara is about food, right? Well, I'm going to try to find something amusing to do...Oh my crap. They are watching a Giovanni Ribisi movie without me, gotta go, gotta go.
