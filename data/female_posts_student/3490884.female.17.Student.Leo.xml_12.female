Good times, bad times, sad times. The day was a mixture of all three.   At least now I have some closure. I also have more faith in some of my friends. Now, I know what a chicken salad sandwich tastes like. And I have some big ideas and projects in mind for the coming weeks.   Oh when the wheels in my head start spinning, it's time to watch out. That's what my mother said to me once. Haha. I think it's true. When I set my mind to something, it is definitely time to watch out because something big is in the works. So basically, something big's on the way. Keep your eyes open.   The idea of keeping your eyes open brings to mind a few other things, but I'm not gonna go into them all. That's too much. Basically, carpe diem-seize the day-is a major one of those themes. Another one's related to that theme and centers around missed opportunity. Basically, saying what you want to say while you still can--letting someone know how much you care about him or her now, not later--those are the major components. But of course, going into everything I'm thinking connected to that would turn into an unbelievably long and personal blog. Too much so for now. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.   So in keeping with doing favors to spare myself and others, I'm gonna end this right here and not go into all the things that have been on my mind lately. I leave you with two ideas: old habits die hard and once you get something or someone into your thoughts, that thing or person seems to stay there.
