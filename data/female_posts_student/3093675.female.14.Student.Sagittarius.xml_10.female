You’re not in Iraq doing the fighting, you’re not facing people who behead people as a part of their culture and who would gladly blow your head off. You’re not the one they’re bringing it on to. The people in Iraq right now, fighting for your reputation, for your oil are the ones that they will “bring it on” to. And you say BRING IT ON?  Yeah right. They won’t be bringing it on to you, but we will. Oh, you better believe it, we will, Mr. Bush. Because we know. We know you don’t give a flying fuck about Iraqi blood, we know you don’t care about the troops, because if you did, you’d get them the fuck out of there, and we know you use the “terrorist threat” and 9/11 as a screen to keep people from seeing how you’re ass-fucking the American public, and believe me, we won’t be forgiving you for it, and we certainly won’t be forgetting. So when you say bring it on, you’re not only talking to them. You’re talking to us.
