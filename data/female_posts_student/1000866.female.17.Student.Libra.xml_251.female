This is what makes me want to get as far away from high school as possible. There are times I really love high school, and then times like now when it dissapoints me so so much. Not, it, but the people dissapoint me. People need to grow up, and realize what they do has consequences, and eventually, what goes around, comes around. I hope. It better. I don't care about how people aren't supposed to want revenge. I do. AHHHHH!!! Why are people like that?? Why can't people be decent to other people?? What the HECK?? I'm sick of this. So sick of it, and I can't believe their friends with him too. They probably think he's really funny. GAH! I'm glad Alex told me. I'll know never to even come close to associating with him. Forget this.
