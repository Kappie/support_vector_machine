He is supposed to call, but I am just all of a sudden really wanting to cry and see him and wow... I just got emo again, so that is what the is........ it was a long day, what can i say... Russell and 'Lissa were fighting all day, she and I left him at Arundel Mills, picked up Brian, met up with Russell at Marley and then came home... okay, it was a lot more than that, but ya know... BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!  I just kinda wanna cry... I am stressed right now.... tooo many problems to figure out.... ahhhhhhh, ::sniffle sniffle::  oh well, that is all for tonight... peace
