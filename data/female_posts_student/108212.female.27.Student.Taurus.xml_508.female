Thankfully, this boo-boo was fixable. The blogger tags just got deleted was all.  I just needed to put it back and configure the formatting.  Feel free to play with the code, just be careful not to erase the blogger tags.  They might look like jibberish, but they're there for a reason!  And if you are worried that something might have gotten typed over and can't remember how to fix it, always hit cancel!  (Just some words of wisdom from someone who has been there, done that and messed all sorts of other things up.. It's the best way to learn HTML, though, that's for sure!)
