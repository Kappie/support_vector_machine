My dad was kind enough to volunteer our house for my cousins' birthday party and well let's just say this...they are a terror and I am not even in the mood to clean because I know that it would be pointless because those darn kids are going to wreck the house in under an hour flat.  I am so serious.  I LOVE KIDS but I think that being around them for as long as I have with no real vacation or down time...I think I am going insane and the sad part is, I want to be a teacher.  LOL  No but really.  I am the most responsible parent there is...well one of the most, I have my faults...but I think I am more responsible than other moms out there.  My children are my life and you can ask anyone who knows me.  I think that is why my life has been so stressful.  I don't take the time out for me.  I think that maybe that is what I need...a mini break...not to mention a mini break from my family.  LOL  (Except for Ed...I want to spend as much time as I can with him.)  Unfortunately Iraq ia so many miles away and unlike Inman (Cold Mountain), he cannot walk back home to me.  LOL  But after watching that movie, I can't help but think how strong love can be, even though it is a "hollywood" version of romance...it touched me...I will admit it.  Sad note...Ed had to get rid of Sparky the snake...We still have Stitch...however annoying he can be at times...
