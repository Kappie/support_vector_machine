Here are the reasons why:  1) I treated myself to a Sausage, Egg, and Cheese McGriddle and a Diet Coke for Breakfast. 2) I showed up an hour late for work and got paid for it! 3) I spent an hour before lunch chatting with a co-worker 4) Spent the whole time afterlunch until I went home watching "I Love the 90s" and "On-Air with Ryan Seacrest" and got paid for it! 5) I get to sleep in as long as I want to tomorrow....and Sunday. 6) I got both Us Weekly and Instyle in the mail today! 7) I got my haircut, and fixed my bangs which I had cut with a pair of kitchen shears in a fit of insanity.
