Now he met and got along with Toni last weekend but they were both plastered out of their minds therefore I had no idea if it would work when we were all sober.  So I picked up Bret, picked up Toni and then we went to get Ryan and thus far all is good.  Then we get to Clarendon Ballroom and there is a line down the block (small block - but still a block) and when we finally get to the door the bouncer teases Bret about being newly 21.  Awww... I love that kid so I felt kind of bad but I don;t think it phased him much.  Anyway, so then we're told that it's gonna take 30 min to even get up on the roof bar so we're kind of bummed out, but we decide to go try anyway.  We get up right away, might have had a little help from Toni showing some cleavage.  So we get up, start drinking and Bret is cracking jokes left and right, we're cracking up.  I think he may now know more about Toni and I then he ever wanted to because when we get drunk we talk about personal things WAAAAYYYY too much!  Anyway, so the female bartender was flirty with me :) and made Toni EXTREMELY jealous :)... sorry Toni but the truth hurts.  Ryan seemed to be having a good time too.  So eventually Toni and Ryan go to find a bathroom and when they came back they decided that we needed to go downstairs because it was cooler inside and because the band at the time they were down there was playing Sublime.  So we go downstairs and they are now in an 80s kick doing covers of Def Leopard and Guns and Roses and they also did a punkish cover of Glory of Love from the Karate Kid.  Toni, Ryan and I were having a blast, not so sure about Bret so then it became the whole "oh my friend isn't having fun" thing and I worried about him for a while.  Finally I was getting tired and we got the hell out of there.  So today I am talking to everyone and I guess Bret had a good time but Toni and I decided he's so damn entertaining that he needs to come out with us again.  Woohoo!  Everyone got along which is the part I was most worried about, therefore I found last night to be a COMPLETE SUCCESS!!!
