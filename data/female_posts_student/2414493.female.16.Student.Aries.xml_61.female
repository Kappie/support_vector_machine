Just being in the presence of so many talented people and listening to them play seamlessly and confidently makes me question where I am really going with this all. And I just wish I could shrug it all off and go outside and take a walk and come back whole again.  The Internet is public domain. Should this be reason to regret that I'm keeping this blog? It's selective exhibitionism, yes. Selective. Maybe some of you would be better off forgetting that this ever exists? It's that whole issue of the things you want to tell and how true those things will be when they come out for an audience. Some things are better off under the surface.  There is some inexplicable pall over me that'll probably disappear with Monday morning, but until then, I'm left to wonder some screwy things. How do I get myself out of this? Hard work, probably. This reclining and typing and thinking probably isn't doing so much for me.  But I am surrounded by saints. St. Steve (or Shredder), thanks for comic relief--that phone call, lol. And then there's Charles and Peter and Andrew, in no particular order...I should probably just give a weak "I'm ok" smile and move on.  My hands smell like mayonnaise and something else. Cream sauce? lovely.
