This is now and sometimes you just gotta face reality in the eye. I have. now its your turn. you are no friend to me.. all those words you ever said all those things you ever claimed .. were lies. you made promises you cudnt keep. and even tho i havent listened to any of those promsies anyone has made in the past for a long time ill admit that a part of me believed the promises you made. And once again the doubts release itself and i am back to where i started at. I believed the promises you cudnt keep.
