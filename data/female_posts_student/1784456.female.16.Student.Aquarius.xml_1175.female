Every one have a good Christmas? I got every thing I wanted! Yeay! I hope you did. I went to see my relatives on Boxing Day and it reminded me that Christmas is also about being with people, spreading joy and all that stuff. I felt really content. I haven't felt like that for ages. Any way, my cousins were there and I haven't seen them for years! One of them works in Houston and has a girlfriend in New York he sees at the weekends! (Geez, that's like some one in England having a partnare *how the hell do you spell that?* in Moscow! partnaire? uhh companion? Yeah that's better. Never mind. I'm getting back to writing again! Yeay! I used to write a load of stuff when I was younger and I've kind of stopped, hey I got A* from my teacher for my GCSE story! (Hehe, guess that tenner worked... hehe) Mmm I'm boring. YEAY!
