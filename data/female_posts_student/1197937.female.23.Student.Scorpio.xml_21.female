Fundamentals of Business Writing February 25, 2003 Homework #6: Goals   Twenty-Two... Last week, I was writing a birthday card to one of my friends, wishing her a very merry 22nd.  As the friend I was sharing the card with gently brought to my attention, that was sweet and all, but too bad she was actually turning 23.  "Twenty-three?!?" I shrieked.  "That's ANCIENT!"  Then, it dawned on me: I had better make the most of my time before I become practically extinct.   In five years... A recent survey concluded that the peak age for men is 42, while that for women is 28.  In the next five years, I would like to prove the validity of that statement, and the years after, its fallacy.  At age 28, I would like to devote a serious portion of my energy into a fruitful and rewarding career, but also retaining a hopeful glimmer of romanticism.  I once watched a scene in a movie where, in a warm and cozy apartment, a girl who is seated behind a mahogany desk cluttered by manuscripts and an antique typewriter is engrossed in a novel whose pages are yellowed and crinkled from use, oblivious to the gentle tapping of the rain or the urgent sloshing of cars on the street.  I hope that once in a while, I can transform into the girl in this scene, allowing myself to discover a passion and making the time and space in my life for that passion.  In ten years... While career defines me at 28, I hope that family will become the axle of my life when I am 32.  I have no goals or expectations as to when or how Mr. Man will enter the picture, because that matter is best left one of life's X-Y-Z's.  Our house will be charmingly simple, affordably comfortable, and child-proof for the two kids whose births have miraculously caused no alterations in my figure.  Success at this point will be defined by how well I balance work and domestic life.    In thirty years... If I have made it this far, my one goal is to keep going, stronger than ever. I hope to be more loving and lovelier than ever, wiser and sillier, rosy and rotund.  I will be proud of the lines on my face, because there is a memory behind each.  I would like to sit with my husband on a porch swing, talking about our children and reminiscing about our times together through the thick and thin, dentures and Depends.  If I have grandchildren, I would tell them that life is a bag of jelly beans: you never know what you're gonna get, but you're guaranteed something soft and sweet if you keep on reaching in.
