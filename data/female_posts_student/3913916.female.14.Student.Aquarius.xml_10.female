We should at least love the country where we were born. Jose Rizal died without seeing our country rise up from all the fight the war or whatsoever before. But we saw it. We should at least try to keep the peace and unity we have now. Love our country. Take care of that peace. And do all these for the sake of those who fought for the peace we have now.
