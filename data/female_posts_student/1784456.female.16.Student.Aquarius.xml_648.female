(I bet that isn't spelt right, please don't kill me!) Can you speak cheesish, is it a real language or does some one want to know all the cheeses in the world? Has some one really been sad enough to find out all the cheeses! Aaah too many questions swimming round the gunk in my head! Sorry... just trying to spread some random thoughts!
