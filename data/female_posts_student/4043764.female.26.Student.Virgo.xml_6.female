Today, I wish I were feeling more entrepreneurial because I need more cash before I start school. I guess I need to send in dumbed down resume.  In other news... a friend of mine who works near the boy suggested that I post a sarcastic "employee of the month" blog about him. Last night, I designed one which featured a picture of him fishing and lots of references to his playing grab-ass with co-workers. Perhaps I am being vain (in thinking that more than 2 friends read this thing) and a little sympathetic to the boy's indecisive cowardliness (the only real reason someone could give me up as a girlfriend/potential wife) - but I became worried that he would be devastated if he ever found the post. So, no employee of the month post... for now. It depends upon how much venom snake lady wants to spew later.  Last night, I had this conversation with atlblingbling, where I revisited the whole "what does he mean, he is not trying to replace me?" conversation... Of course, he can't replace me!  What other girlfriend would give up her reasonable level of comfort to sit in a hollowed out boat for 12 hours out of the day - for a whole week - to  urlLink fish in the Amazon , be blistered by the sun (for the record, I - with all this melanin in my skin - got SUNBURNED), be attacked by flying fish and be at the center of a piranha feeding frenzy? [the fucking princess is afraid of fucking termites...]  What girlfriend would watch  urlLink TVLand  - Chips, Dragnet, and Emergency - drink beer with you all night and provide critical commentary about gender identity and class? What girlfriend helps you write your thesis when your ass is under fire by your advisor, you have three days before the deadline (and it's so good that it later gets you an "A" and a nomination to present your thesis to the entire school)? What girlfriend nearly carries your drunk, heavy ass home after she's drunk you under the table? What girlfriend would practically beg you to go to the golf course with her? What girlfriend flies to  urlLink Togo  (ok, granted, it was from Nigeria) to meet you on Valentine's Day? What girlfriend will sit with you and your junk and not even complain about that junk (maybe I complain a little, but I sure as shit didn't make you clean it up either)? What girlfriend has a fabulous time with you, even when you are wearing a bright orange tracksuit and driving a '66 cadillac (ok,that's kind of cool and not something I would have to *put up* with, but still...an orange tracksuit)? What girlfriend have you ever had who was funnier, cooler and more outspoken than I? What girlfriend does all this AND is an active participant in/contributor to *the* best sex you've ever had in your LIFE?  Somehow, this started out as a sentimental thing and got a little dirty - I guess I should end...
