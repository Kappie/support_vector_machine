The job's so perfect for a student that I don't feel like hassling with the implications of telling these guys to go fuck themselves or god forbid setting the affirmative action machine in motion.  But it was a bad day.    I've been spending a lot of time with my new man lately.  Kind of letting other things go to the wayside.  My life as a single was so peaceful and well rested.  I used to sit on a pile of pillows in my closet and read for hours.  I used to sleep for like eight or nine hours every night.  But everything with him is all shiny and intense.  The night hours are too magic to sleep through.  I love this part of being with someone.  I wish the days of this happy insanity weren't always so numbered.  But before we know it, we'll be routine.    Still pretty certain I am going to get heartbroken, but what the hell.  That's no reason to avoid it.  It's all pretty and spring here.  Flowers everywhere.  Ran and shine.  Today it's rain, which I like better.  I walked to school swinging my patriotically colored umbrella and hopping in puddles.  I feel so alive.
