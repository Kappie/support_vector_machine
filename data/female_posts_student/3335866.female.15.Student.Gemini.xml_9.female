Seeing as this is the first significant interaction with a boy I've had (don't say it- at almost-15, I know I'm pathetic), Henna keeps on pressuring me to "snatch him". I don't think she's serious. At least, I hope she's not. God, I hope she's not. She's probably just attempting to live vicariously, as her own romance isn't going anywhere at the moment.   Does it count as flirting if a boy takes note of things you've said, continually comes over to talk to you, high-fives you on discovering you've read the same book, and sits 5 inches away from you when there's about 5 square feet of available space? I wish I knew. I think it does. Does it? Hello? Anyone? It seems significant that a female friend of his seemed uncomfortable with our being so chummy. I think a lot of it was because I was giving off I'm-into-you vibes, something a more experienced person would have been able to prevent. He kept on coming over to me, and I kept on moving away quickly. I wasn't sure if he was flirting, but no way was I even going to take the chance of being weird with my almost-friend's guy. Although, I can't say much for her taste. If I had been free to flirt, I'm not sure what I would've done. The most significant thing about this whole thing is that he was into me. He doesn't go to my school, so he doesn't know me as a dork. For a little while, I was able to step back and see myself as a stranger would, and it was enlightening. I wasn't a dork, I was a tall, fairly pretty girl who said amusing things and was into him. Sorry for rambling on about this. I'm just trying to get my head around this new type of interaction.   Although, my breasts were showing a tiny bit, so that might have been the basis of the whole thing. Actually, hmmm... When we were discussing who would be what food, he said I would be a pancake, because I'm "flat". I have a C cup. Okay, this is a good excuse to be mad at him. Breast-obsessed teenage-boy bastard. And with that, I am over this whole thing. It's probably better this way. Once in an interview-thing in  Seventeen , a boy discussed how a girl had recorded their encounters in detail on her blog. He said it was completely creepy. I want to avoid that, because of course magazines are the true word of God and I should always do everything they say. Including buy a $150 pair of pants with chains just because Hilary Duff has them. Chuh.   Song That Is Currently Annoying The Hell Out Of Me:  The Reason  by Hoobastank. If I may be so bold- Hooba stank  is right. This is just another song I hate for no reason. Also,  My Immortal  was driving me insane when it was being played constantly.   Note: This is my most schizophrenic entry to date. I think. Good night.
