For example, in an interesting conversation I was having with my twin, I presented a hypothesis:  "Sometimes, people flatter themselves by pretending to believe something untrue."  The benefits for this sort of behavior are: 1) You receive attention 2) You receive sympathy 3) You receive compliments as people struggle to straighten you out.  This may sound fine and dandy as an old woman, but I have come to believe that this type of behavior can become very self destructive, because, in order to establish the untruth, you have to embed the lie into your everyday life. This means, you actually have to implant it into your reality. In a sense, although you know that it isn't the truth, part of you has accepted it, in order for it to be in your 'reality'. And now, each time you confirm the lie, it wiggles a little deeper, until, when you've gotten your sympathy, your attention, your compliments, it's out of reach! It's really dug in there! The panic sets, in and your search for the truth becomes a little panicked. The people who were previously consoling you notice the change in mood, and are confused.  The more I write this out, the more it seems horrible. I think I used to do this a lot more than I do now. But I can now see the vital importance of not purposefully poisoning your own perspective, because it's the only outlook you have.   Anyway, it's just something I noticed a long time ago, when I think everyone did it more frequently. Tell me if you think there's a flaw in my hypothesis, because I'm defiantly not a great judge of character, not like some of you out there.
