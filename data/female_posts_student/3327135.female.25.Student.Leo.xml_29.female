To tell the truth, I think Flora's hairstyle in this series does not suit her at all. I think among all, her hairstyle in The Family Man is the best. :)   Actually, I didn't plan to watch VCD for the whole weekend. I wanted to restart studying for my GRE but just too lazy to read those books. They are not as "interesting" as watching Flora's series for the second time. Hahaha..  So I just ate, slept and watched VCD for the whole weekend. Good life, huh?
