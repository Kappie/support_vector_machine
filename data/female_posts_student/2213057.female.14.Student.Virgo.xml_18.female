(that doesn't make it better). then i went outside in the storm. i love them so much. thunder and lightning have me in awes, but i'm also scared of them. i love, LOVE storms!! and rain!!! i forget what i did for the rest of the night... something... i think. the storm made it better. plus i talked to heather and lesley on the phone and decided what to do about HER. that made it better too. after this class we'll have a talk. speaking of which. the buses aren't running today because the weather is crazy so we don't have many people in class. spencer and i were the only ones who wanted to play. he was wuite nice to me. we played together at the end. he's pretty good and i like jingle bell jazz. plus heather's mom (who drove me to school) thinks i'm funny. today (i think) will be good. by the way, jenna, heather and lesley, i don't want to leave. lewis is acting like his snobby self, again. maybe he's just madly in love with me...
