Well, basically it's about a journey most women has to get through in her life. The first book tells a story of Bridget falling in love with her boss, Daniel Cleaver, and gets involved with him. Later on, she finds out that he's actually already engaged to an American woman. Daniel isn't the only man in her life, there is also the lovable Mr. Darcy, who at first doesn't seems too lovable. They first meet at a family gathering, giving each other the wrong impression. But as time goes by (and as Daniel breaks her heart), she finds something she's been looking for in Mr. Darcy. I love this book. It's sooo girl power, in a simple sense. I learn a lot from this book, because Bridget is so down to earth and just like average women. I'm still reading the second books, called  The Edge of Reason . But so far, the story is about Bridget and Mr. Darcy's relationship. The first is already turned into a movie with the same title, staring Renee Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant as Daniel, and Coling Firth as Mr. Darcy. The second one...still 'in talk' status, but already listed as 'upcoming'.
