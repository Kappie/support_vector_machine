It'd be cool if it started on September 1st, though. I don't know why I find that cool, I just do. Actually, it would be awesome if school started right now. I'm SO bored and I've got about a million expectations and such for it. Beforehand, I'd type that I hated school and wish that it NEVER existed, but now I can type freely that I'm entirely glad that it exists and that I want it to come, NOW!  I've told you all of this before, in one of my previous entries, have I not? Well, whether you believe it or not, I am way more pumped up and ready for the school year, then before. Hard to believe huh?  Why am I so pumped up? Just read the reasons I listed below and you'll find out.   Reason #1: Back To School Shopping.     I, like many other school kids that I know of, absolutely adore back to school shopping. Some kids love shopping for clothes and other things associated with their wardrobe while others love shopping for new notebooks, binders, pens, pencils, etc... Personally, I love both. They're both fun to do. Especially since this year I'm having my whole style done over.   Reason #2: Changing The Personality.     Nicole, Sarah, and I have all decided to be extremely outgoing this year. This makes my personality change that I mentioned in a previous entry, easier. There is always safety in numbers. We're not going to be mum this year and we're not going to stand for any shit piled upon us. If someone tries to walk over us, they are going DOWN. Trust me, if someone messes with me this year, I'm not going to take it lying down like I did last year. I'm sick of being made fun of... People are not going to drag me down. I'm going to say how I feel, when I feel it. I'm not keeping everything in. If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. If not, then you better watch out...  Ah, I have to get going now. Dinner calls...  Love,  Kel.
