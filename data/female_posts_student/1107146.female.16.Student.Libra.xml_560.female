That's from my paper, and I thought it sounded really slick, so I posted it here, hoping that when I read over this BLog in the future I'll see this and go, "Man...that was slick."  I can't hear anything, I've been recording all day. Aaaah. But it sounds pretty good, except for the vocals, since I couldn't hear myself sing by that point.  I drove the Acura today, it was sweet. They gave me the owner's manual to look at, it's awesome. I going to bug my mom to death now. HAHAHAHA. I must have it. Even she said, "It'd be nice if you had you're own car," and I said, "Yeah, it really would, too bad I don't have a job," and she said, "Oh." YES!  And a Happy Antiphilanthropist Birthday from me to Lindseyreid once again, as I hath done on The BLog, and for what it's worth, since the name of this BLog basically entailed a "not-people-person". Whee, HBD!   It's time to go and do...something else. Until we meet again, friends.
