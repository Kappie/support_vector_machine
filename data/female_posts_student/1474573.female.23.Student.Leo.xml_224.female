I guess that's why the Acentos Mantra is    The New Hotness    Now I've never been the type of writer to write and then just get up on the mic read. The mic is not my friend, it never has been however it has been where alot of my battles with myself have been fought. I'm a secretive person by nature and I've suffered a great deal because of the details in my life that I'm unwilling to share and  sometimes going up on the mic does that for me. Helps me relieve the tension and the pain. I won't go so far as to ask for help but at least for a little bit I can share, yet somehow still  keep my distance.   Besides I'm far too obssessive and not nearly articulate enough to write on the fly like that. It's really funny, especially when I FIRST started reading I would have this  really eager stance on stage that just  screamed "love me, love me please! I have something important to say! really!"  So continuing,I've been blocked lately. Not that I haven't been writing..... I have but there's been this emotional block which has kept from from going in deep. When I say that I've never really been a poet it's because I honestly no longer respect words the way my compatriots do..the beauty of the line, the delicate rythm of words. My style is like an elephant in a china shop, clumbsy and confused. I ease up over time and space and interesting characters that unfold and surprise and plotlines that twist and turn   In my opinion the only thing that's made any of the poetry I've written at all interesting is the angle in which i look at things, more WHAT I have to say then how I say it. There is a certain insightfulness with which I'm so completely out  of touch with these days. In short, I ain't got anything important that important to say All of I have are descriptions of my days and my nights and the miracles in between  So i sat down at the bar and did it. Just wrote what was present. I had to force myself not to care what anyone thought. I battled with an undeniable immaturity ,slapped myself and screamed "Diane! grow the fuck up!"  I'm a smart gal who's immature and inexperienced as all hell and it's so frustrating because I'm so concious of it.  but for a little while  there was the word and the word was me    let the poetry be your prozac   - s.b.rojas    [..and] let the healing begin!! !  -Will (good will hunting)    and i did    .....thanks
