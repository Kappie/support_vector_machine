It's the people that ruin work for me. Fuck them. I put in an application at Jillians today. It looks almost as good as Adventure Land. Adventure Land has had my application on record since they started hiring. Bastards.  So the good for today. I went shopping with mommy! It was fun. I saw Kevin at Kohls. Got a couple of nice shirts. I got to drive home. :)  Drivers Ed starts Tuesday. Two days until July 4th.
