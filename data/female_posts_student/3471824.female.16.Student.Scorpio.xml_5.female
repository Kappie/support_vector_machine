I mean, putting 'able to think up good titles on the spot' isn't exactly something useful you could put on your resume. But who cares? I'll just type in some random word or something I haven't updated in a while. I was too lazy, I think... Magden's going to abandon MUDwolf and start a circlemud game. Good idea, in my opinion. There's alot of really fascinating areas and such on the internet for circlemud. In fact, I downloaded the circlemud area creater (or AC) 9Don't ask why, I was looking for furcadia stuff at the time. Furcadia's boooooring. You can't carry more than one item at a time!). Maybe I could submit an area or something to him if I create it using the AC..... Too lazy to write more.
