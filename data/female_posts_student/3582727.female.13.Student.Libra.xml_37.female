My new bed isn't here yet, but my mom did make navy blue curtains. Which are...darker than I wanted them. Hm. How peachy.  My template's really screwy on my mom's computer. About a third of the way down the background becomes really dark green, and the last third of the page is medium green. And the quote, which should be at the bottom, is on my sidebar. For a moment I was frightened. But no, 'twas only my damn computer.   I was pretty darn sure that I had something else to say, but I can't remember what it might have been. Oh well.  I've been a mighty good Blogger recently, haven't I?
