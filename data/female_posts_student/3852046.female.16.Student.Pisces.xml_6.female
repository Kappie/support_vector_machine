It is quite weird I feel that I connect with him really well and am starting to like him as in potential b/f kinda of guy. I am not sure as I feel quite overwhelmed as these feeligns came over me all of a sudden. I dont know how he feels about e adn wish I could ask him but do not know how. If the guy I am talking about reads this please post on your blog or e-mail me, I think you know who u are. I will give u a hint your grandad is a teacher at my school.  The All Blacks wona gainst aussie last night, was a tough game but we got in and gave it our best 16-7 to us :-) yay. thats it from me today  so Im out PEACE
