In May,  urlLink Steve  wrote a letter to  urlLink Ken  outlining that he had some concerns with our move to  urlLink Bio21  (and he's not the only one) and got a pretty fobbish off reply, so I took it upon myself to write to the education officer at  urlLink UMPA,   urlLink Daniel Ooi,  who I met when I went along to a student representitives meeting, outlining Steve and Kens letters.  He took a while to reply, and it wasn't so useful, but we weren't really expecting anything useful, but apparently he has been talking to people because Ken told  urlLink Mark  that some of his students were creating trouble at UMPA about Bio21, so at least Ken has realised that we're serious about getting the short end of the Bio21 stick.
