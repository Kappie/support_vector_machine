I will hopefully leave my pit which now smells like a rubbish bin since ive cleaned out my bag... i hope my parents wont enter it. The smell reminds we of the time I dragged home a huge roll of flat foam with little foam spikes on it. It made my room smell like crap... like my brothers room used to. It was inconvenient since I had actually cut my hand open the day before and had to spend all day there. I almost suffocated. But anyway, back to the part about me being lifeless...  My parents are going to drag me to the movies again... tonight *oh god* and im going to see shrek 2... i would be okay with this, since most of the time, if you see a movies which you enjoy, you seek to find more pleasurable veiwing in the sequel of the movie, except for the fact it is a cold night and when its a cold night, my parents leave the house wearing puffy wooly jumpers which smell like dishwashing liquid and lavender (not a nice combination since the dishwashing liquid is lime scented) I know I shouldnt critisise for I often wear a huge shit-green coloured jumper that ive stolen from my father's draw, but not ever to the movies. I find you get judged and judge more at the movies and this will make me self-conscious. So i dont wear hobo jumpers to the pictures. But if you are seen with company such as your parents wearing jumpers, its embarrasing for you, even if the people around you dont give a shit about what they're wearing, you feel like they do (thats what self-consciousness is to me) and thats what worries you. If these random normal people who you've never met and will never meet in your life dont like what your parents are wearing..........  You've never seen my parent's jumpers...
