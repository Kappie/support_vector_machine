Looks like the majority of gymnasts  urlLink agree  with me, even those out of contention for the medals and hence without a stake in the judging of the final round.  Of course, there's no mention of any of this on US TV that I've seen, which isn't wholly suprising. It's just like we've heard little about Gary Hall Jr's resentment towards Phelps and his spot in the relay team that finished third that is apparently all over the Australian media. Even the Aussie athletes are talking about it in post-race interviews; how there's talk that Hall has lost all faith in his country and his Olympic team because they made a decision to put a player in the relay that didn't deserve to be there - purely so he might achieve an out-of-reach record by winning a certain amount of gold.  But, regardless, I have to agree with one of the last sentences in the linked article above that went something like this:   Did Paul Hamm do enough to make a successful comeback for gold? The only answer that matters now, is: yes.
