It's like why do i even bother getting out of bed, because i know how the day is going to turn out.  I reckon they should replace Sunday with another Friday, then at least i'd get some enjoyment out of the day, instead of being stuck doing boring things. Then to top it off, its not like you can even watch decent T.V. on sunday! our cable is broke so i'm stuck with 5 channels, and i'd forgotten how bad telly is on sundays.  Anyway, its nearly monday, which means 5 days of work and no breaks. I'm trying to think of sometime happy to end with, cos don't wanna just moan (yes thats right, i have matured...a bit). So.....yeah i've found one good thing that we'd be lost without on a sunday, sunday dinner! the only time in the week i get to eat a meal which isn't at 10pm (cos thats when i get in from work). So there you go.  I know i didn't make sense today, but it's a sunday :/ gonna stop saying that word...  Love Laura xx
