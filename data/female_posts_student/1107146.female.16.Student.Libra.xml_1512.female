He came to see abby off to Junaluska, not alaska, which is where i just got back from.  oh, by the way, there's an internet cafe here, $1.25/30 minutes as opposed to the .75/min on the cruise, so we should be on a lot.  anyway, we're having fun.  i guess.  No one's really here.  3 hour worship services with people who treat us like we're three.  Fun.  Gotta love it.  So, yeah...
