I don't think it was very good - I had to leave a lot of stuff out, because John the Baptist was an extremely prominent figure before and during Jesus' time. Hopefully Mrs Mason will be kind, and give me an A+ for it anyway - it was longer than most people's, and it was written well too.  After English today, Ms Roberts asked me what "the story" was - about my avoiding submitting a pair of essays this term. I told her there wasn't a story - to be honest I had no excuse apart from disorganisation ... she was a bit angry - but I made an effort to make conversation with her, and she was nice back - really *cute* actually. (Ms Roberts, if you are reading this, I suggest you ignore this last paragraph).  Listening to the Shebang at the moment - time for "ponder this" ... does the invisible man get sunburnt? Fifi says no ... Marty asks again, "does the invisible man get sunburnt?" ... Fifi says yes. If all the world is a stage, where does the audience sit? Fifi: The audience is God, and he sits on the moon. Marty asks again ... Fifi says, "in the ocean" - well pondered.  Okay, you're probably wondering why my title is about the pope ... well, Pope John Paul says that feminism is destroying the concept of a family. And that homosexuality is evil ... bloody Catholics. People wonder why I hate the Catholic religion so much - this is why!!! They say stupid things like that. (No offense intended on any Catholic person, except the Pope. I know and adore many Catholics, including my 3 sisters and 2 of my friends, so I'm not bagging you, just your religion).  Anyway, I really shuld do some work (which I will begin as soon as Mother leaves the room - for obvious reasons). So, I'll write more later.
