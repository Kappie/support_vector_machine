It's like these demented looking hamster thingys with poppy eyes and little black hats on...and human teeth? I don't know what those guys were smoking when they thought of that commercial, but it freaks me out. My brother thinks it's the funniest thing ever...so that makes it even more annoying when it comes on, because he starts giggling,  yes giggling , uncontrollably EVERY time. The song is even more disturbing...I have no clue what they're talking about, some new sandwhich, but there's little pop-up "talking clouds" that pop up whenever their freakish mouths open...dancing mexican hamsters...greeeat idea. If you ever want a commercial that caters to people who find amusement in dancing mexican hamsters promoting a sandwhich, hire stoners or crackheads for your advertising people.  But as weird as that commercial is, I can honestly say that it does hold my interest for the 60 seconds it's on...way to go Quizno's! I'm proud to say that I eat sandwhiches from a restaurant that advertises with dancing mexican hamsters...! ;)  Found a picture of the dancing hamsters if you're curious...I'm not exactly sure how to upload or put pics into messages yet, so here's the link to the Quizno's site...sorry - www.quiznos.com
