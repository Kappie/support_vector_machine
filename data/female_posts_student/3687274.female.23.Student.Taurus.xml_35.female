Perhaps my darling Ned w0uld be willing to stay with them if it means my happiness and a night with the girls. He's a peach about that sort of thing. Pardon my funny mood here. I need adult company.   You know, you have a habit of calling while the kids are talking to their dad, so I don't even realize you called until hours later when Ipick up the phone to dial 1-900-whythefuckdoesn'tanybodycallme and hear the stuttered dial tone.
