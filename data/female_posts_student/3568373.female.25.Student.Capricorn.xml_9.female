This means that we are closed during the day and open in the evenings for cold sandwiches and a full bar. What this also means is i am almost broke. Not too fun. But hey! at least i got in 5 hours of TIPS training on monday. This was a class that we all had to attend in order to be able to prevent and deal with drunk people. Responsible publicans. One thing i never knew was that carbonated mixers allow alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream faster. Hmmmmm. Interesting.  On other interesting notes, my parents are sailing the carribean right now. They missed their flight to san juan originally but managed to pay a small fortune to catch a later flight. Im sure blackberry brandy and red wine had nuthin to do with that one.
