As always the  urlLink Free Agent (Avaliable players list)  and  urlLink draft history report  have been updated.   To view your teams current roster simply go to your teams page and click on Minor Leagues. All of the drafted players are automatically placed in AAA. Everyone will have to call up their 25 man roster before the season starts.  I'm gonna be working on the site later today so that team links appear on the opening page. Currently you would need to click on a link like Standings to find the teams.
