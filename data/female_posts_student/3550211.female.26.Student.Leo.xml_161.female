I couldn't stop yelling at the idiots who worked at my university.  Oh, the things I said to them within the confines of my own head. I was brilliant I tell you. I told them off, somethin' good. Realizing, of course, that I was just making myself nuts, I figured it best to actually hear what they administrators had to say. So, I called them on my break.  Automated answer. "Please press zero to speak to a representative." I press zero.  "Please hold, we're currently experiencing a high level of calls. We appreciate your patience and the next representative will be with you just as soon as possible."  So I hold.  And hold.  And hold.   Please hold, we're currently experiencing a high level of calls. We appreciate your patience and the next representative will be with you just as soon as possible.   "Fuck you!" I yell at automated voice. And I'm thinking, that if I hear this mechanical woman's voice one - more- time, I'm going to snap.  And yet, I continue to hold.  Of course by now, my 10 minute break, is turning into my 20 minute break. A terminating offense, I'm sure. And by this point, I'm beyond irritable. I'm in the parking lot walking in circles, screaming at the top of my lungs, words that would have made sailors blush. People are looking at me like I'm some kind of nut job, which irritates me even more, so start flipping them off. I'm hating everybody. No one is safe from the wrath of jenn.  And then she answers.   "Hi, my name is Suzy DumbShit. What can I do for you?"   Scatter my brains against the wall, please.   "Um, yeah. There's been some kind of mistakeâ€¦"  Minutes later the conversation was over, and more surprisingly, my problem was fixed. Evidently, they never received my "loan request form."  How  this is possible, is beyond me. Considering my extreme need of financial aid, I find it somewhat surprising that I would simply forget to send in my "loan request form." No sense in arguing over this point though. I'll bring it in this afternoon, thank you very much and have a wonderful day.  I know you are all rejoicing for me. But please. Calm down. Maintain your excitement level to a minimum. And sorry, there are no refunds for your donations. The "jenn fund," will always be active, so please keep sending your charity in my direction.  You really have no idea how much I crack myself up  (knocks on head)  in here.  The car, once again in my grasp. Traveling to Europe, still a hope. Life is once again back to normal.  Whatever, that means.
