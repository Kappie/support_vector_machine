When I later came out to my car to go home, I saw the little white paper on my windshield and sighed as my heart sank.  It was only $10, but I still felt ashamed.  This added yet another crack in my perfection facade that I try so hard to keep up.  Finally, after accepting the fact that I had gotten the ticket, I moved back into an apathetic state.  It was really no big deal, right?  Let me set up the situation for you.  My first class was at 11:40am this morning.  By the time I get to school to find a parking space, all the legal ones are taken.  Usually, however, I do get lucky and find a good one.  Because  urlLink my school  is located in a residential neighborhood, there are certain parking restrictions to accomodate the complaining neighbors.    I was driving down Mitty Way at approximately 11:30, with no parking spot in sight.  I did not want to be late to class; I have never been late to class ever.  So I weighed my decision carefully.  There were two possible punishments I could receive: a $10 parking ticket issued by my school, not by Santa Clara County police, or I could get a detention for being late to class, which would linger on my school record.  I chose the $10 ticket.  I parked in a "no parking zone" and went to class.  In addition, I thought that since my class was only 55 minutes, that it was unlikely that the little old parking lady would tag my car that soon.  How naive!  Well, it actually kind of feels good that getting my first ticket is over with.  It could have been worse!
