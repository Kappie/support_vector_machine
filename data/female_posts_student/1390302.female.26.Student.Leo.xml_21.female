A show called “In Search Of…” which shows a variety of strange and sometimes utterly unbelievable things did a segment on Psychic Spies.  At first I just pushed it aside, dismissing it for complete and total bullshit –then I watched it, and looked into it more and I am not so sure anymore.  Something I didn’t know was that the US Military uses Psychic Spies, using a technique called Remote Viewing, to spy on foreign governments during times of war –its all very hush hush! Shaking my head I watched as this young man –a Remote Viewing Student- spied on a woman who had been planted in Los Angeles as a test of his skill.  He began to sketch using images he had gotten using an ESP technique and when all was said and done he had sketched –to nearly exact detail- the place where this young woman had been planted.    That’s when I had to swallow my pride and go look it up.  Apparently there are a number of organizations devoted to teaching Remote Viewing to any and every interested party. They even have an association,  urlLink International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA) .    While I will still not hold out its authenticity, I thought it was something to think on.  Something to look up and with all the organizations devoted to its existence, something to take a bit more seriously.    ~Kristyn
