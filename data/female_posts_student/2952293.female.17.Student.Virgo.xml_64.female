I was planning on getting gas this afternoon, I drove past the gas station and noticed a fair price, then right as I passed, my gas light goes on. So I pull over at the next station... and it was more expensive. Then the only pump that I could pull up to, had another car at the pump next to it. The truck was pulled really far up, so my front bumper was by the actual gas pump. I try to pump, but you had to pre-pay. Start to pump and finish, put the cap back on, close up the thing, go to put the pump back on the hook, realize it was only at $14.81 instead of $15. I don't go re-open the gas tank, I just drove off, giving the gas station $.19 of my own money. Damn you.  Then I get to school and park poorly. Elizabeth Chinn told me she was breaking up with me because we didn't tell her we weren't eating at the Spaghetti Warehouse after working at the shelter. That was sad. I felt bad. I went to the dining room, that's where it all began. I was telling some girls that I had to go get my jeans hemmed after school, cause I'm short and it's bad. Alana asked where I got them and I told her Express, and she said, "You can fit into those?" AHHHHHH! She was like, "NO you know I just mean that, because Express doesn't cater to curvy girls!" It was so funny. Then Trisha was telling me about all the fun they had at Ann's and Ann's brother and ya di ya da and all those good times... and I said, "Yeah I read about it on somebody's blog. By the way, I wasn't invited." And Trisha said, "Oh, no offense!" I think you had to be there, cause it really was funny. Katie was talking about somebody, and I said, "Uh... she's right behind you!" SHE WASN'T, BUT IT WAS SUCH A CRUEL TRICK! Sorry about that. I tried to study in the day, it didn't work. I went to Chemistry fourth period. I was telling Doc about how I'm trying to get a job at PromoWest, because I like bands and am interested in entertainment management. Doc said, "You want to be a groupie and sleep with all the bands?!" DOC, EXCUSE YOU! It was great! I went to Cosi for lunch. When I was leaving I got some more ice for my juice, turned around, and then turned back around to say something, and all of a sudden there was a boy there! I screamed and got really scared. I watched Meghan's history presentation after lunch. It was great! Mr. O and I yelled at each other a lot. We were arguing about men and how stupid and bad they are. It was priceless. I ran errands after school. I'm so tired, guys what am I going to do? I'm not studying, help me PLEASE!
