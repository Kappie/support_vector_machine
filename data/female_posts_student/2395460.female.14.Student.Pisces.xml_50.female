Although this is more of a one way function, it's one step closer.  urlLink Bow-lingual , previously only available in Japan, works as a kind of dog translator. It takes your dog's bark and analyzes it into happiness, sadness, frustration, assertiveness, neediness or if they're being territorial. Then it turns the feeling into statement like "I'm ready to play" or "leave me alone". It comes pre-set for some breeds already. Home alone mode records your dog's feelings for up to twelve hours, although I hope you won't be leaving your dog alone for that long. You can get it at  urlLink Petsmart  or  urlLink Advanced Pet Products .   The translator is a wireless microphone you hook onto your dog's collar with a counter part looks like a small walkie-talkie. It's about $60, not too bad, but the thing is, somebody should probably be able to understand enough of what your dog is trying to communicate to you to understand if they're hungry or if they want to go out or if they want to play. This is the kind of thing that probably will be used more as a toy than as a necessity.   We just ordered ours, so a full review and pictures are to come.
