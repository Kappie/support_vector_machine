It's kind of scary to be drinking that much, so it will probably be a while until I drink again.  Last night, however, proved to be the pinnacle of my drinking fun.  I actually got up and danced.  The music was great, the mood was right, and I danced with one of the guys from downstairs.  His girlfriend, who was also there, probably did not appreciate it, but oh well.  It was great.  I'm not even going to go to the Sr/Jr party at Maz's tonight, because I really dont need to be drinking 4 nights in a row.  Even if some awesome music was playing and there was a lot of dancing, I still dont think I'd go. I need like a week to recover.  Erg.  Since when did I become an alcoholic?
