I hope so at least, I mean I can't have done that bad... oh well  I'm supposed to be cleaning my room but I don't feel like it so I'm on the internet instead...  I fell down half of my stairs today when I was coming down here to go on the computer! I fell and yeah it hurt cause I hit my head at the bottom.  3 more exams left!!! and then I shall be freeee as a bird! lol  My mommy was supposed to come home from the hospital today but now they're saying she might be there till thursday :(... And that's her birthday too! awww....  Dylan... this guy was trying to get me to go to the pool with him today, I woulda gone but I didn't really wanna go with him, plus I thought Chad was going to be around and that I might be able to get together with him considering I havn't seen him in almost a week... OH NO! lol not really oh no but yeahh.. I gotta stop waiting around for Chad and doing other stuff cause hes usually doing something and it's boring waiting around.  Okay... so this one guy, who I used to like so so so much... anywho he was talking to someone when I was waiting for Melissa, and Jess and Holly and Brennan and all them to get out of the test (our teacher let us out early) anywho he came by and was talking to someone and he said that they had already marked his test and he got 14/50!!! Like I'm sorry but how the hell do you do that! I mean Mr. Condie (our teacher) said that if you just guessed the average mark you would get would be 7/50.... so he got double that... STILL holy crap I don't get it, and like those questions, at least most of them were not even hard at all! and even if you just got rid of the answers that were really crazy you would like HAVE to do better than that!... I'm sorry but that is just sad.  Okay so now I'm gonna type up all thats on my keychain cause it's boring not doing anything and no one is on MSN, well people are but they're not talking much. -house key -car key (no I don't have a car, I don't even know how to drive I just felt like having  car key so I took one of the many copies my mom has.) -a back to nature (a store) pocket-knife, with a little knife, nail file, tweezers, toothpick and scissors on it. -a little chain thing of those little hoop things for keychains that I found -3 hair elastics (don't ask why) and one PINK, light blue and WHITE lol -a little necklace charm thing thats the chinese symbol for the year of the snake -a Tom Tompson keychain with his painting "The Jack Pine" -a big rock bottle opener -a Charlesglen Toyota keychain -a missisippi chemical corporation keychain... one of those ones that you can like take apart! and I think thats it... I just put all these on this morning when I was waiting for my dad to take me to my exam.... I'll add more tonight and say what I did cause it's fun! lol
