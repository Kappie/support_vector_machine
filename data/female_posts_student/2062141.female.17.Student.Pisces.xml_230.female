SATs early tomorrow morning, then the prom. Stressful. Holy crapmuffins. I gotta study, AND look pretty while doing it. That's hard stuff. I gotta study. I said that on my last post huh. Well it's coming along... we'll see... the math section's gonna kill me. *Death by trigonometry*! In related news, (actually not at all), my yearbook's filling out nicely... i love yearbooks. Whenever i'm bored I always pull them out and look at them. Oo and I gotsta take lotsa pictures before school is out and during this summer so we can continue the scapbook, Charlotte! Good times! That was like the best sleepover we ever had. YAY SUMMER SUMMER SUMMER IT'S SO CLOSE! I look outside, and it LOOKS like summer, but it has yet to FEEL like summer. Two weeks will take care of that.
