I'm actually really glad that I created a new blog page.  I think I'm able to get my thoughts down much more often then I would on paper.  It also has the added benefit of giving B a peak at my thoughts as well. =)    Tomorrow I'll probably go to UCC again.  I haven't been there for a couple of weeks now.  I'll probably try to go to the 9am service so I can have more of the day to study for radiology.  I got a call from Ty, a guy who is involved in starting the new YA group. They're first meeting is next Wednesday, but that's the evening of the Mercer Volunteer Appreciation Dinner. I'm glad that I got that call because I was beginning to think that I'd been forgotten.  Will this be the start of a regulary Bible study?  I really hope so...I feel like I haven't gone to a regular BS in a long time and I'm getting really lazy with my spiritual life.  Speaking of which, I keep forgetting to ask B whether he's made any progress finding a BS of his own.  Didn't he say that he met the leader of the group the last time he was at church?  Speaking of B...we had a conversation last night when he got home from Spirit (a club in New York that he went to w/ Brian and Christina).  I've been really good about not asking him how much he's had to drink whenever he goes out.  I decided that I need just to trust him to be responsible and I genuinely do. Even if he  was  buzzed, I don't think I could tell anyway...   Mainly we talked about my conflicts with Mike.  By the time I actually talked to Mike, I wasn't mad anymore (it's amazing what a nap can do for anger management). I easily forget about disagreements I've had with people. Does this make me vulnerable to being stepped on over and over by people like Mike?  Maybe that's what B is concerned about.  He doesn't want me to be friends with him (not that he wants me to be mean), and I see his point.  Every time I try to be Mike's friend, I end up getting burned sooner or later. I don't need this kind of angst in my life, of course, but for some reason, I can't help but keep trying to be his friend. Why do I keep trying? Here are some reasons why:     1)I have a very strong desire to please people and I just can't stand it when people are unhappy with me    2)Or maybe it's because I feel obligated to be friends with EVERYONE.      3)I learned (probably at Berkland) that I need to love the unloveable, just as Jesus did on Earth. Jesus loved those that were ostracized by others.  He loved the tax collectors, the prostitutes, the lepors... Mike isn't crippled, but he IS a social outcast.   I'm realizing that to be friends with everyone is both not realistic and not healthy.  Afterall, there are certain people (like Mike), who are not "safe" people to be around. He ends up being a discouraging influence because of his complaining attitude, rudeness, and self-centeredness. No, I definately have decided that I'm NOT going to take any more initiative with him, but I won't ignore him either.    I know that B just wants to protect me, but he kept saying "Do what you want" in a frustrated sort of way. For some reason, "It's up to you" just sounds nicer.  Of course he wants me to make my own decision but I couldn't understand why he was frustrated with me. Maybe he was just frustrated at the situation and not really at me. Does he think I'm a pushover because I care about Mike too much? B's been really good about listening to me vent and being sympathetic. Definately a good thing...
