"im 16!" as gwen said, its "15, only better." at 3:01 AM, i was officially 16. how great is that? :D and i slept right through it.      i got SO MANY ecards from people.. even one from a friend who moved to nova scotia!! it was so sweet.. im so touched. thanks to all of you. but one of them stood out in particular. i think that this card takes the cake for the sweetest thing anyones ever done for me.. except for one other thing which i wont get into.  davis  made me a card using flash.. heres the link, i  have  to share this:      urlLink  http://www.ecf.utoronto.ca/~doand/Pikachu/photoshop/hbdayLT.html     basically its pictures of all the things on my wishlist, with captions and such. it was just so sweet because he seemed to know me so well. haha all these pictures are more or less copywrited.. so lets hope he doesnt go to jail over this! lol he even stole his company name..  pikachu engineerings .      thanks to everyone for making this a special day for me. :) and bigups to  davis  for the card.. ;) remember, youre not  that  old.      - L.      p.s. about that email you sent me, davis.. ;) youll get leanne points for quantity, if not quality.
