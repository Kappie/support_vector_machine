I don't know where you found that thing about standing up but what a concept. Its one of those things you would never admit to trying but if possible you could never go back to sitting down.  My roommate has now requested (by email because she is too "shy" to say it to me in person) that we make night times free of any music playing as much as possible (or I could use earphones). I was so shocked at such a request, mostly because I tend to study with my music louder than I was playing it last night, I didn't know what to say but I am sure I will think of something or if you all have any ideas please let me know.  My parents have now sold our house in Montana and are in Oklahoma looking for a new one. I do hope that Oklahoma exists unlike Montana which was something we all just made up (right Adam). I'm not sure that I want to be from Oklahoma but I am sure that I will get used to it in time.   When was the last time you went to a slumber party? Well my friends are having one and it is going to be a blast. Not only do we get to watch girlie movies and do each others makeovers but I have a feeling there is going to be a lot of alcohol consumed. We may even get a video camera so we can show boys we don't have pillow fights in our underwear... or maybe we will just "edit" it out by staging it and cutting it out of the video. We are also planning pranks for the neighbors that we know and we could have a lot of fun with that.   I think this is my last thing. We are going on a farm tour set up by one of our friends in the department. It should be a blast when most of the people leave and we have burgers and beer by a bonfire. It should also be interesting to see the different types of Ag in this area but mostly we are looking forward to the bonfire at the end. I however will not be drinking as lent is not over until Sunday and we will be drinking on Saturday.
