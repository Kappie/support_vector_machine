I forgot to take my calcium pills, but that's okay. I'm what I like to call myself a semi-lack toast and tolerant. I can eat butter and ice cream, but I can only have milk at certain times of the day, otherwise I get really sick. Like I can never have cereal in the morning for example. And that's why I have to take calcium pills.  I want school to start up, it's so boring being by myself EVERY DAY. The best part of my summer was probably going to Enchanted Forrest, and camping overnight with my family, John and Luann. But going to the mall with Katrina was really fun too. Oh yeah, and the Rennaissance Festival.  I have 6 chapters of my fanfiction up. 7 more to go until I'm caught up. Woohoo! But its the last chapters I really have to work on. My pen name used to be arissaviola. Cause I couldn't think of anything and when I can't think of anything I use that. Even though I hate it. Well, I changed it yesterday to Ellie Manchester. I'm not quite sure I like it yet. It just has a ring to it that I like. I was trying to think of something like Lemony Snicket, something stupid like that. Oh well. Oh shit, I should have used Chester Moistmuffins XD  Tommorrow I have to sign up for photobucket, so my images will show on The Underground. They only allow new users to sign up between 10 and 2 so I have to make sure I'm online then. I am also getting a new domain name. But I have to wait for 2 to 4 weeks to sign up for that. I got a shorter URL change, but it makes a million hostdepartment pop-ups show up on my site, so I'm just gonna use the one until I get my domain name.  Well, I wanna finish my fanfiction now.
