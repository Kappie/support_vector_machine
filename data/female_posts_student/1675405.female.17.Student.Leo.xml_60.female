We went to the ice cream shop and split a turtle sundae, and then stopped at Bilo Video to get a movie, and eventually (after much deliberation) decided on Chasing Liberty, Mandy Moore's new flick. Truthfully, it wasn't that great, but entertainment with my best friend was quite enough.   Marie and John have gotten quite chummy lately, and I am so unbelievably happy for her right now that words could not describe.  Not a lot of people know Marie like I do; she has tried from seventh grade on to find a "boyfriend" of sorts, and has not been successful, probably because just like many her age, she was attracted to something she just could not have. Then, completely out of the blue last year someone actually pursued her, and off and on over the past year and a half, they've been "together." I don't necessarily like the boy because he doesn't treat her well, but she is truly in bliss right now, and I don't blame her because for once, something with a boy is actually working out. And I hope that this continues, because I love seeing her so happy.   Oooh... Dad and Sarah are arguing. Sarah got in trouble and is trying to defend a situation that she has no footing on, and her desire to be the "goody goody" her soul cries to be. But it drives me absolutely coconuts because I hate hearing her try to cover the mistake she made-- the only way she can do so is to step all over Matthew. She searches for the temporary solution, and to me, I just cannot see the goodness that my parents think she epitomizes.
