And Guess wat.....we recently had a major 7 period specialist maths SAC....it was applying maths to the real world and the story line was based about me!!!! hehe...it went a little something like this (cant remember exactly but oh well)....Meaghan is an animal lover who is aspiring to be a Vet blah blah...she finds a baby lizard and needs to make a heat box to make it survive blah blah...and then we had to do stuff with the temperatures n things....i was sooooo stressed out about it cause me and my blonde moments, i did some really stupid things and ended up doing 1 question like 3 times cause i kept getting it wrong.... i wasted over 1.5 periods fixing it and i used that much whiteout that the pages were going to shatter if i dropped the book lol...neways....i ended up gettin 38/40.....how good is that...im like so happy :) *dances* hehe      Now its only 40 days till my party!!!! YAY!!!!! and a few more till my bday...      At school sometime next week we are having a "slave Auction"....its where some of our teaches are put up for auction an the highest Yr12 bidder gets "ownership" of them. In the past, teachers hav been made to wear school uniform, male teachers in fairy costumes etc etc.....its a sort of fun payback for all the stress they make us go thru.....and then later in the week...some of the Yr12 students go up for auction and the teachers bid for them......me n my friend are going up as a pair for auction....hmmm should be interesting       Well should go and study for a Chem test tomoz.....here comes another 64%......and its not just me...like the whole class gets that sort of mark, cause the tests arent about the topics we hav been studying...oh well...it doesnt count as part of the study score so who cares.....    I did pretty well today....i didnt forget anything extremely important........i hope ;) lol    TTFN mwah
