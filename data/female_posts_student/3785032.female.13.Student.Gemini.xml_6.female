Mom gave me 10$ bucks and I had 10$ from Vickie = 20$ =:) I bought ghetto tinted sun glasses, a bracelet and a shirt. Not to mention nurishing messy corn. :P Then Julia was supposed to come pick me up with my mother. Oh joy from Simon's house. And I thought she was going to get her nipples pierced. Ouch!!! And mom would of freaked but Julia couldn't find the place. Luckily. Then Simon was supposed to go to a party but decided to sleep over "chez moi".Which was fun except for when Mom blowed up over nothing...When she was being completely hypocrtical I shook my head and she I was teasing her. How could she when she insulted everyone! Anyway. I wasn't happy since she did it infront of simon. And we went to walk lucy at the park and he found it was stupid the way she reacted. We stay there until like 9:30pm. Which was very cool. Then he wanted to pick up this evil, drugee styled jacket but i didnt want him too so he didnt. Or else he would of got "enguler" by my mom and his mom. Next day: Went to ikea. Got materiel for pillows that my mom is going to make me. She offered a summer pass to "LaRhonde". Which would be cool since Lilly has a pass too. Monday: Linda came over around 4pm and we had fun...tanning... And cuz we were in our bathing suits. I had to do my chest. And my top fell down infront of her. Which was not too embarassing since she had already seen me topless/braless when we had to try on bras at lasenza in the same change room...Then we had fruit popcicles. Is that how you spell it? Then we went swimming at the pool across the street from my house. Totally hot guy lifeguard was there. And me and Lilly were playing with the foam sticks...lol...our first boners!! Then we had pizza at my place. Then dropped her off at metro. Then she came back to my house to get her glasses which she forgot. The dumbfuck...lol jk...then walked her back to metro then got tired. AND Went to sleep. Tuesday: Went over to Vickie's place. She got her new shoes. Puma copies. Then we went swimming and saw hot diver boy.. then came back to her place...then went to other bus stop...then missed the bus had to wait half an hour.then got home. Talked to laurie...then ate dinner. then went on computer. Talked to bryce  taryn. Thats pretty much it. Besides the fact that I am sick today and got two books from chapters! yay british books. "They're such a laugh" lol. Me being insulting in british= you bloody tosser....his trouser's snake isn't half as big as my boyfriend's ...lol. less faire.Dont mind me...
