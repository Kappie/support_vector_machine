The experts attribute this fall to the bombings themselves as well as the fact that the French have raised their terror alert in response to the bombings.  The French are starting to take the threat to the world seriously, now that it is hitting so close to home.  Their concern only heightens my belief that this is possibly not the work of ETA.  Why would the French be scared of them?
