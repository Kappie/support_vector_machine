It's sleek, snazzy, and only slightly thicker than the ipod. Additionally, it's not manufactured by Apple, which makes it that much cooler.   So far, I'm loving it. Looks great, feels great, plays great. And definitely works better than my old clunker, which had a tendency to overheat.   I love gadgets. Getting a new toy like this right before my upcoming vacation really makes my day/week/month. Until I realize that there's a better model out.
