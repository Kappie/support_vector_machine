I think there are many girls out there who would also  love  to perform in a pop/rock band, and I'm one of them :D Each time I listen to the radio or CD, I fantasize about myself performing on stage in a really cool rock band with hundreds or thousands of fans (which include my family members and friends) cheering and singing along with me!  Am I dreaming? Haha.. Hopefully, someday, I will be able to fulfil this 'dream' of mine.
