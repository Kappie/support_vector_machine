Recently I have done nothing but revise for my forsaken exams, and, as they are  finally  over, i can enjoy ranting and raving about shit all here. Oh the joy. Anyway, as I said, I have done nothing interesting as of late, but one funny moment did arise recently...well, actually, it didn't, come to think of it. Nothing funny's happened in a  long  time, due to various elements in my life. I have nothing to do this weekend, and nothing to look forward to, so I think I'll just end this post here, it's making reality hit me a bit too hard...ouch...
