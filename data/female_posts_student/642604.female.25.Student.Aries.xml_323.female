I think this was the first time since high school I have gone to the mall looking for nothing in particular to buy.  Anyway, at one point I dragged Bret into Sephora where I marveled that I couldn't find a single thing to spend my GC on.  AND I also found it interesting that someone would spend $20 on BELLY BUTTON LOTION!!!  I don't give a damn if it tastes good, why would anyone buy belly button lotion?  Jessica Simpson went from virgin extrodinaire to married sex fiend marketing BELLY BUTTON LOTION!!!!
