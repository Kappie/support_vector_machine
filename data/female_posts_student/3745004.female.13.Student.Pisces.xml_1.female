Every fiber of your being is set on getting more of that precious life-giving substance. You could still taste the salty sweatness in your mouth and you savor it for as long as possible. The lust consums you in it's dark abyss. Soaring over the fiery forest of death you smell the blood of an innocent. The blood of a child mingled with fear, yet some bravery. The young one was drawing closer to you and you lose all control you may have had over your body. You swifty and silently float down to the forest floor and hid in a rose bush as red as the blood you lust for so infinitely. The child makes it's way into a clearing making it's self vulnerable to even the slightest of dangers. You studdy the child with your darking eyes and find little threat other then it carries a small dagger by it's side. The child stumbles a little to close to your hidding place and you get a good smell of it's blood and great fear. The lust takes a new killing hold on you and you leap out at it in a rush of rose pettles floating harmlessly around you. For a splite second the world is frozen in it's own evil as the darkness consums the child. It screams so earsplitting the next moment before you slash at it's windpipe killing it instantly. Blood poors out of it staining the ground red as you start to bite deeply into the wound, lapping up all the newly killed life withen. With bloodlust becomeing even more over powering you turn animal like in your feeding and gorge yourself so deeply that no other feelings can get though.
