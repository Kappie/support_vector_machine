And then I can make a layout for it too. w00t.   You know what I hate?  Final exams.  They're scary. Our teachers make us take them all in one week and it's poop. I had my Math exam today, which was amazingly easy, but I was soooo scareded of it. I HATE EXAMS. I mean I have to study for the stoopid things. ;_; I've been studying since, like, 2 pm.  IT'S SO BORING !!! I think I'm prepared, though. Condensed study notes, all the way!  Meh. I hate how I'm also extremely busy this week. I have soccer Thursday, Friday, twice Saturday, and Sunday. WHY OH WHY! I can't wait for summer. It's so close yet so far away. The first day of summer, I plan to get a slurpie and watch TeeVee the whole entire day. :D  Anyways, I think I'd better clean up a tad... My room's so messy 'cause I brought all my stoof home on Monday. I'll just like make my bed or whatever. Toodlesness.
