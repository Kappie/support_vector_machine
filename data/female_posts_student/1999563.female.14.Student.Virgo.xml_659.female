[Andy Warhol, 1953]  Why is this one of the most published paintings in the World?     [Vangogh  Starry Night ]  Art is a very subjective thing.  It seems like we should have a set of rules that makes art "good."  For one, this may seem beautiful:   [Jackson Pollock  One ]  Yet others think it was just a childs splatter.  Personally, I love this painting:   [Peit Mondrain]  But others may think its just a series of squares.  I love art that captures imagination.  I don't like art that is just like a bowl of fruit. I mean, I lok at it and I think "Oh, a lovely bowl of fruit..." it doesn't cause me to imagine what the artist was thinking when he or she formed the art.   [Andy Warhol   self Portait ]  Why did he paint this? What is his story? Why does this look so creepy? :)  I think art should be something that should portray God. Not like a picture of some guy sitting on a cloud...but maybe  reflecting his beauty. Reflecting his power..  Art should make you think up to God.  I know you probably never think deep about art, neither do I.  But it is quite and interesting and confusing topic to ponder.
