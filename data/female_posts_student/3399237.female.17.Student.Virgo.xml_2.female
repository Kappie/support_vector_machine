Am trying to think of all the loonies i have met (other than you guys) there are many who think they are my best friends.   The pink shoe guy : who wandered round behind me, rachel and maz in stratford, mumbling something along the lines of "mmm...pink shoes, pink shoes, pinks shoes rule, evryone should wear pink shoes, i like pink shoes, all women...pink shoes"etc etc etc-admittedly it was rachel who was wearing the pink shoes so im happy to know that he thinks that she's his best friend and not me.  The looney monk  in solihull who keeps trying to convince me to donate money to his monastry in germany or somewhere like that-but he really does think that im his best mate-and i notice he has a lady monk friend but i ignore her when she wants my money.  Then theres the  mad women  who like to talk to me at the bus stop.  Oh, and the  mad woman  who lives near su: within the five minutes it takes to walk from the bus to the house, i found out that shes in her 50s, was brought up by her grandmother, with her two cousins, she doesn't work but finds that housekeeping keeps her busier than any other job would, she has a husband and 17 yr old son who dont appreciate her enough, her son is into sport and shes worried about him cos he only ever wants to eat fish and rice, she doesnt like thunder storms which she thinks is because her grandmother didnt either, when theres a storm she hides in the bathroom, and propbably plenty more-and the worrying thing is that i dont walk that slowly and she didnt talk that fast-i think theres a time warp of some kind involved!!!  Thats all i can think of at the mo so...  happy looney-searching folks!
