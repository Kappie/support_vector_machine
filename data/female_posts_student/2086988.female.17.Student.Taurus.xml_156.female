Ahh this was such a good paper :)                        President Bill Clinton             What comes to mind when you hear the name Bill Clinton? Usually the 1998 scandal involving Monica Lewinsky. But out of that one downfall, he has had many achievements during the 8 years of his presidency.                  William Jefferson Clinton was born on August 19,1946, in Hope, Arkansas. He was an excellent student as well as an excellent saxophone player, and once considered being a professional musician. But that all changed once he met President John F. Kennedy and decided to enter a life of public service. Clinton graduated from Georgetown University, and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He then received his law degree in 1973 from Yale University, and entered politics in Arkansas. In 1976, Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and then won the governor’s race in 1978. After losing the election for a second term, he then regained the office 4 years later, and served until he defeated George Bush and Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election.                      During Clinton’s first year in office, he focused on passing legislation that improves health care and family life. Another legislation is passed that reduces the deficit and increases handgun safety. Plus, in 1993, the NAFTA trade agreement is passed which allows freer trade between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Clinton did all these remarkable things in just his first year of office.                       In 1994, the Clinton administration passes a Crime Bill that adds100,000 new community police officers to the streets, bans assault weapons, and the administration created a Violence Against Women Act, which is the first federal effort to address domestic violence issues.                        Then in 1995, a major Bosnian peace settlement was worked out in Dayton, Ohio, which brought to end the largest campaign of force in the history of NATO’s existence. After re-election in 1996, President Clinton focused on raising the minimum wage and setting up welfare reform. The administration also passed a Telecommunications Reform bill to improve competition in the industry and enable parents to monitor programs with violent content. Plus, the Safe Drinking Water Act is created to ensure that communities can purify their drinking water.                   In 1997, the Clinton administration signed the Balanced Act, which eliminates the $290 billion budget deficit by 2002. Also in 1997, legislation is passed to provide additional children’s education and health care funds, and for the first time in 35 years, a president sighs a bill that modernizes the Food and Drug Administration process.                 Then in 1998, for the first time since 1969, the federal government has a budget surplus. President Clinton supported using the surplus to “Save Social Security first.” Also, President Clinton played the major role in the Good Friday Peace Accords between Catholic and Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland and he also played another important role in the Wye River Memorandum between Benjamin Netaryahu and Yassir Arafat.              In 1999, President Clinton hosted a Middle East summit for the continued work on the Middle East peace process. Another legislative is also passed that increases modernization in the banking industry, which replaced the law that, had been in effect   since the Great Depression. Also, the Work Incentives bill was passed, which was one of the most important legislative advances for people with disabilities.                 In 2000, the final year of President Clinton’s presidency, he worked to pass the Senior Citizen’s Freedom to Work Act, which ensured that senior’s can continue to earn revenue passed the normal retirement age. Plus, the administration realized a major trade goal by working to have China accepted into the World Trade Organization, which enabled American goods to be sold on the Chinese markets.                   These just included summaries of each of the years that Clinton was in office. Look how much he and his administration accomplished; a lot. I believe he was one of the best presidents the United States has ever had. The only reason the scandals such as: Paula Jones, White Water, and Monica Lewinsky ever got out on Clinton was due to other people’s political agenda. Also during Clinton’s presidency, Rush Limbaugh made his radio talk show popular by putting Clinton down, which later, other copy cats followed. But it didn’t work up to their advantage. Since he didn’t get impeached and served out his term. But when you have a president that has not only accomplished many things in his own country, as well as internationally. People are going to get upset because President Clinton is doing so well; he is doing better than others. That is why when he left office in 2000, he had an approval rating of 65%.  Next time when you might judge Former President Bill Clinton, remember all the good he accomplished in his presidency, and what he did for our country. Now, look who’s president and see how we are in a recession and at war. At this time ask yourself who was the better president?                  In conclusion, during the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed more peace and economic well being that at any other time in history. He was the first democratic president to serve a second term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. During his terms in office, the U.S. had the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the highest home ownership in the country’s history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare. He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and also achieved a budget surplus. Finally, as a plan to celebrate the millennium in 2000, Clinton called for a great national motivation to end racial discrimination. This is why I believe Bill Clinton is a true world leader.
