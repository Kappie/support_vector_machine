Although I agree to some extent with what Max said, there was still a fair amount of child abuse going on, it just wasn't 'done' to publicise it. For example Myra Hindley, the Moors Murders, the West murders, the kid who was abused and then hung from a tree in Reigate..... there were numerous notorious child abusers/murders. I think it can't have been so easy to get guns 20 or 30 years ago, I think a lot of the guns nowadays are imported cheaply and illegally from America. Hence tighter import checks and better security, and higher penalties for being caught. I don't like the idea of air marshals. Ok, perhaps it may stop loonies from trying to hijack a flight, but why sholud they get them just on trans-atlantic flights? I would have thought that there would be a much higher risk coming from flights from the middle east to Britain and from the middle east to the USA. Without being rascist (although it's going to sound it), most of the terrorists are 'freedom fighters' etc from Muslim and Arab countries. I understand that you can't put air marshals on their flights because they are Arab airlines (not British and American ones), but I really do not think it is anything to do with flights from Britain. What I want to know is,  who is paying for these air marshals- us, the British tax-payers; or the Americans, who are the ones who are so up-tight about it anyway?  I woudl lay my money on it being us who has to fork out for it. But there we go again, me getting back to how Blair has become Bush's lap-dog. Absolutley disgusting that one man can just do what he wants at will with a country.  My final moan for the day on the point of guns. It's not directly related, but I think it needs to be said.  I personally believe that capital punishment should be brought back. People like Ian Huntley do not deserve to live. Ok, God said "Thou shalt not kill", but surely that works both ways- we shouldn't kill him, but he sholudn't have killed in the first place? But look back to the old testament- "An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"- surely this suggests that he should get what's coming to him? More and more British citizens are being imprisoned, and half the time they aren't even British citizens! This pushes up the price of keeping prisoners all the time, and like all the other good things in life, the money spent on the prisons by the good old British governemtn has to come from the tax payers. It would be a darn site cheaper to execute them. No mess, no hassle, no money, no protests about them being allowed to go on hunger strike, not giving them the safety of being locked up so they can't be mobbed for their heinous crimes, not giving them the chance to take their own lives and become 'martyrs' for other criminals of their types. Numerous states in America still use capital punishment, so why can't we? I believe that would be the answer. We should become a more agressive state in our policing policies- more police, more security for them, more severe punishment. Not just 'life sentences' that turn into 10 years behind bars because the culprit has 'reformed' or is let out on 'good behaviour'. If they're sick enough to commit a crime in the first place, then that violent/sadistic/homicidal/perverted/abusive tendancy is always going to be there.  Think that's all i wanted to have a moan about.
