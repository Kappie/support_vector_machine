I was kind of freaked out to ask my chem teacher about a couple questions from the homework but I did and she was actually really nice to me.  And well not to mention that we had the most interesting Chem class ever and it wasn't boring at all and I kind of understand the stuff.  Chem was fun today!  Although I was trying to copy down notes and like the over head is my way and same with the teacher and like I think she DOES realize she is in my way but she contines to stand there.  I swear she does that just to tic my off!  LOL.  So yeah that was basically my dad and well today me and Travis actually connected.  We started talking and well it felt right.  I found out he has a hot tub too and well that is like MY BIGGEST romantic fantasy ever - to be in a hot tub with a guy!!!  Wait a minute that will be more like reality soon!!  So yeah that was my day and well I guess I should get going on my homework now.  I was just listening to this song...and I love these lines of it.      Looking back now, itâ€™s so clear to me That you were sent to shape my destiny Because there were times when I was ready to walk away But you gave me strength to face another day  ~Ryan Malcolm (Something more)
