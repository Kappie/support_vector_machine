       
      Christmas has come and gone, and now the real depression sets in.  I must confess that New Year's Eve is probably my least favorite day of the year.  And every year when Christmas is over, I start to prepare myself for the year end specials that remind us how quickly time passes and how much from the previous year we could actually forget had happened until we are reminded by the cable news channels.  I usually try to occupy my time that evening somehow, which is hard for someone like me, who isn't into drinking or partying.  But as long as the sickies have the hold of me, perhaps I can just sleep through it all.
