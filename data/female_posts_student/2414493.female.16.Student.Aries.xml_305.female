But tallying everything up, I've spent 17 weeks my whole entire life away from home, away from the family. It shouldn't be that bad...that's about 4 months.  Someone else in Pennypacker also has Room on Fire and was playing it as I was sitting outside on the phone last night. Yay. I have random songs stuck in my head every so often.  I keep on looking in the mirror and swearing that I don't look awake.  But I am. And now that I am, I've had some time to reflect on things as they are. It's just so weird. I guess deep down I  was  expecting him to come, and now that he's not going to be here anytime soon, it's kind of weird. I wouldn't say that his not coming leaves a void, but still. I feel like I've almost been cheated out of something. That expectation, at least. I know it was really too much to ask for him to come all the way over here, on standby flights, and just give him a hell of a time trying to catch a plane, and I guess it's better that he knew last night that he couldn't make it instead of being at the airport right now and discovering that a trip to Boston wasn't a possibility. But it would have been something monumental if he showed up. Something to talk about for a long time after.  "I'm not your friend, I never was." -- Automatic Stop.  Oh, how I love that song. I'm playing it as loud as I can without disturbing anyone.  Ishita's going home today, and Sarah's going home next weekend. Maybe all I can say is that I'm glad that I don't have to go home...it would be so weird seeing everyone and then not. It's like tempting you to rush to the end, and I don't want to have to do that.  "Give me some time, I just need a little time." -- You Talk Way Too Much   Someone's playing the Schumann tomorrow night in a concert. The Brahms Society Orchestra. I should go, shouldn't I?
