Incest, murder, adultery, suicidal gestures – the story alone would keep us entertained.  Many marveled at the size of the orchestra; my old horn teacher was playing 8th horn so I was pleased about that.  As the house lights dimmed, we were asked to rise for the arrival of the Governor General, Adrienne Clarkson.  I was mildly amused that mostly everyone applauded for her, and although I couldn’t see her from my seat perched high above the orchestra level seating, I was later told she entered just like the Queen would have done – graceful, with a flip of her hand and with a large entourage.   The orchestra quickly plunged into  O Canada  and to my surprise again, mostly everyone began to sing so I joined in.  Afterwards, without hesitation Richard Bradshaw jumped into the overture and the opera was underway.  I was nervous about Acts II and III after seeing Act I.  As the opera opened, the lighting was dark, desolate.  The characters moved only slightly while singing their lines.   The tree in which Nothung is placed was broken off at the stump in three parts, lying in the centre of the stage, surrounded by dirt.  They did use a ‘real’ fire in Hunding’s house which was impressive, but that was the only visual highlight.   During all the dialogue, several people around me were drifting off to sleep, and I will admit I was one of them.  At least two people around me were snoring loudly.  Not a great way to start.   By the end of the act, though, there were some promising signs; the lighting brightened up and most of us who were nodding (literally) off to sleep became interested again.  Many people who were not familiar with the story were commenting during the first intermission about finding the incestuous relationship between Sieglinde and Siegmund very creepy.   I wonder if they didn’t have surtitles banging away the story if they would even realize what was going on?  Act II was a major improvement.  Even though the Fricka/Wotan confrontation is purported to be one of the driest sections of the Ring cycle, there were so many visual aspects to keep the audience’s interest that the sleeping problem in the first act was resolved for most of the audience.  The scene looked like a dance studio or acting studio with big square ceramic tiles, many of which were heaved up and in disarray around the centre of the stage.  There was dirt where the tiles should have been and Wotan was digging a grave here while Fricka, yapping away, ordered him to kill his son.  There were also roughly sixteen corpses wrapped in white shrouds laying all around the stage.   Along the top and sides of the scene, there were catwalks falling down (used by the Valkyries to cart in corpses) and big, working track lighting with spotlights on them, which appeared as if they had fallen from the ceiling. (These spotlights were dimmed and raised depending on the scene throughout the rest of the opera).   So, Fricka yells, Wotan digs.  The audience suddenly becomes aware of the corpse in front of him who blends in so well with the dirt and who is not covered in a shroud; this man is in a fetal position with both of his hands covering his eyes as if he died from fear, covering his eyes from something horrible.  (All the designer, Michael Levine, would reveal is that this is an Industrial Age set and something terrible has happened, but the audience won’t know exactly what happened until  Götterdämmerung  in 2006.)  The scene changes to the forest (just dimmed lighting with that big tree that never goes away) where Sieglinde tells Siegmund her premonition – he must die.  Enter Brünnhilde, carrying a white shroud for Siegmund.  This was a deliciously morbid moment when you realize why she’s carrying the shroud; it’s the same type as the other corpses are wrapped in.  Finally she unrolls the shroud and stands on the tree trunk and a flickering fire image (thanks to the stage design crew at the back of the auditorium) is emblazoned on the sheet (used like a screen projector).  VERY cool (except the flame image got stuck a couple of times, which was a bit disconcerting, but I’m sure they’ll fix it sooner or later.)  Brünnhilde holds this sheet up the whole time that she tells Siegmund he has to come to Valhalla until he refuses and rips the sheet out of her hand.  Of course, the scene ends with Wotan having to kill Siegmund and being mighty ticked off about it.   Finally, Act III was fabulous.  Everyone was anticipating the Ride of the Valkyries.  The Valkyries, as was previewed in the second act, now had at least 50 shrouded corpses and many more shrouded corpses were carried in along the catwalk and some dropped down from the ceiling on ropes while Valkyries below got them down and sorted them into piles.  Again, there’s no other way to say it except it was deliciously morbid.  A few kinks need to be worked out though; two Valkyries dropped one of the corpses who came from the ceiling on its head and couldn’t get the rope off from around its neck, and kept smashing its head onto the floor trying to free it from the rope.  (Fortunately the corpses were dummies and not real people…)  On the far right of the stage, one of the corpses was dropped and its head rolled off.  My guess is he won’t make the best guard ever for Valhalla without his head… Otherwise, a unique and interesting take on the infamous Ride scene.  They used some pyrotechnics at the end (fortunately not a cop out like Jürgen Flimm’s production in Bayreuth with the human microwave instead of fire…); the Valkyries each carried out two torches and placed them in the floor in a circle around Brünnhilde.  The direction by Atom Egoyan for Wotan during the fire scene was fabulous; he took off his outer coat and placed it over the sleeping Brünnhilde, and after he tenderly kissed away her godliness, he took off his under coat (leaving him in just a muscle shirt – I wasn’t too sure about that) and placed it under her head as a pillow.  Just a beautiful, touching scene with a father who is so reluctant to have to punish his beloved daughter like this.  Too many directors leave Wotan mad at her and have him storm off angrily, but this version made him more ‘human’, emotional and accessible.    The orchestra was in good shape.  One of the cornets was having some consistent difficulty hitting the right notes and the principal horn, trombone and clarinet each had some pitch/note problems at various solo entries, but overall they were powerful, accurate and endured throughout the whole four and a half hours quite well.  The singers were overall good.  It was nice to have some Canadian talent up there, especially Frances Ginzer as Brünnhilde.  She was so beautiful and had such a powerful voice the orchestra couldn’t cover her voice even in the low register.  The same can’t be said for Wotan and Fricka, whose performances I found disappointing.  Wotan did not look like a demi-god and that somewhat detracted from his performance; he looked more like a cross between John Malkovich and Randy “Macho Man” Savage (from WWE Wrestling) instead of a powerful, dignified god. Sieglinde and Siegmund were decent, as were the Valkyries.  Nice costuming as well (except that muscle shirt…)  I shall be interested to see what the inevitable review in the Toronto Star will say tomorrow, but in my humble and somewhat biased opinion, despite a few minor issues to work out, the production staff, cast and crew ought to be very proud of themselves for a job very well done.  They took on a Herculean task, did not back down, and left the audience eagerly awaiting the next installment one year from now.  Bravissimo.
