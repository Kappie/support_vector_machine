But two of my uncles brought girlfriends, and one of the girlfriends had to kids -- two boys, 11 and either 4 1/2 or 6. We're not actually sure how old this kid is; he says he's 4 and a half, but his mom said she had the kid when she was 38, and now she's 44... so anyways. Someone is lying ^^;;   So anyways, here's what I've decided: when we're all old and in our own houses, we all have to buy some big house and go there all together for the holidays. Families and everything. It is just soo much fun to have so many people together! I mean, it's craziness, but it is sooo fun! This year 19 (or something like that) people came over, and the only hard part is having to clean up when they're all gone.   Also, I am slightly bloated on chocolate. And my tummy hurts not because of candy, but because A is hilarious and I love her very very much. What would we do without our crazy musical A? I'm actually talking about both of them; A is back from Scotland and A wrote a WOWIE-hilarious blog earlier today. Either way, I am immensely pleased. Life is good.   I had my pia-no lesson today, and it was fun and interesting. My exam (aiee!) is on June 29th, long after our school exams, but still, I'm worried. Strangely enough I'm not actually worried enough to  practice , but that's fine. I'm sure I'll get bonus marks for grovelling. Nah, actually, I'm just a terrible procrastinator. Just watch, by June 28th my fingers will be stumps.   What else, what else... basically nothing. But I'm still looking for that fifth mini-site. I really, really want to add in a fifth link there *g* So if somebody doesn't comment / do the poll / call me / mail me / write it with lipstick on my mirror, I am going to go in some maniacal kill-all frenzy and you'll all be sorry. Or maybe I will anyways, muahaha.. ^^; I jest, I jest! Relax. Don't fall off your chair, jeez, it makes you look immature and dorky... man, you guys...   *falls off chair*
