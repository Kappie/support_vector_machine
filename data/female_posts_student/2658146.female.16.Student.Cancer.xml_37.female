I burned myself countless times setting off "Cannons," which was fun since my bro thought I couldn't set off two at once and I DID and it was SWEET!  Anyone ever notice that the 4th of July is a week long?  Other than that, I didn't really enjoy these past four days. Dealing with Lane and Dave and  especially  Brett really takes it out of ya (he's still pestering me for shit!).  Talking with a few friends of mine I've noticed how much other countries are better than this one. I really want to move to Norway a lot now.  Not much else to blog. My life is getting boringer.  Grammar is for wussies!   Current Mood:  Not really sure
