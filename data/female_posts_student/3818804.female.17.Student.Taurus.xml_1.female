She was doing this to tell me it was time for dinner. However, I was not nearly dressed to walk across the house, so I opened the door and asked my mother "Can someone please feed the dogs?" She asked me why I didn't and I told her I had just gotten out of the shower. Then she mumbled something I didn't hear because I was shutting the door. She was just sitting there watching t.v. I mean you can't just get up and walk your fat arse ten steps for the dogs. A chore that takes like a minute to do...  WHATEVER!  That was only like one of the ten things that pissed me off.  Today was my sisters 20th birthday. Sam was here this weekend of course, just like everyother weekend. They went to ride horses at Huntington Beach and then they or rather Sam went boogie boarding. Then after they came home we all went out for dinner, The whole familia. We got some serious grub on. yea yea. yummay! When we were going to order our food the waitress lady asked my mom if my sister and I were her daughters and then she said that I didn't look like her daughter (my mothers) and etc. etc. I thought it was so nice of her to say that I didn't look like my mom's daughter. I just thought it was so nice how a stranger could make you feel so warm inside with her stupid comments.  I'm going to the beach tomorrow. Newport baby! Come with me, call me up ;)  You learn something new everyday...Today I learned that the rocks leading out to the beach is called a jetty.  P.S. Get up offa that floor, Shake it, you'll feel betta'. Get up offa that floor, you gotta release that press-sha!
