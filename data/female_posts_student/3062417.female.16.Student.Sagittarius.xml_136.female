No fireworks, no picnic, no tubing, no sunburns (lol). It's just weird. I guess a lot of things will be changing soon, this is just the start.  Tomorrow I'm starting running for field hockey (I think) and maybe going to get more shorts. Anyone want to go running with me? Tuesday summer league starts. I'm so excited. What was I thinking when I almost didn't sign up for field hockey this year?  Listening to: [Cadillac by Mest]  [VERSE:] It's Friday night What's going on tonight I'll see her later on tonight  But now it's time to roll This somber state is getting old Well I never do what I am told So now we're gonna roll And now we're gonna roll  [CHORUS:] With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac  [VERSE:] We order another round My girl's nowhere to be found I hope she gets here soon before I'm fallin' down  Cause now I'm all torn up I feel like I might throw up Then I get word my girl's showin' up So now I'm gonna roll And now I'm gonna roll  [CHORUS:] With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Rollin' With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Self control knowing right from wrong is what I lack Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac  [BREAK:] Top down seat back wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back wi wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back top down seat back top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac  Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back wi wi wi wi with the  Top down seat back seat back seat back With the top down seat back wi wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back top down seat back  [CHORUS:] Rollin' With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Self control knowing right from wrong is what I lack Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac
