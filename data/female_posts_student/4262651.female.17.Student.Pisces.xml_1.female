This was complete and total hell because I ended up having to go to the doctor, and have my large bump cut w/ a mini scalpel,...joy...During the summer @ UDA camp, which I guess can count as practice for this post..lol.., I was scratched by morgan which was ok, b/c of course she didn't mean it. Then Hey! I get another infection on my elbow, which is why I have been wearing a large band aid to school. Those infection thingys coming both from the practice area in the south mall at ellender being disgusting and dirty! Oh, then Katie accidently scratches me on my eyelid! I swear someone doesn't like me...   What have I ever done to deserve these things   ...lamo! hehe
