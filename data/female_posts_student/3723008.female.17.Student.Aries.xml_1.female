Religion intrigues me and I think Catholicism is fascinating.. I love it.. And I realised that I love something else.. My brother. He can be a stupid, ignorant, inconsiderate jackass when he wants to be, but he's kinda nice to be around... I almost cried when I saw him walking in today... :(.. shh.. thats a secret.. ok.. on to the good stuff.. KIMBERLY LOOKED SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Very soon, I shall have pics, tomorrow actually, but I'll hafta go to the cafe n scan em etc.. so until then I will not share my wealth, I will gape at her by myself... OOOO and Ryan Ali was there today also..... for a smallie... WOW... I won't mind taking a bite outta that cookie.... that devon biscuit.... and there was this other tallish fairish dude... helllloooo nice sando BOYS!.. I hafta go down there for mass one day.. just to gape... after I make my trip to Couva and my beloved Fr. Spence.. he was such a cool man, such a nice man to hug.... *sniff*.. I  miss my Fr. Spence... The Archbishop celebrated mass, it wasnt exactly what I expected, he was a bit boring, but I guess he had to say stuff in relation to confirming faith etc...     Recedite, plebes! Stand aside, little people!..
