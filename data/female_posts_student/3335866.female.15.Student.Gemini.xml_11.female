Going back on the blog has made me kind of hyper, and I've re-read all my posts twice already. It seems that it'd be more productive to just write something so I can start crossing stuff off my to-blog-about list.   I've changed my profile around a bit, and the new picture is the  Buffy  poster I was talking about. Y'all like? I wish there was an English word that signified the plural of you. I guess I'll have to resort to French:  Vous  like? That's better. I'm just rambling. I'm tired. Something I didn't clarify in my last post- Natalia is my other best friend. I met her in 3rd grade and Henna in 6th. I'm not going to get into the merits of one versus the other- that's just a minefield of Don't Go There. I do put some value on my life after all.   I'm supposed to go to this "tea party" tomorrow. I put tea party in quotation marks because I don't know if any teenagers besides me actually like tea, so I doubt any tea'll actually be drunk. Sugar-addicted losers. Ha- I sound so jaded and cynical. Or not. The party's going to be crowded with people I don't know or don't like (or both) and the person who's holding it (Emma) is a friend of Natalia's that I can't figure out. I mean, I know I dislike her, but I can't figure out exactly why, or decide whether it's merited or not. It might be jealousy, or spite, or inadequacy, or the position of the stars. It also bugs me that it bugs me so much. I just don't like unreasonable dislike- it makes me feel petty. Back on topic- this same kind of party was held last year, and I didn't enjoy myself then either. It's really hard for me to talk to people I don't trust, so I basically latched on to Natalia when I wasn't standing apart from everyone else staring at trees or grass or sky. Why am I even going to this thing? When it was first mentioned to me I was moderately psyched, but I suspect that I was riding a hormonal high. Now I'm kind of dreading tomorrow. I know the food's going to suck.   Currently reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring  by J.R.R. Tolkien. I've never read this book before, if you can believe it. I've been trying to since elementary school, practically, and I think I've built up a mental block about it. Every time I've tried to read it I've managed to get to the part where Frodo sells his house and leaves, and then I drop it for something easier. By now I've read that part at least 7 times without getting any further, and every time I try to read it again I feel like I have to read that part, but when I do I get bored... It's just a vicious cycle. I think I'm beating it this time though; I'm getting through it pretty fast. This whole thing just kills me because I'm a book-a-holic. I love fantasy and description and poetry and nuance. This is exactly the sort of book I should adore; plus, it's quite embarrassing to have to admit that you've never read  The Lord of the Rings . Almost as embarrassing as not having seen  Star Wars , which is my other great shame. I have hope for this yet, though. It took my forever to get through  The Golden Compass , but I did it eventually, and the trilogy is now one of my favorites. I just have to suck it up and power through. On a side note, I've seen the movies, so I know how it ends. Way to steal my motivation, Peter Jackson!   Have you ( vous ) ever noticed how when a good book is discovered by someone else you like it less? I kind of think that's just me. I would adore  The Perks of Being A Wallflower  so much more if it had been my find, and I know if someone else had shown me  Where The Heart Is  I would've enjoyed it less. I suppose this is just me being stupid again. I can be incredibly possessive about the things I like. Just hearing that someone I dislike is listening to a CD makes me dislike it, and I never want to let my sister read my books. Let me slip into Freud mode... I suppose that I feel that my few strengths, the few things I'm secure in, are being threatened. I'm not sure about whether I'm 'good enough', but I know the things I like are worthy, and I feel like other people are stealing my merits. In my inexpert opinion, anyway.   I'm also reading some books in the Dollanganger series (by V.C. Andrews) and I'm skimming my  Song of the Lioness  books. I really feel starved for books right now. It'll be so good to get some new ones- at the moment my reading list includes  Please Don't Kill the Freshman ,  Lucky ,  The Basic Eight  and  Why Girls Are Weird . Lately I've been depending on blogs for reading material though. Some of them are as good as novels.  urlLink The Grub Report , for instance. I love nothing better than a good food description. ( Kitchen Confidential  by Anthony Bourdain is excellent for that.) Other good blogs include  urlLink About A Boy ,  urlLink Dancing Brave ,  urlLink pamie.com ,  urlLink Uncle Bob  and  urlLink Zoe Trope .   I'm going to quit now. I'm tired, and I'm neglecting baby-sitting duties. I haven't actually sat on Ian for over an hour. Plus I yelled at him. I suck. Goodbye.
