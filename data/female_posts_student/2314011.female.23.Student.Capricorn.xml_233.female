The weather was ahead of schedule, proving to be absolutely gorgeous all week, with a slight drop this morning.  But I would not be deterred.  Actually, it probably worked out for the best.  80 degree heat is really not the best to be trekking up and down steep forest floors, after all, and this particular trail always surprises me with its difficulty.  But I bought provisions yesterday and was determined not to get caught huffing and puffing without any trail mix!  And so, bright and early this (late) morning, I packed up my backpack full of water jugs, snacks, Superman notebook, Harry Potter novel and down the road I went.    Outran the rainclouds just fast enough to enjoy a lovely little meander to the falls, enjoyed a full 20 minutes of warm/hot sunshine and made it through a full chapter of The Chamber of Secrets before the rain started.  Even managed to get a little Henry David action on the side, which I thought I'd share here.  It's really rough around the edges, but it works:   Hey kids!  Welcome to Elk River!  We're at the Upper Falls lookout at the moment and it looks as though the spring rains have been beneficial.  My other spot--the one I planned to spend the bulk of the time at--may well be under water, so I'm hanging out here a bit longer than I originally thought.  Brought the old automatic camera I found in the old boxes last weekend--hope the roll of film is properly loaded--can't really risk looking now can I?  Looks like the clouds I outran to get here are catching up.  Good thing I changed my top and brought along the jacket!    It's nice to be here today--just the thing to celebrate a full week of nightly yoga practices and to remember the day from last year.  Good ol' June 5th, I tell ya what!  A story just might come out of my nature wanderings by the end of the day, I just dunno!   Yea, I've been feeling that old familiar pang of creation the last little while.  It's pretty amorphous and no clear idea has taken shape just yet, but the new reading list and increased "pages" time have been helping.  But anyway, back to the day:   Alrighty, here we are at my favorite little spot.  Yes, the water has risen quite a bit.  The places Levi and I dangled our feet and talked about Queer As Folk are under water.  The sun is trying to conquer to overcast sky and it feels really good for a minute.  But then the clouds overcome it and it's a bit cooler again.  But that feels really good, too.  There's nothing like the smell of a river during the summer.  It would be a bit keener if it was warmer, but it's just right for right now.  Making do with rolling up the sleeves to get some sun on the upper-arms and shoulders.  Looks like the sun may be conducive for a bit, too.  Yay.    So glad the day is living up to the idea formed last week.  Was expecting the 75-80 degrees promised, but the mild day is much better.  So glad I brought provisions.    The birds are chatting it up now that the sun's out.  Already found a little souvenir for the day---little rock waiting on a bigger rock that fits my fingers perfectly.  This is so much fun.  Soon I'll make a little nest and read.  Looks like the cloud cover is reclaiming control.  But the skin got a bit of attention and is thankful.  Nature seems to have its own agenda for the day, so all I can do is follow it and smile.    And sure enough, an hour later, nature ushered me out of the canyon.  And all the yoga must really kicking in, in a cardiovascular kind of way, because really...this trek back to the parking lot usually kills me, and it was tough today, but not nearly as.  Yay.  We love physical fitness!  Came home to find out that Ronald Reagan was dead and that Joe and I could get new, sleek flip-phones for $15 each.    "They have the 'OK' button," he said, as though that told me anything.  "As long as they're the sleek silver ones I've been drooling over for months, I'm down." Should have it when I go to Boise in two weeks.  Yay!!  And Miss Q called, which was so nice.  She's having a fabulous time in DC, working with people who are finally of her caliber, doing the sort of progressive, social-change affecting work she's always wanted to do and starting yoga.  That's right.  YOGA, I said!  She sounds as genuinely happy and content as I've heard in too long a time.  She deserves every bit of joy that seems to be continuously heading her way.  Keep following those signs, sweetie.  They'll never let you down.    So yea, not a bad day, all in all.  Think I'll go open a Huckleberry beer, finish a book, start another and listen to the rain falling on my tree.    Summer rocks.
