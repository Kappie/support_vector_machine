I was going through a rough time then. I had found out my friend had been raped, I was on the verge of depression myself. I had a poor family life, and I was starting to see how corrupted the world could be. It was a lot for my 14 year old mind to take in. But I've changed, boy have I changed. I no longer care if I have a boyfriend, Jennifer and I are no longer friends, and I've just grown up, to put it as simply as possible. The biggest worries of my life when I was 14 are now not even on my mind. Which is how it should be. I'm now almost 17. even the thoughts I had, and the things I did LAST YEAR make no sense to me. I have no idea why i felt the way i did about certain things, and why I acted the way I did. It's not who I am, and I know that now. I guess it's like they say, you learn from your experiences, and become a better person in the process.
