Not a bad show, HOWEVER LONG it may have been,  it was done really well and I recommend it. Once again I was reminded and extremely annoyed at the unnatural amount of talent Enloe has in the peforming arts. Their orchestra rocked...it made me remember why I quit band. Twas a fun night.  SAT's this mornin, which meant waking up EARLY on a SATURDAY! Not just early but very early, like 6:30 early. Not cool.   Broughton is big, I had to ask for directions 3 times, it was really dirty, and I truly think there was no air conditioning. But on the bright side the test was fairly easy. Some of the vocab. got me, but I just kept waiting for the readings and math to get harder....and they didn't. Lots of people from RCHS there, lots and lots.   Then, pizza. I love I love NY pizza.    My dad and I also went to the Readers Corner on Hillsburough after the test... that store is really awesome. They had every book we had to read for English for half the price, and they had CD's for $1, yes ONE dollar.  I used to hate that place when I was little, it always kind of  freaked me out, I'm not really sure why...maybe it's because it kinda smelled. But I liked the smell today...old booky smell.
