I'm supposed to tell you something, but because I live in my own world and stuff we had to invite that thing.          Disclaimer: Very funny, Baka.          *pulls out scroll* Baka has asked this to be unprofessional so she wrote this herself.          Baka: Blah blah, yadda yadda, can we just get on with this?          Disclaimer: Quote: I do not own Yu-Yu Hakusho, that honor belongs to Yoshihiro Togashi. The only character that is mine is Daisuko Tokenkura and her parents and her enemies. End quote.          Baka: Are you done?          Disclaimer: Yes.          Baka: Good! Now get the hell outta here! *kicks Disclaimer out of door*          Kurama: Was that really necessary?          Baka: You all know my faithful sidekick. One of the four Spirit Detectives and reformed demon thief, Kurama!          *Kurama raises eyebrow*          Baka: Anyway, this story is kinda romantic, and very kick-ass. You are going to like this.          ***
