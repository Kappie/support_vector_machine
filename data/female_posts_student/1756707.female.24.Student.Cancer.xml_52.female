Archiving Communal authorship Blogs v. personal journals Links and hypertext - intertextuality Arrangement - organization - ordered complexity Audience - public/private Response -- comment tools What about audioblogger? How does that impact this media? Blogging as a motivated student activity - a literate practice they don't give up at the end of a semester History of blogs - who developed this? Where did it come from? How has it been taken up since?   I could go on for days, but I won't.  I'm so fascinated, on fire and shaking, with the possibilities of these questions.  Hannah, I think we have the beginnings here of some major serious research questions, some publishable stuff.  (But where? When? How?)
