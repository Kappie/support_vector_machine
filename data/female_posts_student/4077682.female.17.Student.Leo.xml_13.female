Today was SUCH a blah day, probably the worst yet this summer. But I guess that only leaves room for improvment. :)  We did NOTHING. it was such blahness. But then I went to a musical with my parents. yes that is right. a musical. Im suuuch a sucker for musicals. I LOVE them. you can totally escape, such good music, acting, DANCING! It totally made me feel better. The one I was was "Crazy for You". It's the best one I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.  This year my school put on the musical "Hello Dolly!". That was sooo fun. Not only cuz I love stuff like that, but because soo many of my friends were in it. Also the part I had, was paired with another one. The girl who had that part is a good friend of mine. We hadn't had a lot of time to see each other, so it was really fun to hang out so much doing things we both love.       It always seems so sad how you can drift apart from people. I have an awsome group of friends that I hang out with almost everyday. I also just had my best school year so far, adn this is the best summer EVER! But to gain stuff, you have to lose stuff. There's a lot of people I have been losing touch with, and I also rarely have "me time".... last summer was really fun, but it was more chill. hmmm. But I guess I like it better busy...
