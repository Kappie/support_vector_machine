It's the memories that always hold you back from moving on  accepting the present. It's the good ones that equip you with a *false* hope  *wishful* thinking. It's the bad ones that you remember the most.   oh shush.  I had the chance to catch up with a few people. Kristine made me eat peanut butter. Grace: Its called..lovee! awwhhh *tear she's growing up. Ian: you'll be okies ;) Even though you may be giving up..I am not.  It was juss really weird last night. An emotional rollercoaster ride perhaps? I had a chat to Gez - who is leaving me for Melbourne! Ian left today. Coleen's leaving on thursday! Let me mention what I felt last night talking to various people. Anger, sorrow, happiness, pity, *kilegs* hahaha, regret, *tear, joy, excitement  drive. All last night. Am I not making sense? Yeah thought so.  It doesn't make sense cause I can't blog everything right now. Im sorry! I will update you as soon as I can!  -- kickin' it --
