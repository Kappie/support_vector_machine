Tonight, though, I have been working on Spanish notes trying to get ready for the new semster. Only a few more days!       I had a scare tonight. Mike IM'd me and told me that Dennis had been in an accident. Scared the shit out of me. He's ok, and the truck is still drivable. I got to talk to him briefly but I am not sure about what really happened.        it's about time for me to go home. More later.
