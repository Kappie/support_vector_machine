I'm failing math now. You guys promise me you'll help me. But do you? No no one ever does. If I go in early to Mrs. Austin she teaches me whole new crap and I don't understand. I'm giving it my all to understand but its just so hard. Your probably wondering why I'm still here if I'm bitching...well some people actually make me feel like I should live. I thank God I have those people in my life everyday. Without friends I'd be dead. I don't think there was anything good about today at all. I hope tomorrow is better.
