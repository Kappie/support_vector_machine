I'm hungry but I would have to fix anything that I want to eat.    Not much is going on besides school and work.  Three weeks until my last day.  I can't believe it.  I hate to use this cliche but it seems like I started at the Building Commission yesterday.  I have never had a better job in my life.  I love the people I work with, I love what I do...  I have a lot of fun with them all.  I am going to miss them so much.  I am so glad mom helped with the laundry today; it helped so much.  I will be able to get more stuff done tomorrow since I won't have to take time out for that.  I study while I'm at the laundromat but it's all the getting stuff together, going to the ATM, going to the laundromat, loading four separate washers and dryers and folding it all then driving back home and getting it out of the car and bringing it in and folding it..  That's what takes so much time.    I'm hungry.
