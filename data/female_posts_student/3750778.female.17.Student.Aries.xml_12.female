And I'm so lonely..*sigh*.. oh well at least I have Rick...hmm well whatever...aha. If you can't tell I'm posting for postings sake. I really have nothing to say once again. That's the thing about summer in Anniston, nothing really ever happens. At least I get to go to Branded by Fire! It is the most awsome youth conference ever!! And God is actually there! And we get to dance and scream and just be happy! OOO I can't wait! I want to go and get my heart changed! I hope it is 10 times better than last year!! hmm ok ahaha enough of my hoping, I need to go do something...
