To pass the time alone in an office in which I don’t normally work, I have been googling variations of my name.  I am not nearly as pervasive of a presence on the internet as I would like to be.  In fact, one of the top responses for my name is actually one of those “meet the Raiders” pages from when my stepbrother played football at Tech, and I’m listed as “sister of the lineman”.  Which is pretty cool, but not as cool as actually having your own listing.  The ubiquitous Joe Randa, 3rd baseman for the Kansas City Royals, was prevalent in my searches, as always.  I’ve been a follower of his since high school, when I spotted his surname during a KC-Rangers matchup.  He’s a better-than-average player, not exactly Ken Griffey, Jr., but has a decent bat, solid fielding.  So I enjoy sharing a name with him.    I also discovered  urlLink Randa Corp.,  the world’s leader in men’s accessories.  Randa's many innovations and technological developments as a neckwear company include being the first American company to open offshore manufacturing, in Puerto Rico, 1964 as well as being the first American company to open a manufacturing facility in Europe, Gino Pompeii, 1969.  Apparently, Randa Corp. is also an expert in merging with companies that have nothing to do with men’s accessories, as evidenced by their “other products” listings: “Our brand portfolio includes such names as Dockers, Geoffrey Beene, Slates and Van Heusen.  We also exclusively market a vast variety of novelty brands such as American Greetings, The Beatles, Endangered Species, Tabasco and Save the Children.”  What the Beatles have in common with Tabasco Sauce and Dockers is beyond me, other than profits.  That’s why I’m not in the business school.    I also found a new baseball player with whom I share a name, not as accomplished as Joe Randa but also pretty young, named Justin Randa.  He plays at—you guessed it—Barton County Community College in Kansas.  He’s a lefty with a 2-3 record, ERA kind of stinks but not a bad batting average, .283.  I wonder if he’s related to Joe.    So, I really need something to do today.  I’ve even stooped so low as to read Ann Coulter’s  urlLink latest pile of op/ed crap , in which she compares trial lawyers to strippers and insinuates that John Edwards likes to kill unborn children for entertainment, with the help of their “liberal mothers.”  Christ.
