So how many times have you herd some one say, "she's such a poser" "she doesn't even play guitar" "she thinks she's punk".. Yeah let me say this "bullshit" and yes, I'm talking about avril lavigne. And I would also like to say, what the hell are you people talking about? Your not up there singing to thousands of people, doing what she loves the most in life as her career! You don't know what its like to be in her shoes, she's who she is! And same goes to all the other so called "poser" artists out there. They worked hard to be where they are now and the last thing we should do is cut them down for making their dreams come true. How about take a look at yourself, and she where you have gone in life? Have you made any of your dreams come true? Or are u too busy analyzing those who have?   P.S. And about the hole, not playing guitars... Id like to inform u that AC/DC's lead singer.. Doesn't play guitar  OMG POSER RIGHT!?!?! Yeah, I don't think so.
