So if you have time, pray for the affected families and for Sarah. Now, it's weird because he wasn't mentioned in the obituary, but his other sister Samantha is...so I'm confused man...but oh well. I guess that's all I have to say about that. I am at a loss for words and just in shock since we're like tight...like margerine. Note to self: Call on Thursday. GIVE IT A FEW DAYS
