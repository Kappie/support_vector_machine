So my mom, sister, me, and Courtney went to go play tennis on the high school tennis courts. We got out, played for a little while, and then decided it was too windy so we went to get back in the car, and found out: it was Locked!!!!! Yes, we locked ourselves out of our brand new car. So, when we realised that our cell phones, purses, and Courtney's homework were in my mom's car, we started wondering what we were going to do. We decided we would walk back to Courtney's house and use her phone to call Randy Witte, who's dealership we bought the car from.  Then we walked all the way back to the tennis courts. Words can't describe how funny we probably looked: Walking through Karnes City with a tennis racket and four people. Well... So we got back to the courts and sat around our car. Finally Randy shows up with this police officer (that Courtney knew, by the way). The police officer spends about 1/2 an hour sticking a long metal stick into my mom's car- but he couldn't get it. Yah, he wasn't all that great. Courtney, Elise, and I got cold so we decided to go sit in Randy's car (that he brought us). Let me tell you about this car.... lol. It was a big black, suburban. And it was old. I think it was an '80s or '70s model. It was.... hilarious. There were all these metal poles on the inside that we think came off of the outside of the car. It was a hooptie or however u spell it lol (i'm laughing my ass off right now) Anyhow, we finally have to call the wrecker service, and yes, the policeman is still trying (it's been, an hour? lol). The wrecker man comes, and does it in 5 minutes. Poor cop. His face was so red. So then, wow, we had our car back. We spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out how we'd locked ourselves out- we still don't really know. I think it's because we had set off the burglar alarm like 1/2 an hour before.... I dunno. We still don't know, like I said. So then we decided to go to Dairy Queen to eat. We went tothe one in Kenedy, for some reason, but we got inside and found out- they didn't take checks! As we were about to leave Dairy Queen this old man stopped my mom and asked us if we came from Kansas.... My mom told us she didn't want us near him so she told us to go to Pizza Hut while she like plowed it out of there lol. So we ran across the parking lot and we got to a ditch, where Courtney tripped. OF course, according to our luck, there were TABLES of hot baseball players staring at us as we ran and tripped from inside Pizza Hut. So we finally get to Pizza Hut, and start eating, lol. If you don't know, Courtney and I have a thing for Britney Spears (her MUSIC lol, yah her boobs are fake so we're not jealous lol jk ppl). So we tried to make the jukebox play Oops... I Did It Again. It wasn't loud at all, so we went up to the front desk and requested that they turn it up. Very embarrassing, but I swear they spiked the pizza, lol. So they turned it up all the way, and we put in a couple of dollars. And told the jukebox to replay the same song (Oops... I Did It Again) over and over again lol. We hit the button and it started out really loud, u know how it sounds, with the bass? lol. So we acted like idiots and ran back to our chair really fast. We looked pretty stupid I guess.  So we were sitting there eating while people were laughing at the choice of song and looking at us saying "Look at the blondes who picked BRitney Spears." IT was even more hilarious when the song kept repeating and people were like, "OMG, here we go again." But the BEST part was when we saw this guy who had been playing baseball sitting at a table with all his team mates- DANCING. lol. It was SO FUNNY, he was getting all into it, dancing while he was sitting there. We were dying of laughter. So, as we left I gave Courtney a penny and she went over to this guy at his table and goes "I like your dance moves", puts the penny down, and we left. His whole table was laughing their asses off, including the coaches, and the poor guy was all red. Let's just say- we know how to have fun. But it is kinda sad that we locked ourselves out of our car on the first day...  Luv u all 4 Eva, ~*Philly*~
