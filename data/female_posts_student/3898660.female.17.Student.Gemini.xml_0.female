Dun feel good right? so am i. i'm human either. i have feelings too. some more its on the spot and right infront of me. she started things first ok? i din reply her msg and deleted her from friendster doesn't mean i'm finding trouble right? Lester told his ex that i dun like her cos of the incident during the first outting. she blogged and she said lester is a whimp. Eh! u can say me but not anyone who close to me. yesh, i'm sensitive and so? that's my characters so wad u wan me to do? change it? if i change it, i'm no more priscilla toh pls. u blogged first and of cos i wrote stuffs at friendster as i know that u will view my profile for sure. my friend did left me a testimonial and i do admit for wad she wrote was pretty mean and sound unpleasant to u. let me repeat again, i'm not stopping lester to contact u nor chat with u. it's his own wish and he doesn't wanna chat with u, does that concern me? i doubt so.
