Only a few people will be in the audience... so come and laugh at us... :)   To Kill A Mockingbird  auditions were today...  I was in the last group to audition.... ...Claire ended rehearsal at 4ish... so I had to wait for over 2 hours to do a cold reading of a short monologue. Bah...  I doubt I'm going to get a part... Not that I really want one (I didn't sign up to do tech so I can be lazy this spring :)  ...But Claire said that there are 18 parts in  Mockingbird , so I guess there is a decent chance that I would get a part...  ...I'll know on Monday...  I went to stations of the cross at church tonight...  I'm kinda glad I did, just because I got to see Bekah (and Justino and Bekah's parents...) ...Just yesterday I was thinking about how we never see each other and hardly ever talk... :Also, I think she kind of made me say that I was going to church on Sunday...  Meh... Bekah, If I am able to pull myself away from wherever I fall asleep on Saturday night (er, early Sunday morning..), I  WILL  be at church... :)
