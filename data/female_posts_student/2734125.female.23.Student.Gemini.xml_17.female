I enjoy the idea that words hold power, that the utterances that we make may have been born of a universal communication that we have yet to discover.  Its shocking to think that all of our language is abitrary, that it is the regurgitation of generations of randomly firing synapses.  Cabalists beleive that in the numerology of language there is a hidden language of god. That the names of all things are traced back to their one essence and god spoke them into reality.  According to Aggripa, a magus in the 1500's who hated most of everything and was attempting to move beyond words, Eve means life, and Adam means earth.  This would mean that Eve was the creator, or at least, for Aggripa, that women deserved more respect then they got.  I was amazed to read that people have been talking discourse theory and magic and rhetoric every thing a "paradigm shift" occurs.  Interesting pattern to look at, think about.  I did homework all day, if you couldn't tell, and volunteered all weekend at a conference that was being held in town.  It was busy and focused.    When you shut your eyes do you ever discover that you no longer can hold onto any sense of size?  This happens to me occationally, and I will close my eyes and be huge, far beyond the bounds that I know my flesh makes, or I will be so thin and streched, or a tiny dime sized dot.  To open my eyes dispels the feeling, but often I cant escape it once it begins in the blackness behind eyelids.  It will change, shifting in a lava lamp fashion between shapes, and sometimes it will be themed, all small or all large.  I can focus on one part of my body, like a toe or a finger, but then there is just a morphing with a bit more of a center.  I don't move locations, I am not out of my body, I am just in a strange and infinite space that occupied the same space as my body.  It is effected by temperature, but not as much as you would think.  For a while I thought that it occurred when I was at the exact temperature where you cease to feel, and you are floating.  I think it is around 80 degrees.  But then I found that wasn't the way it was.  Hot and cold in extreme seem to shock you out of it, but maybe it is more distracting.  Most often I will be laying on my back, but there have been exceptions.  There is no control.  I have tried to make my self large or small, one dimensional or multiple dimensions, but there doesn't seem to be any connection with thought.  It is not caused by stress or relaxation.  There is nothing I trace it to. There are times it is like water, and times it is like rain, and rarely it splits me in two or more.  Like an imagined fractal of my sprite body. Maybe it is a lack of some vitamin?  More salt in my diet?  A friend that I was expecting just pulled up across the street.  I will go greet him and put aside work for the night.
