I think I finally got to sleep at 5:00 am...yeah 5 in the fucking morning. I listened to The places you have come to fear the most like 6 times, I just kept replaying it and replaying it cause I was to lazy to get up and put in another CD. I have offically come to hate that CD and don't plan on listening to it for a while, I really did out play that last night.  Anyway..this morning I re-read my last blog entry and it kinda made me laugh, I was a little over dramatic wouldn't ya say... I'm sure things are fine, and if they aren't then me bitching about them isn't going to make life eaiser. One of the things I hate most about people is when they bitch about stuff that can't get better, but then I'm such a hypocrite cause I do it all the time. HaHa I hope people are actually gunna talk to me after that entry..oh well, we'll see I guess.   Other shit I wanted to talk about in my blog last night but other stuff seemed to come-up..Olivia told me last night that her and Phil are now dating. Hmm...I think it's weird, I'm glad for her and all , but when I look at Phil , I see a funny guy who makes everybody laugh, not a Mr.relationship, he seems really un-commited. I hope I'm wrong. I also hope that he'll treat Olivia good, not be an asshole and forget to call all the time, then get drunk on the weekends and make out with other girls. Cause Liv is to good for that type of thing , so hopefully he knows that going in to this. Cause if Phil hurts her well I believe I'll have to cut his dick off...(that was one for Liv haha) Another thing..so many people comlain about being single. I've been singel FOREVER and I seldomly complain about, I mean yeah once in a while I'll talk about it , but NOT EVERY SECOND do I complain about it non-stop. I mean come on people...  Today it's my dad's birthday..WOO! Let's all re-joice that the asshole is another year older.I don't like him. It really sucks.. the way me and him have been getting along latley. I used to have the best relationdship with my dad, he used to be sooo cool. I'd like to say it's cause of his new stupid slut of a girlfriend that we no longer have that relationship, but then I get the question...Why didn't it bother you with his other five girlfriends (yes I said other 5 ..meaning all 5 at one point movied in with us, IN OUR house) But this chic is diffrent , major bitch. I'd met her two times before she moved in with us this past Christmas eve, so yes she was there Christmas morning, I knew her only as a stranger. Not only was she a stranger in my home but on freaking Christmas, anyway..she thinks she's my mother and she has some obsurd idea that she can disipline and tell me what to do. If you know me, then you know I hate that type of shit. I don't even like it when my parents try to restrict my social plans (meaning the ground me ) so I'm sure you can imagine what it's like when she tried. The first couple months I kept my mouth shut, trying to make the situation work. But by mid March I couldn't take her shit anymore, She always had some smart ass comments to shoot at me. One night we were in the car and I asked my dad if after dinner he could take me to the mall because I needed some new pants. He was in a pissed off mood, and he said "I just gave your mom 400 dollars for child support", Now he meant it as I don't really have the money right now to take you shopping, even though I knew what he meant I commented back.."Dad you know that moneys not for me it's for paying bills that you USED to have to pay before you decided to move out" (I knew it'd piss him off, of course that's why I said it) But no Trish ignores the fact that I'm speaking to my dad about something that is NONE of her buisness and she chimes right in..."No your mom is wrong cause that money is for you, not her, she can't spend that personally, is your mom really that stupid." UMM OK BITCH..did you really just talk about my mom like that , are you fuckng retarded. We argued about it intill we pulled in the garage. She was still talking, but I just went in the house and slammed my bedroom door. I guess that night my dad felt bad because he never said anything to defend me even though he knew I was right and she had to buisness saying anything in the first place, so he took me to the mall. (yes I am a spoiled only child..hehe) And you can imagine that the Bitch was extra bitchy because of this. We got home and she immediately asked how much he spent on me..that was the first time I snaped , "Why the hell does it matter to you, I hate you and your ruining my life" ...DOOR SLAMS. HAHA yeah so this is the point where my dad totally takes her side and tells me if this is the way I'm going to act I'll have to move in with my mom for a while. The next day I got all my clothes and my mom came to pick me,I was carrying them all downstairs, and Trish stopped and said ..(these are her exact words..cause I still haven't forgot them)..Wow you really are a little spoiled ass brat, look at all those clothes, making you father spend his hard earned money on more...That's a shame your so shallow...I screamed FUCK YOU and left..to my suprise, my mom just smiled when I told her that...Yeah so that's the story of the reason I can't stand my father. Theres alot more but I've definitly already bored everyone with enough.  It's thursday and I have no plans...I hope I will end up having plans today..I thought I was supposed to , But I dunno..I hope to..anyway I'm gunna go for now...later
