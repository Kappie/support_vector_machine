I'm tired, but that's just a minor side effect. Told myself I wouldn't act like a shameless loser and go online at all, but here I am. I say that it's been an ok day, I might as well indulge.    In the process of getting rid of boredom, I have acquired yet another "Harvard crimson" shirt. I've been eyeing it for a while, though, so I say that justifies my splurging. I'm going to wear it the day of the history AP. Maybe. It's comfortable, I'm wearing it now with the tag on. I ponder the psychology of buying on sale. I like it better since it's spending less money, but I can imagine there are some blue bloods out there who would never stoop as low as picking something up from the sale racks. Maybe their reasoning is that once they wear it it'll be so obviously out of season already? I wouldn't know. But then again, retail stores need sales, and people to buy sale items. That's the only way they can clear off old clothing. Anyways. I like sales, and if it makes anything better I never saw this shirt in Abercrombie before, only online. And yeah, now I am obviously wandering into the territory of the disgustingly superficial. Moving on, shall we?  Grandma has acquired a taste in Orange Julius. One of the girls behind the counter reminded me of a girl on the Real World. (arr, so much pop culture has infiltrated into my observations. I guess that's what spring break does to you). She also said, "I almost wish I hadn't agreed to letting you skip a grade so you could stay around longer and drive me around." Prefaced with a "You'll laugh, but..."   K called on my birthday, and I think I remember saying I'd call him back the next day. I didn't, so he called today and left a message with Mom telling me to call after 7pm. So am I to feel like an ogre? He got into Cal, so that makes him and Abdul, at least. Except..wait, I don't know if Abdul's going to HMC. K's a neat kid, really. I just don't know what I'd say to him on the phone. Maybe it's just overthinking, I"ll just call him up.   After jello fish, though. Austin came into the media room/Lydia's den and conveyed some sense of boredom, so we hatched up a crazy plan to go to Vons and get jello and make a huge jello fish. So yeah. Now we also have four flavors of jello, instant pistachio pudding, and brownie mix in the pantry. We'll have to wait until dinner's over for use of the stove, though. It's going to be interesting, no less.   It's the last weekday of spring break. Maybe it's for the better, I had to take Tylenols to alleviate that boredom headache. Tomorrow's Colburn (and arranging rides first) and Sunday's playing piano with Andrew. AP Andrew, Ellis.  The housekeeper is ever intent on getting us all to the dinner table. Drives me nuts. I prefer the tactic of delay, but it starts getting on my nerves.
