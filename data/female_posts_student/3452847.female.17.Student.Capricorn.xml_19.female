I can't believe that he kissed me three times purely because i was there, or maybe i can? And he really is the player hes made out to be.. I totally understand about the band, and going to Brighton being the band and not being at rehersals, i like being there and seeing how they all just fit music wise and make something work. Its inspiring... Maybe hes just doing it because we fell out and he doesn't want me there... I still wish i'd never said a thing, and that Tom and Lianne hadn't said anything, i trusted them.. Hoped they wouldn't say anything, as i knew it wasn't going anywhere, and i liked him being nice, even if he wasn't going to live up expectations. I wish i could trust him, and like him, and believe him, makes me sad when i know i can't as i know i couldn't trust him properly. I know i need a new man to get my claws into, something fun and casual as i couldn't do anything serious yet. I feel too much, too young, and its wrong. I need to have some fun, i've got some goals for myself.  * I am going to get my belly button pierced and my ear.  * I am going to restyle and colour my hair. * I am going to start saving money for driving lessons as the more i go out  the more i get interested in it. * I am going to take my mind off Jason and try and concentrate on me and something else.  Think thats all, slightly more positive than the rest of my posts, i just know i'll never get my hopes up anymore, about anything, i have to resists, and live in hope the he does/did love me.   ~Lisa~
