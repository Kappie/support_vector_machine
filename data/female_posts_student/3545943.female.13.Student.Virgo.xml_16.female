As we reached the "One mile to Center Point" sign, the car began to slow.  My dad pulled onto the shoulder of the highway and the car continued to slow.  Finally, it came to a halt.  My dad got out of the car and checked the engine.  He tried to restart it several times, but we got nothing.  We got out to walk.  We had walked only ten feet when a car pulled over in front of us.  A man with rugged features and bristly stubble all over his chin got out of his truck and walked towards us.  His face was dirt-smudged but kindly.  He offered us the use of his cell phone and gave us a ride to Joensy's.  (And my mom said not to get into a car with a stranger!)  He told us that they had had a car that broke down once, and they took it in to fix, but it kept breaking down every so often for about six months, until they gave in and got rid of it.  He was awfully chatty.  He told us all about his wife and kids.  So here was this man we had never met before who stopped to help, just because we knew what we were going through.  That's kindness.    We ate our supper and called a friend of ours to come rescue us.  My dad waited for the tow truck, which would only tow the car five miles before charging, so they went to the auto repair shop near Center Point.  My mom and my sister went to fetch my dad.  Now the car is dead.  Our good ol' Hyundai that served us so well.  But that's what happens when you buy a used car, I guess.  Poor thing.
