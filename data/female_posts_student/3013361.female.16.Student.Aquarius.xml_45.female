Her name's Faith Elizabeth and she was born on June 11, she is so cute. And then Noah, he's getting so big (he'll be 2 in October) was being hysterical. Julie said that he doesn't like Faith getting more attention so he yells at her to stop. He yells "Baby! Stop it!" its so funny. And then he runs around and growls and throws things. He's hilarious. I might watch them tomorrow night. Who knows. Anyway, I'm about to get some shut eye.
