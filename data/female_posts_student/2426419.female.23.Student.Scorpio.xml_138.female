Then, just when you think you've gotten your answer, or at least enough to satisfy you for the moment, BOOM!  Then comes what you were waiting for.  I think it's funny the way that all happened, with J just driving home and suddenly there it was.  I think it's awesome that we now have a way to explain who we are and what we do.  I think it's hard to know exactly what all that looks like right now, but I also think that if we just chase after Jesus we don't really need to worry about that because we'll figure it out along the way.  I must say I love the phrase "Rhythm of God."  It just sounds so cool.  I am excited to see what happens in the weeks and months to come as we think and pray about what this statement means to us and for us as a community.  I think it will be an amazing time.
