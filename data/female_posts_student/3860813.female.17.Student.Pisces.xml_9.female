"umiiyak ako nung pinanganak ako..." haha.. i said that earlier this morning.. but to clarify things... what i really wanted to say was "kumakanta ako nung pinanganak ako.." (i was trying to explain why i'm always singing.. but that didn't help.. i just thought it'd sound funny if i say it.. haaaay.. oh well.. another one-liner down the drain...)    "lahat ng solusyon may problema"  haha.. i think that's true but that wasn't what i was trying to say.. malapit nang lumabas yung cheesy side ko nun.. but the clown in me interfered.. hehe.. sasabihin ko dapat "lahat ng problema may solusyon".. oh well.. still made my friend laugh without meaning to...     oh well.. i think my  brain's not functioning well right now.. i hope i didn't say anything stupid in this post.. nyahaha...    speaking of weird.. check this site out:  urlLink www.theweirdsite.com
