Probably the only project I've ever had fun doing.  Anyway, this weekend was ok. i decided to go to the band lock-in. It was alright I guess. A bit long but, not bad in the long run. I mostly hung out with Allyce, Brandon, Chris, Peter, etc.  Eh.  Saturday, I went out to lunch with Kathryn and Mary Clare and we walked downtown Naperville a bit. That was quite fun. Yummy. YaY Noodles. Then, I went to a cocktail party last night. that was fun. :) I didn't drink anything but it was still a lot of fun.   Nothing more to say really and I do need to get back to my project.
