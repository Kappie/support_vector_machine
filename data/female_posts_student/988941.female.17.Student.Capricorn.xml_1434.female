Past 2 days I have been mostly in textiles room helping to do the tye dying for the school play next week. Its pretty tiring but they need it done. next Wednesday I am doing the textiles stall for the induction days along with Megan and someone else, maybe Helen? Should be interesting and hey we get to dress up smartly!  Work today until 1.30 then going up to school to get T-shirts to bring home and finish off. Going to see Charlenes play tonight with Paul :). Working all day tomorrow.   What is everyone upto this weekend?
