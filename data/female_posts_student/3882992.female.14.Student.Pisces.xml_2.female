I stayed up till fivein the morning with my friend trying to figure it out andI can't -There is no happy ending for me and the fairytale for me has turned in to a horror movie.  I can't get over small things. People keep telling me that the small things don't count but when I add them all up I see what nobody else can see. I see a giant problem and the problem for me at the moment is living. I'm not trying to figure out the meaning of life--I'm trying to figure out the meaning of MY life. Also for some reason everytime I try to put the pieces back togeather it always falls apart a billion times worse again. It makes me frustrated and I tend to give up---all the time and I want to give up again-this time for good.  Maybe I just want to get away from the love I get that always seems to shatter or maybe I want to get away from all the people I know and all the things I do. I mean what's the point of living if everybody I love dies or leaves me. Love hurts, people die, friendships crumble, people move away, fights. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore. I don't care. I honestly feel like I have no reason to put myself through all this pain-I have too much of it to handle. I'm not a very open person either-i don't like it when people know howI fell about myself or about others-because I always get hurt in the end. There is honestly no reason to go on. Who do I have to live for? Nobody.Nothing. Nobody because all the people I have ever loved has left me or killed themselves or died.  Sure, people are going to try to tell me what I have to live for but I have finally figured what I have left to live for-nothing. Nothing because there is nothing out there for me. Nothing can help me or make me stop feeling emptiness. You could be in a room with 50 other people and still be alone. It's the most horrible feeling in the world. So now I refuse to stop loving-living and putting myself through a whole new world pain and suffering. I'm sick and tired of it all. I'm sick and tired of living this life and getting hurt. I'm sick and tired of loving somebody so much I would die for them and have them leave me. I'm sick and tired of fights and friendships I can't rebuild. I'm just sick and tired of living. So now for me...there's no reason.......and no hope.
