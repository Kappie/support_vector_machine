Oo might actually get her silver soon... must remember to give her STB... yesterday she convinced some daft maris stella guy that she was in interact club, and they do CIP by going online to chat... hilarious man... Went to her block today, spotty is sooooo naughty! He keeps dashing for the house to get Taro!! Poor Taro... Andre came over to practice Sunday's worship songs with dad in his army uniform... Had a new teacher in CAT. Am bored, which is why I took the trouble to blog this stuff... All crap really.
