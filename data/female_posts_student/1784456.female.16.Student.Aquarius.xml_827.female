We should do something tomorrow (god, how many times have I said that lately?) because we need to give Laura her pressies that we erm...haven't got... heh heh... And I have to get a pressie for Flynnie-poos! Might get one in France. Everythings cheaper overseas...shame I have no money. I think Laura's dead. I've been trying to phone her. Oh well.
