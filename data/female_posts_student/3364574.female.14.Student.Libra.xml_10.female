I wish this feeling would end. Yet, people see me happy, but only I pretend. Still, you call me on my phone, Hoping that I'm still home. It's not fair to me and you, I know that because it's true. You're trapped in your past, Not knowing when it will pass. Looking sad and depressed, Your life became a mess. So please, try to understand, Hoping we'll still stand. Let's call "it's quits" and make a deal. You don't have to accept the way I feel.
