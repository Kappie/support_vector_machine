I know it sucks I had to cancel like 2 dates with Rob, but one I did go to LA to spend his lunch hour with him.. that was nice. I really really REALLY like him, but he doesn't think so and I don't know how to tell him and make this up to him.. I mean, for Pete's Sake, I stopped swearing like a sailor for him, 95% of the time... (Sorry Paul and Tom).. 5% are accidents and usually moreso in my head! So I shake a fist!  And today wasn't really my fault either. I am taking a horrible class Accounting 101, don't ask why its a long horrible story. The abridged Reader's Digest version is I need a C or better to go to UCR and I am sucking ass in this class. Who knew the anti-capitalist would have no sense for business huh?? But I digress. I got a tutor, one of my so called friends who just got his Masters in the damn field. And so, I have a huge test on Saturday (its online so there is no teaching) and I made 4 appointments with my tutor and yea, yesterday morning he tells me he can meet me that day at 1pm... I was more than peeved and vexed. So, I had thought I would be able to study with Scott (tutor) and be cool to see Rob a couple times... Until the fool hasn't shown, and this is the second test I am not prepared for. Then of course my older brother is visiting, and you know there is no end to "brotherly council." Okay, I am done, hopefully Rob will read this and get more of a gist for where I'm coming from... When someone is upset with me, I kind of clam up so he doesn't know this stuff...   On a brighter note, I decided that going to a public library to study is a bad idea. I kept people watching and they become characters in my story and yea... too much time was lapsing and I grabbed a book on Van Gogh and so, yea, school library in a cubicle (I don't stare at people our age as much as children and older folks.... not in a pervy way either.) If anyone wants to see what is going on with my random short story synthesis, let me know... Cheers mates!
