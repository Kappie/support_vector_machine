There is just no time before August 18th to do it. In addition to it being just a birthday party, it will also be a "Welcome to America Mariatina!" party. I want to give her time to rest and adjust at least a litttle before she meets my crazy friends.  Rehersal wasn't bad today. We FINALLY finished act one. Thank God. We still havn't done the "With You" dance, which is good because my pointe shoes just came in the mail today. I don't want to have to sew them tonight thought. Anyway I hope I don't make a complete fool of myself doing an enitre pointe dance.. I am still not very strong in the ballet area. And Natalie has never done pointe so I don't know if she will be able to make the technical corrections I will need. Man I am nervous. We learned the tecet for Glory today and that is a fun dance. Except for the fact the my hat kept falling off and it didn't work at all. I have already practiced it tonight but I don't remember the order of all the moves. By the way, that dance is also original Fosse choreography.. lifted straight from the video by Jen and Natalie. But mostly Jen. Pippin will be a good show if all the pieces fall together.  Richelle is coming over in an hour and we are going to finish episodes 6- 12 of season 4 of Sex in the City. Should be a good night.  Oh! Monday Paul is doing a play reading at Plenty! I am so there.. anyone know what time it is?  Thats really all I have for now.. maybe I will update this later today. Leave me a comment if you have read this I would love to hear what you have to say!  Love and God Bless, Caitlin
