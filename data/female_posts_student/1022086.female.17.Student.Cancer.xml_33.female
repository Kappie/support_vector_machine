The repertoire (mainly for Hinkle, as I said I'd post it): "Clap Yo' Hands" (Gershwin) "The World is Full of Poetry" (Brunner) "Three Ways to Vacuum Your House, Segment II" (Hatsfield) "Wade in the Water" (Althouse, I think) "Amazing Grace" (Can't think of arranger) "Salve Regina" (er, composer again...) "Go Where I Send Thee" (agh, composer!!!)   My favourite is "The World is Full of Poetry". It is also the one I sound most awful on. It is absolutely beautiful, but the range is insane for we Alto I's. We're on a key of B, and they expect us to go up to a high E! I can hit it, mind you, but it doesn't sound pretty-- what sounds worse are the descending eighth notes right after the E... oi.   I have a semi-solution to the problem. The song is in English, but if I don't sing the English and substitute "aaaah"s for higher notes and "ooo"s for the lower, I can sound pretty nice, sort of. I know that, for the audition, we're not required to sing the foreing language songs on words, but I don't know about English. From what I understand, they're going to score the actual music and not diction and such, but I don't know whether they expect me to sing in English. When I sing the English, I sound atrocious. I really hope I can "ooo" my way through it... I'll have to talk to Ms. B. about that.   "Three Ways to Vacuum Your House" is THE stuff. It is so incredibly cool, likely one of the most awesome choral songs I've ever worked on. It's super fun, and with work, I think I'll get that one all right. I have a lot of work left to do on the music, and I've only got a month. On that note, I should work on it a bit tonight.    I don't think there's a chance of my passing the AP Chemistry final examination. I'm still going to try it, for I suffered entirely too much for a year not to, but I am not sure I'll even pass it. There's just so much that I cannot remember that I need to remember.    SAT is coming my way entirely too quickly. There's something else that I need to prepare for... I'm worried about that, too. The stupid College Board (Satan)... how I despise them. This could make me or break me... moo...    However, there is a bright side to everything!!! First of all, we're on a five-day weekend, which should help me get some rest and things I need to get done done, and secondly, we're adopting a homeless kitten!!!  Her owner couldn't keep her, so she is currently at a pet shelter. She will be here tomorrow evening. Her name is Asia, and she's only a few months old. That's about all I know, but I'm still so excited. I really hope that Shah will accept her; I think he will. This is going to be great. Shah and Asia. He's going to have another kitty to collogue with. I hope that will serve to un-depress him a bit, since he still seems really down. Of course, we're going to have to be careful and be sure that there isn't a total shift of attention toward the kitten-- as long as attention is balanced, everything will be fine.  I just sincerely hope that we're not embarking on a new era of couch-peeing. We already went through that with Shah once, and that was enough, hehe.    Well, I have a pile of junk to get done, so I'd better get crackin'.  To all, to all, a fair, good... evening!!    "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega   I am sitting In the morning At the diner On the corner  I am waiting At the counter For the man To pour the coffee  And he fills it Only halfway And before I even argue  He is looking Out the window At somebody Coming in  "It is always Nice to see you" Says the man Behind the counter  To the woman Who has come in She is shaking Her umbrella  And I look The other way As they are kissing Their hellos  I'm pretending Not to see them Instead I pour the milk  I open Up the paper There's a story Of an actor  Who had died While he was drinking It was no one I had heard of  And I'm turning To the horoscope And looking For the funnies  When I'm feeling Someone watching me And so I raise my head  There's a woman On the outside Looking inside Does she see me?  No she does not Really see me Cause she sees Her own reflection  And I'm trying Not to notice That she's hitching Up her skirt  And while she's Straightening her stockings Her hair Is getting wet  Oh, this rain It will continue Through the morning As I'm listening  To the bells Of the cathedral I am thinking Of your voice...  And of the midnight picnic Once upon a time Before the rain began...  I finish up my coffee It's time to catch the train
