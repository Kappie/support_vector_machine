I was born on the most freaking stormy day in the history of Bangladesh. Thus the name Brishty. (Rain, doink!) I moved to Birmingham when I was three. I graduated from St. Benedicts Kindergarten in 1994. I will never go to my primary school alumni thing ever. Those were my shady days where I had no friends and the people were too Singaporean for me. ( No offence though) I can hold a grudge really well. I have stopped talking to people for months at a time.      I easily forgive if someone asks. Kinda weird huh? My favorite shoe brand is Adidas. Although I like slippers best. The worst day in my life will have to be the day my parents 'caught' me and realised the stuff I really do. It isnt so bad but to them it was earth-shattering. I don't like my school, but I am sticking it out as long as I can get into UCL. If I don't get into UCL, I will probably end up at UEA and that will be the end of my uni life. I like celebrating my birthday, because I love the attention. Thats one day you can call your own and its a step closer to that freedom who keep hearing about. My favorite author is Sylvia Plath solely because I have most of her books. I wish I had more time for recreational reading, but school takes up far too much time. I never used to short in my life. I was a tall baby, even back in the dark days. My all time favorite song is Rendenzous by Craig David. My favorite band is Evanescence. I love their music and Amy Lee has an awesome voice. I don't listen to Oasis anymore. It opens up too many wounds. The dumbest thing I have ever done was getting caught up with my social scene that I totally ignored other stuff and soon enough in the end it all came crashing down on me. The smartest thing I ever did was not ot be stupid and mope over it. :) I far prefer Smirnoff to Bacardi. The only time I have ever smoked pot was horrible for me. I have no desire to touch it (pot, not men, J). :) I don't think I have an addictive personality. It's mostly to set an example. I have never stole cigarettes or alchohol and shall never do it due to previous accusations. Tight shirts is the biggest turnoff I can think of. I have issues with telling people how I feel. I usually think they don't care and just let it build inside of me until I pop. I would cry if Charmed, OC, Alias or Gilmore Girls  were cancelled. I have cried in the past month for bad judgement. My duck,Sutha, is my best friend. I was not impressed with the Paris Hilton tape. It looked like she was in Baghdad. Diet Vanilla Pepsi = my drink of choice I collect bags and shoes now that I'm in UK. I can actually get the size. I want a yellow Volkswagon GTI or black Mitsubishi Evo. I have no political affiliation. I vote for whoever I think is less of a dumbass. I cant vote though but always felt that was my only ticket into the political world. My favorite gadget is by far the iPod.  Funny I dont have one. But I played around with Rhea's.  The dumbest thing I ever bought was my first walkman. It broke after a week and I never got it back from repairs. The best concert I ever went to was Evanscence when they came to London. They rocked out. I want to see      Usher      in concert. Most peopleI don't care about enough to fork over the cash. I am very self conscious of my appearance. I have seldom bouts of low self esteem. My main goal in life is to be a lawyer. I have never had serious boyfriends. I don't regret either, because I learned a lot from them. I have never played the lottery. I am too cheap. My biggest vise would be drinking entirely too many cherry cokes and eating too much chocolate. I sure do lead an exciting life. I love flying and hotel rooms.  I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies. Never made through one in the cinema. The first thing i will buy when I graduate from university  will be make a statement that I am not moving back in. I don't think I will ever get married. I don't think anyone would be able to put up with me. I don't know if i even care that much. My favorite holiday used to be Eid. Now it has no meaning, whatsoever. I hate Christmas food. I could not care less about sports. My favorite restaurant is Taco Bell. My least favorite restaurant is New Mumbai Vegetarian Restaurant. When I am really stressed out and just want to clear my head, I cram it with useless stuff. I am terrified of public speaking. I usually do well at it, but before it I am always worried. My favorite time waster is working on this here website. I wish I had more time to do stuff with it that I want to, but I have come to the sad realization that it is a low priority in the scheme of things. I am still amazed that people read this crap I post. I am a major klutz. I feel      Sean Combs       model shouldnt be so haaawwwt. I like to listen music all the time.I can't stand staying in silence.. I hate chatting on the net. I hate it cuz people dont get you're being sarcastic(which 95% of the time I am).I have started to become more straighforward now. I am very shy when I first meet someone, but usually open up once I get to know them more. I have lived in at least 12 houses. Maybe more. I lost count. I have got a cast iron stomach. i am all about Pier 1 candles. They make my room smell nice. :) From the looks of me you'll think I'm quite messy. I have an impressive collection of makeup. I've stopped cuz I'm poor.  I don't like my financial state. I think Singapore is the best place for me. The thing i am most proud of is saving the cash up to buy my phone. It was one of the first big time goals I set and reached. I would prefer being really cold than hot. I want to go to a sushi buffet one day. I have trust issues with people. I trust absolutely no one. I have been burnt too many times. I consider very few people friends. I have acquaintances, but very few friends. I set my standards really high in that category. I trust friends. The best year of my life 2nd and 3rd year of secondary school. This year is the worst of my life. I spend entirely too much time messing around on the net. Evianis the best bottled water. I used to have nice hair. I am somewhat of a snob. I don't really care though. I am somewhat anti boredom. Cant stand just sitting down and doing nothing. I have no problem admitting that I am wrong. I am rarely wrong though in my opinion. ;) I loathe the current situation in my life. I used to have hair down to my shoulders. It was good. I haven't thrown up in  6 months. The worst experience of my life was getting my chin stiched back together. That hurt like hell. I dont think I can ever drive I drink 4 litres of water almost every day. I cant cook. I have days where I just sit at my computer and lose track of time. The most boring 4 hours of my life is the drive from Norwich to Brighton. The scenery is so drab. I wish I had more time to devote to my art. I am a sucker for depressing music. I don't like moving. You just have to do everything all over again. Much like when you delete an important file and  you have to retype it. I try to get my hair cut every 6 months and its not even planned. (till now) My biggest fear is that I am going to fail at life once I graduate. I have transferred between way too many schools. I have spent entirely too much time compiling this list. I don't like being like everyone else.
