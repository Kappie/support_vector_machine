And I didn't have the bright idea to call Abner's house after I talked to Lola on her cell phone, until this morning.  So...I missed it.  We're having one when i get back.  I've missed far to many.  I think I'm starting to get a bit homesick.  I miss all you guys.  The feeling is not completely mutual though.  I talked to my brother on the phone yesterday, and I asked him if he realized he hadn't talked to me in close to a month.  He went Whoa, when did you leave?  Glad at least my family loves me.  But he is only 13.  I suppose he can be excused. So wild day in the medical world today.  We saw patients all morning, and I got the stack of charts I've been sorting since I got here done today.  Woohoo!  Then we went in at about 3pm for the emergency surgery, and they weren't ready, so we didn't get sarted until almost 3:45.  I was about to sit down to observe, when my aunt says, "Patty (her nurse practitioner) why don't you take Amanda, and show her how to scrub up."  Pretty sure my mouth dropped open.  So I went out, and I was really confused for a while, because I don't quite understand all the sterility rules.  So two gowns, and a pair of too small gloves later, I was scrubbed in.  At first I was just observing, and I could actualy get close enough to see things.  Then the ovarian cyst we were trying to remove exploded all over.  This poor lady had a cyst the size of a grape fruit in her stomache. She thought she had been gaining weight, but it was all fluid.  I ended up having to hold retractors, and clamps, and even helped to close the patient.  Not many other high school students will do this.  I'm still in awe that she let me help.  If I was her, I wouldn't have let me help. But that is my story of the day, I'm going to go have my supper, and then see if I can't actually talk to someone tonight.  See you all in 3 days.
