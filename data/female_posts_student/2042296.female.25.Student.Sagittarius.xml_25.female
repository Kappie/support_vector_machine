Decided to play some heroic heavy metal to really wake up. I don't understand how I managed to sleep this long, the cats didn't bother me, cause Rico gave them food and then came back to bed. I had some cottage cheese and now I'm chewing sugarless blackcurrant candies (I hope this time I'm able to control this, since last time I got diarrhoea from the candies :D), wonderful. I'm looking for some coffee, do I have to make my darn coffee myself? :o Normally Rico makes coffee for me on weekends, so sweet is he :)  I had a really shitty start for a day yesterday... I got mail from the company I'd sent a job application to and they said that I'd be most welcome to the information/interview meeting, if I were Swiss citizen or had a proper residence permit (type C). Well, I'm a Finnish citizen and have a type B residence permit. The reason was that they find it too much financial and temporal trouble to get me a work permit from the kanton I'm living in. Fuck them, I say. Well, I have a couple of other applications I sent, we'll see, if they also are such rotten nationalist firms ;) I was so frustrated and disappointed and cried at for an hour or so. I know people who live here and are not even looking for a job and I get nothing although I've sent about 20 applications. Well, I haven't tried McDonald's or Burger King yet :>   But then I went to meet the literature teacher at the university and it was good. She is such a good teacher and knows what she's speaking of, although she's young. I really like her. Then I came home and it became even better. Rico had wanted to buy me some roses, but he doesnt' like cut flowers since they die so fast. He had then bought me a rose tree! :) A little (ca. 50cm tall), sweet, beautiful rose tree with yellow blooms :) He had also cleaned up the kitchen (I had planned to do that when I come home, since I was reading the whole day)... I LOVE HIM, LOVE HIM, LOVE HIM!   So, we're driving to the Kraftwerk concert to Bern today and before that I'd like to do a couple of things, like re-plant the tomatoes etc. That means, a dieu!
