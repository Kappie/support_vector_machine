That is- after an estimated hour of listening to bull from my parents about how stores haven't even put out white dresses yet... They were wrong. hehe- i have one put on hold! Eeeii!! So excited, finally graduating! but it was prtty funni, while I was trying on one of the dresses some of the red shit in my hair came out on the dress... and the dress is white. But shsssssssss... hahah.   I'm really nervous about this whole ss thing on tuesday. Its saturday now, something is tellin me i should probly know more than just south america and parts of europe. oh well- tomorrow we'll find out how bad my procrastination REALLY is. Not to mention that we have a game tomorrow, and we HAVE to win. Honestly- we can't loose another game (even if this is only our 2nd of the season) I don't feel like running any more sprints.  But back to the ss- yeah, i need to focus and actually study... too bad i kinda spaced it out until now.   BTW! Everyone should donate their old shoes to Alison's foundation. That girl is soo cool! hehe- and the funny thing I'm saying this in all seriousness- i don't even owe her money!   Aiii... i'm tired, i need 2 shower and snl is on in 20.... so i guess i gg... haha.  NigHT!
