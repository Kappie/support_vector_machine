Very boring though... Then after everything is about 2++pm? So while e other girls gone home.. I found 1 of my female classmates, XINYI, who has "passion" about Kendo..haha, then she agreed to go Kendo Trainning session in e evening at about 6+pm with me!.. Hahah, then, we didnt go home... Just join e guys to AMK there.. N these guys arh... REally nothing to say, our school NYP is located sooooooo near to AMK, then only across e juntion, yet they still took TAXI?!?!?... Hahah...to them, taking taxi is much cheaper.. From our 03 classchairman, Mr Adrian Tan's theory.. If go AMK by MRT, each person will have to pay 63cents of fare.. Then if 4 person take a taxi.. is only across e junction.. Then e meter is $2.40, so each person pays only 60cents.. 3cents lesser!!.. (WEll,...IS LAME!!!!) Nvertheless we took e taxi lar...coz 2gether have 8 of us?.. 6 guys 2 gals..haha..  When reached, there...of course all e guys went to play pool lo.. Then me n xinyi sat at e side of e table chit chatting... For sometimes, i think should let xinyi try abit, coz she never touch those cues before... So i suggest to let xinyi play lo.. In e end..i kena..hahah.. Which only left me n my dear classchairman playing e pool..SUDDENLY ar..Dunno y, ALL of them went missing like that lehz... ALL hidden at a corner laughing.. LIEW~~~~ Come on lar class03, dont suddenly do this kind of stunt to me lehz..... Should know something about me right?... " i shy ar..."...hahhaha... Sounds farmiliar?.. I said this sentance frm the start of school already okie?!?!?!?!.... Hahaha... Anyway, then in e end finally i got xinyi to play e pool herself..with 3 guys teaching her.. (She's much more fortunate..at least whole lot of us never went missing in action..haha..)   Quite fun actually...then me n xinyi laze around until 5.30pm like that.. we went off to e NYP by walking...N is like.. VERY VERY VERY near lo........... -_-|||  Waa...Nver know that e School Sports Hall sooooooo far... is right frm one end to e other!.. Hahah..then went there, outside e sports hall, must take off our shoes n socks, bowed, then 1st step in is left foot... (e procedures whereby every kendo memebers must follow) Overall, we did some warming up...some basic steps.. then sweating all over, with our jeans n pants...............-_-||| Anyway, is like quite interesting.. we also watched e seniors playing with everything on their body (looks heavy n thick!!.. ) together with their "Shinei", i think is e bamboo sword...yeah.. E way they play is like...."waaa.....beat soo hard on e head...haha...skali later faint ar..." But quite okie lar....much more fun then wat i thought.. is like e basic training like i had during sec 1 in Gal guides...when i have to learn e footdrills command all that... Everything ended at around 9+pm... Then is like i haven EAT!!....haha... Went to nearby Mac at my house there n bought something to makan.....  After my bathing...everything, seems soooo tired...haha, then my dear dear gd buddy called... Yes is you... is you.... IBNU FIRDAUS..( did i spell e name correct?..hahahaha..) This fellow, my gd buddy during seconday school life... Always got sooooooooo jealous about little things lehz...hahahha... Now know why he called yesternite? Coz he saw SOMEONE's name keep on appearing in my blogspot.. N his name only mentioned once lo............... Hahah...then started e crap like "yeah lar, 4get this 4 yrs friend liao lar........ blah blah blah..........." Hhahahhahahaa.... so i say, Adrian, u dead man..next time he sees you might use e "shinei" n wack u.... Hahhahahha... Nah.. just kidding.... Ibnu is a nice guy...
