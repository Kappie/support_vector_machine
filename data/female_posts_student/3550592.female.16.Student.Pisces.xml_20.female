I have a problem that I cannot explain, I have no reason why it should have been so plain, Have no questions but I sure have excuse, I lack the reason why I should be so confused,  I know, how I feel when I’m around you, I don’t know, how I feel when I’m around you, Around you,  Left a message but it ain’t a bit of use, I have the pictures, the wild might be the deuce, Today you called, you saw me, you explained, Playing the show and running down the plane,  I know, how I feel when I’m around you, I don’t know, how I feel when I’m around you, I know, how I feel when I’m around you, I don’t know, how I feel when I’m around you, Around you, around you, around you...
