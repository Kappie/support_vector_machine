I can't think back that far right now and I need to get back into my homework anyway.  2/7/04  - 3:37 AM  So I have been fairly worried about this Grammy trip for a while now.  Things just seemed to go wrong all over the place and the closer it got the more I wanted to cancel.  But because it was a gift there wasn’t really an option for that.  So anyway I spent the entire week before telling all of my professors that I would be gone for classes and where I would be and their excitement got me excited so I was very much looking forward to it.  Then on Wednesday Susan called to confirm that she was in fact going to come with me and Wendi called to confirm she was going to drive to meet me on Saturday.  So everything seemed to be going well.  I went to bed that night and set my alarms although I tossed and turned till about three in the morning.  I finally fell asleep knowing that my flight left at the crack of dawn but also knowing that it was going to be a long flight and I could sleep then.  So don’t ask what happened because I don’t know but the next thing I knew I was hearing Sam’s alarm across the hall going off (the same alarm that annoys me every other day) and I woke up to check the clock.  It was funny cause I felt so rested and thought how strange that was.  I had set my alarm so that I would wake up at 6:15 AM at the latest.  I looked at the clock and it was 9 AM.  I freaked out.  My flight had left about ten minutes prior.  I’ve never missed a flight in my lifetime.  So anyway, I called the airline and got put on hold, got online and told Pandy to tell Jess to get online right away.  She told me to get off the phone, call the taxi and just go to the airport.  I have never in my life rushed so much.  I threw everything in the suitcase, shut it up tight and walked out.  My taxi came and we rushed to the airport.  I spent 40 bucks on that taxi which pisses me off because there is no need for it to be so expensive.  Anyway so then I get to the airport, go to US Airways and they tell me that even though the flight was booked through them there is nothing they can do because I was flying with United.  So I have to go downstairs, find a shuttle and take it over to the next terminal.  I get to the correct terminal walk inside only to find out that the escalator there is broken and I didn’t want to walk to find another so I simply dragged my heavy ass bag up the stairs to the second floor.  I found United and they were very nice but they couldn’t get me on another flight that was going direct to L.A. till late that night.  They were able to book me if I changed planes in Chicago.  So I took it, called Michelle to tell her not to wait at the airport for me as originally planned and I would call her when I touched down.  I called Susan just on the off chance she wanted to fly with me from Chicago and she tells me the weather is getting really bad and that they may delay my plane.  So anyway, it’s like 10 AM and I wait around the airport for two hours till my plane boards.  The first flight was fine but it was delayed just enough to have my freaking out about making my connector flight.  Then I got to Chicago to find out that Susan had decided to come with me and that she was waiting at the gate.  I had to go from Terminal C to Terminal B which is a mad dash at O’Hare.  Finally I met up with her, we got on the flight which was half empty and I was able to sit in Economy Plus which is a bit bigger than regular Economy along with Susan.  We got to watch Master and Commander, which I liked, and soon enough we were there.  Once at the airport I called Michelle who told me the taxi would be $50 or we could take the shuttle for $15.  We opted for the shuttle.  So anyway, back at the hotel we go down to the bar to get a drink and we end up eating dinner there.  Eventually Michelle and Jill’s sister Susan come and join us.  We drink and talk until finally we all get tired and go to bed.  	So Friday morning Michelle calls at about 9:30 AM and tells me she is going downstairs to smoke and eat breakfast.  I make a mad dash to get ready and go down to join her.  We have breakfast and other Susan and Robin come down to join us.  We decide to go over to Macy’s Plaza and shop.  Susan and I decide to walk over while Robin, Michelle and other Susan go by town car.  Once over we run into Michelle.  We shop and… well they shopped and I watched.  Then on our walk back we notice the Aveda Hair Salon and I need a trim so I ask the woman at the front desk how much and she tells me $40 and I can get in right away.  So I tell Michelle and Susan to go on without me and I wait.  I speak with the woman doing my hair while she’s washing it and she asks me why I am in L.A. and I tell her that I am going to the Grammy awards and particularly that night I am going to the MusiCares Award dinner for Sting.  So she cuts my hair and then styles it up (like my hair dresser at home does after a cut for the same price so why would I think anything is wrong with this) and by the way, I like the cut and hated the style.  So I go to pay the bill and the woman tells me for the cut and the style it will be $70.  This is crazy cause I never asked the woman to do it but I suck at speaking up and hand over my credit card.  During all this they are trying to get me to schedule an appointment for Sunday, I am already thinking no way in hell since I hate the style.  So I hand over my credit card and it declines.  Which sucks cause I am thinking I have $100 left on it.  I then hand over my check card, which declines.  So I have to call Susan (who had already offered to pay for my style) to come down and pay for it.  She does and I am way embarrassed because this has never happened before, plus it was more than I said I wanted, plus I didn’t even like the style I had paid extra for.  So she very happily does and we walk back and we stop at a deli and she buys me lunch and I am feeling incredibly down and sad at the time.  Not to mention the guilt and embarrassment of having to have my cousin save my ass.  So we walk to the hotel room and we are talking and I am just down and sad and finally Susan says she wants to go walk around more so I call Mom and leave her a message to see if she can put more money in my account and I call Jess to bitch.  I feel better after talking to her and then Mom calls back to say she’ll put $100 in the account tomorrow. 	So 5 rolls around and I go downstairs to meet everyone and we take a limo over to Sony Studio Picture Lot for the Sting dinner.  So after walking the red carpet and having our picture taken (they think that pregnant Robin is Kelly Clarkson) we go to the silent auction.  There we see Laura Liney.  So then we go back outside to stand by the carpet till they let us into the main studio the event is being held in and we see Nile Rogers, Elton John, Hugh Heffner and seven or eight playboy bunnies, John Mayer, Sting and his wife Trudie and their oldest child, Patricia Heaton, and maybe others I can’t remember right now.  So we go in and we see amazing AND I MEAN AMAZING performances by Elton John, Rufus Wainwright, Dave Matthews, Black Eyed Peas, Tony Bennett, Mary J Blige, John Mayer, Wynonna, and a couple others I cannot remember.  We also see Bob something or another give a great speech (he helped to found Band-aid) and Dustin Hoffman give great speeches about Sting.  Oh and of course the finally was Sting performning two songs finishing with an amazing disco-esque version of Send Your Love.   It was very cool.  Oh and I got a fabulous gift bag which I was happy with.  2/10/04 – 6:21 AM So back in Cambridge now.  Needless to say I will make this brief because I am sick and laying in bed and I have no desire to type for hours on end.  On the day of the 7th Wendi drove into town and we went to Hollywood.  We got to see Gramman’s Chinese Theater and then we just walked down Hollywood.  It’s a pretty seedy place.  I loved seeing Wendi again.  So anyway, later we’re at the Ivy in Santa Monica which is slightly disappointing because I want to go to the one in Beverly Hills but whatever.  So I get the Caprese Salad and water just because I am not hungry.  But anyway, so we are leaving the restaurant.  So Robin heads back to the hotel and I go with Susan B., Michelle, and Susan to the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel.   So the next night we went to the Grammy’s.  We went through yet another fiasco with the limo and finally got dropped off in the front.  We came to find out that we were never going to walk the red carpet and when we were dropped off we walked over to the front of this other building.  We were just standing there when we realized the pre-award show grammy’s were being given away inside.  We saw more stars up close there than if we had walked the red carpet.  We saw Annette O’Toole, Michael McKeon, Quentin Tarrentino, Sheryl Crow, Tony Bennett, and suddenly I am blanking on everyone else we saw walk right past us.  We also saw a ton of people at the grammy’s themselves, Sharon Osbourne walked right by me as did so many others.  The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy guys were sitting right in front and behind us.  Anyway, so then we moved on to the after party and at this point I am starting to feel very sick, I had felt scratchy all day but at this point I am really starting to feel bad.  So I go back to the hotel, go to bed and sure enough when I wake up in the morning I am hit with a full cold and it just gets continuously worse through the day.  So here I am sitting in my bed after missing another whole day of classes because I was basically incapacitated.  Now I don’t feel any better but I have to gear up for tomorrow because I cannot afford to miss any more classes or work.
