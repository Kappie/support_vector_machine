Jesus Christ O'Mighty i can say it over and over again, yet i can't make any sense of it. Gay. She's gay.  I don't get it. I don't understand how she can be gay now. I don't understand any of this. She's gay. It still doesn't click with me. She's a lesbian. I don't get it. I don’t know how I really feel about it. I mean she is my sister and all, but I don’t know what to think about her sexuality. When she first told me I was shocked, but I went along with it. I pretended I was fine and everything, but I’m not. I remember telling her before, how I thought gay marriage and all that stuff was great, and if two people love each other it doesn’t matter if they are the same gender. whatta bunch of bull shit. The fact is, I’m fine w/  other  people being bi or gay, but not her. I hate myself for being like this, how Slim Shady, but I can’t help it. I don’t know what the big deal is; I mean I was fine before she told me! It’s just now whenever we are watching TV or something and a girl appears, it always seems like she is checking her out (though she probably isn’t). I guess I should have seen this coming when she was always the first to watch the Victoria Secret Fashion Show(note to self: burn all catalogs containig women in underwear), but how was I to know.  I just wish I could pop some “heterosexual pills” in her mouth, and make her straight again. I don't think she ever was straight. When I think about it, I really don't know who my sister is. I've known her for all my life, without knowing her. Who knows what else she's been keeping for me, she could have three nipples for all i know! Okay, that's a little far fetched, but i really can't think rationally right now. Apparently, she's known for sometime now, i guess she was trying to get in touch with her inner Melissa Ethridge or something. Now she's a full blown rainbow-flag waving homo. Shame on me. I should be happy for her, she's not lying to herself anymore. But I can't help but be pissed. I don't know exactly why I'm pissed, but I am. I guess I had this little fantasy that me and my sis would finally go to college together and double date and talk about boys and laugh and giggle about the hottest guys on campus. I can't really picture myself going all gigglely over a guy or really wasting time talking about one, but still. Now I  never  have a chance to do that with her. I had this stellar fairytale world for us, now it's gone. I'm so selfish, all i can say is I I I I. I can't even take the time to see how she's feeling about coming out. I'm starting to think that i don't know a fucking thing about anyone anymore. Or anything, for that matter.
