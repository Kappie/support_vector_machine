As Christmas and the New Year near us, I would like to take the time to point out that this blog celebrated it's first birthday on December 14th.  Amazing, eh?  God, I've been through so much this year, that reading the back logs kind of blows my mind.  It's also kind of depressing, because I don't really feel like I've grown as a person.  Oh well.  The situation at the apartment is, for the time being, good.  Perhaps it's because I stood up for myself?  Perhaps they have pity on the less fortuneate on the holidays?  Who knows.  I haven't been home in several weeks.  It's kind of embarrasing, because I kind of forgot my mother's birthday (It was December 12th).  I know exactly what to get her (a new book by one of her favorite authors, Jonathan Kellerman), so hopefully I'll get my ass home soon and give it to her.  Well, it's almost past my bed time, so I'm getting off here.  Later.
