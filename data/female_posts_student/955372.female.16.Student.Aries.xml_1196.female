"double d" I, however, am not a really fat guy.   C - Chore you hate – pick one  D - Dad's name - Lucifer, but his friends call him Bob  E - Essential make up item – chap stick/ lip gloss, and concealer when I haven't had a good night's sleep  F - Favorite actor – colin firth, a close second is hugh grant. And that guy who plays Jeff on Coupling (BBC) is my god. The fact that they are all british has nothing to do with it... baha.  G - Gold or silver - silver's prettier in my opinon.  H - Hometown – South Philly, a block away from the projects. Yeah, it was a good neighborhood  I - Instruments you play – ooo, that'd be nothing. Seriously, I can't even play the triangle. Or like finger symbols.  J - Job title - receptionist. That's what they call me, but I'm really that person in the office that sits at the front desk and makes office supply jewelry all day. I have a paper clip tiara coming along nicely  K - Kids – EW. I hate kids. They're slimy ALL the time, they smell and they grope you when you're not looking. Plus they want to be fed like all the time. Stupid little fuckers.  L - Living arrangements – my ugly room. Stupid hideous wall color. I've devised a plan though. If my parents won't let me paint it (the stupid constantly shit-faced fuckers) I'm going to hang sarong/tapastry type things so you can't see it. It's genius.  M - Mum's name - Clara  N - Number of people you've kissed - Right, let me post something that personal on my blog.  O - Overnight hospital stays – only on overnight stay, when dad had some crazy kidney stone thing. yeah, that was fun. He was all "i have appendicitis" and we had to go to the hostpital at 2 o'clock in the morning, and he's like "oh wait just kidding'  P - Phobia –muppets. I don't care what anyone says they are fucking creepy and they give me nightmares  Q - Quote you like – "I did everything he did only backwards and in high heels"- Ginger Rogers  R - Religious affiliation – agnostic/atheist i guess. I don't know. One of those. It's kind of hard to label something like that  S - Siblings – one, little sister, gio  T - Time you wake up? 6:30 during the week, ususally 11 (i'd sleep later if my family wasn't so fucking loud) on the weekends  U - Unique ability – i can make anything sound dirty  V - Vegetable you refuse to eat - mushrooms  W - Worst habit – i don't think i have one. I'm pretty happy with all my habits.  X - X-rays you've had – um... only the ones you get at the dentist, and I don't think those count  Y - Yummy food you make – if i make food i can guarentee you it ain't gonna be yummy, or edible. More likely, dangerous to your health.  Z - Zodiac Sign - aries, the ram baby!
