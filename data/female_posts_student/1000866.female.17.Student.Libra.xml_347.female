I don't know, I felt really stressed out all of a sudden, and I just kept thinking, "I have a whole year of this crap." It was odd because I NEVER stress out. I think I am the farthest you can be on the spectrum of a type B personality. I'm pretty laid back, so I didn't get it. Just, all of a sudden everything seemed so overwhelming, and this is an easy week. Eeek.   My History book weighs like...300 pounds....argh. It makes me mad. I want to throw it at someone...if I could lift it.   Anyyyywayyyy, my classes are tolerable so far so, eh.   And, argh. I think I like him. :( I'm trying not to sooo so very hard. Ah well. I give up....no, not really...but, I'm going to try giving up...  I'm through with this blog entry. Finished.
