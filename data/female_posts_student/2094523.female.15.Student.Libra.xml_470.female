Summer is sposed to be a time for flings, partying, gettin drunk, gettin laid, doin weed, hookin' up, hotel rooms, or so thats what it seems.. Well ive defied the meaning of summer and have not done any of the above. Whats wrong with me they ask? absolutely nothing.   I need to get away for a while. Just out of edmonton or something. theres no telling what im missing out of the real world by lockin myself up in this room with just the computer and me.  "Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die I think I made it a game to play your game  And let myself cry  I buried myself alive on the inside So I could shut you out And let you go away for a long time"   Buried Myself Alive by the Used
