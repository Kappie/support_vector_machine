I can't wait to come home, just to sleep in my own house, smell the fresh air for more than 2-3 hours every few days. I am anxious to visit my grandparents. Anxious to visit my mom and Richard.    Been bummed the past few days.  Just dealing with some issues. Nothing to elaborate on but it's just been a rough few days.  I keep looking towards the light at the end of the tunnel.  7 Weeks and counting.  My friend, Jason, the Entertainer, leaves tomorrow. I am sadden because he has been a great friend. He too will be returning to the Mercury after his vacation is over. Quite a few people are returning here. But, I will be sailing on.  Sailing on the Carribbean.  Many guests have told me that the Century ship is very elegant. I can't wait to see it.  Of course, I don't really want to think about my next contract because that means my vacation will be over.   Anyway, hmm.... I watched a great movie the other night. MatchStick Men. It was really cute.  No news really here. Just enjoying the fast pace of the 7 day cruises.  The weeks are flying by.  San Fran every 6 days. Wish I had more time to spend there though because I only have a quick hour or so to head to lunch and back to the terminal. I emailed my buds in San Fran but haven't heard back from them?!?! Hmm, maybe it's a done deal - no problem though. I think I will just go ahead and head directly home on the 29th so I will have a few days to get settled before Lizaki arrives in Houston. Probably come to Austin on the 2nd or 3rd and stay until the 4th. Then probably comeback there on the 13th. Hmm, I feel like this vacation is going to fly by.  It's tough working for 6 months straight and then ONLY having 2 months off. I was thinking that was a long time intially but now looking at it in retrospect, it isn't much time at all.    I think this next contract will be my last though.  I want to get some things taken care of on land and just finish out school, and move somewhere. Maybe to another state, I don't know.  I think it would be cool to live in another country for sure. I wish my next contract was going to be in the Mediterean, now that would be cool.  My friend Manuel, he's leaving in a week or so and heading for that itnerary.  They called for him to go to that ship - he was expecting to stay here for hi full contract.  Maybe that will happen to me and I will get to go to another ship in the middle of my next contract.   HMMM - Well, I guess I should run. I am having dinner with some guest tonight at 8:00 and I need to freshen up before heading to the dining room. Miss everyone greatly.   xoxox, Shelly  PS>>>>> Guess who's on next cruise with us??  Dennis Haskins - he played Richard Belding, th eprincipal in the series Saved By The Bell.  Hahahaa, how funny, ey????
