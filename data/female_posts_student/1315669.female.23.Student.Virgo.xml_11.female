I never felt so frustrated in my life. Stupid Satan! Now I can't feel the full effects of the church services. =( desperately needed to seek God's words again.. I have felt the seeds of evil ingrained so hard I can't even notice that it's mutating my life so sneakily (eh dun haf such a word hor?). Sighs... What have i gotten myself into? damn. Been playing with too much fire recently now it's getting outta hand.. sinful sinful ok..tink i better go and concuss else I'll be typing nonsense again
