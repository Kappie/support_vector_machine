I went to the school tonight to enroll in the Learn @ Home Program. I'm beginning English. Thing is though, I thought I had 17 credits left to complete my Grade 12, and because of my age, and length of time I've been out of school, it isn't so. I in fact, so far, only have 6 to get. So coooooool So, I could be graduating next June. So far, I qualify for 10 maturity credits, but because I have 2 kids and have maintained a household and other 'life' experiences, I could qualify for the maximum...which is 12. So, I have between 4-6 credits to get, THEN I'M DONE FOR GOOD. That's it for today.
