As a political science student and Democrat I should probably feel the rally around the flag affect. But for some reason all this hoopla just makes me want to puke. Perhaps it is because the Dem that I would have voted for isn't receiving the nomination. I do, however, stand behind Sen. John Kerry and Sen. John Edwards. And I do not think that this makes me a lemming.  I will vote for the Democratic ticket because I believe that stem cell research should be given full reign, as opposed to being limited to the current cell strains available. I highly believe in a woman's right to choose. I feel that it is not society's place to decide who can marry and who cannot. Marriage is a sacrament and should not be given a definition in an Amendment to the Constitution because that would be a blatant disregard for the Free Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. And requiring a gay marriage to be called a civil union creates a second-class citizenry. Not to mention that those straight couples who are married by a Justice of the Peace, technically have civil unions and not a religiously ordained marriage. I believe that the Patriot Act is no different than the Sedition Acts of the early US, which were subsequently ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I worry that Justice Stevens, the most liberal justice on the Supreme Court will retire and be replaced by a conservative.  For these reasons and others I will vote for the Kerry-Edwards ticket in November. I will certainly be glued to my TV that night hoping that I do not have to find a way to move to England to avoid 4 more years of the Shrub.
