I had flute sectionals yesterday which actually was fun because we played fun games instead of actually practicing music for a little while. I liked it and hopefully they did as well. I took my sister to her oboe lesson after that. It's really boring just waiting around for an hour, i don't like it. I hung out with shelly after that because shes in mexico right now! We had a lotta fun together!  Today i went up to the bandhall again and helped do random things. The tasks he asks us to do are funny. He gave us a ring full of keys and wanted us to check and see which doors around the bandhall each key went to. That's so random, not to mention he had like 4 of these full key rings. Then we put some labels on folders, BUT mr. pace gave us each a bag of m which made it so worth it... haha. After that i went and ate lunch w/ leah and because she works at rainforest cafe she gets a 50% discount at a couple restaurants so it's cool. We ordered way too much food (we didn't realize it was that much) and took home a lot. We felt kinda stupid, but it was funny.  i just realized how terrible my life is going to be once full band camp starts. somehow i forgot that i really can't hang out with anyone once it starts up because it's from 8-12, and then 6-8 something. i only have a few hours in between that where i'm just really tired, and then when i get home at night i'll just want to sleep because it's exhausting. thats crazy. i hardly ever see my family during that time too. that stinks...  i guess that's about it.  and you know, i wouldn't mind a few comments every now and then to make me feel special. :)  adios- Lisa  Song: "Nothing Better" - The Postal Service
