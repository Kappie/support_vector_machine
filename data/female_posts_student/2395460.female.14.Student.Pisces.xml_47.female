Look there are more inside:        And unless I'm mistaken and I missed the newest metrosexual trend of belly shirts for boys, I think still another:     I know, I know those are just pictures, but what does Sync have to say about women, right? Lots. There's a handy guide on how to pick up  women who love men who love gadgets . Got that? If you want an  urban fashionista , she can be found at the Apple Store. Soccer moms are most plentiful at Best Buy.   Women are also questioned about the gadgets they like to see guys carrying. Margarita  loves  guys with iPods, but Jenni is so totally not into guys who carry cell phones on their belts because it's the "worst thing ever".   Gotta go lick my iPod now, bye bye.
