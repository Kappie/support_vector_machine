I want to know who reads this all the time, because apparently there is more than I thought. And no you are not allowed to not post because... you just aren't. I thought I was basically just doing this for my own amusement but I get a kick out of the fact that I am not the only one who is entertained by this. Or maybe you're not entertained and you just read this because you know me. That's cool too. JUST POST, it makes me feel like I have more friends besides my computer.  And, just for good measure:        UPDATE: What am I even doing? No one is going to do this. The people who probably read this are slackers and never do what they are supposed to do. Oh well...
