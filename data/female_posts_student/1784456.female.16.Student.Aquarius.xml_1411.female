Sorry... it's been rattling around in my head for ages! *hey I can't speak English... lets try Spanish instead!* Hey wait a minute... that bit of Spanish didn't work any way! *sigh* Hmm... wonder if I could try french. Je suis Le Poisson Soluble! *well isn't that boring?* Hmm who votes russain! (Don't worry I'm not that freaky* all eyes to Izzy! Nah, I'm crap at those languages anyway. But I guess I could go into my oral exams and tell them that 'I have nothing because I want nothing' and 'I am the soluble fish'. A*! WOHOOO! Nah... I wanna find out what eternal is in Japanese or Chinese and have it enscribed inside a ring. Eternally what...? Eternally here. Ha! I so don't make any sense! *sorry about my delicate 'condition' today, I've had school :P*
