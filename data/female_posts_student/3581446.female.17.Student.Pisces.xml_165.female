Got a lot of intelligent criticism from this one guy I met just today.   Got to listen to the clarinetist again, which was quite enjoyable. Composed a poem on the spot, that I'm honestly a little iffy about, but I think it's decent. (Whitty insists the first two lines are elfen in nature.)  I also tried bubble tea for the first time today- it's pretty good. It has most of the refreshing qualities of coffee, but tastes a bit sweeter, and is more thirst-quenching. The taste's somewhat bizzare, especially at first, but it's good IMO.   Course, one of the funnest part was scoping out the cute Chinese girls who work there... Heheh...   -Theo
