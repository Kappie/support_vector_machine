Sports Update: Coppell takes on Flower Mound (psh like they have a chance when they've only won like...2 games and we just beat them 8-0 a few days ago) for the beginning of the section playoffs en route to state.  Come, represent and watch hockey.  It'll be fun.  Dallas plays Edmonton on Wednesday at 8pm (i think) without Marty Turco for the 3rd time, one more game and then he's back.  $5 we lose in overtime 3-2.  Britt says because we're at home, things might change....i dunno, but i'm a pretty faithless person when it comes to sports by nature not to mention pessimistic but whatever.  Go Stars and Go Cowboys.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
