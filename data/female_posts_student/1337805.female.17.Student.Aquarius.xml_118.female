Late for worship, was sad about that because worship is fairly important. Went back the room, started to almost snuggle with K. Just get comfortable with everyone in the room, we get called out because someone has already broken community, the rules, by smoknig pot in their room....Not too cool. Everyone gets up and goes for a walk, and we steal a lugagge cart and start pushing people around. I break away from the group with him, and we go walking around the campus. We hit were another group was, out having a stroll with a smoke, K bums a smoke (but never smokes it himself) and we talk about this guy wanting to be a unitarian. We walk off, and go find this stairwell, and sit in it. Not talking, just hudled close together, keeping each other warm, waiting for something. My heart starts to rapidly poubd in my chest, I feel like its about to explode in pieces everywhere. Finally, after what could be hours, days, months, years, he reaches over and kisses me..Softly and gentle at first, then powerful and strong, unleashing power and lust caught up for ever...
