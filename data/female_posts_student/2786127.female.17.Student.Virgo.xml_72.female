It looked like someone had viciously bitten in a million times. The edges weren't serated anymore as much as they were burnt slightly brown. While staci babbled about how i shouldn't keep the dime because it could infect my other change i wondered, what the hell has this dime been through? What has it seen...  Fascinateing.  Me? Drunk.  I haven't been able to sleep in all these days i've been back. I think i'm still on Hawaii time, i don't get tired until atleast 2 am because back in hawaii we went to bed around 10. So. its just messed up. I. Tired.  DAn called me the other day. Yeah. Dan. hmm. He tells me he wants to "talk about some things with me" I asked him whats up and he says "well, you know, just wanted to catch up with you, spread shit about people, stuff like that." Weird. I don't like this. Not at all. Though i have secretly been jonesing on this Dan kid for years, I also am not blind to the fact that hes a manipulative son of a bitch. So this convo we're going to be having on Friday should prove to be quite interesting. Quite interesting indeed...  I hung out with Mark, Staci, Chris, Travis, Robbie and Megan last night. It was so fun...I miss having alot of friends. I wish i was a permenant member of their posse, I'm more just a "show up sometimes and chill with everyone" person. Meh. Whateves. But anyways Mark and I did alot of talking and we've decided to go float the river next Tuesday. Tres Excellent....last year was so fun. But this year will be all the more interesting because Tim, nate and i will all be there. Will it be weird? Uncomfortable? All he freaking above...but sadly I only find it to be amusing and interesting...and i can't wait to do it. I want to see how it all plays out, if tim will really kick nates ass, if nate will completely ignore me, or if he'll get jealous that im hanging out with Tim now... Am I a bad person? probs. But i love a good dose of drama every once in awhile.   Anyways. I need to go get ready for things. MA HA!
