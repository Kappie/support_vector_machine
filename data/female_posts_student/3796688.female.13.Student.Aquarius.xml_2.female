They are just such different people than me, it is hard to know we are related. I live on a horse farm, love working hard and having fun at it, and I love being outside. We have 95 acres of land, mostly forest and hay fields so I am outside a lot. They, live in a suburb, terrified of horses, think that trees and rivers are to be looked at from a distance only and hate doing anything that might get you dirty. I went mainly because my grandmother is in the hospital being treated for lung cancer, 2nd time and it is really hard for my grandfather to be alone all day, cook, clean and run 2 jobs, his own and my grandmothers. I think he really enjoyed having someone to talk to, and I learned how to cook all different kinds of food (by trial and error!). It was different, but not my style of living. I will most likely go back before my summer break is over, to help out. While I was there, in ste-agathe that is, I met a very nice man on the train. He was obveously wiccan, he was wearing crystals and a silver pentagram around his neck, so I brought up the subject of wicca. We had a nice conversation about it, I told him what I though about it, and he told me what he thought about it. I think he is one of the braver wiccans, I would never wear a pentagram that was visible. I would be teased so badly and sent to the office at school for  disturbing the peace' . I would much rather laylow about it, just my point of view. I hate it when people start calling you a devil worshipper, and a Satanist. They are obveously totally ignorant to anything about wicca. I saw a quote on a wiccan website that said people that say wiccans are devil worshippers should be told by the wiccan, "I think I'd know if I was worshipping a divinity from another religion." I could not explain how I feel about it any better. It just gets on my nerves so much. My stepfather is like a 3yr old. He always thinks he is right. We had an argument about the word stag. My stepfather said that stag was not a male deer, and I said it was. After arguing about it for a while, I got the dictionary and looked it up. One of the definitions for stag, was male deer. I showed him and he still said it wasn't! Like the book is wrong. That was about a year ago. I have now learned that you might think the person who always thinks they are right is an idiot, but you are an idiot for arguing with them. Wow, I wrote a lot today. I guess I was making up for the short post the other day! Well must go not, I think Wayne and Pat are home, bye!
