She went to a camp for a month and it was an acting camp and at the end of the camp the parents day I guess you could say they put on the play for the public. They learn to project their voice and blocking and all of this great acting knowlegde. It seems really fun. I do a bit of acting not that great but I try. Lucy is a great singer and actress she did so good in the play. I really enjoied watching and seeing the play. Acting is a great thing it opens people up. I enjoy it because you can become sum one you arent because you just need to excape sometimes!
