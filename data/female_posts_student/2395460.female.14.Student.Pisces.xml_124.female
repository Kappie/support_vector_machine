By one local's account, on at least five occasions in the last year, keyless remotes all over town mysteriously stopped working for about 20 minutes each time. While those old-fashioned metal keys still work, some engines require the remote before they can be started as an additional safety measure.   Some people have heard that NASA satellites are involved, but the most likely culprit is the 300 ft. microwave tower, used by AT to coordinate long-distance and cell calls. The tower manager, Dave Clark, does say that on some occasions the tower sends out a different signal. Another tower employee says that the second type of signal is issued by the "government" but said he couldn't say more nor would he give his name.   Someone, please let  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan  know about this.   Read more from the  urlLink Washington Post  (registration required.)
