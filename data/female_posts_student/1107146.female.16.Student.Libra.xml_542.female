But, I think I know him a bit better than you do, Rosie, as does Abby, given she's actually talked to him before.  And since we both approve, I think it's ok.  Not only that, but I think I can judge for myself who is good enough for me.  But, if you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number, and you can see for yourself.  That might solve some things.  Then he can defend himself and I won't have to do it anymore.
