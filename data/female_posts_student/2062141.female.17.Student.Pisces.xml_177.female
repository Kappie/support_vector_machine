Then I'm going to go look for a job... sigh... I'm not sure whether I really want one or whether I'm completely dreading this step into adulthood. I do know one thing: I need money. I have 2 dollars on my credit card. 2. My car is almost empty shit I forgot about that I can't do anything today!!! Uh ohhh. Crapmuffin. I think my mom said something about taking me dress shopping later tonight but I'm not sure I should in case Ryan can't get us tickets. Well.. there's no harm in looking, right....? Crap I need money. I need money to make money. It's a vicious cycle. Oh yeah btw Ryan the Dave tickets are NOT sold out on Ticketmaster, you silly monkey, don't buy some $90 scalper ticket! Camping is still available too. Or you could just bunk with us! Lol. GAA I wish it was summer right now it's gonna be so great!!! Summer summer summer summer. Wow I hate school.
