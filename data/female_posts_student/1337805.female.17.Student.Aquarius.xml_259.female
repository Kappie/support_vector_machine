Went to a fantastic Chinese food place called Sampen. Mmmmm...so good. Missed getting cotten candy at Central Saanich days, which blew. But oh well.  Babysit tonight again, from 6 til midnight. Packed everything today too, is hard work. Finally managed to get the duffle bags done, and zipped up, and then one breaks. Ooooh joy >  Anyways! I'm leaving on the 2nd, early in the morning, then coming home at some time on the 9th. I'll be unpacking,washing, and repacking, have a dentist appointment on the 10th to fix my tooth, it's my 5 month with Nick on the 10th as well, and then Josie will be in town and around for the 11th and 12th. In addition, I'll be finishing up what needs to be done for camp, like programs and supplies, packing :P. Allllways packing. I leave for camp on the 13th in the afternoon, and come back in the afternoon of the 15th. Then I'm home for a while. Ever :P weeee!!  anyways, everyone else have a good few. Send me some emails, give me something to do when I get back. Ciao!
