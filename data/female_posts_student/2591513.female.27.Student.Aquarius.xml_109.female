I know I was super tired and just wanted to sleep straight through...but of course he is my husband, so I got up and stayed with him downstairs while he ate.  We talked a little bit and I heard a little bit about what he did there.  I really do love that man and miss him when he is gone.  I guess I don't realize it until he is gone and when he gets back.  I can tellw e have grown so much and matured in our thinking because we don't fight as much...gosh hardly...when we do fight it is because I am moody and that doesn't happen too often these days.  I just don't see the point in it anymore.  Being moody just messes up the day.  I have to deal with it.  Anyway...I was upset before I went to bed, but now I am better.  I will have to concentrate on what I have now....and what I have now is awesome.  I need to remember to never look back with regret but look back and remember the good times and remember that the bad times mad you stronger.  OH OH OH  We are going to go bowling today...WOOHOO!
