Ive been working out a lot and now my tummy, arms, and my should back muscle things hurt =/ Oh well..at least im getting in shape. I need to stop sitting around, eating all day. But i guess thats what ya do in summer when you have to sit at home. Thats why i kinda want school to start. So i only eat once a day and i walk and move more. And also to see my friends. Hey school starts in 5 days OMG! lol. Thats cool. Monday me n my family went to Khols and spent 200 dollars there. I bought 2 shirts, a new purse, earings, rings, some kickass underwear..and thats about it. Then we wnet out to eat. On Tuesday i had to get up early and me and nick went to get our schedules together. He stayed the same..but ive noticed that ive changed alot...=/ its wierd. But i did have fun seeing him. He was really funny. We blasted Ludacris and it was just real fun. We got our schedules and teh whole school is a mess! LOL. I guess everyone is gonna go to Gathering Grounds Friday around 8. Im gonna go from 8-11:30 probably with all my friends. EVERYONE GO SUPPORT PANKAKE! Nick is gonna drive me and everything =) im so glad we hang out now! He's great. Even though i found out he did alot of shit while he was dating me...its just so hard to believe it. I dunno if i want to date him again or not but i still have initial feelings for him..oh well, we'll just have to see where this takes us. I guess Brandy saw Amanda The First at school for schedules and ive been thinking that amanda hates me cuz she hasnt called me in 2 weeks...but she told brandy to tell me that she has been grounded off the phone, that she was sorry and shes not mad. So i guess were gonna continue with whatever. It was just so wierd. Cuz we were talking every night. We did alot at the attic and we "bonded" through everything. Then i dont hear from her at all for 2 weeks? it was just wierd. But im glad were cool now. I talked to Marlys but all she ever talks about is her BFF Chasity whom they had their fisrt experience togetehr the other night. I know that Marlys is in love with Chasity..i know..and that sucks but whatevr..what can you do? lol. And the other two hotties that ive been talking too..(their just my friends people) Marissa and Amanda Gregg. Thier awesome. But other than that..i still need to go to DDR with thomas, and Kyle. I have to make arrangments with Tony cuz im using his locker today. I guess me n nick will be closer this friday. Um.....tommorrow my dad is getting DENSERS! OMG lol. And my lil bro has to go pick up his schedule at VB. Yup..so i have to make all these plans cuz i need to have a blast in these last days of summer =(....i need some fun.and i need to hook up with someone =O   Well see what happens..   Later   love~amandaTheSecond      BOBBY OBVIOUS "someday"   "YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FELL FOR YOU, IF YOU DID YOU'D LOVE ME TOO! THERES ONLY ONE THING I HAVE TA SAY, I AM GONNA GET YOU SOMEDAY!"   My half-brother Cory(lives in Manchester) has a punk band called Bobby Obvious...this used to be me and the RTA's song. Only a few people know who the RTA is..but whatever.
