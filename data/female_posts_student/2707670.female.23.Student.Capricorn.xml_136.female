I seem to be attracting thirty something divorcees right now. Maybe its the bars I hang out in but I try to practice and they get mad. It just isn't fair. If they know you are practicing then they don't act the same but if they don't know they get mad when you don't want anything from them.Right now I am working with farmers in a workshop and I offered to help two gentlemen (old enough to be my dad). This onestarted asking questions like "are you an only child?"and "how many acres does your family farm?"Well I didn't know what was going on until his son came back. The dad was scoping me out for his son. It was pretty funny, but I am helping them for the next three days and this makes it more interesting for me. Especially since one of the professors helping told me those were the questions to ask any cutefarm boysthat I met. I could use this for practice but it brings dad into it and thats not always good. Its just kind of nice to meet someone born in the same decade as me!    My parents are moving in to the new house in Oklahoma today so I guess its official I am an Okie. I can't wait to make it down there but first I have to finish my stats class. I hate stats and itmay come down to manipulating my teacher to get an A. I guess you do what you have to do.
