After that I just walked around the garden center that was there too, boring.   Anyway tomorrow I'm going to town with Â£12 (such an awful lot, I know) which will at least be something a bit more interesting, my holidays have been rather boring so far.   Going on holiday in about a week (well, to dads house for a week first), to the Lake District then we're coming back here, then a week later going to Wales, hoping it won't be a boring holiday and that it doesn't rain, that'll really ruin things.
