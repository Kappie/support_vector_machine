If that wasn't enough to deter him from starting up the table saw, the sheets of rain were. The temperature dropped, the mountain was obscured by heavy clouds; it felt like December. Despite this, when Gavin woke from his long, premature nap, we suited up and headed for the swimming pool. The only fools in Kaneohe, we had the entire pool to ourselves, watched by a sullen, soggy lifeguard. We swam in the rain, Gavin learned to spit arcs of water at his father, and we played a short game of boundary-testing as Gavin determined just how fast he could run or jump before we warned him. Afterwards, I took the wee boy into the shower with me, and he leaned back into the hot water and said "Aaah!" with a look of bliss on his face as I rinsed his hair. Despite the rain, it was the perfect, private family outing. In the evening, Mike wrestled with his son and discovered that Gavin could execute a perfect tumble. Gymnastics, here we come! After a long afternoon, Gavin dropped into bed and was asleep before I was finished singing him the first song.  It would have been nice to sleep so soundly, myself, but it was not to be. At 3:00am, an ominous yowl from outside woke me. Gavin nursed contentedly in his sleep, binding me to the bed, so I elbowed Mike and asked him to stop the cat fight before it woke the neighbors. As he stepped outside to scare off the wild cats, Xebo escaped and made a run for the bushes. I detached myself and sent Mike back to bed as I took over the search for the rogue cat, and as I stood looking out at the brightly-lit parking lot, I thought to myself  Surely we don't need so many damned lights on in the middle of the night.  No sooner had the thought passed my mind, than the power went out. Doused in blackness, I gave up on finding the cat and went back to bed. The neighbors somehow sensed the blackout, and woke to screech about it and shine a flashlight out onto the parking lot. Several hours passed, I dropped slowly back into sleep. Suddenly, the fan came alive, and the stereo downstairs emitted a high volume serenade by Kermit the Frog. My mother yelped and thundered downstairs to turn it off, her alarm clock chattering loudly enough to cue Gavin to wake for the day. 5:00am. "No way," I said firmly, closing the bedroom door and popping the child onto my breast. He allowed himself to drift back into sleep for another hour and a half before scrambling out of bed to face the day. I groaned and followed.   Some day I will get 8 hours of sleep, I must believe that.
