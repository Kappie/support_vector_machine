It may not seem like a lot to some people but for the less inspired (as ourselves) it was quite a load. Well we were running down Boulevard and Amy looks at me and says "I dont feel so well." To make a long story short, Amy got sick and I had to check on her at the H.P. on 81. What a great summer nite! It was the best :).   Later my homies and my peeps!  ~*~Anna
