I've just been going on and on on instant messenger about how cool cheese is and how I want to buy some good quality cheese. I'm getting a job and I'm looking forward to buying cheese. I'm also making an effort to become obsessed with buying comic books. This is like trying to get addicted to cigarettes. I'm really happy with all my weirdness, but it just seemed worth noting. This way, when I'm carted off to the loony bin, there'll be some documentation of what drove me over the edge. I've also been spelling out words in sign language while walking down the hall at school. It's the less crazy equivalent of talking to myself in public. What would a shrink say about this? Cry for attention? Irreparable psychosis? I hope it's both.   My birthday passed on the eighth without much fuss. On the day itself I wanted to type up an in-depth analysis of every event, but I was pretty depressed at the time so I mostly just wanted to figure out exactly what happened to make me feel bad so I could have some justification for righteous anger. I did see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  though, and dude? Best. Movie. Ever. Seriously. It rocked my world. Occasionally I get these pure moments of euphoria, like unadulterated happiness, and I got one at the end of the movie. While that might have been as much hormones as movie quality, you should still see it.   I started this thing at a funny time in my life. A lot of the things I mention, however briefly (going to the gym, flirting with boys, whatever), may sound casual, but would have been considered a significant 'wow' kind of thing a few months ago. Things are changing. I can feel them changing. I spent basically my entire pre-high school life being afraid. I can't express how afraid I was. One of my earliest memories is of worrying that my kindergarten class would hate me because I got some privilege they missed out on. Throughout middle school I walked head down, close to the wall, the tall girl who was full of shame. I'm not saying that that's entirely disappeared, or that I was the only one who ever felt like that. It's just that now that's been significantly reduced, and I'm glad. I can talk to people and enjoy it. I can flirt, and have done so on two separate occasions to date (baby steps- don't scoff). I can actually clean my room- yes, this was a huge struggle for me just a little while ago. I'm doing my homework. I'm actually having a life. Kind of.   Note- The first two paragraphs of this entry are from a draft I made on the eleventh.
