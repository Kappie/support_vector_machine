Some like "ROAR" I felt were too angry for my happy life. Others, like "Smiley" I felt were, well, a bit too  hippieish  for my liking. One, however, i liked very much- "I Like Big Butts". But... I was afraid some of you "more serious people of the world" wouldn't exactly find the humor in it or get the joke. So I had to turn it down. However I appreciate the suggestion and the thought that went into it. So have a funny day!      Live a Little!
