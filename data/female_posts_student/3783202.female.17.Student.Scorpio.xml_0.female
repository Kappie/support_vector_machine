And it seems like almost EVERY time I turn on the radio or changee the station, The Reason seems to come on. It scares me, It's either that or a song that reminds me of him. I miss him. and It's sad because I keep wondering to myself am I supposed to miss him this much? Does he miss me, is he thinking about me? These thoughts seem to consume my mind and I wish they didn't because whatever I think and feel is usually the complete opposite of what is real. I have to wonder how he can say such amazing things to me and be with her(which I think he is, and most likely is) And if he and I are just friends and that's it hwo can he say those things when he knows that I know how they're going to affect me. He said that he felt something between us, again I'm repeating myself, but just make sure that I heard myself the first time. Is what I'm thinking all in my head? That he's with her and he and I could never be. He said he wants a long term relationship, so what was I, a "fling" of some sort? That's what I want more than anything. To be with somebody. And I don't mean like hey the first guy that I see I want to be like I want to be in the big extravagant reltionship with. There was a point in time where I could have seen myself with Nate. And then I actaully thought about it and I realized What the hell was I thinking? Nate could never commit to a girl. Speaking of Nate, he called me last night at god damned 230 in the morning, I was like Oh my God you have to be kidding me! but anyways on with my bitching....Am I obsessing over this or am I the most parinoid person on the planet? I want to be with Brent, and I know that. But the whole one sided and other girl thing is kind of a problem, yeahhhh. I have to wonder sometimes if he takes me seriously. i think he thinks I'm this huge flirt and can't be with one guy, so the female version of Nate. Which completely isn't true. I know that Brent and I aren't tgether, but Nate came over one night a few nights ago and we kissed and I felt guilty, and I don't know why. I felt like I was cheating on Brent because the whole time that Nate and I were sitting outside that's all I kept thinking about, and this was before he left for Germany. What the hell is wrong with me. WHY AM I THINKING AND FEELING LIKE THIS? I seriously wish that I could forget all about it. Not him just about the situatuon for a while. Dustin  a different one, not Doug's Dustin, he's in one of my summer school classes asked me out and I hesistated to say yes, seriously. Why do I feeling bad, or guilty.  The smell of chlorine seems to be over taking me so off to the shower I go...WOO HOO...OOO More later oh and  I saw Andrea today, but that's another drama department w'll save for later.
