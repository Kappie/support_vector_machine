The month view is located here: http://www.livejournal.com/view/?type=month=exampleusername. It is also linked from each of the month blocks on the Calendar page. If you are looking for a particular entry, this is often the best way to locate it, particularly if you remember the subject you used for that entry.   Links to posts in a non-current year are shown in the Calendar view. They can also be reached by appending a specific year onto the end of the Calendar view URL (such as http://www.livejournal.com/users/exampleusername/yyyy/).   In all examples given in this FAQ, replace 'exampleusername' with the username of the user whose Calendar view you wish to read."
