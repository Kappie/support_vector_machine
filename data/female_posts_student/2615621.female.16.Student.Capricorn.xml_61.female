Him and Derek are the only ones i remember seeing, even though i know i saw the bi dude..haha and i dont remember the girl...lol umm...maybe cuz DEREK is hot. haha   Today i took 2 exams...ugh. Honors World History, which took me a whole freakin 10mins. seriously. haha i was the first one done and i was like..whoa now, should i look back over my answers? so i checked random ones to make sure i didnt loose my place when marking answers or anything, all good..turned it in..only stared 3 that i kinda knew...so i made maybe a 97. haha it was so easy. Trevor took 15mins..usually he takes the whole damn day. i was proud. haha I then took my Spanish 2 exam and i made a 95 on it..now, this is the same class i had a 57 in and then with many smiles and nice words pulled it up to a 98...but pani thinking that its not far, it got pulled back down to a 91...oh well, i made a 95 on the exam! haha YAY! even though my overall for the class will be an 80 because of the past grades..u know those 72's...haha   My knee surgry is now going to be on Aug. 2nd. yay. before school starts, that gives me about a little over a week i think to recover and get off those stupid ass crutches, im not doing crutches again at school...if i have to, it will be the 3rd time ive had to use them at school in the last 4 years. no way. lol no more please!! especially with all those damn stairs, at least the middle school didnt have stairs.   After my exams i went to my mom's school to sit in on her last art class of the day. It was a 5th grade class and they were doing self-portraits. My mom handed me a paper called the "Big Head", which is a paper with this rather large head pre-drawn for you. You find the marks where to put your eyes, mouth, nose, ears, ect. I was made to do one. As i did mine i was thinking "wow this looks pretty good..." haha It was actually a lovely picture, seeing the source haha i cant draw. I laid down my pencil and crayons and looked at my masterpiece but only to see how depressed it looked. It really got to me. I swear if i was in my room drawing that i would have started crying. It looked so damn depressd! "I" wasnt even smiling! Well, because i couldnt master the smiling lips very well..haha i told my mom "I" looked depressed so she put some lines under my eyes to "change the expression" whatever, i still looked at "me" and saw a depressed face. Then again, i am leaving all summer and i'm going to be without my friends...maybe i am somewhat distressed. not depressed...but i dont know..saddened maybe. Oh and i almost hit the mailman when i was driving...haha   It's a beautiful day!!! People are going to grad. tomorrow night and then to see the movie The Day After Tomorrow. Part of me wants to go since i will be leaving saturday, but then part of me doesnt. I dont know why i dont want to go...i mean, come on now julia, you'll be leaving and now heres a chance to go see a movie you WANT to see and CANT wait to see with your FRIENDS...i dont know how to explain that one. Maybe i dont want to go to grad. Part of me does...but the other part doesnt really wanna sit there and watch people go away. Maybe im just being a stupid bitch stick in the mud. haha I'll prob go anyways...make myself go, knowing i'll regret it if i dont...but i'll have to totally haul ass to pack and clean my room, because if my room isnt clean by the time i leave my mom is going to clean it. That means she'll read every note and evey paper under my bed. I dont know if i really want that. haha no telling what i've hidden in my room i have forgotten about...  THE SUN WOKE THE WHOLE STATE by LIMBECK  Thanks for the ride to the airport.  My head got stuck out the window.  And it felt so good cause I’ve never had that kind of luck on the way home.  When I got out, you were there knockin’ on the front door.  The cold gets in the things you wear.  It’s so good it’s that time again.   Thanks for stopping by the river so I could run to take it.  Of all these days we wake, here is one to remember: the first day of October.   It don’t mean much.  We never had a chance.  We’re out of touch.  The space between us spells it out.  I like that song, im actually listening to it. I was listening to old burned cds i made back when i first got a cd burner (oooo ahhhh hahaha) and i found a song called Tennessee. Heres some bits and pieces. It's by Marcel, hes an "ok" new singer. hes a pop/country mix.   It's a Sunday morning, lying awake, It's just another lonely day, I lie in bed and wonder, How long it's gonna take Then I think to myself, Will I ever get a break, Did I make a big mistake, If you need me, burn it up, Bend the rules leave right away, If you need me take a four lane, Headed my way, Take a bus, take a plane, Take a car, take a train, Take a bike, hitch a ride, you decide, If you need me you know where I'll be, In Tennessee  Kinda a stupid cheesy song...but it reminded me of leaving, and im going to TN..how weird. hahaha    It's not always rainbows and butterflies...
