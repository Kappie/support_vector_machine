Now that I think about it, I don't really know why I like it...mostly, I just do. It really takes a special appreciation to be able to listen to it and enjoy it. Everyone, on some level of consciousness or another, knows that all it really is is a big wall of sound, some guy screaming until his vocal cords collapse, blaring guitars founded on the same three or four power chords (differently arranged for each song, of course, we need to look like musicians), drums...well...they're insanely fast, some bands, like Nile, you can't really tell they're actually keeping time, it sounds like he's just nailing the fuck out of the closest skin he can get to.   But still, I guess it preaches to those wonderful unconscious aggressions we try so hard to keep to ourselves. Perhaps our enjoying it is a facet of our expressing said aggressions in a passive way. Mostly all the real dmetal listeners I know are pretty placid with the world, since they purge the aggression each time they press the play button.  Just a little philosophical rant that had occurred to me on some level today. Peace, everyone.  And if you talk to me before, say, the beginning of next week, don't make fun of me. I sound stoned/really really old.
