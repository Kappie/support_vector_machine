The Captain and I were speaking th eother day and he asked me what day it was and I didn't have a clue. Literally no idea what day of the week it is.  It's irevlevant here.  We work everyday so it's not we are looking forward to a weekend.   Last night was fun. I was invited to the greek bar-b-que on Deck 4 Aft. My friend Fotis came and picked me up from my office and took me there. I got there around 9:30ish and when I arrived there was tons of food, lots of beer and all of the senior officers. I was one of 4 girls there. We sat there, talked and drank for a couple of hours. The greek officer danced a lot and I sat there making fun of them. It was a blast. After we all went to the crew bar for a bit and I hung out with my German friend, Felix. I am learning lots of greek words and some german because of my friends on board. I go for my daily "greek" lesson every afternoon. My friend Zoe gives me four new words a day, 3 good and 1 bad. Hehehehe. I am learning slowly, which I guess is the best way.   Tonight is formal. Again. I am so tired today. These people are killing me. I need lots of sleep sleep sleep. All I see are Z's right now.
