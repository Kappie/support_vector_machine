"You won't be able to save Andolin if you're caught as well."  "Andolin was caught," he rose to his feet and swiped off the dirt, "by who?  The sheriff here's an idiot."  "Believe it or not, it was the sheriff.  However, he wasn't using normal tactics."  "Huh...?"  Briar didn't get the hidden meaning.  "He used dark magic, a very powerful type."  "Okay, now I know you're lying.  Hood couldn't cast a spell let alone a line."  "I would have said the same thing, if I was just a human by-stander, but I'm an elf with a keen eye for magic. He was muttering a curse under his breath."  "Why am I listening to this crap?  I don't know you, nor do I care to know you.  I'll be going now."  He started walking out of the alley, but was stopped by a blonde female.  "Don't you want to save your friend?  I know Pathen does," she said.  The first thing Briar noticed about this girl was that she was not an elf, but a human.  She had golden hair that hung tied behind her ears.  "Who are you and why are you in my way?"  "I'm Kiri, Pathen's partner."  "Who's Pathen?"  "You were just talking to him," she gave a general gesture to the direction of the Westerner.  "Why are you two so interested in my partner?"  "He has his personal reason, don't you Pathen?  I don't really know, but I'll go along."  "Personal reason, what did she take something from you and you want your own revenge?"  Briar sneered.  "She's my fiance,"  Pathen responded frankly.  "Andolin's got a fiance?!" Briar yelled.  "Yes."  "She never told me," he pointed out.  "Our engagement isn't in the approval of The Guild.  That is the only reason she is your accomplice," Andy's fiance responed.  "Now you've got my attention.  So, how are we supposed to save her."
