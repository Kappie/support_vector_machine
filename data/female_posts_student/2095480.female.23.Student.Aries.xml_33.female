JANE  Resists, Challenges, Maintains and Transforms Patriarchy"  will be in  VSU's undergraduate research journal . Cool huh? If you actually want to read it, give me a shout... its too long to clutter blogger with.    Wind Ensemble  played well last night, props to those of you in it. Got to go out with  Miranda  afterwards (thx girlie! I needed to hang-out!). Congrats to new SAI officers.   Anyway,  Jarrett  wrote the following for a class of his... and I thought it was interesting... so here it goes...  ~~~~~~  Morality is relative. There is no universal law of morality that governs the land. There is, however, a basic human right to LIVE and to LIVE the way they want.   You must be taught morality from the time you're a small child. Aside from learning the morals and ethics of society, you must learn to respect the morals of OTHER societies as well.   It is the job of the people to question the moralities of the time. Is what they do truly just? Are there standards that are being met, or aren't being met? If there needs to be a change in the society in which you live, then push forth the change. If you have lived in that society, in that moral structure, and understand it well and feel it is unjust, then it is reasonable, logical, and moral to push for a change to the better.   However, it is wrong to go to a different place to try to change them. For instance, our coming to the Americas and forcing the Indians to change, our going to Hawaii to "give God to the Heathens!" and stuff like that. They're not heathens for believing what they want to believe, and have believed for thousands of years. It is not our place to say the way they think is WRONG.   The moral, legal, and human rights of an individual may not be levied at any time. They have the right to live, unless some fault of theirs, whether morally or legally, has caused otherwise. (IE: Murder.)  ~~~~~
