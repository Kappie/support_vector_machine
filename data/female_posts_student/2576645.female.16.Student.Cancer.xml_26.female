Well, we haven't quite figured out the legistics yet, but we definately have a kick ass band name. 'A Stroke of a Genius'. Yup...we got the name...now we just need the talent.  Actually..... who needs the talent aspect? A lot of famous people coast thru life on their good looks and good managment, and wind up on the covers of movies, cds and magazines. (i.e. the Olsens, Hilary Duff and Frankie Muniz)   Unfortunatly I don't have good looks or good managment so this might be an obstacle.  But to quote a famous 60s black suffrage song...."We shall overcome...."
