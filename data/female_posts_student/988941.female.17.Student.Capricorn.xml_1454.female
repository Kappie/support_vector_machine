Now, this means that as I run it (not that there is alot to do) I just try and keep people blogging. Thats basically all I do. I could've quite easily deleted yours and Toms posts and left it blank or I could've edited them but I didn't. Instead I left you both a message trying to stop an argument escalating which is what it seemed like and instead you turn around and start yelling at me. I do not appreciate that especially after I invited you back a second time to rejoin El Bloggo. Now if you want to discuss this any further email, msn or phone me. I am sure no one else wants to read which is most likely plastered as a petty argument. Enough.  Hi Andy, glad you could join. If anyone wants to Andy Mr Woodcock here was the cause of a HUGE queue in Woolies today. He didn't have enough money so ran out to get some (this is the second time this has happened) and caused a great big queue. Tutt tutt. Lol. Silly boy. But you do keep us amused. Yea work wasn't that great as I wasn't in the best of moods. I ended up realphabetising the drawers as some people can't spell properly and keep putting the cd's in the wrong places. Gah. No big dramas. All day tomorrow. Off to Croydon now to buy a PC game and to say hi to Paul. Have a nice day ya'll.
