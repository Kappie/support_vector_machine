Teh conversation stoped "Yes to Mordor" I heared Gandalf say with a continuce of shadowey words here and there. I could not catch them all. Dark Power, Ring, whispering, adn so forth. Frodo questiong what he was to do, and Deserving it? Ducked below the widowI finally got in something that was what i was looking for. THere was a talk of him not going alone an d Mr Underhill, and a companion.OUt of nowwhere cam an arm, i dashed but it had my ear. Gandalf. Well well bless my beared ,he said, now what may yjou be doing?
