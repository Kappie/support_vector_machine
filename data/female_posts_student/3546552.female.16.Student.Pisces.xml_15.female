After making our chocolate chip pancakes, both Sarah and Amanda left and I had to clean the entire house myself, sleeping bags, dishes, food and all. So that took hours. Then after that, I raced off to Worship team practice which was fine. I talked to two very special people there...hehe...After that I went over to the Cameron house to watch  You Drive Me Crazy  with Lindsey, Ashley and Andrew. The movie was cute and I was having a great day until I came home and my mom almost blew up at me for being a little late.  Sometimes, I really hate my life. It's summer, shouldn't I be able to stay up, and do some fun things with my friends? O well, hopefully I won't get anymore crap in the morning. I just wanna go and cry myself to sleep. The only thing that was good today, was that I got to see two of my favorite people in the world. One can make me laugh and finish all my sentences, and the other, well...yeah. Youth Group should be good tomorrow, but I really hope all my stupid issues will disappear by then so I can enjoy worhip and have no distractions. Goodnight.
