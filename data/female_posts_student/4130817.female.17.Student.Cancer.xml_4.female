I did not accomplish anything that I wanted to this summer. I had so many goals set and they just all slipped away, but oh well what can I do now. I just set my goals for the last year of highschool. I dont know about anyone else but i am kind of freakin out about this being the last year. Moving away actually having to pay for school but I guess that will pass. After this year it is off the the real world. Laters for now. ~ashley~
