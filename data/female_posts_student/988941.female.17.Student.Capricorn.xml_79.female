Max your outta order i neva said you could tell anyone bout wot i said and that is why i didnt say anything to anyone else. 3.Im really pissed off today 4.Im not gonna tell anyone anything about how or feel or whats up with me from now on cause it will end up somewhere like an email inbox 5.Is life worth living? Is Ilife worth being born? Is it worth me being around? 6. No one cares about me and i wish i wasnt here
