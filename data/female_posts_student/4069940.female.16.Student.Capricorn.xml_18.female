Now, sweet, they are going to have a blast in the sun, and hang out with each other, and be bestest friends, like any church family should do.  But you see, normally, I am joining them.  It is very rarley that I don't go along on a church trip, and everytime I have ever turned one down, it has been simply because, for one reason or another, I was not able to make it without a conflicting event.  Well, this time, I am not going.  I'm staying here in Roseburg, because I can not longer be around that youth group for extended periods of time.  Earlier this summer, I went on a two week trip to Mexico and Yosemite with this same youth group.  It was a blast.  I had the best time in the world.  However, many things happened on this trip that really bugged me, that I never took time to think about until I was reflecting on the trip later.  I don't want this to be something that seems like all I ever do is bring others down, but I guess it is where I vent, and if you don't want me to, don't read it.  So, a few things that happened, on this trip, really made me mad.  One, pretty much every guy under 18, including the "leaders" were so comsumed with the girls, the whole time.  We talked about this in my cabin more than a few times, how we felt like the focus of the trip was on hormones and not God.  Ok, so they are teenage boys, that is just what the spend most of their time on, girls, but NOT when you are on a mission trip.  I will say that I also spent time focused on other things than God, but they were constantly thinking about it, and you could tell.  Two, it seemed to some of us, that the only thing anyone cared about were the team relationships.  Sweet, relationships are a huge part of a two week mission, because when you spend two sraight weeks with the same people, you have a tendancy to learn EVERYTHING about everyone, but you don't have to make it bigger than the actual projects.  It was good that we were able to work well together and get along, but it was not as focused as it could have been.  So, why am I not going on a trip that everyone told me to?  Lake Shasta is a beautiful place, and I really enjoy all the time I spend there.  I don't want to ruin that by going with people who can't seem to focus on anything but girls and popularity.  So is that wrong?  Is it wrong that I can't go to my church and feel comfortable?  No.  It's not worng, to them anyway.  It's just REALLY, REALLY sad.
