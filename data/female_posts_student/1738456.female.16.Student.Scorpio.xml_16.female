However, being angry was taking a toll on me, and I was wearing myself out by walking so quickly.   Soon I found a pond near a tree, so I decided to sit down to catch my breath. That’s when I noticed that everything had grown smaller the as I walked away from it. I could now pick a flower and put it in my hair, instead of leaning on it. The furry gray cat I had run into earlier jumped into my lap, and I laughed stroking it gently.  “Hello kitty kitty, how are you?” I asked it, fully expecting a response. This time, none came. “What’s the matter kitty? Don’t you like me?” I picked him up and turned him so his eyes looked into mine. The cat blinked slowly, and then yawned. I set him down, and he ran off. It looked as if I had finally found a normal creature in this nightmarish wonderland of sorts.  Leaning over to get a drink out of the pond, I noticed my reflection had changed. My hair wasn’t just hanging down my back anymore. Somehow, it had managed to get itself into two braids. My bangs hung down in my eyes, and I quickly felt my head to see if what I was seeing was true. My hair had changed, but the girl in the pond didn’t. She didn’t seem to move when I did.  “Hey, aren’t you supposed to be my reflection?” I spouted quickly.  “Aren’t you supposed to be doing an English paper?” She responded. I sucked in air, and stared down in bewilderment. “Don’t do that,” she said, “You look horrible when you bug out your eyes like that, put them back into your head like a normal girl.” I blinked and stared at her, and then I saw the Prince next to me.  “It tells you things you know,” he said. His reflection’s mouth didn’t move, but instead nodded when he was done talking. I looked up at him. He was back in his formals, and he handed me a yellow flower. I smiled bashfully and thanked him.  “You’re running out of time girly,” said my reflection.  “I am?” I said shocked.  “Yes you are.”  “Well how was I supposed to know? My watch isn’t working!” I shoved out my wrist and showed her the swirling hands. She leaned forward and stared for a second.  “It seems to be working just fine,” she crossed her arms. I looked at my watch. It now showed the time to be 11:35. I had ten minutes to kiss the person I loved, or I would become like Bob somehow. Who did I love? Why had my watch started working just now? How was I going to get out of all this? Nothing made any sense to me. Not even when I thought about it all backwards.  The Prince’s reflection leaned in and whispered to me, “He might love you; you’re the only one here that is just pretty as he is.”  “Thank you,” my reflection turned and said to him. I looked up at the Prince, who was currently trying to climb up the tree to get a pear. I laughed at him. He had no idea how to get up it. He was completely spoiled by his royalty.  “Can I help you?” I asked him.  “No I’m fine just hang on to something,” he said.  “What do you mean hang on?” He stood for a second with his hands on his hips, and then shook his head disbelievingly. Then the world flipped on me. I screamed and reached for the thing nearest to me to keep from falling up into the sky. I caught myself on the branch and looked up. The pond was there in perfect shape. Not a drop had fallen out, but my reflection had disappeared.  The Prince kept his balance, and then walked on the branch over to the edge. He picked the pear he wanted and then jumped back down. The world flipped again, and I swung around so that my feet were facing the ground.  “A little help?” I asked the Prince, who sat cross-legged biting into his juicy pear.  “Sure,” he said, and ran over to where I was. He opened his arms, “Let go of the branch, I’ll catch you.”  “You promise?” I asked too scared to even look down.   “I swear I won’t let you hit the ground. I didn’t want to stay up there forever, but I wasn’t sure if I trusted him. So not sure if he would catch me, I closed my eyes and let go. Somehow, in my head it made sense that if I couldn’t see what happened, I wouldn’t get hurt. Nonsense of course, but something told me in a place where up could suddenly become down, that I was right.
