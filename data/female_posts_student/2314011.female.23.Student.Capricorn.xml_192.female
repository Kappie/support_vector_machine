Needed the sleep-time after another late-night conversation.  We love communication, especially when it leads to new places.    And so, we come to Friday.  The big boss is gone and I can already feel a lazy day taking shape.  Been here for more than a few minutes and have yet to start working.  Reading The Boy's big blog and talking to the fans mulling through the office takes a while!
