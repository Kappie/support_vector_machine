I'm always a friend he could lean on but I don't know if he'll ever be like that towards me. Last night I found out that he told my friend that I'm stupid, actually not directly, he said that due to "my" mistake in the lab, where I accidentally fell the cover of the crucible and he got pissed because of it. Even I got pissed with his reaction but "I" thought that things were already ok between us since we're already "sort-of" talking inside the classroom. It never occur to me that he would say anything as rude as what I just heard from him but unfortunately he could. It truly got through me and I don't know why. Then just now we were talking through text and just like that I forgive him! I was even asking him if he's okay and I'm willing to listen to his problem but once again I'm not good enough so he made a fool out of me by making a false problem and, accorrding to my judgment, he actually finds it funny. But guess what?? IT"S NOT! I couldn't get myself to be angry with him, maybe because I'm scared of screwing things between us, I mean we are in the stage where friendship between us might actually happen (or at least I think it's possible) Anyway, I don't know how I should be with him I'm torn between the "mataray" cynic Hannah or the sweet, caring friend side of me. Ha! Why does it have to happen to me???   :c
