We had to get plain curtains for the window, because we weren't willing to pay $60 for the curtains we actually wanted from Linens n Things. On a different note, we got towels at Kohls for very cheap. Just thought that those of you that need anything new may wanna know... 'cause Kohls is having a sale til Sunday where select things are 50-60% off. Anyhow... okay, that's really all I've got. The only things I've done this week are paint and work. Tomorrow's a full day too... possible trip to Kerrville for something and then lots of laundry and I need to wash the stinky dog. So... yeah... ta ta.
