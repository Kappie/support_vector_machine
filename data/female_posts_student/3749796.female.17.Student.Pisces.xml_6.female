Just yesterday, I met Mr Law ( Sec4 PE teacher)and guess what, he recongise me! Haha! Feeling good that someone remember me,maybe not my name, but my face! Then on the other side of the MRT station, I met Safiah... She doing quite okay now... And i really hope that she's feeling good...  That's all for now... Need to rush for project le!
