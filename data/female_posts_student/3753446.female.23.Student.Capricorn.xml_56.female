The shelf boards are over, which means first year is over, which means I can comfortably start my summer break now...for the next ten days! Its definitely a short vacation but I'm planning to live it up.  Today started things off well. I went to Rally for the Ramp (the new exit ramp to OSU off 315) right after the test and checked out some cute construction barrels dressed as OSU cheerleaders and hospital patients. Yes, I said dressed. I've never explored an exit ramp on foot before, so for the short time I was there, it was worth it. The afternoon was spent running several errands that I've been putting off, including turning in my biostats homework and dropping off dry cleaning, among others. And then I hit the mall. I really enjoy shopping at the mall on my own. Its fun with friends as well, but then I rarely am as productive or scrutinizing a shopper as when I go on my own. So I did spend a good hunk of change today, but I'm proud to say I did not dip into the vacation budget. I'll address that in a minute. The rest of the day was really relaxing. I worked out and went to a barbecue at Tendy's condo. Then I went to Dave and Buster's for the Ruthann/Aaron/Sanjida one-year anniversary celebration. From there we grabbed Donny and went to Long Street. It has been SOO long since I've gone out dancing. Tonight was a lot of fun though. They were having a foam party!! I'd never been to one of those before, so of course I grabbed Donny and we dove right in. It was pretty amazing how much foam they made out of these barrels, and it was sooo much fun to fight with. We all got soaked. And of course in the meantime there was some good music to dance to. Altogether, though I took three showers in one day (morning, workout, and post-foam), it was a fun evening. And I'm so clean you could eat off me. ;)  So anyway, the vacation I referred to earlier? 8 days 7 nights in New York City (including 2 days and 1 night in Philly). AWWWW YEEEAH BABY. I cannot WAIT to get outta this city and see people who have nothing to do with school or research or medicine. Altogether I'll be seeing Nina, Raquib, my mom's sister and my cousins, Rohini (YAY!! she's spending half the week with me), my dad's sister and those cousins, Shareef, and of course Aaron and Nate. Its amazing that I'm going to see Aaron on this trip. We practically have the same brain as it is, and the one time we take vacations from school that are not school-related we still wind up in the same place. Ah the irony. I am sure it will be a lot of fun. So anyway, I'm superexcited to see all these friends and relatives, and of course to spend time exploring the city with Ro. I've been to New York several times before, but as anyone who's been there knows, there's always more to see and do out there. And exploring is always so much more fun with someone else who shares your brain (Rohini and I ALSO have the same brain). :)  As for how I did on the exam, a few people have asked, I won't know my scores for a while but the three exam sections were definitely not easy. I did my best though so its out of mind for the moment. Becky's right though, I have a definite history of not giving myself enough credit when its due. The biochem section actually did turn out to be my favorite section. Yeah baby, my degree was worth something after all!  Well thats all for the evening. This is the latest I've been up in ages! Gnight!
