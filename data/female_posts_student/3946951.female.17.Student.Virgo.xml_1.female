Three-quarters of a year ago, it was my seventeenth birthday. I was at Olive Garden and the nice waitress gave me a free slice of cake of my choice. I believe I chose the lemon cake—its official name I do not recall—but I know I chose lemon because I have a huge thing for citrus-flavored foods. Someone told me that Olive Garden is the McDonald’s of all the Americanized Italian restaurants—but that isn’t of importance.      What’s important is that I was sitting there with my family and newly found adult friends (please do not ask why these new “friends” of mine are adults, as I do not want this piece of writing to get very long), and that slice of cake was staring up at me. The candle had flickered like a miniature, pocket-sized firework, and as tradition goes, I was told to make a wish and blow out those fireworks.      I didn’t make a wish. I was more eager for the cake than I was for any tradition.        Yet I suppose that while I was eating the cake—the cake was good, though it could have been better with coffee—I knew that deep down inside, I wanted nothing more than happiness. That is, after all, what wishes all come down to, right? Nobody makes a wish for their own misfortune or grief. That would be stupid and very much ridiculous.      Well three-quarters of a year later, I am sitting on top of my grandmother’s bed with an extremely slow laptop on my lap, wondering if, in the past three-quarters of a year, my wish had come true. Am I truly happy?       School is over and I graduated my junior year, passing my Language Arts class with an 89.5. I hate decimals. And I hate 89s. I also hate classes that teach you writing. Writing, to me, is a form of expression, not a form of rules and regulations.      And it has almost been a full year since my parents’ divorce and my adjusting to the huge changes in my life. I moved to a different state, leaving behind the small Texas hometown that I grew up in, as well as the people that I grew up with. I lost my best friend. I haven’t seen my dad in months. In my new, rented house, I share a room with my grandmother, who snores the way a person passes bad gas. I don’t have a driver’s license yet, and I’m too scared of my new neighborhood to ride the bus all by myself. …I don’t think girls should ride public buses by themselves. I know a girl who did. The story wasn’t pretty.       And yet with all these concerns and with all the impediments that seem to block my path to happiness, I suppose I cannot complain. There were still the times when I smiled and appreciated the good term called life. In that perspective, I am happy. Whether I am or not, however, I still think back to three-quarters of a year ago and recall that that lemon cake tasted good—very good, actually.    It just needed the coffee.
