I just got back from the last night of band camp.. im so glad! everyones parents came and whatched us march n play and amanda malone was there i havnt talked to her or seen her in forever except for when i told her i hated her bc she wasnt doing band lol.. i was jm tho. after we played the songs through we went inside and i talked to amanda ryan she was a senior last year she is such a sweet heart ! i dont want her to go to college bc then i won't see her any more :-( she talked to me about band and stuff and shes like don't worry bout dr. hanzlik if it makes u feel better mike got yelled at when he was a freshman too.. so i guess that made me feel a little better! i love all the older ppl in the band they are soo nice to us freshman they're awesome! i think this years going to be so funn except for dr. hanzlik i guess hes okay, but i wish he would lighten up a little bit  i doubt thats going to happen tho.
