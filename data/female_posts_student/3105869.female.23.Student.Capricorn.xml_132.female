"The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that's the essence of inhumanity."    "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."    "Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity for experience."    "Americans adore me and will go on adoring me until I say something nice about them."    "If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable must Man be of learning from experience."    "We don't bother much about dress and manners in England, because as a nation we don't dress well and we've no manners."    "When a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty."    "There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it."     Here's my Fav John Donne:    No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.  John Donne, Meditation XVI
