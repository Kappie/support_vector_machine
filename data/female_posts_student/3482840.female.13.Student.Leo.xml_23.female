I finally got out and into out own house. What are ppl gonna think when they find out I'm living w/ grams again? I don't even wanna think about it.   There's not much else going on. I was just @ Heather's. We made reallly cute earrings! Not that either of us can wear them but still! Yeah well, I'm gonna make grilled cheese. Or as the rainbow-folk would say, 'toasted cheese sandwiches'. *lol* Only kidding! L8tr peeps!
