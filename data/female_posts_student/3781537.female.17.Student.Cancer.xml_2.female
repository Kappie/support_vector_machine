It would have been rockin awesome if faith would have went on tour with him, she would have been fun to see :)! GOTTA HAVE FAITH! anywayz .. so now i am listening to Reba, shes awesome and i love her. If and when she comes to St. Louis i am def going to that one. I want to see Alanis when she comes with barenaked ladies, but i will be in virginia beach :( . I was halfway lookin forward to Alanis coming. oh well. Amy is going out of town tomorrow .. only for a few days but she will be missed, not just by me of course. I dont know what i am going to do for those days, everyone usually congregates at Amys but she wont be here. I'll find something to do. My b-day is Tuesday, the 13th. I am way excited. I will finally be 17 .. yayyy!! I cant wait til amy and i go to connecticut .. a week from today. I love going up there .... if i could live anywhere i would choose ridgefield connecticut, because i think its so beautiful. anywayz .. i am going to finish my Reba and find something on the internet that will interest me for awhile.
