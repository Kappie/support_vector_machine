Anyways (technically 'anyways' isn't a word, it is supposed to be 'anyway' but nobody ever says that)....as I was starting to say...back to my day! It wasn't really that eventful. I dunno, I can't say I was in a bad mood, because that wouldn't be true. But then again, to certain people I wasn't in a good mood either. I guess I was fine, but there were just some parts of the day where I was getting tired of certain people. I kinda got mad at them easily, but oh well. Nothing I can do about it now, so I might as well get over it. Lets see....the highlight of my day..hmm..that would prolly have to be my psychology class. I dunno, that was the class that I had the most fun in today, so I can't really pick a specific thing. I need someone to rant to...well maybe not. Maybe I should just keep it to myself. I dunno, I tend to do that a lot--keep things inside. It's probably not the best thing to do, but I don't think I trust people enough to tell them what I'm completely thinking all the time. I mean, sometimes I do it, but not too often. And when I do, it's usually after I've hit the breaking point. I dunno....I should deal with emotions in a better way. It's weird tho, I always feel like I can best tell people my emotions once they've been completely honest with me. It's like something they need to earn....haha. I dunno, I'm just rambling now. I think that's enough for now....I need to talk to someone or I'm gonna die. haha. I guess that's what I get for not talking much during the day...oh well.
