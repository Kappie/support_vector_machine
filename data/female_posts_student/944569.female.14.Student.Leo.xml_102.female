It was Earth.  Her voice was so full of agony and writhing in pain that Sky returned to her side immediately.  Tears were coursing down her cheeks and her words were laced with sadness and pain. “  It hurts,” She whispered while weeping, “ They’ve cut my proud trees, chopped down my fine green hair.  They’ve killed my children.  They’ve poured a vile liquid over my skin.  They’ve thrown their waste into my tears.  Why?  Why?  Stay away from me, beloved.  I am hideous.” Sky soothed her tears and promised to stay with her forever.  He embraced her and wrapped his arms around her body.  He would wait with her and share her pain until They left.  When She could choose, when Her children were reborn.  That was when they would cease to wait.  He cried with her at times.  His tears of pure love vanished into her flesh and helped her bear the pain.  The stars and drops of rain were his sparkling tears.  They would stay together until the end.  Their love was only pure.
