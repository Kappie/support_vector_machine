To many Senator fans, they are probably glad that Bonk, notorious for not showing up and having size but doing nothing with it, has had at least some return, but like myself, a little queasy about the fact that he'll stay in our division. He is not a no. 1 centreman, sucks at face-offs and disappears in the playoffs and in the end, I'm glad he's gone. His $3.5 mil salary frees up some more cash to entice other UFAs with [preferably a gritty LW, and another centre]. Bottomline, he's gone, and that's reason enough to celebrate.  (2) Hasek deal becoming final. Sportsnet is reporting that Hasek has agreed to terms with the Sens for a $2-$3.5 mil base contract, with heavy performance-based incentives. Should the Sens win the Cup, he will be the highest paid goaltender in the league. I've discussed this before, and I stick by that Hasek is our best option. His age and fondness for injury makes me nervous, but Lalime gives me nervous breakdowns. As a neutral observer, Hasek is still completely unpredictable. As a Sens fan, I have to throw all my support behind him [but not on his groin, because that thing is carrying most of our hopes].  (3) Sens draft picks. Was very surprised at Meszaros being available at no. 23, and Kirill Lyamin is a steal. Peter Regin is the highest rated Danish prospect, which I find hilarious.
