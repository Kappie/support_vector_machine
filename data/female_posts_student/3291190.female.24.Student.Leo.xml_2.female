It was beginning to pour,  they started singing "Our love is like water, been down  abused for being strange". I just remember kissing him,  feeling the rain trickling down my face. It was such an awesome feeling. Like we were the only two people in the world.  Its funny because I spoke to my sister tonight, I think she is going to leave her husband. Hes a real ass, but from what I can gather, they have had some good times. So I begin to think, what if, forever isn't the whole point....what if its just holding on to bits  pieces of moments. That are pure but brief. Isn't that just as good? Why clutter up our lives with insincere talks  promises of a lifetime spent together, when you truly aren't with them right now?
