It'll be good to have you back, now that we're all veteran DIs now (much show of muscleage on this one)...heheh.  WELLLLLL very groovy, cannot wait to see ye back in the Pit, this acidic, stinking, rotten cesspool of dismemberment and decay, this festering maggot heap that drags my entrails from my lifeless body and sucks my brains through my earlobes, big ol' AKA to all of this, school.  See ya then.
