Woke up late and rushed to school in my dad's car... Although not late for both duties and school... the whole day is still a veri boring day. Nothing went really good and that things tomorrow will still carry on as a big big mystery and i only can say that forever in school... Forever theres' tests... :D Hope that tml will be a better day for all the people in this world....
