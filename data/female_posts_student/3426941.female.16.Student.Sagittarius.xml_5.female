No I do not dress like Britney Spears in her "Baby One More Time" music video. My uniform actually sucks. Anyway, yeah. I like theater and have been in some shows both at my school and a local boys high school.  I set up this blog so my closest friends(who know who they are,) can read about my day, and basically read my random ramblings,as the title clearly states.   I should be studying for exams, but I am so NOT doing that right not. Oh well, like getting good grades actually matters?  Yesterday I went to a party for my friend Billy after being invited by Ryan after going to DeSmets DDP picnic. That was some fun stuff. Yeah, especially when we talked about turtle erections.... er I mean... Nevermind. But if you ever see a turtle flipped over on the road, you have my permission to giggle suspiciously.  Well, I'll post more later. Ryan if you are reading this, thanks for the idea.
