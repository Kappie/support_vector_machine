After having our weekly (more or less) breakfast-lunch at Reme's, we booked it downtown to the Upper West Side to catch 13 Going on 30, the new Jennifer Garner chick flick. Seeing as how the three of us are accustomed to watching Ms. Garner being all action in Alias, we were pumped to see her take on a more light-hearted, comedic role. After stocking up on snacks at Duane Reade (to sneak into the movie theater, of course), we headed to Loew's.   The movie rocked. Jennifer Garner is a great actress. The chick who played Tom Tom was good, too. But, to sum up (without giving away the plot and the ending), the movie had an awesome cast, cute plot (quite similar to Big), and an amusing ending. And, well, the movie made me a bit nostalgic for the '80s. The soundtrack contributed to that though. Fantastic music selection. Thriller, Jessie's Girl. Dude. I actually ended up buying the soundtrack off of the Barnes and Nobles website as soon as I got back to the Heights.   But, people, go see the movie if you haven't seen it. If I can skip out on studying (what happened to the gunner deep down inside of me?!) and pay $10.25 to see it, it has to be good, right? Right. Go. Now.
