My dad dragged the whole family to a baseball game last night with the promise of fireworks. He made us get there TWO HOURS early so we could walk around and see the new stadium and the game started at 7... and ended at 1:15 AM. 16 mother fucking innings. Six hours and fifteen minutes. Plus we were there two hours early. Plus the fireworks were like 40 minutes. I was at that goddamn ballpark for nine fucking hours AND THEY LOST. GAH! And the guys sitting behind us were the dumbest people on the planet. No joke. And they were loud too, so I caught this little snippet of their conversation... "What was the name of the beach they stormed on D-Day" "Normandy" "No, that was the name of the country. What was the name of the  beach " "oh, I don't know man."  OH MY GOD  There are so many things wrong with that, 1. why the fuck are you talking about world war 2?  2. why are you so stupid? etc.  anyway at least the fireworks were good, despite the fact they played every possible song that even mentions "America" or "U.S.A."  that's nine hours spent with my family watching the most boring sport in the universe (including curling and the games we play in gym) that I will never get back.  I'm so bitter
