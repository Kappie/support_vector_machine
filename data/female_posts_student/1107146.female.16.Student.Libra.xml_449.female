But now you're back and it's definitely you, with one of the better Rosie slams I've ever heard, I about had an aneurysm when I read the "make concessions" part and I still laugh out loud when I do read it...which unfortunately for me, since the cool "I can see the posts and make one" format of the BLog is up, I'm reading it every minute and drawing ever closer to said aneurysm.  There's a whole situation, really? Boy howdy, I'm feeling left out.  And Linds understands exactly what I meant when I said  97 Oligarchy Pie Amongst The Burning Corpsed Doo-Wah?  I swear, she's the only one left among all of us. And not a sarcastic cowgirl in the least. Heheh.  Guys!...  I'm pregnant!  Some background...I  hate  Papa John's pizza, I think it's really gross. And I  hate  Grape Faygo, I don't like grape carbonateds most of the time. So...guess what I had for din-din tonite? Some of you may need rocket science degrees before figuring this one out.  I'M PREGNANT! At least I hope so, for crying out loud. We went to get a movie (and I really need to give a note on that in a second), and there's a Papa John's right next door, and it smelled really fraggin' goot for some reason, and I turned to my dad and said, "Let's get some frickin' Papa John's" He hates it to, but he goes, "Ok," So we did.  And also...Gardetto's snack mix kicks major ass. And whilst walking around Sam's today with father looking for the most random shit in the world (baby wipes and ant traps...put down the hashpipe, dad!) I came across the LARGEST BAG OF GARDETTO'S IN EXISTENCE. So we bought it, and here I am happily indulging every rye chip I can find, and, of course, being a little candy ass and downing another great can of Grape Faygo.  I hate my life, it was a boring day.   But I wrote a bunch of new songs!  Gutter Ballad ,  Tainted ,  Asphyxiate ,  Into The Outside , and finishing work on Abby's song, which she has so tenatively titled,  Abby Song ...well it had a  The , but I cut it off for intrigue's sake...I hope she likes it, the song. It sounds nice...it's one of those like Jerry's that are really nice and I could sit around and play for a few hours and like it better each time I hear it. And that's weird from me, cuz I hate most of my own stuff after a while. Cry. And...I'm no poet so the words probably are really really sappy and I'll just sit here going, "Well isn't that nice, heheh."   Augh.  I'm so tired it's not funny. Here's lookin' at you, kids.
