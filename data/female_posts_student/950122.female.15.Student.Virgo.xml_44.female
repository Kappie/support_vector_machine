I found out earlier today that she had Typhoid Fever, which really freaked me out. She's better now. n_n Gela LIVES! :) Our Chemistry test was very easy... our English test ended up being hard. > It pissed me off; I studied all night for Chem instead of English. I should get over it pretty soon tho... Next week we'll have new lessons; more things to study. :P
