It started out w/ Austin...and all I want him to do is call me so that we can talk, but nooo that is too difficult to do, and someone MIGHT get the wrong idea by that. We "weren't" anymore b/c of our mothers, but now they BOTH say its fine...and he STILL hasn't called me, or talked to me....and i'm NOT going to call him, b/c then I sound desperate...plus that's not my style. I guess I just need someone (perferably a wonderful guy) to be friends with, and someone that will actually talk to me, and not make assumptions! Other than that...life has been boring. My bro has been at school practicing for a musical so far every day, all day...so i'm stuck at home w/ my mom and sister. I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but ya kinda get sick of it after a while! I can't really just call up my friends to go do something, b/c we all live so far apart, that it really doesn't work. And when my bro IS home, we usually try to hang out...go somewhere, but noooo of course not, b/c we have to spend time w/ the " FAMILY." Blah!!! So, i'm really not having a good summer so far, and i'm praying that it only gets better and no worse, b/c that would be soo horrible! Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now...
