Actually, im not a huge fan of coffee, and i'm most certainly not really a morning person, i need to get up atleast an hour or two early, before i actually do something, so i can sit and relax, and adjust slowly, sleeping in and hopping out of bed is my worst nightmare. >. Hehe, thats cute. i was going to wake up this morning and go for a run, but it's looking pretty gloomy out, so perhaps i'll stay home and just do pilates or something. Last night before i went to sleep i lifted some light hand weights and did lots of crunches, and an excercise thats good for the legs, i dont know what its called, it was good, slept good. i have the day off today, i have a huge urge to go spend money...can't. Must resist. i'm stressed out, i think today i should make some time to meditate. Or take a nap, both sound good, maybe both. :P i feel like i'm stuck in the middle of a huge mess, like im a little plush toy, and people are tearing me apart, for my attention. For me. What happens when someone wants to change you, instead of praising the good things Your do, instead they focus upon what You should do better, Your flaws, what You lack. What happens when someonefocuses so much on what they want, and what You don't have, that everything You look in the mirror, the reflection stares back at you. Mocking. Seems so be saying that your not perfect, and you aren't good enough. i hate mirrors, i avoid them when possible. Everyone tries to tell me what to do with my life. Where i should go. Everyday is a struggle. Things feel unrealistic, wrong in a lot of senses. So many hours i spend just thinking, wondering, am i really being true to myself, is this what i really want? Maybe everything is a lie, and i'm even fooling myself. Foolish me...
