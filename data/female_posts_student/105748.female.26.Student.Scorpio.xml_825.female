He'd give the movie geek of Beat the Geeks a run for his money!  By the way, MOM --  Never Say Never Again  has already been used.  Only 12 more hours until we get to see LOTR The Two Towers tomorrow.  We're sitting off to the side this time, 10A (still front row, though).  Usually we get 6A or 7A (center front), but we were too late this time.  Brian bought the tickets yesterday (two days in advance) but it was still too late to get our usual seats.  It seems we've under-estimated the movie's popularity!
