And I suppose, her own artistic expression.   In this respect, the audience also had every right to react they way they did.  They booed, stormed out of the theater and tore down posters.   Ok. So maybe the audience took it a step to far. What does ripping down posters really accomplish? A big fat nothing, I'll tell ya. In fact, the new owners of the Alladin Theater, have already made arrangements to have Ronstadt back at the venue this fall - - with Moore on backup vocals.  Moore on backup vocals? (Wraps rope around neck, and kicks chair out from under.) I'd rather die then hear that.  I know that politics have become the "in" thing. It's actually quite trendy. EVERYBODY is taking a side and then doing their best to "make a difference." Actors. Musicians. Even politicians. But you know what, there is a time and a place for people in the entertainment industry to express their view points. And when they are performing, in front of hundreds of thousands, this is NOT the time for it. I can honestly tell you that the majority of people there, don't give a crap. Now, I wouldn't have walked out of Linda Ronstadt's show, but at the same time, I don't want to hear about her love and devotion for Michael Moore.   However, please keep in mind, there is an exception to every rule.  If the music you are listening to is political in nature, well then, obviously if you are attending a concert you would expect the show to be political in nature. That's okay. In fact, that's great. Hell, go to  urlLink punkvoter  and purge yourself with political music.   Enjoy!
