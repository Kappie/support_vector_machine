I was not pleased about being in my pj's but still it's great to hang out with them. We all just talked in the living room and then I took them for a ride in my car. David said I could come and hang out in Latrobe anytime. They're both really great guys and I'm sure they'd agree! LOL.      I'm catering for some retreat groups at the camp this weekend. I'm not in charge of cooking yet, just set up and clean up. My parents are hoping that I'll eventually take over the job of cooking for retreats though. If the thing with the bank works out I don't know how I could possibly do the catering. Speaking of which, I didn't get to go put in an application thanks to Ellen. She was the one who was supposed to watch the boys today. Instead, I was stuck here without a car because my mom decided to use MY car to take Ellen to her friend's house. It's offensive, really. No consideration for what I had planned to do.      I have come to the conclusion that the reason these blog things are so popular is because people can just sit at their computers all day talk all about themselves or complain. I think I'm going to force myself to say 1) Something good about someone who isn't me, 2) Something good that has happened that day, or 3) Something that makes someone else smile. I just hate sounding so self-centered, but I guess it can be expected when you're writing something about your own life.    I'm sick of over analyzing every situation.      I think Ellen may have stolen some money from me.
