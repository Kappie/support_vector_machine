All you want to do is get from point A to point B and there are all of these construction crews forces you to take detours. Well that is my life right now. It seems that all I want to do is get a few things done like cleaning my room, washing my car, reading a book, hanging out with friends, and going to work. But there is never enough time in a day and then my room never gets clean, my car is just gross (although the other day thanks to Ambers help I did get it cleaned out), I am in the middle of about 7 books that have no chance of getting finished, and I have so many friends that I can't find time for them all. I do go to work but that isn't really a want in life it's a "have too."Don't get me wrong I love my life and I do have time to do a lot of things. But it's just these small things that I want to do and I just can't find the time. UGHHHH!!!  Anyway, Last night I had a great time. I went out with a friend and we went to Barnes, then to dinner, and then to another friends house, then we watched Batman until about 4:30 in the morning. Great night!!! Unfortunately I didn't wake up till about 1:30 this afternoon. OOOOPS!!! But I never get to sleep in so it was really nice to do that too. But then again I woke up thinking of all the things I wanted to get done today and now don't have the chance because I stayed up way too late. Oh well there is always tomorrow.
