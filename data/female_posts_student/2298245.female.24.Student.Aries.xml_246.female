So I am just going to keep typing until whatever it is that needs to get out gets out.  Then I will collapse into slumber.    I know I should be happy, upbeat, ready to go, but there are so many thoughts churning around in my head right now.  There are too many changes coming up, and while some of them are good and wonderful, and for the best, I feel that I don't want them to happen.  This is because I am selfish, and I am feeling fairly content about the state of certain things in my life, and I don't want them to get all stirred up and altered again so soon after finally being satisfied with them.  I know change is a natural part of life, and a huge part of me welcomes it, but there are some things that I wish could stay the same forever.  But they can't of course, and those are always the changes that come first.  Why do I have to be so complicated?  Why can't I be one of those people who do not dwell on thoughts like these?   Time goes by too quickly, and once it slips by it is gone forever.  There are so many opportunities that I have let slip away with the passing of time, and now I wish I could have all of them back.  Well, maybe not all of them, because that would be a little scary and tough to deal with all at once, but I do wish some of them would re-present themselves.  I want to be one of those people who doesn't look back, who merely looks forward, but unwieldy forces are always pulling me in the other direction.   I've even fallen out of my routines over the past couple of days.  Part of this has been because of my sheer busy-ness.  But also, I think that now that I have nothing to do - or at least I keep thinking I have nothing to do, so it's nice to know that I have no trouble deluding myself in some respects - I find that I am alone with nothing to do, which is the way it always is in the end.  I sometimes rather prefer being busy, for there isn't time to dwell on the internal, on the emptiness, for I am too busy focused on what needs to get done.  I do not know why this does not help to keep me buried in my work, or stop me from procrastinating, but it does not.  I must not be posting about the right things, because I am not really feeling any better.  When I should be feeling great.  Tonight was a good night.  Dinner with two of the best and most supportive people that I have the deepest pleasure of knowing.  Yet it was in leaving them that this uneasiness set itself upon me.  Perhaps it is just the loneliness again, and the desire for things never to change, or even for things to change back to the way they were.   But then, I think back, and I've always been like this.  This is the problem that I have always had.  Looking back, I always remember that I was content when I know somewhere deep inside that I was not.  So this gives me some comfort, that I have gotten through it before, that this has always been the way it has been, that this is just the result of being prone to introspection and self-doubt.  And I know, in that same deep down place, that everything will be OK.  Because it has too.    Even if one doesn't always get everything one wants.  There are any number of things that I want right now.  And I will probably get none of them.  And somehow, that is OK with me.  Because I've not gotten what I wanted in the past, and I've lived to tell the tale, and that's all one can ask for in the end.
