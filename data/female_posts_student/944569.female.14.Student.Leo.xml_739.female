I'm guessing there was a spider in the room and it crawled on my elbow while i was sleeping.  I must have moved in my sleep which explains why it bit me.  I could see white bite marks in the middle of the bump.  After it bit me, i'm guessing it had a tiny bit of harmless venom in it or it was really dirty, the area around the bite began to swell and redden.  That would explain the burning sensation of the bite spreading.  Damn that spider.  Spider bites really hurt!
