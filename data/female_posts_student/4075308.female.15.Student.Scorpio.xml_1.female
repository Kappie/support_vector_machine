Bring it back the day after and write a review. This isn’t really a review; More an account.  I’m writing about this one though, because although fictional, there is a great sense of triumph at the end of the book. Written by Mark Haddon and winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award (JUNE 2003), this book tells the story of fifteen year old Christopher Boone, and his struggle to find out the truth about Wellington, and his mother.  Christopher suffers from Asperser’s syndrome. He loved lists, patterns, numbers and the truth. He hated things that are brown or yellow, crowds, changes, and being touched. He believed his mother died of a heart attack, which is what he was told by his father.  He lived a happy, settled life, until he discovered his neighbour’s dog, Wellington, dead. He began a search to find the murderer of the dog, and began to write a book about it. In his book, he includes mathematical facts, and his view of other people’s minds, and the way the brain works.  This book stands out for me, because there are so many times when you feel truly sorry for him, and he’s the kind of person you’d want to meet… if he were real. His disability causes him to think like an infant; innocent and immature. Yet he is able to cope in most situations, so long as certain rules are applied. His food must not be mixed. People must not touch him. Even his own parents aren’t allowed to hug him.  I think our lives are like that sometimes. We don’t want everything to be complicated, and get annoyed when people are clingy. And yet some of us are bored so easily.  For me, Haddon’s book is a story of a child’s personality, and the way it works in his favour, to achieve the goals he sets for himself.  Thank you Mr. Haddon. Looking forward to the next.
