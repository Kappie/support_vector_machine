Josh got hit by a car monday.. literally..aww poor him! - nothing too great has happened -ive gone through alot of drama though.. and i mean ALOT...well i offically have two friends at UMS ( my school ). ok heres the drama try to keep up... Ashton ( bffae? or so i thought) was talking about me last wens. when i wasnt at school ( i decided to skip ) well i found out Thursday that she was talking about me the previous day ( wens. ) i was going to approach her but she wasnt at school thurs or friday- my theory is that she ran scared - well monday rolls around and she didnt speak ONE WORD to me ( i thought she was my best friend?) so iwas like whatever screw her - but she CONTINUED to talk about me - so i missed tues and i came to school part of today for like two classes ( American History and Art ) well i get to school to see Samantha my old best friend laughing with ashton my now old best friend - but the ironic thing is that Ashton talked about samantha ALL year long! i just dont get it , ashton also talked about megan lauren kate and celine all year long and now that she doesnt have me she is friends with them ( its fourth quarter now ) i dont understand ( i dont blame you if you dont either ) i suppose they will all turn against me ( whopee) i decided to leave after Art ( 11:45) because i couldnt handle all this with their bull shat and me being deathly ill ( sarcasim ). i dont want to go back tomorrow - i still have corinne and clay - theyve never left me or talked about me or hated me or lied to me  and ive been friends with corinne since 6th grade and clay since 7th - i owe alot to them  - its not everyday you;ll find friends like them - id rather have two great friends than a bunch of fake friends i leave for college in August of 2005 a bout a year and 5 months away - and after that i wont care about the petty worries of high school i wont talk to tose friends ever again - except for Corinne and Clay - its grim reality- if your still reading and some what following me ( congrats ) then i guess i seem like im handling it ok - but im not - im honestly hurt - i may only have a year and 5 months left but id like to have friends during that year and 5 months - when you get backstabbed and betrayed it hurts - and i think it hurts the backstabber and betrayer too - thanks for listening/reading  lots o love    Lindsay
