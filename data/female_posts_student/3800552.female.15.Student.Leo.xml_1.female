Today, my family was eating these sub things and ym mom got me a "fuhlafful" or whatever, because I'm a vegetarian. It was really gross. Then, I saw one of the Cuban Sub thingies, and it looked so gross, I threw up. It had like so much meat on it. . .  Ugh. .  Poor animal :'(     Does anyone have a suggestion as to which book I should read? I really feel like reading right now. (Usually when I'm depressed, I feel the need to read or accomplish something, that's why I am trying to do anything I possibly can!). Well, I didn't cut today! *high five* but i did cry. . . a lot. . . I don't know. I really shouldn;t be talking about this becaue it WILL make me angry again. I feel like getting high. Like, LSD high. Ugh. . . I am such a loser. YAHOO! My mom bought some booze!  Like, a LOT of alcoholic beverages. It's crazy. Okay, well I am gonna go.  Buh- Bye!     **Kat    current mood:  hungry current music: BRIGHT EYES!!!
