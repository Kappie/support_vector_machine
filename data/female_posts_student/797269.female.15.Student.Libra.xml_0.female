There are so many opinions I have about it but they’re not worth listing off if you haven’t seen the movie, which, at least for me, opened up a million new thought paths. SO what you have to do is go see it AND THEN call me! I want to discuss with as many people as possible.   We signed up for the unlimited rentals thing at blockbuster. So exciting! Today will be Lost in Translation, if I get the time.   Must get ready for New York tomorrow, Cheerios audition with maybe a little shopping on the side 
