I havent really written a real post in a while. i tried to on my birthday, but dylan was distracting and took over my post. psh.  my birthday sort of sucked, i guess. My dad made me clean for a lot of it. all of his shit, too...but my aunt came so thats cool.  SHES TAKING ME TO LONDON AND I AM SO EXCITED!!!! :D  whee!  but yeah, dylan took me out for my birthday to dinner, and then spent the night at my house, and my dad walked in on us AGAIN! (jesus) he never comes to check on us unless were doing something. Karma?  i got new cds, (dramarama and leftover crack) and a ginormous cd case, and a dress, and a lovesac. And now my aunts here, so ill prolly go shopping.  ack! I have to go, i think were going somewhere. Ill write later, sorry i suck at this post-writing business.  !abbyÂ¡
