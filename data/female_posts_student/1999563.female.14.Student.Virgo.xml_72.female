I had to lead hollywood (Holly Would...hahah...thats the coolest brand- the clothes are SO cute! Any who....)  squares...it was INTERESTING. I kept pronouncing words wrong. Lol. Then we had the freshman "reward" Yuck. They shaved a water balloon with whipped cream all over it on our head. It was quite interesting. I was SO stinking wet! Then I had to go to a spanish "workshop"  She gave us all 3 points extra credit for just BEING there! Mwa haha. It was grand. Then on Tuesday Megan, SHOOOT! I forgot her name. I am a dork. :) Lol. I love you.  Well any who...we are singing a song about chickens and we get another 3 points! Yippe!  After school I went to row. It was alright! We just washed the boats and such. Quite intertaining.   Then we RUSHED home. I hopped in the shower and tried to get all the whipped cream out of my luverly hair. I succeded! Then I ran down stairs and grabbed some chinese food. I blow-dryed my hair while eating my dinner.  It was quite intereesting. Because I blow dry my hair upside down (if that makes any sense at all... :D )  So I kept chocking on egg roll. Its hard to eat up side down.  Then Sara came and we picked up Lori Ann then headed the the dance. The dance was really fun acctually. Better than expected. Only one freshman guy showed up. I was happy because i couldn't be myself with those guys there... :/     THEN! we went home at 10:30 and "my feet hurt so stinkin' bad"  (TRICIA!) So I went to bed at about 11.    At 5 i had to wake up because we had a rowing reggetta! It was pretty fun. My boat got 5 place. The boys varsity got 2, girls vasity got 3, and I think the boys varsity got like last. Hahah.   So....thats pretty much it.  Oh yeah. I am runnign away. Hahhahaha...My mom said I was fat last night and she just keeps insulting me. It makes me so mad. I just run into the forest, sit on a log, and cry. I love crying. It always seems to make me happy.  I think I am going to save money to buy a plane ticket to MANDY'S HOUSE! That would so stinkin' rock.   I better go.  Much love,  Lauraaaa   P.S. I am so not fat.
