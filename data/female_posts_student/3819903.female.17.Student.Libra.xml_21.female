Yesterday:  Woke up and rapidly hopped in the car (to escape from having to clean), to head to the Grandma's to get some rays and Swim. After I got a call from Vicki saying that there was a doubleheader baseball game of North vs. West that started at 4, I rushed home to take a shower, to not smell so chlorified, andended up getting to West right on time! It was perfect timing on my part! thank you, thank you!   Watched the Northstar Boys lose their first game 9-4, and needless to say I had little hope for the second game. The second game was 4000 times better than the previous. Better pitching (AJ Garcia pitched 6 and 1/2 innings), better contact, and better defense! It was like a whole other team! West had like 3 different pitchers! It was ridic! But Caleb had an awesome hit in the 5th inning! I'll take you back...Bases loaded, no outs, and they bring in a new pitcher, one that throws extreme side arm and bends over when he throws...it was a hoot! The first pitch this new guy throws, Cal hits it to the fence...about 6 ft short of a home run! So he had a 3 run, double! It definitely got the crowd up and awake, as we took a comfortable lead of 9-3. We ended up winning 13-7, it was a great game!   So after 5 hours of sitting on my deriere, i got up to join the friends at AMF for $1 bowl! So I thought it was gonna be like...10 people max, ummm...NO! there were soo many people bowling, not bowling, people that just came to say hi! I mean there were at least 45 people there at 1 time! it was Crazy! Some people that came that I didnt think would be there...Kevin Gamms, and Ryan Andrews. Nicole Invited them! Then we proceed to play 2 games, and it got late and many people went home, but Kevin invited Nicole and I to his house to go "hot tubbing" with him and ryan. I was game! Nicole was soo funny, she was like, I being asked to sit with a hot man half naked...what do i do? I laughed soo hard, i think she thought i was being mean! GO!!   So we went to Kevins, I already had the swim suit in the car, from Ginny's so we stopped at Nic's and she got hers...then proceeded to the Golfers house. We get there and hop in the tub...HOT!!! Holy Moley! it was soo hot, and it was humid out, so it made it so easy to get light headed! After about 5 minutes in the luxurious hot tub, we hopped out to go run in the yard and get cooler. We sat down and chilled in the grass for a while as we caught our breath! wow, it was soo warm! After a while inside, we went home around 1:30! Wo we had a fun time!   Today:  Woke up around 9...thats the first time in a while that I did that! and got ready to Zoo it up with Nicole and Amanda! Wow, I hadn't been to the Zoo in like 5 years! It was definitley a fun time! We took lots of pictures and got lots of sun...maybe too much! But at the end of our elementary field trip, our legs were like jello, and we were soo tired from walking about 6 miles, and sitting down once...on the train!! hell yeah! i felt like i was 6 again!   Now im off to the RWK concert to see Tony entertain us... then the plans will flow from there! Adios Amigos!
