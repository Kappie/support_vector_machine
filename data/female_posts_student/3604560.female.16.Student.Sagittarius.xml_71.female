I'm exaggerating the word so no one can correct me (its MEANT to have lots of o's)   Natbat, Kill Bill 2 is supposed to be less violent than vol 1; people say its waaaaaaaay less violent than Passion of the Christ but they gave it a higher rating anyway...:(  How's everyone's holidays going so far? 5 1/2 days down...11 1/2 days to go. (FYI I'm counting the weekend of the last week of school so don't correct me about how many days we've got. If you do I'll post a post with just the word phallus and nothing else....hehehe "post a post" Oh I crack myself up sometimes (to put it in an American way)  Ooooh I just watched 11'9"01. In case you didn't know it's a combo of 11 short films by 11 different directors from 11 different countries, each bit lasting 11 min, 9 sec and 1 frame. I know its really pushing it but some of it was really sad and really well done. 2 outta the 11 were in English so subtitle's galour. Sean Penn was the American one. It was pretty cool. The Jap one I really saw no relevance to New York but other than that the rest were pretty arts-y.   Tina, when do ya wanna see King Arthur? And where? Lemme know will ya?  As always Namárië
