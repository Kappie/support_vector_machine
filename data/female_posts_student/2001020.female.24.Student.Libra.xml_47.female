Talking to my friend P online, feelin' a little sorry for myself after the grades rolled in, but hey, this is a new semester,and law school is not graded on a curve for the entire three years! So fuck it! I had a great time last night at bar night. I haven't gone out w/o M (the guy I'm dating) in awhile, and I hate to say it, but it was kinda nice. I got to go back to being myself, the social butterfly that I am. Not in terms of dudes and hooking up and shit, but just being me. M isn't nearly as social as I am. I have come to realize that not everyone I go to school with sucks. I have to deal with them for the next three years (well, only two and a half more!), so I'd better just like it, damnit! I was supposed to go to Boston this weekend but the damn car isn't complying. I guess I will get it jumpstarted soon...I have no option in that respect. Stupid Syracuse winters! Anyways, I'm going to try to get into my website (which I can't anymore and I really don't wanna start a brand new one), and chat w/Peejer. I will write more whenever the feelin' hits me!
