Now, keep in mind, this is a class full of 9th graders, and we are known to have a habit of reacting to the most perverse meaning of a phrase, and also to be victims of contageous(sp?) giggling- i.e. if everyone's laughing about something and we only think it's a little bit funny, its really hard for us to not laugh. At least thats how a lot of us are. Anyway, in our unit on simple machines, our teacher- let's just call him Mr. Arbuckle (!!garfield!! lol) in order to protect his identity- was giving us notes on levers, pulleys, wedges, inclined planes, and screws. Well, we get to the notes on screws and he starts talking about a company he once worked for who put together dashboards for hummers for military use, and they kept falling apart. He goes on and on about it- i was only 1/2 paying attention- and says something about how the screw that held the speedometer in place was held in place by a nut. Now a few of the more immature of us (not including me) started giggling a bit at the fact that he had said "screw" and "nut" in the same scentence. Now i have to interrupt myself to tell you that these 3 guys in the class have a habit of saying "lubrication!" and "power lube!" randomly in the middle of class in a mock deep voice that immitates one of the geography teachers. Well, Mr. Arbuckle says "Now, the people who were manufacturing the screws and the nuts were putting this lubrication on the nuts and screws..." and at this point virtually everyone in the class- including me- starts giggling, because he said screw, nuts, and lubrication all in the same scentence. He gives us a wierd look but keeps on talking, and all of a sudden a look of "i suddenly realized what they're laughing about and its really perverse!" crosses his face and he goes "Aw, JESUS!" and everyone starts cracking up, it was great. He tries to gain control over the class and goes ", LISTEN! LISTEN! Lubrication is used for things other than sex!" It made my day, it was sooo funny.
