The mall? I don't know what she wears. Banana Republic, I know that much because I have a shirt just like her's except in a different color. I wonder if Jess is going tonight. She went to Anna's bday party years ago, before we were good friends. Oh, the eighth grade memories. I know it's typical of me, and it's terrible, but I wonder who's going and if I'll get along with them. So here's an icky question: should I leave early? There's a CWOTO tonight too. If I go tonight (and it's at 7:30) I'll be able to take math IIC tomorrow, but then I won't see Andrew or the rest of the people in the TO area. I don't think we got IIC packets last week. I still have 2 left over from when I was lazy. I should take a test out of a book with a scale. I want to get Clif's bio AP book.   I remember econ in Aca Deca freshman year: wants are unlimited...and then I forget the rest of it. Something about how supply is limited. Oh, econ.
