I'm not sure if I got anything accomplished or if I'm still in the same place before I made the phone call. Not sure if they were the wrong or right things to say, not sure if I got an apologetic or an "oh I pity you" response...I don't know. All I know is that it wasn't wrong to call, because I feel alright and I'm not crying. I guess my body is in shock. I guess I don't want to let myself have a reaction to this, because whether or not I admit it to myself, it still hurts. And what he did can't be taken back and won't go away with time. The effects may go away, or fade, or get buried...but what happened can't be taken back. Which means that we can't go backwards and go back to being "friends" (if that's what you can call what we used to be) because...well, because he fucked it up, and when you fuck things up, you can't get them back again. So. So, that's that. He's going to visit V in New York tomorrow. He told me that she and he are not together, but I don't believe it. That's it. I give him no credibility anymore, whatsoever. I don't feel like I can believe anything he says. I discredit everything he has said in the past, and everything he has yet to say. But I just want to scream at the complexity of this situation! I don't know why it has to be this way! It's so ridiculous but he really left no other option. Ah. Brain on overload...or maybe brain frozen. Either way, must go to sleep before numbness wears off...don't want to be conscious for that. Good night.
