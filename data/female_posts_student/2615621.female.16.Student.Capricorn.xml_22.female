I think the lyrics are beyond well written and i'm sure everyone has felt this way at one time or another even if it's about your best friend. Life goes by all too fast to get too busy to say that thought or words or to dance on the kitchen floor, we all have someone who makes everything all right. "Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings"  When I Look To The Sky-----Train   When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye   And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go   Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me And you make everything alright  And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me And I can always find my way when you are here   And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away   Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me  When I am hoping it won't pass me by   And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me
