Him: "I think you know my point." (leaves)  So....is this suppose to be a guilt trip? I  can  earn things. I've earned the top grades in my class and numerous acheivement awards. And honor roll, too! And I'm working my way towards a job...still. But it's hard, when you have AP classes and extracurricular obligations.  Furthermore, mine was a  gift ---a  birthday  present to be exact. I didn't ask for it, it was unplanned, it was a  suprise . Besides, Pej's grandparents from his dad side could SO buy him a laptop---they're pretty well off, so I've heard. My friend once asked if I would have been better off with money for college as a gift......a great idea.......then I could spend it on "textbooks."
