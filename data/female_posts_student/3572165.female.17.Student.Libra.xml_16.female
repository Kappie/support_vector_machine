I am a graduate! no longer in high school, the doors of college are wide open before me! lol, it's a little scary...everything was just starting to get very familiar and comfortable at Trinity - i'm definately going to miss it! But college is looking very exciting right now, especially with all the Trinity ppl going! High school all over again, no? lol, no, i don't think so. But before this fall, there are many other things to look forwards to! I would appreciate very much prayer for my trip to Scotland with my MET group - for safe travel, that God would be preparing our hearts, and that He would use us to encourage the church in Airdrie.  VIRGINIA BEACH !!! Thank you, everyone, who made the trip such a great time - including "Vince", yes, that was definately a funny memory :-P ( i can't believe we even  named  him!) Well, it's very late, and i have promised someone to be up with the sun...lol
