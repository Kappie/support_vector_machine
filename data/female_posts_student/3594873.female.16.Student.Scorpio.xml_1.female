The sky is blue, a clear blue that speaks of children playing in the park and family picnics. The flowers wake up from their long hibernation and gently unfold, facing the powerful sun’s rays. Birds chirp and sing to each other of romance. A caterpillar fights desperately pushing its cocoon, its wrapped blanket, and emerges as a splendid butterfly gliding the waves of air ever so lightly. Bees hover over their hives, busy work stations, producing sweet, golden honey.   Winter is gone, shed like a snake’s skin for spring. Its spotless coat put away in the closet.   Amina:  And then, I wake up from the terrible nightmare I was having, and find to my joy that all is well with the world. There is still the pungent smell of smoke, a layer of smog covering the sky, and dead birds falling from the sky. Yes, Chicken Liken was wrong: the sky was not falling: it was just the beautiful world on one of its regular routine days… (sniffs the nice smell of pollution and feels once again refreshed.)   Mariam:  My poor darling aMinA. Chicken Licken was incorrect in her assumption as are you. It is neither the sky falling nor the smoke which has created such drastic changes in our country so rapidly, and with no warning. No, you’re both wrong.   Amina:  You know my insignificant one, that chicken licken has an usual name. I doubt anyone would want to be eaten, and yet she calls herself “licken.” However, that is not as strange as the name “winnie the pooh.” Please explain to me the significance of having the word pooh inside the name… Aaah, I have realized I didn’t ask you the reason you are so convinced of my wrongness.    Mariam:  Why you are wrong:  It is simply because Winnie the Pooh ate up all the honey and then had to go do doo doo. So a stinky smell engulfed the world. And people could no longer breathe. If the earth, itself, not alive could not take it and suffered from a hole within its atmosphere, it is no surprise that we humans are unable to.    Amina:  you do realize why there is a hole in the atmosphere. It is because the politicians know that everyone hates them and so they have planned an escape route in case, at some point, a fanatic tries to kill them. So the truth of the matter is the hole is just a way for the government, once again to trick us all and escape with all our mulla. Our doe. Our money. Show me the money. What are you talking about honey for?    Mariam:  You know, I heard that theory but rejected it. The truth is: there is no hole. I don’t see a hole in the sky. Do you see a hole in the sky?! No. Name me one person who has actually seen it? For all we know, people can be getting cancer because of the food or some governmental created project with us humans as the rodents- testers. You know, I realized that I did not comment on chicken licken. An unusal name, to be sure. Yet, hardly surprising. Her mom was a chicken rib, and her father was an absolute chicken drum.     Amina:  I have neither seen a hole in the sky nor the whole of the sky to know whether there is a hole in the sky. However, I have been assured that there is indeed a hole in the sky.  ________________________________________________________________________  and so you can see why we wished to show you the important matters we discuss. Seriously though, what’s up with name Winnie the Pooh. I mean instead of the characters calling him Winnie, they go like “Pooh….Pooh bear.” What kind of a sick joke is it to name a beloved character to kids after the number 2 we do in the bathroom? And then, I can’t believe it when I hear one of the characters going like “Pooh, where are you?” I’ll tell you where pooh is. Pooh is in the bathroom where it is supposed to be. Honestly, I can not for the life of me, figure out what was wrong with the directors of that cartoon.  _____________________________________________________________________________   Amina Banawan Amina Banawan, amina Banawan,  Amina Banawan, Banawan Amina  Mariam Banawan Mariam Banawan, mariam Banawan,  Maraiam Banawan, Banawan Mariam  If this website does not appear when I write “Amina or Mariam Banawan” in the google search, I am going to explode. I mean every time I search myself, I never come up with amazing moi: people don’t know that I am alive.  It’s like google doesn’t recognize my name….or just doesn’t want to.   I have decided that I am going to copy our names like twenty times on this blog just to make sure the website does appear. I want people to know that I exist. I want a person to type in my name on the net, not really thinking about it, and then discover accidentally that we do indeed have a site. So…….  Amina and Mariam Banawan.  Mariam and Amina Banawan.  Ms. Mariam Banawan   Ms. Amina Banawan A Banawan M Banawan   Mariamina Banawan.  Amina  Mariam Banawan Mariam  Amina Banawan   Isn’t it ironical? Ashley and Mary Kate’s names also start with A  M. Once I told my friend that the reason why our parents picked out our names with these letters was because they wanted to match Ashley and Mary Kate. It was so funny because she actually believed me…well, why not? I am a convincing actress…right    Back to the task at hand: Amina and Mariam Banawan. Mariam and Amina Banawan. Amina and Mariam Banawan have a website, and if google wants to not include them, well then, that’s google’s problem. Mariam and Amina will go check out yahoo’s search engine.  And that is to be taken as a threat, google. We are deadly serious about this. We’ll see if yahoo can find us or not.   Well it’s time to go…. But remember:   WE will Be back!!  ........................  And we are back!! Yesterday, on my first real day of summer, my parents plunged us back to the dark ages. Quietly, they disconnected the television from the satellite to broaden our interests!! To use our summer wisely?! Thankfully, all has been restored in our house after a little revolution- some people were taught lessons. JUST KIDDING!! I just woke up and found it back on. Only we’re only allowed an hour on it, but not to worry. Each one of us will choose a different hour and therefore gain an hour! The smarties that we are. =)  Talking about television: didja you guyz hear about Tarzan being banned? Didja hear about the reasons: They are so melodramatic. •	The fact that Tarzan had to help/ save Jane. The feminist movement said that this made girls believe that they are unable to protect themselves and need the help of males. They argued the movie had a brainwashing effect and promoted sexism in society.  •	Police all over the country said they are fed up of movies drawing their “evil” characters, ugly and big. They reason that criminals have no general appearance and children should be aware of this. After all, they think movies should teach children to expect the unexpected and know that even their teacher could be a criminal. •	Orphanages were outraged when a five year old ran away. When found and questioned on his reason, the boy said he wanted a home. He distinctly commented on the fact that Tarzan had been embraced by animals and had had a home with them. If living in the jungle was all he needed to do to get a home, well, he could certainly do that.  •	Foster homes were appalled at Kojak’s character- they fear children will be afraid to go to foster homes because they might feel that they will not be accepted by both parents.  •	Religious leaders are worried that the movie subtly promotes the message that the theory of evolution is correct and that humans did evolve from monkeys. •	The Environmental Organization found the appearance of the jaguar as a bad guy, would help encourage people to shoot these lovable creatures. They are concerned that children will grow up, believing that these animals are horrible predators and would thus do nothing to help protect them and save them from extinction. •	Physiatrists thought that the movie further increased peer pressure in children’s minds. “Young Tarzan had to prove to those other monkeys that he was worthy of their friendship. He succumbed to peer pressure and dived from a waterfall. We think this behavior teaches kids to do whatever they can to be accepted by a gang. We find it rather disturbing,” the physiatrists said.  •	The “LAS” (Love All Society) said it did not like how the characters in the play seemed to promote specieism. They said “It’s enough we have racism. Certain characters in that play promote specieism. They acted like humans and animals could not get along because of their differences. We would appreciate it if the characters were censored.” •	A Woman’s Right’s Movement Organization said they did not like how Jane took off most of her clothes at the end of the movie and only wore what appeared to be a bra, and a tiny version of a mini-skirt. They claimed that the way women are pictured in movies are horrible: but one would expect better from a children’s movie. Women did not have to look like models and dress this way: they had much more dignity than that. They think the movie’s underlying message is that nudity should be acceptable in our society.    If you guys did hear that the movie was banned, well then, you heard wrong. It wasn’t banned. We just made up all of those reasons.  (Losers, you actually believed us. Stop shaking your head. You did! I know you did!! Hehe)  ___________________________________________-
