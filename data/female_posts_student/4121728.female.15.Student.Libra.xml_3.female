Could you believe that our Math [Algebra 2 and Trigonometry] and Filipino tests were easier than our BALYUS [that's values but our teacher pronounces it that way.. lol.] What the hell!!! I scolded our teacher about it awhile ago and he just smiled! he just freakin'  smiled!  stupid teacher!          Relax.   Physics and Social Studies?  chicken.  haha! i didn't even study! the test was so easy and i'm so proud of my self!!!! haha.. tomorrow, all of this would end and i wouldn't have to worry any longer... maybe  not.              UP Tests are coming up.     and i didn't even study... or even take a glance/ peep in/ look in my UPCAT reviewer! darn! and my entrance test is at 6:30  am  on Saturday, August 7, 2004. shit! wish me more luck on this one coz this is my future!!!!
