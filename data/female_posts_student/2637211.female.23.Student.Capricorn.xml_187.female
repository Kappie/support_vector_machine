I know I need to be ready for it, and I'm really lucky to have Jerm support me through trying to find the right career and life path for myself. See, I feel really comfortable and confident about my personal life, and I feel like that's all in order, but I am completely lost when it comes to my professional life. I'm thinking that after I graduate, I'm going to focus on taking tests, like the LSAT, the CBEST, the GRE, and the civil service exam; I'm going to take language classes (Spanish, and maybe Dutch? I dunno) to broaden my skills and make me a more desirable job candidate in the fields I'm interested; and I'm going to get a part-time or even volunteering position at a local library, look for some kind of internship, and just get myself moving forwards towards a goal, so that I can accomplish it. It feels better to know that I have some kind of plan besides being depressed about crappy job prospects.
