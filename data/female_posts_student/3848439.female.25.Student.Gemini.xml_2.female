So I agreed to go with them to a drum circle at a bar called  urlLink Rhythm  on the near south side of Chicago.  Big mistake.  NOTE: I  highly  recommend Rhythm to anyone looking for a neat experience.  This is *not* a slam on the bar.  Just a slam on my decision to go there on this particular night, because I didn't get to bed until 1 AM when I was already cranky from lack of sleep.  Which means I got about 5 hours of sleep before I had to get up for  urlLink CPE (Clinical Pastoral Education - a summer of hospital chaplaincy in my case)  in the morning.  Urrgh!  After getting about 5 hours of sleep the night before.  Double urrgh!  So, I basically went to this drum circle and and was one of the few people of African descent there participating in this African drumming.  Grrr! - White folks with trust funds co-opting my  general heritage so they can assuage their White liberal guilt. But I stay out and pissy until 1 AM.  I'm taking responsibility for my bad judgment.  Usually whenever I'm at one of these cultural events where I'm surrounded by folks who probably want to urge me to vote for Nader while people of all races sit and sing  "Kumbaya"  in our dashikis, the first sighting of a White Guy with Dreadlocks just sends me over the mental edge.   Too many White Folks!  Ahhhhh!   I promise you, I'm a big fan of racial unity and understanding and folks meeting and seeing eye-to-eye.  I'm all about the interracial love.  But damn it!  Can't this happen in arenas where we all are fully clothed, all my fellow females are properly bra-ed up, and no White guys are walking around declaring their beeswaxed love for Bob Marley?!?!  ================ But I also fully understand and admit that this problem is mine to own.  I'm an African-American and I don't have enough  go-to  African-American friends.  I never have.  And now since I'm doing CPE at a hospital with a tiny population of African-Americans plus I'm continuting to live on campus at a Lutheran seminary, my day to day interactions with folks of my complexion is at an all-time low.  Which means I basically need to get off my own ass and find a way to meet Black folks like me.  Trouble is, I have no blasted idea as to how to do that.  Maybe I can figure something out by the end of the summer.  Also, I need to cultivate some hobbies.  It's really important for me to get myself out of Hyde Park whenever I can.  If I don't, I'll just go stir crazy.  I think my problem is that I don't have any hobbies or interests that I pursue.  So then I get bored and campus and wait for other folks to suggest outings.  So I go out a lot - basically whenever folks invite me - but I don't really do a lot of stuff that I initiate.  I just follow other people as they pursue their hobbies and interests.  So, what hobbies can I get before the end of the summer that won't add to my stress level?  I don't know, but surely something will make itself apparent.  Or I might just have to suck it up for the summer and try to get something going in the fall.  Here's a list of ideas: - ballroom dancing - touch football - movie watching club - rock climbing (but I'd have to get into shape first) - music lessons of some sort (I'm looking at doing bluegrass banjo lessons at  urlLink The Old Town School of Folk Music  in the fall.  Yes, I know, it's a hotbed for White Guys with Dreadlocks.  I'll just have to deal with it.) - some sort of Buppie or aspiring Buppie (Black Yuppie) reading group. - martial arts  I just need to find a way to meet more fellow Negros and get my ass in gear.  Wish me luck.  Maybe I'll actually even follow through this time.
