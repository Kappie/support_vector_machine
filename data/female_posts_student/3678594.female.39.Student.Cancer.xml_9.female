These dishes are easy and fast [and delicious!]!   Beans and Pasta :  This is a staple dish in my house. I make it at least once a week!  Combine in a large skillet with a lid: 1/2 [19oz] can beans - cannellinni, black or kidney beans are all good 1 cup kernel corn 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon basil 1/2 teaspoon oregano 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1 [8oz] can tomato sauce 2 cups water  Bring to a boil and add: 2 cups dry pasta - I like fusilli or penne  Stir well. Bring back to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat about 15 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender. This makes a 'dry' pasta dish. If you like your pasta saucier, add a bit more tomato sauce or water.  Serves 3   Taco Soup :  This is my own version of the Taco Soup recipe in The McDougall Quick & Easy Cookbook. It can be as hot or as mild as you like!  Combine in a medium saucepan: 1 [19oz] can black beans 1 cup kernel corn 1 cup cooked brown rice 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 [8oz] can tomato sauce 1 cup salsa - your choice of heat A couple of teaspoons of taco seasoning Water to cover  Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat for about 15 - 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serves 3 - 4   Sausage Chowder :  This, again, is my own version of LoriM's Sausage Chowder, which periodically makes the rounds of the McDougall board at VegSource. This is the perfect, savory cold-weather meal and is superb with corn bread!  Combine in a medium saucepan: 1/2 pkg Yves Ground Round 1 large onion, chopped 1 [19oz] can red kidney beans 2 potatoes, diced 1/2 [28oz] can diced tomatoes 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon leaf sage 1/4 teaspoon marjoram 1/4 teaspoon thyme 1 bay leaf Water to cover  Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are soft. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serves 3 - 4
