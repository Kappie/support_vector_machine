The narrator lists sir Francis Drake and sir John Franklin as some of the "men of whom the nation is proud" (8).  He explains that all the ships heading out to the rest of the world passed through there.  The narrator describes the river's role as one of service to the people that live at its banks.  Primarily the narrator gets really poetic about the greatness of he Thames because all British conquest and imperialism extended from its mouth and flowed along its currents.  The narrator places great value on the river's role in the history of what he calls the greatest town on earth and admires the river greatly for it.
