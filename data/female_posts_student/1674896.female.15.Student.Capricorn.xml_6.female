It's awesome, but I'm only giving it to my friends so haha if you're not my friend, hah... ok I'll stop before I hurt somebody with my horrible comedic skills. ANYWAY... oh my gosh I can't get over how cool this new blog is! Amanda, I am so0o0o0o making a dedication page for you soon, lol. Hm... not too sure what else to write about now... oh I know!!! As most of you guys probably already know, I'm in ballet and have been for the past, like, 11 1/2 years. Anywho, I'm going to a ballet intensive in San Marcos from the 21st to the 26th. I'm happy about it though, because two of my friends will be there with me, Michelle and Emi. What I'm the most scared of though is that everyone from New West ballet (the school who is hosting the program) will be all like "perfect ballerinas," while I will be just standing in the back of the room stupified by my own uncoordinated, uh, dancing... hey now, I just made an oxymoron!!! Oh those are fun... ok new one, Jumbo Shrimp, hehe, hm, Stupid Genious, ha HAH, oh here's a good one... Microsoft Works. That's a keeper... ok I think I'm gonna go now... I 3 EVERYONE!!!
