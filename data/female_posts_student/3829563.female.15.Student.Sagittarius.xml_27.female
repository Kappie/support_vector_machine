All grandpa's life now is his kids and grandkids. thats it. he has no fucking life. and he doesnt deserve not having one. but i guess in some way thats just what happens when you're old, but see if my dad was here, oh boy, would he ever be good to him. i can tell you that my grandpa would be a much happier man. i want him to be happy. and now its like i should take up the obligation of having to take care of my grandpa, and "take over" my dad's "job", but i fucking cant, cos im in canada more than half the time. you know how we have to make sacrificies just like in spiderman? well maybe this is a sacrifice i have to make. you know, he doesnt have much time left in this world.. and in a way im willing to give up my dreams for the 5 or 6 years he has left. i dont really know how long he has left, but thats probably it considering he's been living on one lung for like 10 years.   and then theres my mom, she misses me like hell too when im gone. its never been a huge thing to me that i should make everyone happy instead of myself, but you know, an epiphany. i think most people know im just gonna say all this and not do anything about it, and i do agree in some ways. im a huge ass coward. i hate big changes. they just arent cool. but i want to be here when he leaves.. i just wish i knew how to speak whatever he speaks so i could tell him how much i love him. i hope he knows though.   fuck this sucks. okay as you may have guessed, i cried a river writing this. shower time. later people.
