Probably not, considering they were probably drunk, but does that mean they get excused from being responsible for their rude behavior.   i have many things that drive me crazy. people who talk in a movie theater (i dont care if its before the movie has started either. i pay to see the previews too, i should be allowed to hear them), people who actually dont turn off their phones in a theater and arent even embarrassed when they ring right in the middle of the movie. some have even answered their phone. do you really need to answer it to tell the caller that you are in a movie? you should feel bad enough that you interrupted the movie. click it off and they can call you back later. i'm also quite annoyed with people who leave shopping carts in the parking lots, in empty parking spots instead of walking them 2 feet to the shopping cart holder thingie. its not like alot of us couldnt use the exercise anyway.
