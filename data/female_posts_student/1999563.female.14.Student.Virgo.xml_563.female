Tonight has been kind of boring. I cleaned the house from 4-6 then I ate dinner. We had greek salad. I don't really like salad! It was pretty good though because it had cucumbers in it and I love cucumbers!!! My mom also cooked yummy bread!  Now I am just wandering around aimlessly waiting for tomorrow...lalala.  It wont be all that bad. :)  At first it will be bad but by sunday, it will all be better!  Speaking of sunday...I am going to Sara's soccer game on sunday! Woohooo!  Then on friday emily is coming over! Wooohoo!  Later Gators.  Your friend forever,  Laura Fantora
