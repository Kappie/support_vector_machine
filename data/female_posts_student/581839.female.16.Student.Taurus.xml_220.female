EVERY WINDOW. and at the second one, he fills up the gas tank...? anyway, this is my final one, and then i take my final test. i watched the prince and me with the family on saturday, and last week my mom surprised me and took me to pauls to get my hair cut, which is beautiful, and i went to a dance and realized that i really wanted a guy to hold hands with and who would think i'm the greatest, like in the prince and me. sigh. anyway, i have a lot of homework to do, and i'm creeped out because the yard men are cutting the lawn, but they keep staring in the windows at me and i'm really scared.... again.
