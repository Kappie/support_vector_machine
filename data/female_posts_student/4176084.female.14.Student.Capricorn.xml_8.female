Oh yeah, my mom's car broke down a week ago and the people at the car place told her how much it would cost to get it fixed today. 900 dollars. That's over 4 months of car payments. It sucks, as if we're not poor enough as it is. So since that happened, we're probably not gonna go go-karting or go to Albany with my dad as we planned, seeing he has all this week off. And I'm also not gonna go to "The Village" this weekend like my mom told me.  Yeah, my sisters are gonna stay at my grandparents house this weekend and my parents sleep all during the weekend. So I'm gonna be all alone. This week was supposed be awesome, but all because of the damned car it's gonna be as boring as hell.  We went to my grandparents house tonight I didn't do anything, besides annoy people. Oh yeah, I watched this ER show with Papa. It was all gorry and nasty, I was wincing just looking at all the blood and such. I hate those shows. But it's not like there was anything else to do. I am now using tonight as time to catch up on my fanfiction. So far I have 6 more chapters to go. I've decided to not work on Deviantart until I have everything else caught up on.
