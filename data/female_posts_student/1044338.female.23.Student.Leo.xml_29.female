Much bigger, a little newer, 2 full bathrooms, a basement above the freezing mark, and (most importantly in my opinion) a FIREPIT!!!  I've always wanted one and I think it'll be great in the summer just to sit around on a warm summer night, roast some marshmellows, and chill out.  We'll be having a party sometime when the snow is gone, and it's warm enough to wear shorts outside.  I can't wait.
