On-again-off-again boyfriend, best friend, worst enemy, future husband, support system. We have an odd relationship, but it's one of the strongest bonds in either of our lives. Current status = LURVE him to death, except for his ideology....  See, he was raised kinda-sorta in a  urlLink religious cult . The Way International? Yeah. I mean,  urlLink this (Christian) ministry  has good religious habits, and they've done a lOT of research that's pretty damn important in the Christian world, but most people in it are also weird.   He lived for two years on a ministry communal farm thing.  However, since his mother's divorce of a "Ministry man," and the implied shunning from so many of those people, their family pretty much can't stand the Way any more, so they just worship outside of it.   ANyway, he's got a very strong background in Christianity, and a freakish amount of historical knowledge stored in his brain. I'm talking, this is that freshman who tested out of AP history classes. This is the guy I use when I'm writing papers and studying for history classes. He just RETAINS it. So, of course, he has all kinds of religious history committed to memory.  He doesn't walk around talking about it, and most people don't even know his religion because he's very laid-backa bout his faith, but in truth, he's Christian through and through.  Being agnostic myself, there are a few issues we just will never ever agree on, ever. One of these is homosexuality. B is all, "Homos homos homos, gross gross gross, Bible Bible Bible." I'm all "SYmpathy sympathy sympathy, humanism humaism humanism, rights rights rights." It doesn't work. At any rate, one of his endearing nicknames is "my little homophobe," which is actually pretty dysfunctional, but it still makes me laugh.  So a few nights ago we were talking on the phone and at some point he remarked that he couldn't think of anything worse than having to watch two men have sex. Sick of his "gay" problems, I pointed out that there were much worse things to watch. When asked for an example, I brought in a disgusting comment made by one of our other wall-humping male teenage friends earlier in the day, and suggested bestiality. He denied it.  Basically, I'd rather watch gay people have sex than a person and a horse, and he's rather see the other.   I'm not so sure why this is relevant to anything, except that it reminds me of the "Bush or Kerry?" question..... pick between two undesirable things?  Now, unless you're both gay AND bestial, this is probably somewhat YUCK for you..... still, I'd like to play this age-old game and ask, what would YOU rather watch, is you had to watch one? (The sex, not the Presidents.)
