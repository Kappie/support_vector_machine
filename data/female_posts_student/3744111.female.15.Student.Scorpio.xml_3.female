Well right after I fell my sister started screaming *Way to wake people up Lynette* and just kept yelling at me I was like * ok don't help me up i might just die here from a concussion*...   Well I took my shower and i got online and my little sister comes downstairs and turns the Tv on and wakes up my little brother and he yells at her for waking him up... So my little brother tries to get online in the other room but can't because i am on so he comes and yells at me ... well i am hungry anyway so i am gonna go and eat and let my brother on i will update possibly more then onces a day now that i am starting to drive...Bye bye
