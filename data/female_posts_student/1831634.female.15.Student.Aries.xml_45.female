LIFE turning circles peripherally floating out of grasp so close! fluttering, floating, straining... pop!.  isn't that a lovely inpromptu poem?  no, it's not, and i hate life with a passion right now.  i am about to kill some people.  i want to just go to school and come home and bomb all my tests and sleep for twenty hours and not think of anything at all.  i want to be in love with a normal, nice person and not have to think about the real world at all.  and then i'll kill him.  i want for jack to be a barber and cut hair and for all of us to go to a barbershop and commune and it would be like the butterflies and we'd be free and happy and lovely.  i hate didy and jeff.  i want to eat until i blow up.  i want to throw up anger.  i want to murder and then get murdered.  ++sunny
