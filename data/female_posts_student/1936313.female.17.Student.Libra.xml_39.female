Have you ever had one of those nightmares where you can't quite tell if you've woken up or if your still dreaming? I think I just locked myself into one of them.... I woke up to the phone ringing around 9:05... Strathcona Highschool calling.... wanting to know where my baby brother was because he didn't show for his Social Studies final exam which started at 9:00...  I called his cell phone. No answer, left a message.  I called Dad's cell phone. No answer, left a message.  I ran around the house screaming in case he thought this was some kind of funny joke. No answer.  My stomachs in knots, I'm not normally prone to panic attacks.. but i haven't slept and... if not for the fact I fell up the stairs and hit my knee pretty hard... I'd swear I was still dreaming.  Where are they?
