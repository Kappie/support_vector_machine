I'm thinking about going to bed early tonight. Nah... sleep is for the weak.  My hair appointment is for tonight at 7pm with Mike at Heidi's Hair Salon at Briarwood Mall. I'm excited. Change is good.  So yesterday turned out to be pretty fucking bad aswell. Well, sort of. When I got out of work I was taking Brentt home and as I was backing up my back-up sensors went off, but I thought it was the curb. WRONG. Turned out to be Big Rog's car, and I hit it then sped off after check for no damage. I was in a hurry to take Brentt home and then make it to the mall for some pre-weekend shopping. I got an e-mail when I returned home. He was pissed. I know his car is already fucked up, but I feel horrible for fucking it up even worse. I should have checked my e-mail before leaving for "school." Nick and Tiki convinced me it'll all blow over but I'm the biggest screw up in the world this week.  (I'm leaving out our events at Kinkos Copy Shop for obvious reasons)  I got the best feeling in the world last night. Michelle and I were driving East on I-94, on our way back from Kinkos and I said something like, "We're partners in crime... some kind of modern day Thelma and Louise." And she replied with something like, "That's awesome. I've never had a partner. It'll be cool." I got that warm fuzzy feeling deep down inside.   I think I'm actually waking up now.  Tomorrow is Friday!!! Ahhh! I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight. Kettering here I come!
