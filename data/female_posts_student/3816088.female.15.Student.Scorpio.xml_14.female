I really have nothing exciting to post today but I am just soo bored tha i though I would post something anyways. i have been sooo bored lately and tonight is a prime example. I am supposed to be packing for Hawaii but Im going to do that tomorrow afternoon. Tonight though Im just doing stupid things to past time. i mean I have been through every single picture on my computer that my dad has put on here and also I read my brothers eagle scout award invitation thingy because it was in the shared things and I was curious. This is soo sad! i have even VOLUNTEERED to make the bed in the extra bedroom and even lifted weights with my little brother in his room to try to become un bored but is it happening...NO! I want to go out and drive but my brother has my car :'( (yes its my car!! dont listen to what he says) Well I am going to go and just continue to be bored.  Toodles! Heather
