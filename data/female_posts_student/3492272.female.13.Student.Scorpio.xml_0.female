I wanted to get my hair trimmed not even 2 inches and my mom said she couldn't do it so I was like never mind then my dad said he would do it... OH - NO... But I said only an inch and he was like I know I know and then I was Like have you ever cut some ones hair before and he was like yea.. Well All I have to say is never let a guy cut your hair.... When he was almost don't I touched my hair and It felt like it was all gone.. So I looked in the mirror and It was WICKED short!!!!! O-well I'll adjust sooner or la8ter.. WEll I got to go think of what I can do to make it look good..~XOXOXO~.. **MEGZ**
