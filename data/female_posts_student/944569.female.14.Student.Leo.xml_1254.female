Wouldn't it be hilarious if Spanish class had to present this as a song instead of Muralla?  he's a Spanglish rapper!  XD  Rico Suave Gerardo  Seguro que han oído que yo soy educado Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado Un joven responsible y siempre bien vestido Yo no se quien ha mentido  I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope My only addiction has to do with the female species I eat 'em raw like sushi  No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno Si me enterno, you me enfermo Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura No me vengan con ternuras  So please don't judge a book by its cover There's more to being a latin lover You got to know how to deal with a woman That won't let go The price you pay for being a gigolo  There's not a woman that can handle A man like me That's why I juggle two or three I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit You pop the question that's it Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres Y la situaci?all?no muere No es un delito calmo mi apetito Con un llanto o un grito  So again don't let my lyrics mislead you I don't love you but I need you Would you rather have me lie Take a piece of your pie and say bye Or be honest and rub your thighs  Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late I never said I was a prompt date But you kept persisting that I meet your parents Huh, they're going to love my appearance  Ding dong el timbre suena Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no para bola Que se ha creido vieja chola  Go and serve the food mom Que tengo ambre If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre Y usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor? Sierra la boca por favor  What's this amor, these little huevos? Esto s?que yo no pruebo  I'm used to good ol' fashioned Homestyle Spanish cooking If i try that I'll be puking Well it's been a pleasure but we got to go Regresaremos temprano Cinco, seis, o siete de la mañana Su hija esta en buenas manos
