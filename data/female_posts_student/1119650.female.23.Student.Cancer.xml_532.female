So yesterday everyone on all the news channels were telling us that the world is gonna blow up with snow and we're all gonna die and have to live in igloos and eat one another.  So in anticipation of this I stayed up til 2 a.m. drinking, laughing, watching movies and having snowball fights with everyone.  A treacherous adventure to McDonalds was a fun time thanks to  urlLink Aidan, my trusty Pathfinder  and it brought tasty treats to the whole apartment.    Once Upon A Time In Mexico was a pretty decent flick (a lil gory if I do say so myself), but I dunno if it was worth all those Miller Lite burps or the fact that I'm running on no sleep wahtsoever in order to be here at work today.  And for what?  No one is even here anyhow (well except the FabUlous Twan) and I did score points b.c I saw my cool boss walking to work and I stopped and picked her up.  It was pretty good in that respect.  Now I've got a stomach ache and Im cranky though.  Oh well only 2 hrs left to go before I can go home and get my nap on.
