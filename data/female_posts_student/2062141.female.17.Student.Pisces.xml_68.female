But you know what that means: FREE TIME which means *gasp* MUSIC! So that brightened up my day. Let's see... Rusenko's mother died or something so he'll be gone all week... greaaaaaat... I've missed so much and I don't know how to do anything in that class. Rrrrrr. Then I was just feeling so magnanimous that I gave Andy a ride. Wow i'm so nice today. (?).  No i'm just a pushover. Gaa you know it's bad when you frustrate YOURSELF. Looks like Michelle Duffie will probably be the one to take my last Jason Mraz ticket,            ...which is TOMORROW... yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!          Hey maybe that's why I was so happy today. Well, besides just being sad that Nick and Charlotte are having problems (be okay! NOW!) which normally when a couple is having problems I really don't care (alot of couples are so fucking annoying i'd be GLAD if they broke up), but since they're my best friends it kinda sucks.... because of the sadness and whatnot and how I hear it from both sides and try to stay neutral (in most situations). I know it'll all smooth out. I really think so. Most of the time I just try to lighten the mood by saying something dumb and make them laugh. But Charlotte, this was a problem! I really did forget my locker combination! LoL.  It was one of those days. But it's okay, Jason Mraz will make you feel alllllright! Lalalalovely.          One thing I'll never understand is how couples suddenly melt their seperate lives into one. Like how every single thing you do has to either involve the other, or has to be cleared by the other. Aren't you both still seperate people? I mean, that person can be very important to you, but that doesn't mean you need to lead the same lives. Maybe I'd understand if I'd ever gotten that close for so long to someone. Someday, when I'm in that situation to understand, I'll erase this... but until then....        Anyways I still have massive amounts of homework to do so I should go. RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR God why don't I just become a freaking nun.  ***** I'd be quite the sexy nun....  I'd fly. I'd fight crime.  It's sounding better all the time!  'Cept for the no men thing. Dammit. There goes that idea...  I'd be the most atheist nun ever.
