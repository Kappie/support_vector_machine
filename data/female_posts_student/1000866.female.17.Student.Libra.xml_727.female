Most of my section have serious problems concentrating and I just get so frustrated a lot. It was different when I was the one having a small conversation in the section. Heh. I'm feeling Peter's pain right now. Erica's really trying to help though and suggest some stuff and she's been a good role model for the entire section. So, thanks Erica. :) I appreciate it. Hmmm...what color mood am I in?
