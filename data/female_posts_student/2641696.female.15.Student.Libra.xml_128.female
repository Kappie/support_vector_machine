Let this, however, be known: he sent me such a cute anime thing! So yes, I am in love with him because he sent me an adorable anime video. I am loving the video through him, you see. It all makes perfect sense. And did I ever mention that he is very very gorgeous? Like he really is. Like really. Like really really really.   He's smart, too, but that's not nearly as important as the really-really-reallies.   My sister is coming home today with a friend. This makes me mad, because I hate it when her friends sleep over. They are usually shrill, loud and tall. And they insist on banging doors and whispering and giggling, which bugs me. Also, N goes like super-sonic-hyper when friends are over, and just goes... well, best way to put it would be 'chirpy.' It is very unnatural. I'm not used to N being super-sonic-hyper like that; it is strange, and I don't like it. This is why I am mad that she is having a friend over for a sleepover.   Other than that, I've very little to say. I'm going to the renn faire on Sunday, which will be cool. I am wearing a funky hat, but not the one I bought last year there. I'm wearing my Quebec hat. It's cool and I like it. And I'm pretty close to reaching 25,000 words, which will be a happy-sad moment. I have to re-do practically everything in the first two/three chapters *sigh* But that's ok. I'll do that later. For now, I think I am just going to surf on the wave of creativity.   Peace.   heheheehehee...
