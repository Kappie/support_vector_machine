Even though I was worried about playing off my scales and my french oral. But...got 100's on both, so it made me alot happier. Too bad I have C's in my other two classes.My GPA is officially ruined. But I just don't care anymore. Meh.  Oh, by the way, yesterday was a funny day. Just everything made me laugh till I peed. Only not quite....well, off to....do something else I suppose.  Later crazies.
