It was so heartbreaking, yet, it did remind me to always have hope despite insurmountable odds.   “Life is too short to be taken seriously.”   We should make time to experience all the things we haven’t done yet, or the time might catch up and unknowingly, we missed the chance to have done so.   Though this life taught me more than I’ve bargained, if given a chance to change some moments in my life, I wouldn’t erase one bit of moment I had. I had a little bit of everything, and nothing, still these things made me stronger, and tougher. Despite any other odds, I know that in the near future I’ll be able to face them and win.   Getting hurt and moving on, is part of the process of living. Like they said, “when you hit the bottom, there’s no way but up”. There might be times when I hoped I could have had a more peaceful and simpler life, but you never know what to expect.   Now, I know that I still have a long way to go, if ever God will bestow upon me a longer life. The only thing that would keep me going is the thought that everything happens for a reason, if I commit a mistake, then let it be an experience, if I love someone, then it’s destiny, if I get hurt, it was never meant to be…and if I do get married, it’s forever.
