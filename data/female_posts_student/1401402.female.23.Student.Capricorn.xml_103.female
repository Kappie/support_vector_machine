Four hours of bullshitting, smooth conversation, smart talk, and dirty talk, messing around, you name it. Once we reach south Tahoe, everything that surrounded us was so beautiful, it was lovely, it was nice. Sitting in the car with three guys makes a big different. I was like this little kid who have never seen snow before. I was like look look look over there, look over here, down there, up there, look at that other side, look at the mountains, look at the lake. WOW…. I was just so excited.    Once we got to the hotel, unpacked, rested, then off we went straight to the buffet at Harrah’s. The wait was an hour and forty five minutes. We bounce; end up at a different restaurant similar to apple bees. I had a big dinner, and I found myself playing with my food like always. After dinner everyone did a little of gambling, I stood around because I didn’t feel lucky at all. Once we got back to the hotel, a few friends had gone out to the spa. I could have gone but I didn’t have any swim suit to wear.  It was freezing outside; it was probably 20 - 30° or so. I couldn’t stand the cold so I went to bed.    I’ve got to say that sleeping at an unknown place really freaked me out. I kept on tossing and turning. The pillow was way too flat and it hurts my neck. I found myself waking up every hour. I look towards the glowing digits on the clock, 4:47 am!!! I thought I was the only one that was awake so I started to sing to myself.  I heard a voice cracking up with my singing skills. It was Ben!!! So we stood there talking about so many things that I don’t even remembered. Twenty minutes later everyone in the room was up. We watched cartoons til 7:30 am. Shower, put on our snow pants, snow jackets, load four boards into the car, got everything and everyone and off we went to mickey d’s.    Nine in the morning, we head out to heavenly resort. At last we come to it, breathing in fresh morning icy cold crispy thin air. At last, yes, its time to gear up, got our boards check, my camera check, my beanie check, my gloves check, my Chap Stick check, my glasses check, everyone was ready check, got our lift ticket check. We were all good to go; off we went onto the ski lift. I sat with Ben, we were so calm, and it was so peaceful then off the lift we went. The landing was smooth, everyone finishes strapping in and double check all their bindings and off we went.    While taking off we were all going so fast, Harvey pulled onto me and I pulled onto Ben. I fell on my tail bone that exploded to my stomach area then I felt the pain heading up to my back spine. I couldn’t move even if I tried to. All I could say was “Help, help me out of people’s way, I cant move, pull me to the side”. I sounded like an old lady who was helpless. I was in pain. I felt like crying. I didn’t know what to do but just go with the flow. Everyone pulled me to the side hoping that I was okay. I could barely walk; I had to lie in the snow for a while. At this point I was still up on the hills, feeling pretty dizzy. I was about a mile away from the lift.    An hour went by, everyone’s having fun, I see them fall, scrub, having a great time and me, I’m still in pain but at least I could sit up. The second hour, I could move, I made a snow angel and I also made three snowmen but I was still in pain. The third hour I got up and stretch, the pain kinda fade away and I can walk. Friends gather around me making sure I can get down the hill without hurting myself even more. Had lunch and off we went on the ski lifts again.    I didn’t want to give up even tho I was in a great pain. This time it was different, I had Ben holding on to me making sure I wont fall. He was taking care of me and I must say that he’s done a very great job. I fell many many times and of course I drag Ben alone with me. I fell on top of him; he fell on top of me. We’ve almost kissed a few times, just by looking at each other made both of us crack up even harder.  It was fun, really fun, hella fun. One great moment. At the end I fell again, this time I land on my tail bone once more. I gave up for the day, I was in pain again and couldn’t go on anymore.    Afterwards Ben brought me down the hill, he sat with me for awhile until he was sure that I will be okay. The last word he said to me before he goes was, “Hang in there, I’ll be back for you.”  Up the lift, down the hill, up the lift, off the lift and down the hill again. Waiting for another hour wasn’t so bad. The day was over and back to the car, back to the hotel room, rested for an hour and got ready for dinner.    All of a sudden I realized that Ben must have had a thing for me. Since when? I didn’t realized it but he kept making eye contact with me. Always asked me if I was okay. Making eye contact with Ben was a different feeling from making eye contact with anyone else. Suddenly I felt the comfort of Ben, helding me in the snow, twirling around, flirting, and speaking our minds. After knowing Ben for over five years I have never had this kinda feeling before. We both have a lot in common, we’re good friends. This is actually the very first time I felt like this for him. Whats going on?????      Anyways we had dinner at Harrah’s, this time no waiting in line. We went rite through and ate rite away. Every one of us was so exhausting. I, was still in pain, limping, I needed a cane for when I walk.  After dinner we went straight to the casino. I went straight to the slots. Wheels of Fortune, I spent twenty bucks and only twenty bucks for over three hours. I was winning big but I got so greedy and end up loosing one hundred bucks after five hours.    That night, I slept at the edge of the bed, thinking. Why am I feeling like this towards Ben? He was on the next bed with David facing me. I was on the opposite bed from his with two other friend facing him. Other friends were across the room from us. Again I was tossing and turning. Ben was doing the same thing. I try to ignore him and went to sleep and not think about anything. Every time I was awake I would sing or humm to myself and his always responding back. David was snoring so loud that Ben couldn’t stand it anymore. Ben got up and recorded David’s snoring. When he plays back the recording, it sounded like David was moaning. We were all hella making fun of him, laughing and joking about it.     Waking myself up from a dream that I hope it isn’t going to come true. In that dream I saw Ben staring at me constantly. Six in the morning, I was up, trying so hard to go back to sleep but I couldn’t. Again I humm and Ben responded. I turn and he was lying there staring at me. God, this is creeping me out. I was nervous, I didn’t say anything. We got up and got ready for a new day. We all got ready for breakfast.    The same thing reputably happened, Ben staring at me!!! I dunno what it is that makes me felt this way towards Ben but it seems like he couldn’t take his eyes off me for some apparently reason. I really cant explain what I am feeling inside but I’m trying to avoid this feeling. Everytime we talked we were on the same page, songs, life experiences, deep thoughts, etc. There was a moment after breakfast when everyone had to take a dump. I left with the girls to the second floor hoping that no one will find us. Once I was done and walked outside to the waiting area, there was Ben. Everywhere I went Ben was there. Whats sup with this. The harder I try to avoid him the more I see him.   Waking up after two hours during a car ride, Ben looked at me through the view mirror. I was paranoid. Stop and got gas and had lunch at popeyes, the same thing with the eye contact. Got home unpacked, shower and went to bed, thought of Ben. Went to sleep dreamt of Ben. Woke up thought of how Ben looked at me. Got coffee this morning someone had called out Ben’s name. Got to work, many lenders who is looking for their policy with the name Ben. Everywhere I go I have to hear Ben. This is really freaking me out of my mind.    I dunno who to tell or who to talk to but to write and write and write and post this shit onto my blog. Hoping that someone will give me some advice soon. I just hope that I can exclude myself out of this feeling. To me Ben is just a very good friend that I can really count on. Although I must admit that I did flirt with him in some kinda way. I spoke my mind when I am around him because he doesn’t take anything seriously. But please tell me why am I feeling this way? Can I stop thinking of him anytime soon? Will he leave my mind and my dreams?
