Shane finally blogged and he's in love and i'm truly happy for him because he's a really wonderful guy.  Today i decided that i will be happy. being depressed and morose is fun and all, but it's just not a big enough challenge. i think a blissfull facade will be a nice change of scenery. and like i told heather, i may be dead on the inside, but people don't bother to look there and happy people have more friends.   Perhaps that is everyone in this houses' problem... nobody strives for happines, they don't make attempts to amuse themselves. which only brings us back to  the laziness of america and yahta yahta . who cares.  I finally finished my powerpoint. it was a bitch, and now i have to find a goddamn renaissance costume. if i can't make do((due, dew, doo?)) with something from mom's closet, i'll have to call the costume folks super quick. god i am such a procrastinator!
