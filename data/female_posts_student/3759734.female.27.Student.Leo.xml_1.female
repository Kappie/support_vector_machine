Yea I know I should have and could have said no but I didn't. I dislike when I have to help someone especially when it is family and they have a problem and u try to bring them into your world and they find a way to fuk up things, that is y I like to be bymyself then I wouldn't have to worry about that nonsense at all, but when it comes to a point when it the person is starting to deserves u it is time for them to go give them all 5 toes in the butt :)
