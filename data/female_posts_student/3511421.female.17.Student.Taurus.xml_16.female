While at first I was tricked into believing I enjoyed my spanish class, I have recently discovered my teacher is none other than the anti-christ. I started some crazy drawings, maybe if i fill the whole page I'll post it. I saw Harry Potter, enough said. Oh Donnie Darko how I love thee so! I watched it twice in a row and then once more with the commentary. I'm convinced if he was real, we'd be soulmates. CDs I have to buy: Mogwai-Happy Songs for Happy People. Ok, nevermind it's only one, but i am being lazy and refuse to backspace. I've been offered the opportunity to travel wherever i want for 4 nights. First thought that comes to mind: diving. Cayman Islands. Maybe, I'm not 100 percent sure yet. Feel free to share any thoughts. Tommorow I have a Birmingham Belles Luncheon so yes, I get to stand around in a pretty dress for no reason. Sickening, I know. I might post those pictures too. Well that's all i got.  Current Song: StellaStar - My Coco :) P.S. Rent "Melvin Goes to Dinner". You won't regret it. Make it a blockbuster night.
