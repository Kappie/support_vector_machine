I'm sick of everyone being pissed off with me cuz I swear, I will friggin' kill myself right now... or at least alla  THEM ...  It really started 'bout two or three days ago when my dad's fiancee comes up to me and asks if I drank the pineapple juice and left like a half inch of juice in the bottom of the carton. I told the truth and was like " I don't remember, but I don't think I've had any pineapple juice in about a week. " She says okay and goes off about her business. Later that night, she goes, " I talked to your dad and he says he didn't drink it, so you lied to me. ".....   WHAT?!   I'm like " I told you, I don't remember drinking it or nothing, so how am I lying about something I didn't know if I did or not? " and she goes " You shouldn't have lied to me, though " and I just walk away and forget about it because if it had gone any further, I was gonna lose it and start screaming at her.   I think a little bit before that they told me I couldn't use the computer over the weekend because I didn't tell them we were out of fabric softner... like I'm the ONLY one who does laundry in my house. Ugh.   Then today, I got yelled at by my dad, the principal, and about three teachers for not attending my school's educational awards. I was supposed to recieve the first ever Orlando Rosario scholarship ( Orlando died due to gang violence last year ), but I thought I was only getting an award for excellence in math, so I didn't go. I didn't WANT to go. So I find out today and everyone's all like " You were supposed to show up and everyone was so embarassed that you didn't show up and we had to tell the family that you had a family emergency. " SHUT UP! I DIDN'T KNOW!!!! I wrote a letter to the family, but of course, my dad's like " We're taking the computer out your room and don't ask to do anything this weekend. " Great. I've been getting chewed up all day and it's pissing me off.     It makes slitting your wrists seem fun.  Believe me.    I tried.       -SmOokie
