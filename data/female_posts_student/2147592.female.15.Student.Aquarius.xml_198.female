Yesterday me, Tab, Billy and Will were at...Will's and we had a big dreaming session and it was so cool! The mixes and stuff. When we had to go I did a good though...  So we managed to get home in the end. At the moment I'm round Pig's, it's been fun but him and Nips will soon be deserting me and Tab...to fester with his friends...  SoI will either be joining Miss Loretta South...or I'll be joining Mr Bedschleeper (My bed :S) Well yeah...going to go now because I'm not feeling usual and my arms ache.
