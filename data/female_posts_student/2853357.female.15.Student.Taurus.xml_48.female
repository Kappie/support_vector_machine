(prolly get carpol tunnel disease in the process, but do i care?  maybe in the future...)  oh ya, and reading. because freshmen year was pretty damn close to hell, so i'm taking ALL 3 MONTHS TO DO ABSOLUTLY FREAKEN NOTHING!   except typing, reading, and bugging my cousins friends online.... with the possible trip somewhere.... just fyi  and it's been REALLY windy over here like you can't believe!  i found this relli funni clip online called  urlLink 'the odyssey'  FUNNI! a stick figure clip, but funni...  um... thats about it folks.  have a nice life!  •patty•
