And well Social was alright but I kinda totally blew up at Chelsey and I feel really bad.  It was kind of something like this "I just don't understand, and if you try to help me how will that be different?  Everytime someone explains it I never understand.  I am so sick of never understanding and sick of trying and never getting anything. I never understand anything and teacher probably thinks I am like the stupiest person in her class.  It's just really frustrating."  Now that I think of what I said I sound so negative towards myself and I wish like yesterday the math teacher said, all I need if confidence but sometimes it's so hard to have that because I mean I really am not doing too well in Chem.  My feelings are something like this right now:     What I am Feeling Today  So tired  SICK  Trying to understand  Just do not get it   Frustrated  UPSET  Unhappy,  Underestimated  Wish that I would know   How do I make things right?  Correct mistakes  MARKS  So down, so down below   Is this just me?  The way I feel  Am I the only one?  How can I know?   Chem quiz  tommorow  Studying soon  Feel it is so important  Gotta make it through   Just when I can only think  things just might get better  Worse it seems to my eye  Light or Darkness now?   Crying in the silence of  my heart so deep and solid  breaking up the pieces so  to make them all but one part   Thinking in this gift of mine  What shall I do?  I'm so confused right now  All I want is to make it through   ~Vanessa
