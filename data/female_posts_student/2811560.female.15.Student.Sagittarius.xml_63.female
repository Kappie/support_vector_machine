Anyways, Richie was high AGAIN! It was really funny because I guess he had this big presentation to do in Music Theory, yet he decided to get high...whatever. He started walking around the band room without shoes on, yep that's our Richie! Lol. So yeah, Emily, Bob, Paul and I are going to see Troy tomorrow and then maybe to Aurelio's to get something to eat. I'm so excited...I'm getting butterflies just talking about it. Is that supposed to happen? Oh well. Finals start two weeks from today, thank god! I'm so ready for this year to be over...I'm really starting to slack off. I don't know. I am seriously about to shoot myself in chorus. Its just soooo remedial! I feel like I'm learning my ABC's all over again. I've been reading music since I was five, I really don't need to be doing worksheets on note names and time signatures. Grr. And its going to be just as bad next year. So I'm thinking I MIGHT get an A in algebra, if I try really hard. I'm like 2 percentage points below an A, and I took a quiz today that was really easy. So if I do well on the quiz and ace my final...maybe. Just maybe...
