I guess I can find sumthin else to do. Maybe the movies... or bowling. Or sumthin... Thanks Mr. Fisher for the lovely driving comment: Oh, and by the way - be careful out there - I hear Shelby is on the road - do I hear the sound of screeching tires and the screams of nice old ladies crossing the road???????  I miss Mark...
