There’s this section ‘Notes’ where he apparently writes a daily journal for the 21 days before his 21st birthday. There are four years in there, 1999-2002. I’ve read 1999 and 2000 so far.   I’m taking it slow cos I want to savour it. Hehe. Neh, its just his thoughts in general and all that. It’s just interesting to read. Really interesting. Typically American, you could say. I wouldn’t go through the same things as he would. But its just so interesting looking from another person’s window out to the world of life.   In other words, I’m nosy. Hah.   I like reading people’s thoughts. What really goes on inside their heads. That’s why I like to read people’s blogs I guess. Even I don’t really know that person well, I like to read what they are thinking. Totally first person point of view. Me, me, me..   It’s something you wouldn’t normally hear if you were spending time with the person. It’s stuff that don’t come out verbally. But only moves silently in the vicinities of the mind. They only come out when you’re alone. Not physically alone but your mind isn’t distracted with something else.   Blah, I don’t know what I’m trying to say already.   Oh yeah, one more person who’s online journals are nice- Jason Mraz. I don’t know. Maybe I just like his style. They seem more personal and not just something he’d like to say to his fans. Spilling it all out spontaneously is just so wonderful and shnogzzling, as Roald Dahl would say.   Full of shnogzzles, Mary-Ruth  Ps-   wow I’m on such a blogging-spree today. But I won’t have much time once school starts. I can feel the busy vibes already. They are coming, oh, rushing towards me!
