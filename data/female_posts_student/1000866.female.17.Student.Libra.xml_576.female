I just wrote this whole like....nine paragraph long thing to vent then realized again that this thing is public and I probably shouldn't put 8 and 1/2 of those 9 paragraphs in here.   My day was one of those days. I'm really thankful to Carson though. She cheered me up so much. Her and Kevin Lewis. Aw. I love them. :) They made me feel so much better after such a crappy morning. There's so much going on right now and half of it I can't talk about with anyone. I wish I could call Chris right now. I really need him.
