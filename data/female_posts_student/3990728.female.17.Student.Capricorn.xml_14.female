I was working drive thru packing and she was up front. The guy running drive thru, (my work buddy Brandon), was out smoking and she had a up front one customer that she was packing an order for then two people waiting for their order to be taken. I was busy trying to pack for people waiting out side for food. She calls her someone to ring up the next order, she would collect on it so I take a quick break to ring them up then I rush back to drive thru to finish packing. Then she starts bitching cuz I rang the order and didn't pack it! HELLO! 01)She never said she needed someone to pack it. After all there wasn't many people up front. 02)It wasn't my job to even be up there. 03)I had people waiting for food too. She wasn't the only one working. God I have so many problems and the ones at work usually start with her. Work isn't my only problems. One is also my father. Surprise surprise. He went school clothes shopping without me, the clothes are ugly, and I feel rude saying they are to him. I have no clue what to do.
