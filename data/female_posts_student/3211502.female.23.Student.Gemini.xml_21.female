The people who are on the show don't really seem like they need it. It seems like they have emotional issues that they need to resolve and they're using the plastic surgery as a quick fix. But, don't get me wrong, the people who are on the show do seem to be dramatically affected by their "makeover."   Anyways, watching this show made me think back to my "makeover." I didn't turn in a video to ABC proclaiming how badly I needed one. I just got dumped by a guy and that motivated me to take action. After obsessive-compulsive exercising and borderline anorexic behavior (just kidding!), I am the me that I am now. :)  Here's me in 2001. Aka the "before" photo:
