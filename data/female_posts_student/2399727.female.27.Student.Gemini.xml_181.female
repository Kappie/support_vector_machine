I first saw  urlLink Mattie on Oprah  a few years ago and was deeply touched by his poetry and his positive attitude.  He is the author of five books, all bearing the title "Heartsongs" in some form.  His website lists his motto as: "Think gently, speak gently, live gently."  Doesn't that ring true in our dealings not only with others but also with ourselves.  What a truly inspiring young man and a portrait of courage even while enduring difficult health problems.     Sleep gently, Mattie.  More to come...
