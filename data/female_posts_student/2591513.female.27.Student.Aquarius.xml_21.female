I have frequented a few people's blog and always considered doing one, but never got around to it.  So I am very NEW to all this.  I mostly started this as a sounding board for all my ups and downs...Mostly because I have been going through crazy mood swings thanks to my wonderful pregnancy.  Don't get me wrong, I am HAPPY about being pregnant, but when it is your fourth child and you were on b/c...Well let's just say it caught me off guard.  I am crazy about my kids, but they drive me crazy as well.  Plus I am struggling to finish college (I have 2 more years left...Give or take).  I am nearing a birthday and let's just say that I wanted to be done with college a long time ago...But on that same note, I don't regret the choices I made.  It brought me to a very loving husband, Ed, and three beautiful children, Bailey, Nalani and Emily.  So anyway, here I am, no due date as of yet...All day I have had cramps and a little bit of spotting.  Everyone says it is normal and that if anything happens...It happens.  Although I am ill prepared for this child, I don't want to lose it either.  One of those things I guess.  So needless to say I am EXTREMELY moody and my poor husband is getting the grunt of it.  I love him for his patience...I hope he survives this pregnancy...  So that's it for a first entry...Boring, I know...But what can I say?
