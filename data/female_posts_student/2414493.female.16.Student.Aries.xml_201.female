Ellis is telling me a random story about undercooked fish and climbing mountains and goats. Hi Ellis.  Just had chili and cheese with chips. Awfully fattening, I know, but it's good. I haven't been able to stop eating lately, and it bothers me. It shows, too. The planned alternative was eating a bit at school, coming straight home and napping.  Just for Jess, I'm posting now.
