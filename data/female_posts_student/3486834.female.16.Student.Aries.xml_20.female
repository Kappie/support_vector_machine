I wanted to go to the carnival again, but my mom was being gay. She's on the rags tho. Again, it sucks for me!  I'm trying to look for some pics of me on glamour shots. We got pictures taken there a long time ago.. I still want to see them. They are considered sacred to my mom, so I am not aloud to touch the real pictures. I want to have some on my computer.. I hope it works. I sorta wish that I went out of town today, cause it was Emily's birthday party. I really wanted to see all of my old friends. It sux that it didn't work out. So now I think we are leaving next saturday or this wednesday. it hasn't been made too clear to me.  I am still trying to figure out how i can add links and pictures to my blog. Jon wants me to go to church with Jennifer.. I have no clue why.. I should get back to doing nothing. Later
