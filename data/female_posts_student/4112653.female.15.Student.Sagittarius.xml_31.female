"Why won't you die?" tittanya sounded interested, not angry.   Picking Marion up, she carried her over to a bathtub in the next room. Placing Marion in the bathtub as a mother would put her child to bed, Tittanya began to run a bath.   Bending over Marion, Tittanya slashed open her own wrist. After letting herself bleed for a couple of seconds, Tittanya picked up a roll of guaze and wrapped her wrists to stop the bleeding, then moved out of the room.   "Now to destroy the evidence." Those were the last words Marion would ever hear.
