Such is life... Mr Sun has decided to visit Melbourne for the day and I do hope he comes again tomorrow..I love looking outta my window as the sun sets...even though I can only see the chimney roof tops of my block's houses but the combination of backyard trees and paved roofs give me a Charles Dickens feel...Hmmm.. my thesis chapter is not forming...Haiya, I really don't know what to do with it...but will still try to squeeze out something for Tuesday... Need some inspiration rite now... Ommmmmpppppppphhhhh...  I slept more than 10hrs and woke up feeling much better.. I muz hav kinda overwork myself unknowingly... my body is aching and if I can go back into bed, I'll... I'm eating junk again... had Indo mee with egg cooked sunny side up, 2 sticks of ice-cream and of coz my sago and gula melaka that I'm trying to finish... I'm gonna abstain from TV tonite urm except for Gilmore Gals... how can I miss it... I mite cook claypot chicken rice but using the rice cooker... and tofu and egg soup...let see how depends on my mood later...  Talking abt mood.. I was talking to Terence earlier.. hmm.. I don't know how to put it in words but juz that he shld hav been more thoughtful in regards to his actions... what if he met an accident... I'll be such a wreck... what if he dies... I'll be so devastated... I know this is bringing things to an extreme sense but that's what so many other people say when things turn wrong..."I didn't think it'll happen to me" or "I regret what I did"... you may say that's one in a million chance of occurrence but there's still a chance of it happening... I don't see myself as beinging unreasonable or even controlling.. I juz hope that Terence can see my point of view... I can't wait for these 2 weeks to pass by quickly..  Ahhh...the warm glow of Mr Sun is on my face... so nice and warm... What a joy to live and to love!!
