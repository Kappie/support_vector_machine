All in all a joyous occasion fun for the whole family. The competition part was kind of hopeless. The judges were really easy. We got 2 emeralds, 3 diamonds, and the rest were all rubies. That means we got "1st" in practically all of our numbers. Which is odd since we didn't really do awesome but we did well. We did get some judge's choice awards though. That was cool.  The irony of irony was the Sportsmanship Award, which was given to a different dance school. (we got this award last year) A lot of our girls were saying, "that's not true" "they were such brats" *nasty glares*...so you're saying we didn't get the Sportsmanship Award. I would have to agree with that. Oh well, I pointed that out to them and I don't think they quite got the irony of their nasty glares.  On Sunday, I had piano competition. It went fine. The judge had a lot of sympathy for my limp (a knee injury at dance) it was cute. I hope I didn't get too much sympathy. i.e- win. I played all right but not as good as I would want. Oh well i got a shirt. yay!  The ride home sucked but oh well it's over now. i had re and we went to the villa. i met some cool people. they have a lot of hobbies. i would too if i were stuck there. they complained about how there was nothing to do on sundays. :(  after the villa, i went to the prom meeting. i guess Patwa has decided that me and Vivian are pretty much the decision makers. It was cool but odd because no one even knew we were making all these decisions. But now we have a grand march background, champagne glasses, and sheer. yay!   Around 9:30 I went to Roselyn's house and we worked on our presentation. I wanted to be done by 10pm...I obviously didn't make that deadline when I got home at 11:15. *sigh* I also wrote that crappiest english essay of all time yesterday. I was ashamed to call it mine. It's now handed in and there's nothing i can do about it. at least it's gone.  Oh p.s I got into Girls State. i guess miss alternate thought she was a shoe in for it. wah ha ha! now she can't rub it in my face...little snot. i think it will be fun. me and Babs will have a blast. sadly i'm going to miss my cousin's graduation reception. oh well.  Behold the power of...superficial pop icons, -Betso
