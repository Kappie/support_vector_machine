When we went to pick them up at quarter of five I was forced into the backseat so Dad could talk to his friend. (that was pretty much the way it was the whole time, completely ignored me to talk to John. I'm like then why did you fucking guilt me into going in the first place.) I read the label on my bottled water twenty times, and that was just during the homerun derby. During the game I had to take Satan Jr. to the bathroom twice because her father apparently assumed I was her caretaker for the evening. And the second time it was like ten minutes after I had gone by myself and ASKED HER "do you wanna come with?" stupid ass monkey. I felt really bad for the people sitting next to us they had to get up like ten times throughout the game, just because of us. After the game, that went into the 11th fucking inning, little miss my-parents-have-spoiled-me-so-much-I-actually-believe-I-am-the-queen-of-the-world had a craving for a cheese steak. Yes, that's right a cheese steak, at 11 effing  PM . So we sat in this grease palace near drexel university for an HOUR (because the demoness took so fricking long to eat her steak) while I watched three people scarf down charred animal flesh on a roll. AKA I spent an hour wanting to puke my guts out. (for those of you who don't know, which you should if you know anything about me, I am a vegetarian) Then we dropped them off, were home by one, and I slept until 7:30 this morning when my sister woke me up because she wanted to open her birthday presents.
