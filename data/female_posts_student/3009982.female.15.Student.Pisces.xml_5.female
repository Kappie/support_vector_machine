Dearest Dearest,  I'm listening to the Heart of Worship by Matt Redman now.  "WHen the music fades, all is stripped away and i simply come longing just to bring something thats of worth.."  Thats what we, or i, always sing, or sometimes even plead, perhaps?..when i sing it. BUt really, do i really simple come when the music fades?  DUring youth today, the keyboards, guitars and drums were wonderful. You know, it FELT so good just standing there, listening to the song, singing it and praising God. or so i think, or thought. Everybody around me was so in to it, you could see from their body language, the frown of concerntration on their faces ever so intense as they sang 'mould me, shape me, Lord.' I have to confess, yeah i was looking around, cos somehow i felt i had not been a really well-behaved child the past week and so there fore unworthy to sing mould me, shape me songs. mmhmm, i only sing and promise mould me shape me songs when i've been good. eh, i dunno la. Anyways, i observed the song leader, the OHP fella, friend next to me, the hands a few persons away and so on... the music was wonderful, trust me, the intense sincerity on ppls faces were encouraging indeed. but through out the whole thing i wondered, or probably more like doubted.. what really happens when the music fades.  if music wasnt there, would we, you know, FEEL God's presense with the goosebumps and dadada...  Gosh, i've been having this puzzling thing in my mind ever since goodness knows when... anyways what i'm getting at is, would everyone have that look of concentration on their faces if there wasnt any relaxing keyboards and background beats? i wondered this too at camp last yr.. the phew, traumatic experience, some what. you see, everytime the pastor had one of his session, he always insisted on having someone just sustaining some chords in the back ground.. ALWAYS, you know. and he'd then have everyone to close their eyes and focus on God while the pastor err, ministered. my dad says that it is possible that when a group of ppl get together, with a leader to lead them, eyes closed, with semi-dark lighting and background music, the leader can actually lead you into a trance.. not an occult or hypotizing thing, infact you're very aware of whatever is happening, jsut that you're erm concentrating on trying to imagine whatever the speaker is saying maybe? i dunno..  sigh, i dunno what i'm trying to get at anymore. my thoughts are scattered and i dunno which piece to pick up. goonditey.
