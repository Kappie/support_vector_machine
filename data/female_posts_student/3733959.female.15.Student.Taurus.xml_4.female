That and he put his arm around me but only when the same friends yelled at him to do it. i didnt know that he was a man-prude when he asked me out! someone could have told me...anyways now hes in vancouver for a month and i really want to break up with him because this whole "relationship-with-a-guy-who-doesnt-even-know-my-number" is driving me absolutely mad. now i hafta do it on msn. *growls* its not fair that is hould hafta do it that way but honestly i have no choice because i cannot wait any longer. i hope he'll be ok after. anyways its canada day *woot* and im gonna see fireworks! then tomorrow im going to go to edgefest! GAH!! i luv edgefest and my friend called me up a couple days ago and said she had an extra ticket! i freaked out and then realized my parents wouldnt let me go. my friends mom helped us with a plan -i luv her mom- and called my mom saying that herslef and her husband would be going with us. My mom is now letting me go thinking we will be with two adults. isnt that kik ass?! anyways i must go...i am craving blood...*unsheathes fangs* haaaa!! *gets cloak* I LUV CLOAKS!! hem... until next time MWAHAHAHAHA!!! *smirk*
