It was cool hanging out with someone new for a change. I came home around 6:00 today..Bill was upset because he missed me. But, trust me..i missed him a whole lot too. It was so weird not saying goodnight to my baby...and not calling him two minutes after I woke up in the morning. I still miss him right now. I want to be holding him. Anyhow..I dont feel like writing tonight, for once. So I'll give the update and some other news below before I part.  Christina said that Nibby looks better, so she is thinking about calling the lady in PA and telling her that she's going to keep him here. My sister wants me to take him, but she encourages me to get a bigger cage which I am going to talk my dad into. So I was quite excited to know that Christina wants me to take him. yay..  Kill Bill -Volume 2- wasn't as good as -Volume 1-. Actually, everything just changes within the movies. I'd score the first a 5 out of 5, and the second a 3½ out of 5    Blah...Nothing Left To Say.
