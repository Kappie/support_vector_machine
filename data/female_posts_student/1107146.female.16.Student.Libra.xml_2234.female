Two questions: 1) What do yall think about putting Becca on the blog?  She does seem to be a rather big part of our lives, and quite frankly it just might liven up the blog a little bit.  2)  What do you think about taking Abby off the blog?  She isn't exactly contributing anymore, and I don't know about yall (ok, probably nobody else but Josh) I don't like her being able to see everything that's going on while she's in this little anti-Lindsey mood that she's currently in.  I also wanted to note that the URL of the blog will be changing here in a few days as soon as I get some inspiration for the same reason.  Anyone have ideas?  Ok, just wondering.  Please post your opinion ASAP or it may just not get counted.
