(which they werent supposed to do..) and josh came over to help because jordan was in the shower but josh couldent do it.(the guys werent supposed to be over either...hahha) then later on jordan came and fixed it. jordan totally dominated at tony hawk pro skater 4. haha. no one could beat him. or even come close. but yeah...kelsey, cori, josh and i were sitting on the couch and kelsey was like "go over there and sit with erika on the chair." and that made me upset because they wanted the guys to sit with them and so i just got up and went in coris bedroom and watched t.v. for like an hour and they didnt come say anything to me until after the guys had left!!!! you mean, mean girls...but yeah. so we ended up sleeping in the livingroom. we were up talking for a long time before that though..      today my mom took cori, kelsey and i to the mall. (that never happens..wow) but yeah. it was okay. i got my 6th skirt for school now, a shirt from ae and some underwear. woo hoo. yep, yep, yep.      then we went back to coris and just hung out all day and stuff. it was fun.      then her mom took me back at like 7. and i dyed my hair dark brown. the more i look at it the more i like it. which it weird...because i dont think i really liked it at all when i first did it. but yeah. i hope i can get used to it.      now im here talking to jake, nathan and chris...
