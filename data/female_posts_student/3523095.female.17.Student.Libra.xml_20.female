I get this sinking feeling. Like I just lost something dear. I suppose I did…someone dear. A part of me. Nothing is permanent. Have realized that.  Let me get to business then… There was no A math yesterday….stayed in skool till 9. Went home late. Followed ash home. Saw gabe. I got a bit angry at something he said. And I sort of lashed out at him. Sorry for saying that gabe. It just got to my head. Please don’t do that again. truly sorry. Got a bad nagging from parents. Don’t use your authority on me. It doesn’t work. Tell me nicely. I am nice to pple who are nice. They said something that I didn’t do…I just don’t like that. if I get scolding for something that I didn’t do, I will just do it. And then accept that I made a mistake. Same thing goes for the hooking. When I don’t hook…don’t tell me i that did and keep harping on it. I will just do it. There and then. And I think it was embarrassing for the poor fella. That was what got to me. I know I am being a bitch. Cant help it. Cant be bothered either.  By the way, I am a DI. Same as cookie. Kewl ar? Yea…sister mah…  Went to town today. After begging so many people to come with me…I finally went today. Bought the bag I wanted. And it was a super fast trip to town. Was really nice of Jeg to come with me. Thanks ya. Hope the stuff you want to buy turns up somewhere.  Have ptc tmrw…don’t know how that is going to be…have lit. am going to miss 4 weeks of music classes in a row. I miss it. The light feeling after I play. Haven’t been able to touch my instrument. Haven’t been able to blog : (  I think I am making a mistake somewhere. Nono. I know I am making a mistake. It seems to make me happy…but makes me feel guilty also. I hope I am not crossing any limits here. Someone better tell me If I am.  Blabbered a lot today. Enough said.  Bubbye.
