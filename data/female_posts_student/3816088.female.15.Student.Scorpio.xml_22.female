I went to dance like usual with Mariah and we learned like the cutest dance to "Yeah" from Usher in hip hop (even though mariah and i can not remember how it goes anymore). And then Maegan met us up there and we went to jazz which was the same ol' same ol', just embarresing ourselves like crazy! Right after dance we walked over to the mall and met up with some other people to see Spiderman 2 (a REALLY good movie).      After that we all went to Maegans and spent the night and watched all of her old dance tapes...soooo cute!! but i had to wake up early because i went driving for the first time!!! sooo scary!      When I was driving I swear the guy was going to like take my head and throw it out the window!! I kept forgetting to signal when I made my lane changes and then one time I didnt break on a turn and OMG!! that was the FUNNEST thing ever but I dont think he agreed! but ohh well! I get to do it again tomorrow night and hopefully ill be better...really soon!! but in the mean time watch out for me because I am dangerous!      WATCH OUT!!             hEaThEr
