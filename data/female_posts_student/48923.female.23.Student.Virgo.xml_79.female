Damnit Ginkgo, where did you hide my library books?   --or--   Ginkooooh,why did you have to steal my left sandal?  I know you want me to stay home with you, but seriously I need to leave the house.   i blame him when i can't find my phone, housekeys, tax forms, homework, nalgene, clothing, cds, pens, as well as other things.  i do believe he has found a secret vortex to another world somewhere inside of my apartment.  this is his hideout for when he knows i want to torment him, and it is location of all of my lost things.  this hideout is connected to the hideouts of other house cats, who also hide their owner's things for tormenting purposes (btw, mary did you ever find those keys?) and conspire together for new ways of making their mindless owner do everything they want.
