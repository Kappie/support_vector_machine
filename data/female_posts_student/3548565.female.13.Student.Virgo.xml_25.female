Phew, teacher wasn't there yet. So I did my scales warming up n all those stuff, then lesson went on quite..er, not so well. My fingers jus wouldn't listen to what my brain was interpreting, so I ended up slipping here n there in my exam pieces. N that is so NOT gud esp. when my exam is only like...2 weeks away?! -_- Neways, I thot my bad luck wud end after piano class. But nooo...teacher made me stay extra 5 mins to copy down the notes. Fine..so I went downstairs to tell Mum cos she reached there at 9.15 tis morning. (Ouch, she must hav caught my horrible singing!!!!!!!!! ARHHHHHHH!!!!) Neways, I stubbed my toe so hard while walking up d stairs. God, it was so embarrassing. Luckily only my teacher was there, but my toe hurt quite a lot, til noon! =P Grrrrr! 
 So I went to sch, n I had to duty set up the PA system. But no one even did nethin b4 12.30!! Which was when the whistle was blown for the students to line up! So the whole process was a rush, but we pulled it off. Guess those grueling lessons Jason taught me paid off. =p It should neways, considerin wat he put me thru! Lolz. Then the whole schling time was like hell. Almost fell asleep in class. And Connie's 'friend' kept on stalking us like mad. I swear he's got nth better to do, poor guy. Then recess. I went to blok 3 to duty. There were ppl there..so I jus walked around then sat in the hall with Connie. OK, so recess was well...as usual. Boring. Then, class photo takin. Ai si!!!! Haiyoh, really no mood to take photo then la man! =p But wat to do. -_- Got that over n done with. N then almost fell asleep in Geo class again. Haiyahhhh!! How to keep awake?! So cold n i cud barely hear the teacher's voice! =P But surprisingly the boys were kinda quiet today. Maybe it was the rain. Haha... 
Well, turned out that I jus got a participation level in my Science New South Wales University exam. N well my cert wasn't given out during assembly. They only gave out the distinction and credits. That is like so......eeh! I told Mum they were SO SI AI BIN! N that IS so true. Soli lor..but it's true. I thot it was kinda unfair of them to do that, cos I know there r a few other ppl hu got participation too. Well, at least we tried. Don't we even get credit for that? THAT SUCKS! It pissed me off alright. OK, I think I've done enough ranting for tonite. 
 Well, at least there's no sch tomoro, cos the teachers r havin sum sorta lecture thingy...watever. Mum's goin. Bleh, so....I can't go out! I was planning to. But, yeh, watever. No mood to write liao la. Later maybe I will. K? Cya. Gnite, sweet dreams, bloggie. --Crystal@Piggie--
