It has that awesome B-movie quality to it, but at the same time they have some big stars like Drew Barrymore acting as well... it was... wow... I'm speechless!   It seems like the kind of movie you have to watch over and over to fully understand, and I completely intend to do so. It was just incredible; easy to see how it became a cult movie. When my b-day rolls around again (yes, a long time from now, but still!), the first person to buy me the DVD version (if it's out yet - we rented the video) gets a froot bat. I'm not sure what it is, except I found it in In Passing, and I like the word. :D   But back to my most amazing movie-watching experience last night: to all of you who like strange, crazy, hard-to-understand but just... wow... then I really recommend Donnie Darko. It is not a chick flick, or an action-packed thriller, but a real thinking / psycho movie that deserves a lot more than some quick-entertainment-seeking viewer.   Honestly, just... wow. Thank you so much B  R! I wouldn't say Donnie Darko is one of my favourite movies (it's just  too  far out for that...), but it was... wow... *wanders off in a daze*
