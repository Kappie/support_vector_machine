I got Joanne's and Kelly's and Kathryn's and MC's...amazingly fun good times. So, yeah...I really need to do my homework but I'm sort of complaining again. Except to Peter this time. He's gotten to be a really good friend. I guess some things have changed for the better over the last month. ..  Who knows?  Time to go wrap presents and do homework.
