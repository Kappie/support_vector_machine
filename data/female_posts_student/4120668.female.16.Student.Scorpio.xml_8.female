Kai pointed him out to me...okay so this is what he looks like...he was dark skinned (think he was malay), bald, had a long face, and most important of all features, he had a  v-shaped, pointy beard!!  i guess thats what really made him look like satan...haha...and the only thing he lacked was the long red pitch fork :P he didnt even need the two little horns sticking out of his head for him to look more like satan...MWAHAHA
