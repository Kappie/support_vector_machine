I'll be forever grateful to this and you. It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose it's only you.  Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel. Even new wine served in old skins will cheapen the taste. i shot the pilot begging you to fly this for me im here for you to use broken and bruised do you understand ?  it's only you, beautiful or i don't want anyone if i can choose, it's only you But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim. If I can choose, it's only you.  “We're wrecking” and I'm dry like a drum when you speak... so fine I'll leave... we're spent... take our time... measured... we slave for days and weeks.  It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose. It's only you. But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame. If I can choose... it's only you.
