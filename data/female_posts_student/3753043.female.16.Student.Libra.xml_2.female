Apparently some spam whores fucked up the forum so now all of the threads are passworded. I honesty cannot be bothered to type in a password everytime I enter a thread. No matter how much I like that forum. Maybe I'll leave it for now and then go back after a while and be all "I've returned!" and see if they actually remember me. Fla.. doubtful, though they all seemed to like my name "flamingramen". Heehee.  Damnit, don't you just hate it when friends change? Not necessarily into something that genuinely hurts or offends you. Just conforms to anothers expecations just to make life easier in some way. It's so hard to explain. I love and hate her so much right now. She was one of my bestfriends and now it's like she's dead because when I talk to her now she's not the same. She's not real and I can see right through it, which is what hurts even more.  I know who she really is but it pisses me off to see her supressing that just so fuckheads don't feel like fuckheads.  All of my girl-friends seem to be acting weird. Sometimes some of them hate me, and then others just plain don't understand me. It's like I just can't win with them sometimes.  I shouldn't let it bother me though.  I got a caduceus pendant today from Dreamweaver and a book on Indigo Children. I did that after I left Patty's. I actually cried in front of her . I've never done that before. We were just talking about depressing ex-friend crap and suddenly I was crying. I didn't even notice it was happening for a moment, even tho I was sobbing. It was strange.  But.. I'm gunna go do somemore nothing..  ..mmhmm..
