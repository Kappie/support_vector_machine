I'm also happy happy cause I have the 5th Fushigi Yuugi book! And some cool Ban Dai Sailor Moon thingies! (Ahh yes, love tacky Ban Dai!) I'm just SOOO happy! Uhoh, I'll go all depressed in a minute, oh nooo school and I haven't done any homework! I woke up in the middle of the night going 'must do home work, school tomorrow - ugh' so I started doing homework but then I figured that we don't have school today so I was like NOOO! And I couldn't get to sleep for ageees! It was stupid. When I woke up I felt like lead, and then I realised that I had started doing the maths any way so maybe it was better than it didn't have to be in by today! I even started making up excuses and planning to copy people! You know what they say - once devious, always devious *they also say: when you can't spell, you can't spell* Grr! Any way me go chop carrots bubi!
