January and Febuary were spent in...some form of interest in Ash. Being with him. Every. minute. of. the. day. It got quite dull. And finally in Febuary, it was over. I couldn't stand it, and there.   16th birthday was spent at the Cadet Valentine dance hanging out with my husband (long story) and a very attractive, nice guy. An ex was there, looknig stunningly hot, but I don't care.  March...Fundraising for Winnipeg. Most of the winter was doing that.  April was finalizing travel plans, and trying to get with the stunning creature I met at the dance. May was spent trying to continue this effort, before finally giving up. There were a few short re-consiliation efforts with Ash, only lasting a day or two. Boredom.  Then off to Winnipeg. Mind transforming. Seeing Alex. Erin. Sanford. Samaya. Laurel. Everyone. Planning, thinknig, marshmellow fights. Then 4 days at home, then off to Vancouver. Meetings, hair coloring, and Kelty.   June, paying for my two weekends in travel. Sick combination of strep/tonsilitis. Absolutely awful experience. Making up a month's worth of work in two days. Passing.  July....chilling with Josie and hanging around with the group. Water fights at Centennial. Then drying out.  August with Lannie. Making new friends with Tyler, James and Adam. Fooled around with James a bit. Biking with Tyler and hanging out with an awesome person. Adam.  September, new school year. Change in lifestyle. Medication. Lusting/Loving someone forbidden.  October, acting on lust drive. Fantastic. Life changed.  November. Conferences, meetings, and still chasing. Lost many a friend here...mood changes? Party..  December......no serious love interest still....communication, hanging out, partys, and...consoling.  This year was a huge change in me. And I've come to some decisions...and resolutions for the new years.. 1. Try to bring back some happiness to ex-friends and others, random goodness day 2. Stop chasing someone who is obvisously bad at choosing.....if he hasn't by now, he never will.  And I will leave you all with this...   ...We have familier experience of the order, the constancy, the perpetual renovation of the material worl which surrounds us. Frail and transitory as is every part of it, restless and migratry as are its elements, still it abides. It is bound together by a law of permanence, and though it is ever dying, it is ever coming to life again. Dissolution does but give birth to fresh modes of organization, and one death is the parent of a thousand lives. Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the watesr, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the days is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it has never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops - which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to despair. The Exorcist, William Peter Blatty.
