So you said to yourself, "I'll wait  for the next one." so you let the bus go and  waited for the second bus.   Then the second bus came, you looked at it and  you said, "eeee.........this bus so old...surely  very uncomfortable one." So you let the bus go  and decided to wait for the next bus.   After a while, another bus came. It's not  crowded and not old but you said, "eeee... no  air-con one...and the weather is so warm, better  wait for the next one." So again you let the bus  go and decided to wait for the next bus.   Then the sky started to get dark as it is  getting late.   You panicked and jump on to the next on coming  bus. It is not until much later that you found  out that you had boarded on to the wrong bus! So  you wasted your time and money waiting for what  you want!   Even if an aircon bus came, can you ensure that  the aircon bus won't break down or will the  aircon be too cold for you?   So people...(mostly girls but guys too!) want to  make sure that what you want is not wrong. But  it wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance,  right? If you found that the "bus" doesn't  suit, you just press the red button and get off  the bus!   But wait...I am sure all of you have this  experienced before. You saw a bus is coming (the  bus you want of course) you flagged it and the  driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you  and zoomed pass you!   The bottom line of being loved is like waiting  for a bus and whether you want to get on the bus  and give the bus a chance depends totally on you  and walking alone is just like being out of love.    Remember to always say what you mean.  If you love someone, tell. Don't be afraid to  express yourself.   Reach out and tell someone what they mean to  you. Because when you decide that it is the  right time, it might be too late.   Seize the day.   Never have regrets.   And most importantly, stay close to your friends  and family, for they have helped make you the  person that you are today.   The difference between doing all that you can or  having regrets which may stay with you forever.   Friendship is never an accident. It is always  the result of high intentions, sincere effort,  intelligent direction and skillful execution. It  represents the wise choice of many alternatives.   And remember.... Keep Smiling....coz... "Of All  Things You Wear, Your Smile Is As love returns  to me, As I return to you, As love returns to  us.   I guess this is really wondeful and make a lot  of sense.
