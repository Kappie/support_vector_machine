Anyways, yes so I also finished it today!! Ok so its not the longest book in the world, but she did die while she was writing it!! Yes so anyway, is absolutly brilliant, I have read other autobiographies, but I think is possible the best one!! I am not just saying that because I am a huge Marilyn fan, but it has hidden qualities. Not only was she a great actress, but she was also a fabulous writer, the words came alive on the page, it actually felt as though she was reading it to you herself, as if she where there in the room, speaking only to you!! I felt as though you got to know, not "Marilyn Monroe" but Norma Jean!!  .....yes so I will stop rambling now , as I have probably bored you all...........!!   "Its such a shame the world has lost someone so beauliful"  love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
