Last night I had to go over to Brookie's (4 years old) house to see her "Ch-ch-ch-chia" pet that she was making. The sweet little thing wouldn't let me leave until I promised her that I would take her out to lunch today. So now that the scene is set...here's the story:  I arrived back home from Tori's house at around 9:30. Two hours and counting until I had to pick Brookie up at her house for lunch. Finally got over to her house at around 11:45 to have an anxious little girl waiting for my arrival. She ran to the door, opened it and practically dragged me into the house so we could leave. Brookie's choice for lunch -- good ol' Mickey D's... and of course, like every little kid, she insisted on playing. So I spent a good 2 hours in McDonald's today. After that escapade we returned to my house. After many protests from the munchkin, I finally get to take her home. *end scene 1*  So now I'm home...resting...before I have to meet everyone at China Wok. I fell asleep on the couch. Smart me. I woke up at 4:35 and I had to be at the restaurant at 4:45 (no one ever credited me with being the brightest crayon in the box). And (just my luck) on the way there, I get stuck behind a truck going 25 mph in a 35 mph zone. I was too close to shooting myself. Dinner, once I got there, was a great experience. It was Ashley, Tori, Emily Em., Kerry, Cody, and I. I think it was even better because Emily was actually able to come. It's really nice to be able to see her again. So we are sitting around the table and good ol' Tori decides to call Paul for me (which is really funny because she just screams his name into her phone and it automatically dials it)...He actually wanted to do something! so the plan was that he would meet me at my house sometime after 7. ~later~ everyone has a great time and departs on good terms. *end scene 2*  I pull into my driveway and there's an extra car at my house. Relatives. *enter Brookie* Yes, they were at my house to watch the Titans game...but whenever MY family is together, the process is relatively the same: Torture Cassi. Tonight was 100% lighter on the adults behalf (too engrossed in the game)...but sweet little Brookie took an immediate liking to Paul. So when Paul and I went into the other room to watch a movie...we have a tag-a-long. Paul and I also make the mistake of kissing in her presence ("I was getting ready to leave the room because you guys were kissing!") "Psst...Cassi...are you in love with Paul?" (she's very intelligent...no one knows where she got it from) "Yes, Brooklyn, I am," I responded. "Good, 'cause Paul is in love with Cassi too." (he's such a sweetie) ~short while later~*enter Lori, Brookie's mom* "Psst...Mommy...Cassi is in love with Paul." "Really?? And is Paul in love with Cassi?"  "Yup!" So naturally, now my whole family knows how head over heels I am for this guy...and vice versa. "how sweet" you may say? You don't know my family. I will *never* live this one down.  'Night.
