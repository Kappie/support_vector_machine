Not only did I suffer the monumental insult of being woken BEFORE my alarm went off by my husband's snoring...not only am I having a TOTALLY wonky hair day on a day I have to get an ID picture made (naturally)...not ONLY did I have to perform the odious task of ironing this morning...BUT I BURNED MY FREAKING HAND ON THE FRIGGING STEAM FROM MY TEA KETTLE!  And it's a nasty red whelp now.  This was largely accomplished because I wasn't good and awake and couldn't see in the kitchen which was lit only by the early morning light.   Things have improved somewhat since I got to work (like the fact that I'm finished here at noon).   Went to Little Rock this past weekend to hear Evanescence, Seether, Breaking Benjamins and 3 Days Grace.  It was an awesome concert (though I don't care for 3 Days Grace).  Amy Lee is shaped like a good solid NORMAL girl.  Praise God.  A famous female of normal proportions rather than the prepubescent boys the fashion industry would have us believe is normal.  I couldn't believe that Evanescence called Little Rock home.  That a band like that came out of a place THAT conservative.   I can't wait for their next album to come out.  Damn that girl has a set of pipes.  The only real downsides to the concert was that we had floor seats, which meant no seats, which meant that everybody and their brother was TALLER THAN ME and Murphy kept having to lift me up so I could see my favorite songs.  I have requested seats on the sides in the terraced section so I can see over tall people for the next concert we go to (whenever that may be).  The other problem was all the jack ass smokers who brought in cigarettes and lit up despite the fact that it was a non smoking arena.  The weed was actually more prevalent than regular cigarettes.  I had a nasty headache after.  I managed NOT to fly into a berserker rage and start kicking and punching and yelling at them to "put out their goddamned offensive fucking cigarettes".  But it was a near thing.  Probably a good thing I'm not a large, lethally trained man like Murphy.   Trying without success to get enthused about the strawberry yogurt at my elbow.  I think I'd just rather not eat.   School starts on Wednesday and I'm looking forward to it.  Did a bit of shopping last week and have augmented my summer wardrobe (a necessary expedient since I haven't actually bought summer clothes other than a shirt here and there in the last 3 years because I loathe the fashions) with a few new pair of jeans and several shirts.   Been pondering a plot for one of my novels that's in the germinating phase.  There's a character whom I don't like who keeps popping up and I think I shall have to use him, despite the fact that I don't want to.  That happens sometimes in my work...a character pops up and ruins my nice neat organized plot, and I have to find a way to use it because they won't go away...like that annoying hanger on of the popular crowd (make no mistake, I was never either...I was the loner geek who never got invited to all the wild parties when I was younger...).   Guess that's all the news from the sticks.  Much to to today: register for classes, pick up books, student ID, parking decal, air up bike tires.  Same old hassles as undergrad.   Yours, Maggie
