Will work to reconcile with him while making sure not to fall into the trap of going back with him. Have spent most of my day listening to music. Took a break to wash my hair and put some creme on my scary bruise. Has gotten slightly more scary and purple since last checked.  Need to rent Bridget Jones' Diary as I started watching it yesterday because it was on TV but I fell asleep before it was over. And now I have adopted her irritating way of starting sentences with verbs and therefore never formulating a complete sentence. Yuck. Will henceforth try to stop. I can't change my profile because the link thingy just never showed up so that is puzzling. One more thing to confuse me. Oh well at the rate I'm going I will probably have forgotten within the next five minutes anyway. Lucky for me. Unlucky for me, I have no life. None at all. I did have a life. A rather nice one if I say so myself. But thanks to this little viral disease I have no contact with a lot of my friends other than email. Which sucks because they are all too busy to write me back. But I am all done with self pity. No more I say! Instead I will be a stronger individual. I will start tomorrow. Brilliant plan, self. Brilliant, indeed.
