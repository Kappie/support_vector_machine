Fresh dew upon the grass, Young birds chirp in their nests; I watch her gently sleep, My love to her I silently profess.  I enjoy the stillness and calm, Watching as she smiles and dreams; She brings me to stillness and peace, Like that of a slow flowing stream.  My heart and soul flow with love, And I smile as I quietly reflect; Iâ€™ve been handed a sweet princess, A sweet princess to love and to protect.  A vow to myself I make, As she quietly sleeps away; To love and always cherish her, Until my last breath... until my last day.
