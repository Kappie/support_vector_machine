Because Nathan Daniel Grebil made me miss it at 11 and my mom made me miss it at 8, so 12::30 is the next   episode! Well, on saturday I am going down to santa barbara on a plane, by myself!!! and since I'm 14, I'm not considered a minor anymore, so I have to get my ticket, get my bags on the plane, and get on the right flight, ALL BY MYSELF!!! I could end up   in Iceland!! uhhh, I'm getting nervous just thinking about it, but I'm excited to go see my aunt and uncle and go shoppping, going to the beach, and seeing my cousins and driving down to cal poly! But, still, in order to get there, I have to pass the ride of   my life, an airplane ride by myself! I'm not scared of airplanes, it's just the fact that I'm going by myself, I mean ,I'm from ukiah, I'm sheltered! Well, if anyone out there has any advice, I would really like to hear it. Have a great week, and I hope to see you when i get back, if I make it there and back in one piece!
