Turns out everyone else was too, so I didn’t get pranked. My party anyway. Well, not completely. Emily and me’s birthdays are like a week apart so we always just have this big one at her house (check that, actual house, not apartment. Rare for Houston, but Emily’s filthy rich. I mean, this is River Oaks. I feel afraid to touch the carpet, really.) and this year was no different. She gave me a diary - you! I don’t know, nor do I really care, what Orion actually looks like, because that’s what I’m naming you anway. It’s because you’re black and velvety and very soft, with little fake crystals on you spread about in random order, but at your bottom right corner the little crystals spell out the word “Diary.” You are a diary, my diary, but you’re also Orion, because I want to call you that, and because I will. Tomorrow, I swear, I’ll go to Hobby Lobby and buy some of those little fake crystals and form the word “Orion” in your velvet sky out of diamond stars. And you know what? There’s nothing you can do about it.  I’m Virginia Elanor Kirby, but you must call me Ginny or you shall die. Nice to meet you too.  Breakfast is served, it seems. More like brunch, but whatever - it’s nourishment.  12:40 pm  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Just showered. Happiness is warm water, shampoo, and coconut conditioner.  Mum says hi. Accosted me about my presents. Says I must make a list so I can send thank-you notes. Sure. Can do.  Emily - Orion; light-up pen (v. cool); Barnes and Noble gift certificate ($30! Score!); black t-shirt that says “6 x 9 = 42” (I’ll explain later); and a gel-pen pack Yvonne - $25 g.c. to Hastings (Score again) and 2 Happy Bunny stickers (‘your anger makes me happy’ and ‘cute but kind of strange’ - so me) Clair - very cute p.j.s ; blue slippers with floofy yellow star; and black nail polish. Wench (Becky Sue; but call her that and she becomes dragon-like) - Evanescence cd (they are too cool) and two pairs of socks (I love socks) Katy - black cloak from Ren. fest (awesome beyond belief) Vanessa - $25 g.c. to Barnes and Noble and a beautiful black rock that has rainbows in it under the light  There. Done already. Now have to write notes. Bleh.
