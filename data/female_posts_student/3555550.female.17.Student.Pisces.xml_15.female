I already know I want to major in secondary vocal music education and vocal performance and minor in theatrical arts. I want a school with an AWESOME choir, good teachers, small classes, and a stellar music program. So naturally the first school I thought of was: St. Olaf. Well, now I'm not sure. I mean, their choir IS stellar. I about died when I heard them... and it takes a lot for me to be impressed. I almost always have something critical to say. But then I heard Concordia College's choir (in Moorhead) and they were awesome as well. What the bloody hell am I going to do? What if I get to college and I hate it? I seriously refuse to transfer... start all over again. Or, what if I don't go to St. Olaf and I end up hating the choir at the school I do go to!? Or I love St. Olaf's choir, but their theatre department starts sucking? Can I actually find a school with everything that I need? And what if I get a boyfriend? What if he wants to go to school in Texas? What if I think I love him? WHAT IF I DON'T GET THE SCHOLARSHIPS I NEED!??!?!?!?!?!  I      am      freaking      out.
