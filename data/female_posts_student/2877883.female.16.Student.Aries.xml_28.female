Downloading and listening to "shared" John Mayer songs such as "Lifelines", "Area Codes", "Break Away", and most interestingly, Mr. Mayer's lovely rendition of "Pop" by *NSYNC, which leads nicely into a lovely version of Room For Squares.  It's actually hugely funny, you might wish to sneak a listen from al those lovely sharing obsessed people who live in that little place we like to call iMesh world.  2. Reading some random people's Ujournals, but the funny thing is that I probably only talk to these people about once a month, because I don't really know them at all.  But I do know what they were doing on Monday, March 1, 2004 at 7:54 P.M.  I could bring it to court if I must.    Now preparing to procrastinate some more by looking up some festive French party games/food/ideas online.  Lovely.
