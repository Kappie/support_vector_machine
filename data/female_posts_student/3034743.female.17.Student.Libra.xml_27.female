I don't actually know how that helps me, but oh well. Today was a boring day. It was just your typical Monday. Mondays are always mundane. Ok, I must be tired or something because I found that to be really funny. I need to get out more, I swear. Today it was really funny. I was walking with Erin in the hall, and I saw Matt. Me and Matt both gave each other a weird look/smile and then we looked away. Erin noticed that and began laughing, and she was like 'what the heck was that?' Ok, yeah not that funny as I retell it. Oh well. If something interesting happened today, I would talk about it, but since nothing did, I think I'll be done blogging for now.
