As any other elementary school girl would, I did book reports on Eleanor Roosevelt. Marvelous woman. FDR is credited with many a marvelous thing too. And to think that he was also guilty of infidelity.  It's really a stupid fear right now, but I've always disliked that acidic tang to infidelity. Maybe it's just because it's coming from a starry-eyed, hopeless romantic raised in a culture where family and, in this situation, monogamy, are cornerstones. Mental imagery suggests FDR as a noble man. But he cheated on his wife, and she found out. Discussed divorce. Now what?  Perhaps Lucy Mercer was exactly what FDR needed in his bout of polio, in his WWII anxiety. Perhaps Lucy Mercer fulfilled all of the emotional requirements of love, of female companionship, where Eleanor never could. I can't really pass any judgment on Mercer except right now, without any background, I have a feeling she is horrid. Everyone commends Eleanor for her activism, for her involvement in public affairs. For the longest time, I just associated that with the role of a good wife.  new light.
