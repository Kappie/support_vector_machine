FINALLY decided to go to Rush .. then she got irritated at me for nothing .. cause she thought i was irritated .. when all i said was that i wanted a non alchohol drink when she ordered vodka .. argh .. laura got into deep shit today i guess .. i think her mum must be pissed at me or something too .. she kan toi-d .. big time .. she passed the phone to edmund and he blurred there .. suddenly blurting out that his * krystal's father .. she stayed over that night .. she was pretty nice the whole time .. suddenly out of nowhere i mood swinged and got emo about the whole jee may thingy again .. it felt good to have her there la .. she comforted me the whole time about it ..
