I'll try and post one a day so that at the end of the week i have a collection of 5 . tell me what you think :)  Reflection on a Gift of Matricide  My brother came to visit me again he’s almost a man he cries because he knows I’m doing this for him I’ll try to get 6 sliced off for good behavior I’m in for a 20 year bid  …………………………….I know he’s trying not to thank me  He’s doing good in school now Success is now his responsibility Now that I’m not around He can be the man of the family  …………………………….I know he’s trying not to thank me  He tells me Dad is dating now I tell him I’m happy He says dad can’t say my name Without feeling guilty  ……………………………I know he’s trying not to thank me  Dr. Milford said These fantasies Were normal Were healthy He wasn’t there to testify When they became a reality ……………………………He won’t be thanking me for the liability  I really should try it With all the shit wrong wit her anyone would buy it
