HOME SWEET HOME  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine ahead has caught my eye And roped me in so mesmerizing It's so hypnotizing I am captivated I am   Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so Isolated so Motivated I am Certain now that I am  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  So turn up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment for forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim Against the current  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself  My hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption [dashboard confessional]  so later days!
