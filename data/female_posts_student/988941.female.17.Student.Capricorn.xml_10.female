Basically I'm awful and am gonna fail all my GCSEs is what the teachers said, and that I'm a rebel, trboule-maker, etc etc, the usual. But other than that, a VERY amusing chat with old Mr Westlife (his bame has been changed due to the fact he has called me Josephine twice this week), and then I couldn't stop laughing when I finally sat down to talk to Mrs HIcks, a) cos I knew what my mother was gonna say, b) it was quite funny seeing my mum smiling at Mrs Hicks in her 'Yeah, I'm smiling and acting pleasant but I think you are an absolute twat' way that she does, and c) my mum had said to me before hand that I could tell all my friends that she's sorry but she tried, and she couldn;'t get her hands all the way rouind Mrs Hick's neck!!! I just could hardly control myself, and Mrs HIcks probably wondered why I couldn't stop smiling at her! Anyway, hwo did eveyerone else go? Oh, and I  have found the route of my head pains- I need to stop grinding my teeth, cos it sends pains up my jaw, adn that is where it ius coming from! SO solution found! toodles peeps.
