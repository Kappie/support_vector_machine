It was a very slow match, neither of us really exerting ourselves and just playing quite..leisurely, I guess. It was getting rather hot, anyway, which makes the best of people just kind of slow down and forget scores.    But then, I had to play the #1 seed.    Which..didn't really bother me. I've seen her in a lot of matches. And the last time we were at this tournament, she got out in the first round, then in the consolation round, too. I knew she'd outpower me, but I figured I'd at least try and give her a run.    And I did. I did quite well, actually. My serve was going insane, but that's because my coach had told me the day before that I'd been doing it all wrong and I hadn't remembered I had a tourney, so..I didn't really practice fixing it. Oops. I managed, though. The score of the first set, 6-2, doesn't say how we went to deuce every single time.    Anyway. It was easily around 80-85 degrees outside and it was just getting..really hot, to play tennis. We had to play on a clay court that hadn't been watered in a while, so dust was rising everywhere, especially after long points when we both had to run down the ball. Ooh I did really good, though, because a lot of the time she'd hit a very good angle but I would go diving after it, and she'd be caught off balance because she figured I wouldn't get it and..yeah. Anyway. I was running a lot.    So during the beginning of the second set, she was up 2-1 and I was..just..losing it. Mentally. Well, I hadn't realized it yet, but there was one point where I just dropped my racquet after hitting a great serve and stared at it thinking "Oh hey, I dropped my racquet. That's pretty funny." and I hadn't really processed that yet when she hit it back...If I had been an onlooker, I would've laughed at myself so much. I just stood there kind of stupefied.    That's when my Mom yelled at me to get off the court and sit in the shade for a while but I yelled back No and that she wasn't even supposed to be saying anything. My opponent was pretty confused, not sure whether to laugh and keep a straight face. I don't remember much of the tennis after that. I just knew I was pretty dizzy, I was kind of talking to myself, and playing..bizarre-ish-ly.    Half of the time when I was serving, I had to toss the ball straight up towards the sun and I couldn't see. So then I had those little traces on my eyes..y'know..and I kept trying to blink so I could see. Which..didn't help much. And at that point, we were going to a 5th or 6th deuce on nearly every friggin' game so I was just desperately trying to get it over with. Which..oh man, it was awful. I would just toss the ball up and hope I hit it, and I was hitting some great serves. So I'd, say, get the first point, but then she'd hit a winner when it was add-in for me. And then I'd double fault, but then when it was add-out for me, she'd hit the return straight in the net. 'Twas horrible.    Aaanyway. Afterwards my Mom got mad at me and said I was having some sort of..heat stroke thing..which I wasn't listening, of course. I just had to lie down because I felt like I was gonna be sick. oy.    Somehow in the second set, I got another game, even though I was going crazy. lmao. I started laughing during some points. And then at the ends of others, when I hit a bad shot or something, I'd just start making up words and just..rant on stupid stuff undermy breath. I don't think the person I was playing against heard me, sooo..um..that's good.    Ok I'm gonna go do stuff now. Maybe go crazy again. I dunno.
