John Edwards will be chosen as Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates respectively. Thus the reason for the convention is not really choosing who will run, but confirming who will run; more importantly though it is a wonderful media blitz. It provides a arena where for 4 days the Democrats can present their platform and candidate to the American people and the media. When they do this the entire media focuses on the Democratic party, and places less emphasis on the Republican side of issues. This is the perfect Public Relations situation for the Democratic party. In fact, as the Gallup Poll organization notes    Historical precedent suggests Kerry is likely to come out of his convention with a positive "bounce" of perhaps as much as five to seven percentage points in the projected vote."     This shows that Public relations blitz of this type are a perfect way to increase a candidates possibility with likely voters.
