I tHinK we look good in ties. makes us all look so much smarter. but the school giam la. dun wanna provide ties for everyone.. It's used only on special occasions like Councillors Investiture or when some students enter competitions and represent the school.. Bleahz! i dun like the idea of it. i still feel if possible, all Kent Ridgeans should be given a Tie at least. but looking at the juniors now. Wah.. i've got nothing to say. I doubt they'll ever look smart in Ties... their mage in our eyes are Tarnished. I'm disappointed man....   urlLink
