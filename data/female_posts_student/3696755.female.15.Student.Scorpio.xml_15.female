In the car last night Trey asked me, what i was ganna do when i was older. And i told him about what i wanted to do, about how i wanted to go to college and study peoples minds. I love all that stuff, like how ur mind works, it fasinates me. Anyway so we talk about all that for a while and have this real meaningfull conversation about our lives. Trey and i really understand eachother, like where were coming from. Were a lot alike. Later at my house, we were talking about this girl and he was telling me how she needed to find her self. and how he told her that "u no i really dont no who i am eighter but latley ive been sitting down with my self nad finding out what i want and who i am and just sorting threw my stuff." and after he said that i was like wow, i really need to do that. I need, just about more than anything right now, to find out who i am. casue i think thats a big part of my problem. I think thats a big part of why things arnt the way that i want them. Its the reasion that guys dont like me, bc im complex and how can someone try and get to know u and like u if u dont know and like your self...? He was telling me that right now hes living his dads dream, hes playing baseball, doin the good grade thing, ganna go to UT and play baseball and become a arcetect. and he just looked me in the face and said i need to find out if i really want to do that or if i want to go do what i want to do, go be a doctor, not go to UT, quit baseball, or am i ganna just live threw my father? And then i realized that i dont no what im living, im just kinda floating around, im real..confussed isnt the right word i guess but im a lot of differnt people right now, in a lot of different ways. Like half of me wants to be this laid back, i dont care, free sprit, but then the other half wants to be this preppy, fun, good grade, little girl. and so far ive tried to do both but its odd. I wish i had my licence, id drive up to ruidoso, and just be alone for a couple days, think. I need time to be out of my house and just think for a while, a long while, get my stuff together and straighted out. Im glad Trey and i had that conversation, casue for the first time i was around someone who was thinkin ahead. i mean all my friends think ahead but not like that. they think of tomorrow and like next year at the very most, but this was a bigger picture. This was now, and forever. and it was good for me to be with someone who, for the most part, has there stuff together and no realizes that hey, what i dont have together i need to get together casue thats important. Life is more than, who your goin out with right now, who your hangin out with, what your doing tonight, its who YOU are. Its not about aynone else its about you, your life is about you. and i think till now ive been rapped up too much in all that other crap that in 2-3 years wont mean shit to us anymore. I wont no 90% of these people then, i wont care who there with, but there will be some i will still no and i will ALWAYS have to no and care about myself. so i really really need to get this started an just find somewhere that i can just sit and think. Find out who i am, casue the sooner i find out who i am, then everyone else will too and i think that will help a lot...
