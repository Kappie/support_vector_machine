It's from No Use For A Name's "This Is A Rebel Song". Great song. Umm, here are the lyrics...I think you'll get it.   I love you my hard englishman Your rage is like a fist in my womb Can't you forgive what you think I've done And love me, I'm your woman  And I desire you my hard englishman And there is no more natural thing So why should I not get loving Don't be cold englishman  how come you never said you love me in all the time you've known me how come you never say you're sorry  i do  Oh please talk to me englishman What good will shutting me out get done  Meanwhile crazies are killing our sons  Oh listen, englishman  I've honored you hard englishman Now I am calling your heart to my own Oh let glorious love be done Be truthful englishman  how come you never said you love me in all the time you've known me how come you never say you're sorry  i do i do   So there you go. Finally.  Anyways I'm really tired, so I'm thinking a nap is quite called for.  Have a lovely day, crazies.
