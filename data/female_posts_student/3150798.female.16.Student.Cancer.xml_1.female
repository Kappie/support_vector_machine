As usual, my eyes immediatly gravitated towards the "Dining room" slot, and I was astonished to discover an abscence of my name in that box. My first thoughts were that I had never been scheduled for that day and my being there was a complete result of my own stupidity and inability to correctly check a schedule, but before I turned to leave, I happened to notice I was down for Register Five. I was immediately overtaken with gratitude, thinking some kind and caring manager had taken pity on me and wanted to give me a break from dining room, and those thoughts seemed confirmed when a manager double-checked to make sure I was okay with having a less-familiar duty. I said yes, and he told me he would help me better re-familiarize myself with the register after I clocked in.  So, I sat down and sipped my iced tea, waiting for my clock-in time to come. I noticed another manager approaching me, roster in hand, and I felt even nicer, assuming she wanted to also make sure I was comfortable with my task. "How nice," I thought. "Maybe these people care about me after all".  "Bekah, I just wanted to let you know that we accidentally wrote your name down for register. You're going to be on dining room today, okay?" What she meant to say: "Bekah, some manager went temporarily insane and thought he would make you responsible for handling money and talking to customers and getting people's orders straight and running a cash register, and, (laughs) we  all  know that would be a huge disaster since you are a complete idiot and you never get anything right and the only reason you are still working here is beacuse we can't find a solid reason to fire you that would pass with the operator, but we are working on that. So you need to stay out in the dining toom and out of our way so we won't have to think about you and maybe we can forget you exist,  OK ?"  Okay, so maybe that was a  little  exaggarated. But still, it was rather dissapointing-especially since I have been with them for almost a year now, and I don't feel that they trust me to do anything but clean up after people. Our operator has reassured me that they just happen to like having me on dining room, but if that was so, how come I never get more than two shifts a week? My job has been a bit frustrating and monotonous lately, and it's hard to imagine myself working there for over three more years-until I graduate. I don't know if I'll make it. It's not looking very hopeful now. But atleast, if you happen to stop by Chick-fil-a on a Saturday, you'll know  exactly  where to find me.
