I will change them reguarly, I love phrases and words that have a deep meaning in it... I have also added the Weatherpixie. She is a Japanese girl wearing a kimono. Don't know why they name her a Geisha. A Geisha is an art and I think they should be respected instead of being insulted.... Kawaii!!! I really like the dolls, so cute and darling....
