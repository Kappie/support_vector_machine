There was a period of time when I thought, ok, I'm in control of things. But I'm not in the driver's seat right now.  It's not really troubling me, but I just know things change and the only thing I have to make sure to do is to see that I am still fundamentally me. Have I just put personality on hold in order to better pore through the study material without getting distracted? Is that healthy?  I'm sure in other times this would simply be classified as a moment of feminine weakness--in a general sense, thank you. Scarlett's aunt would just swoon and grab the smelling salts. What will I hold on to?
