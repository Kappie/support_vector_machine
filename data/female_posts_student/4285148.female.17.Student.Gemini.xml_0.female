Nervous as all hell, I sang horribly but somehow managed to do a decent cold reading.  The couple who runs the program are wonderful.  Terrence and Stefanie are supportive of student actors and un-altered by the cold realities of life in the theatre business.  They offered me the part of Victoria, a small part and ensemble singer.  I don't think Terrence realizes how happy I was to be given the opportunity.  At the academy I get a lot of really good training.  I work hard with other talented kids but its not the same as actually getting the chance to go onstage and perform.  The experience is necessary and This can be a great opportunity.
