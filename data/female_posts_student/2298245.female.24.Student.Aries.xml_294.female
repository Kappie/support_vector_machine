       
      Well, I've got some drugs in me, and have had for quite some time, so I'm feeling a little more functional, if not better.  The left side of my nose kept me awake last night, it kept getting all stopped up again and again, no matter how many drugs I used to combat it.  I didn't get as much sleep as I would have liked, but today, I have things to get done, so here I sit, at my computer, toiling away.  Perhaps I'll even feel up to posting outside the context of my icky sickness later on today.
