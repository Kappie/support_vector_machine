Hope i get the lyrics right... part of "superhero" by Stephen Lynch ...if i could be a superhero would you be justice guy make sure people get what they deserve, especially women who lie like a wife who leaves her husband with three kids and no job  to run off to f-ing hawaii with some doctor named bob i'd skin them and let them bleed till they die especially bob because i would be justice guy you could be subtle, no i didn't mean to be vague give her the mad cow disease let him die of the plague and then they'd pay for their terrible lie especially bob and then you would be a super hero, like me  god what a guy, he is just hillarious.
