I woke up at 2pm...sleeping for 10 hours straight. Fucking rights man! That never happens unless its the summer...and I didn't do that at all during last summer considering I had to be up ear-ly (Drunken Sailor reference) in the morning. I slept and wow...it was really worth it. It was worth the sleep. However I am a donk. I put on Fast Times at Ridgemont High, thinking that I would watch it but then again...was I really thinking. It was three in the morning by the time I had this highly brillant idea.   Sachin once told me that I can't sing. I'm tending to agree with this statement. "Hey...ya....hey...ya....hey...ya. Oh you think you gotta it. But otta don't get it ... Separates always better when feelings are involved." I love Outkast. Fucking brillant. I've been swearing a little too much as of lately. Whatever..."I'm just being honest"....Now fellows...whats cooler than being cool? fellows---> ICE COLD! Lend me some sugar I am your neighbour...."  Hey because of that reference about shaking it like a "polaroid picture" Polariod issued a statement saying that "shaking it like a...." does not help develop the picture faster and it causes damage. You've got to wonder about the media. Are there not better things we could report on? How about the fact that lets see...how about concentrating about how biased we report wars, disasters or anything of importance. What was that? American Bias. How about American Spin to quote the cookie nazi!  Have I ever told you about the cookie nazi? Well its your lucky day.    The Story of the Cookie Nazi  One day...a couple months ago I attended a conference for  uncovering the real axis of evil  which apparently to the U of W is free trade. Fair trade=good...free trade=bad 'cause it means I can't get my granola at a cheaper price. Kay, so the conference in the morning concentrated on the U of W's perspectives towards trade and how big business is bad for us. Then the afternoon consisted of us all splitting into workshops and learning more... Low and behold...we went to the media workshop...Media Hahah. (thats the actual fucking title of it, the cookie nazi thought it would be funny to call it that). SO we went and attended...we had to sit in front of tape recorders and conduct interviews with each other. Aaron and I went together. We came up with a program called "Eyes on Your Iraqie" It was funny. Ola and Deedem however...crawled into a crawlspace and almost everyone pissed their pants laughing at them. EXCEPT THE COOKIE NAZI!  So we did our interviews and then were told to go for lunch down in the multi-purpose room.   We went down and had some kinda food...I think it was tacos. Not completely sure cause it tasted like shit. But whatever...we had food and we noticed there was cookies. To make up for the other shit we had been fed, we took cookies and instead of putting them on our own plates, we put them on a communial plate and put them in the middle of the table.   Prof who was teaching the Media Hahah course wandered down and yelled at us. "Why do you have soo many cookies? Are you ungrateful? Why aren't you back in the classroom? Whats wrong with you?" She then took our entire plate of cookies and dumped them back in the box. She then made us go back to her sucky Media class. She was a pro-womans feminist...with a large nose. Scary enough. As soon as she left and went back to her room...after giving us a STRICT warning to follow we yelled...proclaiming her the Cookie Nazi.   Thus the cookie nazi was born. When I went to another conference a couple weeks ago...she was there. This time she was the one eating all the cookies. How typical. THAT FUCKING COOKIE NAZI! Gave her the finger and went back to eating our pizza. Take that....whos going to the university of manitoba and never has to worry about her again!   Anyways that was an amusing story...and my neck really hurts. I think I may just curl up with my puppy and just nap. Then eat some popcorn.   Can someone answer me this please....if I told Ben that I was interested in him...how would that go over? or anything? Can someone just help me out!   Ah walnuts to that nucking futs!   Call me if you'd like to borrow me.
