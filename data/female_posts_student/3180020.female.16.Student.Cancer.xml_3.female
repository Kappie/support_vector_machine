Me and Jessi got up at around 10 to call *you*, but you were already gone.  We came downstairs and ate some cereal.  The best drink that's legal for me right now is probably the milk from after eating frosted flakes! ITS SO YUMMY! lol  I took a shower and got ready for pictures.  They sucked b/c we didn't match, and mom worked so hard to get us to.  I was supposed to spend the night with Jessi, but she chose to do something with Dusty instead.  I love how quickly things change. :(  I haven't talked to anyone today and Im feeling a little left out.  oh well.  I took a nap outside today and read a lot in the book Friday Night Lights.  Its really good! I love it because its about high school football (which is one of my passions) Im kinda tired and bored so Ill talk to yall later! Luvs yo!
