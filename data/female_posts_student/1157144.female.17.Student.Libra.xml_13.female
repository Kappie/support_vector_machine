Just when something good start to happen, something else goes to hell. It's quite frustrating. Anyway, I want to do something on friday night as well, but i believe i have been screwed over by damn pep band. Oh well, maybe i can meet up with you guys when the game is over.   Well, I hope everyone is having a dandy week.  p.s.- i think i'm suffering from chronic boredness
