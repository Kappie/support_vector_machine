Then when the storm stopped Amanda came over and we made pizza rolls and ate them!  EVERY time Lori comes over there is pizza rolls invovled because I am in love with them and they are all that I eat!  Then we walked to Karina's house because my mom wouldn't drive us to Lori's house to hang out!  Ummm, Karina wouldn't answer her door so we walked around the house to her bedroom window and and started throwing small rocks at it!  (( Just like when the guys come over and throw woodchips at my window ))  She finally answered and let us into her house!  She was decorating her walls with pictures of all of her friends!  She has two pictures of me and one of them is so horrible because its when I had braces and my hair was blonde and I look yucky!  The other is of me and Lori and Lori looks so beautiful and I look yucky because I'm an ugly person!  Then we came back to my house and we just layed on my bed and talked for a bit and then my mom brought Lori home and it made me sad because I really wanted Lori to sleepover with me and Amanda!  But that's ok!   Then me and Amanda watched House of 1000 Corpses and it is so freaky!  Actually, I thought it was going to be a lot scarier!  It was really funny at times!  I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because Amanda was sleeping and I didn't want to wake her up! Then I went to bed, the end!
