My mom even made this great dinner tonight too and I was really looking forward to it and I hardly ate a bite. I hate that. Oh well. I guess it's a good thing I'm babysitting later though. I can put the kids to bed by 8/8:30'ish and just read or watch TV until their parents come home. Good times. Well, I guess I'm off to take a shower before I go. Ta ta.
