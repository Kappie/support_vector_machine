I forget that when I go through periods of sleeplessness, this often helps, because I usually bend my wrists into the dreaded position when I sleep, causing tingling and discomfort bordering on pain.  Driving to CO aggravated it again.  Last night I dutifully put on my right brace (usually gives me more trouble than the left), and woke up in the middle of the night with my hand right hand all a-tingle.  I had removed the brace during sleep, and put it in my closet and shut my closet door.  I didn't know it was in my closet until this morning when I went to get dressed.  This concerns me.  I'm not a sleepwalker, and I'm a light sleeper.  Does someone need to confess to breaking in, taking off my brace and hiding it in the closet without disturbing me or Ernie?  Or am I just becoming somnambulent?
