Here's what I had planned around this time 10 years ago:  -  I was going to UC Davis and graduate there after of course rooming with my best   friend Keiko...Obviously that didn't pan out...I ended up at UC Santa Cruz...And Keiko and I never ended living together...But she slept in the same bed with Ed and I on our wedding day, does that count?  (LMAO  Long story, that is what happens when you marry at 19 and everyone and their momma sleeps in your room...Was funny though)  -  I was going to be a BIO major.  LMAO  Yeah right, I should have added being the future President on that list...I might have had more chances with being a President than a BIO Major...I am Education major now.  -  I was going to travel before settling down.  My ass hasn't even been to Hawaii yet.  -  I would have a big wedding and magical honeymoon.  (Well big wedding came five years later and no honeymoon yet...But we have forever, right?)...oh and I also told myself I w*wouldn't get married until I was done with college...So I was aiming for 23, 24...So I jumped the gun a bit.  -  I would have 3 kids by the time I was 30...(okay I think this is the only thing I accomplished...I had 3 kids by 25...haha  five years ahead on that one.)  All in all I figure my life is just as it should be.  I can't do anything to make it any better.  I am so blessed to have this family and to know this amount of love at such a young age.  I can only hope and pray it lasts forever.  Okay, enough procrastinating.  I have some cleaning to do.
