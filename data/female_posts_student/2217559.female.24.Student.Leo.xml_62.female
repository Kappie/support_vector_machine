No more blue blazer that's 2 sizes to big and no more make-up twice a day.  I will put on my white t-shirt, jeans and flip flops and walk off of this floating city.  Grab a beer in the San Fran airport, say goodbye to my friend Kim who will be heading back to Holland, my friend Dwayne who'll be returning to the UK- and then bam!  I will be home. Arriving shortly in the airport to the beautiful smile of my mother.  I can't wait.   I filled out my resignation form today (they make you do thias every contract). I dropped it by our crew pursers office and smiled. 4 weeks to go. only 5 days left in this cruise and then I ma off to Alaska.    I will miss many people here - like Helen from Scotland, Adam from Colorado/Utah, Tineke from New Zealand, my cabin attendant - Terrance from India, Nils from Germany, Kim from Holland, Bisser from - wait I don't know where he's from??? I hope to see them again some day........ BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HOME DAMN IT!!!!!  I can't wait to kiss everyone's faces and show all my photos and talk for hours about the lessons I have learned. The lessons you have learned, yaddi yadda yadi.  I can't wait to see Lisa Letchworth, Paddy Langford, AJ!!! It feels like an enternity since I was free. ree to take off my watch and not worry about the next cocktail party I must attend, or the next formal night when I have to put on a party gown again.  Oh, I can't wait. Mom has planned a nice toobing trip for me and Jenn and family for July 4th! We will rent a cabin and stay the weekend! That will be very nice.   So we finish this week with our final --- final --- final trpis to Mexico.  Tomorrow we will be in Mazatlan, Saturday in Puerto Vallarta and Sunday in Cabo.  2 Sea Days and then back in San Fran - then 1 day until I am in Vancouver!! Yippee!  I am so excited to see another part of the West Coast! And then Alaska as well. Don't worry I will tak eplenty of photos!  Alright, I have the Captain's Cocktail Party now so I must head there (we call it Captain's _ _ _ _ - I will leave those blank for now...hehehe). See everyone very very very soon!  30 days and counting!  Love, Shellaki.
