He acted as if he wanted to grab her hand or put his arm behind her back but if he tried he would jerk back before she noticed. He ordered.         “I want a 16 oz. Mocha coffee and mmm....what would you like?”                   The girl smiled sweetly                                                                                                                              “Oh ya know I kinda don’t drink coffee...Im sorry.”        “ Oh well I... should have......made sure do you wanna go somewhere else? I mean it would be no problem or well they have other stuff like...mmm.....................well Ice cream, or mmm like food food   some at least or a Java shake , well without the Java cause coffee is java   and yeah??? UMM your choice.”          “Umm..... Shake chocolate”she said. And they left.   Erica and I were cracking up. Cheep date.  	Another guy walks in and orders.          “Coffee two sugars, and one cream.”          He looks around as he waits he looks around for somewhere to sit. Someone he knew. He finds noone, and leaves when he gets his order.  Again we laugh. Bluntness.   The third was an old woman. Not very old but she had wrinkles.          “I would like the IRISH CREAM Favored Latte. You see I am for Ireland and It just makes me fill so at home when I have something from home.”  Big grins spread wide across our face.            The next was a young girl. Not young young. About say 15.          “I want well I don’t know. Ummm Maybe a Java shake or well how is the Mango ice tea? wait I don’t like mango. Umm lemon I love lemons how is the lemon ice tea? Oh but wait I hate tea.............ill have ............................................................................... ...................... .................. ..........................................................a............................................................................................................................................................................................java shake. Vanilla.”  I was about to bust. She left and I did and then Erica followed.  Second to last. A teacher. She has papers pilled up to her nose and was peeking over the top of them.          “I want Cappuccino.” her words muffled by her voice. “Umm cant you bring it to me....my money its in tha.....well on the top..yeah get it.  Thanks.”  We cringed when she almost dropped the papers sitting them down.  It was 8:30 and about time to go. Erica pulled out a dollar fifty and handed it to me. I went and ordered a Chocolate Shake. Three dollars even every time. I pay the rest and we leave and don’t ever finish it.
