Being at my boyfriend's house, one has a clear view of Manhattan. But this morning, it was obscured by all that smog. I finally saw him off to work (ok so he went reluctantly but I assure you I did not have anything to do with his reluctance!) and got down to the serious business of chatting online with my mother.  After yesterday's cooking disaster, I have decided that I am going to make a meal of which one can be proud and lo and behold, here comes another obstruction. If it says beans and Sauce in a can, why doesn't it simply have beans and sauce? The variety that I have at home is supposed to be beans and sauce and instead it has a bunch of other stuff like ham sauce and oregano and what not.. looks like I need a new lunch menu. Of late I notice most of my conversations seem to revolve around the kitchen area. Cooking, cleaning, and other housewifely chores. Could I be turning into one of those horribly boring woman who can talk about nothing but that? I know several woman like my mom and so on who are housewife but by any standards cannot be termed boring. I just hope I turn out like the latter and not like the former who are horribly tedious to be around.  Sometimes I wish I could just give this all up and go back home. To my safe little cushion where I have no responsibilities and so on. Then I remember that irritated me too. So I guess I better just see what the future has in store for me... for now that also includes what to do about dinner.
