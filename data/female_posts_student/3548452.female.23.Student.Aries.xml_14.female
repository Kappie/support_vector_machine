Some feel like they are totally wonderful cheaters and that they just cannot be caught... well, this one is for you. I dont know what it is about me that makes guys feel like they just need to try to put me down or make me think I'm inferior to other women just because I'm overweight, but you need to really get over yourselves. That Alicia Keys song, "A Woman's Worth" says it all I seriously think. I dont know what makes you think that I'm a pushover, but I'm not. I've been around for a while and I know what's goin on. More than that, I'm well loved... I cannot find an ex that will sit in my face and call me a b***h or anything else derogatory so, what makes you think I'm going to take it from you. For the first time in 10 years I am single now- completely single, and I just dont think you guys understand what that means for you:: I dont put up with no stuff. I dont have to. I do feel kinda empty sometimes because I'm by myself now, but that doesn't mean I feel desperate enough to wanna be with you just because you are nice to me or wanna ask me to sleep with you right away. Case in point: Raphael- this is for you. A guy pm'ed me and right away I told him (like I tell everybody else) that I am not looking for sex on the internet nor a man, so whatever he was looking for he wasnt gonna find it with me. Within a week, he wanted to "marry me" and he felt that if we slept together that we should be together. That's all cool, but then when it became an issue of us sleeping together right away- that became a problem. Fool, I dont know you, I dont know where you've been, what you've been doing- or even if you're lying to me about who you are, hence the reason for me saying I'M NOT LOOKIN FOR ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET. And if I ever doubted that guys lie on the internet- Don, Paul, whoever the hell you are- this one is for you. I met this guy online and he seemed pretty cool, but me being busy all the time- I dont call people... I'd prefer them to call me so I'm not making an ass of myself calling them if they dont want me to or if they're busy. Well this guy does tattoos and he seemed like a decent guy... until he actually did start calling me. Okay this guy is big just like me, but he's a guy. I'm a girl... guys stalk girls just on sheer boredom. Women aren't that tricky unless you happen to meet some crazies, but still... it's not a reason to 1-give somebody a fake name, 2-try to ask for a piece of ass while telling a woman that you dont need a piece of ass from her (and if you say you didnt ask for a piece of ass, I dont know anybody else that would rent a hotel room just to go smoke ya idiot) 'cause you can get it elsewhere. And then the mother of all mistakes- you WORK in the same city I live in so it's safe to say since I've been here 23 years now that I am bound to know somebody you know. The degrees of separation for me are about 2 in Flint, versus the whole 6 that you're supposed to have for the whole world. I know somebody who knows you, dummy so if you live here, dont try to lie to me. Then hangin out with a friend who happens to have worked with this Paul/Don person, I find out not only are THOSE names not his name, he is apparently married. If I doubted that it was him that this person knew, they described him, told me what tattoo place he worked at and everything. Not cool, old man, not cool. As for Rafy- when I made it clear that I wouldnt sleep with him, he called me a b***h and accused my BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD of saying the same and that I was crazy and that's why I'd never have a man. Anybody who knows me knows better- including my exes, so to spit out a blatant lie like that is just plain stupid on your part buddy. And you men wonder why I'm so evil all the time and I dont wanna talk to you... I've heard every line there possibly is and when you try to come at me with one I'm over here laughin my head off 'cause you dont realize I'm smarter than you think I am. There are some really nice guys out there but it seems like they dont ever wanna bother with me until they get screwed over by somebody else then they wanna screw me over too... how nice is that? Sometimes I wonder if people have any sense. I'm gonna get a shirt made that says "Common F**king Sense, Use it :|" But until then, this blog will suffice :D
