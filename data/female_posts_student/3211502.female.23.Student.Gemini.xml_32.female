Now all that lies ahead is moving in (slowly) and setting up what will be our home for the next three years.  We've already moved some stuff in. We hit up Bed Bath and Beyond and Filene's Basement and bought some stuff for our bathroom, kitchen, and living room. We can actually eat, cook, use our bathroom, and watch TV in our apartment now.   I'm starting to slowly move all of my crap over to the apartment. I didn't realize that I had so much stuff. Garth is coming on Monday to help me move. I really am that pathetic. I'm the type of girl that needs her boyfriend to come help her move. Though, I am going to try to move as much little stuff as I can. Garth can help me move the big, heavy stuff.  I'll post pictures as soon as I am all moved in and I have furniture. Furniture, for the most part, will have to wait until my mother comes to NYC. There are plans to go to Ikea to get the major pieces of furniture - desk, dresser, bookshelves, etc.   But, yay, I live in the real world now. I'm like almost a grown up!
