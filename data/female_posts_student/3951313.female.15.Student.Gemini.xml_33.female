That's how I feel  when I cut  Like there's nothing there  Like I can't feel anything  and all the outside world  fades away   But people's natural instinct  tells them something's wrong  that I shouldn't be acting like this  so they talk to adults  tell them their worries and cares  and I get called in to "talk"  I know what they want me to say  that I need help, that they'll find help   But I just block them out  and tell myself that everything's going to be fine  They tell me to talk to people  To open up  But I just keep them out  I go home and sit here writing   Numb.  Such a small word  yet such a huge feeling...
