It's always there at the end of those long exclamation mark repetitions... It's evil....EVIL. I shall beat you one. Mwahahahahahahahahahahaha. .  Anywayy....seriously, going to Joanne's was the best. It rocked. Hm, then.....I had marching, and I got reallllly burned. More burned than I did the entire band camp, and we were only out there for three hours. Ah well. The show was good tonight for where we are. I think we'll be really good this year. I hope so at least. But now, I am tired, and...very very hot. Sunburns make me feel like I have a fever, and...hmm....not hungry because I just ate but because I am sleepy, I shall retire to MY nice comfoy cozy bed. Not those silly bunks.  No marching until Wednesday again!!!!!!!!!!! :)
