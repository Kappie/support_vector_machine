I just keep telling myself: Only 2 more days and then I can eat all the cheese and watch all the tv I want! :)  I was finally able to get in touch with the lady about the Court Liason job in Southeast Pennsylvania today...very exciting...No real news to report yet, but let's put it this way: I had to consult a former professor about the ethical dilemma of bailing on my practicum students for summer.  Hopefully next week I'll know something definite either way. Until then, I'm content to look for apartments in Reading, PA.  3 Hours from D.C., 3 hours from NYC...joy.  Much better than 14 or 20 hours.  Still trying to sell the green chairs and the rugs if anyone is interested.  Someone please buy them.  They're comfy and dogs love to sit on them.  More to come.  For now I'm going to take another nap...I'm exhausting from eating a huge dinner to make up for the nourishment I lacked all day.
