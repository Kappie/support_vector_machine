"A local band was playing cover songs on the stage, and it wasn't too long before Brad's mother got up to sing with them. Brad couldn't leave well enough alone, and got up to sing, too. "My only regret," he said, laughing uproariously, "is that I don't enough of the words to the songs!" The band kicked into a Guns and Roses song and Brad stumbled along: 'Take me down to the Paradise City where the la la la and the girls are pretty. Oh won't you please la la la....' While on stage, Brad filled the bowl of the Cup with champagne, then spun, spraying the nectar of champions into the crowd. "Who's the best singer, me or Marty St. Louis," Brad asked. "Brad, stick to playing hockey," came the reply, to which everyone howled in laughter."  -- From the Stanley Cup Journals  A absolutely adore this man!!! Brad you rock my world!!!! You Brad it's all you, you are the best singer :P            Brad with lobster in the Stanley Cup! Too awesome! Go check out the whole article  urlLink here
