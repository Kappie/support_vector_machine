He says he wants to be with me, he says he wants to hug me, he says he wants to kiss me, he says he wants to talk to me, he says he wants to love me. But he also doesn't want to love me yet because of school and whatever. Love isn't optional. He can't just love me later on when it's convenient for him. Why did he say he loved me earlier if he really he doesn't know? Didn't he realise I would be upset later? He says he likes being with me, he says he always thinks about me. I take those as signs of being in love.... but if you want to be with someone and you think about them a lot does it mean you are in love? I don't think it's fair to say people will know when they are in love, I think that often people don't know... It seems really unfair that I love Chris and he doesn't love me.... and he got my hopes up and everything. :( I don't know how to feel. He still cares about me, he's still going to really miss me when I'm gone.... but I thought he loved me and he doesn't. I wish somebody could explain love to him. I guess my best explaination is when you think about the other person all the time, you always want to be around the other person, they become the person who means the most to you in the whole world... also other people interest you less. Plenty of people have crushes on loads of people, but I think a sign of being in love with a person is when your feelings for other people become weaker, and your feelings for the one you love become stronger (although I guess this isn't always the case...). You're in love when a simple kiss can make you feel happy, but if they aren't interested you become miserable. When you're in love the other person's happiness is more important than your own, and you would do just about anything to stop them being sad. Also if you can see yourself having a future with the person and being happy, that's another sign. Anyone who reads this, please comment on how you think being in love feels like. Maybe Chris does love me and just doesn't realise... he did say he doesn't know what love is, so how could he know if he loves me or not? If you think he does love me, feel free to try to convince him. I just have one very important rule. NEVER LET HIM FIND OUT ABOUT THIS BLOG.  Bye for now!
