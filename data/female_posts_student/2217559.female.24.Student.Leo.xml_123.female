I love presidential years-  a time of change and broken promises to begin. Ok, that sounded jaded and pessimistic  - forgive me. Go vote.   Happy Saturday - I am at home being bored as heck today. Just did some laundry and still in my pjs (after 12:30pm). Anyway, maybe I will go shopping or go see a movie. So much alone time. Hmm, can it be a good thing?!?!  Love, Shell
