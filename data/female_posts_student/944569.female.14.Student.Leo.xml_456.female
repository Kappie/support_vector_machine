Yet good is mostly referred to as a pure white snow.  I have always believed that it is always hard to be evil.  Yet, i began to realize a few things.  Firstly, I would prefer the dark rather than light.  I'm more of a dark person.  Very reserved and not many people know me very well.  They only know my one "universal" quality, meekness.  My friends asked me why i would prefer the darkness.  I will now explain.  We live in a painful world.  No one knows the truth for certain.  It is hard to say but our world isn't very beautiful.  This probably explains why half of the Earth will always be darkness, from the beginning of time to the end of eternity.  In the light, you see all of the truth but that does not mean that it's pretty.  Most truths in this world are harsh and real.  They are solid blocks.  But, in the darkness, you don't have to see the pain.  You don't see everything.  You don't know everything.  Only a small parcel of knowledge.  To know everything, to be in the light, would be horror for me.  Knowing all truths and lies in this world would drive me insane.  Even outside, in the sunlight, my eyes always seem to not be able to accept what they see.  It always seems that whenever they are in the light, they are forever searching for shelter, in the darkness.
