Actually, I am trying a new way to write my entry. You can't always stick to the same hi-today-is-a-boring-day stuff.... -_- But of course, today was a little bit boring with some waste-the-time subjects and I think I will go into hiding.... Coz my friends knew my blog. Yeah, maybe to others it will be cool or popular. But to me, it is a diaster!!! Stupid me. Today I signed in one of my junior's autograph book and I  PROUDLY  -_- wrote my blog's address. UUURRRGGHHH!!!!!! I am as good as a roast duck (very juicy, nice to eat, yum, yum) Anyway, juz came home, I went with my mother and aunty to the Jade Crystal Xiao Long Bao Restaurant (name ssoo lloonnngg) to eat my favourite xiao long bao.... The restaurant is quite small but cosy. And we tried the la mien, I tried the suzchen style with hot hot soup! But it was not that hot or spicy at all. Except it was a little oily with all the peanut oil.... The xiao long bao was excellent, the soup inside the bao was little (all dripped away :p) but sweet. And the drunken chicken was a cold dish but full of wine smell, DELICIOUS!!! But the price ah, haiz.... So expensive, $41 for three persons including GST and +++...... But I always remember this trip as I really love xiao long bao!!¡¡¿¿??
