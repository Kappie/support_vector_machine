Kayla will definitely be there... dont know about everyone else, tho. Imma call them after I get off the internet and remind them about it. So yeah, food, swimming, shaving cream fight... we're gonna have fun. Yesterday me and Amber went to the mall and got pictures made. If I knew what I was doing I would put them on here... but I dont. So oh well. We got to spend time together. So that was good. Then we took her home and I came home and called Blake. We talk for an hour and a half. He is so sweet. I'm really glad that we are together. I'm finally over Drew.. so that is a good thing. I want to be friends with him, but im not going to push it. He'll come around... eventually. Thats all for now.
