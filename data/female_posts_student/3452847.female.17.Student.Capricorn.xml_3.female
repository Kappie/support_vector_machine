Damn him, and damn him for being wanted, and i know hes been with other girls and i know he won't tell me, but i still feel like there is something there, the way he looks at me, and holds my gaze, and we laugh together, its just me, being silly and wanting more than i can get, why does he have to go meet Mandy? Or why does he have to like other people, all i want is sex... He may have had sex in the past 7 months but i haven't and its doing me in.   ~Lisa~
