Was going to park myself in the Peace Gardens and read my book (Alex Harvey's biography at the moment) for a bit, but it was full of half naked kids screaming in the fountains.  So that plan went out the window. I just had a wander instead, it was quite nice really, haven't done it for ages.  I go to London on Wednesday, I'm sort of looking forward to it, I guess.  Josh's party is on the Friday, I don't really want to go, I hardly know anyone who's going.  I'll see what happens, maybe I'll come down with some illness so I can skip it.  Hmm  I wish I was going to Leeds festival, for more reasons than just the bands.  Oh well, next year.  It's my brothers 21st pretty soon, he's so hard to buy for, I'll think of something.   I'm just rambling now, this is very disjointed, I apologise..  I'm trying my best to keep myself occupied so I don't smoke, and to take my mind off other things.  It's damn hard.  I just realised, today was the only time I've been in town and haven't gone in Freshmans, thats strange.  What was I thinking? Obviously I wasn't...  Anyway, I'm all out of garbage for now, might write something later.
