You do something to me that I can't explain.    So would I be out of line if I said, I miss you.(?)    I see your picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine.    You have only been gone ten days, but already I'm wastin away.    I know I'll see you again whether far or soon.    But I need you to know that I care and I miss you.
