I'm thinking a random mutt from the  urlLink  Anti-Cruelty Society  will be best.  They offer staff help in making a selection, there's an application process and adoption counseling, and my $55 fee covers (among other things) a vet exam, inoculations, some tests, fixing, and a microchip.  So, I'm also thinking about who to will the dog to should something happen to me.  Don't worry!  I'm not planning anything, just want to be prepared.  Any potential takers?
