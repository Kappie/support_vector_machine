We were pretty bored, but we had a good time. hehe, he got really sick, swollen eyes, sore throat, head ache, and he fell asleep in my bed, aw how cute! His friend wanted me to make out with him, but since I'm totally drooling over my man, I turned him down. I think my man realizes that I want him, we talked once he got home  It was pretty reassuring, I think we're going to do stuff together whenever he comes over on like Thursday or Friday night. I don't sound to stoked about this whole thing, but I am, I'm talking to Anna on the phone. She seriously has been a saviour to me, last night I heard about all these terrible thingsAndy said, and I almost cried. Anna's been there for me though, she's helped so much. She made me realize that Andy is a stupid piece of shit, and that fucker doesn't determine my happiness. I think I'm starting electric guitar soon, Anna, Tara,  I are starting a band. It's going to be amazing. We're pretty serious about the whole thing, we just need a little bit of motivation. I'm going to show Andy "Didueatmygenitals" what he's missing. Haha, that's what my babe called him. How special. Anyhow, I'm out for now. YAY! My Boi was in my bed.
