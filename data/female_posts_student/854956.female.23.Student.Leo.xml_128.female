But alas, last night I fell asleep while watching Roseanne on Nickelodeon (around 10:15pm).  I'm pretty sure my Mom came in and turned off the tv and my light, because I know that I didn't.  I was OUT, and I didn't wake up til 5:30ish this morning so that I could allow myself enough time to shower and all.  I had to make sure I would have time to dry my hair.  It's COLD outside again!  :-)  I really love winter... it's my favorite season.  Okay... so without further adieu...  Weekend Update...  I went to Austin on Friday night to go see Sinus with Ricky, Melissa, Wolf, Ruthie and her boyfriend.  I had never met Ruthie before (but had heard about her via Melissa) and I must say from the moments that I got to talk to her, I really enjoyed her personality.  The show was awesome!  The guys made fun of The Lost Boys, and man... what a show they did.  I especially enjoyed the skit in which they made fun of Cory Haim in the bathtub.  :-)  And the fact that John shamelessly made fun of the saxophone playing guy wearing purple spandex pants made me incredibly happy because I've always thought that his character was very random in that movie.  Anyhow, after Sinus we met up with Richa and one of her friends for a while.  We went to a coffee shop that was incredibly smokey... which surprised me because I thought that wasn't allowed in Austin restaurants and such anymore.  Hmmm... weird.  Anyhow, I was really tired (because I'm not used to staying up that late)... and well, when we got backt to the apt. Ricky, Wolf, and Melissa wanted to watch 24... so they went to Melissa's and watched it while I took a shower and went on to sleep.  The next day we all went to Kerbey Lane ON Kerbey Lane, and the service was surprisingly better at that establishment.  After we ate and went back to the apartment, I gathered my stuff and headed on home.  I had to tend to the animals, and they were VERY happy that I did.  :-)  The rest of Saturday was spent doing a lot of nothing.  It was a schlump day.  Sunday I looked at the ads and saw that coat I bought was on sale, so I went to Target to get a refund of the difference... then I got stuff for my costume.  :-D  All that I have to do now is sew the skirt and I'll be set for Friday night!!!   Not much else is going on.  Thankfully I don't really have any tests this week.  Just my ASL test today and a presentation on Thursday... but that's it.  Okay.... and so now I shall go... with the extra time I can get some breakfast and a cup of coffee.  :-)  I'll post something tomorrow...
