Bonus Prize: Megs grad tonight... and its her 18th.. again Happy Birthday Meggies!!... so woohoo for partying to keep my mind busy and unoccupied..  I miraculously DID survive the weekend... without Mark and I killing each other... (quite the opposite.....)... and without putting myself back down the hole of depression that so favors me..  Sooo what came of the whole experience?  I'm still trying to figure it out....  but I'm glad he was there...
