Erin: (thinking he just said "did you hear my song") Oh, yeah. Blake: What? Erin: Wait, what did you say? Blake: Did you hear my sour note? Erin: Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.  Blake: I really wish I could have hit that sour note better. Little kid who plays Mr. Snow's son: Oh I heard your song! Which of the sour notes was it?
