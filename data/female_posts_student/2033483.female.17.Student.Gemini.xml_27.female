I still see the marks from my swimsuit but still you can't tell I ever had a tan and I am now returning to pale flaky skin which I've named "Winter Skin."  I hate winter!    School was schoolish today.  Well, duh!  New seating arrangements in both AP Lit and Comp and Chemistry.  Why must teachers change things up on me.  I would welcome the change in Algebra but I was fine in the other classes.  Mr. Powers was real testy today!  What else is new?    After school, Renae and I ran to the flower shop so she could buy some flowers for Ashley Blake's B-Day on Friday, to Best Buy, and Wal-Mart.  I love going to Best Buy.  Even tho I rarely have money with me to buy something I just like to look...That and Barnes and Nobles.  Yeah, I know, I'm a geek!    History notes are dumb.  I was watching Dashboard Confessional on TV when my grandma called tonight.  I love Dashboard, they are just so...Wonderful.  But she called in the middle of the show...grrr!  I guess my Aunt Lynda moved into town without telling anyone.  Huh.  Then my mom called my Uncle Todd to inform him of this.  They started talking about Thanksgiving and Christmas when my Uncle said he didn't know if their was going to be a Person Christmas this year b/c they were going to be gone for band and my Uncle Terry is going to be in Colorado.  GRRR!  We always have Person Christmas...like since the beginning of time!  If we don't have Christmas together this year because of fucking band I will be pissed!      You know how some people are dreaming of a white Christmas?  Well, right now I'm dreaming of a tropical vacation spot because I think I need a vacation!  Thinking of the warmer climates....
