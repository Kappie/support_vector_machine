I guess I can understand crayons, pencils, glue,  etc. I refuse to supply them with film, ziploc bags, and clorox wipes. I think that they are taking the supply list too far. What do you think? I did however purchase Kleenex and dry erase markers. I questioned the dry erase markers but at least I know she can blow her nose.      millions...
