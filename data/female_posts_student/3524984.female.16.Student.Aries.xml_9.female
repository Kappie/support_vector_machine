I can't always be "there". Right?  He has called me over six times. Always asking me if I can go out with him. I always say no. BEcause, I am not "into" him that way. I've told him SO many times...but he keeps going at me...:( He is now mad at Billy, he says its all Billys fault that I am not "into" him that way! Huh? He doesn't know apparently...Eep.   Went to the brige today. Seen where those two people were killed. So sad. There are flowers everywhere around the water...poor dude will be missed, Big Time. He died with his mom. Poor soul. How hard can it get?  I'm really tired. Tired of school mostly. Exams and all. >.  Ok, currently...I'm in love with "Misfits" Oh yeah! Love em! TIGHT...I listen to them like 24/7...Aww...moi et la musique...ins√©parable...;)  I cut my, my own hair. :| Erm like 6 inches off by myself. Heh, mom wasn't to happy. Meh. The hair is ok though, I think. I cut it right before grad. Hehehe...Fuck the hair. the dress the shoes. Every FUCKING DETAIL must DIE or BURN TO FUCKIN' HELL! Ack. That makes me feel a whole lot better...  I love this song...    HIM - Gone With The Sin    I love your skin, oh so white I love your touch cold as ice and I love every single tear you cry I just love the way you're losing your life  Oh, my baby how beautiful you are oh, my darling completely torn apart You're gone with the sin my baby and beautiful you are so, gone with the sin  I adore the despare in your eyes I worship your lips once red as wine and I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine I just love the way you're running out of life  I'll post more tomorrow...right now I feel sick...ewW...RIP Jenn..~On t'aime toute!
