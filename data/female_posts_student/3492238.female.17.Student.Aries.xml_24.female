Maybe it likes me.. hahaha. No? Okay.  It's like I work my butt off to make a play and there's no one there to back me up. 4th. I guess we deserve it as a team, NO PRACTICES!! Hmmm. I wonder why we can't work as a team... fuck. I just want it to be done so I can be with people my own age. So frustrating. I'm seriously trying not to lose it. I didn't get to pitch tonight either, they put CS back in, even though she walked 5 the fist and second innings she pitched. That doesn't make sense to me. I mean, if I'm not pitching fine. But put SS back in then. She was fine tonight. I hate grade 9s! agggghhhh. Stupid ankles. Stop swelling up!
