And we were saying how bizarre would it be if we did actually say how we really were, what would be people’s reactions?  Then I told him about what I had read in Mike Yaconelli’s book Messy Spirituality (thanks SO much Mel for recommending this – its SO amazing) where he talks about pretending being efficient, uncomplicated and quick. Answering fine to the question, ‘how are you?’ is far easier.  Honesty requires a huge amount of time and effort.  Mike says that pretending is the grease of modern non-relationships, the oil that allows us to perpetuate the illusion of relationships.  Pretending allows us to have relationships without actually having them. So James and I agreed that every time someone said ‘how are you?’ we would give them a real (well real-ish answer) So I used an adapted version of Mike’s example “well actually my back is aching, my friends are all not talking to me (partly true you see), I don’t like my body and actually I’m not sure that there is even such a thing as God.” Reactions were interesting and ranged from ‘yeah right’ to ‘oh I’m so sorry you’ve had such a bad day’ problem was I wasn’t very successful at keeping a straight face whilst doing it – so not too convincing.  But think we made people think and it was a bit of a laugh!!  Other than that day has been pretty normal. Went to my talk together group to look after 10 children under 3 (in fact 8 of them are under 18months!) whilst their mummies did Bible study and then helped my flatmate with her presentation, then went to a all-christian-groups-except-the-christian-union prayer meeting.  James and I were then going to work in the chaplaincy but ended up putting the worlds to rights instead.  Felt ok actually till about 10pm then it hit me and I sunk down again.  Lets hope the submarine surfaces tomorrow hey. Tomorrow is Thursday – which is battle day with the CPN – ugh.  See you soon. (I wonder how many people are actually reading this bizarre but apparently true tale of my woeful life???)
