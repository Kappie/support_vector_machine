If there is one person you can't stop thinking about, post this same exact sentence in your journal.   Okay now the reason I'm pissed is because, I just REALLY, REALLY started getting into Brand New, like past song #5, which I hadn't done when I first got it, and holy shit I was missing out, I just wrote them off as dreary and slow, but they are brilliant. They make all my other cd's seem like meaningless ramble. I'm in love with their writing, I can honestly say the cd changed me, opened my eyes. And to think that when "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" came out I hated him. So I'm becoming ubsesed with them, to the point that they are all that I listen to, and I bring it to Dacia's house so she can burn it and listen to it (not that she's worthy of this) and I accedently leave it there. That was a week ago, and when I ask her to bring it back to me she says, " Uhh it's not here, are you sure you didn't take it?" I remember leaving it in her sisters cd player. And now it's missing! I could cry, I love that cd so much!!! And now it's gone. I guess she could just burn me another one but, I want my original. I guess I should of made sure I grabbed it but, now she lost it. This sucks! I gotta do some make-up work and then I'm gonna watch "The Real World" I think I'm gonna cut my hair like Robin's... mabey not as short though...
