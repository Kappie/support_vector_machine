I also get to meet a few of her friends which will be cool. I am looking forward to meeting new people and I know that I will fit right in with the group. These last few weeks I have discovered that I have a lot more in common with Melissa then I thought I did. I am very fortunate to have been able to build upon this friendship because I need to be able to be with people my own age and she is close enough to me where if I need her she is there.  In other news, because of the lack of signed Budget for the State of California, my hours have been reduced down to 20 hours a week. This has really placed a damper on my time with Jesse online (I usually would talk to him while we are both at work, just to pass the time a little quicker). Today he has been very busy with things to do, which I am glad because he isn’t bored and it gives him something productive to do with his time. To tell you how important Jesse is to me, I am complaining about how my time to talk with him has been shortened but I am not worried at the fact that my pay has been reduced due to the cut hours.   Other than that things are going ok. I finished the July Newsletter for the FRG, and I am very pleased at how it turned out and have been searching for things to put in the next issue. Still no word on whether Jesse will get to come home on leave or not, but like many things with the Military, you always know at the last minute. Take for instance when we found out that Jesse’s Unit was being mobilized, we knew all but 2 days in advanced and even then it was just an alert. They didn’t even confirm it until 2 days later when he showed up for his drill weekend and then his weekend turned into 2 weeks then 3 ½ weeks out of state and 3 months with his mobilization station to 12 months boot to ground in the middle east. Who would have thought that the Military was so good at utilizing the element of surprise?
