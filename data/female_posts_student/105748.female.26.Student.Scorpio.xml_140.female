From Monday through Friday, Filipino programming comes on around early evening 5ish PM, one show that is on is called TV PATROL. My tagalog is very poor, but from what I gather it's a sensationalistic Filipino news program. It has things like miracles seen near a statue of the Virgin Mary or a feature on circumcision on young boys or some gossip on actors. But on occassion it also has news clips on government and one time I saw them show the Mayon Volcano eruption.  I don't like watching that channel because I cannot understand most of it. No one in my family is a good translator. If anyone has seen TV PATROL, correct me if I'm wrong cuz when I see/hear news from the Philippines I'm not really sure what is true and what is tabloid anymore.
