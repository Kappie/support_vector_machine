Danny and I had an actual conversation, but I think I was too drunk to understand how much of an idiot he actually is. He can be okay sometimes. My brother came up and slapped Danny on his shoulder and said, "I thought I told you no, Danny." I laughed and walked off, no, stumbled off. Speaking of stumbling drunks, Nick was just about as wasted as I.   I want to write so much about last night but then again, I just don't. Not because I'm shy about the whole thing but I just don't want it to come across the wrong way. Ah, what the hell? In my opinion, I've already screwed things up, so what do I have to lose.  I tried almost too hard to keep my mind (and hands) off of him. Yeah, didn't work in the slightest. The whole Michelle and Paul thing sort of weirded me out, but that was only when I was sent to save her from statutory rape. I got this whole over-protective, mother-like image in my head and I was trying to just do something to save her from regret. I don't know if she regrets it, but she told me about how she thought it was a desperate move on her part. She spent the night in his room.  And as for me. I had no plan. Michelle and Paul had a plan for me... but sometimes I don't know. Yes I do. I know that it hurts me more that it helps, and I just try to stay away from that. I don't know why I'm crying about it. Paul told me he'd pay me if I broke Nick and Julie up. Fuck that. I'm not a fricken fate sealer. Sure, I'm in the same boat as Michelle is with Ned... desperately in love. And Ned is just like Nick in the sense that they both think that the friendship will still go smoothly even if love is in the picture. But I screwed up big time. This morning when the drunken, outgoing, stupid side of me showed up I was almost able to put that personality back into the box it came from. It made me think way to hard about what I'm doing and where I'm going in life, and if I'm just going to be some slut or party-crazy girl for the rest of my life. And driving back with the 80s Mix in put this feeling of complete white across my face. My mind was just completely blank. Not really because I didn't want to think, I just didn't know  what to  think. For everything that has happened over the past two months... I sometimes wonder where all of this is taking me. I'm sort of scared.  I'm sorry Nick.
