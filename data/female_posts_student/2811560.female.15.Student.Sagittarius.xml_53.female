And we're in the weight room, so I'll go in the hall and do "situps". Lol. But we get to end early to go clean out our lockers. Fun. Ugh, I swear, in every class we're doing study guide, upon study guide, upon study guide! Its crazy. Half the time I just sit there and write notes. Yeah in algebra, my teacher gave us this little mini quiz thing for the written final, and I got 3 out of 4 right, so yay for me. But after he gave us the answer to one problem, hes like "Ok, raise your hand if you didn't get this right". And so a bunch of kids raised their hands, and then he goes "Three fourths of you will fail the final". O...k...thats good news. Yeah, me and AJ did our Spanish oral today and actually we didn't do so bad. We had to pick out a random picture and just talk about it. I think we got 100, so thats good. I'm not even going to study for Spanish....seriously, I did the entire study guide in like 2 minutes without even using the book. And I would have to get like a D or F on it to lose my A, so whatever. One more day of actual classes! YAY! *Dances around* ;)
