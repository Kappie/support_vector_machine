The Whole Ten Yards  had a predictable plot, a stupid story, hammy overacting and lots of trying-to-be-funny jokes that weren't funny, but I didn't hate it.  I didn't love it and wouldn't recommend anyone to go see it, but I have an odd well of affection for the film.  The original was  a quirky, off beat experiment that more or less worked for me.  In the original Matthew Perry's jumpiness made sense, he was living next door to a professional hit man, his wife wanted him whacked and his assistant was the whacker hired to do it, and Bruce Willis' steel gaze was the perfect compliment.  The problem with the sequel is neither character behaves in a believable way.  That said my affection for the film can be summed up in two words-Amanda Peet.  This is a bad movie and she knows it and still she crackles in every scene.  Why this actress, so lit up and bubbly from the inside has not become a major star is a blight on the entertainment industry.  For fair disclosure Peet stared in one of my favorite television series of all time  Jack  Jill , and I've been a fan ever since.    Her filmography is an odd dichotomy- there's no such thing as a good Amanda Peet movie (that I've seen, the exception being  Igby Goes Down , but that was a minor role) yet there's no such thing as a bad Amanda Peet performance.  It's a testament to her talent that I'm giving  The Whole Ten Yards  a slight pass on the merit of her performance alone.  Now let's go Kill Bill!
