I guess in all reality nothing bad happened, i was just in a bad mood, and all quiet and stuff, and then i hung out with jessie which is always fun cause she rocks. And then my mom went crazy cause she expects jessie to be my chauffeur which is just stupid... its not her job to drive me around, and so she came to get me and she was yelling and she should just take responsibility for her own child or let me get my fucking liscense.  I think ive started to sleepwalk, i went to bed last night and i woke up this morning in different clothes and all the candles in my room were lit.  And i dont remember changing or lighting all my candles and why would anyone else do that at 7am? I dont know. and my candles hadnt been burning long, maybe like a 1/2 hour cause the wax wasnt all melted. Wierd.  I cant go to the last group tomorrow which makes me sad. My mom is a bitch and even though its my last group, she wont let me miss a minute of my classes to say goodbye to the people i probably wont ever talk to or see ever again since im moving to new vista and i wont be in the fairview girls group any  more. And im going to miss that. My mom is stupid, she's taken away all thats helping me and replaced it by yelling at me and being crazy. I swear shes going insane... her brain is like melting cause of her MS. She doesnt remember things and she is crazy. And i got in the car and she just started lecturing me about how i should be, how i'm not, what im not doing, what i should be doing/ dressing like/ acting like/ making friends with...all of that. She should not be insane and just BACK THE FUCK OFF.  When i talk to people lately, i feel creepy and stupid.  And i hate the people at my school. Seriously. they think they know everything and they'll fight their opinion they know nothing about. Like in my World History class we're talking about what an idiot Bush is and my whole class just starts talking about how they know how the terrorists are stupid and violent and they know how the people on 9/11 in the airplanes didnt care they were about to die. HOW DO THEY KNÃ˜W? were they there? NO! And all these dumb kids were tlaking about dnd in my math class and i mean, i know shit about dnd, but they're just so... ignorant! they make all this shit up and parade around like they know everything. And theyre all loud and stupid and.... ignorant. ::slice slice::  Anyway. I better go check into an ugly home... Or i better do my homework, so my mom is less insane...  Sorry for the dramatic post.   41313y
