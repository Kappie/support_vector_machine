Kayley, I love you, because your sarcastic and babyish  I'm drinking lemonade, how gay?  I don't wanna die when I'm drober  Letty's a tranny  Flies Undone, I prefer it this way  This will be my last one, after this...  And I found this article in a magazine. Justin Hawkins said it from the Darkenss (this is Jess now!!!)  I think we're an improvement on sliced bread  Well after Tabby was dragged home we went out and it was really boring. When we went home Letty's mum's boyfriend fullon shouted at her and Letty started crying because she wanted her Dad back, he died 2 years ago. It was really horrible to see her so upset. he called her "a selfish, manipulative cow." I really felt like smacking him! I went to church, boring. I'll write more tomorrow Love Y'all xxxxxxxxxxxx
