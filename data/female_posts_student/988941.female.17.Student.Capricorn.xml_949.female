Not much else really, apart from when I was doing duties yeterday there was about 200 kids swarming, it was blatanlty obvious that something was happening, but what did we do? nothing. We decided it looked too scary and they were taller than us, so we just watched. Then teachers of all shapes and sizes started running after them, shouting and yelling at them and each other. It later aspired that there was some kinda major fight and then two other serious isolated incidents, and we did nothing. Makes me feel quite guilty really. Hey ho, life goes on.
