Then you met her, and now look whats happened to you Your a slut and oh so bitchy  Part of me wants to stay your friend Help you change back to the loving person you were But now, knowing helping you would never end I'll leave you with her  I hope you have a good life Dont end up with a baby at sixteen Find a nice man, be his loving wife He'll be a good king, you be a nice queen
