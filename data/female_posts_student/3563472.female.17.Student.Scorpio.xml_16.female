Yet, we have social classes, organized government, elected leaders, and standards. So... like organized chaos. Maybe I'm interpretting the quote differently than he meant it. What are your thoughts?   Also, have you ever looked  a slab of meat and thought it was rather disgusting? because that's what i generally think when i look at it. Not that i'm a animal right's activist or that i'm imagining a dead animal on my plate, but the first time i looked at raw meat... it really ruined eating for me... at least for awhile
