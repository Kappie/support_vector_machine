The promotional tools to be used are simple, yet, insightful and easily recognizable logos, via adhesive form.  These "stickers" display the unique and easily identifiable logo of Paola Zamora, utilizing her self-designed Frek initiative.  They are to be placed in publicly accessible areas frequently visited by potential clients.  These locations are to be established using a marketing analysis model which is threefold. Primarily, the model will determine ideal candidates for Frek services, including but not limited to size of business, type of business, and place of business.  Secondarily it will identify locations these potential clients may visit either with the intention of finding graphic design services and/or utilizing undercover marketing procedures. Tertiary, the analysis should also provide geographic and demographic background as well.   The adhesives contain the following information leading clients to the web address of business services provided by Paola Zamora, through Frek design.
