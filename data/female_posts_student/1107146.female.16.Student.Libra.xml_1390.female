I was just kinda sitting there for 5 minutes wondering "humm....there's nothing on the other end of the line.  What should I do?" Yeh, but it was a good thing you didn't call back.  My mother came in "check" on me like 10 minutes later.  She would have been pissed if I was still talking.  How are the cokes going?  Obviously you must not have gotten bored yet, or else I would be getting a lovely little phone call....or have you been bored and decided to have a coke anyway?    Wow, Travis really was catch, wasn't he?  Can't wait for mission trip, where I get to spend a WHOLE week with him and his cousin!!!  Boy howdy, that'll be fun.   So, my weekend sucked for the people who didn't know that already.  I'm not really going to go into any details. You can get them all from Josh or Linds.  Where is everyone?
