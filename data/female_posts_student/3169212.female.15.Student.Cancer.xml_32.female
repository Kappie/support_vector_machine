(Turns camera so that it is pointed at Baka while she is on the phone)      Baka: (For some reason she is talking in an Italian-New York accent) Boss...Boss, please. I know I was supposed to hit this guy before today, but he's always surrounded by people who can kick my ass.      (Hito hooks up phone tap.)      Godfather: Baka, I have taken you under my wing. All I ask for is respect and understanding. If you can't give that to me, then I will have to disown you. If you know what I mean.      Baka: Godfather. I apologize, but I need more...      Hold on a second. Can you hear that tapping?    Godfather:  Yeah!    Baka:  Oh crap!  The feds!    (Baka slams the phone back on the hook)    (She runs to where Hito is hiding and finds the source of the tapping)    Baka:  Why you...!    (Screen goes fuzzy)
