And a few boys.  heheheh! *tssss! no! stop thinking!   But wait. Its a sleepover!  toot  woot* haha  Today I am having the SAC girls come over for a lil get-together. Some of them I haven't seen for seven months..others four months..others 24 hours! Yet oh boy I am excited. All the same ;) And not only are they coming over. But my cousins from the coast are also visiting  John Lennon will also make an appearance. How exciting! So much to do in so little time! geh! I miss these girls so much! For 11 years, they were my backbone, my zone, my friends, my vents, my support, my prozac - my happiness. Since the time I have moved schools (to good old Oakhill), they have never failed me, disappointed me, neglected nor forgotten me. And I am so proud to have them as my friends! We have all travelled down this long road together, since pre-school for some of us. They know me inside  out - I know them inside  out. And at this time, this vitally critical moment in time, right now or lately as it seems - these girls are the only ones who I can really depend on. They have seen me go through so much! And I am utterly proud to have them here in my life - love you so so much!  -- who? melbourne? forgotten. --
