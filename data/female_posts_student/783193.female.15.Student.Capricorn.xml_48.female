It's a good thing we didn't break down and cry like some other girl who was sitting out on the benches. I'm thinking about joining cross country, just to keep in shape. Or to get in shape, whatever. I've had a whole weekend to get my life together and out of slight depression, and I think I've done it. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, ya'll. After all, in ten years, I won't care a bit that I didn't make the freshman volleyball team and Sarah did, because I had planned to quit playing sophomore year anyway. There'll be more opportunities to come. Come on you guys, these are the little things. Wait until we all have families, and more. Then we'll really know how to set our priorities straight. School has been okay, not the best, but not the worst. I had a pretty hectic first day, but so much for living in the past. Everything's rushing by, and I'm determined to make the best year I can. Tonight we're having a practice for our quartet. We're performing on the 14th in the Castro Valley Fall Festival in The Village. Hope to see you there. One last thing. I don't think I can keep this journal up, and I refuse to write a bunch of mumbo-jumbo with no punctuation or articulation whatsoever, so I might just have to end it, due to lack of time. This is a maybe. So don't bug me about when I'm going to write my next entry, because I really don't know. Sorry, everyone. Later days.
