Well woop-dee-doo, guess who has a Freshman class 1rst hour!!!!??? Me! Some freshmen know there place. These ppl walk into class like they own the friggin place! Yellin' and acting the fool! They are sooo unruly and rude.  It's sickening how they start talking about each other and making fun of ppl that are in class w/ them, and they are in the same grade. I mean, most of us upper classmen at least have some kind of respect for each other! If there are any freshmen reading this, Please try and act your age. And also remember that you annoy the Seniors, and...we will let u know about yourself whether you like it or not. oh, and we can Spork you to. So watch out.
