Now thats over with....       Its the start of the summer holidays, and you would think that i would be glad, but no.7 weeks of pure boredom doesnt really seem appealing, even if it does allow me to escape from the likes of 'Treadders' (Becca would call him pretty, i would call him my slightly cheesy Blodge teacher), and also long,depressing hours of endless coursework.But i suppose theres a bright side to the situation, even if i havent found it yet,Oh well.       So to my mates 'Hewwo and enjoy me raving on for as many days as i can be bothered to fill this darn thing in!'       To you lot 'Just hewwo!'.
