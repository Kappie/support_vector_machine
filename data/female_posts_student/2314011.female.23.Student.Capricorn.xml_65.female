Worked hard at school, both in classes and out of them.  Came home to a message from Carrie, whom I've missed over the past few weeks while her phone sage raged across the country.  Found out Erika's (the instructor) chants/songs haven't gone anywhere; they're just waiting for her voice to rest.  And am now settling into the night with some hot soup in preparation for the Jack  Karen Hour.  Yes, it's been a good day.
