I’ve seen people who support the amendment to the Constitution, waving around their bibles and their “God Abhors You” signs. I’ve seen people that support gay marriage with their rainbow t-shirts and protest signs as well. And I still go with what my gut told me when first asked whether I supported Gay Marriage or not. Yes.  I support the prospect of a man and a man or a woman and a woman getting married. I do not believe that being gay is evil, or a sin, or that God hates gay people. I believe that marriage is love, not the union of a man and a woman.   As I said in my last entry, the Bible has been written by man, and translated many times over, also by man. According to Christianity, man is imperfect, correct? So who’s to say that some parts of the Bible are inaccurate? Who’s to say that those who wrote the passages in the Bible that are homophobic didn’t slant the information, or that the people who translated the Bible were, somewhere along the line of translations that have been done, incorrect? Or- here’s a silly idea, but it’s possible- maybe you’ve heard that, since the bible has been translated so many times, there are potentially hidden messages written acrostically or diagonally that are missed because the meaning isn’t the same in other languages as it was in the original text of the Bible? Well, what if there was something like that in the homophobic parts of the Bible that read “This is total Bullshit, please disregard it”? I’d laugh myself stupid if that was the case.’’  Also, has anyone ever heard of a little thing called SEPARATION OF THE CHURCH AND STATE??? People shouldn’t be letting their religion get in the way of politics. If there were to be a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, then the constitution would be contradicting itself.  All in all- marriage is whatever a couple wants it to be, and no one should be telling people that God abhors them because they’re different.
