Girl, you’re out of your mind I’m counting on UFO’s to beam me up I just don’t know how long I can take this shit I’m over it, girl you gotta go  [Chorus] It’s over, were over Just like in crimson and clover We’re sinking and I’m thinking How the hell did we get so stupid? It’s the end, ex-girlfriend I don’t care what you think of me now So long you’re gone This is the breakup song  One more thing before you go Would you please give me my records back My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, Cheap Trick, and Back in Black You can keep the dog we bought But you can’t go near the Standard Bar Don’t hang around, don’t call my friends The won’t know who you are!  [Chorus X2]   THIS IS THE BREAKUP SONG!  Gotta love the first verse!!! OCD!! GIRL UR OUTTA UR MIND! hahaha love it.
