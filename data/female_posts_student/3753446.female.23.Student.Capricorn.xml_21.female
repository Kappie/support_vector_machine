I decided to wear a big poofy blue prom dress to several places around University Circle, social psych class, down the street, VA medical center, on an RTA, Thwing center, and the Baha'I club cultural dinner--for the duration of an afternoon. I chose this because although I would violate a norm, I felt like dress code is a social norm that would be something that could be "positively" violated, that is, no one would get angry or get in trouble for this prank, and I felt that was important since it was just an experiment. To plan this, the day before the experiment, I spoke with my VA lab director to make sure she was aware that I was fully sane and doing this for class and not to lose my job (the idea of working with lab rats in a prom dress struck her as very funny, admittedly, but she said Ok and that she couldn't wait to see it.). So, I came back to my room during my lunch break and took my dress to my first class in a bag, since I didn't have time to change, and changed in between that class and my social psych class. When I took the dress out of the bag in the Baker 1st floor restroom (my dressing area), I realized that I had forgotten to grab my nice shoes and a matching "hijab" (the scarf I wear on my head). I was getting a little nervous about that, and even contemplated waiting until the next day to do this experiment. However, I pushed myself against my own doubts to not only don the dress, but accompany it with the hiking boots, white ankle socks, and maroon hijab that I already had on me. Regardless of how beautiful the dress was, I was less concerned with looking out of place than with looking just plain tacky with the clunky boots and mismatched headgear. I ran into Jessica in the bathroom and she guessed that I was doing this for my project, but I told her not to tell anyone, and she didn?t. In addition to looking funny, I arrived late to class, my dress making a "swish swish" sound with every step, whereupon I heard lots of laughter as I tried to find a seat as quickly yet nonchalantly as possible. When Natalie asked for examples of projects, I raised my hand and mentioned another incident that I had done previous to this class (passing out smiley stickers to ER patients). At that point, I felt like everyone was watching me: "So, if you did that ER thing for your extra credit? what's with the ball gown??" At least, that was the effect I was hoping to achieve. I wanted to control for the bias of our psych class. After a while, no one seemed to notice my fashion faux pas, but on my way out of the building, I caught one male student giving me a really weird look as I dragged the tail end of my dress (its easy to clean off luckily) up the stairs. I went to KSL after that to check my email, and made it a point to walk around the 1st floor a lot.. to use the bathroom, to visit a friend, to check my email, etc. I ran into three friends, who all asked me why I was so dressed up. I said I just felt like it. They said I looked "really nice" and laughed when I revealed my hiking boots. One of them, the only guy of the three friends, didn?t say a word to me when he typically is very talkative with me, so I found that interesting. By this point, I was having fun and forgot the inconveniences of wearing a prom dress, so I swished around the 1st floor some more, wrote a couple of email, and headed out to work again. As I walked to the VA medical center where I do research, I saw a Greenie coming and I was near a stop. I raised my hand and started to move to the stop, and the Greenie passed me by. However, that could have just been a really picky Greenie driver too, since I wasn't yet exactly* at the greenie stop. When I got to the hospital, I entered through the main hospital entrance instead of the research building entrance I normally go through, and walked nonchalantly through the waiting room. Heads definitely turned. I saw them. I bought a chai from the coffeestand, and as I waited in line, a male nurse (perhaps in his late 30's )approached me and asked me if I knew "some girl who looked just like" me and had a bookbag like me who worked in research. Some research study that had to do with dogs?? I said, no I didn't. He then asked me what I did and where, I told him research and gave him a very vague response as to where (it was a little scary) "I work in research.. in the research building." He suddenly got really animated and said "It's YOU!" So I corrected him and told him a little bit about my research. He tried to ask me some questions about ant brains and whether or not I found them fascinating too? I think he was just trying to make conversation. I know nothing about ant brains, so I had to shrug him off in order to get to work. I was able to do my lab work without any problem, and afterward, I went back to the waiting room and sat very conspicuously right next to the TV, so that anyone watching TV (which was everyone), would have no choice but to see me. I sat there for 20 minutes, looking around the room, even examining the sign that pointed to the Mental Health ward (I thought it would be a nice touch). I caught about 3 "one-time only starers" and 5 "repeat starers" out of the 20 people in the room. One man approached me and told me I have a lovely complexion. (What the???). After 20 minutes, I got up and walked out to wait for the bus. I got on the RTA, using my handy dandy RTA pass, accompanied by two men with prosthetic legs. There were only two passengers on the bus already, and they didn?t seem to be fully alert to what was happening, so I had an uneventful ride over to Euclid. From there I went to Thwing center, where I spoke with a couple of my friends who were highly impressed by my dress and made me spin around princess-style for them in the Thwing atrium. It was Elyse and Jackie from social psych, no less.  They also wanted to know if it was a special day and why I dressed up so nice. I said that I just felt like it, and they gave me an understanding, "oh?" I could see that they weren't exactly satisfied with my answer, but they made it sound like they understood anyway. It was the social norm of politeness, I felt. At this point, I went to the Baha'I club dinner a half hour early. I am not an active member of the club though I am on the mailing list and know the president really well. I walked in, and though I didn't know anyone but Aaron, asked if they needed any help setting up. They were a little surprised at first, but then welcomed the assistance. Swishing around the Thwing ballroom in my ballgown and hiking boots, I set up the tea and coffee table and the programs. Aaron and some of his friends were standing with me at one point when a middle aged man who had come to attend the dinner introduced himself. Speaking only to Aaron, he said, in total seriousness, "I'm guessing you guys are all from Baha'I club right? And it looks like she [referring to me] just kind of wandered in?" Perhaps he was kidding, but he really seemed to disapprove of my presence at their cultural dinner for "good people," since I looked out of place. Aaron flashed me a "Yo Sanjida, disregard what he said" look. I wasn't offended but I didn't respond to him either. In fact, after the rest of the day's glares and politeness, I was surprised that the man had made a comment directly about my belongingness at this particular event. During the dinner, I received several comments that I looked nice and they loved my dress. I noted one friend who had a nice sweater and nice pants on, even say that she felt "really underdressed" for the occasion... although the occasion was clearly semi-casual to casual, and not a formal affair by any means. At Thwing I ended up telling my friend Hadele, about this experiment. I really felt like telling someone about my day's experiences. She promised not to tell until the dinner was over, but was the first to admit to me that yes, my outfit was tacky and that she was shocked I didn't match my hijab to my outfit as I usually do. I realized something at that point. Throughout the day, I really had to know that SOMEONE nearby, be it Jessica in class, my lab director at the VA, or Hadele at the dinner, knew that I was still a "normal" person, that I was not crazy and that this was "just for a class." It reflected my own insecurity about being different from others. That was probably the most interesting thing I learned from doing this, because at first I didn't even realize I was following this pattern everywhere I went in my dress. I walked home with Yasamin and Amit. After I debriefed them post-dinner, Yasamin said that "several" people had approached her during the dinner and said "Sanjida looks really nice today." I suppose that some people may have decided that since I had "tried" so hard to "look nice," the fact that I didn't match didn't matter (E for effort?), and overall, to them, I did "look good." However, another possible explanation is simply the social norm of polity. It is "common knowledge" that one should not criticize someone to their face because it might hurt their feelings. That is, keep the negative opinions to yourself, and express the positive. It is probably a good thing that we do this, survival wise. I don't think everyone would want to know what I totally honestly think of them at some time or another, and I don't think I would want to know what they totally honestly think of me at some time or another. So, it makes me wonder how often we are truly sincere in what we say to others. Had I not told anyone ahead of time about my project incentive, I probably still would do this activity, but only if I could debrief everyone afterwards. It is important to me that people see me as a rational person. My concern about my impressions on others, especially those friends and people who know me well, overshadowed my desire to be unique to the extreme. Also, my self-consciousness probably colored my attributions to others' behavior or intentions in what they said to me all day long. I don't see any way to avoid that false judgment when breaking the norm. I would definitely dress up again just for fun on a school day, but probably not to the point of breaking out a prom dress. If I ever DO break out the prom dress again, at the very least, my hijab and shoes have GOT to match. There just ain't another way to do it.
