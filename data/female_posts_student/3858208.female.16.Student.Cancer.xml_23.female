I decided last night at about 2am that I'm not letting my years in high school go to waste. I'm going to work my ass off and try to graduate in at least the top 20% of my class, 10% if I can manage it. Wish me luck.  Does anybody know anything about getting a book published?    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  annoyed at the dogs  listening to/watching ::  my mom's music in the living room  eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  nothing  talking to ::  nobody...the dogs  thinking about ::  the future  wishing ::  I could decide what I want to do with my life.  wearing ::  Blue sweatpants and a blue Fox tank top  random ::  I don't feel very good right now.
