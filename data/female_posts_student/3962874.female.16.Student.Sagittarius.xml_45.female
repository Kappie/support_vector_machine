Amanda ended up drinking 3 1/2 shots of 80 proof and little bit of 100 proof Yukon Jack. Her friend only drank 1 and a half shots of Vodka but she ended up being a little bit of a lightweight anyway. Within half an hour, they were both hot and outside. Then they started to get stumby and now they are talking slow, walking crooked, and falling over. Alex has friends over so this is our entertainment. Everyone is laughing at Amanda but she has no idea what is so funny. At one point I was laughing so hard I accidentaly peed my pants a little smidgin. Don't tell. haha. She is really really talkative and my brother doesn't seem very happy about it but I think she is hilariously tipsy. You can smell her breath from a couple feet away and her face is bright red. I keep thinking I wish I had a video camera right now. I think I want to buy a digital camera, but now is the perfect time for a camcorder. Wow they both just fell on the floor. They pretended to kiss when they were outside and now all the guys think they are lesbians. Fun stuff.  Two hours later: Amanda must be going crazy. She sucked my big toe, licked the bottom of my foot, ate peanut butter off her friends foot, and even hit on Daniel. She is acting very wierd, hopefully she will be embarassed or hungover tomarrow and learn her lesson. I doubt she is going to get sick.
