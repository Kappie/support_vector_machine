I downloaded the shareware version of Wolfenstien 3D from the internet last night.  Anyone who remembers this game understands why I downloaded it.  This game was the coolist!  The begining of first person shooters, this game started it all.  Now I think I should say that I really hate first person shooters, but I loved this game.  I didn't like Doom, which came shortly after, but Wolf3D was a bad ass game, hands down!  Now after downloading and setting it up I find that it won't run on a windows platform.  So in order to play this game I am going to have to close out windows completely and run it from dos.  I've given this a try but my keyboard doesn't seem to want to work without windows.  Stupid crapy keyboard!  So now I am wondering if I should just call it quits?  Wondering if it's worth the trouble to play this awsome game?  I think I am going to give it a few more tries before I say Bonjor, Aloha, goodbye.    While watching G4TechTV I came across this really cool thing they're putting out now.  It's a joystick that you plug into your tv and it has games loaded onto it, such as pong and frogger.  Just plug it in and play, no additional game purchase necessarly.  Now you can play Pac-man on your tv with just the Joystick.  It's like a little arcade game in the palm of your hand, from the comfort of your living room.  Very cool!  So I am off to try Wolf3D once more... I really hope it works, I LOVE that game!
