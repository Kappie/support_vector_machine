You kinow, something just occurred to me...if Alstadt were to ever by some chance read this, A.) I'd never have a chance of making WE again or B.)I'd feel terrible or actually...both! Yikes. Maybe I need to stop writing about Alstadt in here. I know I wont because he makes me mad a lot, but...maybe I can try to talk about him less. Anyway, I'm off to school. YaY? Byebye!
