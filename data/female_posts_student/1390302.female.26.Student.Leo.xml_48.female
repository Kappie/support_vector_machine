Aparently the all too inappropriate country trio have decided that they are going to be rockers now and want nothing to do with Country music now.  Why?  I can't say.    Earlier in the year, at a March 10th Concert in London, their lead singer Natalie Maines said; "Just so you know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas."   The comment raised quite a ruckus, fans were dropping them like a bad hairdo, people were trying to get refunds for their concert tickets, it seemed at the time that their little loud mouth stunt had cost them dearly.  They refused to refund the tickets already purchased for their sold out concerts and they were regreting the decision to make such an unfounded remark in public.    Now, it seems that their indescression has blown over.  They're selling out their concerts again and have fans again the U.S. I myself used to be a fan of the Dixie Chic's, yet in light of their disrespectful comment about the President of the United States, I find myself disgusted with their complete lack of respect for the souls of those who lost their lives on 9/11.  Their comment was disrespectful to the families of the dead, the people who died in this terrible and to the Troops who were traveling to the Middle East to defend the right of our country to live free.    Nowm  dixie chicks are "getting out of Country music" and I can't help but smile.  In my mind and from my point of view, they have lost their fan base and now have to move on.  The country music community has risen up and said "shame on you!" The fans of the world listened, and now they have no choice but to get away from all of the bad publicity.  Now it's true that Natalie Maines has come out with a  urlLink public apology  yet that does very little to change the fact that it was said.  It shows how little patriotism they actually have, which is a major factor in Country Music, and to its fans!  Shame on them!!!  ~ Kristyn
