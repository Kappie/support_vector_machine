And "kylla" with two dots over the "a". That did make sense, actually, there's always only been one noted record a week.   FINNISH IS GREAT AND WE'RE ALL LEARNING IT. Man, is it cool.  Your Finnish word for the day is:   suomi  ....which means " Finland " in Finnish!!!! Kylla!!  WTF? What other reasons? C'mon Will, we're all open here.  It's true, Abby probably will have to call and remind me, and I'll make a feeble excuse about a butterfly, then mutter something else incomprehensible and non-sensical, and then, fly like a bat out of hell to the...church. Yeah. Redundancy is awesome.
