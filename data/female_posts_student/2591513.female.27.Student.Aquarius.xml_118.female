I am looking around and thinking that I should maybe clean my desk and for those of you who have seen it you will know why.  LOL  Okay so maybe I am not the most organized or neatest person.  I will admit to that.  I am however working on it...I think that the best way to describe me is that I am a work in progress.  I seem to be a really big project.  LOL  Sometimes in life all you can do is just laugh.  I am watching "Cheaters."  I haven't watch that show in a long time.  I think that it is a pretty messed up show.  I mean I wouldn't want to have the public know that my husband is cheating me.  I would like to find out on my own and probably tell a selected few.  I was once very scared of Ed cheating on me, more along the lines of paranoid.  I have learned that I have to trust him and that I cannot take everything as him cheating.  He comes home to me and he loves me.  It was a very hard thing for me to learn mostly because I was young and yes STUPID, but through it all we are here and stronger.  I think back to how damn STUPID I was and wonder why it took so long to really GROW UP.  I really am changing and the change that is happening is making me feel a lot better about myself.  I can't explain it.  Oh so anyway, my kids were great today.  Bailey drove me a little batty when he didn't do what I asked him to do.  He is also whining a lot...hell it is him and Nalani.  I guess it is just the thing for them to do.  I don't know.  Oh well.  Well I also wanted to say a Happy Birthday to Jessica.  I hope you have a great year.  I can't wait until Ed comes home.  I am actually bummed that he is missing out on Father's Day.  It is sad because the kids were looking forward to it, well mostly Bailey.  I guess we can celebrate it when he gets back home.  As long as we are together that is what counts, right?  Well for now that is all that I have left in my mind...for now.
