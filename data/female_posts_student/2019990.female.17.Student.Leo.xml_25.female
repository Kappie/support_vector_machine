But I don't really understand how to update the sidebar, so I'm sorry to my chatterbox visitors, but Mahinda is going to help me fix it tomorrow so never fear.  On a good note I had my last day of Spanish EVER today!! *Hallelujah Hallelujah.  Heavenly light streams down*  And my quiz is now functional, but most every one has taken it already so what can you do.  But I have finals to prepare for.  Have a wonderful evening.
