I will need some break from the Millenium Project.  Maybe an eating contest?  HEH HEH HEH, I might win this one (maybe).  Or maybe we could just...  I don't know, light my farts on fire?  or not?  let's just say this, let's not get almost arrested by the cops.  And can we invite Pink pants Brian?  He is a good fellow and I like his house.  WORD to my hoes in every area code.
