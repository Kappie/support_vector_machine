On that note -- please don't link my blog to yours anymore, ok?  If it's not linked it'll be harder to find.  You can put it in your favorites or whatever, just not where everyone can see it.  And I won't be linking any blogs to mine.  But yeah...  I feel shitty, and I think that I might've gotten sick from the heat on Sat.  Heat exhaustion or something... idk.  Anyway, I'm gonna go back to playing on neopets (don't laugh).  Later.
