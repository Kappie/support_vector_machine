It’s a big old ‘I’m a teenager and what the heck is that MOUNTAIN on the left side of your chin? Em? Em?’. That’s what its like.  Meghan sent Seth a new album, its by ‘Copeland’ and I absolutely adore it. I burned a copy and every chance I get I pop it in. Its really funny though, I noticed a lot of the theme seems to lean towards lovers being apart and missing each other. Hmmm, that’s interesting, no?
