I allowed this man to tret me like crap... it was my own fault after the second chance, and 2000+ chances, i guess i finally figured it out...  boy oh boy have i been an idiot and the future prolly holds some idiocy as well... oh wellzers  i am single now and loving it... i never miss ant... must not be love...  A RESOUNDING..... duh echoes through the hall...
