Plus the computers throwing a wobbly cause it's going funny...maybe that's my eyes. Sorry, it's just kind of hard to type good stuff when you feel awful. (It's even harder to hit the right buttons and make sense of what you're hitting (EH?)) I know, I know. Mmm maybe it's a you've-been-on-the-computer-for-too-long things! Hey so any way I was thinking, why does every one have to be selfish? I guess you have to be to survive. See, I'm ill! Either I'm ill or mad. No comment please! Doesn't the word either look german? Ether. Hmm fun! Geez way too sick! Any way did you know that I've typed 100+ blogs. Hello Katie, does any one care? Good point. Hey I better go crawl into a hole now. Yeah, it better be full of paracetamol. Mmm now I'm having a can't-remember-if-I've-done-that thing. I think it's called amneisa. Yup, if I could spell it, it would be. Any one know where to get a good spell checker? Or a brain. Mmmm. Aargh! I really need to go! I almost got squashed by my bookcase then! It almost fell on me! Hehe. Local girl dies by being hit by bookcase. Greeeat. Bubi. Be happy that you're healthy cause you don't know how long it's gonna last. Depressing huh?
