Life in Candyland is just peachy.  I wish i could paint- it might be fun, but you know how people just stay in states, like if they get brain damaged at a certain age and they cant learn anything beyond that...well thats me, except with art- i have the talent of a 5 year old... hell maybe 4.  All i know is that leslies kid sister surpassed my artistic talent long ago.  Blogs are weird.  well mine are.  They remind me of that movie with Nicholaus Cage and Chris Cooper -Adaptation- Cage is always talking to himself in his head and he just goes off about stuff like how weird he is and his faults and what hes doing and well... to make a long story short thats how i feel when i write here- knowing damn well no one will read this, and praying that no one will.  It's better than a journal though, for one-I'd rather type,  and for two- well theres always that feelin of living on the edge, that ~what if someone does read this.. ha, how gay will they think i am... but i am pretty stupid, i guess its time for people to know that~   anyways on with the show.  My mom called me  elitist    today.  I dont think i am.  picky yes, god knows i am, but elitist... there are so many people out there 90 times worse than i can imagine, so i guess what i am saying is i disagree with my mom.   Aww Rian.. he is my favorite nephew.. and only one.  I love the kid- his laugh lightens my day.  Anyhoo... i think i have babbled enough for tonight.   So In the words of Cartman...  "Do not open your eyes until moring, or else i will kick you in the nuts...square in the nuts"  Until Time Next
