We got ready and stuff and then went to the Pasta House. Zach Cook, Zach Capriola, Squeeb, Richard, Brett, Matt, Kaci, Emily, Goodson, Emily, Cort, Lindz, and I all went to dinner together. It was very nice.   And then we headed to the dance. (Operation Wallpaper didn't succeed, Kaci and Emily, but it will by the end of this year!!!) Everyone looked so nice. Especially the guys in ties. Kaci and I have a fetish over guys in ties.   And now I'm back home, nice and comfy in my pajamas, which is a nice change from my dress because I haven't been able to breathe since 3:30! I took my hair down, and it's all gunky with hair spray, but I'll just wash it in the morning.  A bunch of guys are over at Squeeb's house, and I contemplated on asking Sarah if she wanted to go over there and crash it with me, but I decided against it. Hehe.
