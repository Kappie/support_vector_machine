Jhonen Vasquez is   If you've never discoverd Invader Zim, here's the premise: Aliens known as the Irken have decided to take over the universe (presumably the second time). Shortly after finishing assigning each of the top Irken soldiers to their own planet to conquer, Zim returns from his banishment to Foodcourtia. Of course, the leaders are all too happy to send him on a mission far, far away just to get rid of him- unfortunately, Zim really does find a planet out in the middle of nowhere, known as Earth. Armed with all sorts of Irken gadgets and a crazy robot-dog-thing named Gir, Zim single-handedly wages war on Earth- and the token conspiracy nut, Dib. Wacky hijinks occur.  I can't really explain it any more clearly than that. You just kinda have to see it. The first season is currently available for $25 or so, with 9 episodes and some extra content on it. Nifty!  --  In other news, I am currently listening to an Asian man reproduce Van Halen. On a violin. You heard me correctly.  Sharing the 3: http://www.bobbyyang.com/video/750kb.htm
