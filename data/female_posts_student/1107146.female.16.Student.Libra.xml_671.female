I don't listen to much, but I might as well be. Every song has such an EMO background to it.   Maybe just a grunge kid. Shit, I don't know what I am. Perhaps I'm nothing. That ain't so bad.  And as you all know, Sbox is sort of defunct. I'm not, but the collective is. Sigh. So...yes. We were working on Linds's drumming skills today. She learned the fundamentals of drummer's language.  DumDumBahtikDumtikDumDumPAHtitiTISSS.  I just saw Revolutions. Damn, what a fugg'd up movie. I need sleep.  Hm.
