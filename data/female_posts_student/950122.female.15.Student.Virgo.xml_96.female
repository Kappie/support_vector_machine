We talked mostly about buying Jeth's car. Tee hee. After a while, Patrick, one of Jeth's first friends when he got to Virginia, came over. While he and Jeth were looking at pics he took, Maelle and I were in Vanessa's room, messing around with her uniform hats and canteens. We had so much fun! Patrick ended up stayin for dinner, and after dinner we went out to Baskin Robbins to buy ice cream. Vanessa drove Jeth's car, which was manual, and it's probably by the grace of God that I'm still alive today. Jeth and Patrick, the "Stick Masters", were supposed to teach her how to drive manual. When we finally got to Baskin Robbins, we each got lots of ice cream. Yum. =) Surprisingly, Maelle finished hers last. :O We got a gallon of gas, then we ran an errand for my aunt. We were supposed to just buy dishwashing liquid, but we ended up staying there for a while. Vanessa, Maelle and I were just staring at all the facial products there were. O_o When Jeth finally called us to find out where we were, I expected them to be in the electronics section or something, but lo and behold, they were in the candy section. XD  Jeth drove us home from there. It was a pretty smooth ride. We watched American Idol while Jeth fixed Maelle's computer. Jeth left his computer to her. *pout* Oh well. We played cards afterwards. Texas Holdem, Egyptian Poker.. well, I forgot the names. Patrick left at about 10pm. I wonder if he'll visit us in the Philippines.  At the airport today I tried to convince Uncle Ernie to visit us in December. I threatened to spam his e-mail if he didn't. XD  Well, I'm off to Honolulu. I wonder if Chloe still remembers me.. *shudder*
