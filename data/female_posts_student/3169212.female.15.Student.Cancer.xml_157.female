Baka:  That may be true, but you read Saiyuki.  You saw how they acted.  Kuronue:  Please, I've done worse.  Baka and Buddha:  *large collective gasp*  Kuronue:  What?  By the way, that wasn't exactly Japanese money.  It was demon money.  Baka:  *sing-song voice*  As I've said before, Makai money no good in Tortoise.  Kuronue:  You're starting to sound like Haruhara Haruko.  Baka:  I should invite her and Atomisk over.  Kuronue and Buddha:  No!  Baka:  Would you prefer Goku?  Kuronue:  I don't want a monkey here.  Baka:  He's not such a monkey.  Kuronue:  If you're going to invite some character from Saiyuki here, make it one of those women.  Baka:  Ew!  Kuronue:  Oh, I forgot, there's a kid here.  Buddha:  You're a vile person.  Kuronue:  What's your point?  Baka and Buddha:  *stares angrily at Kuronue*  Baka:  Remember when you said you should strike Kuronue down?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Now is the time to use that divine power.  Buddha:  That would make me a hypocrite.  Kuronue:  *sarcastically*  God forbid you become a hypocrite!  Buddha:  But if I must commit an act of blasphemy to get rid of you so be it.  *ball of energy forms in hands*  Kuronue:  Now, there's no need for that.  Buddha:  *throws chi in Kuronue's direction*  Kuronue:  *dodges quickly*  Jeez, for a god you have terrible aim.  *another ball of energy hits Kuronue in the stomach*  Ai!  Baka:  That was fun.
