XD First part, I got one third of multiple choices questions wrong (the teacher told me)... second part, I invented something for a question (equation derivation) and tried out stuff for two other questions which I'm sure aren't the answer. So half of the second part went bad. :P The last part was comprehension, explanations - did well for two, the other I'm not sure (I invented a bit... or rather, hoped it was true) blah.. But, I don't care. ^^;; I didn't care last night, then a little voice in my head at 1 a.m. told me: What if you fail? You might fail the course! and I was so scared I revised a while (but it didn't help... hn). And during the exam I didn't care much, and at the end I was like 'fuck it'. Erm. And I didn't use my cheat sheet at all. *shakes head* I never do... -_-   Anyway, biology exam tomorrow, for which I'm happy. Biology is fun 'n easy. Then French - boring, but also easy.  All I had in mind during the last few days, actually, is the Sublunary rp in which I participate. I invented and rp Kano, a vampire 104 years-old, with raven hair and red eyes... and pierced nipples. I wuv him. And I wuv Sekai (Kano wuvs him too ^_- ), the Aquilli (bird-boy... more like an angel with pointed ears, actually. He's got lots of rings and tattoos. *wheees*), I just wuv the pic Rei drew of him! ^^  Oh, and I'm going to accept the job offer at the stables. I don't want to be cashier or anything, and I'd need flexible hours in order to continue my riding lessons and being free to baby-sit. So, I'll sell my family's maple syrup during the summer, babysit when I'm needed, and be a camp monitor for two weeks. Sounds fun. ^^
