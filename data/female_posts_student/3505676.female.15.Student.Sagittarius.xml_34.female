A sweetheart like you would be best matched with a celeb who's as down-to-earth as you are. Someone who is cute and fun to be around is what it'll take to make your heart go pitter-patter. A cutie pie like Orlando Bloom is just what the love doctor ordered for you.  You and your perfect partner would have a blast on low-key dates away from all the glitz and glam of Tinseltown. What could be better than a quiet night at home with a movie, popcorn, and plenty of one-on-one time with your beloved? So, pop in a DVD and enjoy a cozy night with your celeb soul mate! And if your celeb soul mate can't make it, someone sweet is probably waiting to curl up with a cutie like you! So get out there and meet them!
