"I heard Henman's through to the final!" says Mickey excitedly. "Can't wait to check out his le - I mean, his moves. Moves. I was not just about to say legs. Moves. Ooh Lilo and Stitch! Can we get the DVD?" "I was thinking more of practising our songs. Our recording session didn't go too well yesterday." Jesse grunts. "Oh come on," says Adam, dragging himself off the armchair and making his way to their practice room, which they have padded with bits of sponge, cushion and bubblewrap to avoid the neighbours from complaining. "Nnnng," comes the grunt from Mickey, who starts to claim that somebody has stuck his bottom to the floor. "Oh Mickey get your lazy ass here and get on that bass," says Jesse, rolling off the couch and attempting to roll right into the practice room.  "I told you already! I'm stuck to the carpet!" "Oh you lazy old git," says Jesse, coming back to grab Mickey by the ear and drag him over to the practice room. They start playing. "Why aren't you playing or singing?" Jesse wonders.  "In case you hadn't noticed.." ".. Hey, wait a minute, where's Ryan?" "...Ryan is not here and we do not have drums backing, and you and Mickey are out of time. And Mickey seems to be playing Pop Goes the Weasel." "Doo doo doo doo," hums Mickey, jutting his head forwards and back (rather like a chicken) to an unknown beat. "So where the hell is Ryan??" demands Jesse. "Dunno. Call him on your cell phone," suggests Adam. "OK." "Well what are you waiting for??" Adam says irritably after about 5 minutes of watching Jesse fiddling with a thread on his trousers. "Don't have a cell phone." Adam heaves a huge sigh and buries his head in his hands.  I cannot believe I am stuck here with there loons,  he thinks.  It's a wonder I haven't cracked up yet.   "Well then call him using the regular phone!!" Adam yells.  "Adam, keep your wig on! I think.." Adam shoots a glare at Mickey who immediately shuts up.  Why do I live with a bunch of weirdos??  There is an awkward silence, after which Jesse creeps out quietly to use the phone in the hallway.  "Please stop looking at me like that," says Mickey quietly, his sanity curiousy returning to him.  "Sorry," says Adam, quickly averting his eyes to his guitar.   Everything is so fucking fucked up. Ryan isn't fucking here. Where the fuck is he? We can't do any fucking thing without the fucking drums. Jesse is fucking getting on my fucking nerves. Mickey has lost his fucking sanity. Jane fucking caught me with Malpreet. I don't even fucking know who I fucking prefer. I wish all this fucking fucked-up-ness would fucking go away. And I can't stop fucking swearing. Even in my fucking head.  I'm full of regret For all things that I've done and said
