So, um, that's really all I have to say, except that I hate choir, and I know Z is going to kill me for that, but that's how I feel.  I'm supposed to come home and take a nap everyday, but choir is definitely cutting in to that.  Oh, and the fact that we kind of got in a wreckish type thing today.  Since you're all dying of suspense, I'll tell you the story.  Lindsey Baylor, the girl that chauffers me back and forth from school, skipped 7th period today to go fill up with gas. On her way back into the parking lot, people were double parallel parked, and she thought she had enough room to get through, but unfortunately, she didn't.  Her rearview mirror smashed into her her passenger side window (where I would have been sitting, had I decided to skip with her) and the glass shattered all over, so we spent until almost 4:00 vacuuming out her car, and there are still glass shards in there (and embedded in my arms too, I might add) but it's better than it was. So, that is my only happy story for today.  Call if you want a sad one...heehee.  I don't have a sad one to give today.  Sorry. Oh, and for the people who know about the whole cousin (Megan) situation, she's probably back home now, but I can't be sure on that.  She added me to her buddy list, and since she didn't have a computer at her boyfriend's house, I'm assuming she's back home.  But you never can tell with her... My thought was that maybe she was at the library, but then it hit me.  This is Vinemont Alabama.  There ARE no libraries... So, I'm guessing she's home. TTFN (Ta-Ta For Now.) That's what my orthodontist tells me all the time.  He's so cute. (Like old man with baby-face cute, not like hot cute.)
