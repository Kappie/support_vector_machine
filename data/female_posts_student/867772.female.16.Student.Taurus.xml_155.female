Cause if they  really  didn't care what people thought of them, they wouldn't be anouncing it to the world. When people say they don't care what people think of them, all they really want is for people to think that they are the type of person who doesn't care what people think of them. But that's not really the type of person they are. Because obviously, they want people to think that they are a certain type of person.   If they really didn't care what people thought of them, they'd just shut up.  Yeah.
