Even in the EU, 18% of kids are overweight/obese. I just find this appalling, how it could ever have got this far. How in schools now, PE has been taken away, how in cafeterias they have pizza hutt and mcdonalds, and tons of soft drinks. I just find it appalling. I mean - don't people realise that they are subjecting themselves to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, infertility, gall bladder disease, osteoarthritis, and many forms of cancer?  It's also upsetting how many of my friends are on diets - or keep saying that they are fat (When they are skinny!), Food is such a hard issue for so many people, how we look, etc. I guess its peer pressure to look like models, be pretty, perfect...  Yesterday I went to Geneva with Elaine  Miranda. Elaine and I went on some upside down rides and that new 50 m high swinging one - ahhh - it was fun :) I could feel the blood rush to my toes!!! But the few of the lake was beautiful. Today we're biking to Signy centre to go shopping!  All summer we've been going to 'Differenciels', this is the place to be in Nyon. It's really funky, they have great paninis and salads. yum yum ! So I recommend it :-) ( urlLink http://www.differenciels.ch/ )
