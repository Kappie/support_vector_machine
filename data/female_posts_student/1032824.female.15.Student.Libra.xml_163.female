Today has been wonderful. Actually, the past coupla' days have been great. Oh yupp, think I forgot to update, I'm sandwiched between Gabriel (Fengrui) and Jeremy in the current seating plan and it's been rather fun sitting next to them. Martini sits two seats away from me, and  still  constantly teases me. He and Gabriel are always laughing at my  noob ness. Dang! This week has been a rather hectic week as well, because we have been having tests, tests and more tests! Good, at least it ensures that I revise my work. Okie dokie, time for dinner. Ciao lovers! Have fun tomorrow, graduating Clementeens.
