With an O"   Me: (friendly) "Oh. I was a major 'Durannie' back in the day, so I'm sure I won't forget your name now."  Her: (very nervously) "I'll take your word for it, I dont know any of their music, but I knew their name sounded like mine." Me: (smarty-pantsy) "Well, actually  they  didn't make up that name.  They got it from the film  urlLink Barbarella ...you know...with Jane Fonda?  '60?  Sci-fi?" (evil grin) Her: (hesitantly starts to sing the Beach Boys) "Ba-ba-baaa-ba-bar-branne..." Me: Right.  So? Coffee? (walking out of conference room)  I don't know what came over me.  She just annoyed me trying to act 'cool' knowing Duran Duran!  HOW DARE SHE!!  All's I'm saying is don't go comparing yourself to one of the greatest groups of the 80's if you don't even know their music!!  I mean, at least TRY and listen to ONE song.  Sheesh!!
