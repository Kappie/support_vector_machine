And- he's back. HE IS BACK! Oh no... I dunno how much more work he's going to criticise... And of course, the band room would be open again! To practise... Early in the morning, I woke up, a bit drowsy, my mouth very dry. It was kinda feeling sick... Then wash up, ate breakfast, on the computer then go back to sleep again and at about 3.30pm, I woke up again then went out to grab something to eat. Both my brother and my mother were mysteriously not at home... Then go everywhere just to find a file but can't find anything...sigh. Homework completed, but there's more things to worry about still...
