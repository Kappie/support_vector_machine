Just laying low tonight, watch movies and grill out some steaks. Tomorrow, I have to use my muscles again, to help my sister move her stuff. (Not looking forward to it)  But I am forceing myself to at least walk today, because I know it'll make the soarness better.  Tomorrow, I am heading out to sumerfest with my friend Angela and her boyfriend Kyle. They are so much fun to out with, we always have a good time.  Hopefully it'll be a great weekend, weather wize.
