Well I never really noticed it before but apparently google sort of scans you entries and does a quick ad search and then adds those ads to you page.  For example, on Melissa's I saw 2 ads- one for pepper spray/mace and the other for security b/c she wrote about her parents wanting her to be safe and wanting to get pepper spray.  Mine had/has ones about party supplies and Holiday Season tours, except I don't really know where that one came from.  But w/e.  Yeah, so that is my interesting insight for the day.  Enjoy.
