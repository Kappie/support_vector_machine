I figured I would try Special Effects brand and in a purple color since it's more highly recommended to me than Manic Panic. The only place in town that carries it, though, is Hot Topic (Sally's has everything BUT that brand). So I called Hot Topic and asked and the girl said they had it. I headed to our ghetto-fab mall (I kid you not) and get there only to find that they don't have any purple. The girl tells me I could mix a pink or red with blue though...um, yeah...like I'm forking out $30 for dye that I have to do myself. Bleh. So I ended up with what they did have which was Jerome Russell BWild!!! in Dark Plum and a pair of pirate-y shoelaces (skull  crossbones) for my Docs. I left it on my hair for as long as it said to and rinsed it out...of course, seeing the gorgeous purple water, swirling down the drain got me all excited so I actually used the hair dryer (on cold setting) to hurry up the drying process. Now, maybe after washing it with shampoo a time or two, it will lighten and be obviously purple...but right now it looks  black . Black isn't so bad, though as I can't see my roots (yay!) and I think I look better with dark hair, anyways. Think I'm going to grow out the bangs though as I'm tired of cutting them and pinning them back to keep them out of my eyes.       Other news...Our broadband connection resumes Tuesday around noon. We were going to go with DSL but since we're planning on disconnecting the home phone soon in favor of cell phones, it was going to be more expensive (you only get a good rate if you get the complete package from the phone co.). So we're going with cable again but a better package (3mb/sec) since we're only getting that and not the cable for tv turned back on.  First session is almost over. Only this week and next, I believe, and I'll be finished with the WMST  RGTE classes...which will just leave me with ARST (thru-session) until the first week of August and I'll be done with classes everyday by 1pm. XD
