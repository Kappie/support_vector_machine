It was Erik’s birthday so we spent the evening in Cedar Rapids at, of course you know where, the infamous ‘Chuck E Cheese’.  Blah.  But the girls and I skipped the end of the party and went to the mall for a little shopping.  I need a new messenger bag, but I just can’t find one.  There was a really soft ‘Ruff Hewn’ one, army green and everything, but it just wasn’t ‘essence’ as we would say.  Bah.  Plus I am trying to save money.  What for?  I am not sure.  Possibly one of the following.  (In order of least costly)  contacts, a laptop, a car.  Anywho.  Eeeek.  Mom was a grouch this morning, and Laura was a pain in the neck, screaming and what not.  I don’t know if I will ever understand that girl.  She just knows how to get Mom riled up, and she doesn’t know when to quit.  Eh.  So Emily and I tried to keep things running as smooth as possible, and that’s none too smooth.  Ah well.  I wrapped about fifty birthday gifts (we are doing Sophia’s and Erik’s birthday tonight, cake and gifts and what not.).  Oh, and I sliced my finger open (cutting an orange for my lunch, yeah I'm smooth) .  Then I went swimming, and the chlorine burned it.  Fun.  Oh, and I got all my finances in order, bank deposits, and checks for dad to invest.  My checkbook is balanced.  Sweet action.    Tiff called and told me there’s a drama meeting tomorrow night in the coffee shop, but I can’t make it.  *cough*  I have other things going on.  Then apparently when I was in the shower Andrea called, and we have a practice on Thursday at six, oy, I hope can make it.  Stress.  I also hope they aren’t planning another sucky drama, the last two were killer…but you never know.
