Sakuno, a young girl invited to visit her grandmother at the tennis gardens, is riding on the subway when a loudmouthed braggart decides to show off his tennis moves in the car, nearly striking Sakuno's face with his racket.  A boy sitting across from her tells the guy to shut up and says that the man has his grips all wrong.  Afterwards, at the subway station, Sakuno is waiting for her grandmother to pick her up when the boy approaches her again.  He asks her for the directions to the tennis gardens that she is going to.  Unknowingly, she gives him the wrong directions.  Just as he walks past her, she notices that on his tennis racket bag, his name is printed clearly on it.  His name is Echizen Ryoma.  Later, at the tennis gardens, Sakuno realizes that she made a mistake in the directions she gave him, making Ryoma late and disqualified at the tournament he was going to.  She apologizes as soon as she sees him but they are interrupted when the same loudmouthed braggart from the subway (Sasabe) tries to hit Ryoma with his can of pop.  Annoyed at being lectured publicly in the subway, Sasabe decides to challenge Ryoma to a match, positive that he can beat the twelve-year old and embarrass him.  Ryoma beats Sasabe easily even though he was struck in the face with Sasabe's racket (which he threw out of rage when he was about to lose).  Sakuno's grandmother reveals that Ryoma is actually a tennis prodigy from America who has won five consecutive titles and won all the tournaments he's been in.  He is known as the Prince of Tennis.  Thus begins the adventures of Ryoma and the different matches he must face in order to be the best of the best.  He joins his school team, Seigaku, and meets new friends.  Faithfully, they stick side by side and fight to win a place in the All-Japan tournament.  This is by far my most favorite anime.  Don't think that it sucks just because it's all about a sport.  It's really good.  It has a comedic and serious side too.  I think this anime has the best music ever too.  The characters are all very interesting and very different, making you feel like you can bond with any one of them.  I suggest you watch this anime if you want a break from all those fantasy adventure and magic type of anime.  Stay tuned for Nikki's review of all the characters.
