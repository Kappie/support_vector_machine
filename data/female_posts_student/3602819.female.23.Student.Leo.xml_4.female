When I walked into class, it was tense as usual for the reasons of final exams. Then in came the teacher... With some papers that we had done as part of a group project (pairs of students actually). She tossed the papers on the desk and told the class how bad the projects were (my words, not hers... I'm making it nicer than it actually was). Now here is the reason for the big hoop-lah... She said we did not finish the assignment because we left blanks on the papers. (Hee Hee... This is where it gets funny). This is the clinical basis for medical assisting... So it's taking the medical history, family history, vitals and so on. When we were given the assignment, we were told not to write anything that were not in the guidelines for the project. Her reasons: we wouldn't make up any information or sign the patients name, so why do it in the assignment. Guess what?!?! (oh this is great!) the ENTIRE class who didn't write it, or forge the signature, got marked off because of it... Yup... I LOVE IT! so anyway... That's by beef for tonight. At times it makes me really want to yell, scream and carry on for people going back on their word. But then (once again) I'm reminded that I do that SO often. God is constantly teaching me about my flaws. The verse of the day that really hit home... It's the one about removing the log from my eye before I remove the speck of dust from another's...  well... I'm out. As my greatly missed roommate would say... Peace in the Middle-East~ MellieL
