I wont have the chance to hang out with him for a few weeks. Maybe we can do something after school one day this week. But...unfortunately, I have jazz Tuesday and Wednesday.   Oh well, I'll try to think of something. I think I'm going to go try to sleep now. I'm still really tired, and I'm still not feeling that great.
