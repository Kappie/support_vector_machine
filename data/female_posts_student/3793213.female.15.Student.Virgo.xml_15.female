So when my dad says no he's a pot head I just turn red and try to argue my intellegence over it. My dad hates him. HATES him. I tell daddy it's not like he's the first, or worse I've ever dated. He doesn't care. My dad will never respect him until he pulls his act together and the worst thing is, I don't trust him to. I think mine is a lost cause and I'm wasting time on a dream that will never happen. I don't know what to do. I miss him and I want to see him but I know when I'm with him I'm loosing the respect of my father and of my stepmother. How long will it be untill dad tells my mom? Then what will I do, try to salvage and maintain through a phone? I don't think so. It's been four days yet I've already got so many obstacles. Help. I need help and I'm so afraid he is going to disregaurd everything I've tried to make him understand. He and I wont last if he does this. I want it to last, I do! I don't know how I can make the situation better for it is out of my control. I can't control another person, can't make them choose, can't do anything. I hate it.  Kayle  This is only the beginning, of the end that is.
