God warns that Satan's ways may seem appealing and often may even seem to be morally right, but he is like a theif or a con-man who only wants to steal and destroy. Jesus, not Satan, loved people so much that he died for us. Jesus alone offers true peace, love, and joy. And he offers it to everyone.
