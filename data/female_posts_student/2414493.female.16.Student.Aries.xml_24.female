I've already told Zach no and I'm pretty sure that I'll get a "don't get involved with boys" talk once it hits her again, in which case I'll be terrifically annoyed. I don't even remotely like him in that way. It was always his initiative, not mine, and it's always been absolutely harmless. So I think I'll just smile it off, for I know that these talks can be brutal sometimes. Remember that last episode? I seethe inside to even think about it.
