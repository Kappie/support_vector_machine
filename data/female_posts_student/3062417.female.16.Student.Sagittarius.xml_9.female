First of all, my boyfriend of almost a year and a half and I broke up about 2 weeks ago. Second, I am having major family problems (some of you know what I'm talking about). Oh, and I can't forget the fact that my grandma is dieing. I have no date for prom. I have tons of major tests comming up. I am currently failing math with a 61 (??). I try to talk to people and noone understands me anymore. Well, enough of that sad depressing stuff.  On to some happy stuff I guess. Well Carol and I went shopping yesterday and I got a pretty bracelet for prom and a pink skirt (yea u heard me right, kelly in a skirt...well ive changed a lot over the past month and the new kelly wears skirts sometimes) weird huh?. Then we came back to my house and watched Gothika and Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star. Friday night I went with Carol to see Jersey Girl. Yea, I know, it seems like my only friend is Carol doesn't it? Well, sometimes she is the only person that will be there through all this shit I'm going through. And she atleast doesn't say "oh yea i understand what ur going through" like all the other people. Because she knows that she doesn't understand. Noone really truely does. And it kills me to not be able to talk to anyone. I think my mom is the only person I can talk to right now who knows how I'm really feeling. She is so good to me. She talks to me every night as I cry myself to sleep and I love her for that because otherwise I don't know anyone I could talk to. And I don't think I would be able to sleep at night either. As it is, I haven't slept in my own room for about 3 weeks because I've developed a fear of being alone. Yea, that's right, I'm afraid of being alone. Not just like alone in a room, or alone in my own house, but alone as in 'I won't ever love anyone again and will die alone' kind of alone. Someone please help me. I need serious serious help.  Yea, I know, it sounds like I'm all depressed and sucidal and stuff, but I'm not. It's just that it's hard to be happy right now with all this stuff happening. But don't worry about me, I'll get through it, and I'll be the happy Kelly that everyone knows again....someday.  Song: Hoobastank- The Reason ---awesome song...very meaninful to me right now
