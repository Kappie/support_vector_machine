Here's the weird things:  *The lady at Thrift Town points out that both of our totals are $5.06.  *We order a few things at Sonic, but specify no sizes, and they didn't even ask. Our total: $5.06.  *We are driving through my neighborhood and note that all the addresses are 400's, 500's and 600's. But there are no 506's. Anywhere.  *We are at a dead end, so Rachel casually picks a driveway and turns around. I happened to glace down at the mailbox post. It was 605. Read upward: 506.  *We also note that my address is 512. Half of 12 being 6. 506.  Yes yes. Rather interesting little tidbit for you all there.  Well, I'm off. Chase the 506's crazies.
