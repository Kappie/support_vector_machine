I STILL can't find my stupid book that I need to return to the library, and I don't want to get another book until I return that book, but I  have  to get a book on the Olympics otherwise I may not have enough sources for my article. I've been working on it for a little while and now I think that it's going to end up being too long, but we shall see. It is, after all, a features article  and  it  is  the history of the Olympics, and there's an awful lot of info on the Olympics. Maybe I should start some more research on that other article I have to write, the one about   urlLink  www.workintexas.com    That one will be kind of boring, just informational and what not. I cleaned my room a little bit today and now it's not as bad as before, but it's still pretty bad. Lauren is also still not answering her damn phone, and I need that freakin' book because I believe that I left it at her house. OMG, I just saw that new "Amish in the City" show and it's pretty good. It's interesting how different and yet similar the Amish are and the way the people act around them at first. The people were actually quite rude. I'm also looking forward to seeing "America's Next Top Model." I like that show because it gives you a chance to see how truly hard it is to be a model and what they have to go through to become one. Also, you get to see that the girls are real people and aren't all a bunch of anorexic wimps who cry over the smallest things. Well, every once in a while there'll be an annoying chick like that. But most of the time the winners truly deserve it. So yeah... that's some of the TV that UPN is good for, aside from Frasier, Just Shoot Me, and Dharma & Greg. Time for another Fudge Round! Wheee! Thank you Little Debbie!
