My skirt's too short and I dont like wearing it anymore so I got a new dress. After the mall, I went to Bills house. I had a great time there, and...we had great sex. We also cuddled for a long time, and I fell asleep in his arms which was the highlight of my day. hehe...I love my Booskie.  This morning I was feeling lonely. I guess that's what I get for not having friends. -Obviously- So anyhow, Ashley asked me if I wanted to do anything with her Saturday. A smile ~mysteriously~ crept onto my face. Of coarse I said yes, Jesus..I'd be stupid if I didnt. Anyhow, so Im supposed to go to her house. I dont know if she wants me to stay over night though..who knows. I'm waiting for her to get back on so that I can talk to her about it.  Update: Mom is thinking about letting me have an iguana, since I've been responsible about them. She explained to me that the iguana is going to get up to 6 feet long, and she thinks the cage will be too big. I told her that it wont, and that my daddy can just make one. She said "Talk to your father about that", so..there's a chance.  I have super powers. :) I let Ashley have my flying power for a little bit, she was flying around her room and, I turned her into poop. :), So she's a flying piece of shit now :) ..hehe. But, then she saved me from her flying elephants, so I turned her back into Ashley.   Anyhow..Im going to go to bed now.   ~As I lay me down to sleep, I see no god..I only weep and if I die before I wake, PLEASE just know that god's a fake!~
