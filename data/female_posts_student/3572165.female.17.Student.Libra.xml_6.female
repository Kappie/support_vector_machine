I'm so excited, this day is going to go soooo slowly, even though i have lots and lots of things to do before i have to be at the airport at 4:45. such as:  pack   (hehe), go to the grocery store to pick up some cool American foods/candy for the MET girls there, take michelle to a friends house, make chocolate chip cookies for the plane ride...ahh i can't sit still!! in less than 10 hours i will be seated on a plane, headed for Toronto, and then scotland. :-P The Lord is so good! it is absolutely unbelievable to me that all the money we needed to go on this trip - and more - was provided by our congregation and parents. the only fundraisers we did were 2 babysitting nights for the church. i am so blessed to be in the church that i am. looking at those people who eagerly poured out their love and prayers to us these past months - and in the past years! - it is so easy to see that we serve a God who is full of lovingkindess and grace. "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind had conceived what God has prepared for those who love him" I Corinthians 2:9.  i'm going to try and get on the internet at the church often, and instead of emailing, i'll just post on my blog what's been going on...!!!
