However, we saw the  Lion King  in the air conditioned building...thank God...and that absolutely  ROCKED ! Then after all the girls were completely worn out, we went to a restaurant for dinner.  It was inside this  HUGE  hotel/resort thing where all the waitors and waitresses were super loud and kinda strange...but it was soooooo fun!  I asked the waitor for a green crayon, because we had none and he yelled to the entire restaurant to bring green crayons to me and my table! I couldn't stop laughing! So then, after asking him for nearly every color I started to draw on the menu which was just a piece of paper...Apparently, that menu was very near and dear to him however, because he told the entire restaurant that I was drawing on it, and if I continued to do so..he would "punish" me...so...what do you think I did? I drew some more...He was like..."I'll be right back" and he went to the back, coming out with a wooden horse.  He told me I had to ride around the lobby on the horse screaming "I will not damage private property!" I thought it was the funniest thing I ever heard so I went and had a blast skipping around the huge  huge   enormous  lobby screaming at the top of my lungs. I was laughing so hard when I got back! Then, later on, my friend and I asked for more water to drink and our waitress brought back literally a two gallon bucket! she put in huge blue straws and me and my friend just laughed histerically. The waiter guy who made me run around also got something for my friend Michelle...and he told her that she owed him...so on the way out of the restaurant, she said..."Do I still owe you?" and he was like "yeah" so she kissed him on the cheek! it was  THE  funniest and best restaurant experience I've ever  EVER  had! yeah, so here I am writing to you, telling you about my day...I would love to read about yours! write to me! Bye!
