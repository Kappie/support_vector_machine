Many people often say that it's better to experience the former... I used to think so too. However, sometimes I think that I may experience the latter in a relationship. I guess when one is in a relationship, alot of time and effort is needed to maintain it. But when do you ever know that you are ready for it? How do you know that he is the right one for you? Are you willing to give the other party a chance? Is it a risk in the first place? Or if you really like someone, are you brave enough to make the first move? I guess these all some common questions that lots of us who are less experienced ponder on.      Personally I feel that feelings is such an ambiguous thing. It's subjective thus there's no definite defination to it. It's something difficult to juggle at times... However I think that feelings will live with us throughout our life, so it's something we cannot escape from. It can be something that we live for too.      Sounds scary yah? But I think it's quite true. All these emotions and feelings will help to mould one's character... which makes up the most of us. "Feelings" is so powerful that we are controlled by it unknowingly at times. So should learn to control it well.     Anyway, I  have been experiencing lots of mood swings. Alot of things puzzles me at times. And words can't express it all...     Whatever it is... troubles and unanswered qns will always linger around... so perhaps it's a normal thing. Guess no one is trouble-free right? hee~   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Had CO performance on Friday night!!! hehe~ what a roaring success it was. Oh yah~ I received a rose from my senior! so sweet~ it's definitely a pleasant surprise! haha... thanks for all the support [=*_*=]    I felt quite nervous on stage initially. But what deterioriated it was the freezing cold surrounding. Gosh~ I could feel it penetrating into me like a thousand needles... giving me 'frost bites' everywhere. haha~ okay okay that's a little exaggerated. But still, my teeth was already chattering badly. haha...     Yup... what a wonderful day. However the sad thing is that shi jie will be leaving co then. I'll definitly miss her presence! But I believe that will still be lots of time for us to congregate again. We have our whole life! so no worries... all the best in whatever you do! Must take care...      Yesh! Friends are very important to me... especially those close ones.(u know who you are... =P) yeah... although I don't say it often, but still... You guys are very VERY important to me k!!! *shouts* haha... will treasure you all!
