I tried to change the template on my site so people could comment on my posts (still trying to figure it out) and when I saved the changes what I had done, it was all messed up and all my entries were deleted and I almost had a heart attack. This is my SOUL, man. So I went back and retraced what I did and I'm not sure what I did wrong but it was very very wrong. I fixed it. Obviously.         Today there was no school. Didn't feel like it though. Cause by the time Charlotte came over to hang it was past 2 anyway. I guess I got to sleep more but still. We watched the second Matrix movie (bad) but Charlotte had to see it before she sees the 3rd one for her birthday (turning 17 and seeing a rated R movie in the theatre with her other legal friends.) Damn. I still have 3 months. Oh well. I saw the third one (with Dad.... god that's lame...) on Sunday. It was okay but pretty gory. My favorite guy saved the day. Well part of it. I really really liked the "16" year old kid who opened the gate. He was my favorite. I said that. He was so sweet. Wow I need a boyfriend.        I always sabotage any relationship I've ever had. Because I always find something that annoys me about the guy and dwell on it. And how he's not that perfect guy I have built up in my head... and I always listen to what my friends say. Hmm... well okay those who know who all I'm talking about maybe it's good i listened to you (though not quite in time) because none were ever even close to anything I want in a guy.... woah..... hold the phone.... they're ALL like, EVERYTHING I don't like... how did that happen? I think I lower my standards when there's possibility. Shit! It's true! Oh my god. What is wrong with me. And I look past all the things that would make me not like them because I don't want to sabotage this possibility. And then as soon as I 'have' them I realize these things and immediately dislike them. As I should have in the beginning because they're all wrong for me. Did that make sense...?      The only one guy who ever made me feel like I, Natalie, truly meant something to him as a person, graduated and moved away, before I could really tell him so.       A lot of guys are very frustrating because they don't care WHO their girlfriend is, they just want a girlfriend.        It's so incredibly hurtful and insulting and it's happened too many times.  I want someone who wants me to be his girlfriend because it's Me, Natalie. Not breasts and a cute face.         It's some comfort, I guess, that because of this, these certain guys rarely actually do get girlfriends, because even if a girl likes them, the girl realizes that he doesn't like her, he's just like that to everybody, so she disregards it. That's what I do anyway. I just immediately stop caring. A warning to all such boys (not guys, boys). Why bother with such fickle people?         My relationships with other people are the most important things to me. I just need to find someone else who's the same way.   lol... and someone who's hilarious, fun, smart, and musical, and sexy, and sweet... (this shouldn't be hard, right?) ******* I'd be very honored and surprised for anyone who read this far.. I just realized how long this is. I really don't mean to go on and on like I do when I write, it's just that I type so fast and I have so much I want to say that I kind of run away with my thoughts. Treat yourself to a cookie if you just read all that... and this for that matter. Thanks for caring about me enough to read all that shit that I just spouted off. You're awesome and I love you!
