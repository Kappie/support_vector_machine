(Did u like the Janice impression there??!!)i watched the video of it that i recorded last night, this morning and had a little cry :( my mum and sister were laffing at me, they do not realise the sentamental value that it has, Anna and i have discussed it and decided that life will never be the same again.  On an even more depressing note, Big Brother is back aaaaghhhh, find a rock and hide! Im waiting to try and find this evilness quiz but its taking forever! Grrr OOO here we go...., or not!! ....... Have given up, im obviously just too nice.  Such a shame!! xx
