I woke up, many times, odd for me, and once at three am got a glass of water.  I was hot and dry, maybe fevered?  But when in the dream I had said to a companion, "This is another reality, isn't it?  Just as real?"  And they had nodded, and when I woke that truth stuck with me, that knowing that I had been elsewhere, but now, was again shifted.  I didn't really want to leave that sleep, where I felt like I was pushing my knowledge to the edge of what words cover, which is the edge itself if you can hear that.  But this reality pushed in, and I lost the memories of all my nighttime revelations, like when the moments of clarity come while stoned or drunk, and you know they will be lost, not because it is the drug giving you the clarity, but because the drug and the sensations around you and the fog that will form around you will all be part of the formula, and that you wont get it back.  At least each time that clarity comes, it is new.  I woke up and read a book that is equating magick (though the author spells it magic, which is a silly mistake, since he is talking about true reality mind bending shifting truth, and not the parlor bunny in the hat tricks) with words, language, literacy and "the composing imagination."  So far, its fascinating.  The way that people viewed and view the power of words, how the power has been known, how magick and rhetoric come up when ever there is a serious paradigm shift.  Fascinating I think.  Phanatasy is the moments before our mind translates the physical reality in to a series of words, it is the pure flexible before the clean and tight ordered reality of words.  Fascinating.  I like that I am reading this, because we are in a shift.  A wrinkle in the story line, leading into something I would say.  Maybe that's just wishful thinking.  So that was another shift, this shift, in magick and words, that was coming into the morning.  Scholars and Magus long ago said that knowledge was always shifting sand, that to know a thing was not to know its binary (as Derrida would have us think) but to know its likenesses.  But these go on and on, in a detailed web that is always shifting at the same time that it is forming.  Shifting sand that is knowledge, and we can call on the stars, but not on other things with voices with words, because they are dangerous.  Words are dangerous.  I learned that to become an expert, the average amount of time you must spend time doing something is about 20-30 years.  this is to be truely fluent, and then to make dramatic change.  I plan to continue the study of words, and thier dangerous powers, and magick, and we'll see where it all ends up...
