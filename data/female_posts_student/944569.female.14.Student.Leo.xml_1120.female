Yup, i get it now Dana but you would have laughed if i had told you a dream like that except that the other person was different.  anyhow...I reinstalled my camera on my new comp check it out...    believe it or not, it's me.  I decided to mess around with the effects to make it seem like a portrait.  A more or less failed but nice attempt if you ask me.  As you can see, I'm still in my uniform.  Yes, well that's because i'm too lazy to change. Now you know what a lazy slob i am as well as a slacker and diagnosed with a severe case of procrastination. Ps.  My bro's hiding behind my head.  youcan see his big head sticking out if you look carefully.
