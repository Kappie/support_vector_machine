It sounded really bitchy and pissed me off.  it was the continuing thing of you treating me like shit, ordering me about as if you were above me  then, at the concert, you were incredibly rude to me.  during a break i was finally getting to talk to kasso- basically the only person i could talk to during the entire thing- and you decide that you're more important and want to kick me out of my seat.  you could at least be polite and recognize that i'm stuck at the end and it would be cool to let me enjoy myself- after all i fuckin drove you.  but no, you come back from the bathroom and get all bitchy over it.  then you have to grab me and tell me to move.  i say no and then you say condesendingly, "no you don't understand" and throw me to the side.  why did you talk to me like a six year old? you made me look like an idiot in front of a bunch of people.  that was way out of line.  when i called you a bitch there, i meant it.  i havne' t sincerely called anyone a bitch in a long long time.  you deserved it.  stop treating me like i'm nothing, like i'm an underclassa nd don't deserve anything.  a friend would not have been such a bitch about the seating and at least thought about someone else's well being.  maybe i paid the same price as you for the concert nad wanted to enjoy it to? would sitting one seat over ruin it for you? probably not. you could still talk to maggie and shout over to kasso or had me say something.  shoving me off to the end of the row again was really inconsiderate.  it's extremely mean to do something like that to someone who wouldn't dream of hurting you- in a sly comment, insult, or joke.  all of those times you've said something rude/mean to me, i've kept my mouth shut.  i never insult something you do or say.  i treat you like a friend- i always say good things about you to other people.  you certainly don't treat me like a friend.  don't expect to be treated like one anymore- i've had it.  so yea- thats my diatribe online here... that laura's a fuckin bitch.  i wanted to keep silent about it, especially on friday cause i didn't want to upset anyone elses night, but that won't solve anything.  hope you guys understand that i don't like being treated like shit...
