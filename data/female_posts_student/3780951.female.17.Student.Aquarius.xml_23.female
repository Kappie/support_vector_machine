I mean, life has just been great. I wake up every morning excitied and ready to go school, come home and do whatever!! I mean, i love my church, my friends, my family and im just so incredibly blessed. I dont have to be at school till 10:00am. But if I wake up at 7:40am (like i did this morning) I just get up, I mean I try to go back to sleep I just can't because I know something good is in store for the day!  Okay, sorry for going off like that!!! WOW, but anyway, I gotta go do homework before I go to school. I love this late arrival stuff!  Love ya...
