Where we fear an unseen enemy      More than an Auschwitz; Where we risk war to know an adversary      Rather than to know ourselves. When the world drowns in veils and masks      And runs from the vigilante unmasker: 		The philosopher.  		The writer. 		The dreamer.     We murder them,  The ones who doubt the rules of right and wrong Set so assured in blood-spattered stone.      And we murder them: 		The artist. 		The lover. 		The questioning child.   To honor every achievement, To applaud every kind act, To love the face beneath the façade.  And when the child questions     Why we have separate countries,         Why we have boundries,             Why we wage war,               When after all, Aren’t we all humans? 	...and what is it to be human?     The lesson is not to listen, But to hear. The hearts of the untainted are as ingenuous  As they are naïve.  If one voice doesn’t rise up Against the raging flow of society There will be no one to patch up our wounds, Everyone is available But no one does a damn thing. Between morality and self-preservation, 	Take the higher moral ground.
