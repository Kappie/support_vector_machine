Panera for lunch, then I had to work at 4.  UGGGHH. I hate work but it doesn't do me any good to bitch about it because I'll never actually get up enough guts to do anything about it. So...  Tonight after work I went to CM's and he gave me a 6 months anniversary present. It's gorgeous. Too gorgeous almost. I can't believe he actually gave it to me. It's a ring and I love it.  I love that no matter what my day is like, or night for that matter (as was the case with work tonight) if I end it by spending time with CM, all that other stuff doesn't seem to matter anymore.  You think that's what they call love?!? =)  Tomorrow is going to be pretty blah!  I have GOT to do laundry and Christian said he'd come over and hang out with me while I did it.  I was thinking about it tonight at work. A year ago this exact same time, the exact DAY to be exact, Austin broke up with me. And I thought that my entire world was ending. And in only a year, I've completely gotten over him, and completely changed the way I think about things...myself for one. It's just strange how we get so used to the way one person makes us feel (or think) and then when it's all said and done and we're forced to think (and feel) for ourselves, it's really nothing like who we were when we were with the other person.  I think thats probably the greatest thing about CM. He doesn't make me feel like I have to think the way he does, or act the way he does, or do the things he does. I can just be me, the person that thinks and feels for myself, and he loves me anyways.  That is a great note to end on.  Till next time...  *whitney*
