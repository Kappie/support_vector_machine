The stem where the flowers unfolded looks like a pomegant hush when the seeds are gone.  An empty pleasure.  I don't know how my paper whites are doing, the water looks like a primordial soup.  Hopfully they will bloom, and grow.  Hopfully we all will.  Its scary sometimes, when I think about all the things that I distance myself from to function, to keep moving. I am thinking about women, sisters, still out there getting hurt.  I am thinking about war.  I am thinking about friends, and people I will never know, at war.  I am thinking about quiet that's too strong, that you have to scream and scream and it still holds on.  I don't know if I am even screaming out loud.  I am also thinking about pomegranat flowers, and the weird plant my mother gave me that sprouts babies and new branches from the tips of its ruffled leaves.  I am thinking about context, mine, and the story I'm living.  How would we read that text?  How do I read it.  Quiet and peaceful, rich and healthy in a country that is quiet and green.  When there are snipits of news in that story, when there is an undertone of darkness our main character doesn't have to face, and when there are floating bits of mythology and magick, what does the reader make of it?  Am I the author?  What should our main character do?  Should she drop everything and run off on a quest?  But the story has so many twists and turns, nothing is that simple.  The reader knows that.    Its cold out tonight.  My fingers are just warming up after being outside.  They still have that haunted cold fog laying around them.    My whole body really has that cold floating feeling.  Tingling surreal freezing fuzz.  Masterfully crafted outsideness.  And this text, this abbreviated version of what is, why is it?  Why am I writing, and to whom?  Not just here, but in my journal too.  I have always had someone listening to these long rambles, someone wondering what will happen next, waiting with bated breath.  There could be many listeners right now, and there could be none.    Like writing on slips of paper, folding them into perfectly crafted boats and letting them float downstream.  Maybe every one of them goes under, to be read by nothing but sand and time, or maybe everyone of them gets caught in a reedy net.  They float and swirl in the current, turn three bends that are both wide and fast, and then edge to the left hand bank.  There the water pushes them gently into an eddie, and the twist and dance, just as the bottom of the paper is beginning to soak in wet.  They land like ocean liners on a tiny beach, boulders of pebbles and cliffs of sand.  Someone collects them there.  Unfolds them carefully and sets them on an old off white kitchen towel in the corner of the mud room to dry.  When there is no trace of damp on them, and only then, they read them.  All these paper thoughts sent out, and when the paper drys this person sits on a purple chair that is faded on one side.  The chair is heavily stuffed with old cotton batting that leaks out of a dog chewed corner.  Rabbit soft evening light falls through the windows smudged with dog nose prints and finger swirls.  They sit in that chair, like putting on old jeans or a flannel shirt, and they read my thoughts.
