I had a telephone interview yesterday with an Admissions Representative from Brown College, because I am trying to get into Culinary School. She told me she is going to recommend me for admission! I am SOOOOOOOOO excited. This will require me and my family to move down to the Twin Cities area, but that is okay, because i will be closer to my little sister, and I think she needs someone closer to her geographically. It is not easy to get into Brown College, you need to be recommended for admission, and that is why I am so happy and excited. You see, I LOVE to cook. It is one of my passions. I am happiest when I am building a menu and shopping for ingredients, then creating the whole meal with my hands and my heart. I just have to hope that my financial aid comes through and that I will be able to afford to go. ................ My little sister has started a blog. I am so proud of her. I know it seems silly to be proud of someone for doing one of these, but I really am. She buries emotions and feelings and pain and guilt and all the things that could trip her up when she is feeling strongly about something, and I think the blog is going to help her begin to express herself much more strongly. --------------- I am feeling really off today. Not off like mentally, but just very tired and sluggish. I hate feeling like this. I know it is from lack of sleep, but still...I feel like crawling back into bed and hiding under the covers. Unfortunately I cannot do that. I have things to do, places to go, people to see, bills to pay, yadda yadda yadda. I am going to go make a pot of coffee and will be right back...don't go anywhere...I am waiting for a phone call from the Head of the Culinary School, because I have to have a mini-interview with him as well, just to go over things. Then I have to go do laundry and some other stuff. Never enough time in the day for everything I need time to do....
