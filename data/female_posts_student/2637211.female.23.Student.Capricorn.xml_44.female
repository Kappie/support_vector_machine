I'm also meeting with the study group this afternoon, and I have no idea what I'll do. I guess I should go to the library and see if it's on reserve, and spend the rest of the day reading. That sounds so logical. I guess I should go do that. I think I'll make myself some lunch first, and then head back out.   BTW, I really am hating this bicycling in winter thing... I am freezing on my bike, then the moment I step into the building I am suddenly overwhelmingly hot. I end up peeling down to my t-shirt, and with my current layering technique, that's a lot of peeling! Oh well, it beats being entirely cold all winter, right?
