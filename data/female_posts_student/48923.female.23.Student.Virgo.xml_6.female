The show is called  In Defense of Sin (My Friends' Best Stories) , and we hear it is just that...Matthew Foster was gathering stories at parties with other theatre kids, so maybe we'll hear some we know (we are hoping for the one about the dead cat)!  Five shows, five nights...can we make it to all of them?  You bet we can!
