Anyway Johnny Depp looked frikkin hot with this one hat on, and he was like behind a door and everything said Shooter and then he like swung the door and it said Shoot Her..so ya that was pretty cool.   Anyway, here I'll tell the story. Me and Francesca were looking out the bus window and all the other kids were walking to their buses and this kid looks up at out window, looks at francesca and says '5 dollars'....well we started laughing a bit and i yelled out 'Giver her 10 and she'll do tricks' and he heard me!!! so he looked back and walked off and francesca was like 'im gonna kill you'....she keeps her promises lol, it was uber funny though. And, whatever happend to that kid?hmmmmm, oh well.  Ok well im bored cuz its 11, i havent been able to sleep lately, i hate it when you want to sleep but all you do is think about things, ugh and like, the slightest noises or whatever will wake me up. grrr. Oh well.   Ok bands- I like that song 'take me out' by Franz Ferdinand, and i like that song by Muse, and we listend to Rooney so i know i like them. I looked up the band Bad Religion and they seem good. hmmmmmmm....
