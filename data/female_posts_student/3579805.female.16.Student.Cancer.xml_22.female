I really hope he's someplace better beause those poor boys have to grow up without their daddy just like i have to and i dont wish that on anyone. Today was he funeral i tried so hard not to breakdown. Almost as soon as i walked into the church i saw Cam and he opened his arms for me to give him a hug i almost lost it. I gave him a hug and a kiss. Hes just so sweet and poor killian just doesnt quite comrehend whats happening not fully anyway hes too young. Anthony is being so strong. I think he feels like he has to take care of everybody. I wish i could do something for him. Steven (chelseas brother) is taking this really hard, he and i talked for about 30 minutes on friday. We had a lot to talk about since we havent had a chance to do that since he moved back to ohio. He turned out to be a pretty cool guy. Im gad he doesnt wish to torture me anymore. Just chelsea. Oh cheese and rice the dumbest thing ever happened at the funeral home. The phone rang and ashley goes "my ear is ringing" i looked at her and said....thats the phone idiot. She swears her ear was really ringing. lol I hope chelsea calls me back pretty soon. Well i havent seen shane in a couple days lol. Im having skateboarder withdrawls. Somehow i think i'll survive. Hes so damn cute but hes using me which im well aware of. I need to find a guy my own age who wants the same things i do. Im tired of feeling like nobody gives a shit.Im tired of danielle constantly talking about oey and me just having to smile and nod. I know shes not trying to sound like a conceitd self centered little bitch, but she does. I know theyve been dating a long time but she as no right to look down on me for kissing shane. She goes "YOURE NOT EVEN DATING HIM" who the fuck cares its not like im having his baby. Jeez! Thats a mouthfull from someone who can forgive someone for having sex with a man whore. Why cant she cut me some sack its not like my life is as magically wonderful as hers. I dont know what sh wants from me but this isnt her life and its not her decision. We do share a lot of the same morals but i guess astinence from pre-datig kissing isnt one of them. I cant believe im even saying this its just rediculous that she has a problem with it.Who gives a damn, not me, well obviously i do but im over it im tired of worrying about what danielle. Well im gonna go wath a movie.....
