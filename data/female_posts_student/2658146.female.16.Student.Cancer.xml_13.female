I talked to Boots after school, and even though she hasn't known them as long as some of the other guys, she too agreed. I want to strangle Dave. Yet for some reason I can't find it in my heart to leave him. We have some good things going for us, but now I'm getting mushy so I'll shutup.  Two boys (and I emphasize the word "boys") jumped out of the second story window of the A Building at school today during my last block. The window had broken so they decided to defy the teacher when she told them to not jump. Ah, ignorance must be bliss...  Except it's not. Don't even get me started on that, ugh.  Also, there was a snake on a desk in first block. Everyone was scared. I would've taken it outside myself since it was only a garter snake, but Mr. Davis had already been called to come get it. He walked in, casually grabbed the snake, chatted with Mr. Branson (my driver's ed teacher), and walked out. No one knows what happened to the snake. Well, not me anyway.
