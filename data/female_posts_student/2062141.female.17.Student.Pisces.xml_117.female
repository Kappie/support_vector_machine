In My Life (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: John Lennon  There are places I remember All my life though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all  But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  In my life I love you more
