(mc dinner)". she is one of the only people where we'd look at something, and we'd look at each other and be thinking the exact same thing. it's kinda creepy. that, or something would happen, and we'd say the exact same thing at the exact same time. like, the other day, we were at the dollar store, and she saw this obeasty necklace with a cowboy boot on it.   linz: hoh...look at this. me: ...these boots were made for walkin'? linz: get out of my head.   yeah...officially one more hour of school left! i've probably said this already but still! wheee. can't wait for summer. go to some shows, get a job, and hang out with people. yeahh and go on stupid vacation with my stupid family. gaah.  so then today i went shopping for linz (i postponed it to go to a different store that wasn't staples) and got her...well, i can't say it here because i know she's reading this. i know this because she's on the phone with me telling me to hurry up and finish blogging in between her singing.  buut yeah lindsay's being an idiot on msn and i forgot anything i was going to say...probably not all that much anyway..but yeah...later days.  -joebie
