(i know...you must be asking what the...?) he had to go home and get stuff and stuff! *laughs*  the next thing i knew, my phone rang and it was my favourite person in the world!! he was annoyed that i didn't hear him knocking at the door... like hello! the door's downstairs and you're talking to someone who was sleeping like she hadn't slept in a 20 years!  groggily, i tumbled downstairs to open the door and there he stood with a huge bunch of all sorts of yellow flowers wrapped in pink and green paper! what more could a girl ask for? *smiles* what a sweetheart... he also made me a gorgeous pair of earrings... in yellow and black! *dreamy sigh* oh he also booked me in for a massage in the city with his mom who's birthday falls on the SAME DAY as me!  we headed to dragon boat to have yum cha with kelvin, nic and tim tam... it was pretty yum! oh! kelvin gave me this super stylish esprit bag... he did he know? i've been looking for a nice black leather bag since i got back to melb! and nic gave me this beautiful pearl bracelet... it looks so pricey! tsk! nic ah... you ah... really know how to choose gifts!  after yum cha, my baby dropped me off at the massage place. a much needed massage right hon? after you stress me out day after day? *laughs* just pulling your leg babe... i love you and NO you don't stress me out... much! the massage took an hour and right after that, we had to have an early dinner with his family! can you imagine? yum cha ended at 3.45 and dinner was at 5.30! i felt like a suckling piglet being prepared for the roast!  after dinner, we picked up fab an esther from chinatown and headed back to my place for drinks and some foosball! *laughs* then it was off to STRIKE! We bowled 1 game and played pool most of the time... that place had a lack of balls! i mean bowling balls and not testicular fortitude! *grins* yeah yeah... dave and his friends (dougie and john travolta/wop sing) came down to join us. dave's sucha riot... he's sucha ladies man! seriously!   and nope, my night doesn't end there... after bowling, we headed to hungry jack's for some sustenance! so yum... oh, esther made me a pair of earrings too! that girl is so sweet! you could just put her on a stick and call her lolly!  aside from the fact that my mom's not here, the could possibly be the best birthday ever! yeah yeah... my 21st was at some fancy schmancy place but i really don't know why this simple birthday just really made me incredibly happy. i really don't need expensive gifts to make me happy... just the company of good people and the person i love.
