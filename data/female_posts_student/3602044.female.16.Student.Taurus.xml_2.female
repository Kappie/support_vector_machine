Which I think is great because he was one of the greatest people of our time.  When Someone who will remain namless came into the room and preceeded to be very rude and impatient about going out and flushing irrigation pipe.  Now here's my thought:  It's raining, cloudy, and generally not the weather to be turning water on anyway, so WHY THE HELL THE BIG RUSH???  And what really pisses me off is that my favorite person was about to give a eulogy and I really wanted to watch it.  So then we go out to the field and my mom and I are checking gates and doing some other stuff and he is there being a total dick the whole time, telling her what to do and that everything she does is wrong, so then it really really made me angry.  So I said Fuck It! I won't even give him the satisfaction of pissin me off, I'll just ignore him, and let me tell you what, it's working.  So this rambling is to the one who pisses me off the most often and with great success evertime.  So here's to him, at least I had something to write about.
