I have no idea what to do - I'm just really confused right now I don't know what I should do.  I don't know if I should drop any courses or what...I just don't know.  I am starting to have some feelings that maybe I don't want to teach science, but it's confusing because that is my dream and I didn't even imagine giving up on it.  And I guess me and chels sorta had like a little fight today about stuff I mean we are going through so much right both and usually we support each other but lately there's been no one there and well I have to admit it's hard because I sit and cry for about half and hour each night.  She's always complaining about her problems and so am I but she gets mad everytime I complain yet she does the same thing.  Sometimes I have bad thoughts like suicide but I don't think I could ruin all my dreams like that, but I am just very confused and plan to talk things over with Chels tommorow.
