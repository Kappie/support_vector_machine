I guess the less I go out the more money I save huh?  I am absolutely shattered today.  I was out last night with some interns from Church, and then worked Friday and Saturday nights...meaning very little sleep for poor Clementine.    I finally am moving out of my house on Friday! WAHOO!!!  I can't wait, I get to live in a tidy house with people I am friends with.  No more listening to folks vomit in sinks next door...no more parties till 6am when I am trying to sleep, and no more disrespectful teenage boys.  I couldn't be more excited.    Unfortunately life isn't all that exciting.  No fun travels or anything else.  I just don't have the funds.  I did however get a new digital camera when I was home so I will try to post more pics when I  have a bit more time.
