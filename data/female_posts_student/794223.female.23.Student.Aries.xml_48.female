Bush outright lied to the American people regarding Iraq's "stockpiles" of WMD's, we need to seriously take a step back and have a look around.  I happen to personally believe that he did indeed mislead the American people, but perhaps not intentionally; I would maintain that the intelligence community mislead him into truly believing that Iraq was an immediate, they-are-going-to-gas-us-tomorrow threat.  (Even though the Secretary of State denied such an immediate threat 7 months before 9-11 ever happened.)  Regardles...this entire situation makes me very, very nervous.  When the CIA, FBI, NSA, or whatever other 'intelligence' gathering agency is actually having the President of the freaking United States as well as the Prime Minister of Britain truly and honestly believing that Saddam Hussein had piles upon piles of weapons of mass destruction, there's a problem.  RED FLAG, RED FLAG.    "National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on Thursday became the first senior member of the Bush administration to acknowledge publicly that the data used as the key argument for invading Iraq may have been wrong."--BBC News  The data used may have been wrong.  Ooops!  We single-handedly alienated the international community, watched as 500+ of our soldiers die, and continue to watch them die, seeing as how remnants of Hussein's regime remain in Iraq and continue to fight, not for their former leader, but for their warped version of Allah.  Oops.  If they had an independent council investigating a President's sex life, then they can sure as hell have an independent council investigating our own intelligence gathering forces--and just whether or not Dubya may have lied.  Not about getting a blow job in the oval office, but about issues of national security.  And that slight chance that our own President may have been using what occured on September 11th in order to justify proactively invading a country.  I'm not saying that he did--I'm just saying that maybe, just maybe, it might be a good idea to look into it.  To take a good, hard look at the capabilities (or lack there of, it would seem) of our intelligence gathering forces.  Let me make something perfectly clear to all those who have raised the "humanitarian" argument regarding the ousting of Saddam.  He is a horrible man, and I'm very happy that he's in custody.  But the War in Iraq was not sold to us on the basis of humanitarian need, though Bush would now say otherwise.  Our President looked right at the camera and assured the American people that we were going into Iraq because Saddam Hussein posed an immediate threat to us, which he did not.  And I'm not buying any of that "oh, but he would have posed a threat to us at some point..." argument.  That's not what he said.  He said that Saddam Hussein had "stockpiles" of weapons of mass destruction (now he admits that perhaps there were only 'programs' in operation) and that he posed an immediate threat.  As in, if we don't get rid of him now, he's going to run over to Bin Laden and purchase a nuclear weapon (which is complete bull shit; if Saddam wanted to buy a nuke, he would go to the Saudis or North Korea to do that).  Furthermore, Bush had the gaul to draw a connection between 9-11 and Hussein, only to rebuke that connection later when he realized there was none.  He flat out made all of the families of the 9-11 victims, not to mention 80% of the American people and all of our boys over in the mid-east, truly believe that the war in Iraq started on September 12th, 2001.  I would love to see democracy spread in Iraq and in neighboring nations.  I am glad that Hussein no longer has rein over the Iraqi people.  But dammit, let's make sure that the next time we decide to invade a country, we have our facts straight.
