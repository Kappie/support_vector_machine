Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing      and why can't I let it go?      Therre's gotta be more to life     than chasing down every temporary high     to satisfy me.     Cuz the more that I'm     trippin' up thinking there must be more to life.     Well it's life, but I'm sure.     There's gotta be more...     than wanting more.       I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly      Here in this moment, I'm halfway out the door.      Onto the next thing, I'm searching      for something that's missing.      Therre's gotta be more to life     than chasing down every temporary high     to satisfy me.     Cuz the more that I'm     trippin' up thinking there must be more to life.     Well it's life, but I'm sure.       There's gotta be more...      I'm wanting more.      I'm always waiting on something other than this.      Why am I feelin' like there's something I missed? - Staccie Orrico-  More To Life    I don't really like the singer or the song but the lyrics are definitely hitting home right about now...
