As for you Brian...i swear, if you touch ANY ONE of my bears, i will make it my goal in life to run you over in my car:D Have a nice day! :P Anyways yeah...i don't know the last time i wrote in this was about two bears i got from mcdonalds...well...those two bears have no grown to a collection of 6 bears! Yes...from the skills of me and Sabz travelling to just about ever mcdonalds in oakville and mississauga we got most of the bears! only 6 more to go!!! *high five sabz* Then...i can't really remembertoo much of what happened.... oh i went to wonderland yesterday....see overall it was fun cause i got to chill with my two best girls:) but it BLEW because of the HORRIBLE guy situation....*sigh* honest to god, from the time we were there at 10:30am (would've been there at 10 if it weren't for the damn trucks blocking my exit for the 400) but from the time we were there at 10:30am till 9:45pm....we only sawa a HANDFUL of hot guys...HOW SAD IS THAT?! but yeah...so the boy situation was totally disapointing...along with the piss ass weather....so fucking cold!!!! good mercy! we didn't even get a chance to go to splash works! how much does that blow?! blah...anyways it was still fun....people had their moments during the day....Sabz got a headache so couldn't go on all the rides...then me and Rach finally got to talk to each other...which we haven't gotten the chance to in a long long time....But yeah so it was nice catching up Ohhhhhhhhhhh memories....flashback! tee hee...watching that GOD DAMN SEXY BLACK GUY dancing about on the machine....*drool* almost as hot as ex-con right rach.....NAH!!!! come on...no one can beat ex-con!!! yes the damn crazy and pathetic DDR people were taking over the machine so me and Sabz couldn't go on it...so we busted the money and went on the Para Para...or as sabz calls it Pala Pala...i dunno she's asian...but yes....made a fool outta myself...didn't think people were watching cause i thought they were watching the DDR ....but yeah...went around in a few circles and waht not...it was quite entertaining! But yeah...oh mercy....i just had the image of that yummy Funnel cake in my head...*drool* Man sabz...i have no idea whats wrong with you....how could you not LOVE funnel cake...she ain't normal raye.....psst its cause she's asian....shhhhhhhh don't tell! but yeah...so i had quite a lotta fun.... DJ...UHHHHHH Anyways yes...as for my guy situation....grrrr....i dunno...Val's getting so many mixed emotions....see....i like Mikey.....a lot....buuuuutttttt i dont' trust him yet... i think i can't trust him is only because i haven't met him yet...like...its hard to explain...it was different with Bren...he didn't trust me...but its not that i don't trust mike...cause he hasn't given me a reason to not trust me...but for me i think its easier for me to trust him if i see him in front of me....and also because of all the things that he says to me is SOOOOOO sweet...well...most of the things lol...but yeah...i dunno....its hard for me to believe that the things that he says to me is true....because he hasn't met me either...and he judges on looks ALOT...so it makes me nervous and iffy cause i don't believe him when he says things to me...cause for all i know he's saying it to the other girls taht he's talking to too...but he says that he doesn't talk to that many girls but i dunno if i believe him...hence the whole trust issue...blah! i dunno....i like him....but should i like him? there is no reason why i shouldn't like him...but the reason why i do like him has many reasons for it...like....he's sweet, gorgrous eyes....sorta considerate, welll i know he is....cute voice, one thing i absoloutly love about him though is that he's soooooooo goal oriented....he knows what to do in life and how to do it...he has his whole life figured out and that impresses me so much....i dunno....starting to like this guy more and more...but i'm trying to stop myself from liking him SOOOOO much...blah...i dunno...i talk to him like EVERYDAY...well the longest time i didn' talk to him was like 3 days...and even then he text messaged me....i dunno...he seems too good to be true almost....and for all i know all the stuff he's saying to me he doesn't mean it at all...i don't always know what he's feeling, thats the down side of it all...he tells me about all these girls that hit on him and that he flirts back, and i dunno...makes me question a lot about him....its weird cause now i'm actually having the feelings of me missing him...wishing that i could hear his voice...hear him talk...i dunno if thats a normal thing...god damn...i'm confizzled...i dunno i think the main reason why i'm so confused is because he isn't very clear on his emotions exactly....like we talk like we're friends which i totally love and i dunno i wish he'd tell me more about himself, then the people that he flirts with and that he thinks is drop dead gorgeous....*shurg*....blah! Okay...other boys!!! Although Mike is my main boy, other boys.....r....my dog is choking....anyways yes...Richard...he is just a toy...lol....nothing special...he's cute....closest to my dream boy....Blond hair, gorgeous blue eyes, cute little new yorker accent sorta thing, got scars....and then some...like he hit on me....i gave him my number....he took me out to demetries....and whatever....but i dunno....nothing too special....the only time i really see him now is when i go back to the automotive place where i met him so his dad can fix my car....but yeah...so he's not too special...just a cutie....like the bad boy type....next boy.... T, my god....hot sexy black guy! damn....he hit on me while i was at summer school....offered me alcohol....told me i had nice legs apparently...and he calls me, and we're going to chill sometime...he's a record producer, so very...uh...P Diddy...so he's sweet....anyways yeah.....i dunno whast gunna happen with that....probably nothing....i don't even feel anything for him anyways...so its all good.. Cicso....i've known him for quite a while now....total cute....la de da....bought my cell phone off of him and he gave me a deal on it...but yeah....we chill occassionally....so its cool.... other boys too lazy to write stuff on ...Mark, Mike M. Anyways yeah...so thats my guy delima right now...and i dunno what i'm goin to do about it...anyways i must leave cause i have to pick up my mother at 5 and i'm still sitting here in my pjs.... so ta ta!!
