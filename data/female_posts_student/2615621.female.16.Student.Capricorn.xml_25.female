UGH It's just life can get so confusing and its like no one fully understands AND THEN LIFE GETS WORSE. im always in freakin 2nd place with my friends.."ooh, ur katie that hot girl's friend" im fucking tired of it. and it gets worse..u tell a guy u like that u actually like them..putting ur heart out on the line, wearing it on ur sleeve...and just when things look good...and ur happy...and ur smiling..he crushes u, i mean..he runs ur heart (and ur sleeve) lol over with a fucking steam roller. WHY?! CUZ HE LIKES UR BEST FRIEND. he likes her, not u. how many times has that happened to me?! too many. I'm tired of being single, im tired of not having a bf there for me or having one to drag along with my friends..it's like im doomed with guys for the rest of my life. IM FREAKIN ALMOST 16!! and the more i say.."it doesnt matter ne more..it doesnt matter ne more.." the more it matters to me. it just gets to me sooo damn much. Like, idk..im almost in tears..its not even funny. What jordan did just hurt so damn much. I guess thats what u get when u put urself out on the line and get run over by steamrollers...lmao if that made ne sense. Sometimes i just feel like im not good enough or not whatever enough, like i'm never going to be good or live up to anything great. I dont know what to do with my life, i have tons of dreams and goals, but they seem just all outta reach. Now, as tears run down my face, and i have to admitt to jordan that he hurt me, and share my feelings and be honest..it hurts..it hurts more, cuz usually i can laugh and people think im ok..but im not ok, i get upset too, i have feelings too...im human too. I want people to freakin understand that. I want someone to tell all of that too, and lauren, ur about the only one who i think i can tell. Not even kaela.. Life sucks ass sometimes...
