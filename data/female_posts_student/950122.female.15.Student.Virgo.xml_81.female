I really need to be more responsible. =/ Oh yeah, does anyone know where I can download the font used on the quiz pic?  ________  I just want to reflect on what happened in Madrid, Spain. 200 people dead, just like that. How do those people live with themselves? I'm so sick of hearing about people killing other people that just  thinking  about it makes me want to vomit. But more than anything, it scares me. And I hate being scared.
