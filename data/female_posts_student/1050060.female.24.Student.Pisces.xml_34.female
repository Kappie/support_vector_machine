I wrote them a nice letter and printed up. I am hoping they will have my loan done by next week.    I have been mad about student loans and its not as bad as Brenda. Brenda found out yesterday that she had to reapply because OSAP made a mistake. The university its helping her get it faster. She is hoping to have it around the same time as me. Anyways i am going to get going. Have a good day!
