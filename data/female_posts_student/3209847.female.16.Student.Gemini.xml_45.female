I'm ALMOST done with Catch 22. After that i'm going to read the Crucible, and while i'm on my european trip, i'm going to read The Grapes Of Wrath. I'm getting really excited about my trip.  Catch 22 is actually a good book. Its hard to get into, but it gets better after a while. I'll post later, I'm going to go call sarah, and then read some more.  *kisses* to sarah, everyone have a great week
