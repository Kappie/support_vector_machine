It was a very,  very  interesting week to say the least... (Go get some snacks now, kids; this may be a bit long!)  So, Saturday/Sunday morning, I didn't bother sleeping since we were leaving at 6am. I started getting ready around 5ish. (Waaaay later than I wanted to since I wanted to be at the Extension Office--where we were leaving from--around 5:30.)  I rushed and rushed and got there around 6. Oops... But no worries, since the bus was going to be about 50 minutes late because he was coming from Hancock (which is  more  than 50 minutes away). So, a lot of people went to McD's or a similar place for breakfast instead of just standing around waiting...  Weeeell, the bus was there in 50 minutes. I think many people were kind of surprised, but just figured that the bus driver must have been past Hancock when he called or something like that...  We loaded into the bus, someone put on  Mulan  and everyone settled in for a long, uneventful bus ride.  Right. Since I didn't get sleep, I fell asleep pretty quickly. Everyone who was awake noticed that the bus was shaking more than it should and it seemed to be tipping around the turns--we had to go through the mountains and even on the interstate the road is still very hilly and curvy. But, everyone just assumed it was their imaginations.  ...Until we got pulled over by a cop. A big, completely loaded (both with people and cargo) carter bus was doing  98 MPH  in a 65 MPH zone.  I didn't know buses could even go that fast. The speedometer stopped at 80, so the needle on it just stopped there...  Crazy shit.   Well, we got to camp. It was great as usual. The  urlLink "Outspoken for 4-H"  bikers rode in to camp along with Representative Capito. Bah, I can't stand that woman.  Also in camp on Sunday night was the first Prince of  urlLink Mali . Pretty cool, huh? I mean, it's  Mali ... But, still royalty... Until he was introduced later in the evening at Council Circle, I just thought he was a new staff member, and it took me a while to notice his accent...   Annnd, I met  urlLink Jesus . The real deal. ...Except he goes by the name of Brad now...   So, moving onto Monday... What interesting happened? Hm...  Oh, at OMC we take a class or two (either two hour-long classes, or a one two-hour long class). I took a two-hour class of Art. Wheee! Fun. I did a somewhat abstract painting of a woman's form with paint splattered all over it and an oddly colored print of hills and evergreen trees. I didn't put details or anything, but I know my mom didn't like it. Heh..  Also, there was a guy in that class, John, who is friggen awesome at charcoal drawings. He did his first charcoal drawing ever during that class. Wow, great stuff. And he did another one of the All Star Rose Garden, and put them both in the silent auction on Thursday night. And I got the second drawing. Yay :)  Tuesday... Hm...  Oh! After class, John and I were walking around, and he said that he was going to audition to MC (emcee?) the Informal Banquet which was on Thursday night. Since, I had nothing else to do I decided to audition also...  Well, we both (along with 5 other people) got call-backs after dinner. There was a position for a guy and girl to MC and positions for the opening a closing thought.  ...Anyway, I got Closing Thought which meant that I got to read a poem in front of 400 people... Wheeee!  Wednesday.... We had a bunch of different health activities in the morning that we could participate in, but could only do three... I choose the do Dance Dance Revolution, and found that I completely suck at it! :) Then I did, Clogging. Oh man, Friggen awesome. I wasn't too good at it, but, man, it was fun! I'd really like to do it more... My last activity was yoga, which I have always loved, and I really need to get some videos so I can do it at home. Mmm, yoga is awesome...  Thursday... Nothing major.... Until word got to Tiffany that her mom, Cindy, had a stroke. :( She of course, went home as soon as she heard. (Since she rode the bus up, Chad drove her home.) This was the first day in nearly a year that I prayed.   ....I read the  urlLink poem  for Closing Thoughts. I have never been more nervous in my life! I've read in church in front of 350 people, but for some reason that was not nearly as bad as reading at OMC... I got a lot of compliments of my reading and the dress that I wore--which was Jessica's because I left in such a rush on Sunday that I forgot the outfit that I wanted to wear...  During the banquet we (the Jefferson county people) found out that Cindy was conscious and that the stroke wasn't nearly as bad as was first thought... Thank God. That was the best news I heard in a long time.  Also, Amy, Scott's (Cindy's son and Tiffany's brother) wife, was induced for labor that day...  Friday... First half of the day was pretty good. John asnd I were about to go and do a charcoal drawing of some thing around the Mill. We were standing around trying to think of the best place to draw went I saw Storme walking towards me crying. So, I go up to her and hug her, trying to figure out what's going on... She tells me that Cindy died that morning.  Ouch. I'm in shock. I've known Cindy for as long as I could remember. She was always so kind. So, so nice and kind. And, oh my God. Mitch, Ryan, Marsha, and Tiffany! God, I feel so sorry for them. And Scott and Amy! Wow. They didn't tell Amy until after she had the baby... Actually, I don't know how long they waited to tell her...  But, shit. It was so sudden, so unexpected.  ....Council Circle was good. Josh Potter--what a cutie! (*sigh* If only I was 13...)--got the Outstanding First-year Camper Award and Sarah Potter got, I think, the Outstanding Female Camper Award. How! How! to the Potters! :)  Saturday... Good day... As good as the last day of a camp can be.. I wasn't  anywhere  in the camp slide show. Argh :\ (Neither was James, so I don't feel  so  bad..) Emma B., Morgan, Patrick, and Sarah Johnson all got chosen to be out of state delagates. How-friggen-How!  Oh, speaking of out-of-state delagates Jonathan from North Carolina... Wow, gorgeous... ;)  And I didn't see John (not to be confused with Jonathan), so I didn't get to say "bye" or get his screen name. :/ And I didn't get Ross's or James's screen names either... *snap*...   Random quotes:  me: "I don't get it..." Ross: "Poking is another term for sex." me: "Oh, I knew that.." Ross: "Ashley, I'm so glad that I can be blunt with you!. . ."    Amy: ". . .But you did say me, right?" me: "No, I said you."     me: "Do you have a pen?" Amy: "No, but I have a needle; you could carve it into your wrist."    Jonathan: "Wait, I'm on the bottom, and you're on top, right?" ...Uh, he was referring to how our arms are supposed to go when dancing....   And seeing that it is Sunday now...   HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY JONATHAN!
