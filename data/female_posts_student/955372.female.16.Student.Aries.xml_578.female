I don't feel like putting all the amazingness in complete sentences, too much. so here is a list of the highlights... 1. waiting in line to buy tickets the 500 year old woman cut in front of us 2. in the movie, well, just wow. It was the worst plot and the worst italian accents i have ever heard. And yet it was amazing and we are officially obsessed with lizzie 3. after the movie we went to the mall in search of lizzie merchandise, we found blonde hair extensions in claires, very tempted to buy. 4. we saw this guy trying to break up with this girl so we ran up the stairs to stare at them, we watched them for like ten minutes and then we turn around for like three seconds and they were gone. psht, just are luck. She probably smacked him too. I bet she cried. i feel so deprived. 5. walked around for a while and then got our pictures taken in one of those photo booths and it says "i love you" across the top and our pictures are in a big heart, amazing. 6. This little kid was standing outside the booth he was like four, we tried to get him to get in the picture with us, but sigh, he didn't 7. while the picture was printing we realized that there was a tv on top of the booth that allowed everyone passing by to see us and our picture that said "i love you" at the top, if people didn't think we were lesbians before that, they do now. we almost pissed ourselves laughing. 8. then we went to cvs to get a marker to add lizzie to the bottom of our picture so it reads "I love you, Lizzie" sadly there was no such marker that was not prepackaged so we could use it without actually purchasing it. 9. we went to this furnature store and pretended to be lesbians picking out new furnature for our apartment to match our new lizzie design. 10. this kid hit me in the back with some like bizzare toy. Madeline seems convinced he was aiming for my ass. Horny ten year old. 11. we chased those two kids they seems rather scared. Especially the fat one. We were going to show them our lesbian picture, but they ran to their parents 12. went to get water ice but then ran away because ed hlosjakhdfkjlhas was there. We passed ritas and i was like "just be casual blend in he won't see us" then i rammed into some random woman. It was funny. 13. then we got ritas and went home. all in all a good day. we must have lost a million callories or more laughing. ah ha.
