I always buy their comics when I have the money (it ranges from $4- $6) And I have quite a lot at home. Mostly Archie's pals and gals comic book. I have to hide it, if not, my father will chop my head before I can say "Let me explain..." At least Archie's pals and gals is worthwhile, you read everybody's stories and interesting way of life. YOU can say I am mad about Archie. They are a break from the reality where there are no such people... But I like Betty, she is so sweet... (0'-'0)    Congratulations, you're like Betty...You are sweet and kind and know what you want, you are mostly full of positive energy. People adore you for your sweet natured self.    urlLink   What Archie Comics Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
