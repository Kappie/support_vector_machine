I just saw a load of people rolling around in the mud with motor-bikes. I just watched this guy on the news. Made me feel really English and made me laugh. Dunno why though. Hehe, how different we all are, made me realise I guess. As far as I get it, English people have boring lives. Well, I do. Boring and cold! We don't eat cream scones with tea. Infact, I hate tea! Oh, Cornwall's a really tacky place, well actually not a lot of it is. The rest is devoted to walkers, some is devoted to surfers, whatevers left is of course devoted to me. ;) Nah, it's got nice gardens and things. Ok, so on Neighbours some one almost died from drinking alcohol!
