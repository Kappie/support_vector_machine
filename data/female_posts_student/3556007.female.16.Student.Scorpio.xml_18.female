(I am going to live to be 81, Ellen is going to live to be 89, I am going to have 4 kids: 1 girl, 1 boy, then 2 girls, Ellen is going to have 2 boys and 2 girls. I have already met my soulmate and have strong feelings for him but he is rushing, and am going to live in this area for my whole life. Ellen is going to meet her soulmate in NY but she is not supposed to get serious because all the guys want to date her. I am going to be in some sort of occupation where I help people like children's medicine and Ellen is going to be some sort of business woman. We both have pink auras. Brian has a pink aura, but kinda mixed. He is the cause of accidents and he is rushed. When he grows up he is going to be an engineer or architect or build bridges, but in reality he always wants to be a rock star.) They got fake IDs, and Ellen got her cartilage on her ear pierced. Ate 12 cheese sticks. Spent the night at Ellen's.   Sunday:  Saw The Passion. Had movie night with Jessie and Holly, watched School of Rock. ATe Chinese!

Sat around for a bit b/c we thought that they were still there. Hung out at Schindhette's. We made bracelets, then went to the church and hung out in the cry room -- old senior high room. Ellen spent the night.   Wednesday:  Went to Schindhette's again. Brian came over. Bought strawberry daquaris with fake ID. I drank 2, Ellen 1, Brian 1. Me and Brian made out in the tree house. Brian got a ticket while speeding home. :(   Thursday:  Horseback riding in the morning, random riding around on the biciclyes in the afternoon around the bayou.
