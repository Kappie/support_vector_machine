Woke up later then I was supposed to. AGAIN. oh well...      DAMN IT... So pissed of at my sis... LEAVE ME ALONE. Sheesh, she wants the com again.       Oh whatever.       -Till...um.. later?-       Work it like you're working a pole     Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor     Pop it like you're poppin' a cork     Don't Stop, Don't Stop     Jerk it like you're making it choke     Break it like you're breakin' a code     Drop it till you're taking it lower
