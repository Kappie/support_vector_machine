You know what happens when 2 girls get together, it simply becomes a girly day out. Hahaha. ;) Well, we did study but we also masked our faces, ate yoghurt and digestive biscuits for lunch, surfed friendster (kalyn has an account!), listened to music, watched telly. It was fun having you around sweetie! The last time she came was last year, with Amesie Poo and Jess (with a sunflower) to visit me when I was ill. I love Jess I love Kalyn I love Amesie!!  The holidays are coming to an end soon. * Sigh * Like so soon.. By the way, are there any cures for Insomnia because I think I am suffering from it. I could not get to sleep last night. So I just tossed and turned in bed from 12 to 6. Jeremy told me to count 'Jeremy' but I think I should just stick to counting 'Sheeps' haha..   Yipee World Idol tonight! Someone told me that the Hobbit won. He's awesome!     Happy 16th Birthday Jeremy!!!   Thanks for being sucha' great brotha' man. It has been really fun sitting with you, hanging out and all. I hope we'll stay friends always! Take care and cows rule!
