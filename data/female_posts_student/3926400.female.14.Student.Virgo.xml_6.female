We (as in-the danceline) ran some around the track and did alot of "across the floors." Also in the morning, we learned all the flagwork to the short, slow song. Except for Jessie, and that's because she has a solo.  The second half of the day we cleaned.  Ugh . It was nasty, but the storage room looks SOO much better now.  I know that it's tiring and sweaty, but I love dancing and then playing the mallet percussion during concert season. If there weren't as many annoying and imature people in band, it would be a whole lot better. To me, it turns people away from the band to see musicians from the band act so childish.   They should be shot... in the head.
