I don't know what is going on with me but tonight didn't help much when Becky decided to be a freakin bitch.  What right does she have not letting me have my nephew? I've never felt so stupid before in front of so many people!  I feel has if I'm being punished for caring so much about that baby... maybe I should be more like John and not want to be so much in his life and I won't have to deal with things like this anymore? I dunno! I could understand if this was only the first time she's done this but it isn't -- She does it to me every time she has that baby in her arms!! She acts like its her child and it's not!!  It's not even her family yet no one even understands where I'm coming from.  Blah...  I need a hug!  I need to know about this insurance too!  It's already January 3rd and I haven't heard anything... I'm starting to worry that insurance didn't okay it!! If this happens what do I do next?! I can't stay this size its making me uncomfortable, lonely, miserable, and... just blah!!  I need sleep! It's 6 am and I've been up ALL night... again!
