(sorry mom) no pictures of that though. (audience breathes collective sigh of relief) i felt bold enough to buy it, but really it just meant that i sat down alot when i wore it. and sunburnt my rear pretty well. here are some random beach shots         urlLink    da beach urlLink      urlLink    and so on urlLink     it was very cool. then we went back to the lodge and watched cable ahhh the luxury!!!!
