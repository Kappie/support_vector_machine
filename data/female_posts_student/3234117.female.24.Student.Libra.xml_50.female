After reading  urlLink Travis'  blog and  urlLink Ashley's  blog I decided to post this evil quiz on mine as well so all my viewers could test their evilness.  Plus I just didn't know what else to post.  Anyway I scored a 33, not so bad.  Ashley scored a 43, which I already knew she was evil so it didn't surprise me and then her boyfriend  urlLink Jason  scored a 61.  Birds of a feather flock together! Just kidding.  No, I'm not.  Travis scored a 45 and Christina scored a 32.  Everyone should take the quiz and leave me a comment so I can assess your evil doings!  Check it out! Just click this  urlLink link .
