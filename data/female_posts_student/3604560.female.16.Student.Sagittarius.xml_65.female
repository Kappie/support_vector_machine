Wil: Well this is a tribute to Tamworth and the country music festival which is going on at the moment where the winner of the Shooting Star Award described himself as a city boy raised with country ethics, so we want a song about a city boy raised with country ethics. Adam: Hmmmm…. Wil: Could we also have mention of the Channel Ten blue dot, which we’re pushing for best new talent at this year’s Logies… Adam: You bet we are! Wil: And we said could there be a flash flood. That’s right a flash flood at some point. Adam: And we want someone to suffer from Anal Drover Ear, a medical condition that obsessive-compulsive sheep farmers get if they go swimming. Tripod, best of luck, its eight to eight, take it away!  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I got a yearning in my soul  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I can’t fill this empty hole  Tripod:    I always shut the gate 	  And I never turn up late 	  And I call everybody “mate” 	  Including you mum 	  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do mum  Scod:      Cos I still don’t feel like this is where I’m from.   Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  Why do I like spicy food? 	  Oh mamma… 	  Instead of “mate” I wanna call you “dude”  Gatesy:    I was raised a country boy 	  So why do I like soy milk? 	  And instant coffee always makes me gag  Tripod:    Instead of stubbies I want to wear JAG 	    And even Father John calls me a fag  Yon: Well son, I guess its time to tell you  Tripod:    In the flash flood  Yon:       Of eighty-three son,   Tripod:    You…  Yon:       Were brought to me son.  Scod:      You were shipwrecked out of Tamworth and your family was lost  Tripod:    And I raised you as my own  	  Like a monkey raised Tarzan   Gatesy: That makes so much sense mum. Somehow I’ve always known  Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  So that’s why I never felt at home 	  Oh mamma… 	  I wanna bust a rhyme on a microphone  Gatesy: Off the top of my dome, off the top of my dome Tripod:    And I won’t shed a tear 	  Take the first bus out of here 	  Gonna start a hip-hop act called Anal Drover Ear 	  We’ll be rapping country values for my career  Scod:      And I’ll be on Channel Ten within a year…  Tripod: “Click!”  Tripod:     Oh mamma… 	    I’ve got a yearning in my soul…
