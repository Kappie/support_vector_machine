I have been reading alot of live journals written by people my own age (college age that is.  I have found a number of startling similarities.    1)  Everyone feels lonely.   2)  Everyone feels that they are not living up to their potential.   3)  Everyone has emotional baggage from the past.   4)  We all want to be successful.   5)  We are all tired of college politics.   6)  We all want to find the perfect someone...    7)  We all feel that life could be better.   In response to these , I wonder about "us". About how far we have come, or not. Actually, many of us should not be lonely - we know plenty of people. So, what is the problem. I think that we are just making ourselves too busy for each other, and needless to say computers don't replace human interaction - no matter what.   Also, why aren't we living up to our potential? I think alot of us are, we just don't think we are living up to our  parents "wish list"  for us. I actually talked to an ARMY recruiter yesterday (to learn about the military for the FSE), however, I did learn alot of other things. I liked the attitude of ARMY, and I even believe that I would like it, if nothing else, for the structure and security of it. We have to take an initiative on our own, we have to find something that "drives" us.  For me, it is the FSE, I have found something that I really want - and I want it bad.  I have not worked for anything quite like this except my second barrier. (the music folks know what I'm talking about).   We need to dump the emotional baggage. Sounds so easy, but its not - we all know that. I talked with  Brad Owens  the other night, and in response to this subject he said "it is in the past, I don't see any reason to worry about anything". If we can all learn to do this, then as a whole this entire world would be "healthier".  We all want to be successful. That makes sense enough, but what constitutes "successful"? It is different for all of us.  We are the only ones that will know that will work for us individually. No one can tell you what will make you happy.  Money or love of the job? Power or independence? Computers or people? Prestige or just a job? There are so many different things that make us "tick".  What I can say is that we must, absolutely, do what makes us happy.  We have to tell our parents that we are happy with that choice, particularly if they are not. I know that I want to improve our social environment, now whether that is through arts administration, running Walgreens to supply medications to a community, or serving my country in the FS as a career I have yet to figure out. I course, I hope to start with FS.  College politics. Have I said enough? I hope so.  The other two, the perfect someone and a happy life (or "life can be so much better") can, but don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. I don't believe in a "perfect someone" but rather, "the perfect type of someone". The details on that is a whole other topic I'll write about on another lonely Friday night.  The happy life part will come when we get the other previous topics mentioned going in the right direction.    So that is my rambling for now on that.  On other topics I went to dinner w/  Miranda  and  Rick , and then became sick. I tend to stress myself out on VSO weekends, and this is not uncommon. I feel that I absolutely perform perfectly for the administration. I compete so hard with myself it drives me nuts. I am a perfectionist in so many ways its scary. The worst thing to me is [negative] criticism. Trust me, I give myself enough! There is one faculty member in the COA that everytime has something to say. I will never ever be able to please this person [this person not on VSO admin].   Oh well. On nights like this all I want is someone to cuddle with. That would be so nice. I might write more later, but I need a break.   I like the following quotes, so here they are. (Not really related to today's rambles of Liz -but just interesting)   "Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak, and to speak well, are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks." ~Ben Jonson (1573-1637)    Love, unconquerable, Waster of rich men, keeper Of warm lights and all-night vigil In the soft fact of a girl: Sea-wanderer, forest-visitor! Even the pure immortals cannot escape you, And mortal man, in his one day's dusk,  Trembles before your glory. ~Sophocles (495-406bc)    This one I really like, and agree with.   "Mine honor is my life; both grow in one;  Take honor from me, and my life is done."  ~Shakespeare
