Even though it isn't an A, like you all, but trig is difficult for me, so shut up.  On another note, strange things are going down this weekend, I can feel it. It's a vibe. Thursday was pretty strange and that isn't even part of the weekend!!   Who all *is* spending the night at Mandy and Laura's Party anyway? Someone fill me in like Craig David.
