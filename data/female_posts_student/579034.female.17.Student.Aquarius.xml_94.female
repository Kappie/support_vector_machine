My mom and me went to Short Hills Mall today and like she can't listen to like fast music when shes drivin so we had on a light station and ALL they played were songs that reminded me of him. Then, we get to the mall and I'm looking for Abercrombie and theres more light music!!! The techo that usually makes me squirm in A was a relief for once. I must have heard "A Thousand Miles" and "When I'm Gone" and "Here Without You" like 5 times each today. Then I was hit w/ a wammay in the car when they played "So Into You" and right after "Walked Right Out Of Heaven". I wanted to throw myself in front of a bus. Least I got some nice things though. I got 2 new pairs of jeans and these two zipper up sweater like things and this one white shirt. Nice stuff. Now I'm home and the hot dog and Wendy's burger I had earlier is catching up to me and I'm not feelin too hot. I'm gonna stay in tonight. Get going on that homework thats due on Monday, clean my room (Lord knows it needs it), and I'll prob veg out like usual. BUT! Don't you love the new layout??? Or at least the way I've twerked it? I felt so geeky, I was like sitting an inch from the computer screen and just like  trying to figure out what the codes meant and then I did and it was like a revelation or something. Well thats enough. x0x
