I'm going over to Caro's house before the dance to get ready with she and Allison, and they might get to spend the night afterwards. :-) I wish I had a date, but I'm going with the girls so it'll be fun! :-D  And guess who missed only ONE on their PHYSICS QUIZ?!? ME!!! Hell yeah! Maybe I'll get partial credit, because I named four rays, but not in frequency order. I didn't know the order. Whoops.
