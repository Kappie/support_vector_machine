So THAT'S cool.  ~ I got rid of all ((well, most of)) my stuffed animals tht were all over my bottom bunk! That's means when my friends come over, they'll actually have sumwhere 2 SLEEP instead of on the floor! I mean, they could sleep there b4 but there were SOOO many animals there wasn't much room... *smacks head* I fixed THAT though!!!   ~ Mitch  John hired my mom back at Hickory doing karaoke once a month just 2 see if they really DID lose a lot of ppl. HINT: Yeah!!!  ~ Ok well there's nothin else. G2g read every1 else's blogs 2 see what's up! L8TR!!!
