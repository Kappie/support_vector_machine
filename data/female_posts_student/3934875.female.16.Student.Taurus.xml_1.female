Shattered as usual.. So i got up early... Nah~ was jesting.. Woke up at 5 and noticed it was raining.. So i went back to sleep. And i woke up again at 8.30.. Nobody at home.. I don't know where's everyone.. Oh.. My parents probably has gone for breakfast.. And my younger sis got school today.. Nowadays, theres only 4 of us whose usually at home.. Cos my elder sis sleeps over at my grandma's place to accompany her. U know,those pantang-larangs.. The wife cant go out of the house for 4 mths after her husband passed away. And my bro is in NS so of cos i dun expect him to be home... Bt he said he's gonna stay hme after August.. I dunno la the reason.. Or mebbe i forgot. So.. its like 10 am now.. And im going out later.. To town with nana.. And then i tink we're gonna meet up with zsa,yana,dayah and farisah. I tink la.. I still dunno what to wear on tues!! No idea. Oh yeah.. My bro gonna treat us to dinner today i think.. Aiyah.. why must today? Sebok onli lah.. Rite now.. Im listening to I Dont Wanna Know by Mario Winans. The other day, Khairul dedicated this song to me. I totally dont get it... Since when i cheated on him? Like i cared anyway. Guys are all the same. =) Nono, most guys are all the same. Hehekz.. So this song is like staying put in my head. Cant get it out. ~I dont wanna know, if ur playing me keep it on a low~  Cos my heart cant take it anymore~ Im not dumb ok,i can read the words for myself but wtf has that gotta do with me? Nono, Khairul's not my bfren ok.. I dun tink he ever comes close in having potential to be one too.. Hehehehe.. Gosh,that was harsh. Bleugh. Oh yeah.. I came across one of my poems just now. The one i wrote abt Rusydi. Who is Rusydi? He used to be my very good guy friend bt all that has changed when he chose to go back to his bloody ex,Ayu. But now, he's with another girl,andI talked to her over the phone the otherday,and she sound real nice. Hope she wont break his heart. Yeah yeah.. Mebe i still like him.. but I gotta get realistic rite? =) He's just a friend. All i gotta do now, is to wait 4 prince charming to come and pick me up. Hahahaha.. Kiddingz. Unless that prince charming is at least 5cm taller than me (im 167 or 168cm aniwaes)and looks like Orlando Bloom then i'll eat my words..!Orites.. I'll update later. Meanwhile, I'll leave these words here.  ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,Cos thats how you want it to be...~    C ya..
