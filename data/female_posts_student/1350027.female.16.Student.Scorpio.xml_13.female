To catch the awesome, awesome line up of  Whence He Came ,  Buddhiston ,  Tiramisu ,  Spiral Kinetic Circus ,  Empress Empire ,  Elisebelle Tears  and  Afternoon Tea .  I'll just keep my fingers crossed and hope everything will go well and the show will be as fantastic as the very promising line-up. That and no perverts grapping my ass and trying to be funny.  After the show, It'd be back to Paul's place to get ready for his birthday dinner.  I'll see those of you who are coming there and try not to be late.
