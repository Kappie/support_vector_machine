There are so many I'll do one a day or so until I'm out of old stuff:  Lost In a Whirlwind  Spinning fast, so fast I can’t think the words inside my head fly through me I can’t stop; the French words being spoken outside my world are annoying Trying to focus on the task at hand is a chore as he drones on His monotone rant interrupted occasionally by his attempts at being a ballerina or actor But back in my world my own thoughts are a ticking time bomb Soon I’ll explode and my peers will dodge the flying debris of my twisted mind The words in Technicolor will slam into the cream colored walls of this institution Ducking from the exclamation points and semi colons they’ll hit the ground Trying to escape my whirlwind they’ve been lost in  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
