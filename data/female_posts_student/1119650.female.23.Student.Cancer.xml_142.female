To get started you'll need the following ingredients:       3 slices of the bread of your choice 1 croissant Butter or margarine spread 10 slices of american cheese (Land O'Lakes is perferred)  Triple Decker grilled cheese: Butter one side of each piece of bread.  Place the first slice of bread (butter side down) into a frying pan over medium heat and place the cheese on the side facing up.  (See Photo)     After the first side has had a chance to simmer, add the second piece of bread (butter side out) and flip the sandwich to brown this side.    While this side is browning and the first cooked side is facing up add more cheese and the final piece of bread butterside out.    Once the second side has had a chance to flip, put the third side face down in the pan and allow this to brown.    Remove from the pan and serve.  It should look something like this:        For a second delicious recipe I give you the bonus "Croissant grilled cheese":  Halve the croissant as pictured below (this one got a lil sloppy and broke into fours)     Follow a standard grilled cheese recipe and voilá!  Croissant grilled cheese!  This one wasn't as tasty as I had hoped it'd be and it looked a little wierd, but I think its just because it needed more cheese...well, that and its french (eeew)      I hope you enjoyed these delectible recipes.  Tune in next week, same blog time, same blog channel!!
