We may just lay out by the pool at the Crystal again. It's really warm out today.  About mid 80's and very sunny. Pretty weird to be two weeks from Christmas and in such a warm climate. I guess it's really cold in Texas about now. Most of the new people onboard are having season seaosn displacement. Just not really knowing what time of the year it is.   My friend Stephanie left the ship today. She got an email from Home Office yesterday that said she needed to attend a conference in Miami and from there she will head off for her vacation. I think she's planning on going home to Canada rather than traveling. She was pretty sad/excited to leave. Mixed emotions. I think I will feel the same. Especially since Lisa and I have become such good friends. I guess that's the way it goes though when you travel as much as people on ships do. I am sure we will all stay in touch though.   I am going to grab some food and head to the beach. I will write more about our afternoon escapades once I return.   Ciao,  Shelly
