At first I felt a little awkward, I was not used to the clutch and the balancing with the accelerator. Yeah, but I got the hang of it after I have no idea how many times the instructor made me do it. Oh and another thing. This instructor taught my bro 4 years ago which is pretty cool. For an old man he's got pretty darn good memory, even remembered how he looked like and that he liked to drive fast. Uhm, well, that's a problem for me too coz everytime i hit the accelerator, I just totally  hit  it you know? The instructor was all like, just tap it. oh well. My holidays are nearly over, so I kind of have to rush the lessons a bit and so we arranged classes for everyday this week except thursday. He's gonna let me take the car out to the road tomorrow. Way cool! Lol. I really can't wait to get my license and drive to college and everywhere. Ha-ha. That's if Mom and Dad get me a car in the first place. -)  I'm so jealous of Wk. He got the JPA scholarship which covers  everything . Every single damn thing down to his last pencil. How unfair is that? I really wanted it too but I did not apply for it. How dumb can I get?? I still kick myself over the head until today. So, Wk has been posted to Australia for engineering and meanwhile they want him to do his A-Levels at Taylor's still. Not that bad since he's already here at Taylor's. I envy him so! Real lucky fella. I would give an arm and leg to go to USA, figuratively speaking.
