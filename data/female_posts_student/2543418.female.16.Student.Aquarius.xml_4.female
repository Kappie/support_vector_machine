Ok so theres my day in a nut shell. But seriously, in A-block we watch finding Nemo in spanish with english subtitles. (gag me now) And in P.E. Mrs. Moore was raggin on us for misbehaving and she only played half om my cd in the gym. (she had ot play katies bs Incubus. And im not knocking Incubus, but there old cd was better)AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I JAMMED MY FINGER AND ITS BALOONED UP LIKE A MOFO! Lunch was ok. Not as eventfull as yesterday with the milk contest and such but it was marginally good. In C block i had a math test which (with my gimpy finger) I failed. what else is new eh? BUT the biggest piece of luck came in D block when I was picked 19th in my oral (haha) presentation yes! So now i get to go tomorrow! AND I have no other homework tonite other than memorising my oral (hehe) presentation! This calls for a big whooooot! thank you, that is all.  B.T.W. Rachel was wearign full bums today!
