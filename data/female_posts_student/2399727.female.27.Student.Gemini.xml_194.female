I'm still in Steeltown because I have a dental appointment at 8am tomorrow, after which I will catch a bus back to the Big Smoke and begin my week of insanity.  I have an experiment to do for Psych100 every day (Mon-Wed), for which I will get 3% in the course.  Seems like it's worth 3 hours of my time, doesn't it?  What we will do for an A, I tell you.   Not to mention what wacko things this might do to my head, and God forbid, my eyes.  I have class Monday and Wednesday night, dinner out at a buffet style restaurant on Tuesday with M., lunch with L. on Wednesday, and in there I have to squeeze in three trips to two different libraries.  Thursday is Father's Day/Birthday here, Friday is CNIB at 9am and voting at noon.  Saturday is housesitting and cat-sitting again.    So, if the Blog falls a little quiet this week, my faithful readers know why.   Monday is the anniversary of the trip to St. Joe's ER with an IOP of 57.  Everything was completely white.  They said, "Can you see the top letter on that eye chart?"  I replied, "What eye chart?"   No wonder I have almost no peripheral vision now.  More to come...   urlLink     urlLink
