I am in an unusually bad mood still, because of various things I won't be going into due to other various things... ^^;   One thing though: extremely happy that I got the Underworld soundtrack! Yaa! Four songs featuring May-b0y, and lots of others that are just wowie. I am terribly pleased, to say the least. I have discovered an entire new genre of music that is just  perfect  -- apparently A Perfect Circle / Tool aren't the only bands who are awesome!! *woo* Be happy for me ^^;   Apparently industrial metal is what my ears were designed for or something. Iunno. I just know that it's fucking awesome. Pardon my english. o_O *is lame*   So that's all for now, folks, tune in next blog.
