I also managed to get a top for Jo's party but the only problem with it is that I have to get someone else to tie it up at the back. Lol. So no one better un-do it. Grrr. I also brought some fish net tights! Again LOL. And I got some hair straighters which are cool because yes, they actually work! Wooo! What a really nice day it is today. Who wants to go down the park next week? So long as it is hot that is. I am thinking Wednesday. Tell me what you think.
