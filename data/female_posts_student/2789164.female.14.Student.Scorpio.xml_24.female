Anyway yesterday in hymn prac the head teacher announced the winners of the end of year prizes. In each year there is a prize winner and then highly commended. I never get these so i was EXTATIC when i got highly commended - its great cos one person i dont like didnt get one and she was soooooo pissed off!!! hardiharharhar!!! ;) - woo! go me!
