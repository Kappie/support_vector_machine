As I've mentioned before my math teacher was in Tigeroar. Jonathan, wasnt he a cutie patootie lol. He was cool, I mean for a math teacher and all!  To the next random thing, I want an iPod. It doesnt even have to be a mini one. Just an iPod will do. I need something to put all the songs I love into one compact device! I mean, who goes from wanting to listen to Usher to wanting to hear Alison Krauss or however you spell it! I also want a picture phone. I'll pay for it. If someone will give me the money. I mean, I have a job. Not a steady one, but it still pays good. I also want to play the guitar. Maybe thats my problem, I want to many things. Nah, that couldnt be it!! lol.  Now, I start thinking about Isaac. I try not to think about that to much when i'm alone. I get sad. Not all the time, I mean the kid is absolutely wonderfully AWESOME!! I have more fun talking to him then I do with some people my own age. But lately, I just get sad. I started thinking about my moms old high school friend. To say the least she was a partyer. Still is. Has a liver who in her own stupidity destroyed it. And heres Isaac, completely innocent little boy who's born with a liver that isnt the best for him. I dont understand stand sometimes. But we're not suppose to understand all the time. I love that family. They mean a lot to a lot people at NSCC. OKAY, i really have to stop now.  As I conclude my very random post i just want to say, have a great life. Enjoy your friends and family and be nice!! I love you all!   Peace and Chicken  - anna g -
