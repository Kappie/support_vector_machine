It's a locally-owned Mexican place, and while the food is OK, my Aunt had failed to mention that they don't clean particularly well. Lovely. My cousin Brandi got sick too, so I know it's not just my sensitive stomach again. The problem is that they've all been going there every Thursday night since Uncle Ronnie died, so it's become tradition now. I'm leaving for Cuba in just a few weeks, and the last thing I need right now is to get sick.  Yesterday Brandi and I took the 45-minute drive to Sugarland to see The Terminal and eat at Souper Salad. We both liked the movie alot, although the ending was a bit different than what we had expected. It was so nice to just spend some quality time with her, a fellow 23-year-old. Although she is having trouble with her former insurance company in covering her MD Anderson medical expenses, she does recognize that she's lucky to be alive. If God had not performed a miracle and the first diagnosis of her brain tumor had actually been correct, her 6 months would be up and she'd be dead by now.  I'm so excited about the Cuba mission trip on July 23rd; I can't wait to go back to my beloved Cuba, but this time under a religious rather than academic context. I am, however, going to take extensive notes; I might need them later for my thesis research.  Tomorrow I get to see Caroline in Houston! I have a meeting about the Cuban mission trip on Sunday at 3pm, so she invited me to stay the night in Houston so that I wouldn't get lost trying to find the Methodist Church (I've never driven to Houston by myself, and I have an absolutely horrible sense of direction). Caroline is leaving soon for a job in Arizona, so I honestly don't know when I'll get to see her next :( This is a very good opportunity for her, though.
