Today was pretty fun!!  My mum, my sister and I went shopping for paint to color the exterior of our house! It was SO fun! I stole like 200 of those paint chip thingys and my mum got me double sided tape so I can plaster my walls with them! Hahaha!   Then I went home for a bit. AFter I like blow dryed my hair (it was fun!) we went to a CYT picnic. It was pretty fun! My friend Jauclin was there! woot woot! But then Jenny got in like  a pixie stick fight with Lauclin and ended up pouring a whole pixie stick in my hair. It was sad... :)   Do you think I should be in HYPE next year?  Its like High School Youth Pursuiting Excelence. It's a CYT thing. Yoou have to go to meetings and stuff.  yeah.. Lallalalallala
