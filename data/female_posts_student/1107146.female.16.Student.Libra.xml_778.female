It's sort of a tricky one but not entirely unmanageable.  Alright, as to the first part...hitting a latency stage at the moment, I just have to wait stuff out...wait for Eegee's to get here...go out to find that damn box...grr. I saw one with a picture insert thingy on top, but I don't have any pics to put in it, very sadly. Hmm. I've got plenty of time, tho. It's the first thing in about 16 years that I haven't procrastinated on, either, so I'm sort of happy that my motivation isn't being totally tapped. I don't see how it could, really. Alright alright, no more talking, I'm on caffeine.  Bonjourno dudes, and bueno weekend.
