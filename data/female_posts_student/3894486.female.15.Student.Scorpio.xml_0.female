It was alot of fun. we went swimming with the kids and for dinner my mom made really good tacos. All of the kids loved her tacos. We also jumped on the trampoline and played volleyball. Danielle spent the rest of the night looking at zulphia's pictures with her and zulphia gave me and danielle each a braided friendship bracelet that she had made. It was so sweet. When we got home we went to alex's house because he's leaving on saturday morning and I won't see him today because I'll be with maria and I don't want to ruin everything I have planned for her. He told me he was gonna miss me and that he'd call me on saturday. *sigh* I miss him already...
