I don't find the logic in that because he only has to rent a tux, buy a tie, and a corsage. So he told me that he might not be able to go to prom. *weep* I don't think i could find another guy on short notice. I hope i won't have to deal with it. oh well i won't stress. i'm quite tired. so its off to homework and then bedtime yay!  Matrix: Low Battery, -Betso
