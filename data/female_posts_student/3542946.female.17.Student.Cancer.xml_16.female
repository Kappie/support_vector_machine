Recent events have put the site under threat and there have been calls to move it and delete all the previous information to protect our revolutionary motives. I urge Max not to be intimidated by the conformist educational forces. We are entitled to our opinions if they are not offensive.   Also I have inside information that a secret terrorist cell of young liberals is being set up inside the school. They are already starting to brainwash students and we must act fast to counter this threat. Stand firm Comrades!
