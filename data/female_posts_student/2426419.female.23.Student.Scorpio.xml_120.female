Some higher level of careerness. I might be a stock broker when I grow up.  And now . . . the greatness of Valentine's week. I should wear my Wal-Mart angel wings to work, although I'm not sure how professional that would be. Valentine's Day is my fourth favorite holiday because it celebrates love and passion and pink and red candy hearts, friendship, Charlie Brown, and Power Ranger Valentine cards.  (the following are my fave holidays. come on, you all want to know).  1. St. Patrick's day (it's green sparkles and Irish and Catholic - what, I ask, could be better?) 2. Thanksgiving (I have very nice, pumpkin candle, crepe paper turkey memories of this holiday). 3. Christmas (I would be such a sinner if I didn't like this one in the top three. Actually, this holiday is the most romantic of all with the warm golden lights, and roasted marshmallows, and apple cider). 4. St. Valentine's Day  All the other holidays sort of run together, although I have always wanted a tee shirt to celebrate Boxing day. Isn't that some holiday in Canada? It probably has some horrible historic background, like it was the day when large ancient turtles called "boxings" plummeted to a gruesome death and became extinct. If so, I'm truly regretful of my desire for an article of clothing that would celebrate that day.   But in my mind, I just think of Canadians walking around in red boxing gloves. Don't tell me that doesn't deserve a shirt.
