It is a monster, a Frankenstein creation with a life of its own, sitting pretty at 17, 206 words (I was aiming for around 10,000).  So I took myself out for coffee, and sat down to go over it, aiming to try and cut out 5,000 words.   I gave up after an hour and a half.  It's terrible.  It's rubbish.  It's total codswollop.  Aiiya! Should I push 'new document' and begin again?  Can anything be redeemed from this wordy, ginormous, rather useless addition to the realm of human knowledge?  The funny thing is, when I look at my outline, with its terribly organised-looking numbering system, it really looks like I'm presenting a decent piece of research.  There must be something in that, at least.  It's just when I start explaining the intricacies of the development of the local community I somehow transform a fairly straightforward presentation of data into a discussion on the nature of humanity.   I think I need to take each individual section, and polish it as an essay of 2000 words; correcting myself as harshly as I do my students.  Hopefully if I can do this, the hugeness of the whole undertaking will be slightly diminished.   So I've come up with this:  Chapter 5 - Jiuzhaigou  5.1 - Site of research   Description of area  The people  The park   5.2 The Case Study Community  5.3 Community Understanding of Well-being   Terminology  Health  Education  Family  Other aspects  Summary   5.3 Changes in Wellbeing   Livelihood aspects  Choice and opportunities  Cultural and social aspects  Access to benefits   5.4 (don't have a heading for this yet -- Contributing factors??)   Characteristics of tourism in the area  Attitudes and skills of the local community  Contribution of local government policy   Now that sounds fairly reasonable doesn't it?  Let's just see if I can make it sound that logical as I discuss each point.
