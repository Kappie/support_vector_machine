Earlier in the semester, when the future ahead of me was bright and unclouded, or at least when I wasn't worried about exams, I thought "oh, it doesn't matter that I have exams back to back like that, since I don't have any exams for over a week from the end of class to the first of my finals, I'll be fine, I don't need to get one of them moved or anything."  Well, now I rather wish I had gotten one of them moved, which is one of my few rights as a law student, but, alas, I took a whimiscal and romantic approach to the whole process, which would account for the feeling I have now like I've been hit by a truck.  And it isn't even over yet.  I still have two more to go.  Yes, folks, that's right, and they are two biggies.  I honestly think I could fail Business Organizations.  At the very least, I am expected to do poorly and have it as a constant anchor on my GPA, in all its 4 credit splendor.  Ah, well.  It could be worse.  On a better front, I sort of have my summer plans worked out, and it will involve the actual earning of money, which is something I am in very desperate need of.  Not a lot, mind you, but every little bit helps.  And for this I don't even mind spending my summer in Queens.  It is cooler there than it is in Manhattan anyway.   Well, I guess I'd better get back to it, as they say.  Though the lack of sleep has given me a headache that I'm quite sure no knowledge can permeate, especially not boring law school knowledge (though I'm sure I could fill my head with useless trivia) so I may just give it up at some point and rejoin the world of the studious and the living tomorrow.
