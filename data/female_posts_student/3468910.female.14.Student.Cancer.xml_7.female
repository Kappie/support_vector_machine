No matter what we do (no matter what we do) No matter what we say (no matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (sun will always, always shine) But tomorrow we might awake On the other side  We are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down We are beautiful in every  urlLink single  way Yes, words can't bring us down So don't bring me down today...  Don't you bring me down...today... Don't you bring me down...mmmmm...today... [
