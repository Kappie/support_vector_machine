(He's as sweet a dog as anyone's ever had!)  Let's see... My job... I find people elligible to undergo a procedure to cure cancer and other terminal illnesses. It's really pretty exciting. I've actually had a couple people say no to it before. I don't really have many hobbies. I mostly just hang out around my house when I'm not working, play with Garshie, help my friend's son with his homework, etc. Sometimes I'll meet some friends at O'Malleys for lunch or dinner, but that's about it.
