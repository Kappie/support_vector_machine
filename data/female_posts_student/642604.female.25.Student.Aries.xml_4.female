Why is it that you keep coming back and making these promises that things are going to be different this time, WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME???  In the end you go back and I stay here and I don't get to have you.  Do you understand you are breaking me?  Do you understand what it's like for me?  I don't even get any time at all to try and get over you and just when I think maybe I can do this all by myself you fucking swoop in again and do this!  LET ME GO!
