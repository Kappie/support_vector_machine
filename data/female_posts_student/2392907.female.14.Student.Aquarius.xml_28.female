Stupid male, probably spotted some hot chick with a hot car and couldn't help himself.   "So, um, you look great," says Adam, brushing away the spot of saliva on his shirt. "Heh, thank you. Um, you don't clean up bad yourself." The two simultaneously give out a nervous laugh.  Oh god.  they think simultaneously.  "Some wine?" says the waiter, popping up from nowhere, and trying to look down Jane's top.  "Erm, ok. What you got?" says Adam, not very knowledgeably.  "Would you like to try the new import we have just received from Southern France this evening?" "Why not? Jane?" "Yes, that would be nice," she says, smiling at the waiter.  Oh ho, she's smiling at me!  thinks the waiter.  I think i'll slip just my number under her napkin...   And so the waiter walks away with a grin on his face and comes back with the wine.  "This is nice," says Jane, nodding. "Yeh," agrees Adam, although he doesnt really agree; he decides he'd rather have a bottle of budweiser.  "Hmm."
