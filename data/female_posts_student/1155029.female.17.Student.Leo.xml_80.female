I discovered e.e. cummings yesterday. line of the day is: "may came home with a smooth round stone  as small as a world and as large as alone." not for any reason more particular than because it flowed into my mind and stuck there.   I think it's nice that Jeremiah's pants have a condom pocket.  How lovely and not at all inappropriate, perhaps it's a German thing.
