I tried calling some of my friends earlier, but no one answered.  Maybe that's because the three that I tried to call all have caller ID.  I was calling from my brother's cell phone, so maybe they didn't want to pick up a call from someone out of town, or lond distance.  I donno.  Maybe it was just because they didn't know the number so they thought that I was a telemarketer or something.  I donno.  Like I said before, I'm getting a little sleepy, but I don't know why really because I slept all day in the car.  I'm bored.  My brother isn't being too much fun.  But this really is alot better then being with my parents.  Hopefully after a good night's sleep, they won't be so craby tomarrow.  They were really bitchy today.  Oh well.  At least it was somewhat understandable.  I suppose I should cut them alittle slack, I mean, we are on vacation afterall, but on the flip side, I think that they should cut me some slack.  I am getting to be too old to go on family vacations.  I just wanna stay home and hang out with my friends.  Maybe next time, they'll let me stay home alone.    I feel kinda bad about asking for the next three weekends off at work.  The next one, I'll be coming home from this trip, the weekend after that, I'm gonna be babysitting overnight for the Carabello's.  Hopefully, this will prove to my parents that I am old enough to stay home alone.  I mean, after all I will be staying by myself, and taking care of two kids.  How exciting is that!  Anyways, the weekend after that, we are going to be going back to Winona for labor day weekend.  Then I think that I am gonna have to go back to school.    School.  It's coming up pretty soon.  Next tuesday, the one after I get back from here, it's regestration at school.  I think that Amanda and I are gonna go together, but I'm not sure yet.  I haven't really had a chance to talk to her.  Besides, That night I'm gonna have to go right to work afterwards, so maybe that will be a good thing if she works, but it also might be just another reason why we can't do anything on tuesday.  I donno.  She's a pretty cool person usally.  Sometimes she can be a little braty, girly, mean and selfish, but i know that everything she does, she does in good faith, and humor.  It seems like she's always smiling, just like me.  And she's got tons of friends because she's usally so nice.  I just remembered something that I was thinking before.  Maybe when my parents go to Winona, I'll be able to stay home by myself.  I mean, I did have to suffer through them on this vacation, and I will be proving myself the weekend before at the Carabello's house...  Oh the possabilities....  The aproatch is going to be tricky though.  Prehaps, I should put on a game face this week, try to make the best of everything, and not really piss them off.  Then, when we get home, in the middle of the week, I should bring up the possibilitiy of staying by myself.  I can bring up the fact that starting off with the Carabello's would be a good begining, and also that I would be able to get used to freedom's and responsabilities that come with being home alone.  I've been longing for freedom, and for them to trust me enough to stay alone for the entire weekend!!!!  OH  how wonderful does that sound.  I will have to be very careful and persice in my planning though.  Bring up the topic at just the right time, have my arguments carefully planned out and everything...  I'll start thinking right now.  I don't want to get my hopes up or anything, but think of the possabilities!!!!!  I'll do some more thinking on the subject and report back later!!  Lol,  Ani
