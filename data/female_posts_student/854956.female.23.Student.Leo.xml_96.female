It's funny, because this past weekend, I tried to come off as a non-violent person... and I'd like to believe in comparison to Mike that I'm not... but it was so funny because he was like, "You're kidding, right?!  You've gotten REALLY violent with me before!!!  You ARE violence..."  and he, Ricky, and I just laughed really hard, because... it's true.  I'm friggin' violent when I get pushed past the breaking point.  Maybe that's why I like the Limp Bizkit song, "Break Stuff."  :-)
