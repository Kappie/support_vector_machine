This is making me so fucking mad that it deserves its own post. So, my best friend, entitled: L.  She's cool and funny and all of that jazz and has perfectly horrible taste in guys.  I mean... the only semi-worthwhile guy she has ever dated didn't have any arms.  And normally, it doesn't bother me.  I mean, it DOES because the relationships always end up in tears and alcohol and stuff....  But.... THIS TIME BEATS EVERYTHING.  She's fallen in love with M, who is a lying, cheating FUCKBUCKET with a known history of being a PLAYER.  He ALSO has a kid, and an ex-girlfriend whom he visits constantly, and apparently has a say in his "relationship" with L. And, being a FRIEND that LOOKS OUT FOR HER (or at least tries my damndest) I talked to her about M and we DECIDED that he was a NO GOOD FUCKER and that me and Jason and Nick were going to KILL HIM and.... Then today.  I called her on her cell, because she sent me a crazy ballistic email about hating people....  And guess who she was with?  You guessed it: M.  They were talking and laughing like nothing had gone down between them which obviously was NOT THE FUCKING CASE and I wanted to fucking slap her. But she's never listened to me before.  Why should she start now?  I guess the thing that sucks most about it is how she deserves way better than him.  Why does summer bring out the drama in people?  I guess it's because there's no school to distract them....
