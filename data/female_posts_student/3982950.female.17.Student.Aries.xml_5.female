I haven't decided whether or not I'll let anyone find me here. On one hand, I need a place where I can freely spill my thoughts. On the other hand (in addition to different fingers), I have an intense desire for someone to understand me, to know what I'm thinking, to see all that is flawed and imperfect about me . . . and accept me anyway.        I have found acceptance in countless places. My church. My youth group. My school. My friends. CMC. However, last Sunday I returned to my old church after a four year absence -- the only place where I have ever been utterly and completely rejected -- and realized thatI no longer had any desire to win acceptance there. I wonder why it is thatI desire acceptance so deeply, yet whenI don't receive it (and even when I do) I simply move on the the next source of it. I suppose the reason for my search is simply that I am a relational being (though my introverted personality struggles toadmit it), and I was designed to crave acceptance. However, I have yet to find it unconditionally. . .        That's not what I intended to say . . . but I suppose that'salright.
