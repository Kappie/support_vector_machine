So to avoid many people in the hospital, burnt tear ducts, blistery skin...and to promote the sunscreen market, Amanda suggests that one does not swim eight ours in direct sunlight without sunscreen. This will result in a lobster-like appearance. Also,  doing so, could cause intense, stinging pain. If you have tanned skin and don't burn, do not heed to this waring...but...when you look like a rattlesnake...don't come to my monkeys...it's your fault that you were stupid enough to stay outside for so god damned long. BUT...for all you other folks, excluding African-Americans, those of Hispanic or Latino heritage, or the aformentioned lucky folks who tan, do NOT stay in the sun for a long time without sunscreen. It hurts.    Oh, and from now on..my name is...Panda! Woohoo!   =Panda
