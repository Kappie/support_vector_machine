I think I'm the only person who doesn't really like the season itself normally. Usually it's too hot or rainy or...mosquitoish for me. Although...swimming is good. :)   So, Chris IM'dme the other day saying he needed to talk to me about something later but then, he never did anything about it so I guess he changed his mind. Oh well. Not a big deal then I guess.  On a happy note, Ryan and I have been talking a lot...again. This always happens over the summer. It's kind of that reassuring summer friendship that I know I'll have, although...after last summer, I wasn't sure we'd really start talking again. I realized today how nice it is that I'm on good terms with all my past boyfriends. Even the first Ryan...and that ended less than nicely. How many people can truly say that? That they're on good terms with all their past boyfriends/girlfriends? Then again, some people do have a lot more people that they'd need to get along with then.   And, I have this...extremely popish song in my head. I don't think it's bad. It's got awful lyrics though.   I’ve been waiting all day for ya babe So won’t you come sit and talk to me And tell me how we’re gonna be together always Hope you know that when this late at night I hold on to my pillow tight I think ‘bout how you promised me forever I never thought that anyone could make me feel this way Now that you’re here boy all I want is just a chance to say  Get out (leave) right now It’s the end of you and me It’s too late (now) and I can’t wait for you to be gone Cause I know about her (move) And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  Tell me why you looking so confused When I’m the one that didn’t know the truth How could you ever be so cold? You go behind my back and call my friend Boy you must’ve fallen and bumped your head Because you left your number on her phone So now that after all that you’ve said and done Maybe I’m the one to blame but To think the one that you could be the one Well it didn’t work out that way  Get out (leave) right now It’s the end of you and me It’s too late (now) and I can’t wait for you to be gone (you to be gone) Cause I know about her (move) And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies (all the lies) You said that you would treat me right (you said that you) But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  I wanted you right here with me But I have no choice you’ve got to leave Because my heart is breaking with Every word I’m saying. I gave up everything I had On something that just would not last But I refuse to cry No tears will fall from these eyes (ohh, ohh)  Get out Get out (leave) right now It’s the end of you and me (you and me) It’s too late (now) and I can’t wait for you to be gone (you to be gone) Cause I know about her (move) And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies (how did I …) You said that you would treat me right (you said that you) But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  Get out (leave) right now It’s the end of you and me (hey yeah) It’s too late (now) and I can’t wait for you to be gone (you to be gone) Cause I know about her (move) And I woner (why) how I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right (treat me right) But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  Get out (leave) (you and me) It’s too late (too late) (now)  About her (now) (why)  You said that you would treat me right But you was just a waste of time (ohh)    Yeah, sure, it has poor grammar and the lyrics are absolutely dreadful but it's catchy.  I'm thinking of possibly printing my entries and making an actual journal...you know...a written one, the ones that were written before mankind's great technological advancements came into play. Maybe I'll go find myself a quill. Heh heh. I can see myself writing with one now. Maybe I'll bring one to school this year with a little bottle of ink. "Catie, can I borrow a pen?" "Here, have some ink and a quill." I suppose letting someone borrow your pen or...quill back in those days was a lot more risky than it is these days. And, I'm not joking, it's risky. You lend someone a pen, they dash out of class with your pen, you lose your other pen, probably while getting bumped in the hallway by endless hoards of freshman, and you get to history class where you're taking notes on the great Roman emperors and later after not taking notes, you try to study but you can't remember whether it was Tiberius or Caligula who did whatever. But really, getting back to what I was saying, it would have been much more expensive those days. I'm sure pens must be comparatively cheaper than a quill and ink. Not to mention a Heck of a lot less people were literate while quills and ink were popular. I wonder when bic was invented...  Anyway, my whole point in all of this is that I'm considering printing my previous entries from this thing, which would be a large project when I consider that I've written in this for almost two years. I think I've gotten too attached to this thing. I admit I might have a problem. And now...I'm off to go look up when bics were invented. God bless bics.
