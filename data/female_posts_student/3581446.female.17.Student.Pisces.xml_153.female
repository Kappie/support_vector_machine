It's a picture of a Toucan...He's standing up and looking at me. I drew his whole family. This pseudo-German, Dirk, killed one of his brothers...He was the Golf Bird though, so since Golf is a stupid waste of time, I decided to write it off as a mercy killing.  If any of you subscribe to magazines, may I suggest in the future you go to eBay to order them? The deals are tremendous, almost unbelievable. I highly recommend that you visit there.  I'll leave you with a quote: America is a melting pot, the people at the bottom get burned while all the scum floats to the top. - Charlie King
