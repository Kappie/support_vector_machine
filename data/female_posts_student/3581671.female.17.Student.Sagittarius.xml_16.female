Well...................................................................................................................................  lets start with how my day went.  i'm kind of feeling a little stressed out right now.  maybe a little bit more than a little.  School is coming to a close and I found out today that I have a D+ in my AP Gov. class.  I don't get D+'s so it is kind of freaking me out.  Luckily I still have a high point project to turn in and that can (and will) raise my grade by a whole letter.  I just won't tell my parents that I ever had a D+ in the class.  Running is also stressing me out.  God I cannot stand the snot-nose red head on our team!!  I won't name her because I'm sure someone somewhere would read this and report it back to her.  She is such a wench (is that a bad word and did I spell that correctly?).  I'll tell you the story... anyways, I'm going to be a senior on the cross country team and the first two lockers in the locker room go to senior (typically captains but those won't be decided until the end of the summer).  Wench-girl and her best friend (I'll call her drama-girl) decided they want the first two lockers even though I have more seniority over both of them, esp. Wench.  Well, I asked the current owner of the locker I want if when she moved out I could have her locker, since we have been best friends for quite awhile.  She said yes and I was looking forward showing Wench off, however, wench girl was determined to have the locker I wanted.  Our coach got wind of this issue and decided to have a meeting to discuss locker arrangements.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of this because I want to try (and I'll stress the word try) to be the non-drama queen so I wasn't keen on having the meeting.  But alas, the meeting never happened, our coach had to postpone it due to some meeting.  Anyway, after school the girl who owns the locker asked if I wanted to move into right then and there.  I told her no because that would be rude, we are going to have a meeting sometime to decide who gets which locker, it was common courtesy.  I went on my before practice run and when I got back, dum dum dum, wench girls name is on the locker we both want.  I can't believe she went and claimed the locker before we had the meeting.  Grrrr.... that really ticks me off.  Anyway... after reading this, my problem sounds completely trivial, juvenile, and just plain dumb.  Oh well.  That's all I have to write for now.  good-bye and hope tomorrow brings happy things.!!       katie
