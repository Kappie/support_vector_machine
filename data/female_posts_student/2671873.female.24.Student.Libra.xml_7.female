Actually I think its the change in the weather, but I like to blame it on all the hard work I am doing here. (or lack there of) This term has been absolutely crazy, and as I look at all the work I have done I realize I have done nothing of great importance.  I have read a couple articles describing the Peace Making failures in recent times, and I have come to question the importance of a democratic government, or at least a democratic super power.  So I guess one would say that my course is going well...making me question what is so natural for me to assume is right.  Now its time to get that ever dreaded dissertation started.  But that leads to another question...where do you start.  I don't really have a specific peace related subject to start with.  I was thinking about doing something on Latin America and justice, but as I said earlier...where to start.  If any of you have suggestions please please please let me know.  I am at such a loss.  But I have nearly 11 months to figure it out, so its not all that bad.  My biggest concern now is what to do with my life when May approaches.  Where do I move and what field of Peace and Conflict to I want to enter into.  And how do I apply and get a job when I am living in Ireland?  I know it will all fall into place when it needs to, but I have this ever large debt to the American government for my education and don't know where to start to pay it back.  Blech. Maybe I should fake my death then I would be able to have my loans forgiven and start debt free.  OOOOOh, there is a good plan.  hehehe.  Well this is my mindless and bizarre ramblings for this week. Sorry to subject you all to the randomness that is my mind.  :)
