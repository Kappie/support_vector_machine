Somehow emotions took over and possessed my mind into another dimension making me feel so jealous. I dont want to feel this way but the thought of someone taking over hurts. It leads my mind into thinking of all the odds. I feel that it is so difficult to control my emotions, my feelings. I dont want to feel this way nor do I want to go through this alone. I hate the fact of knowing that there is someone else.
