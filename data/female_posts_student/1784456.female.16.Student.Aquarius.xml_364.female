Why shouldn't the druggies get it if it's legalised? Tobacco's leagalised, maybe the druggies shouldn't get tobacco. That's a drug. I researched it. I know what I'm doing. I think it should be legalised for every one! Peace out! For MS patients, people with cancer, people over the age of 16 who can smoke. People in our year smoke, why don't we go have a go at them? We don't because it's socially acceptable to us. So cannabis isn't? Why shouldn't it be, it actually helps you in some cases and it's just like smoking. Yeah, drinking messes up your liver but people still do it. People our age do so if you're gonna kill yourself through some drug or another why not do it through cannabis and keep the cigarette people happy. Unless you want to go smelling like smoke. What I'm saying is that cannabis isn't that bad, it's probably a tiny bit better than smoking because it has healing properties and even though it's a drug so's alcohol and that's legal so cannabis should be too. Druggies should get it. Heck, we're all druggies. We all drink at some point and some of us smoke.  urlLink http://www.overgrow.com  :) So legalise it already!
