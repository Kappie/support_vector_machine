My mom has changed the way she treats me; she's trying to make me more responsible and 'prepared'. Anway, I had my last day of tests today. I went to school earlier than usual because the car was banned, and that gave me more time to study for Christian Living, Araling Panlipunan and Journalism. Luckily for me, the tests weren't that hard. :) After that, I had practice for our presentation that we'll be presenting tomorrow, and went home with Camilla while my parents were at Greenhills. Had  three slices of cheese pizza for lunch, then we went out to buy mangos so I could help Camilla make Maki, but just as we finished slicing all the mangos, my parents came to pick me up. Then we went home and since then I've been doing nothing but become a blob in front of the computer. Actually, I should be playing right now... but I'm out of money. *sigh* Not really and eventful day.  I logged on to  urlLink Friendster  earlier to find out my brother already has an account. 0_o Well, now he's my friend, so no worries. Not much more to say... so peace out.
