So here goes, im a usual girl i like shopping and lookin at the cutest boy going my way, i have never had a bad relationship or anything really traumatic happen to me (so far) so im not angry with life or anyone at the moment and i just believe everything does happen for a reason, even the bad things in life. I have a close group of 4 friends who id do anything for and believe they would do anything for me to, i also have many more 'aqauintences' lets say who i like but know most of the girls are probably bitchin behind my back, as it is what most girls live to do for some reason unkown to me, ive finnaly finshed high school now and begin college in september, personally i cant wait to go as i think it will be more relaxed and less boring as highschool was, dont get me wrong i loved highschool at the time but towards the end of may i belived it was the right time to be leaving it as grew tiring, and seemed to be repeating itself again and again, anyway im going to leave this post as it is and will make sure i post more in the near future.
