Billy left in the middle of the night, last night! My mom woke me up early this morning to tell me. She is so upset; she's trying to hold it all in but I know for a fact she just wants to break down and cry. (because even though he can really piss me off at times, tears are streaming down my face.) I don't know where he is...Last night wasn't a good night for me! I got in to a very bad arguement with a very good friend. I may have lost him as a best friend as well... I just want to stop hurting all together. I need to some how put an end to it all! urlLink
