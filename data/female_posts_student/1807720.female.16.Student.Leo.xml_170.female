It's official, I dumped Edi but I mean we are still going to go out and still going to be friends.  It comes down to the fact that we have a bit of an attraction for each other, but we are very different.  Our lifestyles and just what we like to do, what we would prefer, and just the way we were brought up.  Everyone is different, but there is a point to draw the line.  My Grandma is coming in from Winnipeg today and she is going be like "oh poor you, your sick" and I don't like it when people feel sorry for me when I'm sick!  And then wait til' she finds out someone stole my wallet.  Luckily my YMCA membership expires at the end of the month, and I had not renewed my library card, I don't care so much about the money but I had more than usual in there cause I was saving it up and was going to put it in the bank when I got the chance.  I got a new learners and my road test is tomorrow and *PLEASE GOD, I PRAY TO YOU HELP ME TO PASS* and I bought a new school ID, and went to the bank and got a new card issued and all that is left is to get a new S.I.N. card.  I didn't realize how important my wallet was to me until it was gone.  And Megz had her Cd's stolen - one of them I know she said was Lord of the Dance.  OK, so like right there that limits it down to a girl cause honestly what kind of guy would want to steal a Lord of the Dance Cd, like really?!?!  I think it might have been Jenna.  I don't want to blame or accuse, but everytime she shows up and then leaves something is always gone!!!  Hmmmm, coincindence - I think not!  And she does Celtic dance, so that would explain why she would want to steal Lord of the Dance.  I don't trust her.  And on Friday during rehearsal she was like "Yeah I think Mr. B keeps candy in his office" so she went into his office and got some candy.  I was thinking 'You have no right to go in there!'  This holiday I am just going to enjoy my food and try to keep under 145.  I keep eating the paska my mom bought and she keeps buying more....ahhhh!  Satuday it's Chinese, then monday Chels and I are going to the White Spot for Breakfast/Brunch and maybe a movie if we have time, but if not then the movie will be another day.  Also I am going from 9-12 on Tues. and Wed. to help put together the set for the play and thurs we are getting together to shop for make-up.  I went to the mall today and finally found some zodiac t-shirts and tanks!  I have been wanting one forever!  Also I got a red sleeveles turtleneck tank think with a black skirt for my sisters Mount Royal grad.  And like EVERYTHING is happening in May.  Like there is the: High School Drama Festival, Sisters Grad, Sisters Wedding, J.H. Performance for Drama, Mid Summer Nights Dream running for four nights.  I am going to have like hardly anytime for studying or anything!  It's gonna be crazy.  tomorrow I just really hope I pass my drivers test.  I have practiced so much and I just want to do something right for once on the first try.
