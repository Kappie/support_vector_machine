Last night I spent several hours at the hospital. Heart was beating so fast and felt a weight on my chest that was pure pain for awhile. Couldnt catch my breath good. My blood pressure was 175/110 when I got there. Several hours later (EKG and blood work and oxygen) it was 156 / 101 (not sure last reading) and with blood work saying I was ok (an irregular heart beat but study) I went home. I was sick one time at the hospital which is another reason they held me there and no one would listen it was due to heat and stress. The hospital room was so hot. I'm out though and doing ok. I have to go to Seatac airport and met my sister this morning for a few hours then I will come home and do nothing. Kids are staying home and will clean the house for me.   I will try to write more later.
