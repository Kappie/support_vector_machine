Well, I must admit that I did promise you I wouldn't tell her, or anyone for that matter. So maybe that was a lie, or just a broken promise. Meh, it happens. But you lied to me when you told me that you told her, and you lied to her when you told her that it wasn't true after I told her the TRUTH. So now she thinks that I am the liar. But you know the truth. And the truth is that it happened. She said she'd forgive you. So why don't you just make it easier for both of us and let it be known. It happened, so just live with it.
