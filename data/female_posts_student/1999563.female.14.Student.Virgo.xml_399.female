Its pretty spiftacular.  Then we decided to walk to target.  So we walked there...I almost got killed by a scary californian driver!! it was freaktacular.  At Target Mandy got a Kelly Clarkson CD and a Freaky Friday book.  Then we walked back.  Amberly had made some yummy pizza so we ate that and started to watch Ever After.  it was a pretty good movie, as far as romance movies go. :)  Then we just wandered around her abode aimlessly and she started to cook her beef.  Then we ate the beef.  Then we went to youth group.  Hahhaa.  I love californians.   Especially ones whose names are Brian and whose last name is that restaurant thats your neighbor.  Haha.  But, alas, I cannot marry Brian Applebee because, according to Mandy, he is a jerkface.  Oh well.   Then we went home and watched the wonderful Sharks game!  they won!  Wahhoo!  Then we went to bed.  And didn't wake up until good friday.  Then I went to San Fransico.  I didn't really like that town.   except for the SUE-WHEAT paul frank store. :)  Its was dirtty and smelly and had lots of street people.   But yeah.  Then we left san fransico and went  to see the golden gate bridge.. wait...that is in san fransico. Oh well!!  It was TOTALLY covered with fog. It was kinda amusing. We couldn't see any of it except for the tippy top.  Haha.  Then we began our drive home.  The End.   Its EASTER!  I got  a SUE-WHEAT belt. It has tennis rackets on it. Its muy gorgeous!  I also got, 2 pairs of sue-wheat earings, some eye shadow, and a lip gloss. What a haul!  I also got muches candy.  Well, I am off to the easter service!  Buh bye ;)  Laura
