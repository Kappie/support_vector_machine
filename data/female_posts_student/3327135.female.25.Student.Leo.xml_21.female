This series so full of suspense that keeps me wanting to watch more of it! My cousin in UK is also watching it and she enjoyed the show as much as I did! :P   I really want to know the story behind that picture with the prostitute. Could it be that   is actually trying to investigate about prostitution ring? And, I think the prostitute probably snatched the bracelet from him when the photo was taken. I also suspect that the rich man (prostitute's husband) probably killed the prostitute. Hehehe.. all these are just speculation. Will have to watch the 5th episode to find out. :P
