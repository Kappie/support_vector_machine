I've been thinking all day, and just random stuff is on my mind, how people these days in our world that we live in people are so pathetic, even me at times. People are becomming selfish more and more each day. Everyone wants the best but its like a race who can get the best the first, and while these people are trying and strugging to get what they want along their path they hurt people that don't deserve to be hurt. It just bothers me when I sit here or I'm out some where watchin how people these days including I are being so selfish. What is this world comming to...I love so many people, and I don't think i show it in any good way, i try my best but sumtimes it seems not good enugh...sumtimes, i feel as if i shouldn't be here, like whut is my use on being here? i get judge in so many ways and seen to do things but sumtimes cant succeed. my question is if love is suppose to be filled with happiness how come to many people get hurt by it? i you think about it...you get hurt anyway...lifes to confusing.. this is all i reelie got to say...  .:unoticed:.
