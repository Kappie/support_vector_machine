Then when i got home at 11, i talked to people also.  All in all, a very exciting night lol.  Is it just me or has the fact thats it summer not really sunken in yet? Am i the only one that feels like we're still in Freshman year? I mean, seriously, its like i woke up one morning for my very first day of high school, then i blinked, 2 years went by and now i'm a junior. Where'd all the time go!?!?!  alright, my muffins that i am cooking are done....  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
