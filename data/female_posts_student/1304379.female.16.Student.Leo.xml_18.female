The one who had fed me, groomed me, cuddled me and picked me up when I was in dire states, was now turning his back on me, like the world did. I had been an orphan since I was born. I witnessed my mother’s cold-blooded murder, a motorcyclist who did not even stop his bike when my mother was jammed onto his wheel. Instead, he parked his bike on the road shoulder, tossed my mother aside and inspected his bloodstained sports wheel. “Damn it!” I heard him shout. I saw the fury in his bloodshot eyes, like that of my mother’s on his sports wheel. I abhorred humans from that day onwards, and decided to make unrest for them by purring loudly in the wee hours of the morning. Insomnia was peanuts in comparison to the pain humans had caused upon fellow felines. I led a nomadic lifestyle from then onwards, which caused me to be involved in lots of sparring as I was always invading territories. Other strays were always picking on me, as they were green with jealousy that I was different from them. I was a rare Singapura cat. On one of my usual territory invasion battles, Zhi Sheng chanced upon me and came to my rescue as he saw that my paws were scratched bare with flesh hanging loose and blood oozing out from the freshly inflicted wound. "He had been dirty, hungry and completely without hope. Now there was a chance of a new life.” I thought to myself. He took me home and named me Tian Ci, which meant “heaven sent”. Zhi Sheng saw to my wounds and was very patient as he showered me with tender loving care. My hatred toward humans was being scraped away everyday bit by bit. However, behind every benevolent man was an unscrupulous wife. Mei Xin was extremely detestable. “Zhi Sheng, get this flea infested furry creature out of my house I beg you!” screamed Mei Xin in displeasure as she raised her hand in irritation and disapproval. She added that according to Old English mythology, I was a witch’s right hand man. What atrocity! She must have watched too much “Sabrina – The Teenage Witch”. Zhi Sheng defended me by exclaiming that I was a prized gem, according to Egyptian mythology. Three months later, Mei Xin and Zhi Sheng were expecting their first child. She was over the moon. She knew at last that it was time for me to go. “Dear, this cat’s feces might contain toxoplasma which can lead to miscarriage. I know it is heart wrenching to see it go. But when it’s time for it to go, it’s time for it to go.” Cried Mei Xin with artificial melancholy. At that moment, I wanted to pounce on her and slit her evil lips into shreds. Zhi Sheng protested and defended me. A decision was reached at last that I was not to be sent to the SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]. Elation filled me and how I yearn to stand up on my hind legs and dance about in triumphant like the way Zhi Sheng danced salsa. "We shall leave him at the void deck. The SPCA would put him to sleep if he is not being adopted within a week.” Uttered Zhi Sheng. Mei Xin nodded in agreement as she claimed that she did not want the SPCA to put me to sleep. However, I could see from her gleaming eyes that all she wanted was to save some petrol.As I lay, stuck in this one metre by one metre box, the world seemed miniscule, like the hearts of self-centered homosapiens. There was melancholy in the wind and sorrow in the grass as I wait to see what fate has planned next for me.
