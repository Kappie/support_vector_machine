Mom suggested we walk the outlet mall and see if I could handle it before the long 3 hour drive to Clarksville for my doctors appointment. I did well but I'm really tried afterwards from all the walking I did. It sucks but atleast its one step closer to goal!   Only thing I can't believe is how rude kids can be! :-( Here I am with a 14 inch cut, 55 staples, a whole on my stomach and my neck -- And they have to point and laugh. I never felt so stupid and awful before. It made me wanna run back to my house and stay here till the weight comes off. Blah.
