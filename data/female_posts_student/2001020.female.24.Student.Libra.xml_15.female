I didn't even really notice how much I was drinking. $1 drinks, how can you resist? I was having a great time, until I realized I had to drive home from Rina's house. F-ing balls. So then I called my ex and he was angry and said that I should stay at his place, although I'm sure it was a huge inconvenience and I'm sure he didn't really want me to. When I got there, it was 1:30 am, yes, I was still drunk as balls, and I was giggly and strange and probably really annoying. I didn't puke in anyone's better or at all, for that matter, but still...I think I was really annoying to him when he just wanted to sleep. Am I a bitch? Does that make me a bitch?  So, well, I'm agonizing over the fact that I'm going to go to law school where the city is virtually the size of my pinky. That freaks me out. I am not originally from the city, so therefore maybe I'm not a "city girl," but I've been living in them for over a year now, and I completely dig it and actually need it. So I'm panicking. I'll be 4 hours from NYC and 4 hours from Montreal and 6 hours from Boston...but still...I'm worried...  That's it. Best be getting back to work. Ugh, grr, boo.
