I kind of doubt that we'll be going to  THE  Splashdown since it's listed as 7 PM and you'd usually go earlier in the day for a trip like that... right? Anyway, get back to me on that one.  I like sitting in parking lots with friends, blasting music at a reasonable level. Then, you turn around and pick up an imitation Oreo off the ground of the car and throw it into the next car where the occupants are surely swapping spit. It's amusing to make fun of them. But of course, we all know people who make fun of PDA'ers are just lonely. Yes, I am lonely. Actually, not really. I have friends to keep me amused. Which makes me wonder. What's up with teenage relationships? Why so much effort? I mean, there's a huge number of married couples who can't make things work, why should teenagers start jumping the bandwagon? This is one of the reasons why I have yet to have a boyfriend. It doesn't bug me though. Enjoy being young. It doesn't last too long. (This isn't to say I wouldn't mind a special someone. I'm just lazy...ish.)  Forget everything you just read. It's late and I don't make sense. Oh yah, LAUREN COMES BACK FROM EUROPE TOMORROW!! Someone enlighten me. Is there a way to write letters to Ben Appenheimer while he is at camp? Or e-mail? Or something?!
