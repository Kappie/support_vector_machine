After reading pgs 23-73 and 178-183 and 1-6 and whatever else, I got to begin Art Law reading, I got through pgs 1-6 and then looked at the assignment in the big book, the first chapter, and wondered again why I am in law school? I think these questions surface more frequently on school nights after 10 pm.     Alot of people are going to Rome, including C. I was invited, but hey I had been there in June, so no I am not going. What might you ask am I going to do? Well, besides read for Int'l Crim law, I don't really know. Schools out for the weekend as of tomorrow and I am without plans. If I stay in innsbruck I am convinced I'll be the only one left behind, so that would suck, but what should I do other than that? I want to go to Prague really, really badly, but another horrendous train ride just sounds very unappealing. 22 more pgs to read, wait no, 21.5 more.
