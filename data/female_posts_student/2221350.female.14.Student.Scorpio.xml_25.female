When she was around me before, she never seemed to eat much and I wondered why she was so overweight, but this weekend at her apartment I learned why. We had three huge meals on Saturday and from the sounds of it, that's what she always does.  Needless to say I won't be doing much but guzzling the water/diet coke and putting a little more oomph in my volleyball playing this week. I checked the scales and was absolutely shocked! How could I have gained three pounds in two nights and a day!? Kelsey is one of those people who is freakishly nice, but you can tell that everything she does is done with the purest of good intentions. It's not often you find someone like that, and this is just the bastardofwesterncivilization talking, but I think her niceness makes her seem lacking in depth... Or maybe she's just good at hiding her feelings? Or maybe her Mormon farmer upbringing has truly produced a person of that nature. Who knows...  This week was tough. School is killing me, my mom is still on shaky ground((I think?!?)), and for some reason I am in one of those -I need to stick my lip out as far as it will go and pout until I'm blue in the face- kind of moods, but as of late I don't have time to feel anything, I only have time for homework, laundry, chores, and sneaking in bits of blogging. My monologue is due tomorrow, and I haven't typed one word of it. I have found wonderful ways of avoiding writing it like cleaning out the desk, cleaning the keyboard, burning a couple of CD's, looking for the system of a down CD I lost last summer, cleaning out my wardrobe and making a pile to give to goodwill, and eating the middle of a leftover cinnamon roll. I hate Ms. Morehead((I like to call her Ms. moredead)) and I hate her retarded off the wall assignments that aren't doing anything but stressing me out and making me insane. And HOW am I going to put my education to good use and succeed in life if I am insane?!?!? Did she ever think of THAT?  You know, this is what I was thinking of on Friday, I call it the typical highschool trainwreck. I can't stand up straight for my heavy backpack, short breaks have got my digestion screwed((it's true, on Friday I scarfed a lunch so fast I thought I would puke, I had to eat quick so I could go to the library and work on research since the teacher wouldn't let me go do it in HER class)), the bus gives me a headache, and I've got hours of homework to do every night and on weekends.   I don't think it's ok to put so much stress on a teenager, we're still trying to develop ideals like "life is worth living even if it sucks and I shouldn't kill myself" and "I shouldn't do drugs to escape from my own existence even if it is my existence that is so putrid and horrific". And of course there is that whole "these are the best years of your lives" thing when in fact, the best years of our lives are the ones we can't remember living and that stupid mantra is total bullshitt and our lives will only get exponentially worse by the day until we get so fed up that we just die.  I have spread the joy of blogging to yet another one of my friends. I think she's having trouble figuring out blogger though. Check tiffany's blog on the links in a couple days when she's got it set up nicely.  This weekend when I didn't have internet I was physically ailing for blogger. It's like some kind of drug, blogging, kind of scary. So I wrote down everything I was feeling like in a notebook and I'm going to copy it in here:  Post for Friday, January 9:  Today I saw a shirt that said "ROCK IS DEAD" and underneath that in small letters it said "Long Live Paper and Scissors!" I thought it was hilarious.  In world history we watched a show about the ancient Mayans ((movie day! haha Emily)), what amazing people they were. Today their lunar charts are only off by 33 seconds and they knew things about astrological happenings from 2000 years before. They predict that the end of the world will be December 23, 2012. Wouldn't that be interesting if they were right and the world as we know it was over in 8 years? But I guess it wouldn't matter if it were interesting or not since we'd be kind of... Oblivion.   Mom's been reading my blog and I really wish she wouldn't, hopefully this post will get the message across to her to "STOP READING MY BLOG, THERE IS A REASON I CHANGE THE ADDRESS SO MUCH YOU NOSY LICHEN!" is lichen to strong of a word to use against my mother, oh well, she's called her mother worse.  The Aristocats are coming to the Marjorie Lyons playhouse here in Shreveport!!! That is one of the best shows ever! Plus my friend destin got the part of Thomas o' Malley, the alley cat. I only hope I can find someone to go with me.       Well that's it for the Friday post. I left out a bunch of whining crap, I'm too lazy to type it in and it wasn't important anyway.   Post again before I get kicked off tonight.
