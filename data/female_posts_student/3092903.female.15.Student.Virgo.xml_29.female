Rachel and Sara spent the night last night. We watched Drive Me Crazy at 4 in the morning. The guys came over to kill the raccoons. Didn't I write about those raccoons in my profile? I remember because that night they were scratching at the door. They are scary little things. But anyway, they didnt come last night, but I'm going to start setting them up for DEATH. hehehehehe. Well I thik I'm going to go eat lunch and get ready to go so I can go buy a new bathing suit.
