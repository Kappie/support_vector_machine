Obviously I didnt get either of those right, as I had a lot of fun, and everyone was in tears. Oh, and an added bonus was how FREAKING HOTT THE DJ WAS. O.M.G.   You guys- I'm seriously scared about graduation. I cried during my last class, the slideshow is gonna kill me.   Yesterday we collected shoes. Great turn out actually- Im thinkin 1500 pairs or so. Go ALison! hahaha. And now my carriage house smells like old shoes since they're all up there.   Exams tomorrow... and the rest of the week. I'm so unmotivated to study for any of these test- with exception of maybe SS. OMG! I think LHS may reject me... aahhhhhhh, were will I go to school? jkjkjk  ASSATEAGUE IN A WEEK! Rock on. Hahah.  I'm out. GOtta get ready for soccer game in spotsylvania. We're gonna beat the spirit... I mean- even though we have 11 players (if we're lucky) and one of our goalies has internal bleeding in one ear and can't hear out of it for 2 and a half months... and chelsea is in a cast. Hmmmm- we'll see how this goes  "If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of, I will let you down" -NineDays
