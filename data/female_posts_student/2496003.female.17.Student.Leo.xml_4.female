And it's crazy, but Ashley and I have the same problem ... we let the anger fester when we don't see them, and then when we do get the chance to talk to them, all the bad mojo flies out the window. Andy's pretty smile has that effect on me. Haha maybe I should put up walls made of tougher stuff if that's all it takes to knock them down. I am, however, keeping the monkey I got for him.        Ahhh! I got to talk to Kyle today! I missed talking to him, he was one of my favorite people at lunch every day. And in the band room, you know, when I wandered around everydayduring third period (thank God Mr. Davidson never turned me in, for all the times he caught me). He updated me on all of the people I've been to busy to talk to: Travis, Chris, Ben. Haha I was a little off on the Jess and Ben betting, but oh well. I tried. Ben has a little more self-control than I expected. It's kind of sad, I wanted to be the one to deflower him, hahaha!!!        Party at my house in the beginning of August!        Love, hugs, and kisses,    Your Sweetest b.
