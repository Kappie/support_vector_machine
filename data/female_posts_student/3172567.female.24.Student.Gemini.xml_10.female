After a few more incidents, (including one where I cussed the child out)the "Lauren situation" is over with.  I had to practically lose sanity directly on her head, but I did it.  I had to threaten to call the cops, threaten to beat her ass and talk to her mother about controlling her, but it is all over with.  I made a B and a C in my 2 Maymester classes.  The B I am proud of because I didn't study, the C I am expecially proud of because I didn't even buy the book for that class.   Now, the event that is on the horizon is my moving out and living on my own.  Joel has thrown out the idea of taking a break.  What kind of break, you ask...I don't know.  He wants a break, but he doesn't want a break up.  He doesn't want to date anyone else, but he just wants to do his own thing for a while.  I pack up my stuff, and he unpacks it.  I tell him I'm looking at apartments, and he gets all upset.  He says he didn't think things all the way through before he said something to me. You know, I just don't understand, either.  If it weren't for my job and school and life in general, I would just pack it all up and go keep Karen company in Statesboro after Mike leaves.  Joel is absolutely driving me nuts.  Well, that's the quick update.  I promise, promise, promise I'll be a little better about keeping this thing up.
