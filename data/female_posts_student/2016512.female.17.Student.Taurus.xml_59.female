We even had a little cast party. Horray for Kaida's massages! That was definately the highlight of the evening for myself.  other news- i had dance competition this past weekend in downtown Minneapolis. We got to stay at the Hilton. ooh aah swank! it was fun. the lobby looked like the taghmahal of all lobbies. sadly, the rooms were nothing special but it worked just fine. when i got there i saw MD himself. no joke, and then i saw many other egf people. i talked to duck footed and he said they were all there for some men's chior thing and they were staying at the hilton too. interesting...sadly i never saw them again after that but oh well it was wierd enough running into them like that.   the competition itself was not so good. the judges seemed to love one specific company and it got old real fast. they didn't really know how to judge musical theater so some of our dances didn't do so well. i did think the judging was fair though. oh well  there was also a workshop. i'm so sore because of it. my knees are bruised, i have big muscles in my arms, and my back is in wretched amounts of pain. the classes consisted of lyric/jazz, jazz, jazz/hip hop, and hip hop. if you thought i sucked at hip hop before think again. now it just proves the point that i REALLY suck at hip hop. this workshop was a lot better than dance olympus. i actually liked the dances. yay 10 points for that. and now i can't get them out of my system. i think they'll be there for awhile.
