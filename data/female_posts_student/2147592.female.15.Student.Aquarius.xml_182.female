It was quite amusing though when Sam admitted that he had never heard of Nirvana... Second lesson was english, I dragged Lettie along, it was pretty poopy. At break me, Lettie and Clur went down Spar, it was cool us all chatting, Lettie was saying how she would throw a massive party if I lost my virginity... Third lesson was science, it was poopy, nice to see Kristie back though :| Fourth lesson was p.e. It was quite amusing, and I can't believe how my ctaching skills have grown :|...I'm a natural :|, Miss said I was insane... At lunch I went down Lettie's I broke up a "disagreement" as Larny's ex boyfriend had text her saying something about her current boyfriend being a paedophile, backstabbing ugly bastard...I had to try to convice Mark not to kick the shit out of him. Last lesson was maths, it was turd. I got a lift home with Frankie, then I worked for two hours. I never realised what a shithole I live in...oh well. That is all, I need a fag :( Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxx
