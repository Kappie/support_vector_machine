I'm just a pinch of nothing This isn't really me  You tell me that I'm beautiful But if you only knew How grotesque I truly am How desperately untrue  What does it mean to be beautiful? I'm not the word at any rate Some say it means to be a star Good looking, glamorous, and great  Why do you think I'm beautiful? What is it that you see? If want to dig deep, then when I'm asleep I'm just the little old me  Oh no, I am not beautiful Not outside, and not in It's an uphill battle with myself And I can't ever win
