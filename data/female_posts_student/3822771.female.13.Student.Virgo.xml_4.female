So instead of going to practice i went down to blue springs, missouri, with mymom, sisters, and brother (eric) around twelve. We hung out with my aunt, uncle, and cousins that live down there. At seven we went to a play that they were in, The Music Man (Gregs favorite!!) It was awesome, just like the movie, then we went back to their house (its 11:00 by now) and sat outside and my uncle played the guitar, and we just sat outside, listened, to music, and taled until about 3:00, then we all came inside, and talked for a while...again, then we eventually went to bed. we all woke up arouond 12:00 the next day, my family ate and then had to leave right away. We got about half way home and our car broke down, so we ahd to sit near the side of the road until my dad got there (about two an a half hours later) we funaly got home, and i was so tired i just went to bed. The next morning i had to wake up at 7:00 A.M. for our 3v3 soccer tournament in lincoln. When we got to lincoln it was raining and only about 65 degrees outside. It was NOT fun to play soccer in that weather! We lost our first game, 4-3 against Xplosion (we shoulda won that though) and then we won our second game against the Stingers (what a name) 4-2. and then we played tropical storm (a council bluffs team) 5-4.we only played three games saturday...thank youo god! Sunday i had to wake up even earlier, 6:30 A.M. We got to Lincoln around 8:oo, our first game was at 8:30 against the elk ice, we won 3-0, our second game against the hot shots was seriously a miracle, i have no idea how we won that game (3-2) So now we made it to the championship game, against the Stingers again....We played pretty well the first half, it was only 1-1 at halftime, the second half we came out and sucked! we they scored two goals right away...so now the score is 3-1, them...but some how we manage to get a couple break aways and score off them...and got it back to 3-3, and then with about 20 seconds left, i get a break away, one on one, and miss the goal by the two inches! So we went into overtime. Luckily we got kickoff, we dribbled it up right away, took a shot and it bounced off their defender and so we got a corner, liz took the corner, it bounced of their defender again, so liz got to take the corner again. This time it it went right past their defnder across to the other side, they almost got it (for a break away) but some how i ended up with the ball, i took a shot, it hit the bar and came back towards me i kicked it again, it hit the feet of their defender, i get the ball again, this time i shoot, and finally score!! So we won, 4-3 in overtime, yah for us, so then we go get our medals, and pictures, and then we all decide to go out to eatat some restaurant in omaha, and me and my dad are driving away, when i spill some ice cream on my medal, and jersey, and im looking at my medal and it said third place! i was like "Wait a minute, we did get first place right?" and so my dad went and talked to michelle, everyone else's said first, so we went back to the fields, and got be a first place medal...lol..then we went to eat...yadda yadda yadda...i am really sore today! so that was my weekend, it was really fun!!...
