Friday night, me and elizabeth went to the rodeo, we were on the ground RIGHT in front of Trace Adkins when he performed!, its was funn!!, then I saw Josh, and he wanted us to go to the dance after it, but we decided that we would wait until sat. night! so me and Eliz and Jessica, went back to elizabeth's house and spent the night, and David B. got Elizabeth's number from jessica, so we got her a man! hehe!! he's a sweetheart!!.. so Saturday (..Valentine's day... mine and Justin's anniversary...) anyways... well it was already not such a great day to start with, but then it got better... but it was back down hill at the end of that night!... We get to the rodeo... and I haven't heard from Josh, well i saw him but it was from a distance so I couldn't like go talk to him or anything... but a lil while later he found where we were sitting and came and sat with me!, then we went down to the floor when Jeff Bates performed! (that poor guy, he was TeRrIbLe, like hardly anyone cheered for him, it was sooo sad, but me and elizbaeth were like jumping up and down and screamin to make him feel loved).. so Josh's phone rings in the middle of that and it was come girl and he said it was just one of his friends... blah blah blah, so i was all in a pissy mood! and I was real short with him and everything! so after the rodeo he was like well 'I'm about to go ahead and go over to the dance, are you coming?' and I was like 'yea i guess in a lil bit' and he was like 'ok, i'll see you in a minute'.. so like 30 min. later we go over there and there were soooooo many people there!!, it was unreal! but anyways, so me and elizabeth and david b. run into Orin and are talkin or whatever! and then we see Josh, and he's like giving me all these ugly looks, like I was there WiTh orin or something (not that i would have minded, lol, he's fineee!, haha j/k), but anyways, so I was already mad at him, so i wasn't about to go up and try and make things better, so I didn't and he was mad, cause I was talkin to a friend (i mean since that is soooo wrong and everything)... but anyways so me and him and that whole situation went a Big.. NO WHERE!!, but it was pretty much pointless to begin with cause he lives in lucedale!!, but anyways, he is sweet and VERYYYYY HOTT!! but its all good, there are plenty more out there!, I didn't really see that so-called relationship going anywhere!, well I didn't think about Justin much on Valentine's!, which is kinda surprising!, I figured I would have!, I dreaded Valentines' soo bad, but I mean it really wasn't that badd, i know the whole Josh thing didn't turn out very well in the end, but we still had funn the time we did spend together!, he's a nice guy, but it just wouldn't have worked out!! but anyways... moving on... Sunday night me and Elizabeth and Dana went to Margarita's! it was soo good!.. then we went to Brenton's house and saw him and Jarrod!, then Eliz stayed at my house!, and Monday we didn't have school!, so I went to Clinton and met up with Julie and we went to Wal-mart, then we went to Matt's and saw him, Jarrod, and Brenton! I felt like crap all day!! well, i wake up today and I thought I was dying!, my wisdom teeth are coming in and they hurt EXTREMELY bad!, but thats the least of my problems!, mom insists on taking me to the doctor!, and I have Strep! is that great or what?.. well I'm all for gettin some medicine and going home, but nooo, I'm just 'sooo sick' I MUST have a freakin shot!!.... ugh!!!!!!!!.. i mean you might as well shoot me, before you give me a shot! I'm the BIGGEST chicken when it comes to that stuff!!! i just can't handle it, well anyways... it gets worse!!... so after the shot!, they decide that I probably have Mono too, so after they stab me once, the lil nurse comes back in there ready to draw blood to test it to see if I have Mono too!... so yea my day SUCKKED!!!... but anyways, i feel a little better! my teeth hurt worse than anything!, I can't eat anything! I've lost 4 pounds!! I weigh 106 now! .. but anyways, I think I've talked long enough about absolutly nothing important or anything that you wanted to know about!! so I'm gone! we'll holla!~*
