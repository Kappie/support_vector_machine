I woke up at 5 that morning. I just did. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I started reading until it was 7 I fell back asleep. I had to wake up at 8. So I slept about 5 hours that day. I had to go to school to finish painting the banner and making the "ticket" box for our gradutaion. After doing all that I went home ate lunch and waited till it was 2. I went to my hair place where they did all these loopy things. They put way to much makeup on me I started to freak out. Right when I got into the car I wiped all or almost all the makeup I had on me. I put on my dress and was on my way to Graduation. I was a little late and when I was there all my friends were there to greet me. They were all screaming "OMG ALICE". So that was a scary moment there for me. It took a while before we walked down the aisle. My feet were already killing me so much. I thought I was going to collaspe any time soon. When I walked down the aisle with Shokur I saw Ms McKenzie. My grade 5 teacher. She was the best. She was really tough but taught me a lot about studies, but also about life. I didn't feel very confident. I felt upset though. I was scared I wasn't going to make my parents proud. I know they'll say that as long as I try my best, but honestly I know that they would prefer me to win something, or that particular award that everyone was saying I would get. I just didn't have that confidence though. When the awards were given out I was nervous. The science award was introduced and me and Jacqueline won it. I was disappointed. I don't really know why.   The ceremony was over and parents were taking pictures and were off back home, while their kids were ready to party off. I didn't feel so excited. I could almost say throughout the whole time I didn't feel anything. I kept on tripping over my dress. At least I didn't fall. I saw Safee. I didn't talk to him. Everyone was having fun. You can see it in their faces. I felt happy for them. Safee came up to me and we just walked about awards, how everything was going. It wasn't exactly like before. Obviously. I didn't expect it to be. I realized that he didn't love me when he said he did. Love, is a complicating word. A word where it means you're willing to do anything. A word where you mean it as long as you live. A word of eternity. I know of course that grade 8 love can't possibly stay till we're 100 or so, but to me, some how, it did. And I thought he did too. No matter what he had in the past. I had faith in him. I had trust in him. A couple hours passed and it was over. Graduation was over. I felt nothing. Just the feeling of being with my friends. Honestly, that didn't even make me like myself. During the slow dances I would usually walk alone outside. Just looking at the rain. I didn't want to bring my memories back. I didn't want to cry.  Today, was the same old. We got our yearbooks today. There was a little problem. It had the spirals when we ordered not to have them. But we can't do anything about it. We handed them out and started writing our feelings about the following years and how we're going to be so nervous for high school. I received two yearbooks. One for me, and one for Safee. When we were going out, I knew he didn't order a yearbook so I ordered one for him. I wanted him to know that this year was really special to me, and I thought it to be for him. I wanted him to remember grade 8. When I got my yearbook I didn't know whether I should still give it to him or not. I sort of just stared at it. I guess I'll see in the last day of school. Yasi told me that he got a yearbook. I was confused because he never ordered one. Then she checked and he didn't order but he still got yearbook. Mistakes. When she got it back from him it already had autographs in them. She said if I was still planning to get one for him I should sign my name in his yearbook that already had it's autograph. I didn't know what to do so I just said, it doesn't matter. She said she would tell him to pay the 20 dollars for his yearbook. Later she said he changed his mind. I said, "but it already has writing on it, we can't return it" I was confused. I think now he doesn't have a yearbook. I don't know.   Nima said he had to talk to me. I walk walking home and so was he so I said that we'd talk then. But then I saw my dad. So I said sorry to Nima and went. Then I thought, "Am I stupid or what? Offer you're best friend, who lives across the street from you, if he wants a ride". It was sort of like a slap in the face for being so dumb. He didn't finish writing in my yearbook so I told him to keep it over night and to give it back on thursday, since tomorrow is Ontario Place.  I just remembered that I don't even have a bathing suit. My got to small. Poor me. It doesn't matter much since I don't like swimming, water stuff. Maybe just the rides though, they're fun. Wonderland on the 26th. I don't think I'm ever going to be back to my normal self. Either I'm maturing into a sad person or I'm still thinking about everything that's happening...
