I missed dinner tonight, so please forgive me any... random bizarreness-osity.  Tonight, dear children, we have a study on different doctor's (or perhaps just males in general's) personalities.  It won't be a long lesson, or I'm likely to eat this plastic model of a brain sitting in front of me.  Mmmmm...I love me some cerebellum...  I was down in the ED (I'm on call tonight, and that is the cool place to be)  Guess who else was there?  No, wrong.  It was FNIB.  But, see...I didn't realize FNIB was there until at least 20 minutes had passed.  This was because FNIB was stuck in the shadow of a BJ.  Yes, folks, a BJ.  "What," you ponder queryingly, "is a BJ?"  Well.  Let me edu-mi-cate y'all.  A BJ is a "Beautiful Jerk."  This is a male that is quite objectively...  beautiful.   There is really no other description.  I despise the usage of "hot."  I like my sauce hot, and my coffee hot, but not people.  That just cheapens it.  But I digress.  Like Dr. Ober, which is why, I think, he's one of the coolest people I've ever had as a teacher.  However, he is not a BJ, and that is the subject of tonight's ramble.  BJ.  It does not matter his true identity, for all he will ever be is a BJ.  Objectively beautiful.  The jerk part is just something that you feel emanating off of some people.  He may be the nicest person in the world, but he will always be a BJ.  He just is.  So deal with it.  BJ swaggers around the ED.  He has no goal in mind.  I know, because I'm sitting there, doing nothing, and my eyes just naturally follow him.  That's part of the BJ-ness.  I watch him, even though he's basically just making laps around the ED.  FNIB wanders aimlessly around the ED.  He, also has no goal in mind, but this is obvious to absolutely everyone who even glances at him.  I try to watch what he's doing (because I'm still sitting there, doing nothing), but I keep losing him, even though he's basically just making laps around the ED.  As an aside - there is also a consumptive poet (male) wandering around the ED masquerading as a doctor.  I don't know where he came from, but if this guy does not stand in the moonlight serenading a beautiful woman standing on a balcony sometime in his life, there is something wrong with the world.  I may have more BJ vs. FNIB comparisons to make, but right now my mouth is full of neoprene basal ganglia.  Darn it all to hockey sticks.  FEED ME.
