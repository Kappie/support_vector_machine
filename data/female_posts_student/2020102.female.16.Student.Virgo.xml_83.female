Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.  Chandler: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.  -Friends  Susie: Uh, is your name Chandler?  Chandler: Uh, yes, yes it is.  Susie: Chandler Bing?  Chandler: Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?  -Friends  Phoebe: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.  Joey: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.  Chandler: How do you not fall down more? -Friends
