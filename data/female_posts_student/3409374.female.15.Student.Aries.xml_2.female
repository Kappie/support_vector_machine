Tell me about it. -__-' Yay...tomorrow is mahler concert and R's surprise birthday party...hope she gets surprised...or else what's the point of it. I'm missing out on all the great movies...always fully booked...can't watch shrek2 or troy, cos that day when my frens are going, i'm supposed to do mountain-climbing...nvm...anything for nature! At least it's much healthier than sitting in a dark room stuffing urself with popcorn. HeeX. Drawing diagrams for physics is really getting on my nerves and i can't imagine what the MEP camp would be like. We would all be dancing like elephants..haha...and with guys, i think that's even worse. They'll probably step on our feet, and we would probably step on theirs. Haha...an eye for an eye *evil grin* Sigh...i dun feel like doing anything right now...so bye :)
