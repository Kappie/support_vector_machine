I saw this movie yesterday and I feel it is my duty to the fans of this site and to fans of the cinema to tell people about this movie. A wild ride that is a brilliant piece of film making.  Watching his team's opponents soar above the soccer field like caped superheroes, Sing (Shephen Chow) gasps "it must be special effects!" This is the just the thing that makes this movie so great, this little inside joke, coming near the end of the movie, that's as thick with cheesy CGI as it is with infectious silliness. Welcome to   Shaolin Soccer  , director/star Stephen Chow's amazingly light-hearted spoof that truly lives up to its ad slogan "Get ready to kick some grass."  Now this movie was actually made in 2001, but Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein delayed bringing it over for three and a half years, and then when he did, he decided to release it to less than 100 screens. I am truly disappointed that more people won't see this movie. It doesn't take itself seriously, it is a one of a kind masterpiece that I would recommend anyone to see. Whether you like foreign films or not, whether you like kung fu movies or not, whether you like soccer or not.  The movie follows Sing as he joins up with older, disgraced soccer hero Golden Leg (Ng Man Tat) and rounds up his old friends and fellow Shaolin kung fu students to apply their martial arts moves to the playing field. The "brothers" from his old dojo are a specialized crew currently down on their luck. Iron Head has, well, a blow-proof noggin. Iron Shirt has the ability to trap a soccer ball in the force-field of his stomach. Little Brother is a tubby bear of a fellow, who nevertheless can float like a balloon when he jumps. And so on, you get the idea.  In a sweet subplot, Sing meets Mui (Vicki Zhao), who makes steamy buns at a food stand using the fine art of Tai Chi kung fu. She's painfully shy and mortified by her bad facial acne, but starts to come out of her shell when Sing, seeing her inner self, insists she's beautiful.  The main course of   Shaolin Soccer   is a series of soccer matches that leads these chopsocky players toward an ultimate showdown with Team Evil, run by the rich, corrupt Hung (Patrick Tse Yin), the guy responsible for ruining Golden Leg's career (and his golden leg) 20 years earlier. Naturally, his Evil players are juiced on illegal designer dope, allowing Hung to gloat, "Those American drugs are better than I expected!" The soccer matches are gravity-defying spectacles, with balls kicked so hard they turn into blazing meteorites. The scenes are completely unbelievable and completely enjoyable. There's something ingratiating about the casual cheesiness of the computer-generated effects. At not quite 90 minutes, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome for one second (when I knew it was about to end I thought to myself "no it can't be over already." And it packs quite a lot of stuff into that brief running time: a recurrent joke about slipping on a banana peel, glances at Sing's adoration of Bruce Lee, even a sudden song-and-dance number in the street, set to "Celebration."    Shaolin Soccer   is a major cause for celebration, it's genial goofiness is so endearing you can't help but fall in love with it. It is the most entertaining movie I have seen in the last four years, and probably the best.   Grade: A+
