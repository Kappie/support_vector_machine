And we took a tour of the school and i saw were my classes were.....and francesca dont worry, i stuck out too, but i talked with a few people, then moved on. oh ya and we had seniors give us the tour but before we left the classroom they asked 'well are you guys excited about the new year?' and we're all like shrugging our shoulders and saying'not reallllly' lol they were like 'cmon guys your freshman that should be exciting.'---ya we're freshman thats exactly why we're not excited lol.but i signed up for Ram Page which is the school newspaper....i'll probably feel like cooper from The Days if anyone saw the last episode. and yep, i got acting...so im happy about that...something alil new. okay well im gonna go....i havent gotten my bag yet for school....im getting like a roxy messenger bag, i love messenger bags...they're more fun.
