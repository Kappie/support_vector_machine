Everyone I talked to said they felt something coming.  Since nothing much ever happens here, the local news was having a fit about it, throwing up pictures of radar and safety warnings and recorded calls of old ladies reporting possible twisting formations they saw from their kitchen windows.  A tornado can kill you.  It can take away your possessions.  It can pull down the walls around you but leave your cup unspilled on your coffee table.  But all we got was rain, which in some perverse way disappointed me.  I want to be stripped of everything sometimes.  I am poor with day to day trivialities and I am slightly socially inept-- I am not punctual.  But I am good in  danger.    It rained harder than it has in years.  The last time it rained like that was the year I ran away from home, can it really be six years ago?  I remember at the time I thought it was a sign.  (I have always been strangely religious for an atheist.)  It rained until the streets looked like rivers.  It was practically Biblical.  I moved here with my best friends from my hometown, and we always did bizarre things just to be doing bizarre things.  It rained so much that we gave up on being dry and just walked around outdoors in our bathing suits.  I was lonesome and estranged from my family, and I was officially a high school dropout.  If I stopped being silly long enough to acknowledge these facts, I would feel a big windy hole in my chest.  (And thunder ripping above me all the while.)  But in the end the sun came out.  I am sure I missed out on a lot of good things in doing what I did, but since I'll never know what I missed, I feel fine.  (The road not taken, I suppose.)  My man was acting kind of weird last night.  We made cookies for my roommate, which was a disaster and not even worth the headache...We had to leave some of them in the oven while we helped contain our friend's cats and hide out while the storm was on.  They turned hard and brown in our absence.  And then she came home-- No love there, we're still in the doghouse for reasons I am losing patience with.    But my man...I thought something was wrong and it made me nervous.  We drove about in the rain, and when we hit campus, I started getting nostalgic about the last time we had a good rain.  I said, Let's go outside!  And there we were, running knee deep through rainwater, with cold drops pelting us so I couldn't stop shrieking from the excitement.  Lightning lit up the sky.  I hope nothing's wrong.  I hope it's not, because in spite of myself, I am all tangled up.  In ways, love is like letting someone hold a blade to your throat.  I have to believe he won't cut me.  But even the slightest thing makes me worry that he will.  I know I am wrong, and that it's probably nothing, and it's unfair to make him pay for what others have done to me.  Gun-shy girl slept alone last night.  Today begins my project of self denial.  I put it so dramatically, but the bottom line is I am going on a diet.  I ate my hundred calories this morning and I packed my apple for lunch...I felt so miserable and the hunger pains haven't even started yet.  But I've put on a few and I've been wearing big fat man's pants and the last time I saw a photograph of myself, I said "Who the hell is that?  So it begins today...
