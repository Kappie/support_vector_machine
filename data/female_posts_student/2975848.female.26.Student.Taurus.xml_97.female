Don’t ask me how. Don’t ask me to stop, What I can’t control  I’m just a girl who feels too much. Maybe that’s the way to my doom. I just know, that’s my Cross I’ll carry, till the end of my days.  I just want your happiness Even if I’m not a part of it.  Where ever you may go, I'll be here, always for you. What ever you may need I’ll be here, always for you.  I'll never forget you. I'll never forsake you.  You will always have a special place in my heart.  ]-[ellMistress
