I mean, she sayd it's nothing, but, it is something,.. it's bothering her, and, as a friend I'm supposed to be there for her.  But that's the thing,.. I've been such a bad friend to everyone lately, especially to the one I know I should be paying more attention to, and to the one who's always been there for me, even when I was a brat and deserved no one.  I feel bad for letting this friendship die, and I know that I can take full responsibility for that.  I read her journal,.. and, I don't know what to say to it.  I know she's feeling crummy, but I don't know what to say anymore.  I'm scared that if I open my mouth to say anything to her, I might make her mad... and, I've done that all too much.  I just wish I could be a better friend to her, like I know I  should  be.  And, I know that lately, I've been selfish,... I've been spending all my time with my bf, and I've been neglecting her, when that's the last thing I'd ever want to do... altho, I guess it doesn't really seem that way at all.  A great friend I am, huh?  Repaying the one who deserves the most, but treating her so horribly.  I'm surprised she still is my friend.  I owe so much to her,.. and, I know that I haven't sayd it lately.. and, I don't say it enough... but, she's the one I need to thank for so much.  She's done so much for me, and I don't deserve any of it.  I'm so outta the loop now, that I don't even know what's going on in her life.. and, I call myself her best friend.  Man,... I do feel horrible,... and, nothing's going to change that,... because, I AM horrible... and, that's the truth... there's nothing more to it.  I couldn't be more of a horrible friend... agh,... I'm sorrie...
