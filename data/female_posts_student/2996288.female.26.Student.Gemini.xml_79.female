For psyche, we can call ahead of time to request what team we want to be on.  I thought about doing this, to try to ensure that I would not be on a team with MMPWHM.  But, I also was thinking that I should at least pretend to be an adult, and just let what happens happen...  Today, I joined forces with two non-MMPWHM and we decided to call to request things after all.  And guess what.  We had already been assigned.  And guess - just guess - who I was paired with??  Yup.  The biggest MMPWHM there is.  Awful.  Thankfully, we were able to pull a switch, and I will now be with a non-MMPWHM.  How horrendously awful a month with that person would have been is beyond me.  I'd have had a nervous breakdown, I just know it.  Because I still seem to be the only one of all of us involved that is affected by it.  I guess it is easier to dump a friend than to be the dumpee.  I feel like I narrowly missed death.  Question: how stable do you think a relationship is between a CCU nurse and a new second year resident that has existed for... less than 7 months, when she was (within the last year) previously dating a fellow?  Not that I'd try to break it up or anything...  I'm not the devil - I don't care what anyone says otherwise!!
