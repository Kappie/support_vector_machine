I remember holding you in my arms even to this day how small and tiny you were. Then you begun to grow and you brought a constant smile to my face even when you were bad because of how you always made it seem like a joke. It's been 7 long years sense I last saw you and I cry for you daily even when no one sees me. Today is going to be hard on me. My sweet angel boy how I long to be able to see you just to make sure you are ok. My perfect dream would be you would want to be with me but I know the lies you have been told. I remember 6 years ago when I last heard that angelic voice of yours "You gave me away becuase you dont love me, daddy told me so and so I dont love you no more Jeannie is my real mommy now not you" and then you slammed the phone down and I cried so hard I thought my heart would explode. Oh baby if only you knew the truth, if only you knew how much I did love you and how much you do mean to me. I have worried about you each day wondering if you were ok and alive. I promised myself so long ago when I let go of the hate and hurt that your daddy caused me that I would never let a cross word go against him if you were around so I will not write it here for one day I hope to be able to see you. My heart, you are my love and I can not even tell you how much you mean to me. I love you my youngest sweet son. I will as always say a prayer that you are safe and I will ask the Gods above to watch over you and care for you and I will ask the Goddess to kiss you good night as always with a little extra for it being your birthday. I long to be the one kissing you good night. I miss you so much I hurt.
