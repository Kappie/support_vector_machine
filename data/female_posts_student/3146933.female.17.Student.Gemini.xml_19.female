I just wish I knew what I did to him...to make him act this way towards me. And...I wish...that we could hang out more...I'm so tired of wishing that it'll happen though. If he still wants to hang out more when I get back from Pensacola, hang out more is what we will totally do. I like Brad. He's a ... pretty cool guy. ;) Brad Brad Brad... I saw *him* tonight! Aw, I was so excited. He'll miss me...he said so himself. :D Wow, I feel loved. Really. *HUG* I'm going to Pensacola here in a little while today...pretty excited. I hope I get to go shoppin' and meet people (mostly guys!) while I'm down there...be nice...but whoa..I really need a tan. Very bad. Anyway, we get schedules soon...I hope all goes well with that. Oh and we need to get my senior pix portfolio! Ahh! *excited*...well I'll write more later maybe..I'm pretty tired. That is..if I can get to a computer down in Pensacola! :O :D
