Magazine:    People     Photo:   camera    Concert:   music    Video:   killed the radio star    Pass:   backstage!    Ticket:   master    Line:   dance    Excitement:  fun!      Are you warmed up yet? That's good, cos the Mambo Guy is getting impatient. He wants to get his mambo going on. So let's get started.     1. If you had backstages passes to the show of your chosing, who would it be, and what would you do once you were backstage? (Try to be clean.)  B  ackstage with The Cure, and I would ask Robert Smith who does his makeup!     2. What entertainment magazines do you read?    People, US Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone     3. Do you read concert/album reviews in your local newspaper? And if so, do you let the review sway your opinion on the band/album?   No, because the main reviewer of our city's newspaper never really has something nice to say about anyone except for Lucinda Williams.    4. Create your dream concert lineup. (a sort of Lollapalooza event of your making).   Oh, geez. There are millions. Jet, the Cure, Coldplay, the Eagles, the Steve Miller Band, Journey, Van Halen (Hagar, not Roth), Duran Duran, Def Leppard, Allison Moorer, Shelby Lynne, Aimee Mann...    5. If you could have attended any festival show at any time...From Woodstock on...which one would it have been, and why?   I wouldn't have minded going to Lilith Fair when it was still around, but I was too young at the time to go. Chicks rule!    I love to Mambo!!!!
