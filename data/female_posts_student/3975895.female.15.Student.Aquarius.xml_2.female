It's  not   fun , and I want to get off. Sometimes, I just don't know why i'm feeling down. Trust me, it's not pmsing. It's just everytime I see certain things, or realizes certain things, it makes me upset. Maybe I should stop looking and thinking 'bout it, maybe I'll be better off? But I don't want to. I feel  invisible .
