Little lady don't let them see you down. Make sure you see tomorrow, and never, ever frown.  Don't let them steal your joy, and you will shine again. Life maybe hard and dirty, but i promise you will rise again.  Little women you are a soft flower, waiting eagerly to bloom. Let the world be your love and take you over  and you will be ready soon.
