It's shounen-ai, and though the art style is somewhat strange (the characters are really thin and tall), I love it. The artist is also rather strange (and yay gay), and I like him too. I drew Malache, a villain (I love villains!), as soon as I was done reading the pages up to date. >.> When I like something, I usually 'squee!' and draw. I want to wait before joining the forum, though. I'll try to get my piece of art done before, as a 'gift'. Anyway, I still haven't figured out how to make my scanner work. Bad for fanart...like Subby, I can't submit my entry for the contest.  ;-;  So I do other stuff - I did some oekaki, and now I have to work on dolls ('quest' of sorts). I don't feel like it much though, Oliver's form kinda looks like a girl... and Ryo is better...  Anyway, I got 100% on driving test. Hm, that reminds me, I have to work on boating exam. Oh, I always wonder if my G1 card has arrived. Though, I noticed the area code is mispelled on my temporary permit, so I might not receive it. Guess it's have to make a call anyway and change it... Today, neighbour girl talked to me (and my friend), so that's nice. :) Our instructor is also very funny, even if in his examples he often makes little Johnny die. ^^;;  Hm, did I mention McCain chocolate cake is a vice? :P  I ate almost half a cake yesterday, almost half today. >.> (I don't feel like eating other stuff. We have, like, ham and conserves). My little sister's obssession is currently watching HP puppets... potterpuppetpals.com.  It reminds me of when she was like 8 and watched 'Beauty and The Beast' over and over and over again...  Well, I have to go over to my neighbour's. The mom of the kids I babysit during school is going to give me money for my horseback riding lesson, as a bonus, because she likes me! I'll give her that neat horse drawing I did... She wants to discuss if I can water her plants while she's away too.
