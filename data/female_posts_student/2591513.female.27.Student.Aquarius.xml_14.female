I am however planning on going to Universal for my birthday...I know it is a few weeks away, but it should be fun.  I need to get away.  I need the time to just go away.  I look around the house and am sometimes saddened.  We kept the crib up in preparation for the new baby, but since there will be no baby, we have to take it down...but I know one day that crib will be up again and we will be overjoyed...not worried the next time aorund.  So while I am having a cramp free moment, I thought I would go online and just type in my random thoughts...Leila is going to Disneyland...we won't be going anytime soon...maybe sometime around taxes when we get some money...hmmm....that would be nice.  Well I think that is it...on to more birthday planning.
