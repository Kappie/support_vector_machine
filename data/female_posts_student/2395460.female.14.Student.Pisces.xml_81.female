Hard to think of too much innovation being possible in the world of dishwashers, but leave it to  urlLink Kitchen Aid  to prove us wrong. Introducing  urlLink briva , the in-sink dishwasher. This pint-sized powerhouse is not only a full-service dishwasher, but easily lifts out to give youaccess to an extra-deep second sink. It also features an integrated cutting board to make it even more useful. The unit fits into a standard 42" or 48" cabinet - seems like a reasonable project for an experienced do-it-yourselfer. (Have I been watching too much HGTV?)
