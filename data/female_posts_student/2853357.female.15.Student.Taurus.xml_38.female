EVERYTHING! also vacuumed the entrance hall... and was thinking about vacuuming the living room but john and ryan were sprawled on it and all their games everywhere... so i vacuumed the downstairs bathroom, and then went upstairs and vacuumed my room, the kids bathroom, AND RYANS ROOM! (that boy TOTALLY owes me... while i've been working my butt off around the house he's been glued to the gc... which only reminds me that i used to be like that =/) jackie was so bored i gave her some windex and she cleaned ryans mirror AND my window... FROM THE OUTSIDE. you should'a seen her face XD! um... ya.   babysitting sucks. especially kids who are pampered. they leave everything out (like my brother) and spill and i end up cleaning up after them... hell, i even ended cleaning up after my parents who were so lazy they just pots and pans everywhere...   its been insane. i've been cleaning like CRAZY...   no, i'm not a clean freak half the time... i just have occasional sprees where if i don't i go crazy...   yep.   they got picked up at 3 (brought some YUMMY CHAMPAGNE MANGOES, MMM, MMM, MMM) and left. THANK GOD! my room is actually clean again... well, sorta. cleaner than it was when jackie was hanging around. =/  oh, and i can't forget it's adam's b-day on the 21st... he stole my planner and wrote that in *rolls her eyes*    and thats about it.  have a nice life! •patty•
