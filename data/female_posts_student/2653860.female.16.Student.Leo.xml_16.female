If it makes no sense to you . . . well, it's a Hal McCuen thing; you wouldn't understand. Enjoy the insanity!  TOP TEN HMC PLAYS:  HONORABLE MENTION-"Three Charms a Time, Distime for Sure"-I didn't see it, nor was I in it, obviously. But I have heard about it, and have no doubt that it would be on the list, had I known it better. For one thing, it's got a cool title. For another it involves time travel. A professional time traveler from the future accidentally brings a man from the past to the present, and must find objects from his descendents to send him back. Just one problem: his descendents think he's crazy.  10-"What in the Sam Hill?"-My first HMC production. Samantha Hill, an orphan girl, must escape slavery from the evil sorceress Omnimax, with the help of her friends: Tom Smith, a horribly shy musician who is always humming, Carolina Washington, a somewhat eccentric writer who is always watching, Victor Wilmingberger, a terribly clumsy kid who is always messing up, and . . . a talking dog? What in the Sam Hill . . ?  9-"The Glimmering Moment of Ping"-Tricia McCarry is deeply distressed when her adopted daughter, Portia, returns home to Forrest Falls to stay. She’s trying to run a store here, and it doesn't help that she already has to deal with a pickpocket, an inept bodyguard for the jeweler upstairs, and some strange kid who says he's an 85 year old magician . . . and doesn't look a day over sixteen. And as if that isn't bad enough, we may not necessarily be on earth! It's just a typical day for Tricia McCarry . . . that is, until the glimmering moment of Ping . . .  8-"Melissa K. Murdock, Will you Please Go Home Now?" (apologies to Dr. Suess)-Melissa K. Murdock doesn't want to go home. She wants to learn about people . . . something she can't do when she's cooped up in her rich parents' home. So when she meets four-year-old Cheyenne Wyoming, a typical child with a thing for lollipops, she thinks she's got it made. But that's before she finds out that Cheyenne’s imaginary friend is a real ghost named Jerome . . . or before she meets Rashel, an evil lady . . . with a cape . . . and somehow gets in the middle of an ancient fight between Good and Evil.  7-"Backstreet mystery in Front Street Hotel"-It's amazing where a writer can get his inspiration. Gene Alder, a struggling writer trying to get an idea for a story, decides to stay at the Front Street Hotel for a while, to see if some relaxation will help him think. What he doesn't realize is that he is in the same hotel as well-known detective, Julie Sanders, and she is on the case to find a missing Backstreet Boys shirt. Could it have been stolen, and if so, who could have done it? That little girl Molly has a knack for stealing things she likes . . . but that strange boy Topher is acting very suspicious. Or is the hotel manager having fun with him? But getting clues might be tough. That gossipy receptionist is still on the phone and the claustrophobic clerk is stuck in the elevator . . . sounds like it'd make a good story.  6-"Nothing Doesn't Happen in McCuen " or “Summer’s Winter Fall” or “Josiah’s Thirteenth Adventure” or “Death Gets a Life” or “Kerri’s Delusions of Fiction” or “Secret Service Slippery Slope” or "Do you get the feeling we have way to many titles for this play?" or . . .-It's just another typical winter night in the little town of McCuen. Attorney Josiah Foreman is up late working again, forcing his secretary Amelia to stay with him but he keeps being interrupted by trifling matters. Some girl is stuck on the road and can’t find her twin sister, a very familiar man keeps walking about talking into his watch, Amelia is muttering about seeing Death in the form of their local undertaker, the President of the United States has fallen into a ditch . . . and of course there's Kerri and her delusions of fiction. If she calls him Mr. Butterbur one more time . . . but no time for that. Summer's got her tongue stuck to the flagpole again. Who says nothing happens in a little town?  5-"Triple Crown"-Those jewels on that crown look very authentic for just plastic props . . . but Sebastion Devolski Smythe (called Sir by those who know him, for obvious reasons) soon finds out that they are, in fact, very real jewels, stolen from jeweler Latasha. Now they need to determine who stole them. Could it have been Sir, the grouchy director, to get revenge on Latasha? Could it be actress Hildy, who handles the crown in the play, and could have easily hidden them there? Could it have been Latasha herself, for the compensation she'd get? Or could it have been Juniper, who just likes shiny things? She is, after all, a wood sprite. It's a strange sort of mystery, and Horace Ludwig is on the case. There's just one problem . . . he's a complete moron.   4-"Where Wolf?"-Joanna Kingston and her friends seem normal enough, just sitting in her coffee shop, listening to Louis's tall theatre tales. But reporter Kelly Brown suspects something is up, especially after hearing of some of the strange activities this group engages in . . . whenever the moon is full. There can be no doubt . . . one of them is a werewolf. But which one? Joanna the friendly coffee shop owner, who seems to have many secrets; Dr. Louis Pine--or could that be Lou Pine, Lupine, as in wolf?; Nigel Houston visitor in town, who for some reason shows up once a month; Tamika, who gets upset for no good reason; or Hannah Wallace the owner of the art museum, who seems to be hiding something. Everyone seems to have a secret, leaving us to ask one thing: Where wolf?  3-"Questionability of Doubt"-There's been a lot of computer hackings around recently. But she covers her tracks so well, it’s been difficult to find proof . . . or even who she really is. But it's nothing computer expert and salesman Roger Thompson can't take care of . . . that is until his mother gets involved. But she suspects someone completely different: ex-con Sam White, who she arrested years ago for hacking. He has been acting a tad suspiciously lately . . . could he be up to no good again? And what's with that monkey in that loud shirt? No matter; there's work to be done, and Gertrude will unwittingly enlist the help of Tiana Martensen—who happens to be the same suspect Roger is following--to help her catch Sam and protect her son . . . that is, if she isn't distracted by what people are wearing . . .  2-"Quarantine"-My last play, with arguably the best title. It's another typical day for Dr. Gregg. Gypsy girl needs an allergy prescription, orphan wants to know about her parents, and as usual, there's Lyn, the odd woman who seems to always be watching. But when a runaway girl brings her sick brother to see him, the building must be quarantined. As patient after patient goes to see the doctor, they learn about each other, and about themselves.  And the number 1 HMC play: "The Fourth Wall"-Four women disappear mysteriously from their own times, to find themselves together in a future not to their liking: their beloved town abandoned, except for Daniel, the mysterious caretaker, who must convince them to back and change the paths they are on, or a disastrous future will result. Through the mysterious technology that causes lives to become scripted, and with the help of a mysterious theatre patron from another realm, Daniel must convince a lady to marry, a musician to play, an evangelist to council, and a girl to stay . . . all the while teaching the women about the people they live with and the choices they make . . .  "So, we're not necessarily on earth . . ."
