Although, I suppose anybody who works in a corporate office, will be able to find many scenes that are mimicked in their own offices. However, that doesn't in any way, lessen the significance that the movie has on me.  But I digress. I did not start this blog with the intention of talking about this movie. What I wanted to say was, how today, is such a typical shitty Monday. Indeed. In every way possible.   I'm behind on my reading. I only read one of three homework assignments. I read, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," which by the way, I LOVE! It is a very disturbing story that follows a woman's fall into insanity. Now, I still have to read, Edith Wharton's "Souls Belated" and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's, "The Revolt of Mother." I only hope they are not long stories, for I have a disgusting amount of work piling up on my desk.   Ugh. What a  disgusting  monday.
