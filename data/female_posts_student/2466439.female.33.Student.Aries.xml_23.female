He wants to do some truly horrid things to our country, to MY country.  He is doing awful things to this country.  Actively working to deprive people of their rights is undemocratic and unpatriotic.  My marriage does not hurt anyone.  It certainly doesn't hurt society as a whole.  (That would be a trick, wouldn't it?)  Some days, I get a little tired of being queer in a homophobic society.  I'm in the midst of trying to get health insurance for Becky, and the affadavit I'm supposed to sign to access domestic partnership benefits requires that I state that I'm not married.    Well, I am.  I'm just married to another woman.  I feel like this is going to suck.  Becky HAS to have insurance.  It's not optional.  The whole thing is just so frustrating.
