I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...
