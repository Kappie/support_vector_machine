It hurt my throught SO bad, I almost DIED!!  It was interesting. Then I saw Mr. Interesting himself...this punk dude I used to like. Haha. I am quite ashamed. He is a band geeek turned punk. Enough said.   Then we went home and I finished cleaning and the guest started coming.    It was an interesting party..all these scary little kids over so Austin, Alissa, and I hid in the bathroom and played cool. Interesting timmmeees. I lost. :9 Sad...veeerrryy sad.   then we just ate desert and fatty foods. Yummmmmm!!  Austin is soooo coool!! I never ever get to see him anymore because we both go to different churches now :(  he goes to Marc, Eric, and Aarons church. Hah! The poooor soul. I might go to church w/ him sometime, that would be fun in a scary sorta way.  Then we played sardines with all the kids and everyone. I was the person who was supposed to hide and be found so I hid in my brothers closet and I saw my present by accident! Ooops :) I didn't see what it was though, just the bag, so it might not even be mine.  Anywho...we played in the dark so I was sitting in his closet then Carter (Austins little brother) came and he tried to find me. When he was looking in the closet he bent over and his head hit my nose and my nose started BLEEEDING! Yuckkk! I had blood all over me.  We stoped playing.   Then I drank more soda.   Then Lori Ann, Austin, and I went exploring in our addition to our house. It was a little scary in the dark.  Then Matta nd Freddy came and tried to scare us. It didn't work. :)  Well I guess thats it...I am getting sleeeepppy.   I am gonna sleep in SUPER long tomorrow! YIPEE!
