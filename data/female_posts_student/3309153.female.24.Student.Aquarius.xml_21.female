So I'd look like a professional person instead of what I actually am...a college bum, someone who does well if she brushes her teeth that day and wipes her ass properly. Just kidding about that last bit. I always wipe my ass, but I do admit to sitting there taking a long sigh sometimes while I muster up the energy. Anyway, the hair. Oh my God. It's huge. I used to love this hair style, but that was back when my hair was in a cute little bob, now it's clear down to my shoulders and, therefore, much too long for all these curls. It's huge! There are thousands, I believe, quite literally thousands of curls framing my cherubic little face. I hope this has never happened to any of you. This gorgeous, yet humongous hair is going to ruin my life. Because it will force me to not be hired on for the job, I really will run out of money and become homeless. But luckily, these granite curls will still be in tact and I could probably sell my body on the street to desperate men for a couple bucks. At least I won't starve.  In future, I promise, Lord Krishna, to be more thoughtful about what I tell those infinitely powerful people (hairstylists) to do as they coif me. I swear I will seriously consider the fact that I just may be getting too old for these Shirley Temple locks.   For now, I'm done in. Still...I think I would quite like it if it weren't for the job. After 2:30 pm tomorrow, I'll be a bit happier about it, I think. I'll be sure to report.
