Will this like all the others throw me back onto the floor? But what is selfish about wanting him to be him. Nothing influencing it, wanting my daddy to except him, my daddy the only man in my life who hasn't hurt me yet. Do I really have wounds so deep I will ruin this for myself. But. I do not question that I feel this is right. My heart says it is, I trust it is. When I'm with him it feels right. When I'm not with him it feels right. I miss him a minute after leaving. Am I too attached? I want to have him with me all the time. Am I already obsessed? I just want to be with him. He makes me happy and I hope I make him happy. I'm scared. I don't want to be hurt again, I don't think he'll hurt me but I don't know. I'm not psychic. I don't want to be ashamed of something that makes me feel whole. Why should I? I'm so busy being afraid that others will look down upon me for making a choice to be with someone that is very close to my opposite, that my dad will think me irresponsible for being with someone I've waited long to be with that I force my opinion on him. It's his life I can't control it. I just want him to be him. He's different and he doesn't see it. I see it. It's not the same person I fell for so long ago. It's a cocky, pretentious, rude, pompus, horrid, different person when he does it. Thats what I see. Not the gratuitous, wonderful, warm person he can be. But I can't make him. If I'm going to be with someone I want it to work. Is that so much to ask? Am I being pushy, over-emotional, just plain stupid? What am I doing wrong? I just want this to work so bad, I've waited so long and he is such a good person. For some reason only I see that he is such a wonderful person. My friends think I'm crazy but I'm not. It's my decsion and I think it was a good one. I sound like a tween. It's sad. But I needed to vent. I don't care if you like it, or read it. No one reads this. It's my diary. Just accsessable.
