Yes, no more winning around, chasing after those losers, wondering what the hell I did wrong.... Cause I didn't.  I'm way too good for this, I'm smart, pretty, sexy and successfully women. I have my priorities, and a whole life ahead..So I'm done with these games, it's waste of my time and a waste of energy, it's just not worth it. I'm tired of being such a pain in the ass, always complaining, and felling down and bringing people down with all this crap. I'm moving on!
