Proclaiming a "Happy Easter" he handed us free cupcakes. Well, Twinkie left but 5 minutes later he was back and came up to ask me something. What? I said, as he removed his hood to reveal that Twinkie Boy was actually pretty cute. Asking how old I was and for my number I began to laugh. "Oh come on! How often can you say a Twinkie asked for your number?" I made him wait for my answer but eventually I instead got his number. Twinkie Boy was actually 20 and my mom decided that no way could I ever call him. Nonetheless, in his honor, April 10th is now National Twinkie Day.
