For now I'll just say hello my name is Hannah and this is my blog. I'll probably talk about Chris (my boyfriend), Louise, Lauren, Alison, Rachel, Laura and Stephen (all close friends, all amazing people) in future entries. I would write more but I'm annoyed because I lost my entire entry (it was so long!).  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
