It dont matter how much money you have or what you can do in life, friends are f****** important to everyones happieness and those who dont have them are sad people. Pennie and Helen used to be popular people, but although they spent alot of money tried hard and pulled out all the stops to make today good, they simply dont have enough people who care about them to make it a sucess. If more people were there it would have been fun, they have thought about themselves too much this year and have ended up in an unfortunate situation (mainly pennie). Today has made me realise how important my friends are to me, especially my best friend and other close friends i have around me. I urge you all to think about your friends, and next time your having some 'huge argument' stop and think, why weaken or lose a friendship. No one can have too many friends, Just a thought. Talk to you all soon, hopefuly i will be able to come to the cinema on Wednesday. See you all soon, Dave
