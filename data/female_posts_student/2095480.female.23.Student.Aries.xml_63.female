Oh well. I had a lovely trip to see Scott. The drive down there was frightful due to some extreme weather in North Florida, and the drive back was interesting in that I had to stop on the interstate for a helicopter. Now that said, I know I can't just leave it at that. Simply, I was cruising rather quickly on I75N and I notice a low flying chopper. Well, knowing that FL has a history of issuing tickets from the air, I slowed it down a bit. When its search/landing lights came on, I thought.. uh... what's goin' on? Then, rounding a curve, yeah... it decides to land right in front of me. That was a first.  It was great to see Scott, and we got to hang out the whole weekend. I kicked off my visit w/ a round of some sort of virus/food poisoning.. something. Anyway, the rest of the trip was me trying to find my voice in order to talk to Scott. He was a good sport about it all.   Did I mention that Florida is cool? Well, it is!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I found the following on a website (www.thegoosenest.com). I pulled what I felt was the best.   From the  100 Things You Shouldn't Do in Valdosta    1.Reminisce about the Good Ol' Days when Hugh Bailey was President of Valdosta State University.   2.Circle repeatedly around the VSU campus in your late-model sports car while playing really loud rap music and carrying several ounces of marijuana in your glove compartment.  3.Expect to make a living wage at Valdosta State University  4.Expect anything intelligent in the VD Times Rant and Rave  5.Say that academics is more important than football  6.Call VSU “Valdosta College”  7.Try to get anywhere on time if driving on Bemiss Road.  8.Drive through Remerton too fast, too slow, or too close to the center line.  9.Try to turn left onto Gornto from the Baytree Bank of America parking lot  10.Spit off the Sky Walk at VSU  11.Transport drugs on I-75 and drive real fast  12.Being late and expecting not to catch the damned old train on Baytree   13.Being early and not expecting to catch the damned old train on Baytree   14.Let go of your shopping cart in the Publix parking lot." It will roll 'til it hits 30 mph or a person, whichever comes first!  15.Drive to Lake City for beer on Sunday and speed back to Valdosta with no headlights on.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
