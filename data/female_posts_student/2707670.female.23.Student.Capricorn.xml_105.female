GEEZ-i think it is safe to say i am in desperate need of some days off!   so my big event for today has been beginning the official announcement of my big news...   NO i am not getting married although that has been the first response from a majority of people when i declare i have something important to say... my news is that i am moving to California in June and i am so very excited for all of the possibilities that are going to come along with it... SUNSHINE HERE I COME!!!  everyone should come and visit :)
