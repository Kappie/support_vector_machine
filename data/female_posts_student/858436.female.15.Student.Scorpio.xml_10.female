I'm still worried about Al not being in training, but hopefully things will work out. He was good when I rode him. We were gonna go on a trail ride, and I didn't really want to ride Al considering that his left front ankle was a little swollen from a cut. So I rode one of Mandy's horses. It was really fun. And it's good that I decided not to ride Al on the trail, because we rode maybe five miles! We were in the woods, as well. And through this really deep creek. It was really cool.  Let's see, what else. Saturday I'm going to Memphis with my grandmother. To see a play. And shop. 'Twill be fun, indeed.  Did I mention that Chris is freaking hilarious? He cracks me up, dude.  Tomorrow I have a geometry test. Oh joy. I have a C+ in that class and my dad still seems disappointed. And I'm ranked 17 out of 28! Hmph. I told him how I got a C on my physics test and he seemed disappointed too. Well, sorry that ND is a LITTLE bit harder than SFX! My God! He doesn't even get geometry, and he's all mad at me?! He said he wasn't mad, but he said my grades need to be higher. Yeah whatever. I'm trying, okay? I'm trying.  I need to start planning an outfit for Activity Week dance. I can't decide whether or not I should wear a skirt or pants and a cool shirt. For some reason, I'm envisioning red pants and a sleeveless black top, maybe a sleeveless black turtleneck? Hm... if only I had MONEY! Haha.  P.E. today was okay, since we didn't have to do anything with balls. We jumped over boxes. I did all of them except the last one. I didn't even try that one to spare myself the embarassment. Haha. If only we could ride horses for P.E.... now I'd enjoy that class.   Mkay, this post is long enough.
