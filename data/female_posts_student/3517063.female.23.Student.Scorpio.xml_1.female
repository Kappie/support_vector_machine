Why is there no pig cheese? Pigs are mammals. They produce milk. Why can't that milk be turned into cheese? I'm sure it would become a yuppie delicacy in no time. Or how about horse cheese? I can already see the menu - "Arugula salad with raspberry-caper vinaigrette, olive bread croutons and horse cheese," or "Pig-cheese asparagus ravioli with a champagne cream sauce."  So why not?
