I know what darkness means (and the void you learned from me) The isolation steams (So I think it wants to bleed) The echoes in my brain (All the things you said to me) You took my everything Now I'm coming for you!  [Chorus:] I won't back down I will not bow I've come to bring you hell I can’t forget Things you did I've come to bring you hell  The shadows that you see (In the places that you sleep) Are memories of me (Better pray your soul to keep) The truth behind your eyes (You know the thing you never see) Your darkest little lies I'm coming for you!  [Chorus]  All the scars that never heal All the wounds that will not seal I will not forget the day These memories never fall  [Chorus]  I've come to bring you hell (I've come to bring you hell) [x4]  You know how lately I've been questioning who my real friends are and how I have three different sections that friends are divided into...well I had an experience to prove that you only have a couple close good friends in your life. There are lets say, people who you spend time with because you feel obligated to, but also...because of status.   But last night, I realized what isn't my friend.   I went out after work, to get something to eat...and the people I was with started fighting with each other...so I just asked to have my food packed up so we could leave...then I ended up paying the entire fucking bills. Yah thats what friends are for. Thanks :D Let me cover everything for you... but I wouldn't have minded if they would have said thank you. People buy me stuff but I ALWAYS thank them for it. One of them thanked me, but the other who is supposed to be a good friend ignored me for the rest of the night.   I came home and ate in peace because I couldn't take it. Then I find out that after they dropped me off...they went out. Thanks guys.  My curefew was 1 am...it was 11:38 when I got dropped off. I felt horrible. Like...am I so horrible that people can't spend time with me or what the fuck?  Then...they said that the guy whom I have a bit of a crush on...is "fat and ugly" "holy fuck kate...he's so fucking nasty". Thanks  I'm upset...but I can't make a deal of it right. I can't be pissed off...and want to just throttle them right?   FUCK!  And you know what?? I am a good person. I don't need this shit.
