I have found that when I talk I just weave myself into more and more trouble..  I have decided to never go to school and live in my room. Now I will never have to face people..or anything.  Why have I come to this important decision you ask?  Because people make me mad.  [if you are sick of me complaining just ignore my rambeling]  See, wherever I go it seems as if people don't care about what I have to say. Like if people listened, I would talk. but they don't seem to want to listen so i don't talk...  Well, Mandy listens. But she is a rare exception.  It seems like everyone is caught up with there own lifes and stuff that I seem to just be whisked away with the wind.  Oh well.  It's kinda fun to be my own best friend.  I have common intrests with my best friend.  We go EVERY where together...  humph.
