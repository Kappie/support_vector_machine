This means that, not only is it better for you, but there is a holding property on the wedge found only on burnt chips, which are icky. -The "wedge" shape. Unique amongst potato based foods, the potato wedge's "wedge" shape grants consumers a far more stable structure. This means that not only is chewing more enjoyable as there is more to bite into, but also the surface means that it is better to get sauce onto.
