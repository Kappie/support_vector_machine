Do you think I'm crazy b/c I bring another shirt to change into after PE? My first one gets all stretched out with all the taking on and off. YaH. So.  It was so sad b/c Clinton made it so people that needed welfare could get it regardless of conditions. That law or whatever it is he made, runs out this year two days after xmas. That means that all the people that are on welfare are going to be pennyless. California has it the worst. It is said it is going to be the worst welfare cut in California. Gray Davis is trying to delay the cut just enough so everyone on it can be fine. There's said to be a estimate of 300,000 people on welfare. May god have pity on their souls.   Eat your heart out.
