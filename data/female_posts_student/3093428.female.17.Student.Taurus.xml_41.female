Yes, I am dressed cheerily in a yellow polo shirt, jeans, and flip flops, but my demeanor is no different from a day where I would otherwise be dressed in sweatpants and a grey hoodie.  However, my day is slightly brightened, knowing that tonight, I should be receiving Coalition's 500 EP order back from the duplication house. Which is fabulous, because I hate waiting. My mood is also relieved because I uploaded a new playlist onto my mp3 player last night (which I did get new  batteries for) and now, I can walk with a bounce in my step, while Jimmy Eat World and  The Middle  play in the background.  Dear Fellow Bloggers, I propose we all go swimming on the 24th, after Sam and I complete our final exam: Literature 12. Spread the word. Sincerely, Stephanie Ip
