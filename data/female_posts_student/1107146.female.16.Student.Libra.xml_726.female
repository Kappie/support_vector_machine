Didn't work with Michael or Scott, so what makes me think it would work with Rob?  Anyway, I'm getting him some Steven Hawking books, cause he gets all his from the library.  and no wonder, they're freaking expensive!!!  And cookies, cause every guy I've talked to said I have to give him food.  That must be a guy thing.  And if you know what he's getting me, is this a good idea in that light?  Did that make any sense at all?  At this point, I don't care.  Studying for the English exam has eaten my brain.
