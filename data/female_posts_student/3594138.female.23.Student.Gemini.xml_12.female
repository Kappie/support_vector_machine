Granted, I haven't watched all of the seasons of the show, but I know that Joey ends up with Pacey. I like "The Kiss" because it's when Dawson and Joey seem to be the happiest; their relationship is new, exciting, romantic... none of the other complications have happened yet. That's how I like to remember the show.
