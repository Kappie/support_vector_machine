They huddle in the town square, about to debate what to do about the impending doom that heads their way. SmooBee, the Secretary of War of SmookieLand, makes her way to the podium...   SmooBee:  My fellow Smookians... our land has been a peaceful one for many generations... there have been no wars, poverty, or any hardluck of any kind, but now, I say pick up your weapons of mediocre destruction and FIGHT!! ( The Smookians cheer ) We will find them on the land! ( cheering ) We will fight them in the air! ( cheering ) We will fight them in the- ( giant mutant radioactive flesh-eating butterfly swoops down from the sky and devours SmooBee. It is followed by millions more giant mutant radioactive flesh-eating butterflies who attack and destroy all of SmookieLand... )  After the horrid massacre, only one Smookian remains... he stands and looks around. He picks up a rock and promises to rebuild....... but is then picked up by a butterfly that missed him and eaten...  + Fast Forward: 10 seconds later +  Highly advanced Smookians from across town come into SmookieLand, rebuild, and begin happy, successful lives in a span of  two hours        Oh, yeah...
