Its funny how he tries to look after me even from on the other side of the world. I told him about how my hand was killing me and that I made an appointment with my Doctor for Monday. I told him that I would let him know if the Doctor suggests surgery or not.   I also told Jesse that I have been worrying about him a lot, usually when I have nothing to do, which is real funny because, I always have something to do, yet I always find the time to worry about him. I just miss him so much. Saturday is our nephew Isaacâ€™s 5th Birthday. Jesse wont get to be home for this one but I hope am going to attempt to take the video camera there and see if I can video tape some of it for him. I plan to go get the capture card for the computer soon and have my brother install it for me then I can hook the camera into the computer and record the video on a CD for Jesse to see. It will be cool. Jesse has given me a few ideas of ones to get but told me hands down to buy it from Circuit City, because they have the best prices I guess. It wont be the best quality video but its better than nothing and this way he can see how our niece and nephews look now and see some home video of family events.   I miss him a lot.
