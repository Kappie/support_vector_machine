I don't miss him terribly, but selfishly, I wish he was still here. Bible study won't be as fun without him! But nonetheless, his happiness is more important  it's good he's gone back to Korea to finish his Architecture degree.       A simple, warm gesture that shows ‘I care’ is but a phone call away.
