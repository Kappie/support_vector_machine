You are slushing and moist and cold and much more conducive to spending a day indoors working then some other days I could name this week.   I suppose for that, thank you.   I suppose that you are watering the soil, making up for those long sunny bitter febuary days where the dry cold whips us in a frenzy and leaves nothing to show for it but wind chapped cheeks and sun burned nose.   It all evens out in the end.   My mom used to say that to us all the time, "It all evens out in the end."  When I am among friends that I love, I will buy them food and presents, knowing that I am putting forth something that will come back.  When I am down and have been hurt, I believe that I do not need to "blacken" my karmic record by taking action- as action in a divine way will be taken.   But I also believe that we should take notice of injustice, and stand up for others- who will stand up for us if we don't?  It all evens out in the end.   Quite frankly, we die.  We, all of us, everything, will move into a space of nothing or everything (are they the same?) and once there...?   You see, if I believe that this conception of a soul is made of words and social control, then where do I go?   What happens to me, the me that I feel reverberating within my chest?   What happens to the me that whispers answers to questions I didn't even know I was asking?   There are places that I believe in that are beyond the power of the brain, beyond powers of speech, and beyond knowledge that can be expressed any where but in dreams.   I had them again last night, and I woke up at 730, and thought about them, and then how I would just shut my eyes till 8, and then it was 9 and there were dreams every where and I couldn't reach them.  Having watched the patterns of my dreaming for ten years I have a good sense of how and why they are doing this.  When I get stressed out they retreat-  but rarely are they so vivid and waiting- they are waiting for me to just sleep until I am forced awake by them, not by some sense of obligation to the world.   It is well past time for starting to do in the day.   Way past time for a lot of things really, but that is neither here nor there.   I feel ready to pounce on the world today.   Do you think that she's wise to it?
