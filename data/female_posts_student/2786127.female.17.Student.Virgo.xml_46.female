I hate sitting around...even if it is to watch Sex and the City, which I've been doing all morning.   It's weird that I've gone from wanting to have alone time constantly to not being able to stand it, not even for as little time as an hour. I need to be out with people, keep things entertaining...I really want my friends back.   I finally figured out what a strap on looks like today. eww. thanks sex and the city, somethings are just best kept secret.   Hawaii countdown: 15 days.
