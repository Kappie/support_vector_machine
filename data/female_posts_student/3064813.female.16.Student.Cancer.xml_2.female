I don't know if I can even explain it.  I mean....  Grah.  People sound stupid when they try to say something profound, so I guess I'll just try to hurry it up and spare everyone the agony of reading this. Bravery tastes sweet. It really does.  Being a spineless coward only has it's comfort for so long, until one day a person just goes... "FUCK IT" and goes out and does something incredibly stupid....  But sometimes that incredibly stupid thing is also incredibly brave, and it feels so damn great. Hmm, what else do I have to be happy about?  God....  I'm listening to Atom and his Package, which kicks major ass.  It's a song called "He Kissed Me".  It starts of with the guy going... "Hey guys, this is a song about a guy who kissed me on the face." Heh heh heh.  IT MAKES ME LAUGH.  Oooh who is this?  My playlist surprises me all the time.  It sounds like either Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, or MxPx.  WHO IS IT?? *suspense* *suspense* *suspense* IT'S MxPx!!!!!!!  WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  I am in such a good mood.  This is so sad.  I wish that Liz and Kait were here, though.  That's the ONLY DARK SPOT on my parade.  My life would be PERFECT if they were here.  Grah.  Why couldn't Boise be sucked through a warp hole and fused with League City or something?  How cool would that be?  I'd DIE. Dum dee dum....  In such a good mood....  I need to call Kait, though.  I think she's not doing too well.  It needs to be summer NOW.  I need a job, concerts, and a cell phone so that I can talk to people ALL THE TIME.  *dances around in circles* I'm gonna go now, so BYE!!!!!  Much love, Lily
