(my dad works with the husband sort of) they are nice oldish ppl. ok, fine..they aren't old but they are at least 10 years older than my parents.   their family has this whole brady bunch deal going on..but i won't get into it.   and it's hard to explain...kind of....*sigh* i won't get into that either.   they stayed a few hours, and yeah...we didn't need all the food we bought. *sigh*   gosh this was a boring post.   i'd get into curiosa but i still don't feel like it.   sorry ashpash.
