So I finished the tests, and I took a nap and when I woke up, I talked to people. And the first thing I was reminded about was the loss of an amazing person whose student I was privileged to be. Mr. Schiavone had a lot to give us and he shared so much with us, but now he is sadly no longer with us. All I am left with to say is I hope he rests in peace.   That's why this blog is entitled what it is. I'm happy I'm done with the tests and I feel relieved, but on the other hand, I feel a great sadness and loss. I'm sure that's how a lot of seniors felt yesterday. Their prom was the same night as hearing such devastating news. They were supposed to have one of the best nights of their lives thus far, but I'm sure, for many of them, this loss hung over them. I try to take comfort in the belief that he is in a better place now, but somehow, it doesn't help much.  Mr. Egan quoted someone very wise and said, "Grief is the price you pay for loving someone." It's sad, but I guess the only thing left to do is to remember the good times and memories.   So I guess these mixed feelings won't last forever. They can't possibly last forever. On the one hand, I'm happy. On the other, at least for now, I'm also sad.
