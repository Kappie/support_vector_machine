Jackson was a passenger in a Chrysler convertible driven by Aaron L. James, 16, of Huntertown. James collided with a vehicle driven by Scott T. Burns, 18, of Auburn, near the intersection of Garman and Hull roads shortly before 8 p.m., state police said. Jackson died at the scene. The Allen County Coroner’s Office determined she died of blunt force trauma to her head and neck, Coroner Dr. E. Jon Brandenberger said. She was wearing a seat belt, but it couldn’t save her life because of the severity of the impact, police said. Burns and James were both hospitalized in fair condition Sunday. James was airlifted to Parkview Hospital with injuries to his face and head. Burns injured his lower leg, police said. Troopers continued to investigate the accident cause Sunday. The vehicles collided head-on as the James car was eastbound and the Burns car was westbound. The collision occurrednear the center of the road, police said."           yeah so what were the assholes doing? thats right-playing chicken. scott and aaron should have been the ones to die, not lindsay. it makes you think about how fragile life really is, and how so many things, even life in general, are taken for granted. lindsay, the only innocent one in the incident, was the one to die. at least scott is 18 and can be tried as an adult. i hope they're brought up on manslughter-and convicted. i hate them both. i did before this, but this has just deepened that so much more. fucking bastards.        its so sad.
