Now I know ther are gonna be people out there who are like "You just don't like it, 'cause you don't  get it " to you I say: "FUCK YOU!".  I got it, I got the Plato, I got the biblical references, I get it. I understand and have the ability to follow a plot, I can read into things and analyze them not on the "obvious" level.  That being said: aren't I allowed to feel disappointed that the movie didn't work out the way I wanted it?    I will say this: too preachy, too allegorical, too over the top with effects that could have been money spent elsewhere to make a better plotline.  Either its a KungFu, Shoot 'em up movie or its a preach fest: make up my mind.  I would like to go on record as saying if Sunday morning services were as action packed as Revoltions that would probably get attendance WAY up.    Its not just Revolutions that was so disappointing, it was also reloaded.  I think that the Wachowski's tried to hard to mass market and make a blockbuster that they lost sight of where they were going with the movie when it first came out.  They spoonfed you the obvious underlying ideas of Neo being "the one" etc.  how stupid do they think we are.  I dunno,  after rushing to see it last nite I feel I honestly could have waited.  Plus the theatre full of perps who were talking the whole time during an exchange between Neo and Trinity really kind of ruined the experience.  I KNOW that ROTK will not dissappoint, so I'll go out like a super fan girl to check that out and the bang for my holiday blockbuster buck will have been met.    One last thought:  dunno if we all got the same previews but I really want to see a)  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  and b)  urlLink Troy.   Troy looks fuckin' awesome.  As for the preview for  urlLink Torque : I liked it better when it was called "Fast and the Furious".
