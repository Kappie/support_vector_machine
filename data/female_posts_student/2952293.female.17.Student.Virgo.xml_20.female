Everybody else got lemon bars, but they were really good. History was good. We were talking about Malcolm X, and Mr. O'Grady asked who Malcolm would report to after he became a minister, so I said, "Allah??" No it was that Elijah guy, but it was great. CP made brownies for our chem class and Doc asked if there was alcohol in them. I had to take a practice AP Spanish Language test and it was really hard. Ann and Margaret were running around and distracting me. It is so fun to just watch them interact with each other, you could do it for hours. After school I went to Walgreens to develop some digital pictures and drop off my Washington film. Now I'm at home with smelly feet. I'm talking to Ann and making her feel bad cause her brother's hot. I thought I saw Margaret's brother driving today and that was exciting as well. My parents are discussing sending me to visit California with my aunt this summer, because I'm apparently depressed and very suicidal right now. It's nice, but I really don't see me fitting in in California. Oh well, it would be a nice trip, and I've never been there. My nose still hurts from Friday. I wish it would stop being in pain. I love concerts. I have so much work to do, but I'm going to go to Bob Evans tonight with my mom- YES!
