Last night we went to have a dinner at Cindy's (Rico's sister and her boyfriend). Present were: Ilona, Rico, Cindy, Gilbert, Jacqueline (Rico's mom), Gilbert (Gilbert's grandpa), Gilbert's granny and Gilbert's brother Ives.  (It smells like shit, I think I have to go and clean up the cat toilet. Stay tuned, folks.)  So, back. How can one cat produce that much shit? It's amazing.  Yeah, we went to have a dinner at Cindy's (Rico's sister and her boyfriend). ... Yeah. The evening was hilarious! Gilbert is half Swiss, half Spanish. He is lively and sometimes loud. Well, his grandparents are completely Spanish and they are really laidback and nice people :) We others are also not exactly silent or calm... There were really no silent moments. I just loved it :) The feeling there was so warm and comfortable and the food (pasta with various sauces) was Delicious! I really, really felt like a part of the family. Even the grandparents, who met me yesterday for the first time (I think Rico either hasn't met them before...), talked about one family. Like "it's so wonderful to have the family around the same table" etc. During the evening I realised, I'd missed that kinda thing so bad. In Finland we have never had that kind of evening for years now. And when we still did get together for Xmas or so, it wasn't as warmhearted as last evening... A lot because of my mom. Well, I'm not gonna get into this more. I just never had something like last evening and that's why I'm so very happy about it. Can't wait till Thu. Then the whole family is gonna get together again, this time at Rico's mom's.  Otherwise the weekend has been really lazy. We've mostly been sleeping ;) Yesterday, after we'd come home from shopping, I fell asleep with Minka on our most wonderful couch (La Ola by Bretz Brothers) designed for cuddling, naps and generic laziness (http://irc-galleria.net/view.php?nick=sassy_). It was just wonderful! It did so good for me since the day began a bit cranky for me.  Well, being lazy was splendid indeed, but I can't help the bad conscience of not studying at least a bit every day... Well, in about 5 years it's gonna be over and after that I can have bad conscience about other things, haha.   I can't believe I'm tipsy after 3 beers (Ã  0.33 l).  Me and Rico, we're just fine. We talked yesterday about rings and stuff and last week I think it was Thu he said that he has it all in one woman (meaning me, I HOPE!!!!:D): a friend, a lover and a wife. No dates, no specific plans but now I dare to talk about it in public... We've talked about these things before but I'm careful with these things. I don't want to get hurt again... Now I know, that I won't get hurt with Rico. He's the man for me, he's the love of my life. Well, I think I'm gonna get hurt, since no normal relationship is without problems, but I believe my heart won't be slaughtered again. It took so long to heal the wounds after the last relationship and it still hurts sometimes and it has also made me uncertain and careful. If this thing with Rico goes wrong, I think I'll then rather stay on my own. But, I don't want to think about that option. In fact, it's not even an option for me. Not now. He's my friend, my lover and my husband-to-be. Husband... It's a big word, a good word. It's almost overwhelming.  Ok, I'm gonna go to bed. My SO is already there. It's a warm feeling, to think about pressing my head against his warm chest, feeling his caring arms around me...to fall asleep in his arms. I'll leave it to this image...
