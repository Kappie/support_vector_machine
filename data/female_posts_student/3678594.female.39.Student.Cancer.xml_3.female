They look so nice that I feel compelled to do something special with them other than the usual shortcake.  This is where I hit a culinary roadblock. I'm not a huge fan of strawberries [gasp!] and my preparation of them is limited to shortcake and fruit salad. I have a peculiar aversion to baking strawberries into things and shudder at the very thought of strawberry muffins or strawberry pie. I don't mind them cooked into a topping for cheezecake or non-dairy ice cream, though. Call me weird.  While I was mulling over ideas for something that was different, yet easy, I happened to catch The Barefoot Contessa on Food Network Canada. She made a gorgeous summer pudding with strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I found the recipe online and it got very good reviews. This looks like something I would like to make [and my kids would like to eat!]. Ina's recipe is on the rich side with brioche and framboise. My version will be simpler, but I hope, just as tasty!
