There was no Leslie,  no Michelle,  no Emilie, no zacher, stez, jessie....and a few more.  I missed those guys- it just wasnt complete without them!  Maybe next time though.  Nathan came!  I was excited.  and a lot of people came too.  well not a lot but over 10 id say. lol.  Ashley josiah and travis made a trip out so that was cool, but then josiah and i got in a fight over politics (pff i was messed up and i still kicked his ass in a debate, well i thought i did) and so he got angry and left lol.   Aww well.... now i have to start my 45 days over.  damnit i was doing so well too!  i bet i was at 30-sum.  oh well i can do it.  It was just that he offered so i had to oblige the offer man... that stuff is too expensive for me  to but by myself, and id probably get ripped off i did buy it myself.  I ended up sleeping on the floor cuz there was 7 people and 6 sleeping spots but i didnt mind.  Nathan and i stayed up and talked a little bit from across the room while everyone was sleeping, so that was pretty cool.  He said we have to go sleep out under the stars some night- that would be sweet- so yeah i dont really know what else to say so im going to head out.  I'll catch you later internet gods.   G-night and all that silly such Until Time Next
