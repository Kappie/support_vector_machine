Some schools are not even accredited as a college.  For one to spend so much time to learn a profession in such a long period of time is ludicrus these days.  But if you will not pursue nursing, LV is a great place for a construction worker.  One can work from 1am to 8am and sleep the hot day off.  Maybe you can be a 'JOE'y Millionaire' earning $19,000.00 a year.  =)  But seriously, there are lots of opportunity in Vegas.  My cousin moved there, he is a civil engineer for one of the building companies and owns a home about 5 miles from the "Strip".  more to come... NET
