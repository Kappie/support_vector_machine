"did you call about that job?  did you call the guy at the bookstore?  NO."  she said i "can't spend every day this summer with taylor" and that i have spent almost every day with her.  oh my fucking god.  how long was daniel out of school and unemployed??  four, five months???  jesus!  and finally, she got mad cuz i forgot to bring my wallet with my driver's license in it.  she started yelling about how i "can't get into that habit" and how i'll get a ticket and it'll be a pain to deal with.  she was just mad at me the whole fucking time!!  i try to appease her, but it never works.  i invited her to go to the movies tonight with taylor and me, and now she still wants to go.  GOD that's annoying.  you'd think she wouldn't want to be around someone who obviously aggravates her this much.  and when i asked for money, she was so damn stingy and once again, lectured me about how the spending is getting to be too much and it needs to slow down and i can't keep doing these movies and stuff.  and she wouldn't give me money for taylor.    i know i sound so childish by writing all this, but my mom used to be so cool!  she was my best friend a couple of years ago, and we would talk all the time.  i don't know what happened, or what i did to make her this irritated with me.  it makes me almost miss all my dad's shit.  yeah he's an asshole, but i know how to deal with him!  i can't yell at my mother or even get angry with her without severely regretting it, so i don't know what to do.  sigh
