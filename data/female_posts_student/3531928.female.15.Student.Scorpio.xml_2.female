The lunch at the restaurant was 'qutie ok'.. But for the dinner.. DIgusting .. Damm digusting.. As we sat near the toliet which is damm smelly tat was still ok coz the smell only comes out when you open the door .. But when they served the main dish you can see abt 20 flies flying around yur food.. Spoil yur appettie immediately .. Haiz.. Somemore no shopping centre .. When we went to watch the fire-flies in the nitez, the tour guide kept on rushin us.. So fan..She would defend herself by sayin tat"Coz I dunwan you all to wait so long..." Haiz.. A damm lousy tour guide...  Yesterday went to IMM wif my mom.. HmMm... Bought alot thingz as if it was my bdae sia... HahA.. As I was pondering what shoes i wanted for my sch shoes..
