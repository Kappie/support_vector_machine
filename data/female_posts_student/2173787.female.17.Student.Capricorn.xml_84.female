Don't get me wrong I love my family, but can I not have one fucking break to do my own thing.  Last break was thanksgiving and we all know what a blast that was.  So if anyone wants to rescue me to say, oh i don't know, go on a cross country road trip or something of the sort let me know.  My bags are already packed and by the door.  Sorry for swearing...
