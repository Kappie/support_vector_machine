A part of me is weaker A part of me is dead A part of me wants to hide And remove the thoughts in my head  But most of me is stronger I know that in my soul But that part of me that is eating me Is taking full control  A part of me will heal soon And someone will take that place Where you used to be, deep inside me Your laugh and your beautiful face  So part of me is growing And soon will be a scar For I know that you'll be, watching just me And it helps that I know where you are
