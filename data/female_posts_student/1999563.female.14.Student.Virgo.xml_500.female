Then I packed my pur-tay 70s earings! :) [I doubt I will wear them...but they look cool!]    After that I packed a pair of light wash jeans and two tank tops [purple and pink!]   then I packed my MONKEY!! And a pair of dark wash jeans and 3 shirts [target shirt, someone in california loves me, and I think my I Love Pad Thai shirt] Ooh! And my studed belt! Haha.    yay!! I finished packing with way to much stuff for only 4 days! :)    Yay!  I love posting photos of myself!
