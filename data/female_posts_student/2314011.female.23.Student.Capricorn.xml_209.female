The Property exam was pretty good; think I wrote too much, but I'd rather err on that side than being too skimpy.    Contracts for the rest of the night and the whole day today.  After tomorrow, we'll be on the downhill slope.  Feels like we're in the thick of the whole process.  The build-up is finally over and we're rolling, but at the same time, there's still 4 exams left, the mother of all exams coming up tomorrow.  And then there's only 3 left.  Fuck.  Feels like it will never be over.  And yet, there's not enough time to get fully prepared.    I realize this is very fragmented and boring.  My peeps are discussing the demise of vowels and commas in their attempts at getting their outlines down to 10 pages.    How did it come to this?
