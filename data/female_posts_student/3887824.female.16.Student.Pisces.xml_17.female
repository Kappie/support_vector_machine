       
      Vickie is here and we are having a great time.  We've been having long walks and hikes, then going around to a few places.  Plus movie viewing (older Batman movie, episodes of Tenchi in Tokyo, some Fellowship of the Ring, The Village) and playing games (Trivial Pursuit Junior, Bible Trivia, etc.)  Also throughout the day we'll do some yoga.  I named a position, "Head clamp," for obvious reasons if you'd see it.  Fun stuff.  Anyway, it's so cool to just spend time with her like this.  It's wonderful that she's even here.  Tomorrow afternoon we're going to the beach, I think, then on Monday to an art museum, and to Leif's on Tuesday.  Ideas for activities are still floating around.  Every morning (well, except for this morning) we have and will be walking to Dunkin Donuts.  Yay for half a bagel / donut / muffin.  Mocha swirl latte... yummy... yes, so we will miss things like that at Camp Heritage.  But yeah.  Anyway, just thought I'd update and give a short summary of Vickie's time here and stuff we're up to.   Happy Sabbath!
