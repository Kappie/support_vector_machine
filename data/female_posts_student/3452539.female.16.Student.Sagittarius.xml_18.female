As I said to him, I do not believe that I have ever hurt so bad in my entire life. I got home around 1...got told a few minutes later...it is now 1:32 and I have been crying since. Why does it have to happen this way. I do not want to loose him...ever.  I wish I could just run there, not caring what anyone thought or said. There is only one person who matters.  Here Without You - 3 Doors Down   A hundred days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies have made me colder and I don't think I can look at this the same But all the miles that separate They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face  I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby, and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, there's only you and me  The miles just keep rolling, as the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated, but I hope that it gets better as we go  I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me    Everything I know and anywhere I go It gets hard but it won't take away my love And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done It gets hard but it won't take away my love    I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I'm here without you baby, but you're still with me in my dreams And tonight (boy), there's only you and me
