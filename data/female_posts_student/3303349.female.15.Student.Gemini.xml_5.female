Anyway...today was good. French class was even good. My stalker was hitting on me mercifuly durring gym class (I need to reveal his name sometime...) But one of my friends was acting depresssed today because Sarah Degoyer wasn't there today and obviously yesterday she said that she didn't like him. I fell bad for him because I had to do the same thing a few weeks ago. Anyway I took it upon myself to make him not depressed and I have to admit that I did a really crappy job of it. What else...Lunch was very good and fun. Ashley kept throwing licorish down my shirt but it was good because I got a lot of licorish out of the deal. Nick wass amusing as always and Paul was being a fungus...(Ha ha Paul)...The stupid people in my band STILL don't know their parts but I was happy because I didn't mess up on my solo. We have a concert coming up on tuesday so that means I get out of class to rehearse which is ALWAYS fun. Uhhh...science didn't suck and I read durring the movie in history because we had a sub. I enjoyed it emensely. Then I got to see all of my odd friends after school...in the rain... and (It is time to reveal my stalker's name...) Tony kept hugging me. Then he was said "Hey you should call me some time" and I had to go into my fear of the phone. Yes so today was good. I have to go to Billings tonight. Stay the weekend but I have all of my major projects out of the way and all I have to look forward to is finals...wo ho. You gotta love um. Well I shall be back soon enough. Au Revoir mes amies!
