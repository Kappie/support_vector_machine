I get the impression that the pro-Bush folks are feeling a little bitter about not having anything to compete with F-9/11. Michael Moore is a liberal activist. He has strongly stated his position and quite frankly he made this movie to persuade people not to vote for Bush.   It's propaganda. And unfortunately, if this movie is anything like his last one, there will be many inaccuracies. THAT is what gets me mad. The fact that it's bullshit propaganda. If it is full of lies, like I suspect it will be, then in my eyes, Moore is just as bad as Bush.   Why is being truthful so damn difficult?
