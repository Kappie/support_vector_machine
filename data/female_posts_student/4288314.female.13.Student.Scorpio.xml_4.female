(also cos i was afraid my parents found my diary) sigh. today was my chinese common test. luckily i studied hard. i think i'll get at most five wrong for my "han zhi" section.. the rest is up to God. i'm really poor at the other sections. so i did my part and studdied the parts i could studied. i gave it my best shot.   happening #1   today will be a day so significant in my life.. well at least for the next fem months or so. i went to collect my new spectacles. the optician said that my cornea and conjunctiva was inflammed last week. however.. after i shortened my contacts wearing time, my cornea healed. so it's left wit the conjunctiva to heal. it'll take months. sigh.guess i'll wear specs for the next 8 months? oh well. darn.   happening #2  today i was on 157 bus going home from school. in front of me were two 'bengs' i saw at the corner of my eyes them pointing and looking at me. i was freakd out. i was like.. did i do anything wrong? they were with two othe girls. suddenly, one girl stuck out her mobile phone and told me that one of the guys wanted me number. i was even freaked out. i merely rejected her offer. she demanded why.. i blurted out that i had already had a boyfriend.. they were like.. 'are your sure? or you just trying to gek.. is he studying? wat level.. wat is his name?' i answered all their questions obediently.. sigh. i felt like a complete wimp. har. but its over. at that time.. i could feel my heart beating so fast.. i was really scared.. heh. but i've forgotten about it le.. heh.. ookies time to go. will blog when my parents or out the next time! wee! oh ya! lub ya derek!
