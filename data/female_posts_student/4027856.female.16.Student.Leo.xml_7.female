You can be in any mood and music can either takeyou out of it, or just heighten it. For ex. The Killers - "  Andy YouraStar  ". Such an awesome song...you have to hear it. So as of now everyone reading this is required to eitherillegally download it (which I don't suggest) *wink wink* mister officer......OR just go buy it. Plainand simple. Get it? S off to work tonight...and depressed I will be without my music...but instead I will take   Dirty Dancing 2   and watch it like I do every night I work. That is the joy of working in the video store....you can watch videos! Wow...yea its fun. So I willl be at work, shakin my god given bon bons to "  Represent Cuba  "....and it will be bloody fantastic...that's all I have to say about that
