Maybe seeing it will help me? Maybe i truly do need to see someone, talk to someone. She doesn't know, and i can't tell her, she thinks its genuine, she thinks he does, just like i did, she needs to be told. I can't let her get hurt, not like i got hurt, not like i got made to feel loved and special, whats going to stop him getting engaged to her? Oh fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk This doesn't do any good, why do i ask questions i don't want the answers to? And she still knows how i feel, basically because i can't just listen to how they both feel about each other.  ~Lisa~
