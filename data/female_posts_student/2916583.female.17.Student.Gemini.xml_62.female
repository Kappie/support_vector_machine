I made the mistake of asking Shawn G. and Alex a sex question (does that V thing u do with ur fingers that looks like the symbol for peace rele mean u want to get sum), and they made sure to keep my face crimson the entire class. Both of them kept flashing it the ENTIRE class, and Alex drew it on the white board to me! I don't take it seriously for a sec, but it was still a bit embarrassing. Thank God that was the last math analysis class I'll ever have with them. Hopefully they didn't sign up to take AP Stat, cuz I'll never live that one down.  In case you can't tell, I'm practicing for when I'm a senior...having senioritis.  This is straight from my buddy profile, except I'm adding a few things on this.  I'm not sure why, because no one reads this anymore.  Good for me cause I can say what I want again...it will be like a neo-classical age in the blog.  To celebrate a neo-classical revival, I'm putting in some lines soon to be classics.  The first two come from a worksheet we did in Boswell's class on parallelism.    Marcus: "To be popular, she thought, she only had to earn straight A's, drive a sweet car and date a guy like Mike M."   Matt F.: "She was afraid of everything, of little blonde haired children, of fields of tall cornstalks, and of bloody sickles (yea the last one's weird).  Boswell (to Frederick): "Don't mess with the Bos."  Deanna: "Julie Ann, stop touching my boobs."  Shaheen: "Of course the V exists.  That's what happens when you open your legs."  Alex: the V...I tried making a hand, but it just looks like a series of backslashes and underscores when I publish it.  \/ - how about that.  No,I don't want any u sickos.  It's the classic line.   Today was my last day of school (real school, not meddlesome exams). Oddly, I felt the greatest sadness walking out of Mrs. Boswell's class. If I wasn't as respectful as I am (laugh Yasmin), I would have done cartwheels in the doorway goin out of Math Analysis. I'm really gonna miss English, somewhat miss History (mostly because I'll miss having it w/ my best friend, and I'll miss Knight's interesting spin on stuff, even if he can be a bit annoying at times...ok Joe sorry for saying that about ur IDOL), I'll miss the PEOPLE in chemistry (definitely not the subject!), I'll definitely miss journalism, and I may miss yearbook (right now I'm pissed about yearbook stuff so I'll prolly miss it around mid July). However, I'm really looking forward to next year. I'm working all this summer, save yearbook camp (if I go) and Puerto Rico, so I'm not gonna have much of a break. Most likely, I'll have them hold my job when I start school so I can do that harrowgate tutors thing. Anyway, back to senior year. I really hope I have lots of friends in my classes, cause I just found out that all the honors history are being bumped up to AP. I'm kind of hoping that I'll somehow still be in Z level, cause I may be with some friends and it won't be as difficult. There's a chance I may be, because I had drop and add three classes, so I wrote the Z level to Honors on the back. I'm also taking a journalism class, two publications (oh yea, I'm a newspaper freak, if u ever had ne doubts), AP English, AP Stat, either Z level or AP Government and Dual Enrollment Environmental Science and Marine Ecology.  Now do u see why I'm worried about history?  It's going to be extremely difficult to handle 3-4 college courses.   Well I'm gonna try and enjoy the little summer I'm gonna have. I went to the pool today, and while I'm brown on my hands when palms face downward, I'm white on the other side, even though I tanned with my palms facing up so I could get a little sun. I fell asleep while I was laying out, so I'm dreading what's going to happen to the back of my legs. Quick question before I end it - why do u never get burned under ur eyes? I have a cherry tomato-like stain across my nose and the apples of my cheeks, but nothing under my eyes. I'm getting some atrocious freckles, so I really need to start wearing sunscreen on my nose (I hate the stuff cause I never get a tan when I wear it). Later.
