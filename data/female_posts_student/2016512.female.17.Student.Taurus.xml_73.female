I was a little ashamed of all the unsportmanship going on. Oh well I protest with "Tax Cut" and "Health Care." Hazaah!  no earth shattering news today. i'm angry with pippin. grr he should really try a little bit more or else i'll jump him, (in an angry mob like fashion). Learn your lines and quit goofing off! So stupid, why did we get a sophomore to do it?  They call me Ralph, -Betso
