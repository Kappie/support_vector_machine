I cannot stand being accused of shit that I don't do, I am sick of her putting words in my mouth to make herself look better, and I'm sick of being her pawn! I'm sick of looking bad for her benefit! Being her friend is just flat bullshit these days! Shit! I don't need the drama from her, I don't need the drama from my ex R, I don't need these sorts of people holding my life back! I need to just get the balls up and tell her to go fuck herself. That's best for me. I have been dealing with her manipulation for years and years. Enough bullshit already!  I am just angry because I had a fight with my ex J (my high school sweetheart) because of some shit that R concluded that I said that, in reality, I did not say. I never implied that it was J's fault that R's boyfriend got himself into trouble...whatever. I am not getting involved in this "we" shit with my friends.  I just had a looooong talk with my roommate, so now I'm mellow, and therefore, this entry is a little less heated than it would've been had I finished this up when I was on fire and venting earlier. I simply need to get myself some new friends, and discard those that only hinder my life. I think I know what I have to do, just a little nervous to end an 11 year friendship. Can you blame me? I mean, it is detrimental to me to stay friends with her, but it is hard to cut it off cold turkey. Despite the bullshit, the entire friendship isn't bad, but mostly, it is. There are less redeeming qualities to this friendship as time passes. Oh well...I will figure this out.
