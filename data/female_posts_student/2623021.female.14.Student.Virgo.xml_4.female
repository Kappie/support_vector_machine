I mean sure, it's a great way to live... if you have a week to live, but us with more than a week of life left in us, we have to live with the repercusions of it. Cause and Effect young grasshopper, Cause and Effect. If I would have realized that around four months ago then life would have been easier. I thought that it was the way to live, and then I realized this school year, how I was wrong, I had a good friend, who because of me being stupid, has stopped talking to me all together. Man oh man, I used to like him so much too, I don't know what made me say those couple sentences months ago. Who knows what might have happened. I actually think that that was why I said it, because I liked him... oh well, I'll never do that again, Trial and Error. What goes up must come down... What about Attitudes, does that go along with that law? What if I die with a positive attitude? Although I don't think that is what he meant. But it is true. Eitherways, it's too late for my taste, and I have school tomorrow.
