Let's just say I don't trust myself that I could pull this off. The thing about me and basketball is I know "how" but I'm not really that "good" gets? Anyway, I have to go. I guess this is all for me today. I'll update you if anything "interesting" will happen to the life of yours and only Hannah Banana hehe =)
