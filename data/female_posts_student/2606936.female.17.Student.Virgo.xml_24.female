Instead of turning into my neighborhood after school, i drove past it to a little shopping center. I wanted to go to CVS to replace some cool heart-shaped mardi gras beads i accidently threw away today (don't even ask). However, finding none, I wandered around the center.  I went first into a little consignment store. I've never been to one before, despite living here for the greater part of my life. I poked around and tried on three little black dresses. Two were size 8 and waaaay too big. One was a "size 2" and yet looked strangely small on me..... still, it was nice. The dressing room was pretty. It had one of those accordion-fold doors and star-shaped hanger things on the walls.  Then I walked all the way down, past a Hallmark owned by these weird uptight Indian people who have all these signs like, "children should not be let in here unsupervised" and stuff. I went past a closed bar and a pizza place and a camera store.   And then I went into a little store whose tagline was "religious books and gifts."  I don't know why I went in. I think just seeing it there all those years and boredom and the fact that I was (and still am) wearing a tiara for the beginning of Karneval, made me step in.  I actually got a little freaked out when I pushed open the door. And working in retail myself, I found it surprising that they didn't greet me when I came in. The lady was chatting to some customer.  I saw a bunch of books, for children, like "Gross and WEird Bible Stuff" and "Bible Weapons and Wars." I saw pamphlets about pornography and abortion. I saw books on prayer in marriage and YA fiction series about adventures and stuff. Books on "apologetics," which I now assume to be the art of justifying Christianity, or something. (It was like, Apologetics 2.5: YES, YOU SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE TRINITY: Speaking With Jehovah's Witnesses.) There were rosary beads in all colors and frames and little "TEEN CREED" things. There were little wallet-sized cards proclaiming the dangers of abortion and "Your Baby's Growth," with drawings of fetuses and stuff. There was one bookmarks with a picture of a little thing in a blob with some hands, and it said "Living X-old fetus from ectopis pregnancy." ANd on the back, "A person's a person, no matter how small. - Dr. Seuss"  So yeah. All these things that normally make me mad - I mean, I'm not married and not exactly virginal, and i'm pro-choice to the point of anger. And I don' know what the hell a rosary is, and I don't care about prayer or pictures of God or whatever.  I felt like an impostor, masquerading as a sweet little Christian, when I'm really just a heathen curious to see what the store's all about.  I'm not drawn to religion at all. It just seems tedious and meaningless to me. Which is why I haven't picked one.  But it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere. No God-Squadders shoving things in my face, blessing me, asking me if I'm saved. (Although there was a pamhplet on that last one.) I think if I was religious, I'd have a store like that where people can come to sit and read.   Although maybe not next to giant plastic Mary statues.
