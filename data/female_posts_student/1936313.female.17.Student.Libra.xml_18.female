I went a full day without a headache today.... got home.... got the mail and..........  I have my official acceptance into MHC....... officially........ "Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Medicine Hat College in the UT-Journalism & Communications Program."..... Thats... fantastic... Its also expensive..... very expensive.....  And I haven't heard a peep from Grant MacEwan.....  I feel sick.. my stomachs right up in knots now. Registration for MHC started on April 16th... I have to grab my courses......  I haven't heard a thing from Grant MacEwan.....  CRAP!.....
