Why do I fret over the ones I love but not even care of the ones I do not know? Why do I care so much about what one guy thinks of me then suddenly he is gone, away from my presence. Whisked away never to be seen again.   How can I feel wonderful then suddenly go into a deep depression?   I just don't understand.  Yesterday I felt beautiful. I felt like the world was watching my every step.  Now I feel like a thorn on the bush, a mistake, never ment to happen.  I feel like when the world sees me they quickly look away. They don't even stop to talk.   All this because of one persons oppions. One persons scorn.  You may not have known how much you can effect one person. You can change there life.  Make that change.  Do the right.  You will be rewareded.   You don't evenhave to save there life.  Just say hi.  Smile.  Give them a  call, a hug. Anything really.   You don't know how much that little friendly emotion will do for that person.
