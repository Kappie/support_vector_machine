I had to wait 45 mins to puke because I knew I was going to so might as well get it over. I only Puked once at that party. In my whole drinking career which was just started when I was 15, I've only puked 3 times counting the one last night. And the last two times I puked for hours on end. But other than puking I had fun. Everyone is usually irritated because they are drunk sept me, but this time only one kid was. He said the reason for his assholeness was because he hadn't seen me in a while so he wanted to make sure to make up for it. The FUCKER! Well now I'm home and bored to death and I have school tomorrow that I don't want to go to. I want to because I ran for Student council Prez and I think I am the only one that ran which in away is good but I didn't want it just handed over to me. Well whatever happens happens. I'm going to go and fulfill being border. Bye bye  jeno
