Rather upsetting that I need a startling 11 hours of sleep while I usually only get 6 hours of sleep during the semester. Adding to my strange sleep routine, I eat irregularly (well duh, since I wake up so late in the day!), and hardly exercise. The only exercises I do now are: one, getting from my room to the living room couch to watch whatever is on TV; and two, getting up from my desk to change a CD that was playing in my hi-fi.    The movie I saw this afternoon was  Maid In Manhattan .   I give it a B-. I'd give it a C for the highly-predictable storyline that makes you go, "aww, not that shit again," but I rather like Ralph Fiennes, the Romeo in the movie :) He is most definitely a sign of British sexuality :) Jennifer Lopez is actually somewhat convincing on her role. She is a better actress than Britney Spears and Mariah Carey put together!   While I'm at it, I'll do another movie review (lol). I watched  Bend It Like Beckham  the other night. Good comedy! I give it an A, and yes, the main guy in the movie (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer) did help promote the movie to this grade! (Sorry, guys with accents -- especially British and Irish...  Are irresistible to me!)  I don't have any complaints about this movie, except that the cameo of Beckham and his lovely wife, Victoria, was too short.     That is all for today.  The critic is off to take a shower...
