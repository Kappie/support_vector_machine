Well, maybe when you get lucky, you'll have a few interesting ways of learning the topic being taught. If not.. never will get interested manx. However, its still up to oneself to pay attention or not. Okx.. Cut the school stuff. 

Hmm.. May I know what do you all understand by the term 'life'? Or wad do u learn in life? I always wonder that. Okx.. Nevermind. I'm super tired already. Me going to take a shower n head for my assignments nanx! ~chIlL~
