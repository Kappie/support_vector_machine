Twisting in an arc of  Shimmering pain  watch a picture  Of a young girl  Weeping quietly  Over a pond of glass  taste the salt in her heavy lashes as she  Makes a deal with the devil  Tearing petals from their flowers  All the while making circles  In the still waters  As diamond rain falls  From eyes of black  To waters green  And she creates fountains of red  To see if still she bleeds   Comments and their commentors are loved very much. and appreciated. please send them to Delirious_dreaming@yahoo.com
