You went away .Ever since, my mind has been exploding with a unique jealousy, wondering in which mind you now take up shelter.  Why did you leave?  I needed you, but I never showed it, is this why you left me with the others? you were one I could always stand to have in my head, but I got bored of you easily It would seem. You helped me a lot with my unimportant crap, things that I thought I couldn't tell anyone, and I couldn't but you knew.  I hope you never return!  When you saw the fountain of youth you said you cared, and this would seem true but what of when my eyes were shut, were your thoughts always so comforting, this I have always doubted. You left when I thought we were the closest we'd ever been. You resented me, didn't you?  Why would I care?  You were part of me for a while, like my child. Letting you go was the most difficult decision I ever had to make, but it was for my sanity, for my well being and for those around me. I can't be the person you made me, forever.    One says:  I hate you too much  One asks:  will you be there for me ever again?  One says:  I miss you too much   All the others just glare.          ....confused? i hope so     Rhedyn   "Nevermore"
