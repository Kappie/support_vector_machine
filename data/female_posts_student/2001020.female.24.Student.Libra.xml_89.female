I sat down and tried to write a letter to your memory My pen wouldn't get past the puddles collecting pools of never-beens And every time I want to take a hard look in the mirror My mind just slides back to you instead Voices knocking at my door, but I refuse to answer 'Cause I'm naked and shivering on the bathroom floor And life is still refusing to hand me my dinner So I'll be licking photographs instead Now, who is the man who told me to trust my own shadow? I never gave it more thought than right now Because it follows me everywhere, and dances with the sunlight But I can't find it when I'm looking 'round He will sit and turn to me, he likes me more than some things But I just cry into the couch's arm He says, "Little baby, can you tell me what's the matter?" I just close my eyes till he's gone Turning, chilling, jumping, yes my throat is still on fire Is there something else I should be seeing? Brits and pies and brandywine, oh yes, I must be bleeding Culture and popularity So feed me just one love affair that leaves me much too full Help me grapple with the blues and whites There's always one more gentleman that I should be misleading Lest the devils militate my mind
