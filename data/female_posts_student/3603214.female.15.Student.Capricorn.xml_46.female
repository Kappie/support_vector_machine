Well, the fam's been talkin bout him coming home again. I think it's crap...w/e. And then I finally decide to watch the movie b4 we gotta take it back. I open it and TADA! A receipt. But my father's name isn't on the receipt. Oh no, it's Kate's. So I woke my mom up and told her. I reminded her that I'm always right, that Dad won't change. So I called him at like midnight and we had a onesided conversation. I did all the talking. So we decided to have a talk Saturday afternoon. I ended up not getting sleep because my schedule's screwed up. So my mom and I went out to Belleville...it was madness...we ended up going to a flea market thing. It was hella nifty, but my left leg like died on me so I couldn't walk that well. I decided to call myself Gimpy. I got some old records to decorate my room w/. Got some KC and the Sunshine Band, Commodores, and like 3 more. It's nifty. I need to go to those things more often. Then we went to this antique store because they were having a sale on old movie posters. They were all crap. We wasted a good five minutes looking at those damn things. So since I was literally dying from hunger, lack of sleep, and a leg that didn't work, we went home. Padre came over at like noon. I don't remember a lot of the conversation because I was pretty much out of it. I do remember telling him that when I look at him I see a stranger. I see a godless man. And I know that I told him that he doesn't have faith and that it shows. If he was a man of God, he wouldn't do half the things he does. And I told him that I want to sit down and have a talk with Kate. I tried to find a nicer word than "homewrecker", but it wasn't coming in my fatigue. The stories ended up getting repeated and that pissed me off so I yelled at them that I was going upstairs because I didn't care. And during my yelling, Dad was like AMY! And I retorted an annoyed WHAT?! And he stood up and came over to me, hugged me and said I just wanted to say I love you. I was in like semi-shock. I didn't know what to say so I marched upstairs, went to my bed, and cried out of confusion. I then looked at some pictures and that cheered me up. I fell asleep to I Love the 90s repeats. Go figure. And I slept from about 2 something til 1 something. Be proud. I caught up on some sleep, but I'm like still blah. Modest Mouse was on VH1 AND MTV at the same time. That was wacky. And now Badly Drawn Boy's Year of the Rat is on MTV. I don't get that song...w/e..I'm gonna go because I think my mom stirred...
