I stayed with Melissa when it was her shift with Isaac. He is such a smart, happy, funny little boy! Oh yea and he has the cutest little cheeks!! Saturday my mom, kate, and myself took Melissa to eat lunch at Applebee's on the riverfront. It was so pretty. The river is nasty, but it's definitly a pretty view! Sunday Isaac got discharged to the Ronald McDonald House. He was so excitied. We played outside and just hung around the room. Sammy was making butt noises, but thats okay, he's special!  OPPS, i gotta go get ready for school. I'll post more later! ByE
