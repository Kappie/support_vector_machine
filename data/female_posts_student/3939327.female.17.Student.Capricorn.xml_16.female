You might not want to donate money because you aren't certain where the money is going, but look at it differently. I came across that web page by chance, and instead of ignoring it, I'm going to do something. Without people like us to help one another, what state will our world be in? Knowing that the gift I gave out was intended for a good cause is ample reason for me. Please hurry, Ling does not have much time. They need the money by  Wednesday, September 1st , 2004. Thank you.
