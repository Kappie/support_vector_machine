I'm so excited! i've been trying to find stuff to do before they get home, but I'm not patient enough. i keep running to the windows expecting them to be driving with my aunt down the hill to our house any minute!! argh!  but they're not here yet. hm. oh well.  i have so much to do. i locked my cupbord last night and i tried to open it this morning and it won't budge. my jewelry, tiffany's included, and all my scrapbooking stuff were in that cabinet.  i'm hoping my mom can get it open. anyway, i got a french penpal yesterday. her name is lor. she's really cool. anyway, i have to go, i'll write back later.
