I'm not supposed to be up before noon, especially since I went to bed last night at 3:30. I have to go finish painting at the Bayou House. We missed a wall. Of course, the woman wakes me up at 8 even though all I had to do was eat, so of course I choose to sit here on the computer and waste time. Ugh, this garage sale is going exactly as I had expected. No one is doing anything, and Rachel's complaining. I feel psychic, but I'm only psychic on Tuesdays. I think my system may be awry because I woke up so early today. How did I get so weird?!?!
