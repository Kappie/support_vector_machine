I'm going to start over, theres four weeks left of holiday then back to school, new start, new people, new everything     Its like the last year was a big waste, like it only happened to show me that I'm a shite person and that I aint worthy of having anyone there to care for me and from now on, I don't want it to be about me relying on other people, I want it to be about me and doing what I want to do and being happy for what I am..not just who I am when I'm trying to make others happy..     All I ever do is pick out the bad points in everyone else, I never stop to think what other people think about me, then when I do find out, its like a big punch in the face, like how could my friends think of me like that, but what kind of person am I if it leads them to be thinking of it in the first place..     When did I start caring so much about myself and not about other people?
