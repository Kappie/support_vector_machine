       
      Well shoot, I've been absent, perhaps just absent minded, for about... uh, well, at least the last few months. So, here is an update of everything! (Sorry to Miranda, Irene, and Jessica, because I know you are always looking for updates! Thanks to Miranda for the footprint on my butt (figuritively speaking).  Okay... well, the weekend after my last blog was an exciting one. I got to hang out w/ Jessica, someone I never get to hang with, but really enjoy the company of. Anyway, the we went out drinking from about 6pm to about 2 am.... and I discovered that evening that I really dont like getting hit on by crazy drunk guys, because all of a sudden my name became Rebecca and I was engaged! Oh the things that you will do when hit on by a crazy redneck who is about 40.   Then, the most signifigant thing that followed was definately  Thanksgiving weekend . Yeah, it was fun. Irene, Scott and I got to hang out Tuesday night like old times. What is sad, however, we were up before 8am (influences of the real world) Wed. morn. However, for the first time since.. uh.. who knows... I had MickyD's B'fast. Irene and I went up to Atlanta to see Pulse, A Stomp Oddessy on IMAX, and we both agreed anyone with any interest in international studies OR music should see it. Needless to say, I liked it - and I do hope it comes out on film eventually. Irene and I followed that with working the ATL Marathon  Half-Marathon and First Aid Volunteers, and then it was off to my house for a traditional Chewning holiday. Irene got an education in my family's traditions. We went to the tree farm to get a tree (actually 3 farms), and watched the traditional Thanksgiving night "movie that Richard gets to select because he thinks he runs the house", and of course, the Orchard Hill Lights. (NOT as fancy as it sounds!)  Then this follows up with  VSO . We had a successful VSO xmas concert. Mom, Dad, MC and Ryan (Hey! whats up?!) came to see me and the concert. I topped off the sequence by falling of the top riser and really f~ing up my back... pulled out the old back brace for about 2 days, just to let it heal.. which it did, no worries. (But I did scare HR when I told them about the fall - I guess they were freaked out that I was going to sue.)   This is followed up by a sequence of really  BAZAAR  things.    1) [Deleted for privacy]   2. I went to Clewiston!  This was a great trip, really, thats about what I can say. I went for Irene's concert, (first I might add, and really good), went to WPB to shop and see LOTR III. Whoo-hoo! I loved it. And then got to do a master class (!?) with her 6th graders. They are cute. We had a really good time, and I do miss seeing her on a daily basis. (hence, maybe way I'm going nuts afterall!)   IN THE MEANTIME  I move to a new apt. 900 Cherokee, Caroline's old place... I love it! And I get two cats too! Sassy and Buff! So sweet!   3. I totaled a snowmobile!  Yeah, so exactly how many people do this? Apparently, according to the insurance company, alot!. Yeah, so I was behind Richard, who never knew of it until we got back to "base" because he wasn't watching behind him... and Dad was behind me, dragging behind so he didnt see the event, but definately got to see the aftermath. Yeah... You cant steer on ice. On a path wide enough for one "sled" I hit a curve that was a sheet of ice, went into the plowed ice bank, and launched the 3 day old, 10 running hrs sled into two trees, effectively folding it. Very sad. Very expensive. Oops. Damn. Well, I could have been killed, I'm glad I let go once airborne! I landed correctly, flat on back! and Dad stopped before running over me, and Vladimir, the Russian who lives in Japan that vacations in Canada took pictures. The last ski track to the tree measured 8 ft... quite a ways when going 25 mph. Lucky chick I am.   4. Major Change!  So I get to my PR class to find that its canceled, and this is a very important class that I have to have SPR 04 to graduate anytime in any future. Noticing my extreme distress, Matson Topper (bless you!) suggested I go to Dr. Adler and see if I qualify for a GENS degree due to my massive hours in MUSC and COMM. Well... YES. I can get out by AUG! So, with a quick change, and adding German for my final language requirement, I just might get out a semester or two early! I LOVE DR. ADLER! By the way Jessica, I "name dropped" you so he would know that I'm not a total looser!  (meaning, if he knows we are friends, maybe he will think I'm a half way decent student - which I'm not!!)     5. GMEA  Really, what else can I say? Actually I got to see Denmon and Gunter which was really really cool. I miss those two. Denmon is quitting music! what the hell? Actually I dont blame him... 20 (?) years as a high school band director is probably enough! Also got to see Greg, Kyle, and Casey (love ya'll!)   6. I got kidnapped  by my best gay friend (I'll leave your name anon for ya!) and taken to a gay club in Jax. I had so much fun... total stress relief.    7. Jeff  contacts me and "cools things over". Weird... Wonder what will become of it.   8. Andy  Yeah I had a boyfriend from Thurs to Tues. Andy you're a great guy, but its not going to work, at least now... (waiting for Jessica to call - she'll want the dirt on this one!) This is what happens when you ask a girl who's been single (almost forever) out on Valentine's week. I kindly refer to this as my Britney Spears weekend. 'Nough said.  What else? I also went to Destin w/ SAI - that was a really really cool weekend. I hope we get to do it again! Feb VSO was great, except Stravinsky Ebony Concerto, that sucked! (not the soloist, the ensemble!) I love my new apt. I love the cats.   Here is my "deep" thinking... now that I'm done w/ the actual history of the last few months, which I'm sure I've left something out... sorry!  No... maybe I shouldnt say this...  well... shoot.  I am kinda freaked out that I am job hunting now. I'm looking at all these jobs and I dont know what to do. Options: 1) Foreign Service (If I actually am accepted as one of the 400 taken, from the 70000 that apply) 2) Fine Arts Management (where I really want to go) and 3) Peace Corps. I get upset being away from friends for two days.... TWO YEARS???? AM I UP TO THAT?  FREAKED OUT STILL.  Quotes:    Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.  ~Shakespeare   Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.  ~Earl Russell   So there are no more words and all is ended; The timbrel is stilled, the clarion laid away; And Love with streaming hair goes unattended Back to the loneliness of Yesterday.  ~Joseph Auslander  I think this is all for now... I'll be back soon - I promise.
