There were a few people I did not get the chance to say goodbye to, but I imagine summer get togethers will occur. For others I know communication will cease for three months. {but its almost better this way}  In the mail I recieved my camp counselor papers, mom picked me up an application for Northrock 14 and I just finished freshman year.  God, I feel old.   Won't you take a walk outside? Oh no. Can't you find some other guy? Oh no. 1 9 6 3, whats that sound? Oh no. Keeping down the underground... oh no!
