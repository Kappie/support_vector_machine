My mother once offered me the chance to get a boob job to enhance my self confidence, but I refused because I work really hard to maintain a natural athletic/actually big boned appearance...Really, I think I refused because from the waist up, I consider myself pretty petite but if I tried to make myself more top heavy (which I have tried with toilet paper and small pillows...damn those drunken girlie sleepovers), I look absolutely mammoth, so I refused...1/2 a chance is better than none...  ok, 1/2 a chance at what one might wonder beyond the world of porn (no knocks against porn, I support this quite avidly, see previous entry)...the world is sold immediately by a beautiful face with a beautiful body...obvious observation, nothing mind blowing here...but what about on the professional circuit...and even more obviously when trying to shape yourself as a person...I mean you just don't have to be an overachiever when most things are just handed to you...you just don't have to be witty or charming, nor do you have to have the right bag or blouse...If you looked like this you could be picking a wedgie dressed in Hanes and cue ball pajama pants and well...tadaaa you have porn...or better yet, a great job, friendly people all around you, and you would never have to lift anything over five pounds..(oh dont worry biceps can be implanted...)  I have had to overcome this serious demerit I was handed for shoving while I was waiting in the registration line for a kick ass exterior in the Great Beyond, so I worked it the best way I knew how, I developed a smart mouth instead of "jolie" lips, a mind filled with useless tidbits about every subject in the book to "connect", instead of GGG Cups...Well ladies and gentlemen...for no freaking good reason except to be considered the girl with the great personality...  We all know the grass is greener, and right now I don't want to hear about these women who are saying, "I just wish they would take me seriously..", or how about the great personality chicks who go for the implants...and don't look mammoth...doubly don't care...cuz they're doubly blessed, and well those who are built this way naturally and were born to a Pulitzer Prize Winner and Bill Gates, well they can just combust...wow I'm really in a mean spirit today...or everyday just something new to bitch about  I want to be the Video Girl, for five days...just five days...the scantily clad, perfect bangs having, drop dead gorgeous just oogled at for her body and her next appearance in another video..you know the video girl...I want to know what it feels like to not have to say one thing...i'm making assumptions I know...but it's my wish, right...I'm taking the arrogance thing a little too far...I would just sit, smile, drape off of Jay-Z, cross and uncross my legs, adjust my skirt height occasionally with a random biting my french manicured fingers, and stare into a camera through Dior shades...Just five days, I'm sure I would be blogging after that again...with fewer words and maybe in this world fewer complaints.
