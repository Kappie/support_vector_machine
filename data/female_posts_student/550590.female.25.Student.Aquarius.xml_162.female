God, I think that's an inside joke from drama class in high school...which means no one reading this will get it. Hmm...  Tomorrow Bruce and I leave for our Cruise to the Bahamas. No, Ryan, we will  not  be getting married while we're there...you need three days in the bahamas and a blood test for that. :)  Back to packing. Then a few hours sleep...hopefully. Cheers!  Harry Potter Quote of the Day:   "From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a 12 foot mountain troll is one of them..."    --Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone aka Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
