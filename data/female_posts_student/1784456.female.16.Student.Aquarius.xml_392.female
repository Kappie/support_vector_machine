I'm having all these sudden bursts of artistic energy and i should have spent the last 2hours revising but instead i spent it slaving over a spontanious masterpiece and making a big mess with the charcoal. I think my hormones are going crazy. I just want to say... I love you guys. All of you... but I HATE YOU!!! I want to be alone... Chocolate... Oh hi everyone!! Having a nice day!? Whoopeee! Ok ok, i'll shuttup now.
