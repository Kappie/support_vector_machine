I think I enjoy being single too much. I'm such a flirt. Don't get me wrong, that had nothing to do whith why I broke up with him. Well, it was taken into consideration, but it wasn't the deciding factor.  I love being a teenager sometimes. Minus school and work and whatnot. I wish my whole life was summer vacation. I enjoy defying my dad and doing stuff I know he wouldn't want me to do and would certainly kill me for if he ever found out. It's a wonderful feeling. The rush of adrenaline is enticing.  So back to being a huge flirt. That's right, I'm a flirt. Before Dave, I was afraid to hug a guy. But now, I wouldn't be suprised if I found myself trying to get down someone's throat. It kindof sickens me. But flirting is still fun. I have yet to kiss anyone who isn't family or boyfriend (minus Lane, but she doesn't count). And I'm sure I can control myself. But now every one I know are potential victims to my hugging and cuddling and whatnot. Especially Ryan. Gawd, I hate hormones, but I love them at the same time. The rest of this summer is going to be quite interesting...   Current Mood:  Flirty
