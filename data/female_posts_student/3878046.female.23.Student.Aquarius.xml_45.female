In knoxville, Tennessee of all places! so I think I need to dedicate a lot of space to this and there is a lot of catching up to be done, but as I am a lazy git indeed I will do that at some point but not right now.  To start I am going to post some poems and shit that I wrote so you can all get a laugh.  Gotta put it somewhere so it might as well be here.
