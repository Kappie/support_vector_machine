I had alot of fun - definitely needed to do that. We then followed that up with the ultimate of chick flicks,  Love Actually . That movie gets me every time I see it. What can I say? I'm a hopeless mess. Overall though, great day! Thanks Miranda for dragging me out!!!!  Wed-Friday afternoon consisted of PANIC. Finals suck - and I had alot on the line. Ugh. Sometimes I let these things get to me too easily - and sometimes I'm a fool and beat myself over the head with them. Oh well. They are over - this time.   Friday evening was nice. I went out w/  Caroline  and her friends. Don't usually get to hang w/ them - and they are a cool bunch of folks. Also saw  Andy  while I was there - thanks for the hug Andy! Red Lobster was followed up by going to  Relay for Life  w/  SAI . It was fun - but I was really too tired to do anything productive other than hold a flashlight for the others. Some of the guys came out to support us, and that was cool. Thanks to  Eric  and  Abadia  (spell??) for dressin' in drag for all's entertainment - and thanks to  CC, Rick, Jerry and Phillip  for coming out too. Sorry if I left someone out. While there I had a meaningful conversation with  Debbie  and  Ashley , glad I did - its good to keep up w/ friends.  I then came home to find a party at my neighbors - so I chilled w/ them for a bit, and then my roommate  Caroline  , boyfriend  Jeremiah  and brother  Edward  got home. The four of us chilled out for a while, and then it was me and  Edward . We stayed up rather late just hanging out. That was cool.   Over the last few days:  Debbie : it was great to see you at the UC - best laugh I've had in a while.  Jarrett : you keep me sane more than you know!  Irene : I'm sorry I woke you up!  Scott : thanks for the email!  Caroline  and friends: thanks for taking me out!  Miranda : Thanks for the great day!  Rick : Thanks for the hug!  Andy : Thanks for the hug!  Justin : Thanks for the hug! (hehe, I like hugs!)  Dr. Coons : Thanks for scaring the ever living hell out of me (sarcasm) regarding expulsion.  Its possible I left someone out.... if so, I'm sorry.   CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE THAT GRADUATED TODAY!!!!
