I love you even more than I did before, But darling, what can i do? For you don't love me, And I'll always be Crying over you, crying over you. Yes, now you're gone, And from this moment on, I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying.   It's not the same without him singing.  Orbison's a vocal genius.   urlLink Go here to listen .  Have to search for the song, but if you don't have a copy, it's worth it.
