I think that it everyone. There was this awesome spinning ride that we rode 3 times, then there was a ferris wheel that we rode 2 times. The second time me, Cassie, and Dani were stopped at the top and we flashed everyone. Also there is this upsidedown ride and there were bumper cars. It was awesome. Then afterwards we went to Sonic. We hung out there and met some guys from Taylor. One said that he kenw Brian :) Another said that he pulled a knife on Jared Hankins and spent 3 months in prison. Eeek.   Then Brian met me there, and we went to Westheimer. Raced a bit. Then we went to to Ellen's for about 20 minutes. THen he dropped me off at my house. Yeah, it was fun. :)
