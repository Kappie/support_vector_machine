It's our choice to listen or not. If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring; He sends you a sunrise every morning. God didn't promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, But He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way.   "Called her midweek... Always couldn't help it... Things are getting complicated and i'm not getting better... Just that i never show it on the surface. Nobody knows how i'm feeling inside... None of my friends knew... I don't know what to do with her anymore... Everything seems wrong... Someone... I wished someone could save me from this........."   Is this me? Geez..I hope not.. well.. he (not the Stonehenge he) didn't call me midweek.. he called on monday.. and we didnt talk for the rest of last week until saturday.. hmmmz.. maybe it's ede he's referring to.. But if it's me then I did him great wrong.. as in first I go.. really I can't love no one. Then the next thing tat happens is, I get real guilty then I'd call to ask if he's alright or he'd call cos he can't help it..and we start talking again.. and when we don't meet up, I'd miss him (I don't tell him tat..) But I just really don't want to lose him. He's been my great, great pal for 5 years! geez.. do u know how long that is..? He's probably thinking like wat's up with you.. make up your mind.. geez.. wat to do.. wat to do..
