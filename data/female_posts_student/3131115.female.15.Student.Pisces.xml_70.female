Yesterday I told him that I wouldnt go swimming with my cousins and shit..and I did and he got mad because I "lied" to him...yet, I didnt realize that the lake was clean and that they had a Paddle Boat. I jumped in the middle of the lake, and rode in a tube accross half of it. Something I probably would have never done if I werent with my cousins. I am deathly afraid of deep water...and I jumped in. The water probably being insanely deep. Im not talking...10 feet..I'm talking..a LOT more. My cousin is also deathly afraid of spiders..and on the other side of the lake across from where their house was..there was a 'slide'. (We're not sure if it really was used as a slide, but it was a large tube leading into the water. Inside the tube were many many BIG spiders..ones that looked like they could bite you very very easily. She stole a step stool thing, and she climbed up there and went down it. She did it, even though there was a LARGE spider web across the hole at the end of the tube. So we both did something and it was nice. So anyway, I had a really good time, and I'm proud of myself so obviously I'm going to get mad if bill tells me that he's mad because I lied to him about it. It's not like I cheated on him and lied to him about it..(again). But anyway..so we started fighting. My cousin, dresses in short shorts and skimpy shirts and she's one of (those) kinds of people...yet, she listens to some music that I listen to. I was telling Bill that, and he called her a Poser. He's never met her before..but he called her a poser..and this is why I am mad. People like "bill" and.. 'me'...and everyone who dresses at hot topic and shit think they have the right to call people posers. I never hear any so called "preppy" people call anyone posers, because they dont give a shit. But Bill had the nerve. He's like "they dont feel the music. They love themselves so it angers me" "they shouldnt be listening to that kind of music if they love themselves because most of the people singing that they listen to sing about hating themselves so they cant feel it"...but I think he's wrong. I guess being one of (those) people my entire life..I understand better than Bill ever will. When I was like that, I hated myself. he thinks that all these "preppy" girls Love themselves and shit..but I know different. I'm not saying all dont..because a LOT of girls do love themselves and are infact conceided..but some are not. I guess I pretty much HAD to love myself back then..I didnt really, I hated who I was..but I was forced to be "selfish"...I had to love who I was because nobody else accepted me any different. When I was popular..I had to do shit for it. I had to do shit for people to like me..I had to be good looking for people to like me. Yeah, I was good looking back then..but when I didnt do anything with myself people told me that I was ugly. Do you think it was easy? No..It wasnt. And I'm not talking like...little school and stuff. I'm talking middle school..5th 6th 7th and half of 8th grade..that's what I was. It wasnt easy for me...and I didnt like it. When I was dating Justin, and best friends with Cierra, i hated myself..and they were the first people that I told openly. I mean, Amber and Marrah knew that I hated myself, because I always said it..but people on the outside think Im happy..no shit, I put on a fake smile. I'm sure a lot of "popular" "preppy" girls feel the same way I did..if not then I must have been crazy. But Bill will never understand..He will never ever know what it's like. Nobody like "him" really thinks about it either...they just think they're better than everyone else and think that they have the right to call everyone else a poser. haha...they HATE themselves yet they make themselves feel like they're BETTER!! Everyone-even popular people strive to be something better..yet they say they dont. Especially people like "us"..we are the devil. It is people like us who are picky, and dont let things go..and judge everyone else yet say we dont. On vampirefreaks.com all the girls are like Dislikes: Stupid people, ignorant people...yet they're judging people..and being ignorant themselves. It's like..they go out of their way to let people know that they hate stupid people. They may not THINK that they want people to think BETTER of them...but they do. Everyone thinks their cool...especially people like "us" not all of us..because some of us really do hate ourselves...but most.   I told my cousin about *you*..and she seemed kind of disgusted, but I dont really care. That doesnt bother me..we live two different lives..although she's still cool. She may be a tad bit close minded, but I dont blame her..I blame the people she hangs out with. i know that if she hung out with me for a while..she wouldnt think that way anymore. It's all in who you grow up with. I know that's not supposed to make a difference, and you're just supposed to be who you are..but you learn who you are from someone...you dont just all of a sudden know things. I mean, music wise too...our teachers and parents (well most) dont teach their kids about which music to listen to..and what it means...and all that shit.   Anyway..my thoughts are being put to rest, because I am going to see Bill...I dont know what it's going to turn into..but I'm going to see him today..
