I guess I should get back to work... I wonder how much coffee it's going to take to get feeling back into my arms...  urlLink My opinion counts  is a good blog. Read the latest posts. The guy did what he thought of the presidential address, I am going to do it too... not to mention the funny news stories on his page:    urlLink Man robs a bank with a branch...    urlLink Kid uses wrong bullets to rob a store   *update for someodd reason it's  4:00am  [second update] 5:18AM and I am still awake... oh yea... only a couple more  gays  days.
