The air conditioner was a piece of shit, there was no pool, and the bathroom was the size of a small closet (if that!) It was just gross. I can not wait until we move into our new house. New surroundings, new people, new house, new everything! I can't wait. Change is definetly a good thing!!! But I will miss all my friends but I've only got like 2 close friends and the rest are really just acquaintences. (Did I spell that right?) Besides, new school=new guys. Yay!!! I'm trying to get over Joe and hopefully this will help. From what I've heard though, UT is a homosexual and lesbian school. God I hope not! I don't have anything against gays and lesbians because I have a lot of gay friends. It's just that I want a boyfriend too! I'm sure there will be tons of hot guys though. Let's cross our fingers and hold our breath!
