Where to start? Well, like it says above, it is indeed Sunday, and yesterday was indeed Saturday.  What did I do Saturday? I'll tell you what I did...I picked up fricken trash around the school...all you lazy people's trash that can't bother to throw it in the trashcan 10 feet away, yes, thats right, YOU.  I'm sure it wasn't all your trash though so I forgive you.  Guess what I found? Over by the parent loop in the bushes there was a 12 pack of coors light...hmmm...makes you wonder.  Oh and I never really noticed all the cigarette buds around the school until now.  But it wasn't that bad, I got 2 service hours for only 30 minutes of work...and plus it wasn't really that hard.  I cheated and went to the band and asked for their trash...bwa hahaha.  Yea..and I was suppose to goto work today, but as soon as I got there they told me to go home....sooo here I am writing this.  Lets see what else is there to say...school sucks....work sucks...just the usual.  I'm trying to think of interesting stuff to put here but all I'm doing is putting that I'm trying to think about interesting stuff...which means I'm thinking about writing this and not about interesting stuff....wtf?...yea..............................yeaaa........... So it says a couple blogs down that we're going to be TMNTs for halloween...thats gonna be awesome (or is it?).  I'm definitely Donetello (spelling?), cause I'll have a big wooden stick that I'll use to beat the little kids with to steal their candy...yes thats right I'm taking innocent childrens candy so there.  Not much else to say really, I'm bored out of my mind...  Hey look I hit enter twice...go me.  Yes I'm that bored.  OH...go Dallas Stars! 5-2 victory against Phoenix Coyotes last night...stars rule.  Team is much better without Belfour in my opinion....  This is where I start rambling about random things that are stupid and pointless...and the beauty of it all is that you guys will still keep reading because you want to know what I'm gonna say! So instead, to spite you guys, I'm not gonna say what I was gonna.  Actually I'm getting tired of typing and I can't think of anything else and I think I've probably made enough grammar mistakes to make even Ms Peddy cry (thats a lot considering she doesn't know what a grammar mistake is).  So...until we next meet.....  -Habibi
