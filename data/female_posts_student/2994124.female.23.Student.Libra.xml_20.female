Think flatmates are getting ready for a night out. They don't actually go out often to be fair, but think for some reason they are in for a big session tonight. They are listening to cheesy love songs, drinking and singing loudly - save me!  Feeling rather ill - have just eaten too many chocolate chip cookies! But they were yummy!!
