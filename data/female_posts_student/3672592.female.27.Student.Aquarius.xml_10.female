I am so excited that things are starting to fall into place. We have set the ticket prices until Dec 1 the price is single $50 and couple $90. After Dec 1 single $60 and couple $100. Finally at the door the price is single $70 and couple $110. This way we can make sure we have enough money for everything. We don't think we'll have much if any money left over. I am so supprised how much things cost these days. The banquet hall, the dj, the food prices are going up  and up. Becuase of the prices of the tickets we probably won't have much decorations becuase of the price of everything else.
