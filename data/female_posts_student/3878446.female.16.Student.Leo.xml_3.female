But no...I came downstairs to find that my dad was once again watching a Western.  I realized that westerns are as plentiful as trees in Yellowstone National Park and like my mother once said...seen one tree seen them all.  This definitely applies with Westerns.    The men always look dirty no matter what.  Does no one believe in showers?    The good guy always seems to go thru 20 guys, shoot them all, and come out completely unharmed...is that realistic in any way?    Random people always get hung, and even more random people always like to watch it.  How sadisatic were they!?  Women are hardly involved and if they are, they are practically helpless!  I won't even get started on this one.     There is more to come...I promise, lol.
