I've never gotten below a C in this school.. in the middle school the lowest grade was a C-.. but thats gonna change. Cuz as of next year i'm studying REALLY hard n do my best. I think i've dont real well in trying hard, but that doesnt mean it gets me ne where. my grandfather has pneumonia. I think he gave me a sore throat, cuz before he was sick and it turned into pneumonia. instead of leaving tommorow they're leaving saturday morning.. cuz he's got oxygen n everything. ne way, g2g. ttyl.
