Whenever the traffic slows down on that particular street, I start reading the tombstones. It’s an old cemetery, all occupied. Depending on the exact point the traffic slows down, you get a chance to view only so many stones. At the start of the road, there are the oldest tombs, with names and dates and what else written on them in Arabic. Then further up come the relatively younger tombs, say from the start of the century and this goes on till the other end of the road where you have the most recent ones the inhabitants of which deceased in the 90s.   Today, the traffic slowed down closer to the beginning of the road where the turn of the century stones stand. I saw this one stone which I have never recognized before. It belonged initially to a man who lived between 1902 – 1931. Died young. However, it also said on the stone that his beloved wife was buried there as well so that they could lie in each other’s arms for all eternity. The surprising thing was that the wife was buried in 1999. She was married to a man who died at the age of 29 and she outlived him 68 long years. 68 years of life without the man she loved, yet it appears that she never remarried and wished to be buried where he was. 68 years is longer than the life some get to live.   I thought about the type of life she may have had. Maybe she had given him children before his 29 years and maybe those children were her consolation for the remaining 68 years of her life. But again, maybe they were just married when he died and she did not even get to say good-bye. Maybe they were childhood sweethearts who married when they were still children and had no offspring. Who knows? I will try next time to see whether there are other stones nearby belonging to members of the same family. Maybe then will I get to learn more.
