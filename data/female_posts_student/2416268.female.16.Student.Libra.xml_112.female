A sex in the style lunchen with Char and Stefie, followed by watching Shrek 2, and a shopping spree where no-one bought anything.....lol!! Was nice to see them to again, hadn't seen them in ages, is always nice to see them!! Yay!!! Wooooooooohoooooooooooooooooooooo!!!   Money.....or lack of it...   I need payday to hurry up please!! I want these red trainers desperately, they are  BRIGHT RED  with like a white swirly flowery pattern all over them, on problem they cost Â£50....so could payday be quick now please...!?!?!?!?!?!?!   Virus...not in the traditional sense   It is a strange old thing, I don't have the traditional symptoms, instead I have a really bad back, crappy neck, slightly swollen glands and fuzzy eyesight!?! And because it is a virus type thing, no fucking drugs work, so I keep sipping the quintessential English cup of tea!!  I shall be off, I here the kettle a boiling, wow I have drunk a lot of tea today!!!!!!!!   Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
