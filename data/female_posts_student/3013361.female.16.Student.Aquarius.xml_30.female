       
      Have you ever wanted somebody so bad that you could feel it in all of your body? No matter how much you try to think of something or someone else it never works all your thoughts return to them. You try to distract yourself with tv, or work but you find yourself daydreaming of them. You can't imagine spending your time with anybody else and you can't imagine sharing your thoughts and secrets with anyone else. Your entire heart belongs to them. They have it and the key and they're the only one. Because you're in love.
