I seriously hate internet flame wars, especially among people I don't know! it's better that one didn't start, and had those people checked back, they'd probably be as angry as I was that they took what i said so oddly. They've probably found someone else to "hate" for a day.  However, I did find the interesting blog of  urlLink David.  It's political stuff, written by David and his friend(whom i suspect to be a robot), but it's a lot more thoughtful than most any politically-focused blog out there. I recommend - these people/androids have a lot to say, but they're generally low-key and non-confrontational - just observations about our crazy system. Good reading, kiddos. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, something someone said recently sparked a thought train for me. How about the concept of "responsibility," or even "duty?"  There exist many kinds of responsibility. The first one you learn is "responsibility for your actions," which translates to children knocking over vases and then owning up to it. Obviously, everyone needs to keep this, from that child's play to the President's foreign policy.   This is a very important part of our society, especially with the capitalism. I mean, we don't do the whole "Glory for God!" thing anymore, considering that the amount of people who don't care about God, or those offended by the assumption that they DO, is gradually increasing. We still have the Puritan work ethic, though - work hard and you get rewarded. If you don't take responsibility for what you do, whether it be curing cancer (i wish) or murdering your wife, you never get what you deserve for the action.   Certainly, good deeds on the DL can be great, like anonymous donations to charity, or helping someone you don't know and never contacting them again. SO, I guess, the American child-rearing focus here is more on responsibility for BAD deeds. This is also important - guilt just isn't healthy. (Or maybe someone else gets put on death row, but it all comes back to guilt and fairness.)   And then we have the responsibility that comes with, for lack of a better word, possession. The responsibility of a parent to his children.... ... of a person to his car, or whatever toy he's got.... This is what you create yourself, because of the benefits involved. Sure, having children costs money and energy, but it's also probably the greatest kind of love a person can experience. (this comes from a non-mutter, but I assume from the attitudes of others...) It may be hard to keep up a car, but it benefits your life. But what if, for example, you child is born autistic? - or you aren't such a good driver? - It demands much more than what you expected! That kind of responsibility is the risk we take in improving our lives.  And then there's the whole "working-world" thing. The basis of it, to go economic, is that an employer has a responsibility to compensate his employees for their work without cheating them or abusing their help. Likewise, the employee is reponsible for performing the duties they promise to do, so that the employer does not waste money in overcompensating them.  This is why we have minimum wage laws, child labor laws, etc. This is why we have sales goals in retail and work codes of ethics.  Or, also, the responsibility of a government official to his constituents. He has to show that they have not elected him in vain, that he will keep his promises, that he will do his job to the very best of his ability.  Or what about the responsibility of a teacher to his students? To do the best work possible, that they may gain the best knowledge possible.  And then there's also the responsibility of using resources. Humans try to not use up all the Earth's fossil fuels, or kill off all the animals. Students work hard in school, because they feel responsible for making ht ebest use of what's available.  Or the responsibility of improving things - to not just "cut corners" and do the minimum, but to really make something better. Taking a hard class at school because the knowledge will pay off... allotting government funds for the arts....   And i think that leads into what I consider to be the most important responsibility a human being can assume - the responsibility they owe to other people. We have a responsibility to treat others WELL. To be kind to them... to avoid infringing on their rights. To sometimes give up something less important that we want, so that a greater amount of people can live free and happy.   To drive safely when there are children around.  To bake casseroles for a family who's suffered a loss.  To show your support for hard-working politicians who so rarely get the recognition they deserve.  To curb your anger at your job when speaking ceremonially to a waiter you've never seen before and will never see again.  To give what you can in a romantic relationship, and not to simply take for granted what your partner may do.  To NOT act on animal impulses - to not rape a pretty girl, to not smack someone you find annoying.  To care about the well-being of all humans, even those who will never affect your own life.  This is a responsibility we all have, and one that most everybody acts on. If we can all view each other as active holders of this responsibility, then maybe we'll treat each other as equals.  We all have the capacity to perform the basic human duty we owe each other.  Perhaps i'm a little idealistic today, but you've GOT to realize that responsibility is not ALL about actions and possessions and work - it's also about existence in a society.  And if we can just try to fulfill what society needs of us in our attitudes toward others, then maybe our society isn't as short-lived as some predict.  Maybe it IS a rising sun on that near-proverbial chair, after all.
