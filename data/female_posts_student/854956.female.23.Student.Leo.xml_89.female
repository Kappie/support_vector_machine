I have to call my advisor and schedule a meeting, and I also have to contact the people in the Fine Arts dept. to go and get the paper work rolling for my minor in music so that I can sign up for the classes I need this coming semester.  I start my first summer session on 9 June.  :-(  I have an 8am class, but I figure, it's only for 4 weeks, and I have to get some classes out of the way.  Gotta get them done.  Okay, so, school stuff is going to get done pretty quickly next week.  I also have to find a job.  I want to get a job with a child care place... but I'm kinda picky about it.  I wanna get paid at least $6, because I have experience... I also want to only work with kids 4 and up.  I don't wanna do the diaper stuff again this summer.  So, probably Monday and Tuesday of next week will be spent calling a few places inquiring about job openings.  I'll fill out applications.  I only hope I'll have the same luck I had when I got hired at Crestview.  I mean, I got called right away saying I got the job.  :-)  Anyhow....  In other news, I'm not talking to my Dad.  It's been a whole week today.  I think I deserve an apology... and I've decided that since it looks like I won't be GETTING an apology.. I may just decide to bury the hatchet... but of course, I WILL NOT say sorry to my Dad (because I didn't do anything wrong) and I will tell him that he should have apologized to me, because he jumped all over me for no reason... blowing a minor situation completely out of proportion.  Also, things are moving along with my brother's wedding and reception plans.  I think I'll be making some decorations in the not-so-far future.  I have to call him this weekend and see if he'd like me to do anything.  :-)  The wedding will be 30 Aug... and the reception will be 13 Sept.  Other news:  The rennovations are coming along quite nicely.  Thru no help by me, my Dad has finished painting in the dining room.  Have fun, Dad.  I did my fair share of painting when I painted my room... and I still have the bathroom to do.  I figure it's no big deal to paint the bathroom... I'm doing it for my Mom.  She likes to have a nice-looking house.  Anyhow, the flooring has been put in... more paneling will be going up soon (in the living room).  Then there will be more painting.  I'll be glad when it's all done (and I'm sure my Mom will,too) because then we get to decorate.  :-D  We're getting a new slipcover for the couch in the living room so it'll match... my Mom's getting new curtains... we have a  urlLink new rug  on the way in... and it looks SO COOL!  I can't believe I talked my Mom into it... it's very much a contemporary rug, and I thought she'd go for the much more boring pattern.  But she picked the one I liked....  That's all for now... more later... ; )
