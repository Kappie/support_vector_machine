What did we cover in class this morning?  The Memorandum requirement and reliance exception cases.  It was a painful 50 minutes.  Hopefully my notes will make sense after I've read those two cases.  If not, my life is over.  Ruined.    Doesn't feel like Friday.  Probably because there's so much to do.  And no, I can't just leave those cases to be read over the weekend.  They have to be read (and understood) today!!  No falling behind here, that's for damn sure.  Besides, there's already plenty to keep me busy over the three-day weekend.  Reading, briefing and researching the new paper assignment.  Yay.    But enough bitching.    Your favorite moments were lovely, commentors.  I may have to do my own list of specific moments that will live forever, but, alas, not this day.  I have something of greater importance to discuss this day.  I'm working on the track list for a new mix tentatively titled the Spring (April/May) Mix.  The list's coming along nicely, adding a few songs here and there each day.  Noticed, though, that the artists are primarily women.  Shocker.  Such is usually the problem I encounter when constructing a new CD.  So I had this idea:  maybe I could get someone to help put this thing together.  Turn it into a joint-venture type of project.  There's no mystery about who I'm thinking should join me in this adventure.  He's good at male mixes, I'm good at female mixes, we create great projects together, so why not expand our talents?    Whatdya think, honey?  Wanna make a mix together?  It could be risky, and our friendship may suffer great trauma as a result, but isn't it worth a chance?  A chance at greatness?  A chance of creating the ultimate, best Spring Mix the world has ever seen???
