So i decided to put it in here!! =)       Lately I've been feeling low A remedy is what I'm seeking I take a taste of what's below Come away to something better What I want is what I've not got But what I need is all around me I reach and search and never stop And I'll say...      If you could keep me floating just for a while 'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called... brother If you could keep me floating just for a whileI'll get back to you      Well, sometimes a Jimi Thing Slides my way and keeps me swinging I'd like to show you what's inside Yeah, but I sure don't care if you do or don't like it Brother chaos rules all about Well, sometimes I take a walk there God knows, sometimes I take a taxi Shouldn't care, I shouldn't care Bereaved as I'm feeling      The day is gone, I'm on my back Staring up at the ceiling Well, I take a drink, sit back, and relax Smoke my kind, makes me feel Better for a small time What I want is what I've not got But what I need is all around me I reach and search and never stopAnd I'll say...    Isnt that an awesomeee songg...i thought it was. Thats awesome Sammy!! haha i luv ya bro!!      *Love Alwayz*    *~Mel~*
