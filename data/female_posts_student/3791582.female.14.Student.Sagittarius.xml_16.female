I’m heading toward calmer weather, I wish you’d join my cause. Cause it’s all for the better…Well, we managed to act out another successful goodbye and you’re getting better at it every time. But I’ll be back…cause goodbyes are often better than they seem and all the good parts are in the tiny in betweens. I’ll make it back to you, I swear.   -i rewrote that maybe 3 times...i just wanted to use two of the lines and built around it.   sightseer There’s something about driving down the winding asphalt that reminds me of you. All the potholes and small bumps, then the smooth plains you’d wish would last forever. And when your drives finished and your tanks gone empty you always say “that was the best drive of my life,” some of the sights were terrible and others were flawed but the ones that kept me, kept me in awe. The saddest thing though is that there’s no way to get back to them, and the prettiest parts last for seconds. But in the end it’s all worth it. In the end you were the best trip i took this summer.  -wrote this one pretty quickly. under 10minutes i believe. i like it tho. it's...interesting.  all work copyright © smokeycustard
