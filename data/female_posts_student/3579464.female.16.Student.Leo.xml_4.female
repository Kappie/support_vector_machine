I'm ready to get down and party for real. Tomorrow, Schuyler. Friday, Shelter Island...where Kareem is making big promises for Chris' last night. Sunday, Ray and Kristy...til Thurs, when it's The Lappin. I want to fill up my days and just party til Senioritis sets in. Haha. Can I do that? Jessie wants to hang out, and so does Allyson...i wish summer was longer. What is that stupid song? Time of your life? Love you Jessie, hehe. Mwah.
