That's nice, I still have this weekend and next at the golf course, and I have to work this monday which REALLY pisses me off...but..oh..well, i'll start probably on tues at my new one.  I'm getting my hair cut and colored again today, that's nice.  I really don't have anything exciting or important to say, and nothing really to rant about other than not wanting to go to work tomorrow. I'm a boring person.
