Today I have the opportunity to listen to the infamous Richard Wagner's great-grandson, Gottfried, talk about his family.  He's a musicologist so this ought to be enlightening to everyone from fellow musicologists to historians to music aficionados to opera devotees.  Hopefully it is enlightening, anyway, and worth my trip to Toronto.    I'm off to a meeting to become registered as a person with a sensory disability at university.  This means they will give me certain accommodations when taking tests.  I don't know what else they can help with if anything but hopefully this will enlighten me.    Sounds like today might be a day of enlightenment.  That is the goal, anyhow.  More to come...
