I am frustrated with a great many things like why is it so difficult to open myself up to people, especially those who are near and dear to me?  Perhaps there is something within me which is desperately trying to either escape or come forward. Robert asked me last night if I have these horrible feelings in a manic frenzy between fits of anger and frustration, and hysterical crying and self-loathing. So I began to think and analyze what happens. I haven't considered myself happy really ever. But these are things I have kept to myself and quite hidden, so even writing this is a painful and anguishing prospect. I was talking to Michelle about this on Friday, (though my mood had started Thursday-night-ish) and I haven't really been an open person to many people. I am not saying that I am a liar by any means, but about my past and feelings, its like pulling teeth as someone has told me.   Well, after thinking about things, I have realized why. Since my childhood and especially after my father's death, I have had 2 major characteristics. 1. I am a people pleaser and 2. My feelings are mine and mine alone - mentality which I should keep everything personal to myself. Both of these have a little good in them and are meant well, but are  a little destructive. I would rather put up with a lot of pain and surpress my feelings than chance someone even taking something that I say wrong. This is most evident in my family which is the hardest to deal with.   I cannot understand how come my friends still talk to me. After reflecting I realized that I can turn around any argument in my favor and I am sure I have used it more than a few time,s even subconsciously, which makes me feel more than horrible.   For all you who read it, think about it, I am sure I have done it sometime, and I am truly sorry. I don't understand when being right was more important than knowing what's right, but I think that's why I try to please people and why it may be so hard to say goodbye. It's easier for me to make someone mad at me and have them leave me then for me to leave them.   I just think about how different things could have been if I had realized these things sooner.  But then again, "Only a life lived for others is a life worth while. " - Albert Einstein
