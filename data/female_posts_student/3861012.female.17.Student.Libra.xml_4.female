I have to go to work tonight, work isn't too bad most of the time. I am still really tired from last night though, kids REALLY tire you out. I think I will be waiting SEVERAL years before I even consider having kids.   Well these holidays are already almost half over and I wonder where they have gone. I don't seem to have even put a dent in what I wanted to get done these holidays, but I always thought that my list was a little unrealistic. The teachers are all saying to make sure we're having time off, so I guess that's what I'm doing. I think I'm going to need it before next term starts, which is the serious stuff. I can't believe trials are so close. Everyone always says that they're harder than the HSC so I want to do well just to prove to myself that I can do well in the HSC. I'm sometimes so jealous of people who just don't care about school. I want to not care sometimes but it is not in my way, or my nature...  I'll have a good day off tomorrow. A nice long weekend and then I can work most of the second week. That should give me enough time to alteast start to study for trials. I know myself that I have to put more time into study and that I have been lazy so far this year... but it's just so damn boring.  Oh well here goes trying to study, wish me luck!
