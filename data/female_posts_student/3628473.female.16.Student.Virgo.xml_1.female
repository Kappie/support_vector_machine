And it hit me. my God died for me... Yep thats right Cassy, he didn't want to be with out you any longer, so he STAYED on the cross for ya. And to tell you the truth, it pissed me off. You wouldn't think that it would but it did. I have a screen saver that says he died for me, i live for him. And what a bunch of crap that is. There are sins in my life that i feel like i can't let go off. That i know i haven't done yet, but i think about them, so that is doing... So i have done it... How in the world is that living for him? I'm choosing a sin over my God... And i haven't even done the stupid sin yet! Its kind of like your going to steal a bike. so you plan on it. Plan the times and the places and stuff. Thats sinning. In Gods eyes you basically did it! But people dont know that i'm thinking about stealing a bike... So people think that i'm doing good. And being a good person. How sad? Now let me clear up some things: I'm not planning on stealing a bike, and i am a person that wishes to follow God... And i can't use the "well i'm human, i'm not perfect" Excuse. Cause thats not it at all! I can run. I can run like the wind from this sin. I've done it before. But i decide not to. How is that wanting to follow after God? Good question. Maybe i'm just fooling myself in thinking that i acutally want to have a heart that desires my God... Kind of funny how someones mind works huh? Or someones desires over the right way... Well i have had the house to myself latly. Its clean. Nice to come home to a clean house? You know it! Now that i have nothing to do, my mind wonders. And at times i let it go out so far that i can't stop it. Which i hate the way my mind works. Sometimes i wish i wouldn't be able to think. But i do that alot. you know how you can read something, and your like what? What did i just read? That happens all the time... What a bummer. I think its a bummer cause i do it when i'm reading Gods letter... How sad... I spent a week on my one verse, and it still is mind boogling. I like it though. I keep calling Richard but no one is answering.
