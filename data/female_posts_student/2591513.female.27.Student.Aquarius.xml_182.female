It sucks that we only get to see him a month out of the year but I know he has to work to finish paying off the bills and all that fun stuff...I just wish he had a regular job.  Who knows.  One day.  I am tired.  I finally cleaned up my desk like I have been promissing to do in the past month.  I FINALLY got to it because my dad was on my ass about it.  Don't get me wrong, I just don't ahve the energy thses days.  I don't sleep all that well at night worrying about Ed leaving.  So during the day I just feel so fatigued. Maybe it would be better if I had someone to hang out with and distract me, you know?  But I don't have that.  All my friends live far away.  Oh well.  Anyway, you guys have a good week.  Thanks for those who read this from time to time and sorry if I ramble along and vent about stupid stuff.  I better get going, have to go and vacuum the downstairs since apparently I am the only one who does.
