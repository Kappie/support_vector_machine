I'm meeting up with Liz ( the Lusty Lizzard ) and Craig this afternoon for lunch downtown...that is, if they can figure out how to get to Cobo for parking.  Hmmm.  Then, I was invited to watch the Pistons game at Mike's house tonight...and meet some of his friends!  Eek!!!  I'm really excited, but I'm not always the best person in the world when it comes to meeting new people, especially a new guy's college buddies.  This should prove to be very interesting.  I realize I'll be the new girl on display, but there will also be the cats and a puppy to take the attention away from me.  Now what the hell will I wear?!?!?
