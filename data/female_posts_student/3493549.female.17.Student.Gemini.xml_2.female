Although, I felt a sense of loss as well, I guess  I got really attached to it, having spent sleepless nights and troubled days doing it. I wonder how much accumulated hours of effort I put in? A hundred?  Anyway, the past week seems to have passed by rather quickly. I got my license on Saturday, and I've been driving on and off this few days, just small errands. My parents still do not allow me to drive to college, even with them around. So I guess it will be a long time before I can drive by myself. Sobz.   I'm rather tired now, and hungry as well, so I'm off to recharge myself..
