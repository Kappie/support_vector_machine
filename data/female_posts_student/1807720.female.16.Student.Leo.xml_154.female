Drama was fun even though Sam wasn't there and she is CRUCIAL to my mark because we have not been able to rehearse our Helen Keller scene that we are doing in like forever.  Everyone seemed to like my skirt today, so it was nice cause everyone kept complimenting me.  Bio was really fun and we did a lab, and it was really interesting.  Mr. Proux I think marked me absent yesterday and he was like "ok who is your Ta?" and I was like "Radomski" and he was like "Well tell her to jump in a river because I don't make mistakes.  The only mistake I ever made was getting married, but it's ok now because I've trained her."  LOL!  By the way active living was boring - basketball - that explains it all.
