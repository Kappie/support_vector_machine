Just your very existence ... makes me want to be with you, And I see off in the distance ... A sky of Rose colored Blue.  As the new day begins .... and the sun rises ever so slow. God changes the dark blue sky .... Into a Rose colored rainbow.  And as my mind wanders a bit .. I begin to think of what makes me happy, My mind is filled with thoughts of you ... As I gaze at a sky ... full of Rose colored Blue.  And as I dream of our time together ... Trying to figure out what we will do. If and when the day comes upon us ... When we finally say ... "I love you" ...  You hold my heart so softly ... And I cherish the thoughts of you. Thoughts that are so evident ... Caused ... by a sky of "Rose colored Blue"
