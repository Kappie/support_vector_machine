Deal with my dorkness for now.) and taking pictures of the city. These are very, very, very random pictures and without context, it would be sort of hard to follow. ANYHOW! On ho!!! (No, I did not call you a "ho" ... I'm sorry you misunderstood.)      ^ Our first stop was the Coit Tower where it takes hours for a parking lot and only minutes to realize there really isn't much to see. The adventure we had involved the payable bathroom where you only have 3-12 minutes to do your "thing" before the portal-like door opens, leaving you exposed to the entire world. I had such a kick by watching a guy enter the bathroom, not knowing where to relieve himself. I was laughing so hard.       ^ This was the bustling part of Chinatown ... Not really. My sister had the audacity to grab hold of my arms and push me through the crowd, like I was her personal human shield. I nearly mowed down old people in the process.       ^ Also taken in Chinatown. We saw a guy playing the Chinese violin and I do believe he's giving me a dirty look. Can't you tell? Notice the interesting view of Yuri's back.       ^ I call this picture "Mr. Penguin Pants." While I was walking down the street a guy, wearing extremely low pants, walked right in front of me. And he walked very,  very  slowly. I believe he was genetically engineered to dress poorly thus causing him to walk like a penguin in his large pants. I couldn't resist taking a picture of his bum. I only wish I aimed the camera better.        ^ Our next stop was the Yerba-Beuna-Vista-Whatever-Building. I'm not sure what it's called, but it's a mall-like complex with five levels. It has restaurants, movie theaters, and many stores. They had a level where they had several arcade games. One of which was the DDR (Dance, Dance Revolution) Game Machine. A Japanese boy owned on it, getting about a 90 score. However, it probably proved he didn't have a girlfriend either.      ^ Walking back towards our Mode of Transportation, I saw this lady in the yellow dress who might've possibly been a hooker. I thought that was cool so I snapped a picture of her.       ^ We ate lunch about four o'clock and picked up some Japanese food. We headed over to the Golden Gate Park where the temperature turned frigid all of a sudden. We were freezing as we ate, but we glowed with warmth, laughter, and camraderie as we tortured the sea gulls. This was our fabulous view as we ate. I do not know the man in the picture.       ^ Last stop: The Golden Gate Bridge. I found this ... " Someday I'll be back here and I'll be in love ." Awwww.     Right now I'm focused on getting a digital camera so it'll be easier to post up pictures nobody really cares to see, preferably before I go to Lake Tahoe in October. I took all of these with very expensive cheapie disposable cameras and scanned them so ya'll can see my summer wasn't a complete bummer.   Okiepokie, phantom readers. I'm off to bed now.
