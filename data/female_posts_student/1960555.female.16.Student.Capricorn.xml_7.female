Joel in the background "You're an Idiot, You're a jackass, lalalalala, You talk to much"  It's quite possibly the funniest tribute I've ever heard.  For all y'all with the blank expressions, just ask Afra, she knows all about it.   -In other news-  I have it under good authority that our boys from Simple Plan will be in Vancouver this November.  First off AHHHHH OMG!!  IT"S ABOUT TIME!!! BAND-AIDS UNITE!!  And secondly,  Emmy, your leaving Walla Walla for the day and partying Canada Style.  Hard COre, all the way, and yea, Af, Kylie, lets recreate Warped shall we?  We'll have a hoot and a half stalking David and Seb and Pierre.  Their playing with GOB again, so you know it's a good show.  Can't wait.  Off to continue with my 6 hours of homework.  Late,
