I love the child, but she really is liable to do that.  I brought my laptop with me (cause although they have a computer with internet, it sucks).  Once I got here, i noticed that someone in the houses adjacent has a wireless connection and I can pick up on their signal.  Depending on where i am.  so i ran around the house trying desperatly to get the signal.  But the only time I got it, it was actually too weak for me to do anything.  Sucks eh?  Well, probably not since I"m not actually suspose to be stealing signal...  I've just watched the opening cerimonies of the Olympics.  Very interesting since the order of the countries depends on the host countries own alphabet.  And Canada, being something like K - triangle - N - triangle - D - triangle...or something like that.  So we ended up marching after the States this year.  Not that i really care, but I thought it was an interested dynamic.  So I was up at the summer home last night with my friend.  It was relaxing and actually a pretty good time full of drinking vodka with my parents.  Who knew three or four years ago that I would be sitting around a fire, drinking and having a good time with my parents.  But true story.  Times theyt are a changing..
