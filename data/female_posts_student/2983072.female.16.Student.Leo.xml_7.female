We spent the whole freaking Saturday  going around town, then when the time finally came to rent the best movie of all time which I've been dying to see for the past six months IT'S NOT THERE! Then I ask how is it possible for Neo in all his sexy glory to not be available for me to faun over? How in the world can the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy *sparkle sparkle* not have a sign that says "guaranteed in stock or it's free?!  BLEH! So in a bad mood were going down US 19 when suddenly my mom scares the bejezzis out of me when she yells "look yonder! A video store!" ok so technically those weren't her exact words but it was something along those lines. She makes freak U-turn one of those that defies gravity and the laws of motion and the Hollywood video came in to my line of vision.  I swear I could hear the chorus in the back ground singing HALLELUJAH! There in lied my salvation! Long story short I found "the one" my beloved...And he had a nice trip home to my DVD player pressed to my bosom the whole freakin' way, with the sound of my annoying high-pitched rabid fan girl squealing busting the ear drums of my poor mother.   So I just finished watching the ending to the best trilogy and I'm sitting here and I have absolutely no idea what the heck happened in the story. I was good up to the point in which neo some how became the oracle. Oops well I shouldn't give the story away the little bit I under stood of it, though I'll bet if I watched it again I'd understand it better considering I wouldn't have a 6 year old complaining sbout how my her butt hurts because she's sitting on the floor. Grrrrrr. I'll have to do that later.  Another thing, I just had one of my long time wishes fulfilled. No I do not have infinite amounts of chocolate coming out of my closet and no I have not saved the digital world...yet. But I did got the next best thing. Calvin Klein Boxers! Oh yeah because boys clothing is always ten times  more comfy than girls clothes, which is always either to short or to tight. Those boxers are my new best friends, word to the wise girls there is no shame in buying boxers for yourselves, you should only begin to panic when you see a guy buying bras and panties particularly the pink kind.  Ick, you know to this day I loath the color pink. I can't stand it, something about it's sickly hue gets me every time. I'm not talking about the hot and spicy pink. Oh no I'm talking about the light girlie abomination to the color red. I began pondering over this and I came to a very important discovery. My hate for pink stems from my hatred of the pink power ranger. Sad yes, but in good reason. GOD. Kimberly ruined that show she needed to burn and die with that annoying little laugh of hers. She also needed to stop hitting on Tommy cause you know she needed to come to the realization that he's just to good for her.  Yes I'm a freak. Yes I have issues with the telescreen.  Now leave me alone before I send big brother out to get you.
