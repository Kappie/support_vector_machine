Like, you think that someone is getting murdered everyday, but you don't hear about it, you might even ignore it like me because, hey, people die, and others will be assholes and kill them...unless it's something overly shocking, like Tabitha Tuders or something.  But...I was looking through that list of recently-published BLogs today, I sampled the EMO kid non-professional ones, that have the ".blogspot.com" after their names. I read about a girl who's car was almost stolen and she was freaking out, I read about an overweight college guy with depression he probably doesn't know about yet, I read a lot of hate and brokenness. As much as we all are divided, I suppose we really are all the same.  And that is the extent of my insightfulness for the morning. And now some good ol' fashioned DEATH psychology, w00t! Gustav beckons.  Farewell friends.
