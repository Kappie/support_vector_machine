He plays god with the people,he created his own kingdom. Captain Willard had a lot a chances to kill kurts but he waitedso he can get to knowhim better. when he had the talk with kurts, kurtstold him not in a direct way but he made willard think it was ok to kill him, that he wanted to bekilled so he can get away from the pain. so he wasn't just finishing his job he was helping Kurtz.
