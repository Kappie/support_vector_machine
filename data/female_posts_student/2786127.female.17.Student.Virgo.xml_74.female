I want to go on the trip...don't get me wrong, its just in some ways i just want to chill around here and hang out with Genie.  I'll miss her, we've been crazy joined at the hip lately. It'll be like missing a leg, or something.   Anyways, more later i need to go get ready for church. blahh. and make a packing list, because i don't know what to pack.   oh yeah, and why didn't anyone tell me i needed a calculator at the ACT's? RARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!
