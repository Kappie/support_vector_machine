The Crow's got back from Colorado.. so me and Emily hung out with Ryan and Jenny. We messed around on the scootchers.. FUN! It was so freaking hot, so we just jumped in the pool with our clothes on. Only for like 5 minutes tho. Now Emily is in the shower and I am trying to waste some time. I heard that Robbey's birthday was today.. SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROBBEY! Ad Paxton's is comming up.. Still too many birthdays.. I miss everyone.
