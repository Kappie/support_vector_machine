Yes they are VERY beautiful and make our legs look long and sexy, but our poor, poor feet are screaming!! It's one of the worlds mysteries! But anyway, I had such a blast, getting all dolled up and going out on the town!! Thanks Jane and again HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! You too Jason! But next time lets wear comfortable shoes or get there earlier so we can sit!! Whenever she developes the pics I'll try to put one on here! (but we forgot to get one of the shoes!!!) oh well, next time!  By the way, I still haven't done my Theology paper!! It's due Wednesday!!! yea! Feel the rush! (wait thats just the allergy medicine...) :)
