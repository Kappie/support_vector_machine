Sorry, I haven't been updating myself by checking the blog.   But this is why only 4 pple were initially called to attend the meeting: At our last meeting at school with the teachers when we discussed about the next meeting, the teachers wanted it to be a small meeting because they just wanted to take a look at the video and the overview of the games. So only the key members were required to be there. Myself, Fuzz and Julius were in-charge of the video, exhibition and screening of projects (as discussed at the first meeting), and Nick was in charge of the games. So naturally Nick was supposed to know everything about the games and stuff. But when he called me this morning, and said he didn't, that's when I said ok, call Simren too.   Sorry about the mess up.   As for manpower, thanks Hal and Yatt. Myself and Fuzz have started calling people up. Hopefully we have enough people.   See all of you at 1.30 at LT 50 on Tuesday. Someone pls inform Lianne and whoever else who doesn't know. Thanks.
