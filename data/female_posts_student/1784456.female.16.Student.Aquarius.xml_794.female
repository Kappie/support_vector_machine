Oooh, Izzy's on holiday well actually she's back today but she says she'll be really wacked *how do you spell whacked? wacked? aaargh!* (How do you spell? Good question.) Laura's reading Fushigi Yuugi like the good girl she is. :D Hehe, I'm getting her to read it! (Well you said you were bored Laura!) Hehe, I'm just too nice! Yeay! Stone Henge! How... random! Hmm... aargh! I have to go research it. (I'm not the only one in my family who's mad!) Bisi!
