I'm alone again..as usual.. but if Terence is here, I won't be goin to church by myself..   Juz had my vindaloo curry chicken dinner at 9.30pm so late ya... intended to cook before church but I was cleaning my kitchenette so ran outta time.. it's so darn cold now..wonder how warm the camp site will be..and if they have a phone for me to call Terence... or best if they have reception..so I can use my mobile... if all else fails then I'll hav to go without talking to my baby for 3days in a roll.. oh manz.. I don't wanna think abt tt...  Now is the sale peroid..I've gotten myself 2 pairs of earrings and 1 FCUK Tee for Terence.. hope he likes it cos it's in grey.. met up wof Padma yesterday, the chio babe is still as sexy as ever whaoooo... Really thank God for placing people in my life at appropriate times... if not I'll be a hermit at home.. such is life...   I don't think I'm making much sense here..but well, for the past few days, my QT with Mister God has directed me to obedience and oppression.. I don't really know why oppression but somehow He'll reveal to me someday... I'm waitin to be enlighten.. waiting...
