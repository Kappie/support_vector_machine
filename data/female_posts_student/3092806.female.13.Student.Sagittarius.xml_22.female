I picked up a book , Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul , and opened it up. I had already read this book once before about a year or two ago, so Imiscellaneously picked a section to read.The one that I happened toflip opento was on the painfulsubject ofdeath/dying.   No one, except my dog, has died yet in my family. You could say that I am very fortunate. I've never had to deal with theissue of death.I've never been towake or funeraleither. My family would almost be entirely complete except for my nanny, my mom's mom.My nanny died before my parents were even married. She never knew about us kids. It sort of sucks but I know that compared to other people's lives that I've lost nearly nothing compared to the people they've lost. Since I've never had to face the terrible grip of death, I wonder about where you go after you die and why we're here on Earth.    I don't believe in God, though in my religion I am supposed to. It sounds terrible, doesn't it? Yet, I don't. I don'tbelieve in any other religions except one, and that is MY own religion. You see, no one actually knows how things were created on this planet. No one can know for sure. There are lots and lots of different religions out there to believe in. Which one is true? Many people probably ask the same question. Yet who cares? Personally, I believe that you should believe in whatever you want to believe in. We're only on Earth for a short time, so why not? In my religion, the one that I made up, after people die they go to a place that they've always wanted to see, their favorite place in the whole wide world, etc... Once they're there they can review the happiest memories of their lives... They can do whatever they want. It's my version of  heaven . It probably soundsincredibly stupid to you, but that's your opinion. After I die, I'm want togo tomy Camp. There will be shooting stars, brilliant thunderstorms, warm bonfires, magic, etc... There will be all of the things that I've always adored... It'll be wonderful.    Why do people followa religion? You've probably asked this before too. My answer, though it will most likely be very different then yours, is that people believe in religions because it's a nice thought that after you die you go somewhere. They also usually always tell you how everything was created which allows the mind to focus on other things besides how everything was made and who created it all.Don't get me wrong, religions are great. I don't like it when people of one religion callpeople of anotherreligion false, though. You never know, maybe both religions are completely wrong.     Since I have to go, I'll leave you with the one message I've been trying to get through to you, believe in what you want to believe because we're only on Earth for a short time and no one knows the truth about how everything was created in this world.    And I'm gone.
