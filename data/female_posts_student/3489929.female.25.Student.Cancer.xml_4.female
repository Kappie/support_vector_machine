I remember when we were kids, and Nick was so small for his age, that the day he started sixth grade and rode the middle-school bus for the first time, the bus driver told him to get off and wait for the elementary school bus, and I had to tell her that he was older than he looked.  Now he's taller than me and has the beginnings of a beer gut, according to my youngest brother John, who sees him more than I do.  You have to understand- Nick's a hermit. I haven't seen him since Christmas, even though I go to my parent's house at least once a month, if not more. He's either never there, or holed up in his bedroom drawing something (my baby brother is a kick-ass anime artist).   I hope he buys some beer and brings it home to piss my dad off. Ha!  Moving on...  What a day (be warned- loooong work rant ahead).  Cracky came back to work and seems to have learned the Workplace Golden Rule: Thou shalt not deign to address the folks your absence screwed over. She kept to her druggie self all day long and I was thankful for it. The one time she addressed me, I snapped at her, and then she left me alone. Hmph.  Blondie has to have major surgery next week and thus will be out for a good six weeks. A bad six weeks, on my part... I lose my bitch partner!!! I feel bad for her, and selfishly, I feel bad for myself that I'll have to deal without her.  The saddest thing is, she's scheduled to come back   after   I leave for Mississippi. So more than likely, this is our last week working together. :(  Should I feel bad for encouraging her  not  to come back at all? I know the place makes her miserable, and after two-and-a-half years working there, Jefe still doesn't seem to like her very much, and she tends to annoy the shit out of Posh. I love her to death personally, but I am also not biased enough to realize that she is not as good as myself and Barbie (unfortunately) and has not really progressed throughout her tenure at the company. She stays steady- but on a lower plane than the rest of us, whereas I have a few lows and then many months of highs. Jefe just doesn't seem to have taken a liking to her as he has to myself and Barbie and Posh. I can't quite put my finger on why.  Speaking of liking... according to Posh, he was surfing the web and found something he really liked for me, so he ordered it and she gave it to me today. It's a set of Hello Kitty dominoes. I freaking love it. :)   See, the thing is, only Posh and I get this kind of stuff. Jefe always finds little butterfly things for her and Hello Kitty stuff for me, but he has never had the inclination to search out stuff that Blondie might like, or Barbie or Cracky for that matter. Like I said, it kinda stumps me, mainly because I can't figure out why he likes me so damn much. I make his life hell a vast majority of the time! While I don't understand it, I do appreciate the hell out of it. It's nice to be thought of. :)   I think I am going to take advantage of the fact that Jefe seems to be in a good mood and ask him if I can go ahead and take a loan out on the vacation pay I will receive in the middle of July. I really, really must get my car fixed. It's getting to the point where I am scared to drive it because it shakes and rattles so bad. I mean, it's getting me where I need to go, but it's taking me forever because I have to stay off the interstate, and preferably all major highways as well. The day it breaks down, I may break down as well.  And I don't want to get rid of the car, because 1) I cannot afford a car payment right now (or probably  ever ), and 2) I really do like the Mustang, especially when it's RUNNING.  Time to go watch some  Jeopardy.  Since I haven't had occasion to really use my brain in, oh, five years, I like to give it some exercise every now and then. Besides, that guy who keeps winning on there who's been on almost twenty times now and won more than half a million dollars kicks ass- and I can't wait to see his eventual downfall.   I hope it's a woman that beats him.
