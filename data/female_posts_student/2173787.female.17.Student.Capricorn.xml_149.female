Now I realize I have 5 weeks until YLA and have all ready cancelled work and told my mom to get her vacation day back because we couldn't go college looking.  Also, it makes spring break really tight with YLA Friday through Sunday, Passover starting Monday, and my parent free college road trip the rest of the week.  Ack...Need a new brain!
