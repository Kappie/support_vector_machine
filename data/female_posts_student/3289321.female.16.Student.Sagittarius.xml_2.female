But usually, you figure out why He had you go through a certain situation, or meet a specific person, or move to a particular city.  Sometimes I think about that..I wonder why I ended up in hickory.  Or why I ended up going to Foard.  Why I had to leave charlotte.  Why my group of friends has changed so much in the past year, or even six months.  Some of these things I've sorta figured out..and others, i have yet to discover.  Alright, enough of that thinking stuff.  Today was awesome.  I went to the Y, had a really good workout, saw some people from school..went to the library...went home to shower...went to go see Shrek 2 with Audrey, Megan, and Alex - and it was SO FUNNY!  It was equally as good as the first Shrek.  Wow.  I laughed so freggin hard.  Then after the movie, we all had yet another good laugh when megan about peed her pants b/c of something we won't discuss in here, haha.  HAHA meg, "those 8th graders, tisk tisk.." - you KNOW they were checking us out, mmhmm.  RIGHT, lol.  No one checks me out, remember?  Haha.  Good times, good times.  And SOOO many more to come.....lol..Folly Beach, SC and Pineville, KY, LOOK OUT AND TAKE COVER!!  they will never be the same.  Wow, you can tell that it's really late, haha.  I think I'll get off here and go do some reading.
