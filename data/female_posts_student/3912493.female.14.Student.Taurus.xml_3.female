Ugh, band... the last thing I wanted to hear about. She told me that next week we're gonna get started. I'm gonna be there every day for two weeks. The first week (this is what I understood) I'm gonna be there for around 10 hours a day: morning, afternoon and night. We'll finish at like 9 PM. These people are insane. They must be really traumatized with band and music. Then the second week we're only gonna go morning and night... or something like that. Ms. Callaway doesn't know where we're gonna do this camp stuff. Supposedly we were gonna do this in the high school, but since it's just a mess because of all the construction going on, then she has no idea. She told me that last year the section leader called you and told you info about the band crap, so I hope they do that this year.   The only good thing I can think about that's gonna be worthwhile about this band camp crap is that I get to see Mikey and all of my friends. I haven't seen Michael-kun or any of my friends for a loooooong time... Except Michelle. I see that girl every Tuesday, and her maturity level is still really low. Ha-ha, silly girl. XD So practically, after this week, my summer's over. Bummer. I better get going with reading WtLD.   My mom also told me that she saw Yaqui-chan as she was going inside to her lessons. My mom said that she had her hair straight or something like that. Whoa, that's something I gotta see! =P Oh, and also... Brook Mays is moving to Cedar Hill.I don't know why but they just are. Ms. Callaway told me they were moving because it was a dump in that place. She said once she found a roach and she could hear crickets and stuff. Bleh.   And to close off, Kosovar's returning back to the US on August 11 and hopefully be able to fix the ZP Boards and not have to go to those temporary forums anymore. He also said that he's working on a new skin for the ZP main site, and that's good since the one they have right now isn't very high quality... and it isn't the best skin ever. So w00t for Koso and his returning-ness! Of course, anyone who's not familiar with ZP has no idea what I'm talking about, so boo-yah all of you Non-ZPers! The OoT Community, which includes Goddess Din, Mike, Kaden, Groucho, and I,is making an 3V1L PL0T to take over the General Chat once the old boards come back. Ah, yes. Our head leader is Goddess Din, but if we fail, then we'll blame it on Mike AKA Link2004. =D Behold! PH34R T3H OoT Community!
