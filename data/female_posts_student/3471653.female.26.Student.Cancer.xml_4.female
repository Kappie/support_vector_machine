Unlike other authors, she puts a fair number of Christians in her novels, and also unlike other authors she doesn't make them into caricatures either of sanctity or of hypocrisy.  They are real people, and like real Christians they sometimes are true to their calling, and sometimes fall very hard.  The best example of this is in her  Death in Holy Orders .    Her most famous mysteries are in the  urlLink Adam Dalgliesh series , which includes both of the novels I mentioned.  Highly recommended.
