Nope...just a pointless post. I've had a few inspirations to write poems today, but I'm having trouble getting them to flow right. I want to go shopping. Sadly enough, the mall is closed by now. Oh, and I just remembered I have to work tomorrow! This sucks! I need a change of scene...everything is so monotonous. But I think school will, unfortunately, change that. I was hoping for another change of scene...like a Cali beach or something....ahh...sounds nice...
