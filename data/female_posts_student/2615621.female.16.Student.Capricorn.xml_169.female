My new fave store is HOT TOPIC i love that store!! i went in there to look at some more shoes. there was this HOT guy workin in there as usual, so i got him to help me. he was my shoe slave. muahahaha. he was soo cute, his name was matt. he was quiet and kinda shy which sucked. but we did laugh and talk a little bit. i tried on 3 diff pairs of shoes and couldnt decided between 2 of them cuz the one i REALLY wanted was too big. He had a little brace on his arm so i asked him how he hurt his arm and he totaled his car haha wow..smart move. i then told him i felt bad cuz i had him lacing all these shoes up with his hurt arm hahaha he smiled and said it was no prob that he didnt mind cuz we were having prob the best conversation hes had at work. awwwwwwwww shucks. lol he was a cutie. X-TREMLY bangable might i add. i finally decided on black and pink converse high tops and i started rollin the top down and he was like..oo i do that too! lol so we sat around talkin about shoes. lol he told me i was "rockin'" the black and pink high tops vs the black and white chuck taylors. ..so of course..i got his fave. lol He had black hair, it was straight, like he could have done the hot flippy outtie thing, but he doesnt, so its straight..still hot. and u know..dressed like a skater dude. omg so hot! haha gotta love em. I did really like his silver thumb and pinkie rings. anyways...i should go in there more often and make him get me shoes and stuff outta the locked cabnets just so i can talk to him and ask him his opinion. haha   I went to American Eagle and got 2 shirts on sale, $15 for both of em. Now that i think about it..i forgot what they even look like..oh wait, one has a map on it and the other is green and its about "memories made here" at some hotel or resort..whatever, they were cheap and from AE, one of my fave stores. u cant go wrong in there. I did want a pair of pink carpis with fraded edges and stuff, they were like $20 but unless i was a size 0 or 4 i couldnt get em. lol fuck that.  I think went to DQ and got a hawiann blizzard. yummmm, def. worth driving the 15mins to dobson for when i get back home. :p   Everythings been great..yup...  *much love and power rangers*
