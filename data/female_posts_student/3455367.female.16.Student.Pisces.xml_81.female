I so vote we do one of those Simona cooks for everyone nights again!! except no crap cooking chocolate!!! it would be soooo good with like nice chocolate....Jeremy's cheap skate icecream was okay I spose ;)   God it's nearly back to school......and I am starting to do all my assignments......boring.....  Kas is so annoying she is like the biggest fashion victim ever at the moment.....Jeremy picked us up from the airport the other night and we went to Cavill for food and she like has to get a skirt and lip crap and perfume on before she gets out.....*rolls eyes* god..... she's so in love with herself.....anyway she's nagging to get on the internet AGAIN like this is the first time in how long ive actually been on....so i better consider getting off.  Dad got an ibook and creature speakers they're sooooo good....and we are getting broadband soon...yaya....oh and apparently we have an office space above the Mullum flower shop (near Santos).  Ugly G-nome is still in my room....i dont think i can part with it *tear* .....Maya (if you're still alive haven't talked to you in ages) what are we gonna do with it??
