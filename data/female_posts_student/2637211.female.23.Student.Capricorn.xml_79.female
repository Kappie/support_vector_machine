Way to research. And I'm not referring to Jerm who discovered this small, but costly issue. So Valentine's Day for Jerm and Liz will include a long motorcycle ride, followed by take-out sushi and a bottle of saki. This will hopefully ensue in good loving and not a migraine, which happened to me once when I had too much saki. We're looking forward to a quieter and cheaper romantic weekend. I admit that I'm sad about the Disneyland mix-up, and only slightly bitter at Shane and Ursula. I know they feel bad, and they're being really nice to get us these super-discount tickets, but I've grown increasingly grumpy with them. It all started with the oatmeal incident. If you're not going to eat something that someone makes for you, tell them when they ask you that you don't like breakfast food. That's all I ask. I hate wasting food so needlessly, and I ended up using all of my organic oatmeal, which I really like, to make a pot of oatmeal that no one but me and Jerm ate. Shane managed a few polite bites, but I seriously wouldn't have made so much if I'd known they didn't like it. I like them and think they're good people, but they can be demanding and picky, two things I try hard in life not to be. Anyway, enough of my rant. It all makes be feel apathetic about life in general, especially school. Oh, and I missed dollar pint night because of my apathy. I'm in the blahs.
