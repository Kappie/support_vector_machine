Too much to ask though. How is everyone ELSE's summer? Who has trips planned really soon? Comment and tell me about them. I think Jenny get's back on saturday from Sky Ranch! I hope she had a lot of fun =)  My birthday was yesterday! It was really a great day. I forgot about the whole being treated special on birthdays. It felt so good. I didn't do too much, but it was so cool to realize that alot of people DO love me and DO care about me. I forgot about that.   Yesterday morning, I woke up and opened one of my presents. It was a $50 gift certificate to DSW! Woohoo. I also opened my card that my parents got for me. On it, it says, "You're such a terrific teenager! So, for your birthday, we thought we'd hang out with you at the mall." Then inside it says, "Just kidding! Relax" haha. I thought that was funny.  I went to work and my first class sang me happy birthday after class time was up. Right before break was over my first class and basically all of the classes of that day sang me happy birthday! I got so embarrassed. You know how red I can become! Haha. My second class bought me cookies. Mmmmmm.. they were really tasty! I was so surprised!! Before I left to go home, Sarah Slaughter brought me into Valerie's office and gave me cupcakes and cookies! I was so happy! I had no idea they had planned this! They were so sweet. I wanted to cry!! Hehe.  Sarah picked me up at Casa. She opened the glove box and inside was a present that had Happy Birthday wrapping paper! I didn't think she was going to get anything! I really didn't expect any of this stuff. Inside were hemp bracelets that she made me!! I just about cried. I know how long those took her. They are so incredible. One of them has beads on it that say "Just Spin", one of my mottos because, first of all, I tend to spin alot for some reason. Two because it keeps me going and you should always continue to spin and live your life to the fullest extent. Another one of the bracelets had rainbow beads on it! It is soooo awesome.  Sarah, I love you.  Thank you.  We headed to Red Sand Archery to look at archery sets for Sarah. She really wants to get into that. They didn't really have anything she wanted because pretty much all of it was for hunting, and she's not looking to kill. Also, the "beginner" sets were Compound bows and she didn't need that. She wants a recurve bow or something like that. I'm not as informed about bows as she is, so I really have no idea what I'm talking about. Haha. Well because we couldn't find anything at Red Sand Archery, we went to Oshman's and they didn't have anything either. They had about 8 bows. What a great selection, Oshman's. Sheesh!   We went to my house after Red Sand Archery and Oshman's. We babysitted for a while and watched some TV. We watched A Knight's Tale and part of Pirates of the Caribbean. My grandma came over to cook my birthday dinner! Isn't that cool?! I opened my present from her. The bow for the present were 16 sugar cubes for "Sweet Sixteen" Cool huh?! That's what I thought! hehe. She gave me another $50 gift certificate to DSW and some euros for Europe in July. I thought that was a really cool gift. She doesn't usually spend that much on me! I was really surprised.   The dinner was sooo good! I was so happy that Sarah was with me. I can't believe she can actually love someone like me. =) Thank you Sarah for loving me! I opened my other presents.. I got a gift certificate created by parents that i can have any new computer system that I want! Cool? yes. I also got the game "Scene It". We played it after dinner. Sarah and I won! woohoo! We blew out my candles and at the cake that my mom made for me. My favorite cake, Lemonade cake. very cool. Thank you  Sarah and I played Mini-Games on Pokemon Stadium 2 with my brother for a little while and then had a great idea of going to Starbucks to get some coffee. Well about a mile out of my neighborhood, her check engine light turned on. Oh no! We pulled over and waited about 2 hours for the tow truck to get there! Such a great day to end my birthday, hehe. It was fun to wait with her. We listened to ABBA and danced in the street. Very fun! I hope her car is okay.   Well that's all for now. Work was great today! It went really fast. I got to talk to Andy Baldwin for awhile.  He's pretty cool. Someone to talk to at least! hehe. Umm.. what else? Sarah's almost here and we're going to go to DSW and then go watch a movie at her house. That's all. Have a great night tonight you guys!   Bye and *kisses* to sarah!!
