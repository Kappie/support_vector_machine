I didn't wake up at exactly the time I should be walking out the door, and then spend the next 10 minutes running frantically around my apartment, muttering "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"  But instead of getting ready at a normal pace that would allow me to leave on schedule for the first time in THREE WEEKS, I turned on my computer, checked my email, and then proceeded to lie in bed for 10 minutes thinking of every possible excuse that would allow me to not go to work.  The day before, I called in and said that I was getting my car fixed. The most plausible excuse I could think of this morning was that my cat was sick (he does have the sniffles) and needed to take him to the vet.  Feeling that this wasn't adequate, I even did a quick Google search for excuses to not go to work. I GOOGLED for excuses not to go to work! Alas, the search was fruitless, and I ended up just sucking it up and going to work.
