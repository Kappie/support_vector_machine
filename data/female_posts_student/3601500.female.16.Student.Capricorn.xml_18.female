Thank you! *hugs*'' And she hung it on her wall. ^^;; She's very generous to have given me money for my horseback riding lessons, so it's the least I could do to thank her... I went there, we talked, I stayed over for dinner, talked some more, she made calls to buy a farm house (with stables!), but it was sold, talked some more, said I looked tired (I was), went home.   Then read. ^^ I started a drawing for my sister's fanfic, Gold Envy turned into Roy... since I love those two, I just had to draw it. >.> Evil, evil Envy who killed Hughes!  ;-; *sigh* She writes very well, sometimes I wonder if she realizes how much I love her work. And her. I miss her so much...  Death in fiction, death in life. My best friend's friend is in a coma - he was hit by a car while on his moto. I hope he lives - my bf already suffered the death of many... In my family, the only people I was close to who died was my grandpa (1998) and great aunt (2000). I've never had friends die, but she has... she hadn't ever met her grandparents either. Anyway, my best friend wasn't able to concentrate, all that talk about deadly accidents and motos and... :/  That's right, I have homework for my driving class... there was a bit of Physics today. I realized I remember stuff (usually, I forget. like math, ugh), and really enjoy the theory... I wonder if I'll regret not taking Physics next year, but I won't go in sciences at University so I guess not (and I'll get a better grade in psychology for sure. I also don't want to have my three sciences at the same time again!).  ...Little sister still crying. Oh, and my cousin went over to Ottawa to retrieve one of the kittens that were taken there without his permission. It cost his parents 175$, but it's his birthday present. Stupid person who brought the kitten there - my little sister is still heartbroken, the kitty cost my cousin lots, and they put down the black one because it had an infection. *sighs* I don't feel like writing anymore, I'm a bit depressed (among other things, my horseback riding lesson didn't go that well, I wonder if I should still take some...)
