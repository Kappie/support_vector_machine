I met an old friend in town who came with me to get my ear done in Argyll Market with two girls from the GoMa. I needed the support (no matter how much I claim to not be a coward)- three sets of hands gripping me firmly into the chair. Anyway, Scott, the half Russian, half- German and slightly Scottish, was more than happy to see me. And you should have seen his hairdo! He looked as sweet as a button with his blonde highlights but as with all gay men he wouldn't stop fiddling with it and shortly after went into a small rant over his ex-work mates.  Well, the rest of the day wasn't so wonderful. Thanks to Robyn. I don't know why she hates all her ex's so much? I mean, Liam didn't dump her and she had no reason for getting rid of him. Maybe boredom set in or something. Who knows, I mean this is Robyn we're talking about! To me Liam is just another guy, no wait he isn't. He's a great guy. Everyone likes him, that is of course, except Robyn and here I arrive to the main point. I spotted Liam standing amongst Steph and a few others at the steps amongst Borders. I remember how I used to like him- he's really a sweet guy- so I stepped up to say hi. He was very nice about it but Robyn got annoyed. No matter how much time I tried to balance out with her it just wasn't enough. Next minute I have Miriam chasing me up and dragging me around the corner like a ragdoll to tell me that Robyn "Just can't take it, AJ and Liam are sitting around there- too many Ex's at once"...and so on and so on. How childish. She was eventually convinced to come back round and sit- with several cigarettes dumped in her lap she was content for a few minutes. Soon the face pulling started but I sat with Liam and had a good gab. Much to her fury. She stormed off in a huff- several times in fact- but I merely sat and ignored her.   Later, after the huge strop she did it again! I merely suggested we get the bus to the QMU but she went silent and stared at the floor like a five year old. Then mumbled that I was ruining her special day and that she knows how to get there from the Underground at Hillhead. Well, hello?! My old school is up that way besides the fact that I'm never away from the West End! So after much huffing and puffing on the subway Mickey, Robyn and I found ourselves outside the QMU in a huge que of odd looking people ready to rock the night away. Robyn was so huffy she refused to say more than two words to me and had her back to me most of the time. By this point I was ready to tell her where to stick her ticket and walk away. Either that or wipe the floor with her! When we got inside (after Mickey purchased her own ticket) we took our seats. Immediantly Robyn ran up to the front and looked about, then wondered up to the bar for some water with Mickey- neither of whom offered me anything. Sometime later the first support band came on, I don't remember the name, and Robyn and Mickey we're off and about: toilet, dance floor, bar, toilet etc etc...and so I was on my own- babysitting bags. Furious but keeping my temper for the time being. By the next band "Walls of Jericho" I was feeling a little bit better so naturally I tried to lighten the mood. She got more angry- trying to explain how selfish she was being but at the same time trying to sound nice about it. I'm beginning to think she has nothing between her ears at all. Anyone else would have taken then hint but nooooo! Not Robyn. Bravo Robyn. By now (as you can imagine) steam was streaming out of my ears and I was ready for walking out. But then wee KD Rielly showed up! I had a wee gab with her while My Ruin was on- but I kept getting interupted by the sound of someone hocking back a fresh shot of Mucus and firing it all over the stage- yes, It was the lead singer Tairrie of My Ruin. KD and I just looked at each other before yelling "Stop spitting..." a few rude words followed but I shall not mention them at the minute! When I'd finally had enough I went to find Robyn in the crowd of devoted fans screaming their loyality to Rocks biggest Mucus cannon. She followed, reluctantly. Then I told her I was about to leave. Then realising what she'd driven me to she tried to beckon me to stay by saying she would carry her bags around with her. Too Late- I was off...  And since then I've had no contact from Robyn to apologise for her behavour or to ask if I got home alright. So much for best friend.
