We (me Abi and Chaz) all thought it would be hilarious to order a large cheese feast stuffed crust with extra cheese... well it was quite funny until we started to get about half way into eatin it when it didnt really taste as good as we may have thought. This was the point in which we had to bring in reinforcements... Tay n Kat! Oh but i shall never forget that day!
