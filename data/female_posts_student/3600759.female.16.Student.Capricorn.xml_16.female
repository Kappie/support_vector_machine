I was Soooooooo NERVOUS at first but then I got over it and calmed down as soon as Mike Bradley showed me the ropes at the wave pool and Ryan Englebert showed me the ropes at shot gun. I am still really nervous but not as much. I didnt have to work today so i cleaned my room and watch TV cause it was raining so it was really a blah day. I have to work deep agian tomorrow too. Tomorrow is my first all day deep shift, yeasterday I came in at 11:00 and broke people in deep, but tomorrow I have to actually work all day and be in the rotation. Ok well that's all for now I guess. Maybe tomorrow. I'll let you know if I get a rescue tube for my first deep rescue!!!
