"Passed with flying colors"...what the hell does that mean?  How can colors fly and why does it mean you've passed?  Yeh, um, anyway, back to my inspirational post, you can call me anytime and scream as loud as you want into my phone, using code names, of course.   And the whole anger thing, you can be mean, I can be meaner.  That's all you need to know, so I know that you won't be in bad moods around me, now, will ya?   And for the heak of it, I'm sorry everyone for...um...not going to your school.    Oh, speaking of screaming, I got to scream today AND it was recorded.  Boy howdy, I was in a recording studio before Josh.  Now thats just wrong.  But I really enjoyed it.  Now, for all the rest of the people on the BLog who are incredibly confused now, I was asked by my drama teacher to do this skit thingy for a company that sent CDs of their products out.  It involved a very 50's "Leave it to Beaver" skit thing at the beginning.  I played Peggy Sue, the older, sarcastic sister to Wilber, the equivalent to the Beaver.  It was fun, although the kid who played Wilber is really mean.  But other than that it was super fun, plus I got money, so that makes it a THOUSAND times better.    I'm sick of typing, so I'm going to go.
