I love blogger, but I used to be sort of bummed that it didn't have as many features as other diary log things did.         So, now I can write in multiple colors. How fun is that?      Anyway, what I really want to write about is this weird dream I had. I dreamt that I went to go visit Carson's college with someone. I don't remember with whom or why, but i did.     And so, I wanted to talk to Carson of course and I found her sitting on this jungle gym...at her college. She was sitting inside one of those little protective tunnel things with a group of friends. And, when I went up to see her, she stopped talking when I went up there and urged all her friends to stop talking too. I wondered why this was until I started to leave, feeling a bit dejected and dissipated. But, on my way down from this jungle gym, I heard them all arguing like my group of friends used to constantly do in junior high.     It made me feel bad for her, but at the same time, I felt in my heart that it was probably her doing. I don't know, this dream just really reminded me of junior high times and even today's times somewhat with my little group of friends. It made me hope to God that that isn't the kind of group I'll be with for the rest of my life. Don't get me wrong. I love my friends to death and I wouldn't change them but, less arguing over inconsequential things (this is really being directed toward my junior high days more than high school) would have been nice. I just thought it was an interesting reflective dream for me.      I'm excited to go out to dinner tonight, but at the same time sad. Another potentially good friend lost. It makes me sad. Well, happy dreaming everyone.      Much Love ~ XOXO  :)
