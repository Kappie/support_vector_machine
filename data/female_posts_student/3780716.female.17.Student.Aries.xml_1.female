I will be gone until Saturday! I hope I have myself some fun! I really do because I didn't even wanna go but I told myslef the only way I would go was if Krysten went...and she is going so now I am going. I hope there is no DRAMA even though there seems to always be some! Today was a pretty boring day. Nothing too exciting. I was tired this morning because my dad had a gig last night. It was really good. I always enjoy goingto hear him sing though. I love it! So yah-I wen tot church, then ate, then came home and them my Mesha calls (James' gf) to see if my mom and I wanted to join them for dinner at Olive Garden. So we went and the food was GOOD! I like olive Garden! I got full fast though...I was so excited cause I got to eat shrimp Mmm Mmm Mmm :o) So yuppers-we came home and I had to pack my clothes for camp. I am GONNA BE SLEEPY!!! I am gonna miss everyone though! Uh huh...k, now I have nothing to say so I will go now...luv you mucho xoxo...
