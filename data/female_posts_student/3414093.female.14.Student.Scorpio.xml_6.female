I blame Adam for that...he started talking about contortionists the other day.  Anyways...so when Keri saw the contortionist this big comic book-esque speech bubble popped up and it said 'Oh my!' and then my alarm went off...it was funny...the silent film...even though it was scary I just thought it was odd that I dreamt a silent film.  XOXO  P.S. James is back...he was just getting drunk...thats why he hadn't been online.  Anyways...bye!
