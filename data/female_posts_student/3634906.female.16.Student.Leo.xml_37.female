Ellen, Chadd, Kale (sp?), dad, Kevin, Jamie, Amanda, and I. We left here at about 10:00am and headed to Ding's Dock in Waupaca, Wisconsin. On the way there and the way home we played the "name that tune, artist, and album" game and it made the trip a lot shorter. The end totals were: Kevin - 32, Jamie - 24, Amanda - 14, Dad - 10, and myself - 14. It was fun. Artist and song title were worth 1 point a piece and album worth 2... This was my 7th year there. When we got there we realized how much the place had changed since last year. The big boat that used to take you out to the river was replaced with a little one and we didn't even have to jump off it!!! They put in a little pier to get off on and get into the canoes off of. That was the biggest shock. But otherwise it was all the same old stuff, just more fun. Amanda and I sunk our canoe 3 or 4 times. But I realized that it is a lot more fun if you sink it. Even if we couldnt dump it ourselves so Chadd or my dad would. Chadd was hilarious, he sunk our canoe. HAHA. I adore him, he actually wasnt scared to talk to Amanda and I. Oh crap, I forgot to tell y'all about the crazy alien bug we had in our canoe. He was huge! He look like a cross of a cockroach and a centipede and an earwig. He was horrific. And he was about 2 1/2 inches long. AHHH. Amanda and I were terrified. And we had a visit from 3 different spiders, huge spiders. Oh wait I forgot the very super canoe wash we got. Amanda and I trailed behind a bit so we got to the place that my family always stops to rest and splash random people and we got a canoe wash. Most of the time I would have been upset but it was a lot of fun and really refreshing. I dont know but this trip had a lot of memorable times on it and they seem to be forgotten as soon as I get on here, even so I had an absolute blast! Um... Well tomorrow will be my recovery day. I'm feeling really beat up. I am completely drained of all energy physically and mental. I dont know why but I'm beating myself up emotionally and its for such a stupid reason. I really just need to forget about it, but at the same time I really dont want to. I always get myself into situations where I get attached and then dump off on my ass. I dont know I just need to give it up, much easier said than done.  well nighty night -gabby
