Dave is back...but I didn't get a chance to talk to him cuz I had detention...and the guy supervising was a total reject and didn't know how to tell time.  Awesome Guy (Jon) seems really pissed at Dave...poor Dave...but it was his choice to go to the library and not hang out with us...GO BOOKS!!!  Today on the way home on the bus I saw Eileen (stepmom) driving.  I immediatly had this overwhelming sensation of utter disgust.  Got home, had a shower (I was bloody dirty from rugby...it was rainy) and now I'm here...I should do my science before I forget and get caught up in talking to people on msn...speaking of which I haven't talked to James for like five days :( Keri was really happy when I told her that, said that I belong with Dave, not James :( oh well...I miss James...but Dave IS hot...but still...jaaaaammmmmeeeessss....
