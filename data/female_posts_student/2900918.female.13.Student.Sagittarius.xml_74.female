I needed to go to the further away place to buy my lunch cuz i needed to get my new specs there.  aniwaex, on my way bac, there was a report on the singapore idol auditions tt is going on right now. There were thousands of participants waiting for their turn and the waiting area was abt 400 sq cm..   I never approved of the spore idol shit. It's a typical waste of the participants' time. I mean, so what if u're crowned the spore idol? What kind of singing career will u get? Ppl are not going to buy ur album aniwaex, even if they do, how long do u think ure gonna last in this industry.  spore's a small place.  Unless u break into the american/british market, ure going nowhere. Or maybe u can convert urself into a mandopop singer and break into the taiwan market. If ure not gonna do that, i bet ur career wouldnt last long enuff to feed ur family.  Talking about it just makes me angry!  |September never stays this cold|Great Romances Of The 20th Century|TBS
