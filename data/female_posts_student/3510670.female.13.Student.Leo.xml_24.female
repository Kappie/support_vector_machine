       
      Your are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen You shine just like sunlight rays On a winter snow I just had to tell you so  Your eyes sparkle as the stars Like the moon they glow Your smile could light the world on fire Or did you know?  Your minds full of everything That I want to know I just had to let you know I just had to tell you so Your're my butterfly Fly high..
