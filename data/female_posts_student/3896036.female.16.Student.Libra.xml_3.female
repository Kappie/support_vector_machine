After the trip, we were late for Intro to H lecture, so we ran for the stupid bus 23. While running, my sandals strap broke. So i was like running with a broken sandal on the wet floor, my jeans all soaked in gross water.  I have just finished viewing all 70 pics we took on grace chan's birthday last fri. It was   super   fun! Chan didnt know about the surprise birthday party we (charmaine, carene, cheryl, grace khoh, julianne, peini, zibin  i) were gonna have for her, so she was sulking the whole day (a few days actually) as her good friends "told" her that they could not celebrate it with her. On fri, grace khoh "lured" her back to her house and then we were with the bdae cake! We had a good time, especially with all those food - brownies, chickens, chocolate fondue, oh ya, and bao!  I really really  miss  my sec sch friends. We use to hang out so often, but now with our busy schedules, we have to  plan  to meet. So many wonderful memories...
