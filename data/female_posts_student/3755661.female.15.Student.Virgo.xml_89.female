They run so fast and the field is so big that their legs look so funny, it makes me laugh everytime a man runs.  (That's a lot)  Their legs look so tiny and then the different colored shin guards running across the grass.  All the contrast in colors just makes it look even funnier. I was cheering for the Iraq soccer team when I saw them play.  Not because they are from a country that hates us and I'm looking down my nose at them, no. I was cheering because the wild card teams rarely do well.  So I was like "WHOOOOO" when they kept scoring. Thats so super. Yuck. my dad made me do some of the dishes today.  So gross. I hate it when I get to the bottom of the pile and they have all the grossness from the dishes on top of them on them.  Okay I know that was probably too much information.  Again I was eating more potato salad today,  because I love potato salad, and I burped again. It smelled so bad. Sooooooo bad.  Unbelievably believable bad. Japaners like hitting home-runs. Japaners still like hitting home-runs. Damn those Japaners.  They've hit like a bazillion home-runs.  Thats cool. I love the Office Depot commercial, I was just telling Kaitlin about it here:  Lank says: I love the office depot commercial out right now Lank says: mom walks in with a computer, daughter says "You bought me a computer? Thank you thank you thank you, you so totally rock!!!" Lank says: then dad walks in and says *sigh* "you bought her a computer? Lank says: " Lank says: then mom hands dad a reciept Lank says: dad says "Thank you thank you thank you you so totally rock!!" Lank says: daughter looks at dad with "whats your problem" look on her face Lank says: dad goes "WHOOOOO"  Its so funny. Last night I completely lost a game of Trivial Pursuit.  I felt so stupid. I never feel stupid, but I did last night.  If you look at my report cards, you'd think that I rock at trivial pursuit. Vicki's daughter Katie, who is 13, even beat me.  dad beat me, vicki beat me.  Oh well, I just didn't get the lucky questions like everybody else.  (i.e. What female boxer is the daughter of [I can't remember the exact words but they were along the lines of: the worlds best boxer]) and I'm like "No fair!!!" the sports question I got after that was "what late superbowl star's ring was found under a college student's couch recently?" [again, I have no talent for remembering exact words] and I'm like "What the hell!!".  It was Walter Peyton. My feet are cold.  I shall write more later, but for now, I shall just put this much up.  I still have my trip to the sand piles to write about!!  Take a picture upside-down.  Brie
