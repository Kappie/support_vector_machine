Right now I am fighting the need to sleep, partly because I donâ€™t want to go to bed, and partly because I want to stay on as long as Jesse is on shift so in a sense we can go to bed together.  Tomorrow, or shall I say later today, I am going to make the long trek to school and buy my books for the new semester. Then after that I am going to meet up with Melissa, Minh and their friend Bryan and go see the movie "The Village". It has been forever since the last time I went to see a movie in the theater, so I can't wait.  Other than that I think the majority of my weekend will be spent cleaning and doing laundry.  But I seriously can think of worse things to do.
