All is forgotten about the big fight me and Becca had, and we spent the majority of the day togeter and on good terms. We went to the Jazz Festival in Sacramento today. Its quickly becoming a tradition at my mom's house. We went the saturday before memorial day last year as well. Although I'm not a huge jazz fan, the music is decent, the food good, and the guys are hot. I get to play around on the dance floor with Kim and I even danced with my mom once or twice. It' fun because the only other people on the floor are really old, and no one knowsany real jazz swings, so everyones just playing around.  We're gunna head back tonight. Its all around town, and I think we're gunna go to a few of the hotels that have opened their ballrooms to jazz bands. I'm gunna go.
