The papers that need to be filed are dissipating so I think I'm gonna take a break. Why overwork myself anyway? Although who am I kidding--- this job is not overworking by any means.  I was thinking I need to be nicer. On Sunday three guys, two in a period of twenty minutes, told me I had on a cute skirt. That it was the perfect skirt to wear on a summer day. My reply was something like, okay thanks. No conversation from me. It's not that they were unattractive. They were attractive. I just didn't think about it. Really I think they must be gay. I mean really, what straight guy is gonna come up to you and tell you, you are wearing a cute skirt? I guess maybe a straight guy that thinks you're cute. And I am, so that doesn't surprise me :)  I think there is something wrong with me. I went to a party on Saturday at a friend's house and didn't even ask if there were going to be cute guys there. Needless to say, there were not any. But still. Normally I ask these things. Either I'm a lesbian or I'm okay with being single. Well wait....I didn't ask if there were any cute girls there either so I guess I'm okay.  I did run into a cute guy in the elevator today. He'd be cuter if he was shorter and a little fatter. Okay maybe he wasn't all that cute. And of course, I looked trashy. I don't know why I can't keep this dressing up thing going. I always notice more people looking at me when I dress up. Okay maybe it's only Mexicans, and those big fat guys, but still. But who wouldn't want them looking at you? They're hot!
