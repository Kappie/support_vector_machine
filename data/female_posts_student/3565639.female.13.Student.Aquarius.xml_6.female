I really miss my frens..fOoxaH,b*loh,p*joh,BliaNa,intan,MyrA and more~!I really miss my primary skool life.Ok this song is dedicated to my frenZ~            Clear my eyes, it's the morning after  Did I fall in love, or did I find disaster?  Take a second just to breathe  I pick my heart up off my sleeve, yeah   There she goes and I know she knows  By the way she eased out on her tippy toes  Skip the breakfast tea for two  We made no plans to rendeavous, yeah   Someone for everyone but no one for me (No one for me)  Constantly searching for the love I need to...   Basic Chorus:  Build my world around, around  I'll be the lonely one until I find someone  The one I build my world around, around  So, bring the arms of love until I find the one  The one I build my world...   Lazy days, I'm in a hazy phase  Of watching countless ways in which my life goes crazy  Foolishness to blame  Still, it pains me all the same, yeah   Empty faces with empty gazes  In a race of change, I'm losing faith in my pace  Trying to keep my feet before I fall   I'm on this endless road with nothing to see (Nothing to see)  Constantly searching for the love I need to...   Repeat chorus ['the one' replaces 'someone']   A cornerstone of honesty (All around)  A foundation of gravity and freedom (All around)  A clear and concrete understanding (All around)  A love that's best kept safe and sound   It's amazing how we fear the maybe  It's from ourselves we so often run  Abandon fear and consequence of heartbreak  Expose the truth and give yourself to love   We've all been set up to be disappointed  We have to crawl before we learn to fly  It's a blur that moves right into focus  Removes the doubt, aligns your heart and mind   Repeat chorus x 1.5 [overlap last verse/first verse]  (Just say it, just say it, just say it, just say it,  yeah yeah, oh, baby)  So bring the arms of love until I find the one  The one I build my world...
