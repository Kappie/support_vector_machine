Watching the video given to mrs.brown made me cry cuz it was reallllly sad. 4th cuz Paola was crying and i was just sad. then u know on and off. Then...we got to open our letters that our parents wrote us at the beggining of the year...and i cried so much..i was really sad. Then i left to go to the bus, when i walked down the stairs alot of ppl were waiting for me u know>for hugs but i didn't see ryan anywhere. I looked all over the place for him at the bus loop but..he was no where to be found...i even went over to his bus and i couldn't find him!!...i felt so horrible...i started crying. then i quit..u know tryin to hold it in but after francesca got off the bus i just...really started crying...i just really can't believe im leaving so sudden...i didn't get to say goodbye to Ryan :( *tear**** and im gonna miss francesca soo much. *sigh/tear* *sobs*...im really sad. really really sad.
