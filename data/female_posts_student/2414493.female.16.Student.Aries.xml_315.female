It's really funny how a few days offline can really affect your sanity. I started waking up in the mornings feeling lost. I didn't  talk  to people enough, which is weird, since I know people here and everything. I'm grateful that they fixed it without cost. They just stuck a wireless card in and then stuck my card in and voila! it worked. Funny business.
