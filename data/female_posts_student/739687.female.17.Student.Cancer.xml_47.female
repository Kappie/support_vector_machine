Anyways...I'm really bored right now, and I have nothing to do. Oh, by the way...a reminder: Check out  urlLink North Star  August 30th at The Door, Ft Worth! And if you dont go then I'll burn down your house!  So anyways...I'm still really bored. Well, I'm gonna go get some Advil and pass out in my room...I'll see yall when I wake up.
