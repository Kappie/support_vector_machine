You could duplicate the situation you're in for another person and the feelings would be different. We are all so different. Sometimes I wonder what makes us hate or love. Not the scientific answer. Just that feeling you get. The overwhelming and wonderfully consuming feeling when you're with the person you love, or the horrible, sickening feeling around the person whom you hate, or who hates you. What makes that irresistible attraction, and what makes it die? The doubts that come into your head, how only in hindsight do you realise what you once had was perfect. And that now it is not. Time. Time is a strange thing. It can make or break relationships, it can heal the greatest of wounds, and it can spark amazing life-changing change. mmm...will it work? I suppose... time ...will tell.
