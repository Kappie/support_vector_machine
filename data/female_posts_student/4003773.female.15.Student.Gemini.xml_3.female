I write a lot, which you might already know.  I just got home from volleyball camp earlier today.  It was the last day of camp.  I liked the camp a lot, but I'm still really glad it's over.  I hadn't played volleyball for like a month and the camp was Monday through Thursday and on Tuesday and Wednesday it was from nine in the morning to nine at night, while on Monday it was from twelve to nine and Thursday it was only from nine to twelve.  You might be able to imagine though how sore I would be from doing almost nothing for a month and then playing volleyball for three or four days straight.  Pretty much any movement is painful.  Last night I crawled up the stairs because it hurt less and I offered to pay my dad to go get something from down stairs for me.  He tried to do it for free, but he got the wrong thing so my mom did it.  lol.  The worst is siting down and standing up and stairs.  I guess it was worth it though.  The camp was at the U of M.  It was really cool because the vb players and the vb staff from the U of M were the coaches and at the end the signed autographs.  They taught really different tecniques that they apparently got from the national team.  I think I might try their tecniques out, but we'll see.  So now I'm finally home, camp is over and Sofia convinced me to make a blog.  Actually, she didn't really convince me she just said she'd made one and showed me hers and I decided to make one.  I could decide what to do for my username though... I'm not at all creative, so Sofia helped me come up with sunriserezzie.  Rezzie is the name of my cat, but she died a couple years ago.  Now I have a cat named Avril.  I feel really bad for her though, buecause she has ear mites.  She just went to the vet this week for a check up and got treated for the mites, but I think she got them back because she's got the symptoms back.  She shakes her head and there is a rattling sound in her head.  She must be pretty uncomfortable.  I feel sooo bad for her.  I'm going to talk to my mom about it and maybe she'll go back to the vet.  O well.  I better stop writing before this post gets too long.  By the way, I didn't edit this so if something doesn't make sense and there are weird errors that is why.  Bye!
