Juice is toxic.   Letâ€™s dance to the music,  Conversing with movement.  Exchanged glances,  Hunger for love.   Beautiful yet hideous,  Camouflaged with makeup and fabrics.  Lavishness is celebrated.  Surrender to your fragility.  Escape to a manmade heaven.  Oblivious to reality.   A temporary cure for the urbanites.
