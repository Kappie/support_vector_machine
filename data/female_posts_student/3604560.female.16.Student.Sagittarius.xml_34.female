You probably can't tell because I have a Lord of the Rings-related name. That's my obssession and there are 11 other people on this blog (or will be eventually) will attest to this. And Tina? HARRY POTTER IN 1 1/2 DAYS! I absolutely can't wait! It's going to be good, I can tell. If not, I'm still gonna buy the DVD when it comes out coz that's what I do. I have sets and they must be complete or else I go crazy trying to complete them. 6 Months until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Extended Edition Collector's Box Set comes out! Phew, thats a type-full (since it didn't involve me saying it). Anyways...toodles until after I've seen the Prisoner ot Azkaban!
