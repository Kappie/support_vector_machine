JACKet... lol.  okay, yeah. -_-;;  so chuan and I were spying on him, and then we got the idea that wouldn't it be so cool if we got to didy's house before he did?  you know, public transportation beating private transportation?  awesome, ain't it?  so then I got  really  hooked onto that idea.  I mean,  REALLLY  hooked onto it.  So I made chuan look out the window into the cars passing us to see if any of them were jack.  and they weren't.  so it was like that the entire drive to didy's stop, which, luckily, was first!  so we got off, and I was hyper as freaking heck.  I wanted to  beat jack , darnit!  so I started running around.  except I didn't know where to go.  so I kept running in the wrong direction.  but luckily, I got into the right alleyway.  yay!  but then I was running so funnily and so boucily that my backpack got jostled open and all my stuff spilled out.  right in the middle of the alleyway.  and then I totally lost it.  totally.  in the middle of the freaking alleyway with all my stuff spilled out in a circle around me.  I just sat down and laughed and laughed and laughed.  and kailing and didy had to pick up all my stuff for me.  man.  then I went into didy's house from the back and AMAZINGLY... jack wasn't there yet!  then chuan went and looked out the front cuz he thought he heard a car and lo and behold!  there was jack!  and then he came in and I lost it all over again.  actually, I hadn't quite found it after losing it the first time yet... lol.  it was funny.  then we were supposed to work on script.  but we kinda got into a huge pingpong match.  it was usually didy and me against jack and chuan or jack and kevin.  then I played jack by myself.  it was lots of fun.  not much script getting done, though.  but at all times, there was at least one person working on script.  so that was good, I guess.  kailing has this huge thing against camera phones.  which made taking pictures of her that much more fun.  lol.  poor her.  anyways.  so we all got into didy's room and messed around.  didy's bed is freakishly bad.  and then there was much spraying of perfume.  then more pingpong!  yaya.  it was v. fun.  then my mom picked me up and we ate out.  then we went to gap!  and spent $60 there buying $75 worth of stuff.  b/c it was a spend $75 get $15 off thing.  lol.  yeah...  it was mostly stuff for my mom and brother, though.  =)  b/c I am not vain like that.  my brother got these cool pants that had like 17 pockets on it... it was sooo cool.  I mean, literally, 17 pockets.  it was like cargo pants, except one of the pockets on one side was like an organizer thing... you could open it and there were those pencil loop things and little pouches and zippers and a keychain thing.  I had fun opening and closing those things.  aaaanyways.  so that was my friday.  I came home and started reading a book for FUN.  I went to sleep at 5 in the morning.  I got up at 11 to eat then went back to sleep on saturday.  it was snowing!  then kailing called me at 1 and told me ppl were coming at 1.30... so I hurried up and got up.  then kai came at 1.3o and we went out and built a snow hippo!  =D  it was mucho fun.  and then jack came and he insulted our hippo.  then we went in and then didy and chuan came.  they played a lot of ssb while kai and I typed away t the script.  we actually did a lot of work!  then we took a break and went ouside to play in the snow.  the v. rare snow that's all gone now.  =(  we went to the bike trail and had the BEST snowball fight EVER.  it was boys against girls... but then kai just stood there and didy was v. wimpy.  she was either running away from chuan and jack or just standing there looking.  and I was the only one who was actually hitting them.  and I shoved show down both their shirts.  =D  cuz they kept hitting kailing who wouldn't hit back b/c of the dirty snow.  psh.  and i was only wearing one of my sleepy shirts and a thin jacket.  with no gloves.  while my brother and jack both had gloves and jack had this whole snow suit thing.  it wasn't fair.  but I got them good, man.  got them good.  =D  I made a snow heart for kailing, but she wouldn't be my valentine!  so didy was my valentine.  =(  then the boys kept hitting me in the head and I ate so much dirty snow it wasn't funny.  jack kept apologizing for hitting me, which took a lot of fun out of that.  man.  anyways.  then they got tired of it and wanted to go in.  I wanted to fight some more.  but alas... no.  *sigh*  so then inside.  changed.  more ssb.  kai and chuan and I hung out in my room then went down for hot chocolate.  then didy and jack came down for some.  then we started discussing plot ending.  we got one!  kai had to go home, though.... but the rest ended up staying for dinner.  my dad recorded them eating and then he and my mom watched the video of them eating.  jack was watching, then he stopped when it was just him watching himself eat.  lol.  it was funny.  then upstairs again.  chuan and I were working on script.  jack and didy playing ssb still.  then didy worked on script with me.  chuan and jack play ssb.  then they finally stopped playing ssb and all crowded around me.  i got claustrophobic.  jack then started asking us about his body language.  and here was the whole sinister grin thing.  it was funny as freaking heck.  he cannot manage a sinister grin for the life of him.  just a sort of happy grimace thing.  lol.  so then chuan got onto the other computer and got online.  online=AIM.  and then he and jack were talking to jeff while didy and I were working.  it was valentine's day....  so.... yeah.  lots of interesting things.  the threesome thing came from me asking jeff on chuan's sn if he wanted to be chuan's valentine.  he said no.  then I asked if he would be didy's.  he dotdotdotted.  then jack said "chuan and didy     it's a threesome", meaning jeff, chuan, and didy all valentines of each other.  lol.  and that got into jeff's profile.  didy wanted him to take it off, jack wanted him to keep it on, chuan and I were just laughing.  then back to script.  more typing.  then I played speed online while jack chuan didy were doing some strange thing on my brother's computer.  man. no more script after that.  they finally all left at around 10.30.  9 hours after kai first showed up.  maaaan.  then I got online and chatted.  then I went to sleep at 2 cuz I was reading again.  lol.  this morning got up at 11.30 and was sad about lack of snow.  then ate a bit, got online, and worked until 1 when I went over to chuan's.  okay.  rest of sunday coming later.  it's 12.30 and I gotta go practice my speech some.  byebye.  ++sunny
