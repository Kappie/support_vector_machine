I'm gonna be with coach in the gym so I can tell people how fun the track team is and how much fun and how much hard work goes into running. What a way to spend my Sunday. But yea that whole "turning back the clocks" thing totally messed me up cause like... I woke up at 7 this morning and its like... it would really be 8, so in reality I woke up at 8 but the clock said 7... so can you see why I'm messed up. Like, for this post, it'll say around 10:15ish... but like, really, if it was yesteday or Friday it would say 11:15ish.... stop the maddness!!!
