The people who called me tonight weren't the usual people and they usual people I shall not say who I think it is....but it's just pissing me off cause it's so stupid to keep on doing this. I mean once in a while is ok, but every weekend is ridiculous. But anyways they were all talkin in Chinese accent which is totally stupid cause I could so tell it wasn't a real person. Yea well then my mom took the phone and she's like oooo the police is trackin your call, what bull shit. Then I went online and some people (i wish not to tell) went and were sayin stuff like to stop talkin about Brandon and my ass being gross. Now this is what really irritates me, when people make fun of my ass. Like seriously how 2nd grade is that? But whatever i don't care if my ass is big cause i know that it is...but common people it's time to grow up, we're freshman not 2nd graders. And this gets me to talking about me wondering how the hell some people are popular. They act all childish and stupid and it's just so irritating. I've come to see that popularity is a joke, funny how i've come to realize this just now.
