After school was when the fun began. So we had our tech rehearsal for one acts today. I got to west campus about 3:30 and didn't actually go on stage until about 8:00. Yeah...not cool. I was so upset, I thought I was seriously going to cry. It was horrible. Sam, Tamara and I went to Wendy's to buy our cast food, which was fun. We spent $32 there. Fun times. But anyway, I'm tired as all hell, and I really must be going to bed. By the way, I saw the other night of one acts last night, and they were really funny. I laughed my ass off. You should have been there...that's ok, just come see me tomorrow, 7:00, LP west campus!
