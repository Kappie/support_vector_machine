I wanted to take things slow however, I let my body glide me through the run. If it wanted to go slow I would. I didn't' have my watch with me so I didn't' time it, but it felt like a nice pace. I kept up with my brother (usually 9:30 pace) so either he slowed down for me or kept that pace. Either way that run was the best run in a long time. I have a longer run this Saturday with my group. It should be another good run!   good luck with your weekend race or training run.
