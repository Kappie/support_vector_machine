Anyway i have survived today, but the most stupid thing happened in physics, what happened was we were using reed relay, which you need a magnet of some kind! So when we went to tidy up there was a magnet missing - just a bog standard magnet! anyway our teacher got really annoyed and made us stay in after the lesson - we had to go to spanish though so she made us all come back before lunch, or we would get a detention. So we went back after lunch and had a 10 min talk with the head of faculty. All just for the stupid bar magnet! Then we were late for lunch! so anyway we are all a little bit narked with our teacher! Anyway in spanish we had our aural exams - it went really well, i think i got full marks! ;) - anyway ttyl cos i need to get work done! hedge
