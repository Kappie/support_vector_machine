"You break my heart into a million pieces and you say it's because I deserve better?"        "Never ruin a picture.The memories don't change . . .The people in them do.."         "I bet you're hard to get over. I bet the moon just wont shine"      "Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it."        "You've come to a point where nothin matters anymore and the things you ssed to care about aren't worth Fighting for. But I'm still here and I always will be.."         "Someday they'll find your small town world on a big town avenue. Lie to me and try to say you never will. We've fallen in love... it was the best idea i ever had. You remind me of the times when I knew who I was. Write me off... cuz I'd rather starve now if you won't open up. Faded memories torn apart by life's disease again. I think I made it a game to play your game and let myself cry. This time I'm not going to watch myself die"         I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair.     I hate the way you drive my car,     I hate it when you stare.     I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind.     I hate you so much it makes me sick,it even makes me rhyme.     I hate the way you’re always right, I hate it when you lie.     I hate it when you make me laugh,     even worse when you make me cry.      I hate it when you’re not around,     and the fact that you didn’t call.     But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you,     not even close…not even a little bit…not even at all.          I don't care anymore if I let you down     I believe that I need to be free     I'm so used to my life with you around     I don't know anymore . . . . the real me     And I thought that I found myself todayAnd I thought that I had control     All the change in my life just fell away     For a moment I didn't need you     All these tears that I've cried     You must be tired of taking care of me but     Its what you do best and I'm a liar cause really its what I need     Someone like you     Someone like me     Maybe its change that set you free     Free . . .             I would have done anything for you,       I would have died for you,       I loved you with all my heart,       I looked past all your flaws,       I made you my life,       And now I have to let you go.
