Its kind of sad to think that my whole life here at work for the better part of 4 years fits in one small paper box.  Granted I still have tomorrow and Thursday to work, tie up any loose ends and collect anything I may have forgotten, but I have had it pretty good here, the people are annoying (and sometimes gimpy and smelly) but many are a lot of fun, the pay was good (even though I always bitched I wanted more $$) and I didn't really *do* much but blog and chat on aim, which while boring is still pretty cushy, but something about this job just wasn't for me.  Wasn't the direction I wanted to go.  Why is this post so whiny.  Whatever.  I'm not acutally sad to be moving on, I'm glad that I have a chance to get out while I'm still young and can go the direction I want, but I'm just nervous that there is something big I'm either a) forgetting to tell the peopel to do or b)leaving behind at the office.  Oh well, I can always come visit.  Better to be outside lookin' in than inside looking out.
