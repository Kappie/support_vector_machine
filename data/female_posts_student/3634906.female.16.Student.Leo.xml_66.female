This year is going to be so much more different than the last... I mean I wont have every class with Mandy... AHHH... But it will be nice to have to make new friends and talk to new people and not feel so dependent on someone else... I'm excited... Also sad because I wont have Mrs. McSorley or Ms. Hagemann anymore... WAHHH... and my art class isnt going to be the same anymore... everyone in my last year took drawing and painting and I went against the crowd and took Multicultural Media... I am so excited about it!!! I dont know this year will be different but change isnt always a bad thing... it can be very good...      Sumathy leaves today... her train gets in at 5:00pm so we have to leave at about 4 to get there on time... It's sad to see her go but I bet she's ready to get home... Mayville's a bore... but I actually did more with her than I expected to... It was fun!!! Now I need to go and visit her... OoO... tonight I am going to have Britt and James over to watch the Kill Bill's... neither of them have seen the first on so I have to sit through that and then watch the second... I also need to get together with Mandy and watch Y Tu Mama Tambien... what a great movie... haha... its more like a soft porn but still good... haha... no I like it because of Diego Luna... haha... well got to go we are going to registered...  then I have to get in my last few hours of hangin' with sumathy before she takes off...     adios     -gabby
