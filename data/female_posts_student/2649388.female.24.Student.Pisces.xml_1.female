My dear boy friend decided to take a 2-hour lunch break and go "check out" the job fair.  No, he wasn't there to look for a job.  And no, he didn't go as one of their company's recruiter ...   I remember during the time, I was hiding-in in the lab, away from the freezing wind chill, with space heater right next to me, and sipping hot chocolate.  Then his ICQ message popped up.    "Hey, I am gonna go to UCSD job fair."  "Really?  As Websense (the company he works for) representative?" "No ... I just want to get some toys ..." "... ..."  O.K. So he went solely because of the toys.     2 hrs later, he came back, and start grumbling about how he only got two pens and there were no good toys ...  I guess guys will always have a child-like heart, no matter how old they get.    My roommate's Beta fish  My roommate's little beta is not eating.  Obviously, he is not doing so well under this cold weather and is losing his appetite.  According to my roommate, beta fish would be the happiest, living under water between 75 F ~ 80 F.  If you check weather.com, you would know that right now Cambridge is no where near 75 F (in fact, it's -9 F).  So we decided to move the fish to the kitchen, right next to the stove, and hope that he will do better there ... Nope.  That didn't work either.  Last night before I went to sleep, I checked on him ... His food was still floating at the surface of the water, and he was still not eating.  Hum ...  Today my roommate decided to move the fish again.  Now he is right next to the space heater ... We were kinda concerned before, worried that the space heater might be too hot for the fish, but I guess my roommate eventually decided that, she rather has her fish boiled than chilled to death.  =/  ... Good luck, little beta.  I hope you will do better soon.    Cold Cold Cambridge  Weather.com says that the temperature is -9 F right now, and still dropping.  With the wind factor, it "feels" like -25 F.  Great.    I have been getting a lot of concerning ICQ messages from my friends in California ...  The first thing they say is always: "I heard that it's really cold in Boston right now ..."   Eh, yeah, you got that right.  On TV, CNN was showing news about people doing egg test along side of the road (you crack an egg open and see how long it takes to freeze).   It can freeze under 20 mins.  (NO, Bryan, I am NOT going to try it myself.)  As I was standing in the cold wind at 7pm in the evening, waiting for school shuttle, I was seriously worried about freezing my toes off ...   I miss California. *sob*
