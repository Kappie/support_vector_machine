One of my classmates said "Manda is our savior," today in class.  I didn't really take a sense of flattery from that, it was more like "Damn straight!"  I can't believe I finished it.  I started editing on Tuesday... TUESDAY!  And I only had to stay afterschool for one day, but that was for over an hour.  And I took time out of Creative Writing and Social to work on it, so whatever.  I kinda miss my old News Broadcasting class.  There are some overly-active souls that I don't miss, but there are other cool cats that gave the class good energy, which my current class DEFINITELY lacks.  We're a laid-back bunch, which isn't very productive for the show.  I wish someone would teach me new tricks for editing... *cough*cough*.  I'd teach myself, but when I have THREE DAYS to edit an episode BY MYSELF, I tend to go for a more streamlined approach.    Well, Bloggers and Bloggettes, I should be going on my merry way now.  Don't drive too angry.    Damn the Swans, Manda
