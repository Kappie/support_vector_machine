They are not listening to anything I say. I guess kids will be kids. Kimo is upstairs and he is watching wrestling so I get no help from him of course.  Well on a better note, tomorrow I am going shopping. We are going down to the Portland Mall. I have to get Jordan the Power Ranger Dino Thunder backpack and lunch box. That is one thing that he really wants for starting Kindergarden.  Well be back in a few, someones gotta use the phone.
