It was a million times cooler than the Collosseum, cause even though it wasnt as big, there werent a million tourists from Brooklyn, or a buncha gates everywhere.  This place was beautiful, too!  It was well preserved, but just ruined enough to feel like we'd just stumbled upon it. It was overgrown slightly and just, in all, breathtaking.  I loved it so much more than the Collosseum.  Or however its spelled.
