I can with all my ten feet in twenty doors and with the eleventh one in the nose still perform ballets But if I could how I wanted I wouldn´t want anything at all But I know that everybody is ought to want something -  We can do everything exactly like the pippin trained monkeys we only must want we only must want we only must want we only must  Do I always have to must what I can One hand in the stars the other one in the ass of the front man? This is the land of the limited impossibilities We can ride horses backwards without legs We can everything that is too tight widen with the percussion drill We can be lucky and nonetheless lead affiliated groups  We can do everything just like the pippin trained monkeys we only must want we only must want we only must want we only must"   Good afternoon? (" urlLink Guten Tag ")   "My voice against your cell phone My wrists against your nail care lotion My teeth against the ones of Dr. Best and his son My soul against your soft epilation  It was in the selling off, in the offerings, this special action Exchange of dumb old life for a new version I had it barely tested at home when I already knew that there was something wrong with this product - this is the reclamation  Good afternoon good afternoon I want my life back I do not exchange anymore I want my life back Good afternoon I admit I was delighted first but your life does not tweak and pressure only when you stoop - Good afternoon  My voice against the one of the whole talkshow nation My wrists for a tired Halleluja and beans My teeth against your tame revolution Visions against the absolute television  It was in the selling off, in the offerings, this special action Exchange of dumb old life for a new version I had it barely tested at home when I already knew that there was something wrong with this product - this is the reclamation  Good afternoon good afternoon I want my life back I do not exchange anymore I want my life back Good afternoon I admit I was delighted first but your life does not tweak and pressureonly when you stoop - Good afternoon"
