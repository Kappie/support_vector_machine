Now that I realize I havn't cared it bothers me that I don't. I need to care what kind of grades I get. I need to be studying for semester tests. But somehow I can't force myself to study or get up when my alarm goes off in the morning, because I just don't seem to care.  I need to figure out who I am and what I'm doing in life. Doesn't everyone need to figure that out. Maybe its more that I want to figure out who I am, not that I need to. Everyone wants things, hardly anyone ever needs something. Its so frustrating not understanding yourself or not even knowing yourself. I look in the mirror and all i see is a 5" coat of make-up covering up who I am. The plaster is so perhaps no one can see inside my soul, see what I really am. Its as if I have put up an appearance so no one can know my secret, I am lost. People look at me and see: Oh, shes going to be a senior who gets perfect grades, is a cheerleader, yearbook editor, student coucil represenative, BPA state vice president and the list goes on..... But the only reason I am so active in organizations is so that I don't have to think about how I have no idea what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I started making up college majors so when people asked my I didn't have to reply with an "I don't know."  I am still utterly shocked at the fact that I was voted in as BPA vp. I went in sure I wouldn't get an office. I kept reasuring myself, that when I didn't get an office, it wasn't because I wasn't good enough, it was because well I'm not sure why. I was so sure I would stand up and everyone would burst up laughing. Dang, I don't think I was ever so nervous in my life. Not even all the times I was nervous could add up to how nervous I was. I don't maybe I don't give myself enough credit and I'm more then I think I am. But it bothers me when people are all that, and they know they are all that.  I admit I have issues. Issues which I could type about forever. But these issues need to wait so that I may go to bed and then in the morning, 1 hour after my alarm goes off, I will think "Oh shit I forgot to get up and why the helll didn't I study at all for any of my exams today??"
