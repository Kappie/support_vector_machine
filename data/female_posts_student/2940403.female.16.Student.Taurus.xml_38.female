I only got paid fucking $3.50 an hour for two kids... which totals $25!  I have people I need to pay off here!  Come on, those pimps are coming after me!  GIVE ME MY MONEY!  I mean, my parents both think I should be getting at least $4 an hour, and I think $5 an hour would cut it, but how would I say it to them?  They're not the most financially stable people, and I know I should be a little more considerate for those who might need a hand or something... but come on.  Both parents are working, I'm sure they can pay the babysitter a little better than $3.50 an hour for two kids.   God, I feel so totally ripped off and neglected...  and that's not the only reason why.    After babysitting I went to dinner with my aunt.  Then she took me shopping for a birthday present, and I got two new cool lamps.  I was so tired when I got home it took me an hour to put the stupid Target brand lamp together.  How hard can it possibly be?  Yay... then Rachel called and we hung out until 9:30.  She kept me company while I was angry at the world... especially the stupid TV.  The fucking stereo wouldn't work.  Piece of shit.  STOP BEING SO ANGRY I keep yelling at myself.  Fucking hell why am I so bitter?  Maybe I'm just tired.  I don't think so.  I don't want to go to bed... wait... I have to babysit tomorrow again....... for $3.50 an hour....... for two kids............. for 7 hours.  I don't think I'll make it.  No one even bothered to call me to keep me company.  (Thanks for thinking of it though, Scott, even the thought is appreciated.)
