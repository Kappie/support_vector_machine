If it happened over the weekend, it's THERE. Get the picture?     NEway,  the title of this blog is "Let the Gossip and Backstabbing Continue." This is so because, HELLO this is High School. I do NOT plan on living it like my mom did. Only one or two friends, who were constantly being threatened if they didn't make fun of my mom. Once my mom's BF Melda ((i know... weird)) was being threatened that if she didn't call my mom a warthog ((since that's the worst there was back then)) these other girls would basically kick her @$$. So she says, "Rosie, I hate to do this to you but you know I love you. WARTHOG!" And my mom threw her across the floor and into the wall in the cafeteria, which I'm assuming really hurts when smacked against your skull. OUCH.       Yeah  well, since school hasn't started, I'll leave you now. Later daze!
