What a blast from the past! I haven't seen that cockmonkey since form 2.   The Le Grand Hotel was very well decorated with the theme 'A Night In Hollywood', and they had yummy spring rolls and brownies. And it was open bar, but nothing alcoholic unfortunately. Sad face.  I think my mate that I went with (see above) expected a bit more out us going together than I did...   There wasn't an organised afterball though, so we went back to a guys house and had a semi-party. I learnt a wicked drinking game called Circle Of Death, and as it turns out, Jenny learnt the same game on the same night at a different party.  Me, Jen and probably Jonathan are gonna get drunk on Wednesday just because we can. It should be fun. There's apparently a party on Cook St, so maybe we'll cruise by there.           Sometimes I think I'm an alcoholic.
