Cancer, while a terrible disease in itself, is not and  should not be viewed as a death sentence . Most cancers are controllable with the correct treatment. Some can even be cured. The  key is to never give up .  Cancer represents a group of  more than 100 diseases affecting parts of the human body  from the brain to the bones. The human body is composed of individual cells that work together to form organs such as the lungs. Normally, cells will grow, divide and then die - simply fulfilling its life cycle. However, in certain situations, abnormal cells do not die after they divide. With this new-found immortality, these  cells grow out of control ,  starving the body of crucial nutrients and resources  in the process.  Our knowledge of cancer is incomplete. There still exists many important questions that must be answered before we can achieve victory against this terrible disease. However, with broadly-coordinated research in recent years,  there is hope  for the cancer patient if the disease is caught early, before the cancer spreads to many parts of the body, in a process called  metastasis .  Cancer is one of the most  prolific killers in existence . According to the American Cancer Society, about  560,000 people will die  from cancer in the United States alone in 2000, or  more than 1,500 a day . Since 1990, almost  5 million  people have lost their lives due to the effects of this disease. In 2000, about 1 .22 million new cancer cases  are expected to be diagnosed. The current  5-year relative survival rate  for all cancers combined is only about  60% .  Do you have a friend or a loved one who did battle against cancer?
