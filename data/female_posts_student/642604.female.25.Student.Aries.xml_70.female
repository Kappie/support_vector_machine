I wish I could've afforded each night but unfortunately I only had tickets for Friday night. It was all good though, they were right on and I had the best time. The trip came complete with no traffic to Hampton, a hotel room right across the bridge (not as close as I wanted to be but for as late as I made the reservation... excellent), a truck outside the hotel with a giant lobster on top, a cheesy merman triton kind of statue by the hotel sign, a beautiful view of the bay and the aircraft carriers and more phish fans than the eye could see. How much better could it get? I had a blast, i loved it! They opened with Tweezer, they ended with Tweezer, they closed the second set with an incredible version of Possum, it was just so good! I'm psyched and ready to go again, bring it on!
