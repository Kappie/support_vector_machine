       
      i'm quite fired up right now.  my mind's racing, filled with ideas, but unable to settle on any one thing.  i'm currently working in three word processor windows -- my thesis, some notes on one of the books for my memoir course next term, and a paper proposal for a conference -- plus this one.  my brain feels like it's going to explode.
