I actually get what she gave us today. YaY for that. That gives me a bit of confidence for the final. There's no way you can really study for math finals anyway not that I would even if I could. I think I'm going to go with my not studying method again. That's worked for the past 4 sets of finals. :) Maybe I'll study for bowling but that's it. Speaking of bowling, that was fun today. I wasn't doing fantastically but, eh, I just sort of still need to get back in the swing of things.   French was...eh...d'accord. Like the use of the French word while explaining French? Hah. OK, fine. I'm the only one who ever finds my jokes funny. :) That's ok. At least they make me laugh.   Lunch was nice. Just chatted with Carson and did my Satire...err...no, Comedy, we're in comedy now. Well, I did my comedy homework. Good times. Drivers ed./study hall was nice as usual. Heh. I just went and did my homework in the band room. I actually thought about practicing but then I remember how self conscious I am about that and how Dan and Peter are in my lunch hour and that idea got lost. So, I sat and did math homework and read a bit of this book Peter had. The beginning at least was really interesting. It's this compilation of songs this guy likes and he explains each one and why he likes it and whatnot. It's pretty funny actually. I think I may ask Peter if I can borrow it when he's done. I got about 20-25 pages into it. Maybe I'll just go get it from the library. We'll see.   Hmmm, history was boring. I definitely have a paper for that class due tomorrow that I had about three weeks to do. Whoops. I knew I wouldn't do it though so I didn't even bother trying over break. It shouldn't be too difficult anyway. I may actually study for my history final I've decided. Haha, or not. I figure I have to have at least one final for each year that I SAY I'll study for. That way, I think my mother's comforted when I feel at least a tiny ounce of guilt while I'm sitting watching TV with my unopened book by my side.   I was so happy when I got to Satire and Comedy. Today kind of went by slowly. Satire didn't go by too slowly though so it wasn't bad. Haha, we looked up what people do for Kwanza (errr, pardon the spelling if it's incorrect) on the internet. Haha. "Everything you wanted to know about Kwanza and more." It was actually semi-interesting. I'd never really known what Kwanza is. Goodness...I hope I'm spelling the word correctly. Otherwise, I'm probably looking like a pretty dim bulb right now. Other than that we just talked about the different aspects of comedy and such. Fun stuff.   So, today wasn't really bad. It was nice seeing people that I haven't seen too.   Bryan and I are cool now. Like...actually cool. Not, "well, we're ok with each other but we don't really talk." We're actually getting to be friends again. I'm glad. I missed having him to talk to. He's a really good friend.   Things this year aren't exactly starting as I would have expected but...it's not bad. I'm really trying to have a positive outlook on things. Some things are going really well though.   Well, I suppose I could at least go start my essay...um, or not? Or just write random stuff in WORD for about an hour or so like I usually do. Then, around midnight I'll finally just want to go to sleep so I'll finish it in about an hour. Haha. That's the one reason I'm glad I didn't take APUSH. There's so much homework in that class that I just wouldn't have done. I'm more in to European history in the first place...so, yeah. I think I'll take AP Euro next year though. Fun times.   I'll probably be back to write more as I keep avoiding this paper. :)
