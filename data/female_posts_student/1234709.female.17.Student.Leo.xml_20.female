That they can be flushed with such an emotion, and that it rarely retreats. It's too bad that I'm unable to possess that feeling. All I am left with is feelings of infatuation.  So what do you do if you feel like you'll never experience  love ? What if everyday you wonder what  love  even is for the rest of your life? I don't want to go out looking for  love . Because I know that if I do, I'll start making standards, and that's not what  love  is. Or... is it?  No, because as soon as you define what somebody has to have for you to fall in  love  with them in a completely commercialized, idealized, romanticised sense, you could miss the opportunity to be with somebody who could make you truly happy. Because you're not letting  love  find itself, but rather forcing it into the mold of what you think it should be.  ...Am I right?   Love , Kath
