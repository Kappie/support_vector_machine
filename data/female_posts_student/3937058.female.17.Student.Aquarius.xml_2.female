Seems he hath a new lover heehee, tho Luke Mills, who ran for Bignor in sports day (oops, have I said too much??) doesn't know it. Stringer seemed quite overcome when he crossed the finish line. Hahaha. And FYI, Bignor should sooo not have one, tho u did have 2 amazing runners, like grease lightning lol! Highdown did deserve it tho, they had some good peeps too, where did they come from? You year 12 Highdowns were obv holding them back! Chantry as usual showed team spirit (lets hear it!) and it was fun fun fun, and my throat still hurts lol!     On a different note, last night Victor outdid himself on BB with the ledg comments! "I'm the slick man, rapper/part-time hit man" hahahahahahahahahahahaha... and he said that Michelle gettin her boobs out was "standard precedure man" lol. That man almost reaches the ranks of legend, tho isn't quite Reidy standard just yet. He must stay, he's the funniest one there. And did ne1 else think that Shell was scarily good at pole dancing? Neways enough of those goons, I have my own life to lead! This afternoon me, Emma, Helen and maybe Rob (the real Rob, not the other Rob...don't get 2 excited Stringy!) are goin into L'ton, it is the place 2 be after all, and then this evening quite a few peeps r goin 2 Brighton to say farewell to Miss Garas (Man will I miss that VPL lol). Well, as the Stringernator says, feel free to post. Live long and prosper mes amis xx
