Had guitar lessons today, he gave me Hotel California-The Eagles((DUH)), so I could practice going from bar chords to normal chords. It's fun to play though, nice sound.  Mom completely agrees with me on the whole monologue thing and she's going to put on her bitchified outfit and go scream at morehead tomorrow morning. I can't wait.  Ok you've got to try this, I rarely find something that is so entertaining but this make a snowflake thingy is the best!  urlLink Make-A-Flake Here!
