I'm so happy. I'm so very happy. I played it last night and again this morning. I used to kick ass at super mario brothers, now I suck a little. But who cares, it's fun as crap. I'm going to play it again tonight.   Other things:  My caris supposed to be ready on Friday. Supposed to be.  I'm still trying to figure out how to go about this bartending thing.  I might become a paranormal investigator. Maybe. Only if everyone in the organization likes me. Otherwise I won't.   Bad thing:  I have a flea bite that is just a tit too close to my pubic area.   Rant thing:  Now, I have never had an STD before, soI'm finding it hard(in my older years) to understand why someone would have unprotected sex. I mean, just knowing that thereis not muchprotecting mycrotch from those fuckingfleas freaks me the hell out.I just find it funny thatafter people fuck without a condom their biggest worry is "oh my god what if I'm pregnant" and not "oh my God what if my crotch rots away."   End things.   Nikol, are you moving to Milwaukee? If you are... take me with you.
