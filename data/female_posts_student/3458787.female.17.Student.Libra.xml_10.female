But surprise surprise- a week later he broken into the bank once again to return most of the money (104,000 pounds)BACK!   I assume it must have been guilt. " It's NOT your money! You don't need that much money! You thief!" his inner voice must have tormented him inside out. But the interesting part of his whole case is that the robber did not give back all the money. I mean if he is going to go through the trouble of breaking into the bank once again he might as well give back everything he stole. He must have desperately needed the money but felt terribly guilty about stealing and hence he gave back what he no longer required.  How in the world would you classify such a person? You and i both will agree that what he did is wrong- stealing is clearly wrong no matter what. But at the same time, he had the courage and "goodness" in him to return most of the money. Interesting character eh? haha you never know.. he might actually break in yet again and return the rest of the money once he gets it back. Will shall wait and see....
