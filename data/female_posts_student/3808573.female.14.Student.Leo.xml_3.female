This blog is supposed to be about my deepest secrets or dreams or whatever I decide to share with you. I don't know I might be putting insecurities too. I'll give you some updates right now though. I'm really in love with someone right now. His name is Brandon, but I call him Furby. (He got his nickname from a noise he makes that reminds me of a furby ^_^) He lives in California, which makes it really really difficult. I rele care for him. He's supposed to be coming up to KS in July. He's saved $100 so far, which I think is really great. I jus wish he lived closer. I'll write an entry about him later. Gonna end it here.                   K@!   urlLink   (This is my regular site, but this is for deep secrets, only a few will know about this site)
