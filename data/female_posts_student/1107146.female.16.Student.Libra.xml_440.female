And they threatened some pills that would make me vomit up blood for about three weeks, during which I can only eat green...shit.   So today, I got in there right after school. Somehow I've become this uber-being doc model since I was last there...some sort of epitome of health...o except that hole in the guts thing. For some reason they ask a lot of weird questions these days, like GPA. They asked how old I was at least ten times, no joke.  But then...the doctor was prodding my guts and she happened to hit the very spot where it kills...it was a thousand thousand colours, it was incredible. So she said Upper GI (gastro-intestinal) for tomorrow...I get to miss school, yip!, well some of it...which basically means I get to drink chalk and get about three hours of X-rays in the process, so they can make sure I have something to talk about. And if I do, that means I've had an ulcer for the last six years of my existence, and I could see where that could have caused some of those stomach problems I've had over the couple of months.  NOT TO MENTION taking a topical medication that is highly inflammatory to the guts since about the same time! WHEE! So blah...I get to go to another clean place tomorrow, and I don't deal with doctor's offices really well innately. But then they say, "We need to get some blood work, 'k hun?" Little girly laugh after.  I haven't had blood taken since I was a lot smaller, before I was able to be stuck in the arm...and what worse, I don't take to needles more than I don't take to doctor's offices. And these people...for crying out loud...the blood room's in the basement, they already have Halloween decorations up...and they're the scariest frickin' things in the universe. And it smelled funny...much like places full of skin, blood, and piss samples will smell like.   But I have veins like tree trunks so it was all good. She stuck me with the biggest needle in the known universe, and get this: as soon as she started drawing the blood, I laughed. Sadist? I suppose. But I laughed out loud and she laughed with me, for some reason. And thusly shaken, I went to the bathroom and lo, what should be sitting there on the sink counter but a sticker! It's of a weasel, and it's from Canada! Huzzah for moi! Stickin' that sucker on the guitar as soon as I write my report here...ya know...the one for Calhoun that I never did...that's right kids! Doing it right now. I have to try and remember how many quotes per chapter, the length of the essay, and what it's even about...*cry*. But I just thought I should tell you all about my little experience and hopefully you'd all get a good laugh out of my fear of being impaled.  Bon voyage.
