See what I said about it being a bad day? Last night was so fun! Omg. Sean, Harley, Allen, Shahrom and Landon. They are so funny, and I finally got to see Sean...and I hadn't seen him since Like the 31st of last month. It was very nice to see him...Yes indeed. Landon played the bass for us and it was seriously the most amazing this ever.He is really good at it, and it was really fun to watch him play. We just wish we could have got him to sing!Landon had to leave early so it sucked. Sean and Allen left at 12:30. Sean asked for a kiss good-bye. Yeah it definetly made my night. Murray called to ask me how my fat was. And I let him know it was going great. He said I was the ugliest girl he has ever seen but that I was in luck because that person liked ugly people? Yeah it was very odd and unexpected. Kelsey and Shahrom were so cute last night. Like you have no idea. They made me want to be in love, although I do not believe in love. The camping in the tent thing was also very fun. It gets so hot in there though. But hey the Fabulous 4 don't let heat get to them. Haha...I think we are going to make a new name though. Something more unique. Like the FUCKED UP 4. haha. I wonder what's in store for today. Hmm, I hope I get to see Sean again. I think we are going to do something gay and go downtown. And Then tomorrow is the Hoop Jam for my sister and her team. I don't know if I'm going yet. But I am definetly going to the show at the Reed tomorrow. That should be really good. Anyway I am getting bored of this so I'm out. I hope you all have a wonderful day!!! I love you ALL! Well most of you.
