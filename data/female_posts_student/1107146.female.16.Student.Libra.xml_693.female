First this lady came in and was trying to find him so of course after she's gone upstairs to find him he gets into a van. I walk out there (it's dark) and I was like, Hey I think your mom is inside looking for you. He's like erm Hi...my uncle just went to go look for her, she's my aunt and I don't speak english very well. I was like hey do you speak chinese and he's says korean so 10 points for Rosie looking stupid. Oh yes...phili is still boiling.
