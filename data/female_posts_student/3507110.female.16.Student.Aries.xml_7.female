She doesn't provide much company, that one. She mostly just sits there and stares off into space. When I do try to talk to her, she just gives me this strange look. I'm starting to lose my grip on things. My perspective is being steadily warped and I'm starting to really go down. This has happened before, I go and I go until my fuel runs out and the airplane goes down. It's not really a surprise that it's starting to happen again. I suppose it's not the worst pattern. Be the Phoenix, rise from the ashes then spontaneously combust again. Sounds like a plan. Yeah, no one ever mentions the inevitable BURNING feeling associated with crashing. This unbearable slow deterioration that starts in the back of the head, like a mold, and spreads and spreads until it's all you can taste in your mouth. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is sitting back and watching it all happen and knowing that nothing short of a miracle is going to save you from yourself, from the torch. It sucks to be the bucket of gasoline when the sky rains fire. And most of the time this anger, this desire to just scream my head off, is sequestered within me because I CAN'T be mad, I CAN'T be crabby. Because I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end and I told myself a long time ago that I would never do that to anybody. Anger is bad, yelling is bad, don't yell, don't protest, just do it, don't complain. Because if you complain they'll just get angrier. And you never know when they're going to walk out the door and run right into a pole and have a freak accident. I'm sorry your mother was driving home when a fly flew through the window and obscured her vision. She drove the rest of the way home fine until she pulled into the driveway when the fly came back with a vengeance and she choked on it. Never got to say bye, I love you, Drive careful. Yeah, what irony. What makes it worse is that while you're sitting in the muddy trenches and pits of the deepest grief and sorrow, the world keeps moving, things keep growing, and everyone moves on without you. Leave me behind world, we can't both make it. Don't speak it'll only make things worse. Everything I've ever wanted to say to you is locked in my closet, perfectly accessible save for the attack kitten sitting in front of it. She loves me, that cat. We sit up and have talks every night about you, about how great you are, about how much I fucking miss you and how much I can't take life anymore. How I can't take being alone and my god I find myself shaking with pathetic emotions because you know what..It's only been a week or so since I wasn't alone. Only a week..And already I'm insane. Already I'm crying MEDICATION, HELP, THERAPY. Sam can't handle herself anymore, Better call an ambulance! Well gosh, too late. She's already bit the barrel, darn. There goes another one, they'll say, another one so full of promise and individuality. What's wrong with the kids today? Nothing, what's wrong with the adults today? Nothing, what's wrong with the world today? And the best answer to that would be nothing so people will say nothing because that's what they want to hear. Do you know what I want to hear? I want to hear your voice and your heartbeat and you. I want to hear you. But that's not going to happen is it? No, because nothing ever stays put. The world keeps turning and the scenery keeps changing and the people keep moving. They leave and you hand them your phone number and they take one look at it and laugh. I don't have time for you anymore, they say, I'm moving with the world. I don't have time to dwell here, in the place that always rains and never changes and always stays still. I'm sorry I live here but I couldn't handle the motion of the oceans and the jet stream. You move a little too quickly for Sam, I'm tired, I'm lonely, and I'm fucking pissed off. But can I do anything about it? Yes, I can save my soul.
