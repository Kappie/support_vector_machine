Like once a month.   2. What's in a typical wash load?  Usually clothes.   3. Front or top loader? Powder or liquid detergent?   I have a top loading washer.  I adore liquid detergent!   4. Do you use fabric softener in the rinse cycle?    No.  Should I?   5. Dryer or clothesline?    Dryer.  I am TOO impatient to wait for the clothes to dry on a clothes line.
