I guess today just proves that "Life isn't fair."  Everything was fine until TAPS.  I made honors of course, cause I worked my ass off for it.  And well before I went to interviews I was talking to Chels and she also made it, but she was like "Oh and I got nominated so many times for habits of mind."  You know what happened when I asked my TA: "So did any teachers nominate me for habits of mind?" and her answer was a "NO."  When that no came out of her mouth I don't think I have even gone from so happy to so sad in that many seconds.  I mean I don't understand what I did wrong!  Was it something I did, or something I didn't do?!?! I KNOW for a fact that I have worked harder that half of the people in our school.  I have gone to more tutorials than 3/4 of the student population and that I know for sure.  I know that because out of all the days of the semester there has been 10 days or less that I haven't gone to tutorial.  Now try finding in the school how many people have gone to that many tutorials.  I bet that someone couldn't even find 10 people like that.  I worked my ass off.  And the sad thing is people in my TA who come in the morning are like "Oh I didn't study, Oh I didn't finish my homework - I should umm finish it now"  and sadly alot of the time those are the people who get nominated.  Well you know what, I finish all my homework before the school day and put ALOT of effort into it.  I put in hours of studying, and I know for a fact I put in more hours than alot of other people.  It hurts alot to know that NO ONE nominated me.  It makes me feel like no one even notices me, or even cares for that matter.  I feel like I even worked way harded this year to get the marks I have gotten.  I feel like I have put EVERYTHING into school, and if people didn't nominate me 1st semester it gives me little hope for 2nd semester.  Of course not all the teachers, but I presume that most teachers only nominate the advaced, the smart, the gifted, the talented.  I feel like none of the above.  I am a hard worker but it seems there is little room left for that category.  I just don't want things to be made worse by Chels bragging tommorow about: "Oh I got nominated by so many people" - and blah, blah, blah.  Just what I need to destroy my self -esteem.  But you know after I cried about enough tears to flood my bathroom I came to realize that you know what, I KNOW in my heart, I KNOW in my mind that I really worked VERY hard and put in my 110% effort.  If people can't see that, then it's their fault.  I know that I do deserve to be nominated, but I am not, so I have to deal with it cause nothing is going to change.  What's done is done.  Only God knows why no one nominated me, literally only God knows.  I mean I am trying to not take this so badly, but I didn't think not getting nominated would upset me this badly -but I knew I wanted it very badly.  Ever since I learned that you can be nominated for habits of mind I have purposly worked harder and tried by very best.  If that is not good enough then I don't know what is.  I feel really bad, but not as bad as before, and definetly not as upset as before.  It would of made me happy if at least one person nominated me, but like I said "Life just isn't fair sometimes."  And right now it isn't fair because I know what I deserve.
