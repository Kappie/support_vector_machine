Actually, not life, persay, just my laziness and general lack of any motivation right now.  There're only three more days (alas!) of school, 6 more exams, 12 more hours.  Then I'm freeee for the summer!  How blissfully wonderful.  A very interesting thought crossed my mind today.  How do you know when you've STOPPED liking someone?  I mean, it'd be nice if your hormones just popped up in front of your face one day and said, "Hey!  Look!  Your body's stopped producing these hormones.  You can resume your everyday, normal life now.  Sorry for the interruption."  But of course, no, nature isn't so kind.  Not that I've stopped liking him, really.  Just... I want to.  Because truthfully, he drives me bonkers.  That attitude, and that stupid voice, and that SMELL.  I can't get his smell out of my head.  I wonder about smells.  It's amazing how a smell can just stick in your head for the longest time.  It's like... it gets lodged there.  I can recognize things by their smell before anything else.  For example, there is this particular smell in the fall that just reminds me of my grandmother.  In first grade, she used to go to the bus stop with me, and the day smelled like that.  So now I connect that smell to that memory.  Memories have smells.  Isn't that interesting?  I want to be able to write.  Not write inanely, but write with a purpose.  The maximum meaning for the minimum number of words.  I could never do that, though.  I'm not talented enough.  And I'm not patient enough to sit down and start writing and writing and writing to try to get my writing that way.  I'm too impulsive, I guess.  I wonder that I can draw at all.  Maybe that's why my art projects are always so crappy.  I never take any time on them.  I just sit down and draw the fastest thing I can.  Then I turn it in and hope that my test grades will make up for those crappy project grades.  Then I go to class and I see Esther's projects and Melanie's projects and Louisa's projects and I feel so inferior.  I want to be able to sign someone yearbook in SUCH an awesome way that it'll be remembered for years and years.  I have to wait until next year, though, I guess.  There are only so many things you can do to those little in-between spaces.  I hate people who sign yearbooks with a message just long enough to take up the page but not long enough to fill up the page.  It pisses me off beyond all reason.  And now I should be studying for my commapps exam and my english exam, but alas, once again, my laziness will do me in.  My laziness ought to go hang.  So I will think happier thoughts.  Like how I will be going to China in nine days and leave Texas for a blissful four weeks.  That means no Jack or Chuan or Grace or Lisa or Alice or anyone.  Just Kerry and Eileen in Nanjing with me.  I'll be able to speak Chinese and walk around the city with no adults and when I get hungry, I'll just look to the right and look to the left and choose a food vendor from one of my sides.  And I'll get a yummy bread roll or dumpling for just a yuan or something.  And I can spend my entire day on the streets looking for cheap art supplies or pretty paper or Chinese books or calendars.  Just three more days.  Three more.  Kailing, do you want to see Mean Girls on Friday with me?  I don't know how we'll get there, but I'm sure we'll think of something.  =)
