Then we could be sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still observe the wild beyond if we so desire.  I guess cubing would still work, even if its stormy.  Then it will just be extra slick, like a well used whore (mu-hu!) Anyways, we were going to try wetting it down before hand anyways so the first few rides aren't so bumpy (If you read that and take out all the refrences to cubing, it sounds kinda..ah..perverted)  Also, if we still do the picnic, what will we consume?  I'd suggested thoes pre-baked chickens that grocery stores sell, but it seems that Jason does not like them (and we can't have Jason not liking something) so we came up with sandwich supplies (you know, lunch meat, bread, condiments) and then you can just make it how you like.  We could also get chips and dips and veggies and fruits and cat litter.  Oh, did I say that?  Opps.  And finally, did anyone see Marissa Cool today?  Namely her tight pink shirt which she was not wearing a bra under?  Her nipples were really hard and it was really gross and her and Tracy were talking about it all period.  Also, Marissa and Lauryn Livengood are trying out for badminton.  Tracy mentioned that she might try out too.  GOD HELP US ALL
