So tonight, I watched the Simpsons, but one thing that made me :-( he havent call me.   Actually, I still need to work hard, two more examinations on next week then will my winter holiday. :-)  又過了一個星期，今個星期只是不停地讀書、讀書再讀書。我真的好想快點過完這個溫習週。好討厭考試。所以今晚我放鬆一下，睇了一陣Simpsons，但有一樣野係他另我 :-( 就係佢無打俾我。  但是我都會繼續努力，還有兩科考試便放我的冬假。:-)
