MP and her man were there, as was my good friend KH and his friend. The BF came by after work, and of course my work crew was there, some working, some not. i might have paid for two drinks all night, and i think they were the BF's. my friends bought me a drink or two each, the bartender (MS!) bought me a few. my work friends kept buying me shots, and the regulars who were out on the patio got me a few rounds. the interesting part was that i think i was the least drunk at the end of the night, with possibly the exception of A? who just got off of work. one friend in particular, who said she wasnt going to drink much, (you know who you are!) decided at one point that she would be responsible for birthday spanking. although i had vetoed this idea earlier in the night, she ignored me and, damn she hits hard! its ok i teased her mercilessly the next day. at least no one sang. happy birthday that is, BF did a karaoke rendition of a guns-n-roses tune. it wasnt karaoke night, but that didnt seem to bother anyone. i lost some pool games, as usual, and smoked more cigarettes then i thought possible. we left before last call, (we have  some  dignity!) and met up at my place where the party continued, for  some  of us, ahem. then i kicked everbody out because i didnt want to embarrass myself further by falling over.  it wasnt a big bash or anything, but it was cool to hang out with all my (texas) friends in one day. CM in cali sent me a cute ecard, (who i have yet to email, sorry CM! i promise to get in touch soon)as did my mom who also donated funding to the broke "incognito" fund (thanks mom!!!) to those of you that forgot, its ok i probably forget yours too.
