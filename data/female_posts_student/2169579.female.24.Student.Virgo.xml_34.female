'course now i have to suck it up and study, but that's okay, 'cause i kick ass no matter what i'm doin!!!  once i was on my knees, waiting, forever waiting no more, i am up and running, not in circles, not in fear not from pain... i am running with my friends, i am running in  the present... right now i am here, not behind, nor infront... here, here to stay!!!
