No, Because i Wouldnt want anyone to track me down where ever i am..that would be wierd, especially if i can just have a credit card in my arms, no use of wallets! i don't want that to happen cause i like wallets and i don't want anybody to track me down! It'll be a dumb idea! But for criminals it'll be a great idea!  2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this? Hmmp..I don'T tHink so...i thINk credit cards are alright right now.  4.
