The holidays are coming up in a few days and i have know idea what i'm gonna do, i'm just going to let the 'surf take me to my destiny'. Also i have my 'Work To  School' conference tomorrow and Friday, which (from what i have heard from my 'lushtons' in year 11) is going to be quite fun! (not just because i'm going to see all my fit guy-mates in suits! lol) xxx
