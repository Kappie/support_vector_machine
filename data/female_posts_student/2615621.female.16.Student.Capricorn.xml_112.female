UGH i did like 200 of them this morning and 300 yesterday, so far i have 500 done...outta 1000. WOW! lol i still have 500 to go!! well, 400some, cuz i almost have another 100 done. I'll be glad when im done because then i'll get paid. My dad wants me to be done with them tonite. DUDE! he means by 6pm that is. right now here, its a quarter til 1. I know i can do it..but u know, i have other things to do! no one is online to talk to..but i did want to put some of my tanner stuff on. The weather is taking a turn for the worse and the sun isnt staying out and its suppose to rain all weekend. sound fun? well sounds like my bragging about pretty weather caught with me...haha Its beautiful weather, if ur a frog. But anyways, back to the tanner. My cousin kaye told my dad before i wore my skirt that i needed some color on me and i cant wear hose with the shoes im wearing...ugh. lol yeah, my legs are white, and yeah they sometimes get color on them when i go outside, but it doesnt last long. SOOOOO kaye told my dad to buy me sunless tanner. and what did we do at walmart last nite after watching some oldie singer preform (kim carnes or something) we bought sunless tanner. UGH haha i mean, ive tried to use it before, and it never works on me right, so im dreading having to put it on cuz i know it will just mess up! and u know what, im wearing sandels, so that means i gotta do my ankle (UGH) and feet (UGH) so no fake ass tan lines. but hey, at least its fake. i much rather go get airbrushed though. that might be fun...lol at least it would look right. i'll try my best! i got the Bulid A Tan, the lightest thing, so u can go back and put more on to make it darker. so it should be idiot proof...just maybe.   I had the weirdest dream last nite. I was with a lot of people, including my dad, and it felt like family. and we were in this big nice restraunt, and we were all looking at what to order and my grandfather told me to order this soup, and u know clover when it gets those purple blossoms? well it was a soup with those things in it!! i mean, it was like flower soup. So i told him i didnt like flower soup and he made me taste it, and i remember it being good, but i still didnt want to eat flowers. So then i got a salad and my dad got BBQ. WELL...they brought him this plate, and it had a mini cow on it. i mean, seriously..a mini live cow. Now, this cow was so cute. It looked like a baby kitten, it was that size, like u could just pick it up and hold it. It looked so innocent. It sat on his plate just looking around and i was like..aww a baby cow!! WELL, my dad picks up his knife, and the idea is to chop off the cows head and then that kills it and u can eat it. ...all i could think of was eating that thing after it was dead and seeing its udders.. haha i know that sounds funny. well he takes his knife and starts to cut its head off and i put my hands over my ears cuz i dont wanna hear it if it makes any noises and i cover my face in the womans sholder beside me. I'm screaming and im ilke NOOO DONT HURT THE LITTLE COW PLEASE DADDY!! and i look and hes sawing away on its head, and i coud see bone, and the whole thing. it was very realistic, execpt for the size of the lil cow. and i turn back away and im like NOOO PLEASE. and then finally, i look over and its layin lifeless with its head to one side and my dad is like "now time to eat!".   It was weird. But its so true. We kill cows (i dont know how..maybe we do cut their heads off..) everyday and its no big deal, and there are people who are screaming NOO DONT KILL THE COW!!! and theres the people like "yay ready to eat!!"...idk...i still like meat, but it was a wild dream. Maybe i should become a veggie. naw..anyways, maybe i dreamed it cuz last nite we were talkin about how we're going to the Slick Pig, for BBQ tonite for dinner. lol idk...but it was CRAZY. There ya go lauren..one of my weird dreams!!   Well, gotta get back to work!! *much love*
