HEY, WE HAVE A NEW TRADITION!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay, so yeah, lemme explain - thursday night, it was me, billy, carlie, and jason in the target parking lot. and there was this random cone over by the starbucks. so we took it, and it's at my house right now. i named him Bucks. but yeah, so our idea that we made for a tradition was to bring Bucks with us wherever we go, and leave it at someone else's house each time. or like randomly drive to someone's house and leave Bucks there. so yeah. whadduya think???  and also, i have something for us to do. for the play, we need a lot of rocks, so we could go rock-hunting one night, or whatever. i wouldn't be able to go tonight, 'cuz i have to be in bed early for field hockey tomorrow. but yeah, rock-hunting. whatevers.   keep on keepin'.
