YES, the world is a fucked up place. no matter what. b.c. ppl are in it. other people always manage to screw everything else up. and them us ourselves. mess up the remaining bits and peices that are left to our own demise. you said the rest of us our in...and your not. as far as guys are concerned, i am FAR from "in". its a vicious cycle. b.c. i'm not myself around guys. i see what others girls have done and immatate them, i act flirty and maybe outgoing and loud, but not my natural self. i act like that when i want ppl to see me. but true to myself, i dont want to be seen. so its stupid. and it is fake infact. i very rarely open up to anyone. and thats the way it is. i have freinds. i have only a pocket full of the friends that i can say anything to. and say what i really think. but i want it that way. b.c. then you have too many ppl involved, theres no doubt some concealing. and some secrets. so whats the point.  anyhou. off topic.
