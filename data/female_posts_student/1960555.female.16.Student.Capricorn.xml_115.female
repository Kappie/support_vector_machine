Aiden's his name. and he shared his clothes pins with me... i don't know why.... but he did! and i hung out with Dave and Robyn (Aiden's parents, aka my cousins) and all was fun and well. then we went to Regina for my other cousin's wedding. Elise, she married Jarred. it was fun, and i had a good time, especially the next morning when i found out that the girl who was hitting on the guy who i'd become infatuated with at the reception, had gotten alky poisoning and had to get her stomach pumped. hahaha, well she deserved it. she was mean to me! anyways... then i got my hair cut in regina (so yes, i now have a saskatchewan stylist) and i saw Ferinheit 9/11 with my parents.i now think that bush is an even bigger prat than i didbefore. really...how few brain cells do you have to have before you are concidered clinicly retarded. he's a moron, mentally ill moron. i think prat really sums it up. then i sawThe Calendar Girls with my A. Sheila. it's the funniest movie. i cried (cause it was sad) then icried (cause i was laughing sohard). good movie. anyway, all in all it was a goodtime. oh and i am nowa part of the olsen clan. i was adopted by both of my dad's cousins (brian and bert).brian hasjoint custody of me in the summer. it all came aboutwhen mum decided that i needed an older brother. so brian offered me dave (his son). then before i know it, theircomingup to me at the reception telling me all this. hahaha iwas in complete shock...i honestly don't think they'd even started drinking yet. itwasquite funny. then they told Dave and helooked just as concerned as idid.but none the less, i have a cousin/brother. it's great. (Crash,welcomeme to the cousin/brother club). then my cousin's (lori's) husband Robby ordered Shark Steak at dinner and i was so in shock by it. itlooks like chicken, tastes like chicked (he gave me a bite so i'dbelieve him),but it's shark! i was freakingmesmerised. oh yea, then we went to the stampeed. yay! i love thestampeed. thegreatest outdoor show on earth. woot.then my aunt banned me from dating a cowboy. "He'll break your heart!cowboys are like that." Pfff, half my cousins are cowboys! their nice enought. gawd she's sodramatic. anyawy. i got a cowboy hat. it's black.it's no stetson, but it'lldo. it was a giftfrom my aunt carol's husband Sonny, so i'm not complaining. oh, and ifany of you have a GPS, i will end it's life if youso much as mention it. i hate those things! oh and i want tobe rich. iam in love with the Hotel Saskatchewan Raddison. it's so nice. and did i mention.... ZZ freaking Top was myneighbour. yea. no joke. hewas on his way to Craven. i nearly wet myself. hehehe. oh god. hahaha, sharp dressed man. i was singing that all weekend. goooood times. what else what else what else..... oh, i think i'm going to try and go to university ineither Regina or Calgary. i'd have a place to stayin either city (with myadopted Olsenfamily) and i like those citiesbetter than victoria or vancouver. but alas, it is two more years. plenty of time to change my mind!
