Christina cancelled her tour due to overused vocal chords....   ***By the way I WANT THE GREY ALBUM!!! CAN ANYONE GET IT FOR ME????***  iTunes is talking about digitizing out of print music from old records... that is a huge feat and one that would keep Apple sitting on top of all the music downloading franchises out there.  I don't want to talk about Michael Jackson anymore....   I am so buying one of these:  The technology is quite simple: The music fan goes up to the touch-screen kiosk after the show and buys the keychain drive with a credit card from a dispenser alongside the screen. Once that's done, the miniature drive is inserted into a slot in the kiosk, and the recording - stored as MP3 files - is loaded onto the device's 128-megabyte hard drive. That is enough space for 110 minutes of music.
