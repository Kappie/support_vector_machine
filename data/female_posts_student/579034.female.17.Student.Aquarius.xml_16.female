We has so much fun and talked about everythng. And, yea, Melly, Tom looked hot. We talked about like everything, like, carnival games that involve hammers for instance (lol). Then, I went to track. It was okay I guess. Then I got home and Greg came over around 8. We had fun. Watched South Park. It was the one where Stan, Kyle, and Cartman's parents send them to Kenny's house to get the chicken poks (sp?). Then we hung out and chilled and he left at 11:30. Now, I'm mad bored, not tired, and talkin to Mickey cause he's cool and he's up. Hee hee. Tomorrow, I need to go and get an outfit for Melissa's sweet 16. Can't wait for that cause I havent seen her or anyone else really all summer! Okay, I'm out, peace xox
