She was kinda having fights with her parents so she came over to sort it out and also hang out avec moi!  We made some really really interesting jokes.....but it was amusing.  Another update in sports!  Coppell Hockey beats Duncanville 5-0.  OMG the Duncanville moms were frickin crazy!!!!!  They were like screaming everytime one of the Duncanville players got within 3 ft of the puck!!!!  Psycho hockey moms, very scary.  Coppell could've played better though, i was kind of dissappointed in them.  Duncanville's defense was really solid though, but their goalie sucked so it didn't do them much good.  Duncanville had some hot guys on their team too!  Of course that was on Thursday while there was also a Stars game going on which i believe we won 2-1......Ilya Kovalchuk was scaring the hell out of me because i thought he was going to tie it up any second.  Stars did pretty good in that game.  I also went to the Stars game today against Colorado at freaking NOON!!!  No one plays hockey at noon!!!  I don't even get up at that hour!  Anyways, i went and the stars kinda sucked the first 2 period of the game and we scored a goal that got taken away for 'Goalie Interference".....which was SO NOT!!!  The goalie got himself tied up with his own players and one of ours and then Guerin went around and scored and then they didn't count it and put him int he box for Goalie Interference.  I'm sorry, but it is not our fault that the Colorado goalie is that stupid to get himself tied up with his own players plus one of the Stars.  So yeah.....the refs officially made it onto my hit list at that moment.  I felt so much extreme hate for them at that moment, it wasn't even funny.  Oh but it gets worse my friends.  Then they started calling penalties on people WHO WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE TO THE PERSON THEY SUPPOSEDLY DID SOMETHING TO!!!  They called one for just skating by one of those Colorado people it seemed like.  It was terrible, i wonder how much the refs were paid.  They kept on calling slashing when nothing happened.  I think the Stars are lucky though that Teemu Selanne was hurt and didn't come back after second period.....he would've scored some serious goals with Milan Hejduk, Peter Forsberg, Tanguay and Paul Kariya (my personal fave Av, I couldn't like him last year because he played for Anaheim and me and Britty were boycotting Anaheim/Disney during playoffs).  But in the 3rd period i think we finally decided to get our asses in gear and we scored 2 goals.  So we didn't go down without a fight.  OMG but Tippett pulled Turco with 2 mins and 30 secs left!!!  Me, Emily and Lauren (the girls that are my friends that sit next to us) were freaking out like "What the hell are you doing!!! You're not supposed to do that until the final minute!!!".   I swear those 2 shots at the goal when Turco wasn't there......Miracles of God.......The first one was a little bit of a long shot but it got close.  The second one though.....omg.......it was going straight for the middle of the back of the net.....and then all of the sudden it did this little movement where it decided to go left.......and it missed the goal by literally AN INCH.  It was absolutely nerve-racking.  Me and Emily started freaking out and hugging because God had just saved the Stars from an even more embarassing loss.  If you saw on the TV or live......you will agree that it was a Miracle of God.  Anyways, we still lost and there were alot of penalties that should've been called on Colorado but never got called.  Stupid refs.....reminds me of the Coppell vs. Southlake Carroll game in Frisco this year.  That reminds me, Southlake Carroll has lost THREE TIMES this season so far....they must've lost alot of awesome players last year due to graduation etc.  Last year they were undefeated until they lost to Clear Lake in Semifinals for State which completely sucked for them but was good for us.   Omg at the stars game also, there were these stupid guys that sat in front of us and made fun of me, Emily and Lauren and their friends that were with them.  Lauren spazzed on them by asking if they were Stars fans and then when they didn't answer she was like "Yeah thats what i thought".  They were so ugly too!  They were slightly overweight and completely undeniably american.....and painfully ignorant of hockey.  I finally was like "Hey! Shut the Hell up or go home!" and then i wanted to whisper under my breath "Go eat some nachos or something...overweight bastards" but then the Stars scored so i was distracted.  Sorry, i know but i was really mad.  Emily thought it was really really funny.  They were saying they were going to "beat the fucking shit" out of us anyways so we did have to kinda defend ourselves.  Emily was all like "Jerkoffs, don't come to the games anymore.  We didn't come here to listen to you mock everyone".  Yeah....i almost hope they come back so i can yell at them and stuff.  Thats all i got, bye now!  Much Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S - Niko rocked at the stars game today, yaaay!  And he was on the cover of the program thing!  Hurrah!
