We spent 10 minutes talking about AS/2, how my GCSEs are doing, which subjects need what doing to them and then we spent the other 10 minutes talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department. I think I might just write "Jesus" 400 times on the exam and see what happens.
