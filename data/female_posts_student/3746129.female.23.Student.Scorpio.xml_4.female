Cries can be heard above the roar of the fire, Songs and chants honouring the spirits of the dead And blessing the souls of the living. Timeless traditions, spanning generations Keep the old ways alive. Keepers of the wild, Mother Nature and animals are brethren Revered among the elders of the tribe. Native to this land, their lineage surpasses that of the white man. No longer allowed to roam free in the wilderness they command. Their skin is no longer reminiscent of the Red people of old. Their sun hardened leather skin has softened and lightened.   Languages once spoken to differentiate the many tribes, Are now whispers. No longer a dominant force in trade, The natives are slowly being allowed to gain back What they have lost over the centuries, honour and pride. Once valiant warriors they now fight to save The various species they endangered. Their blood has been spilt for centuries upon their own soil, As they fight for survival against foreign enemies and themselves. Peaceful by nature, they honour the spirits of the dead, Both human and animal. Shaman’s is what they were in the past. Healer’s and doctor’s, healing both the wounded and the land. Their natural approach to medicine is no longer standard practice. They are sought out in times of great need, When western medicine has failed. Their wisdom surpasses that of the worldliest scholar; For knowledge of the earth is the most sacred knowledge of all. Understanding that we are all apart of a great cycle of life, Helps one to understand the native way of thought, Life and death are great rights of passage. For each new life created, one old life must be ended. In death comes re-birth. In what form you are re-born is for the Gods to decide. Ageless shadows dance across the horizon, Images of the people that were here long before the white man, And will be here long after. Native to this land, they command the wild And belong to the earth.
