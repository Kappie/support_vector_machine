(did i mention i finally named the pets...well there they are...) my tummy is grumbly. grumbly in my tumbly. and i don't know where my advisor person is. but i must be fed and i'm stuck here until she gets here. yesterday all the non graduate student ppl had lunch with the chairman/vice president guy.  and everything he said was completely contradictory to what the other dude said. mahfuz is all "be formal" and "memorize these equations" and shit. and jeelani is like "your report can be on 5 new words you learned" wtf? these ppl drive me crazy man. though yesterday's lunch wasa bit reassuring. he also said that no one would be asking me any questions. buti fear dr. mahfuz. he's a tricky one. and it's really weird considering he's been a friend of the family forever and all. and he's such a tiny man. who would ever be afraid of me. but at the same time i'm scared to like make him mad. -_-; *indian accent* what to do? oh great. those guys are rubbing off on me. yes my sad existence here also means that i am stuck with only biswas and jeelani jr to keep me company. yea yea there are the graduates and all, but....haha yeah. and there's that mosi kid too. but he's not here half the time. now where are those ppl? i am hungry... oh yes. and zach's having a thing at his house today. and i really want to go. but the chances of my making it seem slim. the thing starts at 5, i might not even get off until after. cause my dad is working late. thursday and all. *sigh*  that's sad. and nadia and jordan might not go. and b/c i'm my sad and pathetic self it sucks.  *is rideless* ok that's enough whining for now. i'm hungry and i'm going to take some drastic measures to change this situation.
