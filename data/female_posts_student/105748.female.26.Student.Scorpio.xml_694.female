Some say to wait it out when they regroup and up and running by the end of August and some say to take the money and run with another server.  This is the first I have heard of a server going down for such a long period without major notification and no direct re-startup date.  It sounds very fishy.  Speaking of fish, I think its time to dip the pole in the Long Island Sound.  A couple of co-workers and I will fish after work.  Hmmm. I might have to borrow Tonino's fish rods. Mine is MIA.  I dont remember taking it with me when I left Manhattan.      More to come...  NET
