And we stayed up until 3:30 watching at least 6 episodes of Friends (because she has the first and second season on DVD) and then Pirates of the Carribbean.  We missed the hockey game that night but its ok because the Stars won anyways 2-1 over Nashville.  Anyways, we decided to try and sleep.  Well, the ENTIRE NIGHT it sounded like someone was tapping on Jess' window.  So we were getting all scared and we didn't really fall asleep until 4:30 AM.  I don't know how i made it through today because i didn't have any caffeine ALL DAY!!  Which is like a record for me.  On the other hand, Jess drank like 5 Pepsi's seriously and we ate almost an entire bag of chips and container of salsa......all while watching Friends.  I stayed at her house until about 4:30pm watching Friends and talking.  It was depressing.  Me and Jess discovered that we have more in common with the guy characters of Friends than we do with the girl characters.  Scary.  I hope we don't end up like we did today when we're 30 or something.  So nothing really happened today, Brittany gets back from Boston today AND the Stars play Columbus tonight.  I swear, if the Stars don't beat Columbus.....ack i don't even want to think about it. Ttyl  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
