But hey, Laura? You've got some damn freaky presents! Ha! Sucker! (Geez if I get freaky stuff for Laura then what will she get me...?) Scary! :'( I'm wearing shorts! I looked like such a idiot walking through Nailsea with shorts on, but my mum told me it would be warm! Last time I trust my mum's weather advice! I'm gonna go soak in some lard now bubi.
