(it sounds like I'm describing a pie, mmm pie...)  Anyway...if only it was a thursady instead of a friday, maybe then we'd have a snow day or something.  But alas, it is too much to dream for!    Well off I go, and to study for the IIs.  Maybe if i repeat that enough times to myself, I might actually do it!  And to Summer, if you survive the snow, give us a sign!
