I REALLY REALLY WANTED TO GO.  so I got my borother to take me so it was all good. (I had to do 3 hours of work for him tomorrow but it was all goood..)  SO it was all figured out so I could go. Then my stupid mom is all like "You can't go because  i want you to go to church.  So I was like...I know, I am going to church.. and she was like you still can't go.  WHY NOTTTTT    "Because it doesn't work with my schedule."   What?!?!?! Of course it works with your schedule! MATT is doing all the driving and everything.  I was so mad.  I yeleld my head off. I have never yelled at my mom.  UGH   SO then I went to my room and just cried. It was a STUPID DAY
