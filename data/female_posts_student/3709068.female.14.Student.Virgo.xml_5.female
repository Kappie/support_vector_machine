BUT I AM STILL HAPPY!!!!  This shall be my Vincent Valentine shrine of    Why I love Vincent Valentine:  1. His sad, sad story: for some reason I like men with traumatic pasts. Like Heero. Vincent's story is so sad. And he really needs a girlfriend. 2. His mean cruel attitude: He's so cold. ^_^ Just like me sometimes...  3. His philosophical ways: HIS QUOTES ARE SO TRUE!! Even if most of the time they aren't exactly ...postive. well okay most of them are downright depressing, buuuuuuut..... 4. He's not human: I don't like humans. Period. And technically, he's not human, he's an expirimental mutant. 5. His general prettiness: Let's face it. He is damn sexy. WHOOOO!  well, this was short as far as my blogs go but that's cuz I didn't have much to talk about. Oh well...^ ^;;
