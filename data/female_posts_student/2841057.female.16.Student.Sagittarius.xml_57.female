'hay nako.. utang na loob ko pa... anyway' hehe... We went to a mall and had some donuts instead of a cup of coffee because our favorite cafe dont have a branch on that mall. hehe... Well then, of course, what we did is the usual-window-shop-for-future-shopping routine. Then, she left cause she need to meet someone and I decided to stay at the mall. I looked for the book "Who Moved My Cheese? by Stephen Johnson" at the National Bookstore. We need it due to our book report which we have to submit few weeks from now. Gosh! It's so expensive, though it seems that its price doesn't worth it, maybe because it's a bestseller and the author. Hmmm... anyway.. well then... I went home without any book purchased. Hehe...
