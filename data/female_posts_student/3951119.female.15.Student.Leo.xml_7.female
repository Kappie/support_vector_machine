Ally loved Arik, Arik loved Ally, Arik was killed, Ally was sad, hence this poem.  *tear for lost love*   Black be the heavens and dead be the sun, the light of the stars - extinguished. The entire world comes undone, my love is gone - forever more. And no words and no tears can ever soothe my soul, for the only one I've held dear is six feet down and cold. A simple stone marks his life, a name, two dates, some poetry. And flowers lay upon his grave, roses red for my love for he. Dark be moon and life be gone, truth is jaded, faded, false. Crushed be my heart, and broken in two, my love, my love, return to me! No words nor tears can heal my heart, no blood nor song can mend this tear.
