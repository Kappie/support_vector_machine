Oh well... it's all getting paid to me.  Today I have a training session about brain development from 2-5.  Oh what fun!  3 hours of BRAIN DEVELOPMENT!  But, at least Greg will be there to keep me company and make me laugh... he's funny.  I was telling him about Camp Hacknslash... he was like, "Why didn't you tell me?!  I would've gone!"  haha  Let's see... how can I describe everyone else?  Heather... she's a control freak, and she's very blunt and rude to even her friends... sorta reminds me of Jennifer... her bluntness that is.  Then there's Kristen... Kristen is very quiet and reserved to peoples' faces.  When they leave the room she vents about them... and by them I mean Heather... and by vent, I mean VENT about the blunt meanness that Heather always throws towards Kristen.  I feel sorry for Kristen, because she is sharing an apartment with Heather.  I'm sure I'll get to hear lots of stuff throughout the year from Kristen.  I don't (currently) know anyone else that's working at my site, but I'll meet them soon, hopefully.  I hope that Nick is at the session today, too... because he makes me laugh too... and with a boring topic like brain development, I'll need all the humor I can take.  Plus, I just like seeing Nick... he's cute and fun to flirt with.  Just my luck he has a girlfriend.  ; )
