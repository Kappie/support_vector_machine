I am finally admitted to Livejournal! YES! But that means I have to update both journals. But Blogger will be my first piority. LJ is too complicated and tedious. I think I need at least half a year to sort out my template and fonts (it is still in Times New Roman, Man, I hate that font). Plus LJ is so 'ma fan', must do this, do that, to impress people so that you are accepted as a friend. But why I still join even I know it is so troublesome? Easy. The simple reason is that it is FUN! But as I say, Blogger is still my first and foremost....  P.S By the way, have you notice that my blog is just too PINK? I also noticed it, scrollbar, the background, EVERYTHING! But please try to be patient with me, ok? Especially the male species out there.... *hehe*
