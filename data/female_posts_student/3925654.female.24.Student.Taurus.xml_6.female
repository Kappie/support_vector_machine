Scott Rolen became Scott Rolen  Rollin' Rollin'  and I even invented a code for what happened in the ever-so-entertaining eighth inning: UHMP (OUCH), which stands for "Ump Hit in Man Region (OUCH)."  And I'm sticking to my theory that Zambrano intentionally hitJim Edmonds a second time so that he could leave the game. The ump barely had his thumb up in the air by the timeZambrano had left the mound.    All that and a bench-clearing brawl (well, without the brawl) makes for a good time at the ballpark as I see it. I think I could get used to this whole baseball thing. Too bad I have to wait until next Monday to see the Cubs again live (though thenwe'll be at Miller Park).
