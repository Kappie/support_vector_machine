First off, it's very subtle, Just one banner ad at the top and an indulgent 'i power blogger' button on the side.  The 'i power blogger' think kinda rocks, cause it makes it seem like ONLY i power blogger, like i'm some sort of mastermind.  The banner ad is even cool, and i'm constantly clicking on it, cause its so specific to my blog entries.  For example, when my ben folds, rufus wainwright, and guster concert post was the most recent, the ad was for ben folds sheet music and rufus wainwright concert tickets.  When the harry potter post was the most recent, it was all about mugglenet.com and harry potter costumes.  very classy.  anyway, that concludes my little suck-up rant.  Wednesday and Thursday were soooo long.  My cousin alisa had a doctors appointment, and she left her two kids, pheobe and shjon (pronounced "shawn") to be watched by my sister and i.  Now, my parents were both working, and my sister can't drive, so we were stuck in the house with two insane babies (3 and 5).    Now, Shjon is hilarious and full of energy, but the child can not keep himself entertained for three minutes.  he'll pick a movie like the jungle book (whose name i didn't get until like, last year btw) watch it for ten minutes (not quietly, but punching things and acting like a monkey) and then get bored of it and turn it off.  Or even better, he'll LIE to turn it off.  We were watching Road to El Dorado (ooh, kevin cline and kenneth branagh singing!!) and halfway through he claims that his parents have FORBIDDEN him and pheobe from watching it.  He claimed that it was too scary for pheobe, and we would be in trouble for showing it to them.  Now, i know alisa, katie knows alisa, and she and her husband would never forbid their kids from watching a movie, he was just bored.  The best part about shjon is the way he acts with daniel.  When daniel was a young tot, he would bother my cousin's endlessly,  Chasing them around, making them play stupid games, generally being as annoying as possible to everyone (the latter of which he still hasn't shaken...).  So knowing this, its hilarious to see shjon acting EXACTLY the same.  Daniel was being a crank the whole day, requiring 'a bubble' and requesting that shjon let him have his 'me' time (which i call his 'drama king' time).   We told him to take his medicine and like it.  Then there's pheobe.  She is possibly the cutest child i have ever seen, and i'm not only saying that because everyone says she's me reincarnated.  She looks so sweet and cute, but underneath, she's a pezzanovante.  At least five times she threatened to backhand me, all the time saying "Straight to the moon, alice.  STRAIGHT TO THE MOON!!".    ah, they are cute, especially when they are looked at in retrospect.  However, after two days and two hours of sleep, me and katie were getting run down.  We could probably have handled it better if we hadn't given them such high standards of what to expect at our house.  Everytime that they come over, we always do something special, like buy them new clothes or walk to the playground or have a picnic.  Well, since thats all that we do with them, they aren't content to just sit down and watch t.v.  Now, i guess that curiosity and imagination are good things to culture in a kid, but they are not good things if you want to take a nap.  All in all, i was glad when the days were over.  Oh right, and thursday night, after they left, i went to night frisbee.  It sucked for the most part, because the hoodlums and bopp ditched us at the begining to go 'to a party'.  I think it might have been cause i was there.  Anyway, we tossed the disc for a couple minutes until my mom came.  When i went home, i found that 'go to a party' meant 'hang around in jess's culdesac which also happens to be mike burkes culdesac and play friz there instead of with the dorks at the y field'  My mom saw them there and very fittingly said 'fuckers' before pulling in the driveway.  see ya on the flip  jess  p.s.  post some comments, it boosts my self esteem  oh, also, visit Bowyer's blog and Moira's Blog (links located on right) because i remember how hard it was to build visitors.  Blogs are wonderful things, and it would be a shame if two people as funny and creative as moira and bowyer gave up their blogs because they didn't think they were making a difference.  My final thought, all of you who read this should start a blog.  it is a fantastic way to vent, and teaches you valuable lessons in procrastination.  Also, if you DO start one, i'll link to you on my site, and i promise to read every single post.  WOW!! it's 12:34!!  thats a sign for me to sign off  once again  Jess
