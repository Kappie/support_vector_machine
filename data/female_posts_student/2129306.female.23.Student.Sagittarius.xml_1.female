I think that I can safely say that I won't be having any more dinner parties w/ the Chambanaites anytime soon, at least not ones that include the company of Dan, Joe, and Donald TOGETHER-when they are by themselves, they're fine, but the three of them TOGETHER have proven to be more than I could take.   For the dinner party, I cooked a lovely dinner for everyone, chicken Parmesan, garlic bread, Caesar salad, tiramisu, red wine-and it turned out fabulous, I think it was well received. Things actually seemed mature and dignified for awhile, but it wasn't meant to last-I mean, who are we dealing w/, after all?  Things went downhill as soon as the greygoose and absolut made their appearances.  Those, in addition to Dan and Joe's gift of Franiza boxed wine-the consumption of these beverages made the evening one of the most hilarious, infuriating, and memorable ones that you could probably ever imagine.  After sitting around my kitchen table and trying to prevent the boys from lighting napkins on fire, (candles=BAD IDEA!) the boys decided my living room was quite boring and needed decoration-if that's what you would call it.    My living room, for one brief shining moment on the evening of January 9th, was turned into a fort.  The destructive forces I like to call Dan, Joe, and Donald proceeded to take the furniture in my spotlessly clean apt., and construct an elaborate fort that they claimed would protect me and my roommates from the pedofiles and rapists of the world (in addition to dirty UIS boys).  But, the fort wasn't enough, apparently.  When my roommate Heidi, Joe, Meghann, and I decided to go on a run for more, er, beverages, I made the mistake of letting Dan, Donald, and Diller behind-a group that I'll now refer to as the Triple-D Destructive forces.  Anyway, when we returned, I was mildly alarmed to find the lights in my apt out, but assumed it was just the boys goofing off.    Goofing off is far to tame of a term to use when it comes to describing just WHAT they did to my place.  If I hadn't found it just so ingenious and demented and hilarious, I swear I would have killed them.  They had RAIDED my coat closet and decorated the entire apt. with toilet paper-we're talking hanging from ceiling fans, strewn on the floor-everywhere.  Dan and Donald were seated underneath the fort and were waving coat hangers in the air, while Diller pretended to be passed out/dead in one of the chairs.  (They told me later that they had wanted to put ketchup on him to give it the aura of a horror movie, but had decided to draw the line-WISE decision) They had also dragged out my vacuum and turned it on full blast to add to the weirdness and hysteria.  Finally, they had taken pages from my roommate Liz's flip chart and decorated the upstairs balcony.  If it had not been there, right in front of my eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.  The worst part was, as mad as I was at them for destroying my apt., I couldn't help but laugh because GOOD GRIEF-I mean, they built a fort.  If you don't believe me, I recommend to track down Joe Worobey and have him show you the pictures he took, (tragically, my disposable camera was lost in the shuffle) because that's really the only way you'll believe it.    So after the excitement of the fort, and the initial humor, I proceeded to become pissed that the kiddies had wrecked the apt.  Snaps go to my new roommate Heidi, who JUST moved in yesterday, and the fact that she didn't even know me well, and didn't know my friends, and she was so cool about the entire situation is amazing.  While the destructive trio plus Meghann proceeded to do...(well, I'm not sure what they did, aside from Dan sneaking into my room and putting porno wallpaper on my computer)...whatever, I, having gotten tipsy by now off of my couple of glasses of wine, proceeded to get into a long, drunken, conversation with Diller which finally ended at 4:30 a.m.-I'm just going to say that Diller is one of the best listeners I know, and I am so lucky to have such great friends.  There's this *thing* I'm going through right now, something that has been bugging me, big time, since last year, and he's probably the only person that can truly understand both sides to this situation, and hopefully not think I'm being ridiculous.  It just felt so good to once and for all to get it off my chest, and get advice.  Many thanks to Diller for once again, being there for his friends.    Meanwhile, I took the first step in trying to reconstruct a friendship with a certain person, but I must say that I think it failed miserably, and I really don't think that I have the time and energy to deal with this particular person anymore. I'm perfectly comfortable hanging out in a social atmosphere, but that's where it ends. I know friendships aren't easy, but this particular situation has gotten to a point of ridiculousness that I can't handle anymore.    So-that is the tale of the happenings at my uber-crazy dinner party.  In the beginning, I was kind of disappointed that some of my Centralia and Springfield friends couldn't make it, BUT-looking back, it's probably a good thing if you think about all of the nonsense that occurred.  All in all, it was quite the interesting evening.  With that said I'm going to go home to Centralia for the rest of the weekend, but I had to write about this before I forgot the details, so the whole world can have a record of just how insane last night was.  more later folks-Amy Lynnette's outta here.   P.S. I GOT MY INTERSHIP! I rule. All in all, with the exception of one certain thing-life is good, and it's getting better all the time. :o)
