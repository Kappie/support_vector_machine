And so, for certain parts of days, then, later, for whole days together, then, ultimately for many years or stretching cycles of years these children went forth whole, came back fragmented so that everyday, they were stan-dar-di-zedly richer and  soulshearts  poorer, both at once. Such violence, that.  Such service, that?     You know these brown children well. You know these red children well. You know these yellow children well. For, You fill them up to brimming, my God, to brimming with what you’re absolutely certain they need. Aware as you are. Bleeding as your heart is. Liberal as your vote, most of the time, registers. Revolutionary as the photograph of Che on the wall, whom they will never, of course, read in your world. There is no place for Che. There is no time for Che. There is no translation for Che.   Instead,  Dickens became part of these children, and Emerson and Thoreau. Bradbury, Forster, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Huxley, Conrad, and JOYCE.      Those skirted soldiers Chopin, Woolf, Bronte I and Bronte II, Eliot, Austen, and Shelley became a token part, produced a flicker, moved on so that Williams, Miller, Chekhov, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Sophocles could paint with pens on their little minds. Ah, so full, so full of goodness.  And they were filled to brimming with the very best of truth, beauty, art--as dictated by 10% of the global land mass. Seems, illogical.  Somehow, is not.  For those who refuse to see.  And they came to know by rote:  Once upon a time and a very good time it was... It is a truth universally acknowledged... It was a pleasure to burn... There was no possibility of taking a walk that day... When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow... In the country of Westphalia...  And they all became a part of them.  And what is not there, especially in the case of these self-loathing angels forced into complicity, tells much more.  The:  They say when trouble comes close ranks... My world is compressed... The rains were so late that year... This is how, one sunrise, we cut down them canoes... May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month... Barrabas came to us by sea ...are never considered, let alone recite-able proof positive that they are well read. So many, so many more. And the children may wonder what else there is, fleetingly, before they again return to devouring what will make them successful.   ...the fascination of the abomination...   This brown child hangs her head low, lower still, for not knowing, and for not fighting to know, and for how full to brimming she used to be proud of being.  All of these pieces became part of those children who went forth everyday, (the wealth and the poverty) and who now go (confidently and ashamed) and will always go forth everyday (until the end of time, or until, in a symbolic gesture toward moving in the right direction, the children go forth to murder the entire Modern Library Board. Even Maya Angelou, who could not be bothered to show up and vote for that historic, publishing house coup du monde).  _______________  My prose, today, will be brief. I hope that my poetry is screaming what I don't have the inclination to say plainly...at this moment.   I am a bit sick of soul and it will no longer allow me to keep quite separate from this blog anything really telling about the program of graduate study in which I am currently enrolled. I have tried, my God, have I tried to leave that business away from this page. But I can't write today...and writing again here is long overdue...without at least a vague reference to the sadness and disappointment and hurt which has brought me to tears at least ten times over in the last three days alone. Having a heart and living in the world is a nasty business I grow very weary of...these days.  This poem was written for a class. The assignment was to use Whitman's "There Was a Child Went Forth" as the model for our own poem. Beginning the day the poem was due, my professor asked students to share their poems with the entire class. Not mine.  Often, I find that the best way to live the rest of my life (the majority of which has nothing at all to do with this bit of graduate work) with some happiness and tranquility is to leave it where it is. Don't bring its issues home  all of the time . If I had done, the stuff in my veins would have turned into the most toxic of acids by now. My mother has always tried to keep me calm, so I don't hurt myself by letting everything touch me so very deeply. So, I've tried to forbear. I have mastered measured breathing and sitting on my hands which can shake quite uncontrollably when I am disquieted. I swallow words...I smolder...but I swallow the bile. And perhaps more than anything else I've ever shared with this group of people, I wanted to read this poem to them. I wasn't allowed to... we couldn't read them all...we had to move on...no reason to abuse your classmates so close to them getting the ultimate validation that is their degree . Whatever the reason, I hadn't wanted to, but had to, yet again, swallow my words.   Why didn't she let me share my poem?
