I think the stuff they can do is crazy cool.  It is so much cooler than shooting a ball in a basket.  I mean throwing your skateboard and jumping and flipping and landing on it requires crazy skill.  I am definitely going to Germany to watch the German version of the Xgames-Circle of Balance.  It is crazy how good these kids are.
