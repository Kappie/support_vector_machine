So my dad made the decision that he's going to cancel the trip to Oregon. He knows my mom's not going to recover enough by that time and he doesn't want to go without her again. Which is fine, and I wouldn't want to go without her either, it's just too bad. He said we might go to Jasper the last week b4 my brother goes back, and just ignore how much it's going to cost and rent a nice place for a week. That would be awesome... especially Jasper, it's so pretty there.   It's too bad that we're going to miss it cause I was looking foward to it but I mean, it's a good reason why we arn't going to go, it's not like oh.. yeah lets not go or something. Well maybe I'll get to go visit melissa then.. that would be fun.  My mom's still not feeling well... on monday she will have been in the hospital for three weeks, suckky. My dad said that she said or rather wrote... that it would be okay if I came up to visit her tonight, which would be nice cause I havn't seen her since tuesday and I really miss seeing her. And it prolly wouldn't be okay for my brother to go because she has tubes down her throat to pump her stomach and he would be really freaked out to see her like that but he's going to a friends house for a sleepover at like 7 tonight so me and my dad will be able to go.
