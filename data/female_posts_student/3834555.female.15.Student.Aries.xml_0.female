Heather, Nathanail and i were at chapel at camp, but we were outside counting offering money... so Heather wants to go back to the hotel cuz we have to leave at 3:30am and she's like "hey, Karsen will you go get Nathanails stuff from out of chapel??" so i walk into the chapel hall to get the bags... so i am kneeling down grabbing toys and stuffing them into a bag when the guy speaking, PastorJeffery goes "ok, everyone pause, i need to say something for someone here.. this is TOTALLY off the subject but i feel God calling me to say this" so everyone stopped fidging and stuff and looked up at him waiting.. i just kept stuffing toys into bags not paying attention when Jeffery goes "there is someone out there, in this room, a young woman, who needs to hear this" and i am still stuffing toys blah blah blah when the most jdklfjkd part comes... Jeffery just says this " be careful you like, because you just might fall in love with them" ok, so at that point i was just like "YEAH, i KNOW that!" then he goes " you cant help whoyou love, your heart tells you,love is a unexplianable feeling no one will understand.. until they feel it..but, all this confustion will die. all the heart ache will lead to heart full, just love GOD with all your heart! He knows what you want and will not betray you, or leave you.... or hurt you. everything will be ok." i seriously starting bawling right there... ok, not BAWLING but crying... i have never felt so.. talked to in my life... camp is going to be sooo awesome! God is going to rock the places roof off! and even if i am feeling alone with all my friends and i am heart hurting God will fix everything, cuz GOD loves me!! ... so this concludes by this: i am not telling Kasey, whatever happens.. happens. yes, it hurts the worst waiting, but GOD is there and He is the one i should focus on right now, not Kasey... not like that anyway. Kasey is my BEST FRIEND and that he will stay.
