I miss my website, and I think it helps my mental state to get some of my feelings out, which I have yet to do with an  actual  person so writing to the internet and those who take time to read this(..uh) will have to do.  I may decide this will be a permanate home for my blog..seeing that some people know my web address and it might be best that they not see it, even though it's non-existant there right now. Anyways.  I go through the same every year, some years it's worse than others, I fall into this gross ugly hole of depression, and I can say it is not in the least bit fun.  Many would say I need help, I had gone quite a long time with out hurting myself...but I did today, I was crying...quite a bit...but then I just stopped, so it was a temporary release of my...whatever it was, which probably isn't the most healthy way to do that, but it worked, and I'm ok for now and I'm gonna stop...see...done.  I hate highschool...I really do. I have this deep passion towards hating it.  I was slightly looking forward to the play this fall...that sometimes makes me feel good..but that's usually because I can get the role I want, but I didn't.  After I was already feeling stupid and worthless I went to check the cast list and Brittany had gotten the part...that really upset me.  The day before she had said to me "She'll probably cast me as Ruth...", well Ruth was the character I was set on getting.  When I went to check the list Brittany was sitting on the floor and I looked and then for some reason she felt the need to keep repeating, "I told you! I told you so!! Didn't I tell you!?" I just kind of nodded and turned away and she said "Aww Sarah don't be mad." I just wanted to tell her to fuck off. But I didn't.   I'm hoping P.E.A.C.E. Project will get me feeling better.  So far I am liking some of the people involved and it's fun, I'll just have to get over my extreme shyness so I can actually say something rather than just sitting alone. Wow..I sound like a winner...I'm gonna go to bed.
