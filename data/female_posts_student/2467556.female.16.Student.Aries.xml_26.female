My Niko was doing pretty well.......i just wish he would get more aggressive and slam people into the glass and stop with the i'm-just-going-to-hook-you-because-i-don't-want-to-touch-you thing.  Yeah.....its ok though, i still love him!!!  Oh man, you guys should see Brittany when Mike does something wrong or the other team scores a goal......she falls on her knees and yells, its soooooo funny! LOL Britt, i just had to say it, but you know i love you!!!!!  Its ok, i did that at Metroplex Championship and State last year for hockey.  Every time Southlake scored a goal, it was like someone stabbed me.  Very much like when Dallas played Detroit and lost 6-2.  So i completely understand your pain.    Raise your glasses to the Stars, for they haven't lost in their last 3 games (i think, don't take my word on that)!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~
