Or maybe because I feel like I'm growing apart from a certain person.  I see him everyday when I walk to Biology.  He's always talking to this one girl.  And sometimes I think if only we were in the same grade.  But then I run into Jacob and Jake and they're both sophmores and have always taken time to say hi or comment on my hair.  I dunno Jake told me my hair looked nice once.  But why the fuck cant he ever say something nice during school.  On the weekends and on trips I think could you flirt anymore,  but then like a meathead he can't talk to me in front of other girls in his class.  It sucks.  But I did tick him off the other day.  I was walking to class and I saw Matt Grimes and he was walking in front of Matt and I said hey to Matt and I talked to him a bit, because he never talks to anyone.  Plus I think it gave him an ego boost because he despises him.  But I blew him off like he blows me off.  That showed him.  And Matt would never act in a weird way if I said hello.  No telling what the other person would do.  He does come and talk to me in the hall though sometimes.  Michael is becoming a closer friend.  I can tell because he will smile at me in the halls.  He never used to do that.  Huh.  Well I feel a little better.  Maybe things will look up at Gatlinburg.  Three days of competeing, fun, flirting, and him.
