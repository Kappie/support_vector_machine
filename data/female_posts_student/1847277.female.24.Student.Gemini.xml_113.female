I mean, I travel a lot, shouldn't that mean I have an interesting life?  Apparently not.  I spent the day reworking the budget for my funding proposals (AGAIN!), but I think I'm finally done.  Now I just have to bump up the proposals themselves, and then I'll be good to go.  Okay, this is random and perhaps uninteresting, but, I'll include a brief story from my trip to Germany last summer...  I have yet to really experience culture shock-- I didn't even have a problem in Peru-- but I definitely noticed some things about Germany that are definitely unique.  Or, at least, different than the way things are here.  Like the fact that women in their mid-to-late 40s have no qualms about wearing clothes you wouldn't see on anyone over the age of 19 here in the States.  And the fact that kids run wild with seemingly little supervision.  The site that I worked at last year was a cave near a small city in southern Germany, along some of the fabulous bike trails that cross the Schwabian Alb.  The cave was next to a small river and  an open field with a grill pit and some picnic tables for those visiting the site or just wanting to stop while on a biking trip.  Every now and then we'd get field trips stopping by, some of whom had signed up for a tour and demonstrations of Paleolithic technology with the leader of the dig.  When these kids would arrive, they generally ran amuk, frolicking in the stream (after stripping to their underwear), trying to climb up the steep embankment outside the cave, etc.  One of the activities was making their own spears, which they would then throw at a target.  To do this, each of these kids (who were never more than 8-10 years old) had their own (usually very sharp) pocket knife, and they'd just run around blade first.  Then they made pointy sticks, which they also ran around with.  How eyes did not end up getting poked out is beyond me.  On one particular trip, after making the aforementioned pointy sticks, they decided use the sticks to grill sausages over the fire.  Meaning the kids were essentially playing in/around an open fire, with no adults in sight.  I can't picture any of this ever happening on a field trip in the States.  Anyhoo, in the midst of this chaos, one particular hot dog went on quite the voyage.  A boy tried to put it on his stick but ended up breaking it in half.  He carried it around for awhile, but it eventually ended up getting dropped on the ground.  Not just on the ground, but on top of a wool stocking cap (I'll note that it was mid-June and near 80 degrees).  We found this particuarly funny and I have a great digital picture of said sausage, but unfortunately I have no website on which to post photos, so you'll just have to trust me.  I thought this would be the end of the story, but no... about fifteen minutes later, a girl walks by, notices the hotdog on the hat on the gravel, looks at it for a minute, then proceeds to pick it up, put it on her pointy stick, grill it, and eat it.  Ah, the amusement.    And there's a lame story for you. :)
