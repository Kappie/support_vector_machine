Yesterday I had dropped off some film at Walgreens, and today at like 5 I called and I asked if my film was ready and they said umm no its not you got the wrong Walgreens and then hung up. What the hell? I dropped off at the right place yesterday and I no I had the right number!! Alex called at 5:30 and I told her about it and she said well lets just walk up there. So I left at about 6 and we went up there. We get up there and theres 2 guys at the photo thingy. One of the guys was the one I gave my film to and the other was some different man. I said are my pictures done? He said no you called earlier we dont have your pictures. I said wtf I just dropped it off to him yesterday. The man was like yes she dropped em off. So they're searching for film and they find it, they got the pictures done but they put em on the photo cd yet, they say come back in a hour we'll have it ready. So me  alex leave and go back to her house and just sit there until 8. We finally got my pictures when we drove up to Walgreens. Never taking my film to Walgreens again! Schnucks > Walgreens. Didn't talk to John until about 8:40. Aaron called at about 8:30 asking me to take him to work at 9. When I was on the phone with Aaron, Alex called asking me if she could take me to get some fundraiser thingy. I get off the phone with both of em and John calls me and says he'll call me back when I get home. So by the time im set I got Aaron, Alex  Sterling in the car. I drop off Aaron at work and I cant take Alex because my car starts smoking. So I drop off Alex at home and about 2 houses down I drop off Sterling. What I didn't no was that John was at the same house. Sterling gets out and John comes up to the window and asks me where I'm about to go? I say im going home are you gonna call me? He said I dunno if you acting right. I said wtf did I do? I am acting right! I said call me in like 10 mins. He said if you acting right. I said whatever and drove off. He never called. I walked back up to Alex's at 9:30 and he was outside. He didn't say anything to me and saw me. So right now he's acting like a bitch and I dunno why. Boys these days are retarded assholes. He'll get some words tomorrow, if he calls. He aint nothin but a bum anyways.
