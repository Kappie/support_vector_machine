I will be getting my last check at the end of my shift and I won't have to go back to that place...Till Saturday...When I pick up the moving truck we are using to move to Victorville.  Brenden is still in San Jose. I don't remember if I had mentioned the car trouble he was having, but he has a rental car up there. He is having fun with the kids he is volunteering for. The kids are high school students who are leaving for foreign exchange in countries in Europe and in Japan. It only proves how pathetic I am that I get jealous that he is far away doing fun, great things and I am here...Packing...To move to the densest part of the actual "middle of nowhere".  I talked with some other buddies and they tell me how great their new apartment or their new girlfriend are. I am sincerely happy for them, but boy does it sting.  I am being melodramatic. Over reacting....In the stupid sense of the word. I'll get over it. I just need to sleep. A lot.
