Apparently brad thought i meant like 7 30 or something so he called me a bit b4 8 this morning and woke me up! *lol* Oh well, i woulda gotten up soon neways and i got to hear brad's boys state stories!  Chilled this morning--ya know, the whole internet and munchies thing!  Spent the majority of my day @ optimist *6 hours* but it was pretty fun, least to begin w/ when more pple were working.  After the thunderstorm some lifeguards and stuff got sent home so it became kinda boring, but it wasnt too shabby.  Got a smoothie w/ Allie *she stole my NAME!* b4 hand so that lasted me awhile! along with my yummy bagel and watermelon! *haha* wow it actually sounds like i eat HEALTHY! so maybe i wont mention what i just ate out of my dad's father's day present just now! *haha* Hadta close out by myself with only a little bit of help from mean susan..gr! But yeah im proud of myself for that! Even if it did take a while.  Not working tomorrow but we'll see what i do.
