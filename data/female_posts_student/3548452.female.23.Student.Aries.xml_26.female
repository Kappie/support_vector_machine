Yesterday I was feeling really good... up until my boss, who did nothing but check to see how much it was going to cost him to go get his master's, decided to try to make me look bad. Our sponsors paid $250 for an ad in a book and I'm waiting for him to come and approve it- then he wants to argue with me because I'm not going to clutter it up with a bunch of junk we dont need- just like the supplies that he asks me to order that we dont need, and the things he wants me to waste paper to print when we dont need them. I'm not one to waste anything- especially not money or supplies... and I definitely am not going to endorse something that looks hideous when I know people paid good money for it. So I'm arguing with him about this flyer, and here comes Jay- pming me just to say "hello" I didnt get to him till about 5 minutes later- and I know he didnt pm me unless he had a lil bit of time so when he didnt answer, I pm'ed him again. When he still didnt answer (as he's done so many times before) I snapped and told him not to pm me if he's gonna be like that. Well then he goes off on this spiel later that day saying "if you think I'm gonna wait all day for you to pm me back then you have problems" yada yada yada- said he wasnt waiting 30 minutes for me to pm him back and he wouldnt pm me anymore. Well this just was the last straw. I told him to suck a dick and to never speak to me again. I try and try and TRY to be his friend, I make all the effort- I go see him, I pm him, I keep the whole friendship going, 'cause if I didnt talk to him, you can guarantee he wouldnt talk to me unless he really wanted a piece of ass. We're not even friends anymore- so why am I bothering. Right at that moment, I felt lower than a speck of dirt on the ground and I'm wondering just what am I doing this for? Why do I beat myself up about it? Everything just overloaded my brain all at once, and I am feeling like, maybe it's me. Maybe it's a bad thing that I was born black- only because I like white guys- a LOT and I'm not really into black guys. I fell in love with one when I was 14 and I am still in love- whether he knows or cares is beyond me. I let myself love another one at 18, and he stuck a knife to my throat and then claimed to love me. I let myself love Jay and all he does is bring me down. So I am just mopey and tryin not to cry- here comes Scott, making it worse. See, we messed around, and he tells me a week later he just got out of a long relationship and he doesnt want to settle down, he just wants to be friends, etc... Well a week later he is all in love with my friend. He's white, she's white, things are kinda cut and dried. I know you cant help who you fall in love with, but when he is still hitting on me and touching me, it kinda puts a damper on my day. So he sees me all upset and is like, "Im your friend, I love you, I dont want to see you hurt, blah blah blah" and I'm getting more pissed by the minute 'cause I dont want him to touch me. So I'm fighting to cheer up just so he will leave me be and he's getting drunker and drunker- it's his birthday. Eventually he's walking around asking for birthday kisses- big ut oh. Yes I had to 'cause if I didnt, I'd look suspicious. So then finally it's the end of the night, and he's rubbing my back once again trying to comfort me when it kinda slips a lil too low to touch some skin. I'm in big trouble here tonight 'cause he's getting drunk already and I'm by myself- not by choice mind you. Did I forget to mention he blocks me at every turn? He doesnt like me talking to guys at all. So I"m stuck between a rock and a hard place. But on the other hand, I am meeting some really awesome guys (or so I thought till this morning *straight face*). I kinda like a few but it's not anything serious nor will it be- I'm staying away from any guy I meet online. Oy... maybe one day I'll meet a decent one, but I aint puttin out until they prove it to me. I gotta go. I'm done venting for the day :D
