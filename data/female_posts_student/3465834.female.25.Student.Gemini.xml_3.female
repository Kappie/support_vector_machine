People are always telling me that I have a "flare" or is it "flair" for writing and that they enjoy the novel sized e-mails I send home at random.  Rather then bombard e-mail inbox's I thought I'd try my hand at blogging.  I read a couple blog's every so often, that of Barlow www.barlowonline.com and my friend Paul at which time I cannot seem to locate that particular address but I promise to post it another time.  So I googled free blog web sites and this is what I found.  So far, not so good...  Am I nervous?  Is it possible I have nothing to say?  That can't be it...  Maybe it's the pressure to actually come off intelligent and have some interesting topics like world politics and the environment (which for the record from what I've seen is what mose blog's are like) that's making this painfully dull?  Ok anything new to report? Tried to go see Barlow over the weekend in Ottawa, the Tulip festival actually and it was cancelled due to inclemant weather (rain).  The one day this beautifull long weekend that I didn't want it to rain, typical.  I guess I'll just have to wait till they come to the Bomber in June, in the mean time, I will think about how cute Damian the drummer is and hold onto that for the next month.  I wonder if I can post pictures?  If I can I will write all about my trip to Banff before I either A) Kill the brain cells that encompass the memories of the trip with alcohol or drugs or B) procrastonate for so long that I actually forget the trip or even C) ....  nah this one is going to be another kill the brain cells reference and I think we all know that's the most likely outcome.  How does one end a blog? Like this? Bye? I guess I'll learn as time goes on, I welcome comments and help, but please be nice, I'm just one person with nothing all that interesting to say, so if you do not like it, go harass someone who's trying to induce antics.  ;)
