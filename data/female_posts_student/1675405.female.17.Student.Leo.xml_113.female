Maybe one day, years down the road, you will look back and understand why I said the things that I said. Not because I'm jealous, not because I am just simply "mad," but because I see people stepping all over you, and I think you deserve more than that. Hopefully I'll just have the patience to keep putting up with this.  And  you.  You went for a stupid boy, too. What's going on with all of you girls lately? Don't you realize that if someone doesn't treat exactly how you know you deserve, that someone down the line will?  I don't know. Well, what I do know is this: I'm always there for all of you whenever I think you need someone to fall back on. So why aren't you here for me now? Is it that you think I know you care? Because I don't. Tell me once in awhile.
