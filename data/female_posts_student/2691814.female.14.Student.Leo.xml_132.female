Me Ryan and Samantha hung out for an hour after school..no point in going home so we just stayed then went to the dinner...which was cool cuz they had the tables decorated. Then we went dancing!...it was soooooo much fun! Everyone was just shakin it(including me)and it was just awesome....danced with ryan on the slow songs  :)  andthen on the fast songs all of us would just mingle around and just dance with guys and stuff. Lemme tell you, Carlos is an awesome dancer...bump and grind lol. And once we got Tim dancing he was really good too + ryan was actually good too! There were about 2 slow songs. Then the rest were like hip hop and maybe 1rock song lol. But when the spanish songs came on..deidra,ryan,sam,tim and I all danced..it was funny cuz we're all white lol. We got caught by the same chaperone maybe 4 times cuz we were all dancin so close in a 'sugestive' manner lol. And i think one of them thought me and paola were gay cuz we were dancing together on one of the fast songs lol. It was funny tho cuz she was like 'u need to have space' lmao.     It was alot of fun...The gym had some cool purple stuff on the basketball hoops and stars and stuff. Everyone looked great...almost all the girls wore dresses. Some of the guys wore tux's and looked like pimps lol. And some guys kinda dressed down...not really formal. But anyway..ya it was alot of fun actually dancing.lol And im glad deidra decided to dance as well.  well....i think im gonna go to sleep cuz my feet are killing me from those shoes!
