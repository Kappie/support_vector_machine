Instead of being the second day of OMC, it is now the first day of Tri-County camp... So, I'll just be coming into camp halfway through the day. No big deal. I guess.... I'll have to have Joanna or Amy make a bed for me--as in put sheets on it and whatnot--so I will have a bed around people that I know...   Friday the Teen--err, Junior-- Leaders Club is going to the drive-in movies. I'm excited! :D I haven't been to the drive-in since I was about 8.... I saw  Casper . :)
