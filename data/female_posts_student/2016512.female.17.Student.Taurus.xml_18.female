It doesn't matter that you're crazy if you've found your way to be happy. Do what you want to do, dammit. Say "dammit" a lot and mean it. I'm starting to sound like the sunscreen song, so I'd better go sleep now.  Does anyone else get a strange high from playing those supertriplets in "Pirates of the Caribbean"?
