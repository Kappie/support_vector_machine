As I was venturing down the humid street, I heard my name faintly being called. I stopped out of confusion and searched for the voice who summoned me. It was next door neighbor. She informed me that her and her husband were going out of town for two weeks and she'd love it if I could water her beautiful flowers while they were away. I agreed since I've done little jobs like this for them before. She wandered in the house and put $5 in my hand and said, "$5 now and $5 when I get back." So that was cool, I was just going to the store and got $10! YaY! And I was only writing with weird words because it sounded cool. I'm not crazy. But speaking of money. People always say money can't buy happiness. But I honestly think it can. You can't really buy  good  friends but you can certainly meet lots of new people. You buy the house you always wanted, the car, everything. I know that's materialism but then maybe I'm materialistic because money could buy me happiness...
