Simko was there and that was cool. He told me kristi didn't have a problem with me like i thought she did so that's good. There is still an issue with craig, heather, and a lil bit mandie i think too and i hope they work it out because i really like all of them and i hate to see good friends like that get split up.   ..so yeah my back is really sore and it has been for a while. Andd i din't run today but i did fall asleep under outside under a blanket for a while and carissa called and i was like 'dad why didn't you tell me' and he said he tried but i was out so who knows.. i must have been tired.

I hate to think i've been blinded baby, why cant i see you tonight"
