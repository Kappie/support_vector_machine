We hung out from 10am-about midnight and I still found it extremely difficult to leave... crazy kid, how'd he do it? I haven't the foggiest! But the views were breath-taking, the conversation delightful and the other stuff.... exclusive Hehehehe... Let's just put it this way, it's all down in history for sure! I do recommend seeing the view from the Oddessey resturant where ever it is. Hopefully, this is just a beginning of more fun times to come. I just have to try not to be a smart-ass all the time, curse, correct constantly (though he swears its cute), and I think I will let him win an arguement or two now and again. *wink wink*   ~*~*~*~Brief pause at recollection of yesterday*~*~*~  What in Sam Hell was I talking about now?? Ok, I guess we should get some philosophical mombo-jumbo out of the way, since that is why I have this crazy contraption! I told Rob last night that no one lives for the moment, and everything you do is in preparation for a tomorrow which is uncertain of us ever seeing it. No matter how you think you are living, its apparent that it cannot be for the moment. The simple task of eating is to sustain you for a future moment and life. Work is to get paid in the future. So if one was to merely live for today, he wouldn't eat or work or even use the restroom because they are a waste of time and prevent you from enjoying the "now". I stuck up this conversation with my fav. prof and he said "Is God living for the moment?" and I replied, "God is not subject to time and cannot live, since he created time and life. He is eternal and cannot have personifications."  I stumped him and presented my hierarchy: Goodness (God has to be all good for most people) God Time Earth Man Each is subject to what is before it and dominated by what is after it. That's all for now. My dog is in a crate crying and its sooooo sad, My Poopie baby!!!!!!!
