They were unable to stop on the slick road and slammed into the back of a car. One of the girls, Donna, was thrown face-first through the windshield. The jagged edges of the broken windshield made two deep gashes in her left cheek.   At the hospital, the doctor on duty happened to be a plastic surgeon. He took great care in stitching Donna's face. Nevertheless, the driver was devastated by what had happened.   A short time later Donna's family moved away. Fifteen years passed before the driver happened to see Donna's mother, who gave him the following report. "Donna was so intrigued by her hospital stay that she became a nurse, got a good job at a hospital, met a young doctor, married him, and then had two children. God took a stormy day and created a beautiful rainbow. Donna told me that the accident was the best thing that could have happened to her!"   God is not the initiator of tragedy and suffering in our lives, but He is always there to bring some good to every situation. If you are in the midst of a fierce storm, don't lose hope. Look for the rainbow!
