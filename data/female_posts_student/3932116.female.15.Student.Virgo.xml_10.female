We like to talk to each other and vent. we have a circle of friends that we used to call the "super seven"...pretty middle school, i kno, however, that was us. we had really good times when it was the 7 of us. i miss that..a lot. i've always been happy-go-lucky kaytlin...that's been me. but as of late, i haven't been. i've been like, depressed kaytlin or somethin. we had 2 people in our class die this past year...as a sophomore, i've lost 2 classmates. it always comes back to that. i've had to grow up so much in the past year, it really hasn't been good for me, i least in the short run it hasn't. my social life is so messed up. my friends are retarded, like obsessed w/ high school drama i swear. my one friend can't go out with the guy she's been dating cuz he has psycho parents, but she's still "devoted to him" however, now her best guy friend and her, who she's already gone out with twice, decide that they still have chemistry. now we are a really tight knit group, we've tried "inner circle dating" before, it doesn't work. all of us are worked up about it. and i'm tellin ppl this stuff which is prolly gonna get me in hot water but i really don't like the idea. I don't kno, i mean, i love my friend to death buti just am really tired of the high school drama...that's it for tonite..i gotta talk to my friends on messenger now..try to solve some problems, joy to the world.
