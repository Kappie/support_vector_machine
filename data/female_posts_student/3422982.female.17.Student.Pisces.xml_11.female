I just wish I could have gotten an appointment with a therapist sooner.  And to make things worse, Molly wasn't here today to help me.  She's a camp counseler for the rest of the week.  Hope she has fun though.  I may not get to take my drive test.  I don't think I will, but everyone else is being optimistic.  Today is also Mom's birthday.  We're not taking her out for dinner like we usually do, but Phil is taking her out Saturday, I get to stay at home.  Great fun...  my life is shit... I'm sore, I'm sick, and I'm still down.  I'll just keep the mask on, and hope it doesn't fall off anymore... cuz that was embarrasing.   later dayz
