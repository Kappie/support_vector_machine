Like nothing can come between you and youd strive to be with each other and sacrifice more than half of your time dedicating it to the person that you're in love with. Nothing in the world could have torn you apart. Its funny how you think something that feels so good can tear you to pieces, rip your heart out and spit on it like it was nothing to begin with. Never in a million years did i ever think we'd end this way. The relationship didnt even die by its own hand and THAT is whats going to keep me holding on. The fact that  I  didnt do anything to you and  YOU  didnt do anything to me. But theres no one to blame for our seperation but ourselves. As much as im hating to say this, they're only doing it because they care. And i know you hate them but you have to try and understand that they only want me to be ok. Im not proud of what we did anymore and i see so much more wrong with it then right. As much as i loved it, it WAS wrong. Im so sorry that it ends this way. Im so sorry that it ends.. and baby i know, every tear i cry you'll feel and everytime i lay out at night and talk to the stars, you'll hear me, and everytime i say i love you, you'll feel it. I just wish that there was a way around this but sweety there's not. i'll say what i've said all along. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, ALWAYS. and i'll ALWAYS CARE FOR YOU AS I DO NOW. They'll seperate us baby, but they cant make me not love you. I'll never EVER forget you, the way you made me feel, the things you've done for me, or how much i love you. Baby you're one in a god damn million, you're perfect and i wouldnt have you any other way. But they're making me let go and theres not a thing i can do about it. I love you so much and i never wanted to have to say this, bye...    From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat Cause I never Never have before
