Well I'm glad you asked.  My arm muscles hurt.  I was helping a friend move yesterday for 6 hours.  kinda sucked my ass.  but they fed me pizza, so it was cool.  I lifted more than the men cause they were wimps and just wanted to play video game.....what loosers (I say as I spend my free time writing down what happend to me yesterday on a computer.....oh well, my mom thinks I'm cool) Oh and there was this guy who reminded me of my 14 year old brother only he was 19.  He thinks he's part cat and often meows loudly. At our first meeting he repeatedly rammed his head into an elevator door and burped real loud....charming fellow.  and there was this other guy who reminded me of robert (my 19 year old brother)  He was scruffy and had the drug addict look, Erika would have found him attractive.  but I think he was trying to hit on me.  Me and Vicky (the girl I was helping move) were talking about Olando Bloom *swoon*  and she was getting all it and mentioned something about tying him up with a silk scarf.  and I made the comment nothing wrong with a little bondage.  then later when me and his guy were in the elevator, he was like " so, about that comment you made earlier, you like bondage?"    they he began to ask me if I was single and how he picks up girls and how he was in the market for a girlfriend, and I wanted to throw up and tell him how creepy this all was because he reminded me of my brother, but I didnt' want to hurt his feelings so I just took the stairs.  Then I was talking to vicky and she was telling me that he was slightly autistic, but not like normal autism.....its just like he's mentally imature.  he's 23 but he acts like a 15 year old, then I felt bad for almost throwing up. O.k, well I have to go to work *grumbles incoherently* so I'll catch y'all on the flip side.  Oh yeah, hi Tracy, Nikol (sp?)and anyone else who is on this server whom I haven't met.  Tootals :)
