My body is still working really hard to defend against the nasty cold/flu thing that everyone else in the department is succumbing to, but I think it's starting take over.  The past couple days I've had sore throats and I've also been really exhausted come evening.  Ah well.  So I found out today that I won the fellowship that I applied for in January.  It's only $500, which isn't much, but hey, it's better than nothing.  And I'm proud that I won it, even though I'm guessing not more than half a dozen people applied.  Yay for funding to help me pay for my summer voyage.  Now, the poo story:  I don't know if I've posted about this, but for a few weeks we had this problem wherein the cat would poo on the floor nearly every night.  Only at night, and always in the same general spot near the front door.  This was, of course, very annoying, so we tried changing her food, cleaning the closet with the litter box, getting a new box and new litter, and nothing at all worked.  Finally, we thought that maybe something in the closet scared her at some point (although she's used that closet for the past year without trouble), so we got a new, smaller box in addition to the old one and put it in the bathroom.  Problem solved.  Although she uses the downstairs box occasionally, she would only poo upstairs.  And over the past week, I've noticed she has a habit of pooing whenever I am in the tub/shower, no matter what time of night that is.  This is unpleasant, especially when you're enjoying a relaxing bath, because who wants to smell cat poo while bathing?  So today I thought, I'm tired, I don't feel well, I want to enjoy my bath pillow and read in the bath.  So I shut the door.  And what does she do?  Poos on the floor in the same old spot downstairs while I'm in the tub.  F(@Q#$%@!((~!!!  Stupid cat!!  She is the most spiteful creature I have ever seen.
