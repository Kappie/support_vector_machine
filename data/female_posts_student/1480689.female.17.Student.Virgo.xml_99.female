However, rebounding on Ravelle, is not the best             idea.        1.) It will make ravelle and my friendship more rocky        2.) It will make it hard to get over me, for the fact that Ravelle and I are friends.        3.) It hurts me to know that he wants to be with her              a.) Granted, I'm not allowed that emotion when it comes to this situation,                                 but it is still occuring. c.) Bri and I made up today after school        1.) I apologized, told her i missed and loved her.        2.) I hope that her hugs and words of freindship were true              a.) I do not doubt her, I am just scared I lost her as a friend altogether. d.) Got a new, or should i say different, car.         1.)1989 White, Four-Door, Cavilier. :-D I        2.) It has a radio.  WOOT!  e.) Homecoming group:         1.) Mike  I, Joey  Elena, Kopplin  Amber, Blake  Joy, and Nick  Misty        2.) Prime Quarter, time TBD  holla.
