I burn CD's all the time. do i really care whats going on in the musci industry? heck no! i just wrote that speech to make the judges happy (no offense.) Anyway, so now that that is all cleared up, i can be a happy camper again. mmm... camps...they're happy. weee. just being scary. its late. that explains all.
