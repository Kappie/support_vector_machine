I should be researching apartheid, but obviously, I'm not. I'm kinda just sitting here as my brain slowly rots away.   This is really quite boring. Grad dress shopping this weekend. Mark is wearing blue. I wanna wear black and red. Do blue, black and red go together? I don't think so. Maybe we can pull it off anyway. Hmm ...   So I still don't know whether we're officially dating or not. We're just kinda, in the middle. I suppose it's ok, but something a little more official would be nice. Oh well, I'm not complaining. It's not like things are horrible.  Anyhow, nothing else to write. Maybe update later. Should I give this URL out? I think it would be smarter not to. For now, anyway.  PS Why does he like me? WHY? I need to work on my sense of self worth and gain some self esteem. Right now, I have no clue as to why he likes me. It's really ridiculous. How could any guy see in me what Mark sees in me? It's so strange having a guy think that I'm pretty and actually worth something more than a night of drunken fun. I suppose I'll just stop thinking about it so much and just take it one day at a time... maybe then I'll get better at this whole being a girlfriend thing and maybe I'll get used to the idea that a guy actually likes me. I doubt it, but I can still hope right?
