UGH  But I want to be a better example to my kids and just this over and done with.  LOL  I figure if they see that I am not scared then maybe they won't be so scared.  So how are you all doing? (all three of you)  haha  Well I hope everyone is having a good summer.  I know ours has been nice.  I have a lot of stuff to do before I go back to school...and I think I have a WIC appointment tomorrow...oh crap, what time is that?  UGH  Organization, organization, organization...you would think if I said it enough times it would work, right?
