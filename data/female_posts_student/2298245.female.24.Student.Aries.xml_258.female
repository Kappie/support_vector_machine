I began reading  urlLink this piece by Christopher Buckley , and it was very funny.  You should all read it, but some of the highlights:   Historically, you have to be careful interpreting royal gestures, or before you know it you're slicing up archbishops in the cathedral.   and:   The bottom line of my extensive research with the Oxbridge dons and the focus groups was that the English people value one quality above all else in their monarchs: killing the French.    I haven't finished the story yet, so perhaps I will come across more funny things to share.  The story is vaguely about Prince Charles hiring some American PR guy to help him change his image in Britian.  And yes, it's fiction.  In the story, he recounts the (true) incident in which a recorded phone conversation caught the Prince telling his mistress that he wanted to be reincarnated as a tampon...and I'm sure you can imagine the rest.  I remember hearing about this story, and finding it so ridiculously silly that it isn't even funny.  And thinking about it tonight, I just couldn't stop laughing.  Perhaps it is not kind to laugh at the misfortunes of others, but I couldn't help it tonight.  If I lived anywhere else but New York, I might have looked crazy, because the particular giggly humor of this didn't hit me until I was walking down the street.  So on I went, light snow falling, and me either burying my face in my overlarge turtleneck or covering my face with my gloved hands, laughing to myself and by myself.   And I'm finally in a good enough mood to go to sleep.
