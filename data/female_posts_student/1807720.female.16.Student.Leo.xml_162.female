Of course I always so study and am going to study more tonight.  However, I know I can do good on that quiz tomorrow.  I know that I know the stuff, I just have to be confident and not bomb this quiz like that nitro/phos quiz.  That was hard.  Though it was cause of the wording that I did bad.  I knew all the info, just didn't understand what was being asked.  Drama was fun today and English is so much better now that we are doing novel study.  I'm reading Ethan Frome.  It's actually pretty interesting so far.  We had open gym in Active Living today and about 12 of us played some games of volleyball.  That was my dad.  Nothing too exciting I suppose.  I can't wait for tomorrow though, I have all this info stored into my brain for tests.  It needs to be unleashed!!  - By the way our theatre is haunted!  Like no joke.  Megz and I were in there working on some scene work and like every couple minutes there would be whistling.  We thought it was just someone on the catwalk, but Mr. B checked and there was no one there.  Lets say I wanted to get out of there fast!  It didn't help that most of the theatre was dark because the house lights were off.
