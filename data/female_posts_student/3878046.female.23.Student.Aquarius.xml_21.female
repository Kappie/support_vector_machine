I looked up at my clock when they left and it was 4am.  this bad sleeping pattern i've slipped back into has really got to stop.  which it probably will because my mum gets back tonight.  we did a lot of tidying yesterday, really just got to finish doing laundry and vacuum the carpets and we'll be good to go.
i woulda slept for longer today but the damn neighbours decided that drilling and basically using any power tools that have the ability to sound like they're pounding into your head, would be a good idea.  I'd totally forgotten that early sunday mornings was when they always choose to do this.
i can't wait to move down to canterbury.  I'm gonna miss my friends terribly but i'll have freedom down there and hopefully a job.  I kind of feel smothered here.
