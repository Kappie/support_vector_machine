While I am sure I am not alone in my plight ( how many big words can I put in before it gets wordy), at 2 o'clock in the morning, with the clock's ticking echoing through the house, it is hard it think otherwise. With only my dog as a companion, and I love the mutt but she is not much of a conversationalist, I am reduced to talking, or in this case writing to my self.   When my mind is not ocupied with other things it tends to present it self with largely unsolvable philosophical questions. These thoughts are largely entertaining, and slightly pointless, with just a dash of meaningful. Tonight my thoughts are revolving around something many fear, hell.   I believe that hell exists so the question is not so much weather it is real, as it is what is it like. This is what I'll set out on this lonesome night to unearth. My method for discovering these things is very simple. For two reasons, one, it is 2 am, and I don't think my brain could comprehend and thing more complex than a peanut butter sandwich, and two, because the simplest way is often the best.   So with this in mind I ask my self, what is hell? Hell is the opposite of heaven. If heaven is a perfectly happy place, hell must be a perfectly horrible place. Having decided on this I take an other mental step forward. What is the most horrible thing possible? The first thing that comes to mind is physical pain, as well as some pictures of a lake of fire I was shown in Sunday school. But despite these common beliefs I am not sure pain is the answer. I believe heaven is more that physical pleasure. Physical pain doesn't compare, in my opinion as an opposite to the happiness of heaven, its not deep enough. In short there are worse things than pain.   Now moving on, it occurs to me that emotional or spiritual pain seems to be the cause of most suffering in the world. I also believe the most deep set mental pain comes from the fear of being alone. When a best friend moves away we are sad because we will be lonely without them. When your boyfriend/girlfriend breaks up with you, you are upset because you are alone once more.   From this rambling argument I can only conclude that hell is being stuck with your self and having no contact with anything else for all eternity. Pleasant thought eh?   -Driel
