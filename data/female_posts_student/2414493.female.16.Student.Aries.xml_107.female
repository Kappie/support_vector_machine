We got our National Merit letters today. I'm at least commended, but that's not a pleasant thought. I almost think the barb of commended and just commended is worse than not doing it at all. I hope the cutoff is low. 222 for commended? That's preposterous. But then again, I'm biased. The usual brains were there, I guess. Maybe that sounds harsh. I'm in no mood to think of euphemisms. Shoot, where'd I put the letter?  Back to wontons with hot sauce.
