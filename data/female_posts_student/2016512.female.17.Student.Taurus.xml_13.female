Damn it, I got my parallel universes mixed up again.    I hope everyone (anyone?) enjoyed Youth Day.  I spent a good 4 hours babysitting a copy machine at the elementry school, but I got paid, so it's all good.  If anyone asks me to copy, collate, or staple anymore I will snap!  I'm so glad I'm not interested in education or business.  May I never have to take a course in Office Machinery Ettiquette for the rest of my life!  AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!    Sorry, the toner has gone to my head, Manda
