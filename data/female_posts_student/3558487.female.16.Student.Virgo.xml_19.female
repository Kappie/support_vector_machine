Nahh just kidding it'll be cool. The only part that ever worries me is lunchtime. I know that the odds are that i will know at least ONE person in my lunch, but still... its scary! Even when you're a senior!   I think i'm either getting sick or i am just extremely tired. Both are not so good. The weird thing is that i will be tired in the middle of the day, but not at 11:30 at night like right now. I'm wide awake now, but i was definately dragging all day long today. I did get to go shopping for some school clothes though and i got some super cute jeans and a few shirts! My mom said her goal was to keep me away from belts and shoes, since i have way too many of both of those. I did find two belts that i really like at american eagle. I'm thinking i'll sneak those into my birthday present from my parents. What can i say, i just can't resist buying belts.   Anyway, I usually would tell y'all what i've done all week, but i think its pretty clear to anyone who knows me what i've done all week. I'm really guna try and make this post not mention B-A-N-D in it at all because i realized that i have talked about it a lot and i'm determined to have a life outside of it! You know, for like 3 hours a day during the week and then the last half of saturday and all of sunday i'll have a life outside of it. :) Actually, i think i just broke my goal because i was just talking about band, i just didn't actually say the word. Oh well, can't say i didn't try.   So my parking spot is not so good. A two lane "road" is all that makes my spot a senior spot insteada a junior spot. Oh well, if you think about it, no spot is a bad spot. I mean, my spots last year were the ones by the tennis courts, and this one is definately better than that, so i'm happy. Plus, it's my parking spot and nobody elses which makes it neat too!   Summer is almost over and i can't believe it went by that quickly. I just realized that i never took my books and binder outta my backpack. It's still sitting on a chair in my room. I should clean that out sometime soon.   Ok, well that's all i feel like saying for right now.   -Lisa  Song: "Always On My Mind" - Phantom Planet  P.S. - I am trying to figure out a good bible verse to put on the back of my senior overalls and i have a few already picked out, but if anyone has a favorite and would like to make a suggestion please comment and let me know! :)
