For my day (Nat Day). I thought of it when Mr Lai wrote Nat Day on the board (National Day for short).  After school, we all went to the chem lab to redo the whole ofquestion 2 (salt analysis) (dread... can't go home early) because a compound used to make the substance Mhad expired. Mdm Leow also let usdo an experiment ourselvesso that we could smellnitrogen dioxide. The gas was areal stinko. I didn't do it but Yuen Theng did my share. I didn't dare to do it because I had accidentally scalded my finger when I tried to dry my test tube in a failed attempt. The sticks on teh test tube rack were so near to the wood with all the holes that I couldn't shuff the stupid test tube in! At first, Mdm Leow did an experiment at Wee kiong's bench. She let me smell but initially, I couldn't smell anything. Then when I went closer, I smelt it. Wee Kiong was a bit paranoid. He actuallywore goggles when he was looking at what Mdm Leow was doing. Haha.
