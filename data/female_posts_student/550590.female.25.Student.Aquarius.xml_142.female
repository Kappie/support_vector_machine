I want to re-read it (I was anxious to find out who dies) before giving it a thorough review, but let's just say that I was TOTALLY shocked by who died...up until about 4 chapters before it happened, and that the meeting Harry has with Dumbledore in his office toward the end of the book made me cry. Like I said, I'm a dork.  I was almost more amused by the pandamonium at Books-A-Million on Friday night than the reading of the book, which I rushed through in an effort to finish it over the weekend. I managed to get a free hat out of it, and I intend on wearing it at the office at some point this week...Now that Lauren's onboard, I've officially felt comfortable enough to move into my rebelious phase. The long term goal is to go from wearing flipflops to work (which I started a couple weeks ago) to eventually dyeing pink streaks in my hair. :)  Well, more to come, but for now, I've gotta get my Muggle ass to bed.
