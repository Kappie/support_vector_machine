It's going much better than expected, that is for sure.  Well, I don't really what I expected.  I think I expected to be in a lot more pain than this.  And I was for a while.  I still love him it's just...I've grown numb I guess.  Comfortably Numb.  Maybe I'm getting better at this whole breaking-up thing.  I made a mistake, but you can't change the past.  I'll just have to learn to live with it.  Besides, maybe Joce is right.  Maybe I do need a change.  A new guy would be a big change.  She says that I need to experiment.  Well, junior year looks promising.  I guess.  Although, She kind of forgot the key ingrediant in being able to experiment.  A GUY!!  Now, it is very easy for Jocelyn to experiment.  Let's face it, she's beautiful.  She could really have any guy she wants.  I, on the other hand, am not beautiful.  Which creates the problem that...well...guys don't exactly line up to be with me.  Granted, I've been able to snag a couple, but that doesn't mean that I'll be able to do it again.  Plus, only twice have I been able to get a guy that I liked prior to our relationship.  We'll not go into that though.  And, I still love David.  But every day it seems less and less possible for us to get back together.  And it's tearing me apart not knowing.  But I shouldn't be putting my life on hold waiting for him to come back.  I might have a chance with another guy (let's call him Steve).  And if Steve likes me too then maybe we could have something.  Plus, he's graduating next year, so this could be my chance to tell him I like him.  Even though....alright, I need to stop the madness here.  No one cares.  I don't even realy care.  Ok, yes, I do, I do care, but I shouldn't be ranting about it here.  Alright, I'm going to devote all my attention to my conversation with Sam about LAN parties and such.  And it is really late and I'm actually starting to get tired....imagine that.  Over and Out
