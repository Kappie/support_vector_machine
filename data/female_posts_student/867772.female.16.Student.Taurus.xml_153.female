Joey scared his parents when he popped outta the womb. He was born with Spina bifida. He had to have surgery right after he was born, and even then, the doctors thought he would never be able to walk, and that he would be severely hanicapped, both mentally and physically. Joey got very lucky. He's now eleven years old, and he's turned out to be one of the smartest, funniest, nicest, and most responsible little boys I have ever met in my life. He's a very healthy kid, and a very cool kid. He has had some problems, though. A lot of the same problems that my older brother had....socially and fundamentally and what not. He's going to be tested for Asperger's Syndrome, which is what my brother has. It's a form of autism, and given the signs, Joey is very likely to have it. Anyway, there's a school that's great for kids with this disorder, which is the school my brother went to for four years and eventually graduated from. It helped him  so  much. Joey and his mom Joni visit us a lot. they come down at least four times a year and spend a week or more with us each time. They love New England, and think there would we so many mor opportunities for Joey here. So, they were planning on staying here for the summer and looking at houses, then once Rodney had finished up with work in Vegas and Joni had picked out a house up here, They'd have Rodney come up with all their stuff, and live here. Joey came about two weeks ago with Joni, and Joni stayed for a while, then left Joey here so she could finish up some business in Vegas.  This was totally cool, cause Joey's like a brother to us.  Then Rodney got sick. Joni called a few days ago from Vegas to tell us that Rodney was in the hospital. They had found blood clots in his leg, and they were going to have to perform surgery to remove them. She didn't want us to tell Joey yet. I guess she didn't want him worrying. She was waiting until after the surgery.  I heard the phone ring at 1:30AM this morning, cause I was still awake, but I didn't think of much besides the fact that since my mom had woken up, she'd be coming downstairs to yell at me for not being in bed. She came downstairs, but she didn't yell, she just asked me to sleep so I'd be able to wake up for school. This was weird, but I was just relieved that I wasnt in trouble.  When my mom came into my room this morning to wake me up, she told me. I laid in bed for another twenty minutes trying to understand what she had said. The words that came out of her mouth were perfectly clear and understandable. What I didn't get was the idea the words formed.  I got on the bus, and cried.  I daydreamed my way through algebra, and skipped chorus with Erin to go to the library. She helped me a lot, and gave me some really great advice. She helped me find bible verses that made more sense of the situation, and we prayed.  I went to support during French and talked to Mrs. MacDowell. The I went to french and cried with my friends. I went to lunch, but I couldnt eat. Then I went back to support because I needed somewhere to sit and think. And cry. I just sat on the couch for an hour and a half. I had so much going on in my mind, I was shaking.  Then I went to gym to take my final exam, then eat, then sit. And think.  And I didn't even have the hard job that my brother and mom had. How do you tell an innocent eleven year old boy that his dad is dead?
