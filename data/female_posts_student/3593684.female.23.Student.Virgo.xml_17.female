I may need to re-think the prolife foto and re-name a few persons. I suppose this is an issue all bloggers must face.  Haha. I sound like one of those cheesy bands that get a single song on the radio and then they think they've made it big and they give these really ridiciously pretentious answers in interviews , "well, now that every station across America [ed. note: all owned by clear channel, of course]is playing our single   we are thinking about doing a world wide tour."   Speaking oflackof fame and fortune.How the helldo I make a links page. Iam soinept. I'd like a scroll bar of permanent links on front page. Time to look for some blogger instructions.
