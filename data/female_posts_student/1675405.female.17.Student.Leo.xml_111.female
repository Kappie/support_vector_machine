A lulluby in its purest form, this song could be the soundtrack of my life, playing every second of everyday, keeping me mellow and relaxed, and I don't think I could ever grow tired of listening to such joy. I absolutely love it.    "Slumber, my darling, the till morn's blushing ray brings to the word the glad tidings of day; Fill the dark void with thy dreamy delight--Slumber, thy mother will guard thee tonight, Thy pillow shall sacred be from all outward alarms; Thou, thou are the world to me in thine innocent charms."   Tell me you wouldn't enjoy being lulled to sleep by that.
