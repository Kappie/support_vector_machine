Her name is a world-wide brand.  That takes some serious  ganas  my friends.  And for that I give her some major props.  But that company she built, was probably built on the broken backs of others.  She's a royal bitch by many's accounts.  Perhaps even to the extent that she might actually be one - not just accused of being one by men who feel emasculated when faced with a strong woman.  Oh well.  But she's a powerful bitch.  So there's  urlLink this article from the New York Times  (you may need to register - it's free) speculating her amount of influence on Martha Stewart Omnimedia while she *might* be serving her 5 month jail term, followed by 5 months of house confinement.  Come on folks - it's Martha Stewart Omnimedia.  So Martha, you may be a meany who almost single-handedly made North American hausefraus and gay men neurotic about the precise fold in their linen napkins and how exactly to create those homemade marshmallows for high-class smores, but I still love you.
