Just my luck man! for Paper 2 i did not managed to complete 1 or 2 questions. Each consisting of 2 blurddy marks. Yes i'm very sad about it. Gosh! Nevermind there's N level. My last chance. Released early just now, at 11.55pm. Walk home with shasha,yanah,fahmi and iqah. Bebual mengarot ah they all. Ahahahakz. I'm not coming to school 2moro, can't be bothered to go,confirm very boring. National Day Celebration..? bahs. I rather study at home for the remaining 6 papers. Speaking of studying,shasha and fahmi ask if i wanna tag along they're studying physics and maths at mac. See first k guys..I can't study in there..noisy. Those piercing screams and cries are killing me. I have to visit my mummy later on. Furthermore i'm still recovering from the english prelim dilemma. I still have problems with blogspot.Especially the tagboard. Nvm,i'll still use this template for the timebeing. Oh yah i've got new comp! flat screen sia.. (bangga sey).. huhues.
