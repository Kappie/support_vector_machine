We got our yearbooks back, and I don't look like an idiot. or at least, I don't think I do, lol, I might. Also, I got my Graduation Exam results back and guess what?!!!!! I PASSED EM ALL!!!!!! *ish extremely happy* We didn't do much work all day either, which is also very good. Ooh, I had to go to the nurse's office, cuz my sunburn hurt so bad today, and I got Aloe Vera rubbed on it. It felt so good. But anywho, I had my shirt pulled up to let the aloe dry and stuff, and a guy walks in! He was so embarrassed, but I was in too much pain to be care. lol. He was in maybe 8th grade, but I think probly more like 6th or 7th. Anyways, the patch of sunburn on my chest is itching really badly now. It's not even as bad as my back, either. I think I'm going to die from sun poisoning!!!! *cries* Well, gotta go and try and get rid of the itch!  Love, Shannon "Put your dreams away for another day, and I will take their place in your heart. Wishing on a star never got you far. And so it's time to make a new start. When your dreams at night fade before you, then I'll have the right to adore you. Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling, and put all your dreams away."--Sinatra
