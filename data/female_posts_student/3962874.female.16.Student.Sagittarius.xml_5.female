My goal is somewhere near 2000 dollars. I know I could do it. The only question is if my dad has enough work for me to do. Mom figured out that working for my dad I make almost like 20 dollars an hour. That is very very good money for someone my age. But seeing that I don't get paid by the hour, I get paid by completion of projects, I can only make a limited amount of money due to lack of projects. Other than that, Daniel and I will probably jsut go swimming. Great fun.
