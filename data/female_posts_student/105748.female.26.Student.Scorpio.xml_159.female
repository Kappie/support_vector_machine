I tried to call my friend from Morgan Stanley and there was just busy signals.  I watched the rest of the activity on television and saw both skyscrapers fall and after that I was in disbelief that this would happen in the city where I lived.  I could not use my cell phone and the cable was disrupted for like 15 minutes there was no sound just pictures on the tv.  Hope you friends and relatives are alright.  My friend from Morgan Stanley, Jennifer Chu, is still missing.    ~net
