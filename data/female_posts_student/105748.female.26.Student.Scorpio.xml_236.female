Thanks for the invite Ching, but my 'puter is too slow. You'd be waiting for next move forever. It would not be worth your time.    I have a question for everyone. How did each of you run across Chingay? Were you just surfing the net? And since we seem to be the survivors of the Chingay Yahoo! Club what made you persist?
