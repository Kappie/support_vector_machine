I wish they called...cause even just to hear him in the background would be enough...Laura's sent me pics, and I've been looking through my pics of him......  I'm having a bubble bath later though. With candles. And enya music. And green tea and japanesse rice cracker thingies.  AND AHHH!!! Fiona just came online, she's home in Victoria, and is planning on going to Edmonton!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 SCREAMING!! This day went from really good to really bad to AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1*dances around*  I love you nicky poo.
