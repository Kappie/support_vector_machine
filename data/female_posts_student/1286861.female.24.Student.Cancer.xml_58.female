This, in some cases, could be very unhealthy. At times, in my case, it is. I feel this is what at times leads me to the inability to sleep.   Brenden left today for a week in San Jose. He was on his way up yesterday and his timing belt blew on his engine outside of Magic mountain. He had to spend lots of money to get it towed back to Orange County and he will be spending a lot more money getting it running again. He is making plans to bike for a while, and take the metro...bike to and from the metro...if that makes any sense. I am worried as hell for him. He rented a car to continue his attempt up to San Jose, spent just about the rest of his money. I baked him some chocolate chip cookies and he stopped by to pick them up and kiss me goodbye.  We kissed...A lot :)  He will be coming back to town on the 20th. I will be moved to Victorville by then. I hope...that's the plan. Speaking of which, I have to pack. That would be good, don't you think?
