I got to hang out with my cousin, Carrie. She's almost 11, I cant believe that because I can remember when she was born. I got to lay out and swim all afternoon. I'm about to go to my uncle's birthday party, and since my mom volunteered to keep my 2 year old cousin Jack for the weekend, there's an extra kid to look after. It'll be cool though. Well my mom wants to check her email, so I'm off.
