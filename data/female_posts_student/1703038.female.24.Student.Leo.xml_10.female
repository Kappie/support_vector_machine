For the record, I'm claiming it's from one of the countless potholes that spring up, lurk around corners, and give birth to baby potholes during the night after the snowplows peform their annual exfoliation of city streets,, but really it's because I was trying to read some assigned chapters for my graduate seminar tonight while I was driving.  I heard the BLAMCAJUNKCAJUNK that I've grown accustomed to since I began honing my shitty, tire bursting driving habits and pulled over at a gas station to assess the damage.  I was bent over in front of my wheel, simultaneously inspecting the tire for salvageability and shielding the general public from an intimate view of my ass crack when a brown paper bag wafted, American Beauty-style, down to the gravel in front of my feet.         I looked up--and up--at a behemoth, Saudi Arabia-old field-subsidizing SUV and its diminutive driver sloppily pouring a bottle of something grain alcohol related into a Sprite bottle.  Her hands were shaking so badly I saw the alcohol splash out of the bottle and onto her Casual Corner-issue fur lined jacket.  I caught her eye, and she stared at me through the smoked glass as she chugged the first third of her booze.  Her waay too trendy clothes and hairstyle screamed, "I'm forty.  I swear it!", but the dark spots on her hands put her at fifty, maybe more.  They looked even more burdened the enormous diamond rings slipping off her vodka splashed fingers. Her  eyes, carefully ringed in kohl and silver eyeshadow, were ancient and miserable.  Society wife gone wild.        She peeled away and nearly caught the same curb I did on her way out of the parking lot.   As I waited for Jay to come rescue me, I threw around the idea of calling her in for the police.  She had out of state vanity tags, so IDing the car wouldn't be any problem, but oh my God what if I ruined her life?  She could've been anyone...a CEO, a mother, a minister....what if she got all Law and Order-esque and killed herself after she got a DUI?  What if I saved her life?  What if I saved someone else's (my) life?  I know a lot of drunks; my grandpa, my old neighbors at the homeless shelter, but those guys were cariacutures of drunks--pink faced old guys with Old Fart trucker hats who would give me gum and quarters before that last six-pack of Schlitz kicked in and they passed out, or the guys who would puke in my lawn and night and clean it up before I left for work the next morning.  Alcoholism was funny--a story for the next day-- but this lady...  I called the cops on her, but the dispatcher seemed bored with it all and in the end I felt horrible.  My parents are chaperoning my brother's high school band's semi-annual pilgrimage to Walt Disney World, so when I called them about the tire they had to shout over some Epcot-related calliope music and they didn't understand what I was saying.  I think my dad thought I made a citizens' arrest and he said that was stupid.  My mom pushed her credit card on me for the tire and begged me to come home and attend sure-to-be-scandalous wedding in Neveda this weekend.  I left them to the Laser and Light Spectacular and sat moping at my computer about being broke and idealistic and misguided and and and...  Anyway, I think I'm blogging again.  (yay!)
