Yes, it is classified under 'rock', but there are different styles like 'classic rock' (e.g. Beatles), nu-metal (Rage against the machine), Hard rock (e.g. Guns N Roses), progressive rock (Pink Floyd). I also like quite a bit of 80's stuff, including classic 80's pop tracks.  Now, the common room......I reckon the days should be spilt over the two weeks and divided into 'sections'. One music 'style' should be played per day. One being Kiss radio, one being rock that the majority of the grungers like, and the other 'defined' styles like Rap, House, Garage, Living room, utility room, bedroom, front porch, larder storage, or whatever other music like that there is.  Splitting is the only fair way to control both sides. By me saying 'both sides' I mean Joe vs. Simon/Charlie vs. Rest of 6th form. (using as an example because they have two completely different music tastes).  Also. What struck me is....that music that is always being played gets turned off or changed. For example, that Pokemon song, nobody turned it off and it has been played three times that I have heard. I reckon nobody turned it off because it was a CHANGE. Something that nobody has heard for ages.
