No one that my brother knows has ever died, not a friends parent, not a friend, not a grandparent...nothing.  Now, he has to be pallbearer for his 19 year old best friend.  Our family is very, very close with theirs and everything is very confusing and scary right now.  My mother is a wreck because she is scared for my brother.  I am too.  Lately he's been hanging with the wrong people, smoking a lot of pot, speeding in excess of 100+ mph on the highway and totaling his car.  I hope this is his wake up call and not a push over the edge.  I hope he can right himself before he destroys himself.  I have never been more scared than I am right now.  Im scared that my brother is next and I can't even start to think or type or talk about what the consequences of that would be.    Peggy, the boy's mother, is devastated and rightly so.  She and my mom are very, very close and my mom just keeps crying and shaking because she doesn't know what to do to help Peggy in this time.  I'm scared for everyone around me and I feel like I don't want to do anything because I don't want to lose any of the time I have left with everyone.  I don't mean for this to sound dramatic and drama queeny, becuase its not meant like that.  For the last month I have been having these thoughts and trying to push them aside and I can't and all my thoughts are so morbid and I keep just going out so I don't have to sit home and think about losing these people.  I know I don't know what anyone goes through when something like this happens, becuase I've been fortunate to not have it happen to me, but it doens't make me less scared for you and scared to lose the people I love whether it be friends or family.  I don't like seeing people I care about hurt and I dont like not being able to help.  I dont want to push my way into your life to try and do what *I* think is gonna help you.  What do I know?  I've never been in your shoes, I couldn't even imagine if I tried.    The older I get the faster the time is going and the more people around me are starting to pass away.  Is this what a life is about?  Is life about watching all this time you could use to be effective wizz by you at some desk job and not taking advantage of it.  Is it about not letting people close to your heart so it will hurt less when you lose them?  No, of course its not, but to live the opposite way of that and let people in and try to not waste time is so scary.  I want to let you all know (and you know who you are) that I love you all very much and I cherish you all as friends and people and though we all make each other nuts sometimes its what makes us a family.
