I felt like I had been hickory smoked from the bonfire last night, so I got up and showered and went with my family to breakfast at Lumes. Then we went to some random places in Aurora. Yeah. And I stayed home and played the piano (which has been my addiction of late) and did some other stuff. Many congratulations go to Greg Maddux on number 300! Go Cubs Go!      Last song I listened to:   Losing Lisa  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   Rockin' The Suburbs .   Last meal I ate:  A cheeseburger.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I found some old band photos from 7th grade. Whoa.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Fired  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.
