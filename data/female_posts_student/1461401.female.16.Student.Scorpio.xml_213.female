At one point, there was a problem with my contacts, which made it seem like I was crying... (just trust me) The cinemaphotography was beautiful, and the story was really moving. But it really made me think. We are one of the most uncivilized nations. Honor, respect, discipline, and family are sacraficed for technological advances and commercial opportunities. And what of those that we presume to declare to be "uncivilized"? The ones that live simply.... but even as I write this, I force myself to wonder, what is the right way to live? The is no right answer, because all civilizations seem strange in the eye of a foreigner. Things that can seem right to one, can seem so barbaric to another. I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm too tired. But still, I'm glad I saw that. It reminded me that some of the most beautiful things in life are the most simple, like a cherry blossom in spring, or the way snow floats in winter. True signs of a truly great movie.  Have a good night.
