There's this part where this little boy draws on a Hitler mustache and then marches around the frontroom like Hitler. I started laughing my ass off! And last night I watched Freddy Vs. Jason. That movie is scary as hell. But it was really super good. Tonight I'm probably going to rent Honey or something else. I can't remember what all I wanted to rent. There were like a bunch but I didn't have enough cash on me. I need to save my money!!! Ugh poopey fish sticks. I have a hard time saving money. It's not something I'm good at. Anyways, I'll talk to you laters k? Love ya! *mwah*
