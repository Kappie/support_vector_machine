I'm still disappointed but we're all hoping that she can actually come here with her parents by next year. Her family is hoping that they can still petition her.  Anyhoo, I might give her a call when I visit Jeff this weekend.  I still need to buy a phone card.       Ching:  To my dearest webmaster thanks for helping me out once again with my blog!  I am still looking for a DDR game and dance pad for you! :) Hang in there!
