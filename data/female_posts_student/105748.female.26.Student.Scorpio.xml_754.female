Also a theme for my list of current crushes. *wink*wink*  The halloween party was a blast.  Ching and I got the "hot sisters" compliment a couple of times.  Woohoo!  I got acrylic nails put on for the occasion, and I still haven't cut 'em yet.  To be honest, I really actually like them.  It makes it really hard to hit the right keys on the keyboard though.  Ugh!  I wonder how I'll be able to work tomorrow.  Hmmm...
