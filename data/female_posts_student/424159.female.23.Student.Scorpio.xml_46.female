Christmas and New Year was fine, and I got to spend a good chunk of the holidays with my family.  I got a sweet fleece warm-up set, a gold necklace with a cool OSU charm, and a Boyd's Bear (The doctor one, of course).  A few of my relatives came from Pittsburgh for New Years, and the food was a plenty that night.  Later on, after us "kids" watched the Scooby Doo movie, I went to Shelley's and watched the ball drop on TV.  Not much, but it was cool.  It was back to school for me on Monday, the 6th, and I would like to say that I really didn't want to go back.    I find the stuff I'll learn in Physics class quite interesting, but there's that whole homework/class/study thing.  Oh well.  That's really all for now, so I'll check in when I find the time or when I find something else interesting to say.
