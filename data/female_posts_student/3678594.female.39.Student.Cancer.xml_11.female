I've been thinking a lot about my own use of meat and dairy analogues, mainly because I have a tube of  hamburger-style  GimmeLean in the fridge that needs using!  My cooking tends to be very simple. I seldom experiment with strange ingredients because I feed two children and I don't have money to waste on dishes they probably won't eat. Plus, I'm one of those rather boring folks who likes ordinary food. When it comes to the cuisines of other cultures, I am not embarrassed to admit that Mexican and Italian are about as exotic as I get. You won't find any tempeh, dried seaweed, lemon grass, or weird-looking mushrooms in my kitchen.  What you will find are dried and canned beans of all types, grains, pasta, potatoes, vegetables, and canned tomatoes. It doesn't sound exciting, but people are always amazed at the variety of recipes I can prepare with those ingredients. Occasionally, I do buy meat analogues, but they are expensive and tend to be more of a treat food. My favorite is Yves Ground Round and I can usually make a couple of dishes from one package.  I do buy soymilk regularly for cooking and baking, but when it comes to vegan cheezes, I make my own. I can't buy commercial vegan cheeze where I live and even if I could, I probably wouldn't. From what I hear, most of it doesn't taste very good. Fortunately, vegan cheezes are so easy to make at home. I tend to only make them once in a while though, and they, like the meat analogues, are treats. They make meals special.  Tomorrow, I will post a couple of my favorite recipes that use my favorite meat analogues. I hope you will enjoy them as much as we do!
