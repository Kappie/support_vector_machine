Soaring blithely, carelessly, having no limitations but the one string that is your lover who keeps you from floating away or burning up in the atmosphere and you feel free and tied down at the same time because you ARE free AND tied down at the same time.   I am constantly wondering if there are people who love me without feeling obligated. If I didn't have a family and I just lived alone would there be people I could say love me? I'm always feeling like there is no one who would hear my name and think "she is amazing". I wish I had that effect on people. I wish I was magnetic and it was easy to get lost in my eyes and that folks flocked to me for insight, comic relief, friendship, everything.   what brought on this sudden need for attention? Well it could be that my mom is out of town but I know the reason is because this morning I came into class and said "good morning" to two people, neither of whom responded. I felt kind of like a kicked puppy. Is this my fault? Did they have something else so important to think about that they couldn't reply, leaving me feeling so crappy? I would think that if someone was so engrossed in their own thoughts that they would be running into walls all the time, but stupid mason and stupid nate seemed to be moving about just fine with the exception of their most disgusting faux pas.   sorry, but I had to tell someone. I've hardly been so insulted in my life.  why was that "under god" issue all over the news again today? I think they should take it out, of course, simply because the US is such a mixed up place and it would be easier for everyone. The best way I've found of convincing my religious friends is by proposing that what if a Buddhist bribed the government into changing it and we all had to say "one nation, under Buddha". This seemed to sway them quite a bit.  today I went and saw the Johnny depp movie. It was quite disappointing.   while I was at the movies I saw a man and what appeared to be his mother. The sight of these two struck me as.... I don't know. The man was gawky and sad looking, his clothes didn't fit, and he had the air((err, ere, are, hair?)) of someone who had been falsely accused and stomped all over. It was quite scary how much I was affected by the sight of him, but I immediately felt like grabbing him and asking him what he needed, I pitied him, deeply. I assumed that he was being cared for by his mother, although he was maybe.... 30? Because of the way he walked so strangely beside her, like a child.   I think maybe I felt this way about him was because he looked like Rick. Or, at least, Rick the way I imagine him now. I never really talk about my ex-step-dad, he's more of a nasty detail of my past, a means to the end of the catastrophe my life is now built upon. He was a nice guy, Canadian, and always touting some silly joke or trivia question. He seemed so good. He was an RN and worked a lot, but always managed to find time for taking us out on the boat or "family night". Then there was the summer... We never saw him, we never saw momma, we just sat and festered, festered and were too young to realize what was happening. Then one day it was all over, out in the open, a concrete piece of our lives. I remember all of it so clearly. mammaw coming to the house, barging into the bedroom to find the shell that was my mother, then coming out later and asking "why didn't you tell me, caitlin?". I didn't tell you because I didn't know, mammaw. I had forgotten I had a mother, I only knew there were two people who lived in the bedroom where I hardly ever went, one was supposed to be at work and the other was a lady I missed very much. I would come visit her occasionally until one night when I found her in the bathroom. She didn't know who I was, and she peed on the floor. I never confronted her about it because I was so afraid, so hopefully she won't read this. And then I remember finding out what oxygenated was. Just some little tiny pill.    I ache for the way my life used to be. We lived in such a beautiful house, and we had three cats and a chihuahua and mom would always make chicken with rosemary I picked from her herb garden and we would go out on cross lake and innertube on our barge and then we would watch movies and play rummoli together and momma and Rick would always sit and drink coffee in the morning and play cribbage and there was a family of raccoons who lived in the back yard and would come eat the birdseed at night and I would watch them through the huge window in the living room. and my room was so wonderful. About a month before we filed bankruptcy and moved out my mom and grandmother had redone my room exactly the way I wanted it. It was so beautiful and it made me happy and I had my own room that was decorated and now I don't have my own room and it's NOT decorated the way I want it and it makes me sad.   so yes, folks, that is my sad story. I don't know why I felt the need to bring it up now, but after typing and crying for 20 minutes I feel much better about some stuff.   Rick took the chihuahua and the big screen TV and himself to Canada. I think he's still on drugs and he calls my mom sometimes, whining about how his life is terrible and he misses her and all this crap.   well that's about all the reminiscing I can handle for now. I will tell you something though... As far as catastrophes go, addictions and bankruptcy are the most often ignored and people try to forget them as quickly as possible. I say this because in my own selfish self-pitying whiny way, I feel wholly unfondled when it comes to the whole thing. Seriously, I had NO parents for 6 months and I had to leave my house and now we live with our grandmother and hate our lives and I don't even get a sorry and a hug? I guess it's just one of those things that will have to wait for my therapist. If I ever get a therapist... If my therapist doesn't need therapy after picking at my brain...  there is a whole bunch more stuff I wanna talk about. Like gateway and Italy and what I'm gonna do with my life, but it will have to wait because I'm sick of this computer screen and I would like to go watch Witch Hunter Robin and think about pointless philosophical stuff.
