Now that that’s out of the way let me briefly retouch on our AFI/Hannibal Lector debate.  I thought this was the greatest villain, not most original villain list?  I did not choose him because AFI did too, I simply mentioned they had.  Secondly, you may be trying a little too hard to be the anti-AFI.  Who cares who they list or don’t’ list and where, I don’t.  I believe films should be examined as the creators envisioned.  Some directors confine their visions to one film, some need three and for  The Matrix  I see the Wachowski’s vision being comprised of all three films, therefore I look at all three films as a whole.  It seems to me we agree- the first film was phenomenal, the second two were horrendous- but in your critique you’re willing to dismiss or overlook the lesser films, whereas I am not.  I’m not sure about “Agent Simth, one of the greatest villains ever.”  Yes, he’s good and Weaverings performance is delicious but he’s ultimately a computer program.  Smith doesn’t strike the terror in me of other villains because he’s only pretending to be human.  To me a great villain terrifies by exposing the evil that lurks in the hearts of all man.  Final note- you say no film had done more for cinema in the last fifteen years but I have two words for you,  Pulp Fiction !  For all the endless Charlie Kaufman/critic bashing I’ve taken, you lavish  Gladiator  on me as your last pick?  Joaquin Phoenix is a staggeringly gifted actor but his character is nothing more than a Roman poor little rich kid pissed off that daddy loves big brother more and the girl rebuffed him.  To me Russell Crowe’s true antagonist in the film is the oppression of slavery and his lingering sins of war.  Throw Joaquin into the ring with Lector and I’ll but my money on Hannibal every day of the week.  Before I move on to some general villain commentary I have I’ll let you respond.  I’m looking forward to your  Gladiator  retort.
