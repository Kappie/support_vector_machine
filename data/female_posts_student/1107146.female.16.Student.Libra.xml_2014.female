And it snowed at the beginning of the break, that's a sign of goodness. It's been sunny the last three years on the first day of break if I recall, and then there's a lot of gray and no tangible whiteness.   Tho I know my Western folk ain't looking forward to a White Christmas...that crazy bunch. I'm going there too, so bollocks to the snow, then.  Whatsay about whatever this weekend, Linds?
