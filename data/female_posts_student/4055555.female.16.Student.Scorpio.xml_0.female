You might not have noticed that people around you do it, maybe you just take it for granted that they do and consider it normal, but I don't. I consider it anything but normal. Try the wordANNOYING. I really only know two people that do this, and I hope I don't come across anyone else that does it... for their sake!   There's a girl in my year (I won't name names, let's call her 'Sandra') and she's been through alot this year. She's been engaged and she's suddenly changed from a wollyback to a scouser. Now nothing against scousers here because the two main contributors on this site will kick my ass. No seriously, I was born and bred in Liverpool so you could say I was one myself. My dad's pretty damn scouse too! Just I've known 'Sandra' (yes, put your twohands in the air, extend yourindex and middle fingers and bend themtwice [air quotes lol])since year 7 and she's always been a wollyback! I thought it was pretty weird when she started talking scouse one day! All it took was a liverpudlian boyfriend and 'Wham'... new accent! I've learnt to deal with it, but everyone's noticed and its too noticeably fake. Anyone who's in my year will know what I'm talking about.   And again... my sister. Her and her friends have this annoying American accent they use when they're with each other. ARGH it winds me up!I thought she might have grown up a bit since like 4 years ago, but it turns out I was wrong. Very wrong. Everytime I hear it I cringe! She sounds like a freaking cheerleader gone wrong. Blow my brains outplease. Does anybody else have friends or siblings that do this as well? I think it's just me :S   One circumstance I don't mind people putting on accents, is whenthey're doing an impersonation. Then it's just fun and cool! I'm personally not good at accents so if I'm doing an impersonation it tends to be in my accent (except for Bond and Arnie), so you won't hear an accent that's not mine too often lol.   Phew there's a ton and a half lifted off my chest!
