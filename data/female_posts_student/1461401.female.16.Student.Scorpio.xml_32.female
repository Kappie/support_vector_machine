       
      I may stay up all night tonight. I may wander throughout the days in a sleepless sort of fuzz. I may just walk away one day, without saying a word, and it will be all your fault. No one ever fights for what they believe in anymore, they just leave things be, hoping that they'll fix themselves. No one would care though. They would just assume I'd come back one day. Everyone just assumes I'll be back one day. But they never try to look for me.  Now there's something to think about.
