Well....until the Cubs game it was. I don't think I can bring myself to watch the game. I want to...but, maybe I'll only watch the 9th inning haha.   Anyway, I went out to lunch today which was nice, well...not really out to lunch , over to Matthew's. That was...interesting but we wont talk about that. Oh, and I managed to get food from people. I asked both Brandon and Peter to make me a biscuit when they were in senior foods...and they did! I was like...YAY! Food!  Oh...REALLY scary experience for the day though. I'm sitting on the steps in the band room before school this morning waiting to go in since we had to be there early and...I didn't even play but that's not the point. Anyway, I'm sitting on the stairs with a bunch of people innocently drawing with the erasable crayons Kelly has which are AMAZING which also isn't the point and Peter, who was sitting across from me gets up, and like, two minutes after that Kelly was like..."Ummm, what IS that?" And we all look, and there's this huge cockroach. Right on the stairs where Peter was sitting. It was the GROSSEST thing I've ever seen. Then...Greame came in and tried to smush it, and we all thought it was dead, and...I was still extremely grossed out, but at least I thought it was dead.  THEN, sixth hour, I come back in the band room, and Elizabeth and I took a look at it and realized it's little legs were STILL moving. These things are like...immortal. But.....ewww. It was creepy. So, we get Greg Freeman to come try to squish it with his shoe, which he does surprisingly and we hear this loud crack and....EWWWW. I swear I'm going to have nightmares tonight about cockroaches. So grody.  But yeah...after explaining all that I have to go eat dinner now. More later perhaps. Perhaps not?
