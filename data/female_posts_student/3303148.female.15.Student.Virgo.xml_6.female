For one, most the blogs that I go to are fucked up in some way or another. My  urlLink greatestjournal  layout is messed up with weird borders, and the friend's page only loads about halfway down the visible screen, and then just stops... with no scroll bar or anything, and this weird border around it. And this journal won't even load at all.   I do have this thing though, where you have the option of viewing the page with IE, so that's what I do for those pages.  And it has this client for livejournal/greatestjournal that really rocks my socks.  So I think that I will stick with  urlLink FireFox , and just complain to them about my pages. They are sure to fix it if I do that!  --------------------------  In other news, it is almost one o' clock in the morning, and my ex-boyfriend just accidently called (I think he must of sat on his cellphone or something).  My mom got on the phone and thought (since I was on the line) that it was me calling from somewhere else (she was already asleep when I got home), and was all confused.  That made my night a little less boring.
