It was annoying, but oddly fascinating when the event actually started.  Way too crowded, way too many people, way too hot, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Weird!  What's even more peculiar are the fighter jets flying by my neighborhood...boy do they cause a ruckus.    I hope everyone enjoys whatever they do today...be it with family or nothing at all.  But the sky will be on fire, and that's something to look forward to...even if they get boring oh so fast.
