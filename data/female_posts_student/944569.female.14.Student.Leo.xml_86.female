Dead, i say!   Why, why do you do this to me cruel world?  Have i done something wrong?   All month, NOT ONE GODDAMN GOOD THING has happened to me!   Why is it so, Fate?  Lies have always been the enemy.   Lies are always lurking under the skin of a liar.  Lies, lies.  They have nipped, pestered and attempted to ruin my life many times before.   But, why now?  Why?  They've torn apart my life, reputation and will to live!   What else do they want from me?  Is this truly a sign for me to kill myself?   Over and over again.  Thoughts of Death haunt me!  I want to die.   My reputation is spoiled my life, impure.  Death, death.  Blood, blood.   A splash of crimson paint on a wall and smoking gun in a dead hand.   Better yet, a hand hanging limply over a bed with blood trickling ever so slowly into pools on the floor.   Cuts and slashes on a mutated corpse bearing but a bloodied kitchen knife and a smile.
