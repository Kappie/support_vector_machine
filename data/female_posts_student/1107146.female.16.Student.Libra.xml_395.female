Heavy meds, lots of freaking out, and a world of pain...whereas we figured you'd never come back, but you did so yay :).   I'm on drugs right now. If any of you wants to borrow anything or tell me exactly how they feel about me, now is the time...I won't remember jack. The fever's down cuz of more acetominophen (I would say Tylenol but...I'm taking Brand-X acetominophen) so that buzzing "monsters are eating my insides" feeling is down for now.  BROOKS WILL NOT STOP CALLING. What part of "FUCK OFF YOU FUCKIN' FUCK" doesn't he understand...and that's a direct quote, by the way, with all the will my dying throat could muster. ARGH. So if he calls again I'm going to invoke the sacred rites of Yog Sogoth, Black Goat with 1000 Young and have them eat his soul, yippee!  And I found the greatest game in the world to play while hallucinating. It's called  Meeklits , from the creators of  Snood . Anyway, it's really annoying at first, until you experiment a bit and figure it all out. And then it's even more annoying. But somehow it's a great game. I was reminded of the word "smertastic" while playing it, for some reason. Again, I'm blaming the 'Quil.  But anyway, going to listen to some Jerry and see if I can't calm down a little. The song  Pro False Idol  by this man is quite possibly the most beautiful song I have ever heard.
