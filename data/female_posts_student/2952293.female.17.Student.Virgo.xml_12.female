And you know, this is a really buff guy, but he's so nice and always saying "if it's too difficult, just modify it. You'll be okay" Well Ms. Standley, is quite different than our good friend Billy Blanks. She made us sprint, do jumping jacks, and so on. That's all fine and dandy, but we hardly did the kickboxing part. And she was all "PUSH IT YOU LARD ASSES!" Well she didn't say that, but man she wanted us to move. It was really funny.  After school, I went to Meghan's, cause as I said before, we were going to go see Junior Revolution. When we got inside, I had like 15 bags, and I ran into a chair, that was funny. Then we were doing some homework, and while she was walking her dog, I tried to print my spanish homework, but the pages never came out and I thought I broke the printer. Turns out, you have to pull out the tray so the paper can come out. OOPS! As we were leaving, Meghan completely wipes out on the steps in the garage, I mean wipes out! She had to be in so much pain, but I couldn't stop from laughing.  We headed to Cosi before the conert. Okay, don't go to the Polaris Cosi, it's messed up. We had a really bad waitress and there was this guy and girl humping in front of one of their families, it was gross. And you know how there are paintings on the wall? Well, this one lady comes over and is standing right in front of our table looking at the paintings. Then she was talking to her daughter, and she thought I was the artist, because I was the one sitting by it and she goes, "Oh look, she's shy!" WHAT THE HELL LADY?! Chelsea from Westerville South does NOT live by the painting, therefore there is a chance that I might not be the artist! The food was really greasy too, and I had a stain on my shirt that looked like poop. It was gross. Then we headed towards Midgard. I was singing to "Hey Mickey" or whatever and having some fun. So we enter, and there are literally five people there. We stood against the wall as the first band finished, and then we spotted the guys from J Rev! It was really exciting. Meghan kept telling me to go over there, but I couldn't. This girl went and tried to talk to them, and they completely shut her down, so I was worried that they would do the same to me. When she finally got the hint and left, we walked over there, and my heart was racing. I don't know why, I just get really nervous. But we did, and they were really nice. We only really talked to Chris (the drummer) and Brian (the bassist), oh yeah and the merch guy. They were really nice and we talked about their show with Something Corporate, and where they were from, and of course we talked about CSG, cause that's basically my entire life's purpose. I told them I was the girl that had been e-mailing them like 7,000 times, in reality twice, and they remembered. We also talked about my two difficult tests the next morning. That was exciting. They signed my concert shirt, and I let the merch guy as well, but the guy who looks like Bob the Bachelor was kind of mean. But I still got the autograph. So Chris says he's from Akron, and oh god I don't know why, but... I asked if he had heard of the Oliver Ocasek building!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH no I know! Oliver Ocasek is my late great uncle and he used to be President of the Ohio Senate. I  couldn't think of anything to say so that's what I said! He looked at me, said no, and the conversation pretty much ended. So after another band we thought and hoped that J Rev would be next. I asked Brian, and he said that there was still another band to go. Well I'm sorry, but I had two tests the next day and we had to be home by 10! It was like 9 and there was no way in hell we'd see them. Brian was really nice and he kept coming over and apologizing that we wouldn't be able to see them and that they didn't know all the other bands were going to take so long. So then we talked a lot more, and I made a fool of myself some more times. We talked about having them play at Senior Day, hem hem class 05, this is a really good idea. Even Meghan likes them, so they'll play, okay that's settled. While we were talking, I was really pissed that the band setting up wouldn't go faster, and Brian goes, "Geez you're ready to just kick them off stage" and I was like "Well, sometimes I get a little aggressive!" It's true, I have about as much patience as I don't know, somebody without patience. He kept trying to talk about what they were doing, but apparently I kept going back to hanging out with Something Corporate. I'm sorry, I just love them. So the band Soma begins to play. Oh dear, they're weird. The lead singer is about 35, with a full beard and bald spot. The guitarist looks like he's been ripped out of the Darkness video, and the keyboardist is either wearing the best bell-bottoms ever created, or a long denim skirt. Either way, I just don't know. The singer was really annoying and looked out into space and couldn't concentrate. Then he went outside, with the mic, and was like "What the fuck are you doing outside? Don't you know Soma's playing!?" Then he came in and entertained us all with his magical flying middle fingers and his constant badgering of us all by calling us "maggots". Thanks, I really support you Soma. Actually, it was really funny.  Half way through their performance, we had to leave. It was really awkward, cause I didn't know if I was supposed to say goodbye to Brian, since he was standing next to us, or not. So we did. He apologized to us and gave us a hug and then we left. Oh and he told us to get home safely. It was nice. And Meghan was like "he likes the brown flava" but I thought she said "he likes the brown Frida". You know that Spanish woman Frida something, who looks like  man? I thought she was saying I looked like a man, but she wasn't and it was just funny.  So we didn't get to see them play, but it was neat to talk to the band, and I told them I would be there Columbus spokesperson, and they were weirded out but whatever! P.S. Brian told me that Will left Something Corporate, so I promptly called Elizabeth.  When we got back to Meg's, I noticed a nice couple of skid marks she left on the stairs from her fall and I laughed, a lot. Then we watched this horrible Primetime about Colorado City and theif ass prophet who makes 15 year olds marry like 40 year olds. It was foul. Then we laughed in bed for a long time. And the next morning I kept hovering over Meghan to get her up.  Today was pretty boring, people were mean to me, and p.s. SENORA pryor, stop being a bastard to me, cause we all know that you want to have sex with all your students you perv. I hate you. And your kids are ugly. So just never speak again, thanks bye.  Well I will be attending the school play tonight. Hope my friends do a great job, I know they will!
