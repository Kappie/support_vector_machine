Most of the time I feel like second best, or third. With the exceptions of a few people, like Kelly and Emily for example. Yeah, they're best friends, but they ALWAYS make me feel like I'm just as important to both of them as they are to each other. But, then there's some people who seem to always make me feel like I'm not good enough. Like, "oh, I guess we'll call you after we make sure everyone else isn't busy." Argh. It's just not cool. I try to ignore it, but it's difficult. Oh well..just...a though.  XOXO
