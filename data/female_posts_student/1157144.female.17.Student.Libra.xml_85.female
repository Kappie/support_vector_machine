I had a really freaky night yesterday. I kept waking up in the middle of my sleep and thinking that I was with someone, or rather, someone was in my bed with me.  It was really freaky. Of course, no one was there, but it just kept happening. I was trying to figure out if I was dreaming it, and then got the spiritual world mixed up with the real one after I woke up. But then I wonder- what was I dreaming about? I remember one dream I had, Billy had the spoon, but we went to some park with a pond, and he put his spoon in the water and it inflated to the size of his head. That was a comical dream... But there's no way I was thinking about *that* when I thought someone was in my bed. *shivers* It still freaks me out somewhat!
