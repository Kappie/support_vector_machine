What really doesn't make sense is - They give you a list of food to eat during the recovery stage and then when you tell them, you actually followed it and foods didn't bother you. They give you that "oh you've been eating to many carbs?" - What the fuck? You told me to eat that shit. So don't you sit there and point the fucking finger at me and make me feel like a HUGE screw up, once again when it comes to weight loss.  The other thing that makes no sense at all -- How different doctors are when it comes to eating foods after surgery. How can one doctor say "Yeah, go ahead and eat blah blah!" but yet this doctor over here says "No, that will make your stomach huge... blah blah!" - It makes no sense to me at all, they all just preformed the same surgery - shouldn't it be the same diet also? Strange.  Anyways, everyone keeps telling me how proud they are - My mom, Grandma, Online dad, Josh, Tonya.... but yet why don't I feel proud of myself yet? I wish I know this answer.
