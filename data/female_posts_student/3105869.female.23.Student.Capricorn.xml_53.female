"Something is going on that you don't know about -- but you can sense it. You know it. It's hard to tell if there is actually someone out there who is working to undermine what you say, or if this is more of a psychological issue where you are your own enemy and cannot see this at all. Take a hard look at how you are moralistic, for others may be rebelling to that, rather than to the relevance of your ideas. Reevaluate how you make your points, but not the essence of your individual ideas." also by Rick Levine, AOL
