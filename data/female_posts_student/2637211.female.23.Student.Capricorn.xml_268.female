Then after taking Catherine to Delta College to get herself enrolled and take her assessment test, I spent the afternoon yakking with my dad and Neb. It was really nice and nostalgic, and I'm glad to see Dad and Neb making the house a home.  In related news, the cats are driving me bonkers. Judy is such a wimp! She won't defend her food against the kitten (I'm thinking Estella now...) and she won't just put the cat in her place. It's getting really frustrating, because I really want Judy to eat. Ack!
