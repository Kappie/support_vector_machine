I hope everything is okay there and that you're okay!  Easter was okay, not much to report about that.  Life has just been keeping me busy with school coming to it's close for the spring semester.  Hopefully I'll pass everything and do well on all my finals!  Not much to say, except that I can't wait for OCTOBER to get here...ah the longing for  Incubus Dreams  by Laurell K. Hamilton!  I am going to go absolutely crazy before then!!!!!  I can't take it, I'm just not that patient!  ~Kristyn
