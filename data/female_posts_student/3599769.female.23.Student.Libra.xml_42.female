See, me and him were never really close, and now all of a sudden he is going to live a couple of doors away from me. (I moved to my grma's house when he was in 5th grade) He just called me, seems all of a sudden I'm invited to his party tonight at the new place and seeing as I'm the only one legal enough to buy the drinks if I'd mind stopping at the liquor store and picking him up something. Go figure!  But thats okay, he doesn't know the wrath of his big sis's depression. LOL. Late nights at his place to keep me busy should be fun.
