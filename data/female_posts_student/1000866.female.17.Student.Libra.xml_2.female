I sat alone on the bus again! Yay, go being alone on the bus! Umm, I didn't get to finish my EPVM homework before school because Mr. A wouldn't let us in. What a poopeyhead. Anyway, yeah, I ended up just reading  There Are No Children Here . Great book, I'd suggest reading it. Depressing though. So, when we finally got in there, I was like, "All right! I still have time to do homework," but then Nathan's like, "We're still having sectionals." Now you see, we have four people in our trumpet section for jazz because one quit, and one of the kids in the section didn't show up, so our sectional consisted of Nathan, Tom, and I just playing randomly. Oh fun! Nathan kind of forgot to give Alstadt his keys back after opening one of the practice rooms, and took them to math with him. I had to go find him, and get the keys from him. His math teacher kind of glared at me, but oh well. At least I missed warming up in WE. So, yeah, I tried doing the homework in WE, but of course there was Dan, Dave, Peter, and Don being mean...shock shock. At least Matt's a nice kid. So, we played this song in WE (Wow, we played music in music class, woo!) and there was this one part that only 3rd and 4th trumpet play, and I was trying to play it right, but Dan was playing it wrong, and he was sitting next to me, so it's hard not to go with what he's doing.. So...we probably both messed up, and it just didn't combine well, but of course...I was the one who got yelled at for it. Oh well. I'll seek revenge on them someday. We talked about transposing in Music Theory, fun stuff, and they actually said that I'm too hard on myself. I thnk I'm not hard enough on myself. Moving along...EPVM (Nap time!) we talked about past tense, and whatnot. Very boring stuff. Umm, gym...heh, whoops, forgot gym shoes, oh well, it happens. So, I read all period. Math...ok, I was determined not to answer. I don't like answering in that class...but, most of my class...arg...dumb as rocks. It's really obnoxious. I'm not saying I'm an Einstein, but really people...so, I was finally forced to succumb to the evil math devil, and I answered. My math teacher is...well, to say the least a bit boring. Mr. Madsen...eek. Even the name is boring. Oh well...umm, lunch..watched Kelly beat Brett at chess...It was interesting. Comparative Religions was good as usual, and science was...boring, as usual. Talking to Alex and Joanne now.They're really cool kids. Alex put me in his profile...he's back on my nice list. :) Anyway...jazz after school was interesting, but gosh darnit!! I am SO bad at improv Why? I'm probably making it a lot harder than it should be, but...I'm just not the most outgoing person when it comes to playing my trumpet. I was told by a clarinet player that I have a small head, and you know good trumpet players. They all have really big heads, that of course meaning egos. So...possibly I just should have picked flute. Oh well...we just found out we're supposed to have jazz combo on Tuesday's. I had no idea, and already had plans I couldn't cancel, so...now I feel awful for leaving them. Sorry guys...but yeah, I ate dinner, had a lesson, and now here I am...pondering the meaning of life...no not really, but oh well. Nothing more to write now, possibly more later....possibly... ~Ya di amore~
