It's hard to tell after simply two paragraphs, but the style of the piece and the use of an obscure African proverb are pretty good clues a la Ginzburg about where it was heading. Save two of us, myself included among the two, no one could understand the selection as it was written in pretentious academic prose, the kind all of us should be aiming for. One classmate claimed that she never wrote like that and had no intention of ever doing so. I replied, "You just need more professional development."  Is it strange that the entire class found this funny but that no one else outside of graduate students in the liberal arts will ever see the humor in this? Is my mind expanding or contracting as I further my education?
