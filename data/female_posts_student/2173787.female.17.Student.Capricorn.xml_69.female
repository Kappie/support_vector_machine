Today my grandfather got new hearing aids and for the first time in my lifetime I didn't need to shout to be heard.  Its odd, it has become a habit to raise my voice when he is in the room, more often than not the only way he knows that a conversation at the table is occurring is by the fact that our lips move, but tonight he could listen to me and recognize that Lucky was barking in the garage. Sweaters and jewelry are nice, but they just don't really compare, especially in light of recent news/speculation...But I don't feel like downing my mood so I'll possibly go into that later.  Happy Holidays!
