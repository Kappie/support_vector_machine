I'm really sad I'm not going to the BBQ or the Luke race but I think I'm going to go to say one of the Wagner Cancer thingy I'm not sure yet. Blah.. yeah... it's really late and I'm really tired but I don't want to go to sleep I want to go out and party or dance or something. Adrenaline is flowing for some reason. It's starting to simmer down now thought but still.. maybe if I read a bit.. that usually does the trick.  So yeah... Notre Dame and Florida is so close now. Like... I can't wait to see Mick and I can't wait to see the Vistana Crew again. What I find amazing is that I was so happy to be leaving and going tons of places this summer but I kinda wanna stay home now. I wanna stay and spend the summer with everyone. Ug... I still have finals. I was supposed to send the Religion Review to Gabby, I'll do it when I wake up. x0x
