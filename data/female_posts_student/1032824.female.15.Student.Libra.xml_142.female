There are days you feel so listless, sad, worried and guilty all at the same time. There are some days when you wish you havent said what you have said, but all these cant be undone since you have said those words. Well, yesterday was  the day  for me.  Right now I'm feeling kinda flustered and tired. Much better than yesterday though, because Martini sms-ed me (shan't disclose the details of message for privacy purpose). It made me feel relieved.   Training yesterday. Training today. Meeting the principal Mr Haaannngg for a meeting tomorrow with the NCOs * gulps *. Test tomorrow. Test on thursday. Training on friday. Tuition on friday. Heh! What a week. I can't wait for saturday. History lessons. Chairperson workshop. Training. JJC Love Fiesta. Marche with the chicks. Wooyeah.
