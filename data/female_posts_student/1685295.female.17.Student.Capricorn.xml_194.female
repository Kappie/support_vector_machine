Really - sadly, the most lovable thing around right now. (For those of you fellow aficionados - and by that, I mean *geeks* - I was watching I, Borg and Descent part I and II.)  He's a little mechanical but he's so *sweet*. . . .Of course, LadyN and I are still the (apparently) conjoined lesbian couple of the hour, but who knows?  If we discover warp drive maybe things will change. ^_^  Talent show was awesome, lots of noise, lots of fun.  We're Allan's groupies!!  His band kicked serious ass, by the way, as did Quentin and Hadrien in their band.  And sadly sadly . . . .white/chinese/whatever people really, just, can't dance.  *sigh*  Peace love and cockatoos!
