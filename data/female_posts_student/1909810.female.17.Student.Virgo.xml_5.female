I went there today feeling all lonely and depressed and such, and after we started doing stuff I was happier :) we had to pair up for an activity thing and it's nice not having to be the one that is forced to say "I don't have a partner"...that may sound corny...but it's nice. And also small groups have formed, just because that happens in large groups of people, and it's nice to be in a group although I don't talk much. And speaking of not speaking much, I am determined to fix that somewhat, hopefully, at least a  little . I'll try (even though I say that  all  the time).  Whatever.   School makes me sad. Grades are awful things. I think I'll be giving up my 4.0 this year, except that I'm taking AP classes so that might help, but I might have to force myself to say good bye to my straight A's.  Maybe that will be a good thing for me. Maybe I can release some of this unneeded anxiety that I have and just say screw it. I need to remind myself that colleges don't just look for grades but for involvement in things, and I'm involved...somewhat. Anyways, goals for me:  (1)Get over myself and stop being shy. (2)Get rid of the anxiety that seems to be having a large affect on my moods.
