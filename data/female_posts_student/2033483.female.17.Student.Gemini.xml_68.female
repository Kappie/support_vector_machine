She said, "Choose a career that you want and one that will make you happy.  Don't choose something just to make money, because if you do it that way, you'll never be happy."  No one has ever told me that before, especially not a teacher, but it stuck with me and kept playing over and over again in my head on the way home.  I know I've called Mrs. Leistra a homework nazi before but that advice meant a lot, I think it was because no one has ever told me that before.    I read through Lizzie's blog this afternoon and the ten things she has listed on it are so enlightening.  I only wish I could have written it.  Check it out: http://www.dibbledaduck.blogspot.com/  Graduation Good-bye: (to the people that I think read this)  Brad: You're right, we've had our ups and downs through the last two years, but I'm really glad that we're leaving each other on good terms.  Overall, it's been good.  You were there for me last year when my grandfather died when a lot of my friends didn't know how to be.  So for that, I'm eternally grateful.  The college that you're going to sounds like it's a nice one.  You may be three states over but I'm positive the internet still works there so make sure to still instant message me.  I want to stay caught up.    Lexi: or is it Lexi LeVanArkel? What do I say to my editor-in-chief?  I always did take you more seriously than Chris.  You're a very intelligent hardworking person and I know that you want to be a news anchor and I have no doubt that you can do it.  It's too bad that you aren't able to do the TV stuff with us next year.  Don't worry, Brianna and I talked about it after history on Wed. and we decided next year we are going to make the paper the best.  Be sure to visit!  Logan:  You have a way of making things more fun.  I have to thank you for never giving me attitude like Mollie and Bri did.  Even though their was some sorta plot to kill me....I'm gonna miss you next year.  You're also an intelligent hardworking person so whatever you decide to do I'm sure you'll be very good at it.  You also be sure to visit!  Joe: It was really nice to get to know you year. This is particularly relevant to Mrs. Leistra's advice. You've showed me that it's okay not to go to college and it's okay to follow a dream. I do like The Spill Canvas and I truly do want you guys to succeed. Kick ass at CBGB!  Be nice to the teeny boppers lol!  God Bless, Kayla
