I think you have been such a hard worker in bringing all these tips to stay on fire for GOD!  i felt inspired today to inform you that GOD is pleased, and so are we.  You are so creative and you've been an inspration and a positive sister.  May you understand your power and the messages you share only adds jewls to your crown.  "reach people through your acts of kindness"  Thank you!    I would like to suggest the next book.  The Purpose Driven Life by: Rick Warren this is a self help book. zyhre difference between this book and the rest is all the other books tell you to find your purpose within your self, but this book tells you search your creator, and his reason for creating you.  It helps you understand God's plan for you!  It's a fourty-day journey, but it know to change lifes.   One love, and may peace be in your heart. Rose-Laure
