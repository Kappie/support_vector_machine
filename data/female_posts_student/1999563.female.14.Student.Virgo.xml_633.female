Then I get back and I only have one day then I go to my other camp! Crazyy.  Today I got way to much  sleep  so hopefully I will be able  to  fall asleep tonight.  Karsens coming over today!! Woohoo! She is going to  spend  the night then  we  are going to camp together.  I  wonder  what  dorm place we are staying  in.   There are two dorm  halls  on the Warner campus. One is like Smith hall or something. Then the other one is Warman Hall,  named  after my grandpa! That would be funny if we stayed there.  Well...I can't think of much else to say.. uhh ...bye!
