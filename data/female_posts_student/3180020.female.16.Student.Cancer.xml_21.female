We went shopping at JC Penny's and spent 227 bucks!! lol....then we went and ate at BV and so a total hottie *or so Cretia says* lmao! *wink wink* I gotta tell *you* about some stuff she said about you....but anyway.....then we went to walmart and bought a buncha crap but we forgot to buy our 2 liter drinks for the band banquet.  so we stopped at the chevron and bought some....then we went to her house and showed her mom everything.  I really miss seeing her everyday! she's my big bitch sister, and I'm not complete without her! I'm gonna be all nice and shit when she's gone off to school! OH DEAR...the thought is scary....lol....Not really, I think Im generally a nice person! Maybe Im totally crazy for thinking that, but I don think so.  Im prolly gonna get some bad news her in a few minutes if *someone* will get off the damn phone!!!!!! who knows! I hope this doesn't turn out like I think its going to! Talk To Yall Later! holla.....1
