Here is my take on the subject...When I go to a movie, I want to be uplifted, cheered up, I want it to make me smile...you know, get warm fuzzies and  all that jazz , so I like the characters to be pretty...or handsome - respectively - I want them to be nearly perfect...you know, funny, cute, happy-go-lucky people. Their interactions during the movie, the feelings...love, happiness...stuff like that...I want that stuff to make me smile, I want it to take away my worries for an hour and a half. But you see, there are many other ways of looking at this subject...one of which is to approach it thinking that you want the movie to make you feel better about yourself and your life. The characters are not perfect, pretty...they don't have the characteristics that make them people of great interest. It makes you think, wow, I've got it pretty good. But see, even these movies sometimes don't make my life look good...lol. Sometimes, I just want to see a good comedy, or a romance...put myself in the heroine's shoes, get to know what it would be like to be in love, to be so happy that nothing could go wrong...and even if things did go wrong that I could rewind and start over, or just wait for my  happily ever afte r ending! Yeah, sometimes, I just wish things were like they are in the movies. Sometimes I just want that perfectly timed kiss under the stars, or even just the warm hand...fingers laced with mine...ok, so now you're thinking... o great she's getting all mushy ...sorry, I'll stop, I just wish it could happen to me ya know? LoL. Goodnight. ~BS
