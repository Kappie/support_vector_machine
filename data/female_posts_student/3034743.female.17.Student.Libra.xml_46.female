I'm getting SUPER excited about prom! It is going to be so much fun! Well, I hope so anyways. Hmm....what else did I do today? Oh yeah, I talked to Josh. I told him that I wasn't really ready for a boyfriend, and he seemed to be okay with that. So that is good. We're still gonna be friends tho, so that's cool. Not much else happened today. That was really about it.
