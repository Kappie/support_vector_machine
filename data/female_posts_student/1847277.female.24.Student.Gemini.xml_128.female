The bones continue to be bones.  I've coded over 1200 now, which is making pretty good progress.  I have two more weeks before I leave for London, and then a few days after that it's off to Kenya.  It's a little scary but will hopefully be good.    Given my easy access to the internet here, it's going to be quite a shock to dive back into lack of communication land.  I hope I can deal without too much trouble (like the withdrawal I went through last year!).  I was actually okay in Montenegro, although it is so nice to actually be able to be in touch with people on a regular basis.  Yes, I know I'm a communication freak, but what can I say, I like people.  (Okay, I don't like the general public most of the time, but I love my friends.)  Time to end this lame-o post and get to work...
