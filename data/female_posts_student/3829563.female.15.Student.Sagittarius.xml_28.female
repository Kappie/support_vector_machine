I think im going to go read up about it, and start taking pictures on my own. like, why not? hilary, wanna be my model? heh.. no, really though, hey anyone, if u want me to take pictures of you, here's your lady. right here. ill do it. just not any nude ones. my virgin eyes....   oh my, am i ever smart. what the hell is wrong with me anyway. i seem to be leaning onto the arts side of life. which isnt wrong but it wasnt exactly my intention in life. i still want to be a psychologist. god this is annoying. do photographers earn a lot? maybe I'll get like a really nice camera, live in LA, and be some psyhotic orlando bloom fan, follow him around, taking pictures, and then selling them. like why not? sounds fun. get to earn some money. fuck im weird. and now im looking for places to get my eyebrows waxed. you know ive always wanted to be in front of the camera and stuff. well i guess thats what everyone wants but im thinking maybe im better behind the camera..  okay, im definetly weird. im going to go get some milk now. goodbye.
