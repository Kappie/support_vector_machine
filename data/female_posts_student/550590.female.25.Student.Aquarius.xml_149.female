Monday-I was supposed to teach in Dr. Swett's class but things got to hectic, had the 2nd-to-last session with a client I've been counseling for 8 months run overtime and realized there was no way in hell I was going to get everything on my "to-do" list done by Friday, so I said screw it and skipped class (the ghosts of rehab past rear their ugly heads.) Come to find out, everyone else who was supposed to be there skipped it, too. Sorry, Dr. Swett! To my defense, she didn't let me know until the week before when her class was and I had already scheduled sessions that day. Otherwise, I probably could have made it. Had dinner with Tina at Nero's Monday night. It was nice to catch up. You know it's been a while since you've seen someone when they're like "wow, you have hair!" Sigh.  Tuesday-my farewell luncheon at the Sheriff's Office. In a classic ASO gesture, hardly anyone I actually work with showed up. Only 1 of my current interns, but 3 of my teen court volunteers which was so nice. Props to Jason, Vicky, Amanda, Jing, Yan, Scott, Bruce, Jill, Kris, Lt. Fundenburg, Sgt. Gerard, Mr. Sam Stafford, Cindy, John Richman, and Lauren for the fancy plaque. You all know how I love my trophies. Tuesday night was...I don't really remember Tuesday night. Like I said it was a crazy week. Oh, yeah, and it was also Sharemah's birthday.  Wednesday was a day to begin tying up loose ends. Not much exciting happened that I recall. Just getting ready for the week to end and beginning to pack up my office. You know, a pack rat like me can accumulate a lot of shit working at the same place for almost 3 years...especially after they gave me an office with a door. I think today was the only day I actually got to have lunch with Bruce. I also terminated with that client I mentioned. He gave me a plant because I "helped him grow." I told him he helped me grow, too. Then to demonstrate what a grown up I am, I bleached and put bright red highlights in my hair! :)  Thursday was an emotional train wreck. It was my last Teen Court, so my dad was the judge which was kind of cool. I know he got a kick out of my having to call him "Your Honor" all night. :) The kids made me cry. They brought me presents, gave me lots of hugs and made speeches about me. I hate to quote bad movies but "They gave me candy and called me the light." Only unlike in Dangerous Minds I didn't stay. They made me cry and all gave me a big group hug which only made me cry some more. I love my attorneys. I have lots of thank you notes to write. Then we had our end of semester dinner at Rigatelli's. The dinner wasn't great, but the company was. In addition to all my interns (minus Amanda who went to Melting Pot instead--can't blame her), my dad came, Elizabeth B., Maggie, Jill, Jason and Lauren of course, Lauren brought John, Gretchen brought Seth, Adrian brought Katrina, and "Mom" brought "Dad". We gave Lateria her Mommy-to-be gift and Adrian sang "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" and made a lovely speech.  Friday was total madness. I don't even remember what I did on Friday. Lauren and Jason took me to lunch at Cafe Gardens for Sweet Potato Fries, which was a nice change from Taco Bell and Publix grocery lunches I'm used to. Then I had to finish up with all my counselors, do their exit interviews, do their end-of-semeter paperwork, have my exit interview with HR, run around and turn in my pager, keys, IDs, and get a bunch of forms signed. "Have you turned in your glock?" I chickened out on the exit interview and decided to write it instead. I wanted time to let things sink in and really think about the good of the program before I answered any of the questions on that form in detail. So Friday was a rough day, but I'm still happy about my decision to leave. Friday night Bruce and I went to Books-A-Million and blew the gift card Gretchen got me as a farewell gift (I really should leave jobs more often!) and also bought Harry Potter trading cards which have become our new obsession.  Saturday was the day Maggie came home, but the adventure of getting her was a story in and of itself...  So Bruce's car makes a lot of noise...all the time. But we're driving down 34th street and we're like "is it me, or does the car sound noisier than usual today?" So instead of stopping to check it out, we thought it would be mroe productive to mimic the sounds the car makes instead. Until we got to the mall and the car started making really loud noises and bumping along the road. We pulled into the Mall parking lot and Bruce's car had "pulled a firestone". So seeing as neither one of us had ever changed a tire before (memories of Josh Heller changing the tire on my car at the airport in Jax at 1am after DSR our Freshman year) and that Bruce's spare was buried under all my stuff from moving, floating in some odd liquid and was rusted, it took us an hour and a half to change the damn tire. So we got to Petsmart about 20 minutes before the animals for adoption were going home for the week, found Maggs and fell in love with her aat first sight. The rest of the night was spent hanging out and playing with our new kitten and preparing ourselves for my move.  So that was my last week in Gainesville in a nutshell. It was totally crazy and I'm sure I've left a bunch of stuff out, and I'm sorry if you're reading this and I left you out personally, but at this point everything is still a blur. I think I still think I'm just on vacation and at some point I'll have to put on my suit and head for the courthouse.  More about life in Orlando after I finsih unpacking. I'll finish the kitchen tomorrow and put my bed together in the afternoon. It's all very exciting!  ~D~
