Lesbians Against Bush In America. and they had all this rainbow and pride stuff. i ended up spending $60 on two books and some stuff for me and some presents for taylor. i put it on the credit card, i hope my parents don't kill me. after that, we went to the cultural thing on campus that has the first photograph and other things. then we met alex and carlo at a bar to play shuffleboard. i was lazy so i just watched, but it looked like fun. when the waitress brought over another pitcher of beer, she asked if andrew and i wanted cups,without asking for id or anything. we declined and had water, but still, it was weird. that's never happened to me before.  sunday we got brunch at einstein's bagels, then i drove home. god I-35 is so annoying, they're doing construction all the way down. at home, i was so tired, i fell asleep from 6 to 9, and i'm not a big napper.  my throat's been hurting for the past few days, and today my mom freaked out and thought that i had strep, so she sent me to the doctor. i don't have strep, but it hurts like abitch and i got some antibiotics. it might turn into mono, so i'm supposed to rest and drink fluids and all that crap. which blows. i hope i'm better before taylor gets back. on the other hand, it means that my parents don't expect me to do anything for a while and i get to spend the whole day on my computer and watching tv. wait, that's what i do anyway....  so that's what's been going on over here in my corner of the world. bye!
