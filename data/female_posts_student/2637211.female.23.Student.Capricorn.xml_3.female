It really bugs me how easily the people on the show forget why they're there: it's the history, stupid! Quit whining about how hard it is, I imagine it was worse in the 17th century. Remember Roanoke? They ate each other and everyone died anyway. Living in close quarters and having to work your butts off is not the worst thing in the world. In fact, it would be such an adventure to actually live as people really lived then. I can't imagine how difficult and yet amazing it would be. Of course, the producers probably are editing in the sections that are most dramatic and crazy, I bet they were normal and content for at least some of the show.   Also, what's up with the women's hair being everywhere? I mean, they're doing a better job with the clothes than the people on  urlLink Frontier House , but it's so not period to wear your hair down and in your face. And doesn't it drive them crazy? When I do reenactments for just a weekend, I'm so thankful for period snoods and caps that keep my nasty, greasy hair out of my face and out of my way. Even touching my hair is too much when it hasn't been washed in a while. But those are just my nitpickings. Has anyone else been watching and have any opinions?
