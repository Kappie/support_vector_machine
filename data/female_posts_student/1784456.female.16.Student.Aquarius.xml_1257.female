Daydreams of far away places, That make you stir and wake.  The sand in your hair, The wind in your face. This is where I really live, In my protective case.  Completely left alone, To do what I wish. Who knows what I could achieve, Living in this state of bliss.  Kes  WOW! It kind of works! Has any one else noticed that black to white has to go through grey? Ahh, clever thought provoking point aye? (Err... no)
