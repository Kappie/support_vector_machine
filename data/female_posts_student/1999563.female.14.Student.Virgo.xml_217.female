Tuesday: Went to a church thing then my grandmas super fun (and tasty...) christmas party. These two guys kept stalking me around. At first I thought they were hot but then I changed my mind.  Then we went to LOTR. GOOOD movie!   Wednesday:Babysitted this crazy 3 year old then guitar lesson.  Thursday:NOTHING! :) Friday: Went caroling w/ CYT.   Yup thats the end.   Just a side note...  If you want to know where I was for  2 wekk, I got in trouble thats all.  I just want to say thanks to people like Shannon who just said "Oh, you got in trouble. Thats no fun!"  Then didn't ask any questions..but it bothered me when people would be all like "Oh my gosh, Laura, your such a horrible person, what did you do?!"  It doesn't matter what I do, its what I do about what I did. Does that make sense? Well, I am changed...I wont ever do that again.
