But there's just one little thing that's just really really really annoying me about you, you see, Yeah yeah, like I said, you are really fit, But my gosh! Don't you just know it?  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?  So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard, I was waiting in the queue looking at the board, Wondering whether to have a burger or chips, Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford, When I noticed out of the corner of my eye, Looking toward my direction your eyes locked on my course, I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order, Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?  Whoah Leave it out Are you smoking something? Leave it out Mike, just leave it We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment It's not worth it, Mike Leave it out, Just leave it Don't touch me Don't touch me, I'm alright  For a while there, I was thinking, yeah but what if..? Picturing myself pulling with bare white hearted wit, Staring at you standing there opposite, Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick, And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queueing was clocking onto you to it, I had to admit that yeah, yeah, you are fit and I do want it, But I stopped sharking a minute to get chips and drinks.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?   Oi, just as you started to make your big advance, With the milkshake and that little dohnut in hand, I was like, nah, I can't even, no you look grand, But you looked sharp there, smiling hard suggesting, and, Leaning away with your hearty hearty looking tan, But I admit the next bit was spanners to my plan, You walked toward my path but just brushed right past, And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?   What do I give a fuck, I've got a girlfriend anyway, Oi, we're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play, I've got this stella I bombed from that last cafe, This night's not even begun, Yes, yes, oh yay.   I did fancy you a bit though, yeah I must say, I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display, But this is just another case of female stopping play,  In an otherswise total result of a holiday.  I'm not trying to pull you, Even though I would like to, I think you are really fit, You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?    God BLESS Mike Skinner!
