It's something I've just started, so it's nowhere near complete yet. I think I jsut did 4 or 5 people today, and played with the layout and junk. It's hard work you know. And if you don't see your name, or your face yet, or any words underneath your name/face, it's because I haven't gotten to you yet. I've still got a bunch more to do, as well as find everybody's picture.   Have fun reading the "Testimonials" as they are rightly called. I'll be babysitting today and tomorw, so if you're important, I'll call you. If you aren't, well..have fun :) Email me. Out!
