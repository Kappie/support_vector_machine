We've got a couple of options. 1) Completely ignore this and write it off as Becca trying to blow some steam. 2) Write her back and do exactly what she asked, which is insult the crap out of her.  And my personal favorite, 3) Go to somebody's house NOT at school, all of us (except maybe Abby, cause she really doesn't know anybody), and sit down and talk this thing out like adults, because that's what we are, and if we can't work little miniscule problems like this out, we'll never get any of life's other problems figured out.  We need to set up some ground rules and enforce them, and this needs to be done SOON, as in this weekend.  There are bigger problems in the world than out little group, so let's just settle this now, and get it over with.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one getting sick of this.  I know for a fact that things need to be said.  Let's get everything out in the open, because I'm pretty sure the heart of the matter hasn't been brought up yet.  And that's all I have to say about that.  What do yall think?
