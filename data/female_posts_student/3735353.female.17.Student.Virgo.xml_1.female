I was going to hang out with Mel today so I got up around 11 to take a shower and be ready by noon so me and Mel could hook up and go shopping.  Well, I since I didn't answer Christian's call last night, I figured I'd call him, see where he was, if he'd even answer.  WELLLLL...if you can believe it, he did answer.  He said he was on his way home from Jorge's (which I was very impressed by--staying the night because he was too drunk to drive home. Most of the time he'll just drive anyways which scares me to death...) and that he was just about to call me. He said he was going to go home and see what his mom needed him to do, and then if she wasnt there or whatever he would come and hang out with me and Mel.  Well, he ended up coming over and Mel called about 1230 and said that we (Me, Christian, her and Mark (her BF)) should all go to lunch. So we went to Chilli's.  Yes AGAIN. I just went there last night and then like not even 12 hours later, I went again. UGH!   It was kinda fun I guess. But Mark doesn't really talk that much, and so me and Mel try to keep conversation flowing. But I do have to give Christian some credit, he talks A LOT more than Mark.  Then we went to the mall, and then me and Christian took Mel and Mark home.  Me and Christian went back to my house and just hung out here for a few hours. We went to Barnes and Nobel cause I wanted to get some books, and then we went to his house and just hung out until mid night when I had to be home.  Which is where I am now.  Tomorrow morning Christian has an interview with FBISD for some afterschool program, and then he's gonna go have breakfast with me before I have to leave for vacation.  I'm not really looking forward to it as much as I was before because tonight my mom acted like a big bitch. Like for the gayest reasons she was getting all pissed at me. She made these chocolate chip cookies for the vacation, and just told me I could have some but that I couldn't have very many. Like one or two.  Well, I'll admit, I had more than one or two. And then today I was upstairs with Christian and I had a bad craving for one. So I went down to the pantry and opened up the container they were in and I remember thinking (seriously--I swear to God I thought this) that someone had been eating them, cause like they were almost all gone.  So I just figured it was my mom and she'd just given up on trying to save them.  So I had like 2 and then went back upstairs. Well then my mom came home and started getting ready for the vacation and she went to pack the cookies and she started SCREAMING at me about how I don't respect her and blah blah.  It was so lame. They were fucking cookies!!  And then if that wasn't enough. She calls me while I'm over at CM's (we left cause I had to get away from her!!) and she starts yelling at me again about the damn cookies. She's like "I'm so pissed that I'm not going to give you any more money from now on. You can't fuck with me Whitney. That's it. I'm not gonna let you treat me like shit anymore."  PSYCHO BITCH!!!  So yeah that was just stupid and lame and it just pissed me off at her even more. Like I really hope its that time of the month for her so that way she atleast has some kind of excuse for getting that upset over some damn cookies.  SO needless to say I dont wanna have to be cooped up with her all weekend. I plan on just taking my new book and keeping to myself. She can go and be gay by herself...if thats even possible..=)  Well it looks like I better be getting to bed now. Tomorrow I have to be ready for the adventure that is breakfact with CM. But I wont be able to update until after I get back from the vacation. But I will when I get home.  Until then....  *whitney*
