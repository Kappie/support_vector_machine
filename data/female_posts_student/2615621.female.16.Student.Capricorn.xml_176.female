Howcome i'm like always happy and other people arent? i wondered that a few minutes ago. now, sometimes i really get upset and think im done with and im tired of going on, but gimme 15mins and i'll be a-ok. Maybe my chemicals are just screwed up and im getting an overdose of those endorphines or whatever that make u happy. i hear its suppose to give u a high feeling..hmm..that would explain a lot. and u know how when ur nervous or ur about to go on a rollercoaster and u feel ur body release ..whats that stuff...adrelein or however u spell it, and u suddenly have a rush of energy? well, i can be sitting down completely calm and make my body do that, i once asked someone if they could do it and they looked at me like i was fuckin insane and said "no julia, i cant make my body release chemicals that it does on its own.." lol well i can. haha i felt gifted. maybe thats my problem, i naturally drug my body up..hmm..now ive made myself look like a total idiot cuz i bet everyone can do that..haha oh well.   IM FREAKIN TIRED OF THIS "FREE RED LOBSTER DINNER" POPUP!! IM ABOUT TO SCREAM! it wont go away, no matter how many times i click close or end program..it just wont go the fuck away!! GRRRRRR ok..it's gone now..wow, wonder what i did right.   I've written 2 songs in the last 2 days. one is called "the real world has left me once more" and is about how we long for such a happy world where everyone is happy and all that bullshit and the only place (and saddly enough) we can find it is in our own fantasy world. heres a line "sometimes i wonder why the city lights come on outside and wake me from my dreams" the point im makin in that line is not only do we live in a world how we want it in our dreams, but the city lights also smbolize the real hettic world...ok..i prob look like a crack head now hahaha next song. it's called "prefers to fly" i also labled it "joe's song" its about wanting to committ suicide. i wrote it so it wouldnt look like i wanted to kill myself. "walking through a storm as the rain pours down on ur soul. i talk to angels, but you prefer to fly" and the chours is "you dance with angels, holding their hand as you fly away. you think of them as friends, but they don't want to know you until the end." The first song i wrote, i ended up not liking it, but i like the "prefers to fly". i might post the whole "prefers to fly" song..idk yet..i never let people see my songs..so feel honored. anyways, im not sure if im done with both of them.   *much love and photographs*
