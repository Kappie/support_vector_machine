But yea Wednesday was cool we went out to dinner and were the like loudest there. We felt kinda bad for the hostess cause the 9 of us walked in and she told us to wait for 5 min for a table and so we just like all sat down in front of her and we were like the only people waiting so when the table was ready she goes "Joanne, party of 9." like there was a crowd of people in the restaurant waiting for a table and we, being arrogant New Yorkers, couldn't contain our selves and just laughed at her like, "Dude, we're right here." Dinner wasn't too bad, not grandmas pasta but it was okay. Thursday at the race was cool. I met Bill Cosby when I was waiting to do the 4x1. It was kinda cool cause it waslike, Bill Cosby lol. He shook my hand and like a stong wind came and knocked something down and he asked me if I did that and I said "Sorry. I just can't control myself sometimes." and he laughed and then like, it fell over again and some other girl asked him if he did that and he looked at me and said "Sorry. I just can't control myself sometimes." it was cool. That night we went to Bennagins and had "Kill Bill Night" in the 4x1 room. I love that movie.  Friday was okay, we watched the boys and then did our own thing. We went back to the hotel and did the most rigorus workout ever, which included like an hour in the hotel fitness center. Then we went to Ruby Tuesdays in this mall. At one point, this boy looked into the window by our tahle and when he noticed we could see him he like smiled and waved and walked away. Then him and his team walked in. They sent us over a note that started out "To the fine ladies at the window table..." They asked if they could walk around with us after dinner and we sent back a note sayin yes. After we ate we romped around K-Bee Toys and almost got thrown out cause we were hula-hooping in the store and playin basketball in the kiddie hoops. Then we met up with those kids. They were from Maryland and not all too interesting. Saturday we got to the meet at saw those kids and they were such pricks they didn't even say hello to us. We watched a bit of the meet, I bought some things for Mario. Then we left after puroosing through all the bootleg stands. I've never seen so many Jamacians in my life. We passed this one stand with all these like purfume oils and stuff and I saw this one called "Rear" and I asked the guy why anyone would wanna smell like ass. Then he gave us this one called "Lick Me All Over" which wasn't too bad. Then we smelt one called "Pussy"... yes... "Pussy" and God it was terrible. So I go "God, I hope it doesn't smell that bad."  The University City was really nice. I liked it. It was like a little village. There was one restaurant called "Penne"...get it.. Penn-e.... So over all the trip went well. I got really sick when I got home though, I wasn't allowed to go to the meet today and I'm not allowed to go to school tomrrow. Can't wait to see all the work I'm gonna have. Yi[[ie Skippy. x0x
