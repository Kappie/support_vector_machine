She only muttered stuff to herself all the way back to Kiamo Ko. There she landed back into her bedroom trying hard not to knock anything around with her broom. Evil. That's all she could think about. Evil Glinda! She marched her way down to the kitchen for a snack. Chistery was sleeping on the counter. Elphaba moved her way over and shook him. "Get up! Get up you lazy ass." Elphaba roared.   Chistery, startled, flew up and hit the ceiling. He glided down and stood my Elphaba.They moved there way from the ice box to the oven looking for food. Elphaba found some bread and broke a piece off for Chistery and herself. They headed back upstairs. Half way up the spiral steps they met Fiyero. Elphaba stopped. Fiyero stared her down. He looked into her dark hazel eyes. He thought back when he was at the window watching the Witch on her broomstick. He moved closer and finally came in with a kiss. His fabricated lips tore and he withdrew in pain."Yero my hero. Let me fix you up." Elphaba said.  She went ahead and pulled him up the stairs being ever so careful not to tear his hands. They moved with grace. As if floating on a cloud. Opening the door to her room Elphie went to the cabnet and took out liquids, herbs, dust, and of course the Grimmery.  Glinda adding the final touch of rouge to her cheekbones stood up and posed. She looked herself down. Today she was in a Quox blue attire. A skirt with flowers stiched at the bottom for a lace. She pulled at her vest with shoulder bells brushing up against her curly hair.Finally, she slanted her hat at the brim and puffed up the feather that hanged in the back. She put on a smile and grabbed her papers. She headed out into a long hall covered in green drapery and pictures of great Ozians from the past. Glinda stopped at a bust of the Wizard. She puckered up her lips. Wonderful Wizard my ass. She flipped her hair and made her way to a great balcony. As she came out of the shadows a loud cheer shook the city. Glinda could only smile and wave. She blew kisses to the younger boys that we're standing on the bases of the city street lights. They could only blush. After calming the crowd Glinda cleared her throat. She closed her eyes and began. "Fellow Ozians. It is a great honor of mine to tell you all that....that the Wicked Witch of the West at last is dead. Dorothy, the girl who fell from the sky, liquified her. And the Wizard himself has claimed of her death as positive. We shall honor Dorothy in The Great Hall of Ozians. But, please we should not celebrate this day, but mourn for the Witch did not know what she was doing. She did not choose her wickedness. Ozians, spread this good news throughout the land. I bid you a wonderful day and may the Unnamed God bless you all. Thank you."  The crowed cheered. Glinda bowed and went back down the hallway. Several munchkins greeted her and talked of a celebration for the Witch's death. Glinda only smiled. She nodded her head and hurried back into her room. She undid her vest and pulled off her skirt leaving her only in her white underwear. She pulled open two dark wooden doors and searched through a pile of hanging shirts, vest, skirts, hats. What should I wear to Elphie's she thought. Glinda, of course, being the proper girl she is always wanted to fit right along with the theme of the party. She found a bark colored skirt and slipped it on. She finally found a matching suit and a belt with a white flowed as a buckle. She slipped quickly into the outfit and pulled back her hair. She added a smoking eye shadow with just hint of glitter. She was ready to talk to her long time friend. She sat up in excitment and head out into the hallway. She made her way down a marble staircase. Then out a dark green door. She entered a room a pink book right in the middle resting on a stand. She opened it at came to a page. "Transportation," she read outloud,"Quox leaves and Owel leather make my weight as light as a feather."   Glinda floated up into the air and a bubble formed around her. She drifted off into an opening in the ceiling. She was off to see the Witch.
