So I showed up for this supposed orientation and apparently I"m way too early. I 've been to both the OSP and MAPMES offices to find someone who can vouch for my health insurance and BOTH officed are closed on Sundays. Great. So apparently the MAPMES meeting is either and 10 or 10.30 in that building where the ulpan is being held. Perhaps today's luck will change and something will actaully go right. It's super hot, but the interiors are air conditioned (kind of.. ) and there seems to be aloto f comfortable seating about. I met my other roommate this morning when we both met in the washroom. I suspected someone else was around last night when the main lights which I had left on were switched off and the bathroom lights were switched on. Anyways she told me I had so much brave and then offered the frigde to me so that was really nice. Now.. wish me luck... I'm off to the bathrooms, I wonder if there is toilet paper      P.S. there seems to be a proliferation of slushis in this uni cafes.. SCORE! (no bubble tea sherbet as yet)
