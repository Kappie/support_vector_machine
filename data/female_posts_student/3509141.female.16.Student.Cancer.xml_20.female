Be warned though, if u disagree with something I've said and comment about it, expect a rebuttal from me. I'm like that.  Anyways, I've realized that my posts aren't very conventional. Usually, blogs take the form of a diary or journal, telling of the day's events and the person's reflections about them. In the case of my blog, however, I try to be as vague as possible on what happens to me. Instead, I focus on thoughts that derived from these events and build on them to create questions, hypotheses, theories, and philosophies. This is prolly because recapping the events of the day won't help me nearly as much as the analysing of my thoughts. That's just something I've realized...  Anyways, just felt like noting this, but Poetry.com wants me to write a poem and biography for their Internation Who's Who in Poetry. Now, I never sighed up for this... I'm even sure if I'm obligated to do it. It just might be written in the fine print somewhere when I entered my previous poetry entries... What a bother...  Also, I passed up a chance to go to my church friend's house. This kinda surpriced me as it sorta contradicts the topic I was gonna talk about today. U c, seeing my church friends on the weekends r usually the highlight of my week since school is always such crap. I've always taken comfort in these friends. Their very prescence has helped me though my period of depression during first semester. I've molded this in this statement: I find strength from without, instead of from within. I don't even no if strength is accurate. I might be more like  stability . Just being in the same room as them, listening to their conversations(I'm the quiet one), makes me super mellow. I forget all my worries. It's similar to playing video games and watching anime, both of which mellows me out temporarily, but much more effective. Without these friends of mine, I doubt video games and anime would be enough to keep me from attempting something irraversible... ie, suicide or a mad machine gun sweep of my school.  But me deciding not to go today... Why? I'm not regreting that decision, but why did I make it? Is it because I'm mellow enough from seeing them yesterday? Or too mellow from seeing them yesterday? Or perhaps I feel too tired or even too inadequate to face them? I think I'm growing distant from them. I practically talk to them on MSN everyday about gaming or anime matters, but the serious talks... they don't come to me for those anymore. It's cause I've been burying myself in computer games recently. They come to me, and I tell them to go away. If it was me, I'd be discouraged from talking to someone if they told me to go away everytime I tried to start a conversation.  One of them said something about this the other day. He said, although I was the oldest(when one of them isn't present), I'm perhaps the most immature and cared more about computer games than them. I no I'm immature. I am that way. It's sad, but I can't bring myself to do anything about it. It saddens me to no how dependent I am on others. I can't even ride the bus by myself...  I do care about them though, as much as they care about me. Even though the love is always there in our little group of friends, the relationships I have with each of them is quite different. Let's call them M, L, and H. M is a smug cute little boy(only in the eyes of adults) who is three months younger than. L is a big gangsta-like guy who looks exactly like the kind of person who lives as troubled a life he does who is six months younger than me. H is a super-liberal girl who seems like Lori from Gilmore Girls, except with an invisible shroud of mystery around her emotions who is five moths older than me. Let's see, I talk to M daily, usually about anime and video games. Now however, I'm begining to take him for granted and sometimes unintentially talk crually to him. L is being emgrossed in his personal troubles, and I'm not privy to it because I'm too busy playing computer games. H, the rest of us almost never c anymore; we're begining to doubt we no who she is anymore... The point is, I'm growing distant from all of my church friends, the ones who I can't live without.  Will the day come when they become strangers? I can imagine that day and I no I'll be crying. I don't want that day to come. So, if ur reading this, M, L, and/or H, I need u, even if I say I don't, I really NEED u. Please, stay by me no matter what, and I'll try to do the same. God nos I'll hate myself if I don't...
