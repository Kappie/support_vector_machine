Um if u do decide to visit Quizilla please see what kind of shit you are. I didnt post mine it semed kind of embarrasing. Oh Well life's good hope everyones ok 2. catcha later dude.      You are an Elementalist. Your magic stems from the forces of nature. You might be a forest nuturing Druid, a storm-creating Weather-Wizard or any of the many Elementals, but one thing is sure-- your bond with nature is strong. You can rely heavily on nature to support yourself aesthetically or physically for it lends you both comfort and strength. Your instincts rarely fail you. You are vibrantly passionate but are sometimes carried away by your own emotions.    urlLink   Which Magical Order Are You In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
