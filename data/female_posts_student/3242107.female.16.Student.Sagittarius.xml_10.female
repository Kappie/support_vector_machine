FINE! u stay home but dont complain to me about being bored and not being able to do this and that.. ugh he acts like i dont have a car.anyways. ugh and me and clint have talked about this next part before. my dad totally treats me like the red-headed step child. if my younger brothers do something they shouldnt, they dont get in trouble and he acts like he doesnt even care. but if i do something that doesnt even come close to the severity of what they did, he goes and acts all mental. and then he yells at me, and makes me get mad and start yelling back and all this crap.  and he acts the same way between me and stephanie. ugh! i swear the only time hes ever decent  is when i have a game. or he wants to talk about softball. and then ugh 1 day i went to go watch the guys play the woodlands and i came home and was excited because it went into extra innnings and darrel got a walkoff homerun and i was trying to tell my dad aboutit and he was like- sara, i dont care. go tell your mom. OMG! CAN U SAY WHAT A BITCH!??!??! i can. and it goes on and on. sometimes i wish my parents would split so i could just be with my mom and only choose to see him when i wanted. but idk. lifes a bitch.
