She's always finding some excuse to stay awake and bother me. Be it water, teddy bears, stories, piss, monsters, or inexplicable needs to scream her fuckin head off, she WILL stay awake until SHE is tired.     So tonight I put her to bed fairly easier than usual and she only got out of bed once to ask me for something to put on a mosquito bite that she had scratched and irritated: "can you get me somethin' to put on my bobo so it stops itchin''?" "um I don't know where your mom and dad keep that kind of medicine but you can have a band-aid" "I know where it is!"     So she bounces into her parents' room and I follow her. When I get to the bathroom I find her standing on the toilet holding a tube of PREPARATION H. "is this the right stuff to make it stop itchin'?" so of course I'm like: "yup"     so I dab the hemorrhoid medicine onto a tiny band-aid and stick it on her forehead where the scab is and she's on her merry way.   mammaw like to have died when I told her.
