Looking out the window, Into the sky. Waving at death's wagons, That fly easily by. Cursing the men, That sit in the seats. Wondering if, I will be kissing their feet. With death they come, With god they will leave. They are more powerful, The can do as they please. God can't you hear me? Screaming for help. With my burned out throat, And my burned out core. God can't you hear me? I can't take this any more! I'm staring at you. Safe in the sky. Oh how much I want to, Take off and fly. The bombing won't stop, The dying won't stop. What did we do to deserve this? Deaf of the screaming, Blind of the sights. Senseless to guide, Into the night. Why try to live, When I will die. Fearless I step, Into the sky. Dead already, Wasn't that lucky? I didn't suffer, I wanted to die.
