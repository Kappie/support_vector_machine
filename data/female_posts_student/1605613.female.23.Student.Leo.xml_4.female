Palmer,34, hit a sparkling .140 with 0 HR and 6 RBI last year in an injury filled season. In fact the last two years have both been injury filled, seein Dean play only 30 games. Dean's best seasons came in 1998-2000, when Dean was a legit 30 homerun threat. This is supposed to be an attempt to revamp the Tigers infield, I think it's just them trying to lose a 129 this year.
