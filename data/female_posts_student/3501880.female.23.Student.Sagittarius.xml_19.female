I just haven't spoken to him in awhile, and realized today how much I missed him (yet apparently not enough to actually call him).  While making hot dogs for lunch today, I realized that my remaining hot dog buns had become stale. What makes a hot dog so good is because the dog is blanketed in some pillow-y bread. I panicked for a moment, because I didn't want to eat just plain hot dogs and almost threw the weiners in the trash (which would have been upsetting, because they were Hebrew National hot dogs, and it probably would be sacriligious to throw away things that have been blessed by rabbis, and as a result, would have angered God).  Then, I remembered a little known family recipe that my brother created called "The Taco Dog". The Taco Dog is pretty much what it sounds like: a hot dog wrapped in a tortilla shell. When my brother first suggested the idea for the Taco Dog, I had been skeptical. In fact, I've never been a great proponent for mixing different types of cuisines (Supposively that makes me a "food purist" or perhaps a "foodist"). But, lo, I kicked down my mental prejudices about keeping food "separate but equal" and began to integrate. Much to my surprise, the Taco Dog turned out to be GOOD and extrememly versatile. I experimented with different types of toppings put on the Taco Dog, and discovered that my favorite was the Asian-Inspired Taco Dog (a taco dog with hoisen sauce).  Thus, this afternoon, amidst my hot dog bun crisis, I pulled out the old Taco Dog, and even improved it by using two hot dogs in one tortilla, because it has been well-established that any sandwich is better with double the meat (the obvious exception being the Double Filet-O-Fish).  My brother has gone on to develop other sandwich sensations, but none have been met with the same popularity and critical acclaim as the Taco Dog. The Chicken Salad Cordon Bleu (a chicken salad sandwich, topped with a slice of ham and swiss cheese) was received with mixed reviews. And despite the catchy name of "the China Muffin Crunchwich" (a toasted English muffin with crunchy Chow Mein Noodles), the public never fully embraced it, and felt the sandwich "a tad dry."  Despite his recent failure, Micah shall be remembered to his successes in developing the Taco Dog, and the joy it has brought many.
