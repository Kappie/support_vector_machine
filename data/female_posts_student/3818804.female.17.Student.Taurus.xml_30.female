Oh yea, and the two stories of the day are these: One- A young gentleman, one of my customers, got stopped for trying to steal? I actually don't know but all I know is that he got stopped. And it was kind of cool to see the undercover detectives at work and kind of scary. I got frazzled. Two- some 30 year old man hit on me...EW.  My feet hurt and so does my back. I also hate inconsiderate customers.... I'M HUNGRY  P.S. My head is spinnin' but my heart is in the right way, sometimes it has to have itself little earthquake.....
