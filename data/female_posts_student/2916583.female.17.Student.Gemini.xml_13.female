I'm slowly regaining privilleges (I watched Friends and the Simpsons and Eight Simple Rules last night, even though I'm grounded from TV). Guess what!  I might get my mom's car!  Now don't say I drive old ladies' cars...I thought I would have to bum rides all through high school, so any car is good.  I would love to drive a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible, but hey, that's not gonna happen anytime soon. Tip of the day: If you're an evil dictator with sights on ruling the world, read 1984.  That's what I'm writing for my research paper.  It could be as cool as that book that details how to be an evil world dictator.   Well I have a headache.  After the next paragraph, I'll peace out.  Later. I found this good site.  I'm going to edit every entry to post one in every entry. Here's today's:    You're a Caramel!!  You are known for your sweetness. You are comfortable with yourself, and help others feel the same way about themselves.  You are generally friendly to everyone, and believe in second chances.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
