Are you happy out there in this great wide world? Do you think about your sons? Do you miss your little girl? When you lay your head down how do you sleep at night? Do you even wonder if we’re all right. We’re alright. We’re alright. It’s been a long hard road without you by my side. Why weren’t you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my mother’s heart, you broke your children for life. It’s not ok but we’re alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now I’m writing just to let you know that I’m still alive. The days I spent so cold, so hungry, were full of hate, I was so angry, the scars run deep inside this tattooed body. There’s things I’ll take to my grave, but I’m ok, I’m ok. It’s been a long hard road without you by my side. Why weren’t you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my mother’s heart, you broke your children for life. It’s not ok but we’re alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now I’m writing just to let you know that I’m still alive. And sometimes I forgive, yeah and this time I’ll admit that I miss you, said I miss you.  It’s been a long hard road without you by my side.
