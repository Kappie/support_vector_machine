I really felt guilty taking money though, because I'm used to volunteering my time with the elderly, but I didn't argue when he threw like twenty seven dollars my way for "adult sitting."     Eliza and I played tennis from 8 until about 9:30, when it got so dark we couldn't even see the ball anymore! Hahaha, these guys came so I initiated a grunting contest, and we successfully reeled them in. What can I say, watching Wimbledon not only put a lot of plays into my mind that I can't pull off, and Serena taught me how to grunt. Time well spent.
