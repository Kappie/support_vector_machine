Now, without knowing anyone, even the language or any background information of the city and/or the country as a whole, I'm on my own. The ticket I purchased is restricted so I could not change my flight itinerary. I felt completely betrayed, abandoned and lost and had absolutely no desire to go... I even thought about giving up the tix previously but no, I changed my mind; this might be an opportunity to break the patterns of my passivity and dependency. Let's explore the country I have not previously had any interests in. It should be fun to explore new culture and meet new people!    Here is the tentative plan for my trip to Spain.   7/14/04 [Wed]	4pm (JFK)- 	                New York 7/15/04 [Thu]	9:35am (BCN)-                 10:30am(BCN)-  12:05pm(VGO)	Vigo 7/16/04 [Fri]	Train to	                Santiago de Compostela 7/17/04 [Sat]	7:30am (SCQ)- 8:35am (MAD)	Madrid 7/18/04 [Sun]	Maybe train to either Segovia or Toledo	                         7/19/04 [Mon]	4:40pm (MAD) -5:45pm (BCN)	Madrid/Barcelona 7/20/04 [Tue]		                        Barcelona 7/21/04 [Wed]	7:00pm (BCN)- 8:10pm(MAD)-                 9:35pm(MAD)-10:45pm(VGO) 	                                                                                                    Barcelona/Vigo 7/22/04 [Thu]	7:30am (VGO)-9am (BCN)-                 9:55am (BCN)-3:00pm (JFK)	Vigo/ NY    It'll be a rather tough journey but I'm going to keep myself busy and sightsee the cities as much as I can. I even got myself fairly decent hotel rooms which means, by the time I come back to New York, I'll be completely broke. At least though, it might as well be a relaxing vacation... Whew, I've spent a few thousand dollars in a few days.
