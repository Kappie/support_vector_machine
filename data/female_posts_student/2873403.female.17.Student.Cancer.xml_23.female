Its like "What? You got a paper cut? Oh damn, it looks like you're going to have to quit lacrosse..." Its not going to happen, but it makes me laugh a little anyway. Its only the second day and I'm already getting a bad vibe from this deal. But if its even half as good as last year, it will be worth it I guess, plus now I can just cause myself intense pain every day! Woohoo. Oh well.   So last night, Nick and Rob and Kelly came over and we sort of but not really watched "Freaky Friday." Then we watched "The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars" which was crrrrazy awesome. And of course Sir Nicholas was used as my pillow (my very boney pillow) and I fell asleep several times. My hair was a great source of entertainment as well... yeeeeeah... And it was like the first time ever that Rob was somewhat quiet... all thanks to the loss of his voice. It was insane. And I think I was also sort of sick. But still, it was good times.
