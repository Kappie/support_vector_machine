It draws me in, somehow, and often times I wonder about this delicate art form and the subtleties in it. The beautiful grace of the arms. The wrists. The hands. Those slender fingers.   Her fingers. Her beautiful fingers. I could watch her, gracefully applying lotion onto those beautiful hands, for years and years and years. Meticulously rubbing her hands together with the graceful slinkyness of a sleek egyptian cat. Those beautiful, beautiful, satin-like hands. Perfection could be found in those hands. Happiness. Her hands, and only her hands.
