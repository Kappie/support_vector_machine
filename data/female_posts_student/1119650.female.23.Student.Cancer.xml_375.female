I don't know where it will errupt from first: my family, my freinds or my friends from home.  My mom is constantly venting how much she is angry with my aunt (who lives across the street from us) and its getting to a boiling point becuase all of the responisiblity for 3 households is being dumped on my mother.  Granted, my brother and I help out, but we don't really know how much more we can do.  I take that back, I help out, my brother runs around and smokes pot with the other neighborhood hoodlums, and he owes me $135.  (Pay up you smarmy bitch!)  Last night I had a dream that my best friend from home, Ashley and I, had a huge falling out and it was very public and very bitter and it was a dirty, mean and otherwise nasty war of words.  I'm scared to think this might be coming.  I don't forsee any reason why it would, but generally when I dream about something thats not totally insane and wacky it will generally happen within a month.  I'm also starting to rethink my whole "Hey, Ash, let's get an apartment together" kick I was on.  I can only be responsible for me and I have to lead by example, not by doing everything for people.  Finally this morning I saw that a lot of drama had apparently occured over night.  I think people are starting to think that my friends and I are bitches.  Yes, we are bitches to a certain extent.  Yes, we are "those girls" who are gossipy and mock everyone, but we do it more as a joke than anything else.  People really need to learn to lighten up.  Everyone gets down on us for beign bitchy, but I know personally that my outward "I'm better than you" act is just that, an act, 'cause on the inside I'm quite insecure, but being able to act this way gives me some sort of sense of self esteem in my life.    Maybe I'm just PMSy and moody.  Who knows.
