I'm kinda frustrated and disappointed with alot of things, and with alot of people.  First off, I feel like what I really really want is being snatched away from me. And I can't let that happen because I don't have the luck that everyone else does. And the one chance I get is being spoiled for me. I need to take control, but it's so hard because of circumstances.  And then, my mom starts talking about confirmation again. Because it's close to that time of year. And I don't think she understood why bringing it up got me so worked up, and i don't think she could figure out why i broke down. It's so stressful trying to make your parents understand you. And I don't have the strength to try.  To top it off, I'm facing a huge GUILT trip that isn't even my problem, yet I  still  feel absolutely horrid.  And 50 million other things that suck.  Suck suck suck suck suck.  Take some control, crazies.
