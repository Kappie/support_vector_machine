I don't really know, it's not here in front of me. Last period of second semester I have guv'ment.   Yes, Linds, I know I'm supposed to be in bed, but I got a trileptal buzz and I can't do it. Har har, this shit is great. And while I'm in such a weird mood, I wanted to let you all know that I got a 5 on the English AP exam, so eat it :) j/k. I'll never do that good again. But yes. Very strange, that. It's a very strange night, I'm going to regret being so boastful in the morning. Not trying to, but...you know. Sometimes these things just happen. I thought I'd die on that one. Eh. Actually, I thought I'd die on U.S. history, but I got a 4 so it's all good. I'm going to shut up now and find some place to fall over, peace all.
