It'll be fun.  Tomorrow is the Friends season and series finale.  It seems as though everything is coming to an end or just beginning.  It's a nice but upsetting feeling.  My friendship with Bella is growing.  We were so giggly this morning.  It was fun.  Just so much has happened.  There's not much time before we all leave for summer vaca.  Happy Hump Day and Happy Cinco de Mayo.  ttyl
