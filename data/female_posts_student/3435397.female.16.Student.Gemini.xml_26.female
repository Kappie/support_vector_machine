As you all know (probably) Erin left today for Camp Monahan and will certainly not be back to post for a long time.  Her last wish (before she left that is) was for me, Rhiannon, to post one last little message.  Here goes nothing!   Taylor Rhodes : thanks for  everything!  =)  Jackie Myers : You're my smile when I'm down.  Ashley Wirtz : You have always been there.  Megan Jack!:  (your new nickname) My farie! or how do you spell it? That's WRONG!! (we looked in the book!)  Jessica Dieter : Say cheese!!  Michelle Antonio : Don't dye your hair without me and towels!  Christine Goetz : Who is going to be my beautiful while I'm gone? or yours?  Regan and Rory Filyk, Nick Faye, and Braden Karchewski : I love you guys like a fat kid loves cake (only chocolate)  Chris Brown : Because of your piece of string I will never lose my ankle!  Conrad Ford : I am so going to buy a Ford truck when I am 25 and name it Conno and it will be my Conno!  Devin Pacholik : I never knew how big of a sap you really are! I love you!  Spencer Miliokas : please keep Jackie in one piece so I can see her when I come home.  I will really really really really miss  Mike Switka !  He means the world to me, and I am so happy I met him!  Mike I love you and can't wait to talk to you!  Thanks guys for always being there.  Without you, I wouldn't be able to live!  You mean the world to me!  That's all folks!  This is Rhiannon signing off, and on behalf of the beautiful Erin Wetherill, Later Gator!
