And then there's this diving tower and so I was like, "I'm going off the 5 meter!" which like is pretty high, not for some ppl but for me... and yeah so I did and then finally convinced Dylan to and then Jess and then Mark who was kinda being a party pooper cause he wouldn't like do anything. Meh whatever it was so much fun. And then like, taking all the floaty things and making like a huge raft and just floating on it.  Then Dylan got us into (us being jess and me) running off the platforms into the water so you like doubled your air time and like were like flying and it was so much more fun than just jumping off the platform. That was just on the 3 meter but then near the end I decided to go off the 5 meter like that... only cause Dylan kept telling me to (he had done it tons of times before) and yeah it was fricken aweseome.  Oh and using the flutter boards but standing on them and trying to balance, all of it was fun, everything. And jumping into the cold cold pool (for lane swimming) after you've just been in the hot tub.   Then theres Mark who didn't bring any money at all so I had to pay for him to get into the swimming pool. And then jess, when she went off the diving board she didn't pull he top down enough and Dylan was like... uh jess? your your... and then yeah lol... but he was like all saw,turned around kinda thing. And brennan's been pissing Jess off lately (and he likes her and they went out and yeah it's complicated) but yeah Jess was like it would piss Brennan off so much if he knew that and so yeah just to piss him off she's gonna tell him about the whole Dylan thing.   It was all so much fun I mean like, prolly the best day I've had in awhile, just hanging out with friends and just having a complete and utterly good time together. And Dylan really is so incredibly nice, I don't get why Chad and Brennan both don't like him but that's their problem and if Chad tries to tell me shit about him and tries to make it so I'm not friends with Dylan then I'm going to tell him, he can't pick my friends and if he doesn't like some of them well then he doesn't have to see them but he can't stop me from being friends with them.  So we've decided that once Jess and Dylan get back from their vacations we're going to go to like all the leisure centers and prolly back to the Talisman center cause it's so much fun!  So then I got home and like hit the bed and I was out till 8:30 this morning cause my dad phoned to tell me to take the dog for a walk and now I'm here typing all this up.   So today, we were gonna go to the zoo (dylan and jess and me) but now my dad decided that I can't because we're going to a bbq at my dad's friends house for Canada Day, which shouldn't be bac or anything and people I know are going to be there it's just I would have liked to have gone to the zoo because I would have been able to see Dylan and Jess again before they leave... well I might still see Dylan cause he leaves in a week tomorrow but Jess is leaving on monday.
