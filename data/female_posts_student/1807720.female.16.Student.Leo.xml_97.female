She actually made time to help me today and I definetly appriciated that.  There is still lots I don't understand though and I am worried about the test because only *I* truly know what I understand and don't understand.  The lab in chem was actually kind of fun.  I sort of understood it a little bit better than usual but her directions are really confusing cause I hate when she like scribbles little arrows on the board to different thing and like it gets kind of confusing.  But yeah it was fun, and well I did more than usual this lab.  I actually like did stuff instead of just sitting and watching.  It is actually more interesting when you actually like do that lab.  I sort of understand it a little bit better but there is so stuff I sill don't get.  I hope I did good on that chem test on Wednesday.  I will be upset if I did bad.  I have soooo many things to do this weekend.  Tommorow is Friday and usually I am excited but there are soooooooo many things I have to do.  At least I feel better today and my stomach feels alot better.  I didn't have any meat or milk though cause those things don't agree with my stomach.  I didn't eat too much today either.  I lost 4 pounds since yesterday.  That is kind of scary when I think about it, I don't really think that is too healthy loosing weight quite that fast.  Oh and my horoscope today was actually really what I think describes "me" I thought it was really interesting:    There is really no such thing to you right now as 'try.' When you set out to do something, you do it, no questions asked. The weight of the responsibilities you have on your shoulders might cause other people to stagger, but you have enough strength to carry on for as long as you're asked to do so. Your day isn't filled entirely with work-type activities, though. When you do get the chance to play, you play just as hard as you worked. The way you see it, anything worth doing is worth well.
