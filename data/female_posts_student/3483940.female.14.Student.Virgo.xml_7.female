I feel like crawling in my bed and going to sleep. how lovely. but you see its 5:37 and if i were to fall asleep now, i would wake and not be able to sleep the rest of the night. I have this headache, i believe it came from stress. I have so much studying to do. but i dont feel like doing it today. so i will study tomorrow. I hate headaches, but im begining to ignore them, i get them all the time. I have also slowed down on taking advil or anything of that sort. because if i do, it doesnt do much...hmm... I am confused about something. Something that I shouldn't be confused about. See yesturday i was have a conversation with a friend. it was a good one, even though it was basically me sharing how i feel, (because he has nothing to share with me..haha). anyways he as well has a "blog" And wrote something like this hmm it was something about the conversation he had with a couple of people, and if it would things change between him and these people. What does that mean? WHAT DOES IT MEAN???? the insanity. (i probably did not spell that right)Does mean like change to be better friends, or change to be less of friends, or awkwardness... im not sure, i would just like to know. Haha i make myself laugh. Laugh i tell you LAUGH. ok now. I just want to know what that means. im such a freak. but thats alright with me. The rest of my family is upstairs watching t.v. as a family. its kinda creeping me out, because that never happens, but im going to go join them. its a once in a life time opportunity. and i will pretend thats all good. and it will be good.
