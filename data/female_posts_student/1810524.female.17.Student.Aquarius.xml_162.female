We recommend holding off on the self-imposed seclusion. This week you have four planets stacked up in your true love sector, so you're destined to catch the eye of someone who's ready and willing to indulge in some of your more, let's just say, peculiar fantasies. The 26th will be your best date night yet, with Cupid planning a sneak attack that will leave you sore in a good kind of way. Cupid's arrows could easily be coming from behind, so don't panic if, when you're out and about, the new object of your affection doesn't materialize in front of you. Vx
