Doc said I'm too stressed up already. Hahahahax.. for once ppl say I'm stressed up.[I mean over studies]Lol. Too playful already manx. Nevermind, I'll try to be more hardworking and determine all the way til O's from now on. [*gEeExX* I wonder if I mean that at all] Okx.. At least I get to complain about some things here again.
