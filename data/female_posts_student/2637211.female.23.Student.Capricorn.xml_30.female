I've seen him on Oprah, listened to him on NPR's Fresh Air, and I've seen ads for his interviews all over the place, notably, Larry King Live. Last week, it was all about the '80s and how Reagan "won" the cold war, and now this week, it's all about the good old '90s and our friend Bill. Remember how everyone had jobs and we had an economic surplus? Oh, and my favorite part of the '90s: complete ignorance about the rest of the world. America was a nice place where the concerns of places like Bosnia, Uganda and Kosovo were very far away and didn't concern my everyday life. I've been feeling nostalgic for then, although I must say Clinton has an unfair advantage over Reagan considering I was born the same year Reagan was elected, so I don't really have a clear recollection of his presidency like I do of Clinton's. I remember 1992-2000 quite clearly on the other hand. That would be my entire adolescence, and try as I might to forget it, my memories are still intact. Oh yes, I was in high school during the Clinton administration.
