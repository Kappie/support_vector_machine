First of all, she still hates Shah with all her might. He tries to stay away from her, and she follows him and starts hissing at him. Poor Shah. Then, she won't let him have anything that belongs to him. She has her own bowls for water and food, and she wouldn't let Shah get to his food, which was beside hers. So, I moved all of Shah's stuff to the other side of the kitchen-- I even gave her the nicer spot, by the window!!!- but noooooo, she wanted Shah's stuff, so she went back over to Shah's food, at which point I got mad because poor Shah was hungry. So, then, I fed them the EXACT SAME THING to make her happy. They are just like two furry children, for real. They ate quietly, Asia glaring at Shah from time to time and Shah returning the glares, and then they both proceeded to clean themselves at opposite ends of the living room, still glaring at one another.  Then, they started arguing again-- Asia commencing it, of course!   Besides the fact that she's stressing Shah out, I'm mad at her because she's a nosey mess.  Ale was painting today, and she went ON the palette-- STUPID cat-- full of paint-- I'm not even sure whether it was toxic!!-- and then walked EVERYWHERE with blule paint on her paws. It took me an hour to clean the trail of blue paint (she stained the ghettomachine), and when I tried to get the paint off her paws with cat wipes, she freaked out on me and tried to kill me. I chased her around for 30 solid minutes in attempt to clean her, and she hissed at me the entire time. So, then, I decided that if she wanted to keep licking her paws and die, that was her prob, and I left her alone.  Then, you can't imagine WHAT she did. She ate my homework!!!  Like, really! She went and bit a corner off my calculus homework that only took me, oh, say, an hour to do!!!?!!?!?! I was able to tape it back together, thank goodness, but still! And she scratched one of my BDB CD's.   I simply don't have patience nor time for this right now. The next few months will be hell, and she's already making it harder.  I'm really starting to think this wasn't a good idea. I'm going to let mom deal with the cat, because it was her idea, and anyway, mom's the only one who can approach her unharmed. I swear, I have only touched the cat ONE TIME. ONE TIME. In 48 hours. ONE TIME. She let me pet her ONE TIME, when mom was there. She's a little suck up with mom. She makes me so mad.   Honestly, I normally love cats, but this is the first cat to ever make me so angry and the first cat to ever hate me so much.   I'm afraid of wearing shorts around the house because she likes to attack my legs-- she hasn't scratched me yet, but she's come pretty darn close so many times.   Furthermore, I think she has fleas. Something's been biting me since she arrived. I can't even do anything about it, because I can't get closer than 3 feet to her, so I can't get the anti-flea on her.    I told mom that she should either a) take her to Petsmart and have her claws clipped off or b) buy me a leather glove (one of those that's used when training hawks), otherwise I'll never be able to get near this cat.   UGHH!!! I'm so frustrated, honestly. I so hope she gets used to it and quits being such a meanie. Back to calculus I go... and if she whines that loudly another time........................................................ *shakes fist*  }=-?   "Frustrate" by Flotsam and Jetsam  I want to kill, to throw against the wall  Hole in the glass to feel it all  A release to stay insane   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   Jump to the car, start it to the floor and while the engine's still in a roar slap it it drive  And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   I can't feel my feet but I see em flyin  Never hit the ground, rising above  Looking down on you, down on the heads of the damned  Marching all right through into the crowd   I want to scream  Clenched fist, ground teeth  A bad dream, feeling so mean  Stumble across my piece  Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel  All of the sudden it feels so real  The bang, the smoke, the blood   I want to kill, to throw against the wall  Hole in the glass to feel it all  A release to stay insane
