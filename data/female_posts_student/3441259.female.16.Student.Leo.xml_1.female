This site isn't just some ordinary journal online it is more of a story within a story. As I continue onward to create my story  "The Empty Streets,"  I will also reflect on what has happened in my life that changed how the story would go. I am thinking I would turn this into some sort of movie, anime drama, play or just a regular old book. Either way, I hope you enjoy my piece of work. You can post comments and whatnot; maybe you could get me to change a few things. Ideas are always welcomed. Further more, I look forward to the first few paragraphs I will be posting. Kick back and relax. Remember, I -am-  GOD .
