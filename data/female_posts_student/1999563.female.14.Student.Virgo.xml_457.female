As if it took minutes, it slowly floated down to our historical floor we weren't even aloud to mop. It was that sacred. When it landed, I could feel embarrassment rush to my face in the color of an apple. A red apple. "Laura!" My dad yelled, Oops.  That my friends is how to get an A in english. I have no clue why I just wrote that..it just sounded cool. I love to write. Its so much fun!  I am listening to Yellow Card. If I could find you know things would  be better.  Just a few minutes ago I was taking advantage of blogger cool search thing where you click on one of your interest and it pops up with other people who have the same interest. So I put in relient k and this guy popped up named Collin. He is 15 and he lives in San Deigo.  I loves relient k, FIF, and the beatles. He is like the cooolest guy I have ever read...if that makes sense at all. You should check him out. Well, not literaly..just read  his blog. :)  http://collinbell.blogspot.com  I wonder what he looks like..i can't help but imagine. I bet he is kinda tall..blonde hair. a jock..but not to much of a jock. I bet he doesn't care what other people think of him...i bet he isn't really popular but he has a few close friends..  Whenever I see people in the car as we drive by I can't help but wonder what their lifes are like. Are they happy? Do they have a family? Do they just go home and cry? I always make up lifes for them...   Whenever I see houses as we drive past I always imagine what went on in that house. Was their much joy? A painful divorice?  A sucicide? A musician? Hope? Joy? Love? Peace? Then I find myself dreaming about them.   One house I rowed by everyday on crew I wrote their story..the wife was a journalist and husband  was also...they desperatley wanted a family, but it wasn't happening.  Everyday, the wife would stand on the lush, green, hill, and wonder. "Would I ever be a mother?"  Oh, I am rambeling...
