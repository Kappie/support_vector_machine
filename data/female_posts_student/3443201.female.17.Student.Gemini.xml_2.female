At 1:00 pm we're all set and at 1:40 we went to the SM. I should wait for my friend, Ainess but later I texted her that we should cancel our meeting since I and Joan we're pretty busy. First, we stopped at the MENDREZ shop to look for shoes. Hmmm...there's no pretty shoes there so we go down and see for a bag but again there aint nothing we loved! Our  mind twisted  and we agreed to go to Victoria Plaza. We used to have a "one-ride" so we can have our budget. I'm quite sleepy so I'm not very aware of what might happen. Joan who was watching the road begun to react differently. As if she had a  vision . Things happened so quick, our jeepney had just bumped into a taxi! I didn't feel any fear or anger but the driver have my sympathy! No one wants to be in the middle of that situation! I feel sad instead. A traffic enforcer came got his licence and of course he should pay for the damaged. He lost his passengers including us! Why this life have to be unfair? Well, at least those two drivers I mean the jeepney and taxi driver have coOL heads or else it'll get worse. Some drivers were really warfreak! Hmmm...you'll never know what life may brings!  Oh, I had at least one thing to say!  We saw that guy again who have a dread hair! And he's still wearing a black shirt! Hmmm...small world!
