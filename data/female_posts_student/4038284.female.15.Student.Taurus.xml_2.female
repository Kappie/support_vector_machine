He climbed up on the coffee table, and was sat on it! God...he's only 11 months old, just learnt to walk, we were so surprised, thing was, if he'd have fallen backwards, he would have hurt himself badly.  So, Debbie left, and Brandon immediately started up (because he missed and wanted his mum); but I finally got him to settle down, and he was just falling asleep on me, when his dad, Gavin came home, and woke him up again, so...a good day all round ^^;  Oh yeah! -dies- Okay, so I don't usually die, but...this boy who me and Jess used to be mortal enemies with is back on the street...only for a little while, but we hate him, so we won't be answering the door to him...hehe.
