''One hundred tons, 500 tons or  zero tons ? Was it so many liters of anthrax, 10 times that amount or nothing?''"  There is also the part when they comment on Iraq selling its weapons to Syria. The only problem of the Bush Administration's theory is that Iraq wasn't rich enough to buy/harvest nuclear components to sell in the first place. As for the selling of WOMD, the reason that none were found isn't because they were all sold, no it's because they weren't any to start out with. That's the reason why Saddam always said that they had all be dismantled and he didn't have anymore nor did he run any programs to make more. The UN even asserted this more than once. Even if he sold WOMD compenents to Syria, what's wrong with that? I mean he just can't have them lying around, so he sold 'em. This is just another example of the Bush Administration making excuses.
