I came upon Rachel and said hello and it took her a minute to process.  It's really sad that connections with the people who were my best friends in 8th grade have gotten to this point.  What was also funny is that out of the blue Betsy imed me today.  Maybe its the universe telling me that it is possible to reconnect those old ties.
