I have gone to leadership camp, band camp (yeah, no comments please), started marching band, danced with 20 guys I will never see again, became an auntie, gotten sunburnt, died on the trampoline and lived to tell the tale, and oh so much more. The summer is basically over and it makes me quite sad. But the ending of my summer means that band started and it is going to be a good year. I didn't really go anywhere this summer which is cool, because it would have added even more chaos to me hectic summer. I got to hang with my friends most of June, and July has been more of me hanging and keeping occupied outside the dynamic trio. Also, all region music comes out!!!! I am definitely gonna be living off the E-fer b/c i really want to make state. Afterall, I am following Michelle's reign. And she has made state the past two years. I am not the strongest player (wait.... lemme rephrase musician) so it is gonna take a bit of work to get there.... but i am up to the challenge.... yeah. Well I am gonna go somewhere....  Also, the past note had no general audience of author. I was just blabbing away. I was kinda in a weird mood and went at the keyboard. Yup.
