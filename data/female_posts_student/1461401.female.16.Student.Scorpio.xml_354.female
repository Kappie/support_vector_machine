If that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have decided to stay at grounds and gotten to see Kat and Tony. Also, Talea wouldn't have found us and sent us on a quest to find tracy! If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have ended up with a can of chocolate whipped cream at the bowling ally, and then we wouldn't have gone over to Rob's to watch puni puni poemy! I love how mistakes can make the best of evenings!  AFRO BASTARD!
