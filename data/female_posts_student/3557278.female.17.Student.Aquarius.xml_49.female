I just bought 4 boxes ;) They are sooo delicious :)  Anyway, apart from not burgers, i had this dream last night that i got my tongue pierced lol and now i want to. it was cool! :( Damn parents! The only place i trust to do it is holier than thou, where you need to be 18 and have ID or have parents permission. Bah!   I have a driving lesson at 1 today, i really dont want to go.
