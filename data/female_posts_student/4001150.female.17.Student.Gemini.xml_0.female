Reasons:   1. i easily get pissed off my my maids lately   2. i always cut my nails too short [i wish i didnt have to cut them off, but it hurts my scalp so much whenever i wash my hair]   3. i dont like eating rice recently   4. so, me and annisa went to the "pet island" to donate our money, sorry, i mean, our  school  money. and i was so shocked [i cried!] when a dog with only three legs came hopping to me. ooohhh, what happened to that poor dog?????   but the cats are so cuuuttteeee... and the dogs were so annoying coz they made so much noise!!   oh, today i went running with annisa and i ran 3 [three!] laps! wow, thats a record for me! :D   btw, [since damien never clearly told me how to post pictures here] for you who want to see pictures of me and annisa in the pet island, visit  urlLink http://jloholic.multiply.com/photos/album/4  [you will see some interesting pictures including a "funeral" of a cat named Michael.
