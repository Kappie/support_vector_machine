For a friendly and funny soul like you, nothing opens up communication lines and lowers people's defenses like a hearty chuckle, sidesplitting guffaw, or shared snicker. Whether you're trying to defuse tense situations or liven up dull ones, humor always seems to lighten the mood and get people talking.  Whether your wit is revealed through goofy jokes, dark humor, edgy sarcasm, or sophisticated satire, your true gifts are showcased when you're making wisecracks. So bring on the slapstick, the irony, and the jests â€” eventually we'll all be laughing with you.  hmmm. well thats interesting. i like to laugh. mary poppins. that song. lol. anyways! band fest concert was today. it wen pretty good, but coulda been better. mehh. at least its done. tomoro is mom's day. hehehehe i bought mommy a josh groban cd that she wanted =D and today was my mom and dads 21st anniv. shweet!! well, im having rather heated convos on the net so i shall go now. toodlez
