Man, I feel soo refreshed and renewed! Feeling better once again. I guess I needed today at the club! Got the meal plan, went grocery shopping. No more junk food starting today! Going to follow the meal plan for what? three months I think! I can do this! Yups!! Junk food is yucky!! I'm very happy tonite! Went to Esther's to do some planning for the skit for VBS! Man, it was sooo jokes! Belita and I laffed our heads off over coconuts! Haha!! Our sillyness! Poo! Everyone's sleeping or working on projects cause of summer school! Can't wait till it's over, so I can actually spend more time with friends!Viv's  happy  tonight, doesn't happen so often! =)
