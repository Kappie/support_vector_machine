And then I ended up somewhere else, but I don't know where.  This time some guy was chasing me.  He had on a white mask so I couldn't even see facial expressions (they're the ones we used in drama, Veronica).  This guy was trying to hurt me, too.  This time we caught him though but then he got away and was gonna come after me while I was sleeping.  I was really scared but no one was willing to stay with me that night and help protect me.  That's all I remember.
