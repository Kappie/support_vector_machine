It was marvelous. We can't wait to uncork drones. Ooh, I just shiver at the malevolency of that phrase.  Uncork the drones!   Mike and I spent a rare afternoon together today. While Gavin napped under the watch of his grandmother, we slipped away and drove down to Aikahi to drop off Coke syrup. We felt like valiant heros, galloping to the rescue under 5 gallon boxes of the sugary goo, welcomed anti-climactically by a dark, empty theatre. We hope there will be much rejoicing tonight when the concession opens. From there, we took a scenic drive across the mountains to Honolulu, where Mike skipped eagerly into the music store to pick up his new amp, his early birthday present to himself. We meandered about until we arrived at Costco, a holy horror this day-before-4th of July. As we valued our lives, we swung around and fled, laughing triumphantly at the fools cramming themselves into the parking lot. Our mission accomplished, we returned home to feast on low-fat hot dogs and high-fat potato chips. Gavin narfed 4 toddler "meat" sticks ('Unique stick shape is easy to hold!' boasts the label) and assaulted the cat before dragging his Grannie outside, where he is presently amusing himself by sweeping the porch. Perhaps tonight Mike and I will continue our lovely day together by enjoying Spiderman 2, despite the preview in which Tobey Maguire declares that his suit gives him a wedgie.   A very satisfying Saturday.
