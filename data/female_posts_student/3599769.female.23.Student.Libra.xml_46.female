Keep those comments coming...I'm depending on you guys.   1. Lovely boy will... a)flip out when he figures that I wont always be there b)won't care, and will never call again c)is already seeing someone else so it doesn't matter  2. Will I... a)really move on b)take anti-depressents c)continue to drink and smoke in a empty attempt to make myself feel better   3. Chances of us getting back together... a)don't hold your breath b)only if like non-girlfriend says about him taking meds c)most likey, but then again maybe not   4. If I see him out with another girl will I ... a)throw a drink in his face b)make sure he sees that I see him and shake my head in disgust c)run out crying   5. Will I get to talk to him... a)in the next 5 days b)never c)in a month or longer   Why are boys such Namby Pambies? I used to call him that when I thought he was acting cowardly, he used to practilly spit nails in my direction. Ha! You Namby Pambie. Oh, you know you can't touch a damm boys ego.
