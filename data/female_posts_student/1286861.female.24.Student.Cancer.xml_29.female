Two great and wonderful things happened within the last week and I want to tell you all about them.   First things first�I was approved for my own apartment! I go on Sunday to sign papers, get keys, and give them all my money! Even though it will leave me broke and a wee bit on the wanting side, it will all be for the best, I know it. I will be living in the Mountain Shadows apartments in Palmdale. I have never lived by myself before, we will see how that works out. I have no furniture, but we will see how that works out. I have no license or transportation yet either, we will see how that works out.  Second wonderment is a gentleman by the name of Brenden. We spent a couple days together and, I don�t know� there may be something there. I hope so, because don�t tell anyone, but I kinda like him. There was wonderful conversation and wonderful company. There are many things about him that amaze and impress me. We went book shopping, played pool, had some Crazy Otto�s�got to know each other. I bought him a book, so he owes me a favor�hehehe.  I don�t have much time, but I wanted to get the good news out. Write at you later.
