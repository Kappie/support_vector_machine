Tom still thinks that he still likes me a bit but i don't know, especially with what Tim was saying about wouldn't it be funny if i came back to Jason now, and Jason just went quiet... I can't tell anyone else about what happened as too many people know, i felt so bad when Tom was talking about cheating etc, and i had to tell him to explain myself...  Got work tomorrow, and i never knew Carlos could drive? Well he can... and Ashleigh is lovely, Marc has picked a good one there. Not much else to write about, yet again need to be paid as its Mum's birthday on Tuesday and i won't have any money...  ~Lisa~
