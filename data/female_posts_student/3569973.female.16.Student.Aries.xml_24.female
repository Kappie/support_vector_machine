Except that I have to go to work, which shawn, christine, and sara stoppedby the other night, I was soo happy to see them. I think Im gonna just clean some today and do some extra chores for some more money for sunday. Im still working on my room. I havent gotten the fabric yet because I have had the time or the money or the gas. So I'll do that some time this week so that I can atleast get started working on that. I got asked to go to the movies last night, which made me happy to know that Jessica was thinking about me atleast, but in the end made me sad because I had zero money and like always I have to be home at 9:30 on the weekdays...so usually when I have to work I try and leave as fast as a I can so that Jake can take me to get a drink somewhere real quick while we race against time to get back. lol. I think later Ill get a movie and go to Jakes...well actually I think Jake will get the movie cause I have no money. Then I gotta be at work at 6 tonight and thankfully I dont have to work anymore for the rest of the week. But at the same time thats not good, because I need the money super bad and when school starts Ill have like zero money. Friday I think me and Jake are gonna go play Putt-Putt, because either saturday or sunday we're going to my dads to clean out this room for money. But Im not for sure yet. I wish I just had the time. Well now Im mad again, because of stupid people...so instead of writing everything down I think Im gonna go yell for awhile...Till then, Later Days
