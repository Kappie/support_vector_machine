Tomarow i might go to the mall with zoe. I have to get a top for the usher concerT! i cant find one any wheres!    Also the day b4 school starts zoe might sleep over! yeah fun! we will get ready for the first day of the last year of middle school together and just hang out. it would also be totally awesome if she was in my cluster and in my homeroom! Wayyyy coools.     Man it would really suck if i got Autumn in my cluster. I mean shes nice but i can onlii take so much of he and she has SAA (smelly, afro armpits) ew.... smelly. Also i found out ian is staying back so i hope hes not in my cluster to... along with edgardo... i defently hope hes not in my cluster again.. icks. Eww it would really suck if Emily Crewson was in my cluster! she is such a snob and she thinks she is just so hott. i dont know why everybody pretends to like her. nobody does but everybody acts like they r best friends with her. its so stupid. in fact i have never met one person who has said anything nice about that freak.   I hope there are all my friends in my cluster like zoe as i already said and courtney and rachel T and C, and Kluga and Krystal! And courtney and Becky and michele... and lauren. and so many more!   Well i guess thats it for now    Samie
