I am actually really enjoying class although at times it has been a little boring so far, but that is because we were just going over the logistics of everything. I have one professor that is a 40 year old frat boy/pretty boy with long hair, which he parts on the side and is constantly pushing behind his ears. So much so that it is a distraction. He is also rather arrogant, but I think that is to be expected of most professors. I have another professor, who has been a judge on the cca for 10 years. We (the class) didn't know that at first and someone called him professor instead of judge. That will never happen again. The reading hasn't been horrible yet, but I do have 60 pgs for one class tomorrow, and the reading for the other two classes.  Some funny things our professors have told us the past few days:  The Law has been called a jealous mistress, the judge said that was incorrect, it is a nymphomaniac. It will suck the life out of you, but you will love every minute of it.  Some strange laws that still exist in Texas:  Wire cutters can not be carried in your pocket. The entire Encyclopedia Britannica is banned in Texas because it contains a formula for making beer at home. It is illegal for one to shoot a buffalo from the second story of a hotel. It is illegal to take more than three sips of beer at a time while standing.    And for Krysten: racketeering - n. The federal crime of conspiring to organize to commit crimes, particularly as a regular business ("organized crime" or "the Mafia").  I sent a package to Africa today.
