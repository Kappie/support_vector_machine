Clueless is on, and I'm gonna be weird and watch it, cause hey what would happen to me if I stopped going weird? I'm might become like... like... (it's ok katie, you can say it) like one of *them* eww *shivers* god, got to stay weird! Owchie! Ear pain! Aaahhh! Ok, I'll go get some ear drops (dermatitus again) *sigh* it's always some thing isn't it? Wow, cool thought! If I chopped off my head then that would just hurt and it would hurt so much that I wouldn't care about any thing else! (Yes, you wouldn't care because you would be DEAD) Ah, slight techinical hitch, hmm, suicide isn't on my list so guess I'll have to think of some thing else... On that happy note... buenos noches *or however you spell it* cu!
