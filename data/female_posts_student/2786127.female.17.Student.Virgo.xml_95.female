I'm in one of the worst moods that i've been in for a good month or so...I just got a big kick in the head rememberance of how much i fucking hate when Tim gets upset about nate. Nate is coming over to give me my sunglasses and talk to me, and tim is pissed off and upset. GET OVER IT. JESUS.  Have sworn off boys.   NOw i'm so not in the mood to hang out with nate, i would much rather curl up in my new hot pink chair and watch sex and the city.   I need money.
