Had a host of new "favorites" too.  Hmmm.    So my grip on reality's returning.  Almost time for Civ Pro review class, then heading home to get cozy with the subject's study guide for the rest of the afternoon.  Talked to the Academic Support girlie after class this morning.  Very much Oracle-like: she told me exactly what I needed to hear.  She also had some good tips for what to do the day before each final.  I was a bit worried that I'd sit around and...well, worry.  I always do better if I'm DOING something, so she gave me suggestions, and we love those.    Yoga will feel sooo good tonight, methinks.
