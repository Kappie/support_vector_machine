There was that whole Liam and pot thing (which has yet to be resovled -_-), Sean and his...self coming over(I'm still recovering from that, and no, surpirsingly nothing sexual happened..oO) and now this thing with my ex.   Sean has convinced me that the no-commitment lifestyle is grand. Looking at it, I have to agree. You can be with whoever you want as your mood sees fit. You aren't tied down to one person and their needs.   I was out yesterday with my ex, who I still kinda like. We were fooling around in the basement, and had fun, and well..yeah:P That was something I want to do. Be free like that. Knowing today, or tomorw, I can grab a random person, make out with them, and not make my ex mad. How great is that? I can play in the field until I find what I like. And that's what I really want to do.  I'm almost afraid he feels other, though. But I'll just explain to him that I am not in a place in my life where I want to be tied down. If I enjoyed it so much, then I would still be with someone.   In much other news, 9 (NINE!) days until Winnipeg and friends!!! I am soooooooooo not going to sleep!:P I'm so excited, I could almsot cry:) I can feel the hugs already. :D
