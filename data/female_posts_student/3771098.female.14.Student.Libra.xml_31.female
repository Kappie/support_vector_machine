I'm not sure where exactly, but they have a really weird water tower right outside of the church we're staying at that is blue and looks exactly like a butt crack! How crazy is that? Well, we ate dinner tonight at Applebee's. It was great. Joel and Kirby were hitting ont he waitress/hostess lady. It was absolutely hilarious. I think this is gonna' be a pretty cool trip. My van is awsome. We've got me, Jenn, Amez, Allie, Kirby, Joel, Steven, and Michael. Mrs. Nan and Rion are driving. I don't really know Rion that well, but he seems to be pretty cool. We're stopping at a college tomorrow night so yay! I'll be able to shower (there aren't any showers at the church we're staying at tonight). It's crazy. I went to bed at like 1:30 last night because I was still packing, and then i got up at 4:45 to finish packing and then get ready. Now it's like 1:00 in the morning (our time) and i'm STILL NOT TIRED!!!    A small group of us (rather, our van minus Michael, aka Ashley)got a talking to from Mrs. Nan about playing around and being, uh oh.. sexual. How gay is that? All we were doing was running around outside, and i think Steven had his shirt off. Big deal. Do you have any idea how many butts I see from these people? -lol-. Oh, and then Allie was showing us how she can take her underwear off without taking off her shorts, and Mrs. Nan yelled at her for that too, and then she was picking lint out of Steven's belly button, and Mrs. Nan said that was innappropriate too. I do not want her on this trip. She grew up in like Prosperity, with all brothers on a farm, got married (Only God knows how) and had 2 boys, so she's never been around regular kids, let alone teenage kids, especially girls, so she has no idea how to handle us. It's just gay that she's here.  Anyway, Idefinately have the biggest and heaviest suitcase out of everyone here. Ohwell. You couldprobably fitme in there if i curled up tight enough. Hehe. I really like our total group,but right now our vans arekinda' seperated.Hopefully that'll change though. One thing that is really cool is that there are no couples on this trip, which is awsome because it cuts out on thedramarama. We played spoons tonight with cups (wecouldn't find plastic spoons and weren't about to use metal ones). Well, I'm about to go to bed b/c i'm bored, plusIfeel really weirdwriting in this journalbecause i've never had a journal before. Plus, we have to drive like 14 hours tomorrow. FUN! Well, only 2 more days until we see the engines.! Buenos Noches.  Liz   Liz
