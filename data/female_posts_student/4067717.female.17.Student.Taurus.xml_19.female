Plus, I am very very mad because they're showing 'The River Wild' on abc family instead of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'. How dare they! So I have no excuse for not working on 'Portrait of a Lady'. Not to mention Calculus worksheets and BNW:R.  Band Camp at 8:00 AM again tomorrow. :( BUT I get to leave early! Yay! Except it's only to go to work. Boo.  I had trouble sleeping last night because I couldn't stop worrying about how much stuff I'm going to have to do for school this year. I've bitten off WAY more than I may be able to chew. This does not bode well for senior year! :'(
