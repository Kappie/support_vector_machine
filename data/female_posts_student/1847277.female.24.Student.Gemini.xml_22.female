But I was looking over some old emails I sent to people and it seems like I'm always kind of a downer.  So I feel the need to start focusing on the happier things in life.  If only I can think of some happy things...    Well, I've studied for prelims today.  Not wicked happy.  I went to Zingerman's for brunch.  That made my tummy happy.  Got a frozen pizza on sale at Meijer.  Yeah, awesome!  Nothing like cheap food to make a girl's day.     Righto.  Definitely have to work on it.
