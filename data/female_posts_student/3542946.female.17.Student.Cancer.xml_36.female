Maybe if they weren't so strongly against the idea of hooking up with a transsexual then they wouldn't be suffering the lingering after-effects of discrimination! I thought to myself, we need someone like her in this grand country of ours, uncovering the rife descrimination against transsexuals that goes on behind closed doors (and two-way glass). To my delight, my prayers have been answered! Miriam, Anti-Discrimination Goddess, is coming to Australia. Better yet, she is coming to our TV screens. Miriam in our living room!     8:30pm Friday Miriam enters the 'Big Brother' house under the guise of a sexy latin-dance teacher, codename: 'Maria'. Housemates are unaware of that little 'something' about Miriam, as they were inside the house when the Reality TV show 'There's Something About Miriam' aired in Australia. Sources say that Miriam has sensed an anti-transsexual vibe flowing from bachelor Ryan, Kane, and married-man Paul. Her particular method of investigation will certainly be effective in discovering and eliminating any transgressors. The m3r Club wishes Miriam well during her 3-day stay within the confines of the Big Brother house.
