I mean if you just stumble onto my humble little blog I would like to know. I went to this Ren Fair and really liked it, but I"m not sure what kind of gameing I'd like. Went on the gameing central forum board, but nothing was really explained.   AAAHHHHHHHHH computer taking over brain.   Cannot have a replay of todays math test in science tomorrow. MUST GO!   Really...  I have to...  Stop it...  Grumble...  Fine I'm gone...  Do I realy have to study? ...  Ya I do...   Sigh.
