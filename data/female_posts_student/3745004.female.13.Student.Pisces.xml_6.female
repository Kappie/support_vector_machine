So, I'm there for a bit, then I go back to this.. camping.. place. Sort of. There's a barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom where cars are parked and stuffs like that. And so we're all gathered by this freakin' AWESOME anime guy, looks like Crim from .hack//SIGN only wearing leather.. black leather.. mm.. :9 Anyway. And he's like, in front of this hill, and saying that there's a fire coming our way. A few seconds later, fire comes ROARING over the hill. People are all screaming and running for their cars and all, so we (we being my mother and father and I) hop into an old-style white beetle and get to the road. Then I look over and I'm all "O_O OMIGOSH WHERE'S BOY?" And my mom just turns to me all calm-like and says, "Oh, he must have died."  So I start freaking out, and my parents don't even seem to care. I hop outta the car and race back toward the barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom, which is on fire. And people are just.. standing in it not caring. -_- So I start shouting, "BOY! BOY! PETER! WHERE ARE YOU?" He just walks out (Point of interest: he's got glasses on in my dream, but normally he's got contacts) calmly and gives me 'that look' that shuts me up pretty fast. So we all get back in the white beetle and are driving down the highway when suddenly the 'rents turn off of the road onto a.. golf course.  We're just drivin' down the golf course when suddenly it becomes a cliff. And at the bottom of the cliff we see.. more golf course. Well, we can't stop ourselves now, we go flying off of the edge, then land. Boy and I crash through the windshield and start.. uh..  flying.  Like we were shot out of a cannon, you know? And the land below us becomes so teeeeeny tiny, and we hit the ground and it doesn't hurt at all. Then we get up to find mum'n dad.. then I woke up.  ...I have the oddest dreams.. >_>
