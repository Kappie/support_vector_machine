But it's such a pretty ballad...  Speaking of ballads, I was sitting in the parking lot for a while after youse goys left, and while sitting there I happened to reach in my pocket, procuring a pen and a small slip of paper...and I just started writing. Not only did what come out come out exceptionally well, but...  That's eight songs...I haven't recorded it yet, but tomorrow, it'll be done...  So incredibly scared now, you have no idea.
