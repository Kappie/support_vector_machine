The F key wouldn't work. Plus, I figured I wasn't completely ready for the Box Drill. Sigh, I really wanna pass it off, but I think we can't pass off anything on Monday. None of my friends passed the Box Drill, except Sarah-san, and she already has her uniform. Michelle-chan tried doing the Box Drill but she failed it. Hehe, loser. XD All of us were too much of cowards to even try passing it off. Keely-san tried, too, but she failed. Eh?! And she's really good at marching! If she didn't pass it, then I can't pass it. Crap, I seriously need to practice. o_o;;  Marching is becoming more difficult as time passes by. We're starting to march faster and stuff, and well, I lose control and balance. I also think I'm bouncing up and down, and I think I'm marching crooked or something. Ugh, there's no way I'm staying in marching band after ninth grade. I'll just get my P.E. and Fine Arts credits and I'm a goner! Oh I can't wait for that day... I'll finally be able to concentrate on playing the guitar, and that's gonna be so spiffy. I think I'll give my flute to Regi-chan if she still wants it, or maybe I'll just keep it as a memory, but heck I don't wanna remember any of that crap. =P  They let us out a little bit early today. At 3.30 PM I called my mom like 5 times and she wouldn't answer. Two of those times the line was busy, but I kept dialing. I figured it wasn't gonna be a problem if my mom couldn't pick me up, 'cause I could just walk since I have a key to the house. Oh, but wait... I had left the key because I thought my mom was gonna pick me up! Smart move! Since Sally-chan and Mallory-san, (Sally's sister) are so freakin' nice, they gave me a ride home. Mallory-san is the one that gives me rides whenever lunch break is over, which is really nice of her. As soon as she dropped me off near my apartments, my mom arrives. Hehe. =S I won't explain why she didn't answer the phone, 'cause I don't feel like explaining stuff right now. Heck, it's FRIDAY! That means no marching practice for two days, so I'm off to be lazy!
