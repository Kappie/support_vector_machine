The man who led us seemed really cool...I honestly think I would go to church more often if there was someone I enjoyed in charge. That's just an excuse though I guess. I have so many questions though, if I went more comfortable with our minister I think I could ask them and figure out whatI am doing and believing in. It would be better to know what it is I am believing, since I  am  believe in it. This really inticed me to come back next week, (I'll probably go to the early service, I have some "friends" who go to that one) there was this guy whowas AMAZING that played the piano and he sang. Let me tell you, Josh Groban, you've got nothing on this kid.   I haven't really done much today. I started  The Catcher In The Rye... it hasn't caught my attention at this point, (page 17)but Sarah said that I'd probably like it. I went to Felpausch and bought some healthy food. Thank God for these new snacks...they are old snacks but they come in packages and are only 100 calories. I've been doing really really well this last week eating and I'm not going to stop. I lost about 4 lbs and hopefully I can lose 5 or so more by the time my senior pictures come around in a couple of weeks. Let's see, what else...I have to go to work at 6, I'm dreading it to say the least. I have to go back tomorrow for a WHOLE day with a manager I don't know. I figure I'll bring some reading material...I'm sure he doesn't know we're not supposed to. If he says something, all I will tell him is, 'Suck it'...ha, yeah right. I would never do that. I would very much want to, but in reality that'd never happen. I've started making a little photo album on bolt. It's not working at the moment, and it's small and sucks but I think I'll to put the link on here so if anyone wants to they can see it.Oh, here's a scary thought for ya, I went to yahoo.com and typed in the title of my blog: a day in the life of a rock star. The first listing is of course, my blog. I really doubt anyone would type that in exactly but anything even close to that, it would probably give them my blog as one of the links. And that's all I have to say about that. Until next time...     urlLink  http://bolt.com/profile/photos/index.jsp?memberName=sunfire63pageNum=1       Who knows if that'll work.
