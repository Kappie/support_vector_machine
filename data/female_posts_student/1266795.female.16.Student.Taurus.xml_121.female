Why don't girls like you comehere more often?" Then when I was checking out, the bagger (another young guy) started hitting on me, but he ended the conversation with: "I'd ask you out, but I think I'm a bit too old for a 13-year-old girl."  Argh. Not that I could (or would) have dated him anyway, me being "single but pledged." :P Haha... I know that later on I'll be happy to look younger. I just have to keep that in mind.  "Shall we go to bed?"
