I remember my friend Pauline having the original version in the early 90s and, not to put too fine a point on it, it was shit. There was a video that came with the board game that was basically a disembodied head that occasionally yelled at you for......not playing fast enough, or something. I also seem to recall that before the game started you had to write down your worst fear and I always used to put "Pauline", just to piss her off (yes, I was funny even then).
