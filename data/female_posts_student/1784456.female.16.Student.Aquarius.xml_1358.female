Because they don't give a shit. Should we really respect these people, just because they are 'pretty'? And what effort do they put into looking 'pretty'? Should we respect them for that? And when they pick on people who work so hard to do well, should we laugh? If we laugh then we just fuel their idea that they are doing well. The 'pretty' people I've so far met are mostly stuck up whores, but that's only the people that I've met. Oh, when I mean 'pretty' I mean down right ugly, but some people like that sort of thing.  Have a nice day thinking.  Hate mail welcome. ;P
