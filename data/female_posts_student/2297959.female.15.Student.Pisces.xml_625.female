It's a glorious day and my lonely heart is tired again     and I am starved for her attention.     That's when Paula sparks a little light in my eye.     Sleep now sweet princess I'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb.     I'll be ready on that evening     when you're starved for my attention you'll say,     "wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky aboveand a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention."
