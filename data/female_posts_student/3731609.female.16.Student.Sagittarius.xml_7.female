On a completely different note (I obviously need new transitional phrases, I use that one way too much), I just listened to this message that I got from "Florida", a kid at camp with Andy in Ohio. I will attempt to transcribe it...it is funny as hell.  Hey Hannah, this is "Florida" a.k.a. Alex Rushin, at lacrosse camp in Ohio, and Andy, a.k.a. Michigan, who went to Ohio State, so if you have no idea who I'm talking about just ask around cause I'm sure you dont know who the hell he is, well technically he claims to have had sex before, and I called him out said, "No, Michigan, you are a virgin." Ok, thats what I said, those exact same words, and if you dont believe me you can ask him, and thats that, well anyway, he told me that he had sex with some girl named Hannah and we called you up, ok, got that? Anyway, so what I need you to do is call me back on my cell phone...you can call me Florida, you can call me Alex, whatever, I'm pretty cute by the way in case you were wondering, so there won't be a problem there, then there's a cute kid too, anyway, you can send me a picture too if you want, we're just trying to find out if Michigan has had sex before or if he is still a virgin like we believe that he is, alright, peace.  Hahahaha...I laughed for minutes about that one.
