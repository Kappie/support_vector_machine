Some of the juniors make some minor mistakes; they feel sorry and guilty about it. After the competition, some of them were cryingbecause ofthe mistakes. As usual, the seniors were busy calming down the juniors. This will be an important lesson for them. After this competition, they should know how the minor mistakes could affect the formation. Learn from the mistakes, hope the mistake will not happen again in the final competition, which will beheld on next Wednesday (21/7/2004).   Iam thankful to the teacher advisor. We got the free lunch after the competition in the canteen. Somehow, it is an encouragement to all of us.   P/s : Pray that no more rumours anymore about the band competition.
