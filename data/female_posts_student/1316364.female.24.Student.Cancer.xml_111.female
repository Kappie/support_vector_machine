The tattoo is of the Celtic Cladagh with Trinity Knot cuffs. Although I am only 1/16 th  Irish, Jesse is ½ and I have always admired Celtic design so I felt this was an appropriate thing to have done. When I get a respectable picture of it I will post it, so far I haven’t been able to get any really clear pictures of it.    Jesse got back to his camp fine and is back to his normal working schedule. He thinks he will be hearing some news regarding his RR very soon, so I have my fingers crossed. I know I will have to give him back but I would be very satisfied with 15 days with Jesse all to myself. His leave release wont be until sometime after, during, or at the end of September which means I wont have to wait as long to have him come back for good. All I know is that is will be very nice to be able to have him back.    This morning he was connected to a server that allowed the usage of webcams. I was able, only for a little while, to turn mine on long enough to show Jesse my tattoo and for him to see that I was ok. He typed that I was so beautiful, and that really made me feel so good and I am sure he was very happy to be able to see my face.    Our time apart has given us a chance to talk more about things that we have never really had the time to talk about, and although I am unhappy that he is away, I cherish every conversation we have together while he is overseas. I feel that even though we have had such a close nit relationship ever since the first day we met, somehow we have managed to become so much more closer.  I guess sometimes you can find good in rotten situations.
