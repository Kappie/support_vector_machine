Authority doesn't intimidate me, I've always identified, felt equal. We have to share a sales story with him everyday. He printed mine out and sent me a reply letting me know he'd help me in all my ventures. I also gave him a very useful sales suggestion. He ate that up!! He's also very chipper in the morning. He's not single or available though. I need to behave myself. It feels great just to be a single lady again. My best friend has spread the word already that I'm single again. I'm not interested though. I'm going to focus on my children, my school, and my work. I'll just be a mistress on the side...:D  Gotta run and baby myself. My Osha class is over so I'm going to relax and finish my book.  Love, BLG
