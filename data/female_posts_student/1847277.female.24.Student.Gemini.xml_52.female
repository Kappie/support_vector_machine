I totally blew it last night and didn't get anything productive done.  So now I have to get my lazy ass out the door into the cold cold weather and get some quality work done at the office before my Yoga class.  I'm sad because even though Matt's coming home this weekend he's already said he's not going to have any time to spend with me.  We had been talking about going out to dinner, maybe to the new Zingerman's restaurant or maybe the Earle, and now he says he probably won't even have time for that.  That makes me sad and lonely.    This week we're entering the realm of prelim topics that I know very little about, which is a little scary (Note- for me, the week begins on Friday afternoon.  Screwed up, I know.  But true.  The weekend is totally meaningless for me).  It's going to mean more work, too.  Sigh.  I'm becoming less and less certain that I can do this without losing my mind.  For real.
