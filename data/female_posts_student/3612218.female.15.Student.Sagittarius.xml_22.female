Anyway, this shall be my new blog. Wondering why I've decided to keep a blog again? Well, many things happened lately. They are impt, at least to me. This is the year when I'm taking O's. I'll like to have some beautiful memories... Beautiful or not? That's another story. Wad else should I say? I've been a total slacker lately, have been wasting my time. I regret that. Totally! I vow to start studying from this very day. Im serious. Hopefully, I get some things done.   Things to do this week: 1-Finish up my hols assignment (which apparently is alot) 2-Read the newspapers  Yup, thats bout it. Shall update later. Outta here.  p:s// feel free for comments.
