At church I only had one kid in my room which I was glad because if I had more I'd probably loose them and their parents would be very afraid. My psychologist told me I need to think of positive things I like about myself: I like: that I look older than my age, my hair, my smile, my eyes, you know something I never realized this, but I think the reason why my mind is always thinking about kind of sad things is because I kind of enjoy thinking about my life... I mean my life is like the average american family. Which says a lot for society. Hmmm.... Woah... Off topic AGAIN!!! Anyways I have some Honors reading assignments I have to do so I better go. Love,Nikki
