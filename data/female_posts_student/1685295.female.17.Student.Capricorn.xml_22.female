This person is Summer Gypsy, my friend who has agreed to help with this crap. Anyway, saw  urlLink The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . Overall it was a pretty crappy movie. The only thing that made this movie bearable were the characters. The plot was really crappy, the movie is only bearable if you believe:  World War II started in 1899 British special officers pretending to be Siberian Germans started World War II  the stereotypes about Americans and Indians are true.  There were a bunch of Indians guys with guns at one point, but they really didn't do much. It seems that the entire point of their existence, was to die at mongolian/siberian/german/british hands. Why is it that the Indians always get pimped? It was like the Afgani crpyts versus the American Army. Speaking Of Americans, the only American in the movie was the inpatient youngster who shot at everything besides the target. The thing that really pisses me off about his movie is that I ran to see it, literally. My friends and I ran against the win for about three streets and three avenues, trust me that's a long distance. Peace out till later.
