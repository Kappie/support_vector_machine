By Monday I hope to have everything all spiffy again and looking good w/ links and stuff cause I really don't like this whole thing and the comments are gay cause as Shawn pointed out you have to be a member or some crap so yeah, imma fix it no worries.  Yeah I lost my glasses today. Don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. My mom said this place inthe mall can give me contacts tonight so I might have to go there a little later after dinner cause I am really blind. Adam Felinie (sp?) said hi to me and I basicly had to be nose to nose with him before I could tell who he was. Then they laughed at me. x0x
