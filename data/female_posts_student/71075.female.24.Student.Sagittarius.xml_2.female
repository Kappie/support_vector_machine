I was floored/manipulated/moved/sustained/pick-your-poison by this movie. I came away with more knowledge about our current global situation than I'd had beforehand (shoot, I didn't even know what Halliburton was or how entrenched Saudi Arabia is in our country's infrastructure!). I tried to stifle tears intermittently--I could handle graphic scenes of wounded soldiers, but I couldn't handle Lila Lipscombe's raw emotion. I left the theater with a deep desire to do my own research and become actively politically.  For inciting such a reaction in me, I give this movie a thumbs up. It's an especially powerful film in lieu of the fact that I hail from the bowels of the ignorant masses--a political ditz, if you will. I am guilty of willful ignorance in its worst form, because I am willing to sacrifice my liberties in exchange for not having to think about how complicated it is to protect them. (Yes, I'm ashamed. But I'm not alone.)  For a long time it has been my attitutde to 1) avoid reading the newspapers except for the occasional left-leaning editorial, comics, and Dear Abby; 2) avoid watching the news; 3) avoid listening, reading, and/or watching political pundits; 4) basically avoid paying  any  attention to anything political. Why did I pull the ostrich act? Because every time I learned stuff about an issue, I'd get ridiculously angry over how things were run but I felt helpless to do anything. Anytime I took a stance on an issue, I'd discover some heretofore unmentioned counter-argument that made my initial resolution shaky. When I tried to find out what was being  done , all anybody ever seemed to do was  talk  and I didn't see that as accomplishing much.   Take stem cell research. It was my 'pet topic' back in high school. From my vague memories of research, it seemed like a possible cure--or, if nothing else, it could hold off or slow down the progression of incurable neurological diseases (Parkinsons, Alzheimers). Parkinsons sufferers who underwent brain surgery to implant stem cells (that were coaxed to create dopamine) have seen lasting results  (2) . However, a lot of people had an ethical quandary about it: they thought that making fetus tissue useful through research equated with condoning the abortions that made many stem cells available (outside of cloning or mass embryo farming, which is a whole other can of worms entirely). There was a lot of talk, armchair moralists in this case, giving their two cents on the matter. My opinion was that since abortion  is  legal, why  not  do much-needed research with it? I say, be pragmatic. But no--Bush put his foot down. He banned federal funding and said that researchers could only use what fetal tissue they already had--they could not procure more  (1) . I felt... impotent  reading this decision in Time magazine a few years ago  (3) . I didn't feel like there was anything I could do to lift his foot, so to speak. It was easier to say, "well, we're screwed."  But after seeing  F911 , I felt like I ought to research the issues brought up in the film for myself so I could have the full story and not say that I blindly gobbled up as gospel truth whatever agenda Michael Moore was handing his audiences on a silver platter. Also, his movie gave me the sense that we the people  can  make a difference if we are just willing to organize and take part.  It all  seems  insurmountable: there's so much information to filter and backstory to sift through. It's all very, very complicated and just as easy to offer pat, oversimplified and downright unfeasible solutions as it is to throw up one's hands in frustration and resignation. How can anyone ever know everything that needs to be known about any given issue and at the same time create equitable, feasible policies that will please enough people? What we need is balance, moderation, and the willingness to compromise--which just isn't possible in the current political climate. The current attitude is that if you don't take a  strong , principled stand on an issue, then you have no convictions and somehow that's  wrong . However, that in itself is wrong because it fosters division instead of unification. In order to progress as a nation, we have to discover on what points we agree and build on that. What I see a lot of nowadays is blatant, unapologetic self-righteousness. Self-righteousness implies that someone is in some way inferior to someone else. And that kind of attitude doesn't belong in politics.  It seems like an uphill battle, but political ditziness just makes the situation worse. Refusing to take part is akin to checking one's brain at the door. And if we are so willing and able to  give up our essential liberties --the liberty, the  freedom , to think and to act on our thoughts to make this world a better place, then we don't deserve the freedoms we have. And by refusing to go deeper into major issues, by embracing an oversimplistic world-view that dumbs down and omits lots of important points, we really are taking our government, our freedoms, and the sacrifices of our soldiers for granted. To accept, unquestioningly, whatever our President's administration hands us is to be severely unpatriotic and frankly un-American. In other words, if we aren't vigilant about paying attention to what's going on and  taking part , then we may very well end up handing our lives over to someone who will capitalize on our ignorance in the worst possible way  (4) .
