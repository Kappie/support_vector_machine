(this only confirms my theory that short ppl have aggressive personalities to compensate for their size. if you are short, don't be offended. i am only telling it like i see it.) I also learned that every night after we go into the backyard to feed and play with our dogs, Teddy sits and turns his back to us while we get ready to go back in the house. and when i call his name, i can see that his eyes have become red and misty. am i hallucinating or are dogs capable of crying??  i am currently re-reading The Alchemist. mark my words, this is the most beautiful, most illuminating, most relatable book of all time. it is the one that i want to have cremated with me when i die. a background: this story is about a shepherd boy who travels from his homeland in spain to the egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the pyramids. he does not know what this treasure is, but is convinced that it is part of his Personal Legend. along the way he meets all these different characters who are also on their own quest. "what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a meditation of the treasures found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our heart."  some excerpts: "What's the world's greatest lie?" the boy asked, completely surprised. "It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie." (an old man the boy meets along the way)  But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.  When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he never dreamed of when he first made the decision.  The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it's all written there.  ...people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.  It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.  The problem is that they don't realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.  To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation.       Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.      At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. when he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke--the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.
