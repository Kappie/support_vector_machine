I was driving home tonight and alls i could think about was how something isnt right and i was thinking about my life and what i didnt have. idk maybe im a baby for complaining alot about my life..who knows.. Ne ways tonight was filled with randomness. Krissy and i went to briannas party which when we arrived was already filled with the most random people from Eamon to Adrian, so i was like um ok, then brett and zach kyle showed up and mel said something about Dustin coming, so krissy and i were like ok we're leaving, besides alls i heard people talking about was how they are gonna get drunk, even Ross Sergi puked before hand so he could hold more beer. i was like ur so dumb. well we left and went and checked out matts new car which is nice, except it reminds me of a mommy car, it needs tinted windows or something, then krissy and i just drove around and when we were doing that we saw nooner and he waved us down, and we sat in a BP parking lot chatting with noone, hilstrom, and other boys, then we were like ok were leaving, and noone was like. STAY SAFE lol then we went and drove some more and some more, and now im all driven out, and then i went over to dereks alone, and he said soemthing about the sore on his dick bc of what his gf did and i was like um ok, it was like he was trying to make me jealous so i left ... and now im alone and on the ride home is when i was thinking about what is missing in my life and how i dont feel complete. I dont know if this is a father thing or something else, i just feel like my life is empty. Or this could be a greg thing... idk .. i just know something is missing in my life, and i hate it...
