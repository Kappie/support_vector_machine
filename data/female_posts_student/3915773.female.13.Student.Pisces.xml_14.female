The conclusion was that young, attractive, or pregnant women get circulated the most throughout the media. Yahoo.com news has a headline under their “In the News” section that says, “Missing Utah Woman’s Family Clings to Hope.” Lori Hackings, the missing woman, is a 27 year old and also pregnant.   What I am wondering is how they sift through all the missing persons claims and settle on just one story to publicize across the nation.
