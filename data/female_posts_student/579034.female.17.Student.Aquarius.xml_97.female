Like the ones in the movie, I can TOTALLY see Elliot being like one day. All like drunk and raving and going on about Manchester United (its a soccer team). The French, well they suck so we kicked them in the balls and the Italians are horney bastards who say "Escusi" or w/e after they attempt to molest you. Sounds like fun. Who's up for a trip to Europe? Though I have NEVER seen so many peni in my life. Like... peni and boobs were the majority of that movie. Now, boobs I can handle cause frankly I see them everyday, but peni..... I mean, like.. these weren't even young perky-peni they were like.. old... flappy... wrinkled... it was gross.   So yeah... the meet did not go over as well as I had hoped. Coach was happy though so what ever. I ran 68 for my first 400 and 69 for my second I wanted to like kill myself. Coach said that considering I haven't really been working out as much as I usually am they are good times but I still think I could have done much better. I mean, I just gotta work it harder I guess you know? Like, on my last laps I kept tellin myself to punch it and go but like, I dunno. I mean I was on my toes and stuff and I was kickin but I guess I wasn't kickin enough. Oh well. I'll just have to get to work and start concentrating on outdoors. I think I'll be running 800's this season again. That should be an adventure. I haven't run an 8 since like last outdoors. This year indoors I was mostly 2's and 4's. I'm either doing the 400 or the 100 at Penn this year that's for sure but I want the 400 and to do the 400 I better start poppin 65's or at least low 66's soon. Okay enough track rambling.  So yeah, another Saturday night and I'm home alone. Heh, sounds like the beginning to a bad Deli/ Grocery Store novel or a song or something. But hey, story of my life.  Got e-mails from Shawn and James today. Those guys are awesome.  x0x
