(",) i am actually happy that you guys are NOT telling me to wait for him or whatever...just like everybodyelse is saying!!! he just called me, and i think because he saw me having sooo muxh fun at club RoXY'S last nite. i hafta to say that the only thing worst than a heart aching are mah joints and head hurting after drinking and dancing.  i just wanna put in record, that i, aJ, is berry jealous of Ms. CHiNG for getting the best daymn schedule enibody could ask for. Yesterdy was my 13th day of working straight, and having the weekend off does not justify my having a b*tchiE manager. im happee cause you guys are happee ('o',)
