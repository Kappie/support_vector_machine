Ran into Mr. X. and was clued into a major part of his life that he's successfully kept a secret from those who are not close to him... until yesterday. I am was, and still am, completely shocked, but hey, I guess that's a part of life, and something I'm growing to deal with.   I'm going out with Jessi to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow night, and we're supposed to meet Kyle there. Hopefully it all works out, because Kyle really needs to hang out with friends now, and who better than me and Jessi? We're cute, and a lot of fun!  Talking to Max now-- God I know exactly how she feels, but I don't know what to say to her. No words can describe my sense of empathy towards what she is going through, not now, but most of the time. I feel the same thing most of the time, but I never know how to deal myself, so I am not the most qualified person. I really wish we lived relatively close to each other... we'd have so much fun! Max rocks my world.   Note to self: Download "This is War", by Smile Empty Soul. Remember to download it, Max says its sweet.
