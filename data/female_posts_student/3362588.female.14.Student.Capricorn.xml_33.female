It's a saturday, I slept in.  Job's doing great.  For those of you who don't know, I'm working at a day camp at the local elementry school.  There's like 25 kids.  It's been fun.  We go swimmin' at copper creek camp swimmin' pool almost every day.  It's been great.  And i get paid like 500, so that makes it extra sweet.  I've been practicing my dive at the pool, it's getting better.  I should have Brian teach me his dive.  He can do this loop in the air and then come down in a perfect dive.  He just hangs in the air for like 3 seconds before coming down.  It's really amazing.  I tried to do it when he dared me, and got a really bad water burn on my thighs.  Then I ran into the side of the pool and blacked out for a sec.  I was goin' really fast.  Lucky I didnt' get a black eye.  I was accient prone that day.  lol.
