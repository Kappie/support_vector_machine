The only real "test" is in history tomorrow, and that's not going to be any more difficult than what we've had before. And then there's running the mile in off-season (and that probably means I have to shave tomorrow morning...grr) but that's no sweat. Coming home, I will have the chance to meet the members of the Chinese Mommies' Book Club, which happens to include N's mother. Very, very interesting. I'm grinning already.  Oh shit, it's already 10:42 and I still haven't studied.  Orchestra concert tomorrow. I guess it's ok, but I still feel like an idiot sitting where I'm sitting because I always get the feeling that there's people who deserve to sit in my seat who end up sitting behind me. And it's at Calvary again, so they have that Annoying (with a capital A) camera that occasionally picks out the face of some unfortunate orchestra member and shows the world that blah concentration face. A said his mom thought I wasn't really paying attention, which is true, but it's one of those things that you know you do but you never want other people to find out about. I really need to practice for orch. I had some angry demon inside my head and I just couldn't concentrate; it's so embarrassing. S sits diagonally behind me in the other row and I keep on thinking that he'll listen to me and make some snide comment about things when he's with his cronies. It's a whole self-esteem thing. But I know I don't deserve to feel good about my playing yet, so I might as well swallow it. I just hope B doesn't alert to it or anything, for then I'd really get screwed.  Chinese New Year today. Parents are more generous this year, I suppose, so it's $50 in place of $40. I haven't opened Grandma's yet. I always feel so guilty opening those red envelopes, I don't know why.  Tutoring ended well today, at least: K has to study for her math final and we got through it just fine. I really hope she does well, though, because she at least has some math sense. With M, it's more difficult--but then I concede Spanish is more difficult for beginners anyways. It's one of those question and answer tests, so you read the question and she writes the answer down. She just doesn't have some sort of mental mechanism to detect noun-adj. agreement or lack of a verb or something like that. I mean, I wish I could tell success stories, but now I think I'll just have to be satisfied if ppl keep coming back :). And she owes me $67.50, too. I keep on counting how much I would earn if I charged more: $90 at $20/hr, $75 if I charged $20/hr for gas too. It's just something about money that makes me feel like I'm going somewhere. If I have enough of it, I can do whatever I want, to an extent--like go the the YSP reunion :) and go shopping, etc.  Dying of fatigue. It's been a long week, folks.
