For a while now I've put off getting to know this person who I know I would have a lot in common with. Now that person is having a crisis that I think I could help with BUT I'm not close enough to do anything now. So I'm feeling super crappy about that.  Oh, well, I'm going to add my PHPCurrent thing to the sidebar and that's about it right now.  Thanks for stopping by.  (PS: to everyone who I host, sorry that I haven't been a greatly interactive host. :-\)
