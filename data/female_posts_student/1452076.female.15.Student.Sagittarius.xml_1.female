When you're not fully awake, the seconds seem to drag on like hours. But when you're sleeping, you're told it's already morning right after you hit the pillows. School makes you miss the comfort of your bed more than usual. I'm still trying to get used to getting up at 5:30am in the morning instead of 12pm in the afternoon.  Did you know if you pick the low E string on the guitar and let the open note ring out before bending the whammy bar repeatedly, you'll get a sound like that of the motorcycle. The exact same one you hear when they're starting the engine. Cool eh? I believe there're still many other funny sounds you can produce with a whammy bar, but I have yet to discover them yet. I don't play with my whammy bar much. It makes my whole guitar go out of tune within a matter of seconds. Yucks.
