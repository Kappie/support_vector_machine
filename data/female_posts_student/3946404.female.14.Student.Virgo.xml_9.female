Mommy wants to go see  "I  ,R0B0T"   and me and daddy'll go to just about any movie. I think the movie might be scary. I'm so dumb. I get scared at the weirdest movies (Signs, The Sixth Sense, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory)..but I can go through the scariest movies without flinching.   I phreak myself out sometimes...   I finally got that Tag Board thingy at the bottom of the page, but I did something to skrew up me profile!!! It's not there anymore! I'm so dumb, maybe I should've just left it alone, but I didn't want it at the bottom of the page. Sheesh. *yawns*...It's 2:34, and I don't think I'm fully awake yet. Man,   this sux  . I dunno what it is, but it sux, whatever it is. I wonder if this'll work. I took this quiz thigy, so I'll try to put it here...
