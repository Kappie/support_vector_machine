I am out of practice so it's taking me some time to formulate the thoughts so that they make sense to the general public and not just me. I should not get discouraged, especially considering I have no idea what this book will be about. I writing by ear. Flying by the seat of pants. Noo f'in clue as to what I'm writing. So really 4 1/2 pages isn't bad at all. For now. I need to speed up the story. In which case, I need to find out what the story is. In which case I should figure that out before I try to write more. Grrrrrrrrr. I will do this.   Note to self: Also need to finish crap script. If only to finish it. Must finish it. No longer going to write people out of it. Need higher body counts.
