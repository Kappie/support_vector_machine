Well, I've been feeling very isolated b/c of the whole summer at homeness. Chilling is awesome, but I don't feel that I'm getting out enough nor am I sharing  urlLink my greatest joy  with others enough. So, by and for the  glory of God , I made a little flier presenting the gospel along with a good handful of verses from  urlLink Romans  and printed about twenty or so and folded them in a strategic way and dropped 'em in the mailboxes of some neighbors I didn't know. :D And lemme tell ya, what joy! What a rush!  I heard the calling since early this morning. So I wrote the flier and printed one out. And then I ran the idea by my brother who thought that it was  like Gospel Tracks except less hokey . So, YAY! I had a supporter. And support he did; he sat in the front yard and made sure I was safe. That was cool. What He helped use to hit me was a  urlLink Superchic[k]  song,  So Bright (Stand Up) :    you're bored, gotta wonder if there's more waiting for the dreamlife you thought you had in store trying to feel something you can chase a life thats thriller living on the edge drinking, smoking dream killers coulda been shoulda been woulda been, what might your life have been today  you're not a has been but at your life's end  will you have regrets then, have regrets then?  are you ok with today if tomorrow is the end  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could rewind and play it again   [chorus] stand up write the soundtrack for your life  it doesn't happen to you you happen to life  stand up, you know you're gonna have to fight  don't wanna lose the will to find your light  stand up, God gave you the gift of life  it doesn't happen to you, you happen to life  stand up, do something with your light  you're a light on a hill, you're meant to shine  so bright so bright so bright so bright  so bright so bright so bright so bright   we're all scared, gotta wonder what's out there  shooting down the ones who did what we wish we dared  everybody's scared to karaoke in the open  afraid we're not as special as what we might be hoping  so we're frozen, haven't chosen just going through the motions  faith and belief, courage overrule emotions  stand up and be counted for something when it's time  decide where you stand, take your hands raise em high  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could reset and play it again   [chorus]    So, I'm totally pumped!  GOD IS AWESOME  YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Umm... bare bones... woke up. Ate some weird Meusli "cereal" crap. It tasted good when combined with the awesome breakfast cereal Banana Nut Crunchness... Not plain. That was nasty. And dry. Even  with  milk. YUCK! So, um, I'll have to explain my new-found distaste of it. ^_^;;; That'll be fun. But hey, as a  urlLink wise girl  once said, "Where there are no secrets, there are no lies." Being open and honest with your family tends to be the best way to go. Notice the  tends ... ;P  Where was I? Umm... ate, watched show (Family Feud, Army VS Marines, Marines undoubtedly won... ;D), showered, relaxed, e-mail and stuff, flier create, toenails painted, saw a little of a cheesy soap opera (as part of deal to  get  the toenails painted), started printing, work out, cool down, hand-out, clean-up.   And today at 6:30 I'm going to an  A rea  B ible  S tudy, aka  ABS  because we  urlLink Lake Pointeans  like our acronyms. Yes we do. ^_~ I can say that b/c I am one and have been, like, since fourth grade  at least . But it's not the church, it's the faith, man. All about  urlLink the faith.  Yup yup.   Anyway, I'd better do the clean-up part before I go to that party, I mean, Bible study... umm... just because there is food and swimming (they have a pool! YAY!) involved doesn't make it... okay, it does. :D Unashamed! It'll be awesome though, because God's word is awesome. As is He.   GOD ROX MY SOX!
