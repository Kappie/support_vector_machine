My husband Matt and I are Republicans.  Though these days it is growing increasingly difficult to tell the difference between a Republican and a Democrat –I started to call the Democrats Liberals, in the derogatory, which I rethought because I feel that Republicans these days do not have much room to throw stones!    The difference between a Republicans and Democrats is a very distinct one.  Republicans are for smaller central government, larger local government, while Democrats are for smaller local government, larger central government.  So why, now, do we continue to see Republicans on the MSNBC talking about social programs –which lie at the heart of larger central government?  Why now are many Republicans trying to give their all to help the poor by increasing government spending for social programs, such as assistance checks, food stamps, and medical insurance?  It irks me to no end, and that is to say the very least.  I have always been a believer that social programs are the weakness of any country.  Welfare is one of the central issues to economic stagnation.  Money is taken involuntarily from those who see fit to work for a living, only to be given to those who do not.  What has America come to?  In Great Britain, along with many, many other European civilizations, socialism runs rampant.  Democratic Socialism is still socialism.  The government will care for those that are unwilling to work –within a certain lifestyle - which is paid for by heavily taxing the working class.  It has come to my attention that nearly everyone in England is the working class.  Their economy is underdeveloped for lack of the capitalistic freedom, which is so common to the great American dream.    Though these days, with the ever growth of social programs such as welfare –especially in states such as California where a family that makes more than $20.00/hour combined can suck on the governmental tit for welfare that they believe they need- America is looking more and more like it’s cousin across the Atlantic.  It is simply wrong.    Is it not true that when our ancestors came to America they came here seeking a better way of life than that they could achieve in England under the oppression of a King?  It is true that they lived in English colonies, but the underlying reason was to escape the tyranny of an oppressive government.  Wasn’t that the entire reason for the American Revolution?  Thomas Paine said, “Tis’ time to part…” in his final words of   Common Sense  a novel which led to the birth of a new country.  So why now do we resemble the socialism of England more and more?    Capitalism is the core of our free society; politics is an unfortunate side effect.  So long as politicians run our government, we will never be free.  Such was true with Bill Clinton; such is true with George W. Bush, and such will be true with the next president to follow him into the White House.  Equally and on a separate note, why is it that the government believes it is their business weather gay people should have the right to marry?  America is the land of the free, that is why thousands of immigrants move here every year, yet our own citizens, based on whom they choose to love, are proverbially stoned in the streets by the lawmakers that have sworn an oath to protect their freedoms.    George W. Bush, the presidential candidate that I voted for, has just about exceeded my patients with politicians.  While I believe that his decision to go to war with Iraq was a just one, I am having more and more trouble accepting his ideas and beliefs.  It seems to me that George W. has allowed his religious beliefs to affect his leadership as a politician and president of the United States.  It has gone too far when a president is willing to amend the constitution to further restrict a large percentage of our countries so-called ‘free’ citizens by making it illegal to marry the same sex.    Why is it the business of Washington?  Why is it the business of some overpaid politician who cares more about voting for his lobbyist than he does for his Constituency?  So in parting, I must tell you that I am considering a change in political status.  No, I’m not going to become a politician and amend every wrong low –that would take more lifetimes that I have been given by the grace of God- I am considering changing parties.  Again, no, I am NOT becoming a Democrat, they are worse than the Republican Party I have grown so disenchanted of.  No, I am considering  urlLink Libertarianism.   Perhaps someday there will be a truly free country, I only hope it is America!  ~Kristyn
