I am conducting an open-minded analysis of some of the icky things in me. I've already analyzed one point, now another: materialism. I can see myself as a program window: REFORMATTING, with the little bar that inches along. I think I'm at 20% right now. And it's not amazing progress, but it's coming along.  Hm, this post is probably most meant for S and E and K.  I was talking to S yesterday and somehow conversation wanders over to the topic of shopping. (sidebar: I hope you're happy, I'm cringing at the recollection already :)) Needless to say, it wasn't too normal. Word gets around to E, who also reminds me that it's a scary habit. And while betting how long S can stay vegetarian, I'm reluctant to put money forward. E detects it. "Saving money for shopping?" or something of that sort.  Suddenly I am propelled universes back. I see derision.  I know materialism isn't a good thing. But why am I so ready to indulge in it? And is it so terribly wrong? Even if you've earned the means to satisfy that materialism? I know S and E are different people. And I know sometimes they'll hand down advice that I don't really want to follow even if there's logic in it. I'd do what my parents told me to do to an extent, even if I wasn't all for it, but with friends it's different.  Sometimes I'll argue that I'm the independent, unyielding character. And sometimes it's probably wiser to neutralize things a bit for the sake of having company still around when you're all done. So what do I do now? I can see, yes, that it's not a positive thing to invest in outside perception and personal reaction to outside perception (read: clothing). But what if it satisfies me? what if I've earned the money? what if, after all is said and done, I still have money in the bank?  So the weather's warming up, I have the payment from the trio and Chinese New Year money and probably some left over from tutoring, and I want to go shopping.  Hm. Outside forces tell me hedonism isn't too wise right now, but other instincts are telling me otherwise.  What is my aim, anyways? I'd like to go to a good college to show that all my hard work has paid off, I'd like to go to medical school and ultimately be a doctor, doing the work that involves people and making them happy, and something systematic besides. I'm thinking of working in a big-city hospital (Boston?) as a surgeon. And on the side, I'd like to enjoy my first love: the written language.  At the same time, I'd like to be known as someone who's dedicated, who's honest, who's trustworthy, who's interesting--someone who has depth. Someone people can respect.  I'm not trying to be pedantic or high-strung like that, but straightening things out helps me think better, I suppose.  An honest analysis, please don't get me wrong. I just need to think.  I went through the only journal I really have left today. And it wasn't good material either. I can see how I was trying to make it sound a little more insightful, but I realized it didn't work. Maybe it was the subject material, hah. I was still in that phase. Blogging is beginning to look better.
