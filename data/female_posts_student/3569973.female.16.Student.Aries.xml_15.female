In everything, not just in my room. Then I came home and unloaded everything...and me and Jake went out to eat, and ended up paying in just change...lol. Then I went to his house for awhile until my parents got home and we came over to move furniture, wash the base boards, and tape. We ended up finishing earlier than we thought and went to sonic. I ended up having to sleep on the couch, because there was no where else to sleep. Which I never realized how hard it was to actually sleep in the living room. Then I woke up at like 8 this morning and watched some Harry Potter while waiting for Jake to get here so that we could paint. We painted two walls since thats all that we could do today. He went home after awhile to mow and I layed around and went up to work just cause I didnt wanna be here. My parents left and wont be back until about 12. And Im about to leave to go to work to actually work this time. Tomorrow I gotta wake up early again so that we can put the second coat on and move the furniture to wash the base boards and put the first coat on the other two walls. Then we're going to my dads. So I have a long rest of the weekend ahead of me. So well Im gonna go get ready for work. Till then, Later Days.
