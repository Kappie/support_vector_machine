For those who feel out of the flow read this  urlLink article  where he annouces his bid for the seat. The only way he would win is 'cause of his fame. I can see the campaign now: Vote for the terminator or be opperessed by mindless robots. Well... It's true, not like he would be lying about it. They are mindless robots. Anyway I just wanted to laugh and so here it is: hahahahahahahaha.
