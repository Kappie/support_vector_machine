DONT TRUST THEM. they'll only screw you over in the end and make things worse then they already are. i figured since i confided in this person so many other times before, and since shes confided in me i could trust her. but i guess i was wrong and i really feel like shes stabbed me in the back even when i asked her please not to tell a specific person what i had told her. Its amazing what some people will do. I dont know why you did it, cause she already knew but you made it 10times worse bc now she knows what has happend almost a year ago, those "incidents" belong in the past.. so KEEP THEM THERE. Theres no use in digging up old dirt when im putting a pile of FRESH NEW DIRT in my garden. I dont hate you but i most certainly WILL NOT run to you with another problem thinkin you'll keep it to ureself.   -anyways ...about my day-  woke up.. put my uniform on, went to the bathroom, absent mindedly put my toothbrush in my mouth and started to brush... i broke down, couldnt stand the sound of it anymore when all i used to do was laugh everytime i brushed my teeth.... (only you will know why)  went to my locker ..got my books went to the library, wrote sonny a letter.. cried A.M HOMEROOM:: told jess the whole story.. cried again 1-6: OFF- me and jess and z talked about sonny the whole time, i tried to study but my mind was filled with old inside jokes and memories of him i couldnt shake. 7-9: PE- spirit ball, i didnt participate. but what else is new 10-12: HISTORY- study guide 13-14: LUNCH- didnt eat.. i kinda just stared and picked at it.. then we went outside w/jess and nate and brie and cassie and me and rob listened to 'concrete angel' and 'shes my kinda rain' ...and i cried again 15-17: ENGLISH- cried 18-20: Algebra- worksheet  got in the truck w/dad, found out he knows more about my "experiences"  did homework went to the store.. even though my world is upside down.. walmart shoppers havent changed a bit, they're still evil and they show NO MERCY on the broken hearted now im here, thinkin about what i had. i miss you baby, and you'll always be the one that got away, im sorry for everything, if i ever hurt you, or made you worry about what i was doing, or even questioning your trust for me, im sorry for it all i just want you to know that i'll always love you and you'll always be my first love, no one can change what you mean to me, no distance, no words, and no amount of pain. i love you baby. December 11th- April 24th, you gave me the best 4 months and 2 weeks of my life.
