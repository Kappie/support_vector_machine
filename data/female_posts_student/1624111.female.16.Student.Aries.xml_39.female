Things...as well as people, can be perfect in their imperfection. Perfection is not so much the total absence of flaws as it is the presence of  the most desireable characteristics according to the situation. My perfect day is not the perfect day. Perfection is pretty personal anyway."  "if the world does not see fit to give you out of life all that you deserve, those closest to you will be sure to make up for all the times the world fell short."  "look at your friends and tell me there's no God...if you can, get new friends"      and, that, actually, is misquoted... assuming shes quoting me, which i think that she is. its really, "Just look at your friends and tell me there's not a God...If you can honestly do that, get new friends" but it doesnt matter, its the same message.  yeah, so thats not a big deal or anything... but, i dunno... it made me feel better cause it makes me seem less crazy... and i feel so crazy nowadays.
