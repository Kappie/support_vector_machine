OOO!, and i gots my freeeeeeeeeeee icecream scoop at baskin robbins!! thank god i had a coupon for a free scoop from buying a shrek dvd...or else i would've had to pay like $2.34 +tax..which is SO not worth it...it used to be like $2, and that was already expensive. actually i didn't buy the dvd, guess who did? (psst..he's crazy i tell yah!) mmmmmmmmmmm, maui brownie maddness...chocolate with brownies, and nuts. and then i walked over to freshly squeezed..and my brother's friend works there, so now, i can get free drinks!! hahahha..for FREEE. did you know that strawberrymango tastes like tomato? lol. and i was being a good girl today and doing my homework..actually i'm not really good, if i'm doing it on sunday right? but anyways, i'm doing my homework, and then i was like leaning on my chair back..and something BLUE caught my eye out side of my window...i was like...HEY!! isn't that...someone i know?? hmmmmmmm, i don't remember his name, but he was lookin' real kute wit his baby blue football jersey. i just wanted to run outside and TACKLE him down. hahahahhahahha. too bad i didn't, i'm sure he would've enjoyed it just as much as i would;)
