Anyway the choices are... -> physical touch -> words of affirmation -> acts of service -> meaningful gifts -> quality time  So what do u think urs is?    If I had 2 say me personally I'd probably say: words of affirmation/quality time as first, but physical touch comes close after. I mean it's totally needed as well, what would a relationship be without it?! Like some people don't kiss until their married. I mean how weird is that? I mean, if I didn't kiss in the relationship, then it wouldn't really be a proper relationship. It's just such a weird thing to think about. Not kissing....hmmmmm....weeeeiird
