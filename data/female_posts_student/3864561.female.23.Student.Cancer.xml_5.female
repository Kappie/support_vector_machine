I know a few of them arerather pretentious but I like them. And what's the point of having a blog if it isn't to inflict pointless crap like thison others?   Blue M, red MM; they all wind up the same color in the end.   Homer Simpson    This above all, to thine own self be true.  And it must follow, as the night the day;  Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Polonius (from "Hamlet")    I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my father, not screaming and terrified like his passengers.   Unknown    Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind......the race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Baz Luhrmann     Maybe,just once, someone will call me "Sir" without adding "you're making a scene".   Homer Simpson - again    In this life you can be oh so smart oroh so pleasant.For years I was smart; I recommend pleasant.   Elwood P. Dowd (from "Harvey")    And my current favourite (for obvious reasons):   Life is tough enough without having someone kick you from the inside.   Rita Rudner
