Except the sun just came out, which frustrates me.  So much has happened in the past two days that it's just overwhelming. So we'll just start with Friday.  YSP reunion. First time flying alone. I remember getting out of the car at the airport was more difficult than saying byes to Mom and Dad over the summer, and I just can't explain why. Burbank Airport has that retro brown feel, which I don't really like. I bought a copy of the New Yorker and sat down, waiting for the plane. 7:05 flight, needless to say, wasn't too full. Rode the 8:22 bus to Davis, waited at the MU for AM and S to come, and then L and K and S and S and S and C and D. Had breakfast with a few of them, R came. Tried to visit the lab with K but ended up getting a sweatshirt instead and getting picked up by a white van (R, thank God) to go to the Graduate. Lunch there, met up with M and V and everyone else, I guess. A didn't show up, and I'm sad. Apparently Greyhounding didn't work too well for him.  Everyone's still the same, which disappoints me. C and D are still close friends, R and S (who dyed her hair and got braces) are still so tight that their circle excludes all other YSPers except, maybe, the twins. M is still shy, AM and S still combine forces for an overwhelming silliness (strange for girls who are probably going to Stanford and Harvard, respectively) and that cliquey kind of feel that always makes you wonder if they're whispering something about you. Truthfully, I don't think I enjoyed that lunch very much. It was just them goofing off or K and M and S talking about Science Olympiad. The only appropriate response (since I couldn't come up with material for either SO or something outlandish to keep up with the girls) was to laugh. I can do that, but it just doesn't show that I'm on the same level as everyone else.  Well, I don't know what I was expecting, but it was still a weird feel. K and I walked the route from the MU (and Hunt, etc.) back to Tercero, which brought back so many memories for me. I just wish I had all the girls arranged in the halls again...that, I think, is the genuine YSP feel. I can just picture a Sunday morning and arranging to go to the Old Teahouse or something with I and S and L and K and M...that kind of thing, not a lunch with the soches.  And then K's mom R picked me up from the Graduate. I love her mom; she's the kind I want to have. She's been on all sorts of adventures, and apparently her mom didn't really take care of her so she decided to do a better job with K. It's funny--I could talk to her the whole entire time, from the Graduate to the B in Fairfield to Yo Sushi across from K's high school.  So we met up with K, who had her exchange student from MA and her friend S and other exchange students, I guess. Went to the mall, ate at Quizno's and Coldstone, got back to the airport. I guess words can't exactly describe that feel of that afternoon.  Saturday. MT in the morning. Baja Fresh with C at lunch, who told me I was weird...and he still won't tell me why. Practice at Harrison's sister's house, memorizing openings, setting socks on fire, coziness and loveliness. J told them about the J joke, and they still don't get it.  Haha, and here I don't feel like writing anymore because I need to memorize that opening and do Huck Finn and the chapter summary and everything in between, lol. Jack Johnson, here I come.  See, I need to be riled up to write something monumental. I'm just drinking chicken soup here, so I'm relatively calm. Never fear, I'll be back.
