You're happy because you had a good weekend, but you're sad because you have to face the world tomorrow at school. That's kinda how I feel today. Anyways, last night was awesome! Emily, Bob, Paul and I went to see Troy and then went for pizza afterwards, it was a lot of fun. Then I came home and talked to Paul for like an hour...*sigh*. I can't describe the feeling...its like the best feeling when I'm talking to him, but it hurts at the same time. A good hurt though, I suppose. So yeah, that was fun. I still have to finish my spanish project today. I think I might just blow AJ off and do it myself. I know I'll get a lot more done if he's not there anyway. Besides, I worked on it a little on Friday, so all I really have to do is find some more pictures and highlight vocab words, and verbs and stuff. Yeah. Marching Band tomorrow. I don't know...the first rehearsal excitment has kinda worn off. To be totally honest, I'd rather just stay home and talk to Paul all night...unfortunately I don't think that will happen....oh well. I think thats it for now....I really, really do not want to go to school tomorrow. Grr. Only like 2 weeks left...I'll have to hold on until then.
