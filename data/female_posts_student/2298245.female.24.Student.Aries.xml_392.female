A second official familiar with the conversations confirmed the account, and said the Arizona senator made it clear he won't change his mind.   Sorry, on second thought, it seems my use of the word "offer" is wrong:   Both officials said Kerry stopped short of offering McCain the job, sparing himself an outright rejection that would make his eventual running mate look like a second choice.  ``Senator McCain categorically states that he has not been offered the vice presidency by any one,'' said McCain's chief of staff, Mark Salter, who would not confirm the officials' account.   Of course, now that it is all over the news, and people have been speculating about it (with many dreaming that it might come true) for months, and now that we have had confirmation that Kerry was indeed open to such a proposition, I fail to see whether or not an actual "offer" was made is going to make a difference to whoever gets the job.  Not that he or she should mind being second choice, or even fifth choice, and at the very least, he or she should be consoled by being just a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  Now I don't like to toot my own horn, but I do have just three more words to add:   urlLink told you so .
