I have long thought of deleting my account here but then, I realized though how small in number they maybe, there still are even a few thoughtful chummies of mine who really take the time to visit my page, and well, I'm glad.      I have promised to never open the net again unless my UPCAT and my 1st PT were over but then, although my UPCAT had been over last Saturday yet, and my PT is fast approaching, I feel the need to open my dashboard here coz there's just practically a lot of things to share.      I'm extra glad taday although my friends know how harrassed I've been for this particular day- harrassed as in totally busy and I even missed both my snacks and lunch just to attend to several meetings. There's the PF>     It's a part of my morning ritual to come to the Blessed Sacrament every morning as I arrive school but then, with my hectic assignments catapulting nonstop lately, I can't even take the time to visit the chapel now and oh, this make me feel so guilty. Even my at-least-2-times-every-week-or-thrice rosary, I couldn't even accommodate. I feel so guilty to Jesus and to Mama Mary already. I know they understand why but then I just don't think its a reason enopugh for me to miss those very important things to do.      As you might know it, I've auditioned myself to the school's chorale, or is it? Somehow, I've l;ong been coaxed by my friends to join and so, here I am hoping I could make something great out of this endeavor. I've always wanted to, but then its the precios time that I lack, economically speaking, I experience a lot of scarcity with time lately. Nevertheless, here I am, and hoping I get to land in the job. I'm just one of the hundreds of souls ever hopeful. And the school would only take 75 so, I've conditioned myself that whatever the outcome is, I place it all in God's hands coz after all, it'll be His will still and not mine. I know whatever it is, it'll be for something greater than what I expect, with or without the singing job!      So, you're once again reading this busy girl's blog and I wouldn't want to commit to writing on this every so often as time may not permit me to do so. But then, you know where you could find me, call me or email me, or what! ;P       Friends, thanks a bunch for taking the grand time to visit my page. This has been your cute, sweet andf charming charmer (haha) j/k....neighbor here on earth, MAYCEE! LIZZIE! HONEYBEE! whatever that is..I'm OVER and OUT.
