Now before I get thousands of comments along the lines of, “how could you be so insensitive” or “What is wrong with you, your husband is overseas”, let me explain myself.  The two guys are good friends of ours and they both happen to be gay.  So no worries there, I am not so drop dead gorgeous that I could turn a gay man straight.  But also notice I said had a date.  That’s right, had...  I just got a call from my friend Paul, of my gay gentleman callers telling me that he has to cancel because he doesn’t feel good.  I told him that was fine and to go home and feel better soon.   I just feel bad that not only did I have a dinner/movie date with two guys that were gay, but they also cancelled on me.   In other news, Jesse and I finally connected again.  I was so happy to see that little messenger box pop up with a cheerful little “brrring” and lovely text that read “hello!”  He had a boring time at the other camp and felt that the trip was completely pointless, but at the same time I posed to him, that even though the meeting was boring, he did get a chance to leave his camp and get a slight break from his normal routine.  He agreed.  He also said he got the package I sent with the mystery gift; now that he has it I can share what I made.  I made him two pillows, one with our niece and two nephews on it and the other with my cat and I on it.  He said he absolutely loved them, but most likely he wouldn’t use them because he didn’t want to mess them up.  He also commented on how adorable Jacob (my oldest nephew) sounded on the audio tape I sent him, he sang the song “America the Beautiful” it was so sweet, I am going to try to see if I can get him to do it again so I can have a copy of it on my computer.  At about 2:00 in the afternoon Jesse told me he was getting sleepy and he was heading to bed.  I told him to sleep well, that I loved him and I would talk to him soon.  I also told him that I have a very busy weekend ahead and may not be home so if he can, to call me on my cell hone and we can talk for a little bit and he said ok.  He knows no matter where I am at I will always make the time to talk to him.  I have a just about a ½ hour left of work then off to home, where I will either work on the FRG Newsletter or my other side project, a web page for a friend of mine.
