I went today (wednesday) with my family for the armbands during the day (11-4), and I was on the Tilt-A-Whirl with my little brother and one of the NASTY carnies was all "Hey, Got a name!?" And I was all...ignoring him!! NASTY, EWW, ICK.   Anywho. I worked yesterday with Mackenzie Holdershaw. And when it started storming it was just Mackenzie, Megan Murphy (not related to Molly) and the pharmacist Paul. I was vaccuuming and first the power went out, and some lady was @ the pharmacy like "I heard something about a tornado!" and my mom called and was like "You're NOT going to Alpenfest tonight because it's going to storm!" and told me that we had a severe thunderstorm warning. So I stopped vaccuuming and went up to the front of the store to help Mack get things under control. Then Doug (the owner, who was on-call w/the fire dept yesterday) came running through, gave me a flashlight in case the power went out again, and was just like "watch everyone!" It was soo scary. lol. Omg, there was a BUNCH of carnies in there! I was like 'Omg, Mack, if the lights go out again...we'll be all in the dark with nasty carnies!!" It was scary. Then @ 7, there were still people in the store so we had to stay. So once everyone left from the front of the store, Mack  I closed things down and then Donna (owner's wife/pharmacist..she came back to help) let us leave.Well, it was raining extremely hard when we left and I got *soaked* on the way to the van..like 2 feet from the door. Then, when we were driving home, some of the streets were flooding onto the sidewalk!! It was really scary. When I got home (it took like 20 minutes to get from the drugstore to my house!), I found out my uncle Tim who lives in Petoskey had called my mom and was all freaking out like "are you guys okay!" because Petoskey got hit hard w/storms and he heard we were too. Yeah. We were okay though. Lol.   So, yeah. COMMENT. COMMENT. (To comment, click on the word 'Comment' by my name. ;))
