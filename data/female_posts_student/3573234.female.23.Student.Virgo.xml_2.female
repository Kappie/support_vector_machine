People with a preoccupied attachment style tend to show a great deal of openness and are eager to get close in a relationship. They can be very devoted partners.   Attachment style begins in infancy with the interactions we have with our parents or primary caregivers. Through these early relationships we begin to understand the dynamics and patterns of close relationships and we carry this perspective into our adult relationships.  Psychologists call your attachment style Preoccupied.   You tend to worry about being abandoned in your romantic relationships. You have a strong desire for closeness, but may feel that others seem unwilling to get as close as you would like. It's likely that your openness to relationships is one of the first things potential partners notice about you.   39% of those who have taken our test share this style of attachment.   Your answers on our test show that when it comes to relationships you have grown beyond your earliest attachment issues. While you may not have every issue resolved, you're making substantial progress at establishing healthy relationship patterns.    True, very true, I love my bf with every part of me but I am thinking we need to take a permanant break, I don't know though, it feels as if I will never find someone who I can connect with, I mean I could connect with him at first but I think he might be getting bored which sucks and I have no idea what to do, HELP!!
