Heather lived in a ginormous castle...somewhere...Anyway, she lived there with her mother and father and her - an unknown number to none - siblings.  They were a nice family, all good and Christian-like, in a good way it seems.  Then, one day this guy named Mike came to their castle.  Mike had some reeeeally big ears.  I'm talking huge.  And they stick out... I mean stuck out.... really far from his head.  And it was funny too, because at one time, when he had long hair, he would tuck it behind his ears.  That's not a very pretty image is it?  Well, it got funnier because then Mike SHAVED HIS HEAD!!!  That was a funny day.   Well, anyway...they got married and lived happily ever after.  And are expecting their first child or children really, really soon.  I AM NOT BALD!!  I was having a rough time...with the stress...you know, the stress, it's not good...I was stressed!!!  Damn it!!!!!  Talking bout people like he ain't got no sense.  That's why you got those big ass ears, cause you're mean!!!
