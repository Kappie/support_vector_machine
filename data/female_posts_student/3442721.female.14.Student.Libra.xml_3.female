We left the station a little late and everybody was crammed into the vehicles that were gonna take us. I was riding with the cargo, Jodi, Drew, and Jessica D. We had to turn around and go back to the station to get paperwork! So off we went again. This time everything was with us. When we got there we found out the boys were in Kit Carson a cabin, it was o so fun helping the boys find their cabin (Note the sarcasm). When everything was in place in their cabin we headed back to the front of the camp because it was like a mile hike or so.... When the girls got up there you could almost here us moan we were in the cabin nearest theirs. Dan Beard. Now remember we are the devils children us girls we listen to rock  urlLink (JULY FOR KINGS)  and punk, some country, but we are like dark and demented so we hurried and trucked our gear back to our cabin.  The Ladies we were bunking with have not arrived yet and we set up camp.  When they arrived we almost wanted to cry. They had fluffy pink pillows and a Barbie radio. It scared us!  We practically ran out of there. We gain our compotior once again and discussed it. Later that night was awesome though because I got put in team 3! With my team members and a boy that looked like Clay Aiken before his makeover. SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   We were assigned egg buddies. I dropped ours with in 40 minutes and he had severe head trauma thatâ€™s all but the said he was dead. YEAH RIGHT! We had a flag that Justin (GIRDLER as I call him) put rainbows on. Oh yes Rainbow pride for Girdler lol...  When we left back for camp we played cards in the cabin. The other girls came back and put on rap but I held my tongue. I tried to go to bed fast as not to offend them with my presence. The next morning we argued and the camp advisor reprimanded us and made us hug. We broke up into our groups and ate. Then the fun began. Compotation! We had tons of fun that day. Muddy obstacle course, skits, whose line, is it anyways? Stuff. We were having the time of our life! That night we went back to camp and we got along fine with the girls except their advisor. At the end of the weekend we had all said goodbye and we drove back to Medcorp.   The post from Bryan,  Ohio came with us to check out our rigs.
