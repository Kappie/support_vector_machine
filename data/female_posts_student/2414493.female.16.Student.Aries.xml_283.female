I'm beginning to experience pangs of guilt for not practicing  at all  for these five weeks. What a story I have for Mr. Francis. And I wonder why I quit violin, or what I look like when I play in Conejo. There were some who just sat there, legs spread, disinterestedly playing away when others were so into it I swore they closed their eyes. I'm tempted to go practice tomorrow.  You know, that's about everything I have in my head right now.  Oh, and I'm hungry, though it's senseless to go out and get food. Food costs money. I wonder how I could go through so much in five weeks.  I think I might be getting sick.
