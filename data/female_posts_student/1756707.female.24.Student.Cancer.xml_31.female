'It is almost as if one had to read from a page where all the words had been assembled in random order: obviously there could be no fixed starting point or sequence of perception.' (37-38, qtd from Arthur H. Robinson and Barbara Bartz Petchenik in  The Nature of Maps )  A map has no vocabulary, no lexicon of precise meanings.  It communicates in lines, hues, tones, coded symbols, and empty spaces, much like music.  Nor does a map have its own voice.  It is many-tongued, a chorus reciting centuries of accumulated knowledge in echoed chants.  A map provides no answers.  It only suggests where to look:  discover this, reexamine that, put one thing in relation to another, orient yourself, begin here... Sometimes a map speaks in terms of physical geography, but just as often it muses on the jagged terrain of the heart, the distant vistas of memory, or the fantastic landscapes of dreams. (38)  A single map, observed Denis Wood in  The Power of Maps , is not a self-contained document but a compilation of what ' others have seen  or found out or discovered, others often living but more often dead, the things they learned piled up in layer on top of layer so that to study even the simplest-looking image is to peer back through ages of cultural acquisition.' (95)  In geometry,  describe  means to draw or trace the outline of something; in poetry, it means to get at the essence of something, to bring it to life in a way that's both startling and beautiful.  You've got to do both kinds of description -- and do it in a medium that's partially visual, partially mathematical, partially textual, a complicated miscellany of scale, orientation, projection, grids, signs, symbols, lines, colors, words. (97)  Mapmaking has been going on since at least the Stone Age: a picture map painted on a wall of the famous Catal Huyuk settlement in south-central Turkey dates back to about 6200 B.C., nearly three thousand years before the first system of written language appeared.  And recent studies have shown that even very young children have an uncanny ability to understand maps, fueling speculation that we are born with the skill.
