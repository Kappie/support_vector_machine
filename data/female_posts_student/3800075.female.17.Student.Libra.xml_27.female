Im happy because i got to see Nathan and pretty happy cuz today was a good day all in all and michelle and i watered flowers and talked and it was really cool- perhaps the best talk ive had in ...... well a long long time.  sometimes its nice to be serious.  But anyways i feel kind of guilty right now.... or maybe sad... im not to sure.  I just read leslies blog and it made me feel 'blue'   blue yes thats the word for it.  She seems so.... alone perhaps.  I never wanted to see leslie like that, not that i havent before, but i hate it when shes sad because she deserves so much more.  And i know she doesnt want my pitty or my appology and i know that i dont help her sadness any... but i dont know what to do.  There are few situations i have gone through in my life where i didnt have the faintest clue on what to do...but this is one of them.   Im glad she has michelle to talk to.  Seems like shes the only one who can get through...but i dont know much- and i dont pretend to.  Tonight we were supposed to call les but didnt get done watering flowers till 10:30 cuz we had to fill the tank a few times and it was being a bitch, when we got here i kinda went up stairs and cleaned up for awhile and then it was pretty much 11.  most everyone was gone at like 12, except casey and nathan who stayed to play some PS2 , and it was kinda a gay night.  Casey said he did call leslie but that it was busy and then she wasnt on the net...or something, this was the translation i got anyway.  But i feel bad about that, she sat home, and like a D-bag I didnt get a hold of her.   Ya never know if ya can trust people to actually call someone when they are supposed to... cough cough  casey....  but i should have brought a cell or something- my bad there.   But anyways enough about that i cant dwell on what i did wrong today.    We did all go to the lake today.  Molly, the lil tike, came and was an absolute shit- which we didnt help matters cuz we egged her on.  I guess she wasnt that bad- but emotions ran high.  it was cool though  we swam which felt really good!  i needed that. i wanna go out there and just float one of these days.  Hmm not much else to say.  I'm thankful for the O'brien who decided to leave the PS2 for another day! Until Time Next
