I'm so not a morning person but the breakfast is yummy to the max... bacon with eggs, tomatoe and mushroom with toasted rye bread... After which we went shopping... I find it really hard to resist buying... It was cool spendin time together again..  For the next 2 wks, I'll be spending lesser time with Terence...I feel kinda bad...and I miss him every minute we are apart... Terence has been so giving and so appreciative.... He even came over in the wee hours to help my hsemate carry her luagge up the stairs... He's a sweetie... Unfortunately, he fell sick... I was so worried coz when I saw him, he look really pale... my heart was hurting... Baby, I'm sorry if I was being irrational...
