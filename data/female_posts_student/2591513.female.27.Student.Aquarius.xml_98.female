Well the one I am getting for sure is just $300, but hey, it is $300 I didn't have before.  So the school is giving the scholarship recipients a nice award ceremony and of course I want my family to be there.  I think it would mean a lot to me for them to see me get this award...maybe because it is something I did on my own...and well, I don't have a lot to brag about in my life that doesn't include my kids or my husband...so it is nice to have my own bragging rights.  Plus they are the reason I keep going along in school.  Anyway, yesterday I had an interview for another scholarship.  I don't know for how much, but it was a complete honor to just be considered for the scholarship.  I cannot tell you guys enough how good it felt.  I was actually able to tell about my dreams and my goals and why.  I have wanted to be a teacher for so long, I could almost taste it.  I fell like I am so close and so far at the same time.  I know I can be a teacher and I know it is going to be the most rewarding career Ic ould ever choose for myself.  I just need to get to that finish line.  I don't know what 4 year college to go to because I have my children to worry about and I have to do what is best for them schoolwise, so until this coming school year is over, I won't know what school best suits them.  Another thing worth bragging about is that Bailey is getting student of the month again.  I am so proud of that young man.  He is such a trooper and does a million things I don't expect him to do.  Everyday I am realizing more and more how very special this child is and can already imagine the great things he will accomplish in his life.  He has already succeeded in accomplishing more than any other person his age...but that is mommy bias talking, I suppose.  Then there is my beautiful Nalani.  The more time I spend with her, the more I realize how wonderfully challenging this little girl will be when she grows up.  She has a freedom in spirit that I wish I still had and a beautiful smile that melts away all the problems that seem to take over my life. All is right in the world when I hold her in my arms and when she runs up to me to give her special kisses to me.  Aww...and how could I forget my beautiful Emily Love.  She is a ray of sunshine.  She is getting bigger and more adorable with each passing day.  Her smile as well melts my heart.  I cannot imagine my life without my kids.  I used to want to be a teacher because I just lived kids, but I don't think I appreciated kids as much as I do now.  I now know the value of a child's presence and how each one can touch your life like no other can.  I can't wait to be surrounded by children and to be able to make a small impact in their lives.  On a sad note, my cousin Madona is moving away...just whne we started to see a lot more of each other.  I don't think that it is a bad thing.  i think it is the best for her.  She is going to be so happy with her new love and that is the best thing.  I can't imagine the incredible life that is before her and i am glad she has found someone who can love her completely and respect her equally.  I know she doesn't read this, but I wishher and Ben the best life has to offer.  I won't say anything about how messed up Leila got at Madona's going away party...I will say though that Mickey might think twice about inviting her again...haha...you gotta love Leila...just because I am not an alcoholic, doesn't mean I don't understand the "rules."  SO THERE!  Next time, listen to me when I am schooling you on alcohol.  I didn't succumb to the peer pressure...I was never one to succumb...just ask all my friends in high school and from college...I am as straight as they come.  Hey, I will drink every now and then, but why do you need alcohol to have fun?  I don't....and that's how I have always been...or maybe I am just boring, who knows...maybe both.  So anyway, that is what is going on here...Ed still doesn't know when he is shipping off...I am hoping it isnt' anytime soon.  I would love for nothing more than to have him here for Bailey's graduation.  Of course I want him here with me also.  *on a side note*  I haven't been myself lately because of worrying about Ed and well thoughts of my baby loss have plagued me lately...maybe because it is close to my previous due date...June 27th.  Aww...but the baby is in heaven with all the love of family and friends gone before.  SO yes, I do believe a baby is a person upon conception.  The baby was real and was ours.  Anyway, enough gloom, life is good and I am blessed.
