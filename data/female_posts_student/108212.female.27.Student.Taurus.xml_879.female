Hey, I finally got a real song of mine recorded!  Check out the link at  urlLink Graytail  (scroll down to Jan. 6).  Guys over at  urlLink Home Recording BBS , aka "the homewreckers" (insert pause for appreciative laughter) beat me up over the mix, so I'll be fixing it, this weekend I hope.  But I still like it for a first effort - lemme know what you all think.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- followup:  WOW!  Absolutely not Sinatra.  The very first Ma and Pa Kettle movie.    urlLink Here's the link.
