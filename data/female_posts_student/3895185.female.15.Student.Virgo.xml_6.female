Last night, however, I came home shitfaced after a nice couple of hours with Billy, Buckley, Danny and the infamous Marle. Nate stayed home with my parents and chatted. The worst part about getting shitfaced is one: I can't remember things. Two: I sometimes can't control what I do. Three: I know I'm acting like an ass. Speaking of ass, when I was laying on one of the couches and Nate was on the other I blasted ass. I didn't mean to, but it was like...hardcore ass. Yeah I know it's all unlady-like and what not but COME ON. Everyone does it... sadly. When my brother said something I blamed it on my foot rubbing against the wood on the couch. Yeah. I know I'm smooth. I don't need you to tell me. And another thing, Marle threw a goddamn beer at me. IT WAS FULL TOO! I went and picked it up and threw it back though. I'm glad Nate wasn't angry with me. I was so worried. I didn't mean to get trashed but its like I didn't notice what I was doing. He was just glad that I had a hang over like I should've.
