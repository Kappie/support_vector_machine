Sometimes days like today are just what I need. Nothing to get my hopes up for...nothing to be disappointed by...simply ordinary.  Sometimes ordinary is kind of nice.  Well, had sectionals after school...pretty gay but it didn't murder me or anything. Went to Hooters after that, and then came home. And that's where I am. Obviously.  Wow, I'm so sore from yesterday. Oooh, but it is the greatest feeling in the world. My entire body just aches. It's nice.   Less Than Jake on Friday. Hell yes.  Did I mention we get to meet them before the show? Haha, yeah, so all you other suckers going, we win. Times like a million.  Well, that's all I really have to say. See ya 'round, crazies.
