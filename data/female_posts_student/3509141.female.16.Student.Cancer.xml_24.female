And how we forget our fights fast but it stays at the back of our minds fueling our anger when we fight again.  Anyways, too much happens at school everyday for me to bother to much with what happens at home. Yup, it's almost all school. The way I feel everyday. This lack of a desire to really  live . School does terrible things to me. Maybe I do these things to myself, I don't no. Maybe I should settle for a 90% on a major assignment when my friends got 95%'s and 100%'s. Maybe I should settle for hitting the ball just once when I made countless errors. Maybe if I just settled, I wouldn't feel so bad. Ya, I blame it on school. I don't think I can last long if I blamed myself. I strive to be the best yet deep down, I don't believe I can achieve it. Maybe if I did, I would actually  try  try. But it doesn't work that way. I don't feel that much hate anymore. I simply can't. Now it's the sadness, despair, and simple shame. Y do I suk so much at everything? Y can't I be the best at  something ? Just one thing. That's all I ask for. I don't have to be a Jack of All Trades, just not a Jack of No Trades.  So... What am I? I can't maintain a 90 average. I've tried but I no it's not possible. I can't do well enough in math to beat all the competition. I don't even have the guts to enter math contests. And gym. I hate my classmates. They fuel that fire that may one day consume me. I no it and they no it. That one day, I would just explode and either turn suicidal or homicidal. And even the pride I take in writing. The truth is simply that I'm not that good. I've done peer editing and there's way better formal writers in my very school. Even my fiction is weak. I have no bond with my characters. Whatever happens to them, I  feel  nothing. None of that forlorn feeling that u feel when ur favourite character in an anime series or RPG dies. I'm no one special. In fact, with so little specialty that I'm not even good enough to be normal.  Nowadays, I only have 3 states. Self-pity, self-hatred, and oblivious bliss. The last of which can be so simply attained through video games and anime that I've gotten addicted to it. This is what one might call a routine of self-destruction. When anyone least suspect it, I'll prolly just dissappear. Maybe turn up a few days later down river or something.  Sure, I have my life ahead of me, but what's the point. I've got very little satisfaction from my life so far. Who's to say that I'll get more from the rest of my life? It's times like this that I wonder if I should just kill myself.  Then more questions arise. What  if  I kill myself? Who will care? What will my only true friends from church think? What about my friendly classmates? My less than friendly classmates? My parents? Will they hate me for being stupid and killing myself? Will they blame themselves and live with the burden for the rest of their lives? I can't answer these questions. And I doubt I can ask them. After all, there's few of them would even consider the possibility of me killing myself as long as I'm alive.  This is the way it'll stay. These thoughts will run through my mind again and again until the end. The end of my life or the end of my current state of mind. Who nos... Well, I'm done ranting... Cya
