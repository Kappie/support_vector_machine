The kid I dumped. Yah. Great times. His friends are standing on my neck trying to get my to reconsider. I have my own problems to deal with. I don't need his also. They say he's suicidal. Whoa: that is only 1/3 of the teenagers in the US. Everyone is suicidal unless they're some kind of happy freak. I am not suicidal but I think things would be much easier if I were gone. I also don't want to be responsible for this boy's death. What to do..What to do..?  "This is my stop.  Time to get off. Excuse me.  Excuse me. Not trying to be direct. (La La La) You're standing on my neck. (La La La) You're standing on my neck."-Opening to DARIA.
