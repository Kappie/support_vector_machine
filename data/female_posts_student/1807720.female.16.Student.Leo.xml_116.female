Again I sit hear crying, thinking to myself that I want to be dead.  Wishing that there were someone here right now, but there isn't right now, and I just continue to cry in the silence of my basement.  I did my really stressful Rel. project today and then I told my mom that we were going out rollerskating and stuff, and that I would be going in the evening.  So Chels friends that she works with at Wendy's picked me up and we went to Eddie's house while he had a shower after work.  Then we played pool for a while until his brother got home.  Then we went off in Eddie's car to Perkins (Which is where Chels and I used to work) and we all got milkshakes with a Cheeseburger and fries.  It was soooo good.  Then we went to Lloyds for a couple of hours.  It was soooooo fun.  And OMG this Eddie guy is like my perfect match.  I never thought he would be sooo awesome.  And well he is a University student at the U of C and is studying to become a electrical engineer.  That's kind of ironic because my sisters fiance has EXACTLY the same profession.  And Eddie looks ALOT like my sisters fiance too.  When me and him held hands it was actually really really really natural unlike alot of other people.  He is soooooo fun, but since we had to drop some people off on the way back we got home around like 12:15 PM but like that isn't that late.  Then my mom was like questioning me when I got home and no offence but:  WHO THE FUCK WANTS TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT STUFF WHEN THEY GET HOME AND ARE TIRED...hmmmmm....NO ONE!  And then she was like "Oh I was worried, blah, blah, blah, and you never called" and then we got into a huge arguement.  I told her where I was going, and was like "well you never said what time you would be home" and like she NEVER asked me what time I would be home so why the hell would I tell her if she didn't ask.  If she wanted to know so bad she should of asked.  Besides if she can't let go now, she never will be able to.  And then after our argument I told her I would talk to her in the morning and I went downstairs.  Then like half a minute later she followed me downstairs.  What the hell doesn't she understand about: I WILL TELL YOU IN THE MORNING, I WANT TO BE ALONE.  All she said is "I want to talk" and like she wanted to know about what stuff we did.  But I told her I would tell her in the morning.  I am sooo tired right now and have been talking and doing alot of stuff tonight, she doesn't understand that I DON'T WANT TO TALK RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY MEANS THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK.  She doesn't understand right now.  Besides I had such a good and fun time, and then I got home and she ruined everything.  Everything just started to turn around and I was feeling alot happier but now she has just put me is some depressed mood and I want to kill myself at the moment.  But that is nothing new.  There is so much to think about, so much to worry about, that honestly I don't need anymore fucking stress.  But obviously I am VERY stressed out right now.  Finals are coming up and those are SOOOOOO important and well I am TRYING to be happy, but that's an extremely hard task at the moment.
