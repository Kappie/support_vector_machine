Mmm... god, we're going 'national trust place to go' hunting today! Yeay! Seeing as it's bank holiday and no one's working... this should be fun! Hmm, I need to think of things to do, still gotta de-rust Reg. Oh, and then I've gotta de-mold the bathroom (woohoo!) and paint or wallpaper or some thing... I have the best life, huh? Not really, but then no one does. Is it me or is it freezing cold? Ok, ok, so anemic girl might not be the best one to ask about the temperature. (Permenantly freezing) Ok, so I'm going weird again (I thought you were permenantly weird) wear pink people! Spread the message... eat bourbons! ...Wait a sec, don't eat bourbons give them to meee!
