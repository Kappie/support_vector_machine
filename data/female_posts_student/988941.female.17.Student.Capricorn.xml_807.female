Hey ho, at least I'm enjoying school and I am making friends, I've even been invited to someone's birthday party- and she's only invited 25 people. I guess it's out of pity for the poor new girl, but hey! Who am I to complain?!! Got to get my costume sorted for that, but she's gonna tell me what the theme is on monday. Shoudl be interesting........ My other bit of news is that I'm going to audition for Cabaret with Chloe on Monday night! That should be an absolute hoot. I can't remember whether I said that yesterday or not, but tbh I am so tired I really can't remmeber! hey ho. Got all my files sorted, so I'm ready to be off Monday morning and straight into a full week! Fortunately I only have to carry a daily file as we're not allowed to take in our whole file for each subject, in case we lose it somewhere and then we'll basically fail our AS levels wihtout the notes, apparently. Anyway! That's about it for today, I shall give u an update as to whether I am going on the Gold D of E canoeing expedition in a few weeks time when I find out on Monday- Holly and I are going to bribe the leader into letting me join in!
