First of all.. i was sick yesterday (this isn't one of the good parts) but i still didn't feel well last night and i stayed up late doing homework soooooo... i slept till 8:30 this morning.  So I missed first and second periods and got there just as 3rd period reading was starting.  So i was very much awake all day.  Then, in Chem, we had a work day, and i missed a lab... and while that means i have to make it up.. that means i'm just that much less behind the rest of the class.  So then my history homework: the essay that's due on thursday, she is giving me the weekend to work on it! hooray.   Well then afterschool: Mateja has already given me a Christmas present, so now i have cute snowman socks.  And also I now have my Madrigal tickets, and Sean bought me an Ice tea afterschool (if you don't understand my excitement, everyday i look at the ice tea and wonder "is it sweetened?" so i was standing there and Sean said "well let's get it and see" and lo and behold it was yay).  Anyway, ontop of that, Kelsey's most generous parents gave me another thank you card (i get one about once a month, each with 10 dollars inside) so that was also fun.  And finally... i got my hair cut this afternoon and I love it to death.  It hasn't been this short in a really long time, but i really like it.  Well now i have to go be a model student, if you need me, you will find me slaving away over a heavy chemistry book.
