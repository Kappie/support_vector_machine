Soccer's the only game I pay attention to most of the time, and random Olympic sports.  But anyway, life is life.  Nothing's going on.  I still miss Gabe, but I should get to see him tomorrow.  Hopefully.  *shakes fist at schdules*  But in the meanwhile, I've gotta clean out this damn room.  It is MINE until it's clean!  Bwahahahaha! *falls over*  But anyway, I'd better get to work, this is a huge project. >.
