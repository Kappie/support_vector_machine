I took random stuff to help eliminate the pounding head last night and although I think I drifted in and out of reality because of it, I think it is solely responsible for me feeling somewhat better today. But not compleatly. I still feel like a horse is sitting on my chest.  I was asked a bunch of very though provoking questions yesterday by a friend who felt the need to make sure I hadn't died. God love her. After answering them and thinking about them for most of last night, I think they are something that I should share here, it truly gets the mind thinking...   what do you see as total satisification?  I honestly believe doing something I love would enable me to be compleatly satisified for once. Unlike many people, I don't see a sig. other as total satisifaction (having just come out of a very long term relationship, I might be somewhat jaded). For me, something i love woul be working in a development NGO, hopefully in Africa, but barring that in Northern Ireland. Either a) Africa: working for democracy and economic development or b) Northern Ireland: working towards conflict resolution within already negoiated peace settlements. Corney and strange, eh?  Where were you and at what moment in your life were you the happiest?  Ok, I think I have a few. But most recently, I knew I would be ok and I would live (and love again) when I broke up with my last boyfriend. Also, when I was in hot safari truck in Swaziland, slowly climbing up with hills to the capital, watching pastorial life unfold before my eyes. And probably the night I went for a walk in Dalkey, Co. Dublin. Looking at the stars and realizing that everyone I cared about was looking at the same stars as well.  What is the your principal character trait?  Independence  And which trait are you the least proud of?  The fact that I have a very hard time trusting people.  The quality that you prefer in a man?  This changes for me as I meet new people who bring new elements into my life. But right now, its honesty.  Your greatest fear?  My greatest fear is spiders and death.  What is your most valuable possession?  My sanity at all times. But material, I'd probably have to say my education (is that really material?).  In what have you succeeded the most in your life?  I'd like to think, with my height working against me, I was a pretty good high jumper. And although I"m by far not the sharpest pencil in the box, I have received my BA and I am about to do my Masters. But I think I've succeed the most at doing what I want.  Your favorite painters?  I'll let you in on a very little secret. I love art. I recently went to the South African Museum of modern art, all by myself and got wrapped up there for HOURS! Not too many people know that. But my favourite artist is S. Dail and my best friend Nadine.  Your favorite composers?  Greig  The words that you like?  Depends in the language I"m speaking, but in English, I really enjoy 'as well', 'duck', 'billiant', 'fantastic' and 'superb'. In french I enjoy (way too much) 'savior faire'.  Your favorite cult work?  Probably the white wolf fiction, preferably Masqurade (and yes, I can't spell to save my life).  Your favorite authors?  Anne Rice, Rian Milan and most definatly NOT Foucault.  The book you keep by your bedside?  Its always changing. But presently, its my journal and 'South African Apartheid: A Guide to the Everyday Racial policies in South Africa'.  The song that you often whistle?  I hate whistlers.  Your favorite color?  Green and purple. Although not together.  Your favorite drink?  Pepsi.  Your drug?  Who knows what I"ll be addicted to after one semester of grad school!  Your heroes in life?  I don't want to follow someone elses path and in my view, thats what a hero is. I admire people, but I really don't have any heros.  If you could change one thing about your physical appearance?  Don't get me started. Perfect skin would be great...right now I want longer hair..I could so go on.  The faults that you take the greatest pleasure in?  I truly enjoy not having that little voice in my head that tells me something is a bad idea. Like going to South Africa. That was clearly a BAD career move. I did not expand my academic abilities, although I did somehow pick up on economics and trade fairly quickly (making me wonder if I will someday go back to school to get a degree in economics). I postponed going to grad school by a full year, even two I think. I had emotional well being changed by two people specifically. However, I DID cement my life focus and meet some of the most amazing people in the whole world. I LOVE the absence of that little voice.  Your greatest regret?  Hum...I have always said my whole life that I don't have regrets. There are things I wish I hadn't chosen to do, but I hardly classifiy them as regrets as I usually see the benefit of doing them afterwards.  What do you hate above all?  Manipulation.  How would you like to die?  Quickly. And without warning.  Your current state of mind?  Lonely. Both in a factual point of view and in a emotional point of view.  Your motto?  Say it.
