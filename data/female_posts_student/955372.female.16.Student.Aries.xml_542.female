Because a while ago i said that i read that SARS is only fatal in older people and people with immune system problems, and he was like "no, that's wrong a lot of people die" but HE just read that only old people and immune defficient people die, and he admitted it! baha! SUCCESS! well it took fifteen years but he admitted he was wrong! score!
