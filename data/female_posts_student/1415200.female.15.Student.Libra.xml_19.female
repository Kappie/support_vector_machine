That also means school is right around the corner. And personally I dont want to technically "go" into the high school. I just want to move into the grade ahed of me. My grade is just SO boring, conforming, and just like everyone else. Which is horrible in my point of view. LALALALALALA...LMAO!.. I gotta go because I have absolulty nothing to talk about and people I actually do talk to online, might be getting on shortly, or else I will have to be getting off very shortly! Either way it works..shortly!!
