I can't sleep, the migraine put me out today, so I'm wiiiide awake..I'm up to 4 extra strength tylenol to try and stop it. Too bad it isnt working.  I've been hanging out with an old friend, past love lately. And a feeling I thought had gone away looong ago are coming back. And I can almost feel that he feels the same way too. But I'm stuck. Last time, I felt the flame extinguish, and the love die, and we separated. I hated that. I still do. I was such a horrible person, and if this guy reads this, then I'm apologizing. I'm so lost though, as to what to do.   Feelings for a lot of ex-somethings are coming back, and for some reason I'm scrambling to get all my friends back. Maybe I'm getting paranoid again. Maybe I just don't want to be alone. I dont know and I wish I did.   35 days till winnipeg. Maybe I'll be something.  I dont want to grow old alone, I dont want to grow old, end my pain now and gooooo......
