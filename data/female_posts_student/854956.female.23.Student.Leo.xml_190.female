So, we hung around a bit, and visited... but then I went on to my room to do a bit of studying for my lab final (which was Saturday)... and then fell asleep while watching TV.  Saturday I woke up to say goodbye to my family.  They were all going up to my Grandma's to visit and so Rob and Kathy could look at some of my Grandma and Aunt's furniture... (because my Aunt Mary is now living in Houston with her grandkids and my Grandma is moving here to San Antonio to live with my Aunt Judy) Okay, so I got done with my final sooner than I thought, and so I headed on over to visit with them in Kerrville for awhile.  We got back to SA around 5, and then Rob and Kathy rested a bit before going over to Robert and Terry's to visit with them and some other friends.  I stayed at home to vegetate and visit with my parents.  We watched  urlLink A Mighty Wind , and then played around with the  urlLink Eggstractor  that my Grandma sent to my Dad.  HAHAHAHAHA  Let's just say it's not as good as it seems on TV.  hehe  But it was fun for all who took a turn trying to "eggstract" some of the eggs.  :-)  Then Sunday was a LONG day.  It was my church's 100th Anniversary.  Yeah, it's hard to believe that it existed then... but alas!  It did.  And all that was out there was a bunch of farms and fields.  :-)  Needless to say, it was a BIG deal, and this is why we had about 8 people shy of 400!  Yeah, and our little church is only used to having about 125-150 on Sundays.  So, it was a new experience to be sitting in the choir loft for church service.  Along with Ron and his brass quintet.  It was... loud.  But fun... and it turned out that my brother knew the tuba player.  They went to Roosevelt together.  After the service there was a panoramic photo taken out back... and then a dinner and afternoon service about the church history and such after the lunch.  It was actually quite nice.  Me and Jamey spent a lot of time together, which was very nice... it brought back memories.  We also saw Daughn and Damian a short while.  They had just gotten back from their honeymoon cruise.  They said it was nice... and stayed for awhile to say hello... but then left to go home and open presents from the wedding.  They hadn't gotten a chance last weekend before they left for their cruise.  Okay... so, in my hang time with Jamey, she and I decided to go downtown on Friday night... we're going to go to Dick's and maybe a couple other bars.  :-)  She said she's going to find me a good man... and then look for a new one for her... ;)  HEHE  She's so funny!  As for this week... things are going okay.  Today was kinda hectic.  I had my last theory and my last music tech class today... then I went to go get snack and all... and then I went over to Wal-Mart to pick up a couple things.  While I was at Wal-Mart I got a phone call telling me I had to go to another site for awhile.  That was interesting... first of all... I couldn't find it!  It was WAY down 1604 off Potranko... (that's a ways past Sea World for those that don't know) yeah, and I tried finding it on my map... but my map is like, 3-5 years old... and that school and the street the school's on... doesn't exist on it!  The neighborhood is only like, 2 years old.  So I had to call my Mom and get her help from a newer map that she had in her car.  But, when I got there, I immediately felt less stressed... and when the kids got there, they were so sweet!  I got like, 4 drawings in the hour that I was there!  Then when I finally got back to my site (30 minutes away from Mary Michaels Elem) the kids were so happy to see me... they thought I had quit and left w/o saying goodbye.  It was cute.  Steve was there... that's interesting.  It's weird to be around him... now that I don't have a crush on him anymore.  He ran into me today... that was odd... he was doing it to "prove a point" or something... hmmm.  Anyhow... that's all for now.  :-)
