Anyhow, at this island we had to burrow down deep (like 2 miles) into this rock so we'd be safe.  We found a lagoon in the core of the cave except the walls were made out of cooked salmon-esqe smooshy flaky stuff so it was hard to keep them out.  We all had a rainbow color assigned to our powers and we used that to seal off the enterance we used to get into the cave.  Unfortunately the ghoulies came down into our cave and morphed into these ork-like creatures from LOTR and we had to fight them.  I hid behind a rock in the upper corner 'cause I'm a big chicken shit.  Anyhow, I had to fight the last ghoulie, who was my ex-boyf, Joe B. (see "You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks")  I flew down and I turned into this AWESOME green dragon with green flames shooting out of my mouth and I burned him but he cut off my tail and I fell and broke my back, he picked me up and was trying to repair me and I buried I knife up to the hilt in his hip.  Apparently this made him unevil and he fell in love with me, even though I was a dragon with no tail and a broken back....then I woke up.  I wish i could say I was making this shit up so that I would feel less wierd about it, but this is what I dream, every night I have wierd, crackhead dreams like this....what the hell?
