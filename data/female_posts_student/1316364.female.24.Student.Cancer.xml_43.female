I got to talk to Jesse via the internet and even talked him into calling home. We had a great time talking and I was very sad when our conversations ended but I do know that was can’t always talk for the whole day nonstop.   I also found out today that the ARMY screwed up on Jesse’s leave request. He looked a schedule of all leave requests up to the end of September, and he couldn’t find his name on it. He said he would look into it and see what can be done. They also made some changes at the camp Jesse is station at and move one of the other companies out and a new one in. Jesse said they were all used to a set routine and this new company wants to change everything around and the plans they have aren’t even logical. Jesse’s job for the ARMY is to troubleshoot the computer/networks/satellites and such, this other company wants him to do his job and be on guard duty at the same time, the catch is that his has to be on guard and troubleshoot solo (one man shifts). When he told me this all I could think of is how this plan won’t work. All I could do was tell Jesse to give it time, the other company will eventually see that this won’t work and try something new. All he can do is wait it out and hopefully everything will get back to working order. It really has to be frustrating to have to deal with what he has too; I know I couldn’t do it.    In other news, one of Jesse and Mine close family friends is finally coming home from his service overseas, but he wasn’t serving in Kuwait or Iraq, he was stationed in Korea. He is due to come home Wednesday. I am so happy that I finally get to see him after all this time. I am so stoked. We have a lot to catch up on, too much time has gone by.  I guess if I can’t have my husband home, one of our close family friends will do.  Its funny how things tend to work themselves out.
