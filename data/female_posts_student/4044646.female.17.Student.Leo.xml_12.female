But went throught the usual in everyclass... fill this out, lets talk about this, whats your name...yatta yatta yatta..meh then the occasional 1st group assignment... lol but i know one things for sure.. Im not going to have to worry about the difficulty of the classes. Lunch was a new experience; you see they've down sized the portioning of the food so you if you wish to buy fries you get about half the normal amount, and what gets me is they keep the price the same eventhough your getting less??? I ono plus they've changed the dress code.. see now anything thats seen as "gang" related is not alowed to be worn like for an example: colored shoe laces, hoodies or any thing with hoods in generall... i dunno this whole thing sucks already... But It was funny when I went to go sit in senior patio.. you see the cafeteria's pretty packed and so the freshmen see this whole area untouched and think they can sit there... well no not possible cause thats reseved for seniors only so it felt great telling the fish they cant sit there and they have to move.. ahh the powers of being a senior, lol... that was the highlight of my day, lol but newho im about to eat dinner so i'll see yalls lata  audios
