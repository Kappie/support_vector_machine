When my day was crappy, she made it better,   Thanks sweetie, I love it, it brightens my day, everyday.   Why did I choose this,  well my friend urlLink  ~ Lori ~  and I have great ideas that include Scrapbooking.  This is not very popular in Montreal yet and we have such amazing craft ideas.  Right now, we can't really talk about them because some of these ideas will be a first its kind.  But when everything is said and done, you know.  We will have a web site, that hopefully  urlLink  ~ Sandee ~ can design for us... So ALL of us can make of few extra dollars.  Anyways, in the mean time, we are having a blast researching this.  What a hoot !!!  On this cold (what else is new) day.................Be Good
