I felt pretty akward. but today I got to go to hot topic and convince my dad to buy me some dickies since I'm now broke from paying for a $50 camera bag yesterday. worth it, but expensive.  I have a huge paper due in history tomorrow looming over my head. hope I get done with that soon. I've still got other homework to do.
