I had no idea I was up to that many, but I guess I'm not really all that surprised, what with the complete lack of things I have to do in my free time.  Okay, I have a few things to say. If you don't know me and/or are not going to Costa Rica or anywhere on a missions trip or haven't gone on any kind of missions trip in the past, this probably won't make sense to you, but it needs to be said, and I will most likely be reiterating it at the meeting that we ARE having at Connor's house at 4:30 on Thursday this week.  I really am just about done with this whole Costa Rica thing. Don't get me wrong, I am SO excited to go this summer, I am, and I'm really really really looking forward to it. I just really did not think that preparing a freaking MIME would turn out to be such a huge soap opera. We can't let any disagreements we for some reason may have about who is ORGANIZING WHEN WE ARE MEETING TO PRACTICE IT get in the way of WHY we're doing it and WHO we are doing it for. It's not about US. We need to stop taking out any last-few-days-of-school issues or family issues or ANY kind of issues that we may have out on each other. It's just going to get us more and more frustrated with each other and make working together on this mime and anything else regarding this missions trip even harder. How is it going to look if we show up in Costa Rica and we can't stand being around each other and the only reason we're doing anything is to get it done with? What's our verse, again? "My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ." Colossians 2:2. How is a bunch of people who are pissed at each other all the time going to encourage anybody in their hearts or unite anyone in love? We're supposed to set an example for them. We're supposed to be Christlike. And I personally don't think that Jesus would be making such a huge stink about when and where we're meeting to practice a simple mime that is meant to spread the Gospel. We have to work TOGETHER, and even if we meet a hundred times before we go, IT WILL NOT COME TOGETHER IF WE DO NOT COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER.   That said, I want to apologize if I've bit anyone's head off in the last couple of days. I've been pretty stressed out about school and grades and friends have been getting mad at me left and right because I don't talk to them or I don't call them and when the whole thing with the mime hit I just couldn't take it anymore. That's not an excuse at all, of course, but now you know what's wrong with me.
