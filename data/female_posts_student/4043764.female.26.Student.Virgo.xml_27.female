I mean, rock star marries someone who was barely legal when he started dating her? Oh, *that's* news. Yes, sometimes I read my own blog. And when I read the shite, it makes me wonder why I even thought to write.  Anyway, this weekend was all about organizing my stuff for the move. I don't have much stuff. I have not acquired much stuff. But for some reason, I spent at least 10 hours at boy's house this weekend. (There was no fellatio involved, but thanks for your concern.)  The first day, I went through my two closets' worth of stuff - and got this tremendous headache from all the dust. Perhaps I've mentioned that I am complete slob, but boy takes the cake. He's just got a lot of stuff and acquires more when he feels like crap. Lately, he's been buying A LOT of stuff.  The first few hours, I looked at clothes and decided that most things needed to be donated to the thrift store. These items included several articles of clothing purchased by boy during some rocky phases in the relationship. He would come in the room, look at the bag and say, "You're throwing THIS away too?" "Well, I don't wear it." "You know, I put a lot of thought into these gifts." "I know, but I'm moving to Boston. When would I wear an intricately hand-embroidered nylon Haitian boubou? I would look like Mrs. Roper." He takes the garish dress and rubs the fabric between his fingers. He gave it to me 3 years ago when he came back from winter break in Haiti (for thesis work), as a peace offering. He had broken my heart and went away. I went to Montreal; I had tried to forget about him. And then he came with this boubou. It was in a Barbancourt box - best rum ever - so imagine my surprise when I pulled out the dress.  "Maybe Paula would wear it, you know, since she's pregnant and all..." "Nylon? She might be pregnant, but she hasn't lost her mind." "Ok, maybe you're right." I later showed it to atlblingbling, who snatched it up immediately: "My mom would love this. She would be all, 'wow! it's hand-embroidered! and gee, it's beautiful.'" Hey, knock yourself out.  "Hey, boy, I think I am going to throw this t-shirt in the donation bag. Unless you want it. For the memories." This t-shirt was given to me one night during the post-Haiti transition. He had come back and decided that he had made a big mistake and wanted to re-kindle the relationship. That night, I was talking on the phone to my new little man friend, boy showed up at the door, a little tipsy, eyes all droopy and watery.  "I tried to call, but your line was busy." He holds his hands at the side. There is a bag in his hands. I figure he is from one of his little sadness shopping sprees. "That's because I was on the phone." "Yeah, I figured that. But I wanted to see you." Silence. "Here I am. Have you been drinking?" "Just a little bit. Three. Four. Basses. Hey. I brought you a gift." He had just been to a hockey game with one of our "professors" - will not explain quotes at this time - in an effort to compartmentalize, his favorite hobby. He pulls a t-shirt out of a bag from Philips Arena. It reads, "Hockey love. Can you feel it?" There is a heart on it. It made him think of me. Because he hearts me. He thinks it's cute. I think he's drunk. So I look at it and thank him for the gift. I spy the size - large - on the tag.  "Large? Did you mean to get large?" "Well, the small one seemed waaaaaaay too small." At this point, I explain the concept of the baby tee to him. He seems puzzled at first but soon catches on. He hangs his head because he is disappointed. He had no way of knowing. I tell him to cheer up, I really like it, it's cute. Blah blah. Maybe it will shrink in the machine.  As he sees me tossing all those thoughtful gifts into the trash, he pretends not to care and tells me: "If that's what you need to do as part of the process..." I am not sure what process he's talking about, but I guess he thinks that I am discarding items because of their sentimental value. Honestly, I just don't want a lot of junk when I move - I am keeping photos from our time together and other little things that matter. And don't take up space.  The second day of baby's big clean-up had me at his house at 11. He was on the roof - you know, doing all those "urgent" things instead of prioritizing and cleaning up for his mother's arrival - so I waved and went inside. The second I've begun plowing through my stuff, he calls my cell phone:  "So, what happened? You weren't going to say hello to me?" "I thought that's what the wave was..." "Oh, I thought you were mad at me."  What? "No, just wanted to start on my shit." "Anyway, can you come out and bring me a bucket of water? No. Just pass me the hose."  The day is a long one, where we both feel overwhelmed by our stuff and getting it organized. I have less stuff than he, so he is really beginning to get edgy about getting things done for mom's visit. This day, atlblingbling is getting my bed, and we have to do some back and forth with that. Boy goes to buy a replacement bed but arrives at the store too late - presumably because of me. He calls me when I am heading back to his house: "When will you be back? I am in a really bad mood. And I was wondering when you'll be out of here." "What are you talking about? I'm on my way. I just had to help unload the bed, got a drink... I really don't like your attitude. Could you fucking relax?" "Well, ok. But you had better hurry up. It's been 15 minutes."  I get there, annoyed that he's being snitty. What did he expect? I am moving away for a while and have to make sure that I've accounted for all my stuff...  So, I get there, start stacking things back into place. He is calling my name from the lower level of the house. I ignore him. I don't have time to talk. I have to get out. He runs up: "I'm sorry. You know I'm really stressed. I am not angry with you but about the fact that I needed to get that bed because I won't have time to do it during the week, and my mom is coming and the place is a mess and..." "Ok. Whatever."  We both start our cleaning. I suggest that we go out for drinks or food or whatever. It's a friendly gesture. I do not expect him to agree. He does, but within half an hour, he wants just drinks, and then 15 minutes later it's wine and bread in the house. Which is ok, because he is wearing me out with his little stressed-out routine...  We do finally sit down at the table and have this fabulous conversation about some other things we found when I was cleaning out my stuff. Things are getting cozy, he even seems - dare i say it? - happy until...  Princess calls. I was interested. I wanted to see what a boy-princess interaction might look like. It was not pretty. Since he is trying to avoid her. His side of the conversation went something like this: "I'm doing ok. Just tired." "No, I told you, I'm tired." "Well, getting some stuff done around the house." "Mhm." "Should be wrapping up soon." "Nothing's wrong. I'm fine!" "Some time this week. And my mother is coming this weekend." "I told you, I'm doing all right. I'm just stressed and tired." "Nothing's wrong. I'm just doing my work." "Yes, I'll eat." "No, I'm going to bed early tonight." "How many times do I have to tell you that I'm just stressed and tired?" And so on for about 15 minutes...  When he gets off the phone, he is no longer happy. I make a friendly statement about how you just need to tell people - including me, if need be - to just fuck off. If you don't want to talk, if you don't want to deal with a person because s/he is causing stress, tell 'em to go. He is all foul-faced and upset...  I grab my bags and prepare to go... I do not want to deal with sourpus and he does not want to deal with me. I walk out the door and he says, "You can't just leave like this." What the fuck is he talking about now?  "You can't leave me without giving me a hug..." Bah. Right. When is he going to get out of this mess?
