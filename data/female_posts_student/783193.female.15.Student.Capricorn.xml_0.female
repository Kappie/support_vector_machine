BUT she also brought back two friends, one of which is staying in MY room.. so i have to sleep on the ugly brown couch. poop. have you realized that school is almost here? summer has gone by really quickly. i think. and for the school year, i've resolved to be 100% organized and to keep my room clean for the entire 9 months. ugh. i'll probably break the resolution in.. about a week. maybe not the organizing part, though. i'm gonna keep a planner thingamajiggy. what a good plan, ya? later :)
