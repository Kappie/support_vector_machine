I got to sleep in till 9 this morning which was wonderful considering I haven't slept in that late for about two weeks.  I layed in bed and watched TV for about 2 hours until I got the motivation to go get dressed and start my day.  I didn't do much in the unpacking area.  But I had confirmation at 2.  I really enjoy confirmation and don't dread going to it like I did CCD last year.  It's nice to have the OG kids with us too.  Yes, their is a particular boy.  Gosh ya'll know me so well.  Renae, do you remember that band that played at the Battle of the Bands at Terrece Park?  Well, he is the drummer (yes the drummer, you know my weakness for the drums) of Bobjilolly or however you spell it or say it for that matter.  But I don't know if it's the O'Gorman education but he's really knowledgeable about our faith.  I like that.  My mother would call him a "nice catholic boy."  And he's cute, super nice and athletic, and plays the drums (2 points for that)  Nothing will ever happen with him but whatever I still like him.  Renae u would so approve! haha  Care to hear about my Joel issue....you have no choice.  See I met Joel when I was a freshmen and he was a senior at church in our Youth Council and he was always really nice to me but then he graduated and went to the Army but now he's back and going to school at Southeast I found out and every Sunday when I see him at church during mass or at confirmation he won't look at me nevertheless say hi.  But then when he does it's really sarcastic.  I don't know what his problem is but I'd like to find out.  FYI Erica you'd think Joel is really cute I know you would.    What else?  I can't really think of anything at the moment.    tata
