Screw hypocracy. *insert evil grin here* I'm a teenage girl and I'm allowed to speak my mind. I only pity the people who have to put up with me. But that doesn't mean I'm going to change. So what if I'm a hypocrit, who isn't in this screwed up thing we call life *insert evil laugh here, here, and here* Another update of the happiest shitty hypocrit you'll ever meet. )8-D  And hey, if you really "luv" someone, isn't it worth it to spell out the whole word? (Just something Mark once pointed out to me)
