She's been my friend since I was six months old. But I still had fun. Her family is a lot different from mine. They only listen to Christian music. Her dad was doing missionary work in Guatemala, when he was robbed and held at gunpoint for two hours. All that to help teach people about God.   I don't really believe in God that much anymore. I just can't bring myself to believe in some of the things they say in the Bible. Maybe I should read the whole thing.       It's weird. I actually want to go back to school to learn and have something to do. Usually, I just want to go back to see my friends. Only I don't want to go back without MJ, but there's nothing I can do about that. The other reason I don't want to go back is, I made enemies with the most popular guy in school. It's a really long story. He was my friend, which was weird because he was so popular. Now he probably hates me. That's how I want it to be though.       This year at school I'm going to focus on learning. I will try and learn as much as I can, and I'll try reading a lot again.I don't want to be a teacher's pet though. I hate most of my teacher's so I won't be.
