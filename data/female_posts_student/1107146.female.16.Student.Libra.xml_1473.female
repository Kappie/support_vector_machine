Rosie, What's this about you being the brains of the group?  Do you really believe that you are smarter than Z, Lindsey, and I.  I knew that you were egotistical and all (I'll never be prefect again, etc.) but to believe that you are smarter than Z, Lindsey, and me; this takes egotistical to a whole new level.  I have never met a teacher who could and would honestly say that they were smarter than this triumvirate.  And you seem to forget that the only reason Josh even appears to listen to you is to humor you.  Now that you've gotten me started,  when you attempt to communicate with some one, it is preferrable to use a languange that you both understand.  I spent ten minutes with your  ......hmmmm.....what happened to call me? Don't call me tonight....and finish harry potter now.  this has no more relation to english than does bad pig latin spoken by Migistra Shinkarev.  please attempt to make your writing more legible to  human  eyes.
