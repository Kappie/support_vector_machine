Do you ever feel like, sometimes, you've forgotten how to have conversations? Or is that just me? I had lunch with a co-worker today and I couldn't figure out what to talk about. Other than my kittens. But seriously, that gets old after a while. Well, for everyone else, that is. But I just... couldn't quite figure out how to make pleasant conversation. Anything she told me flew right back out of my head so I couldn't even encourage her to talk about... whatever it was she'd been talking about. I think it's just being tired. It's hard to sleep with kittens running across your body at 2 am.
