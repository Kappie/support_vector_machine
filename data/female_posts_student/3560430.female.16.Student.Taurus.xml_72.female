I have spent the better half of this afternoon picking berries and my arms tell me that they have never been so scratched in their lives (although I'm sure they have).   This should be really quick because I have to de-sweat and de-juice before I go to this BBQ today.   I had a really great talk with Bethie yesterday. It was great just to chat again. If you are big on the whole "allow same sex marriges" deel (as I am) then go check out laurell K hamilton's blog. I jsut read it and she is absolutely right.   Well again I must shower so Ciao!
