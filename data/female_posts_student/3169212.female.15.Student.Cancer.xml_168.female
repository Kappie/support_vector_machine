In what year(s) does it take place?  ...Another no comment to Baka and K. So... Baka... *evil smile* If I called you Dummkopf, you wouldn't be insulted, right? Same if I called you Nerfherder?  Actually, you get at least 90% of the information from the books. If he hasn't read them, he must not know ninety percent of it. Yup. All the more fun.  Well... I'm not much of a cake fan... How 'bout chocolate?    Bringing such a substance to a party would be incredibly insulting for some of us. I would rather not ingest any of it.    What? Like peanut butter is any better?    It is.    It's not candy! There's no sugar! It's too nutritious; it's a high source of protein! Wouldn't you rather get your serving of protein on something more expensive like ribs?    What is the point of spending a superfluous amount of money for actual meat? At our bases, we do not even have meat.    Yeah, well, enjoy it while you can! There's no point in training yourself to eat bad food when we live here most of the time.    Peanut butter is not bad food.    Neither is chocolate.    Chocolate has no nutritional value.    Peanut butter has no taste value.    It is not all about taste.    You're in America; of course it is!  Anyway... Sorry about that. But if y'all could convince her that she's wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it.  He does? Wow. I don't have many of his CDs anyway, so I don't think the video would do any good. But if I could get my hands on his song about dead puppies, that could be entertaining.  Well, Elizabeth, I'd help you get them out, but I have a particular grudge against Sparrow at the moment and my friend has a particular grudge against Turner-boy there. You're kinda on you on with that one unless anyone's feeling a bit friendlier than I am.
