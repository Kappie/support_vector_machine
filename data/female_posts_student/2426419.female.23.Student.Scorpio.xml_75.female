The lecture that I am giving is on the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, it this text Hume talks about how it is or is not possible to prove God's nature or attributes from what we see in the world.  One argument is that like things come from like things, if this is true then it would be very easy to see attributes of God in human life because God is creator (take the creator thing however you would like) and if we are we must be like God because of this.  Now this to me seems to be a decent idea but how much anthropomorphism is happening here.  We cannot say that God is like us but that we are like God.  So what does this do to our theology?  If we are to buy into this then it seems that it would affect a lot of areas.
