Bush of manipulating fears about security and terror for political gain.   The article goes on to quote Kerry directly:   "Home base for George Bush, as we saw to the nth degree in the press conference, is terror. Ask him a question, he's going to terror," Kerry said, referring to Bush's prime-time news conference on Tuesday.   In all fairness, I must post the Bush administration's response, also quoted in the article:   Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt called Kerry's comments "outrageous," saying, "They are the latest example of him playing politics with the most serious issue of our time: winning the war on terror."   I've said it here before, though perhaps a little disdainfully, and that is that EVERYTHING IS POLITICS.  Perhaps it is not for the best, but that is the way it is, and one cannot expect either Bush or Kerry to change the rules at this point in the game.  And as this is an issue, i.e. the war on terror, that I do hope people will be driven to vote on, then why shouldn't it be part of the political discussions we have in electing our leaders.  In other words, why shouldn't either candidate use this issue to get elected, since it is, in my opinion, the most important issue out there?    My main beef here, though, is with Kerry's suggestion that Bush is trying to make everything about terror.  Well, get a clue, because it is all about terror.  If the problem of terrorism isn't addressed now and eventually resolved (though I suspect the war will continue long after Bush's second term expires, assuming he is re-elected), then the rest of it really doesn't matter.  It is this lack of understanding that upsets me most about Kerry.  And this is the main reason I cannot support him in his run for President.
