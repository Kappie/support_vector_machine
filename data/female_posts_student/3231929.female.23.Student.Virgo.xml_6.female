I think I got a little dehydrated, so in typical British style I quenched my thirst on tea (a diuretic) whilst wearing quite warm clothes all afternoon. Added to the mixture was my leaving my tea rather late. I’m not sure whether it was me going a little hypoglycaemic or just dehydrated but as I cooked my tea, my knees were a little jellified and my hands shaking with a fine tremor.  Medicine is great isn’t it? What other subject gives me the know-how to diagnose myself? I tucked into my tea and started to feel better. That was until I had to jump up to answer the phone, it was my brother, so I decided he could be spoken to from the safety of the floor.  Davy and Kat are going on their holidays on a cruise around the Mediterranean at the weekend. It all sounded a bit middle aged to me but I kept my mouth shut. Mum is going to visit Ann on Saturday and staying there until returning home on Sunday. I will have to co-ordinate myself with her so I can get down to Stratford at an appropriate time to drop off the coffee and bath things I brought for Mum.  Mum was on the phone this evening too. She’d been in to see the accountant so the taxation side of things was getting clearer in her head. She now has a scheme to move up to Gran’s house to avoid paying some tax or other in the future. Her current house could easily be let out I think, well, certainly a lot easier than Gran’s house. I was glad she’d realised this herself and David supported her in her reasoning. As yet, she hasn’t raised the issue with Ann. I can’t help wonder whether she thinks, as I do, that Ann is more of a hassle in the equation of running the farm than a help. I think it was Gran who described her in the terms of “a little bit of knowledge being a dangerous thing”. Earlier today I put some photos up on here too.  Maybe this weekend I’ll dig out my elective photos and add a few of them.
