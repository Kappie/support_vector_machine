It is hard for me to find something out there I don't like and maybe that's why I get so pissed off so easily at people who are so damn critical of the mediums. But anyway, so I am sitting there reading through the various boards of the television shows at Television Without Pity. I am a lurker, I never post because I just don't care THAT much, so I am doing my normal lurker thing. My latest obsession is QAF so I am paying particular attention to those boards. So I read through the spoiler thread about how season 3 will kick off in like March... so long... DAMN SHOWTIME TO HELL!!! But anyway and then I jump over to the spoiler discussion thread to see what people are saying... HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD! There are some really angry people out there, I cannot get over how terribly upset they are over one little tidbit of information. I guess I would agree with them that the first season was the best and the second season, unfortunately, declined in comparison. I would also agree with them when they say that the writers (CowLip) are not surrounding themselves with honest people if they believe their show is only getting better. But Jesus CHRIST! There are some really angry people out there. Fortunately I find them good for a laugh but I just cannot believe how angry and stressed some of these people are. They sit there and berate the show, the writers and then berate each other if they have a difference of opinion with the majority of the posters. It is entertaining to read through. Someone on the board came up with the word "asstacular" and suddenly I was reading post after post about how brilliant this guy is. Now I have to admit normally I read through this guy's posts and he is quite smart, you can just tell with how he weaves dialogue but for him to be praised over and over for coming up with a juvenile word like "asstacular" just makes the whole experience all the more amusing! There are people over on those boards claiming to cancel Showtime and some are throwing out how much they hate the show and have hated it since the end of the first season... okay, well fine. So hate it. So that's fine. I don't care... but if you hate it so much, why are you still watching it and why haven't you cancelled showtime? I just find it all humorous! :) [ Tue Oct 01, 02:26:13 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I fuckin hate some of the arrogant asshole sales guys here... CANNOT WAIT TO LEAVE!!!

[ Tue Oct 01, 11:58:21 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] The major question plaguing (did I spell that right) me this hour is WHERE THE HELL DO I WANT TO GO FOR LUNCH??? The answer? I have no idea. But I am hungry and I need to take my full hour to work on my Music Theory Homework... anyone jealous yet? And you want to know what I am doing this weekend??? I am going to write my paper on why Hemmingway was such a misogynist (sp?). [ Tue Oct 01, 11:48:23 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] DID I MENTION WE GOT PHISH TICKETS????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [ Tue Oct 01, 11:46:54 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Wedding Story (cont.)   So anyway, we go to the reception and get seated at this table with these fun people. We meet Bill and this guy we called the preacher and Bill's date (can't remember her name). At first Beth and Bill seem to be chatting it up and hitting it off (the guy showed us where he got bit by a shark - it was a real bonding moment) and the next thing we know Liz is bored with talking to the preacher guy cause he's all boring as hell. So we all eat and then the bar inside FINALLY opens up and the bartenders (who didn't have Malibu rum outside when Beth asked for it) had picked up a bottle of Malibu just for her. We walked in and they remembered us right away and had the bottle ready for her. We finally made it out on the dance floor, after singing into our spoons and harmonizing on Shania's From This Moment. We actually harmonize quite well together, especially when spoons are involved :). So we're out dancing and Bill comes out to join us and the next thing we know Liz has monopolized Bill completely. Beth and I just have to laugh, it always goes this way! So after seeing Marshall time and time again and having a blast on the dance floor I am exhausted and we completely lost Liz to Bill, Beth and I decide we are not going to go out afterwards as planned but go back to the hotel instead. Liz on the other hand decides to go out. So when At Last comes on, I get all depressed, I just can;t hear it at weddings without getting sad for whatever reason, but I don't want to be depressed so I excuse myself to go have a cigarette. Beth comes out to join me after the song is over and we head home. We get the sweetest cab driver... so sweet. He opens our doors and talks with us the whole five minutes back to the hotel. Nice older gentleman. We get back to the hotel and change immediately. I am all psyched because Beth wanted to see QAF, but unfortunately we only got the one showtime channel so she couldn't see it. Too bad. It's such a damn good show. So we start out watching SNL and then decide to retire to our beds and then watch Trading Spaces and the next thing I know the girl is asleep and I am fading fast. WE ARE SUCH PARTY ANIMALS! Next thing I know, it's morning, breakfast arrives, Liz is home and we all veg for a while. We drive home, no traffic and get back in two hours. It was a blast and the trip was so much fun! But I have to say, unless I have another engagement like a wedding, I am not going back to DE anytime soon. :) But congrats to Marshall and Karin. Couldn't have happened to two nicer people.   :)  Erin [ Tue Oct 01, 10:25:58 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] What am I listening to?   Today I am listening to the vocal stylings of Maren Ord. LOVE HER! She has great songs and I can't get enough right now. I highly reccomend her to anyone who wants a nice ballad sound. She's great for work and her songs are just beautiful. She's contemporary and would fall under the category of pop, although she;s NOTHING like Britney Spears. Go check her out and give her stuff a listen.   Erin
