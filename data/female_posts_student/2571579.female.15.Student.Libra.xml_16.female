I ended up going for a run at 9 and it was really good but then I started to feel sick so i walked some and then finished up. It was getting kind of scary tho because i felt like someone was following me and the srteets around me have very few street lights..and also things were making weird noises that i didn't like. Anyway on my XC schudual i'm writing that i did 3 even tho it was probally less because i was suposta to 5 one day this week and i didn't do that =\  I think i'm gonna ask Carolyn if she wants to run with me when i have to do long ones like that. I feel bad not asking Krissie but i dont think I could keep up..I probally will ask tho.   I have work again .. 15 days left. just think it's all going towards my car which at the moment i want a white Jeep but we'll see how long that lasts and if i like it after i go for a test drive lol .. xoxo -Casey
