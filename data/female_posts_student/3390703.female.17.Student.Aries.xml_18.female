Ok, is it because of my fight with Ashleigh?  Or because everyone thinks that I cheated on Alex?  I need to know!  MeSsAgE fRoM aMaNdA: ... Something alogn the lines of "Did you have fun at prom with Bob?  ... Your're a bitch, I can't believe you cheated on my best friend!"  MeSsAgE fRoM tiFfAnY: Pretty much the same is Amanda!  Well, I didn't cheat on Alex!  I don't know why they would think something like that!  Did I ever give them reason to think I would cheat on him?  NO!  I like Alex a lot and I wouldn't do that to him!  If I wanted to be with someone else then I would have broken up with Alex, I wouldn't cheat on him!  I know how much that hurts and I wouldn't put him through that kind of pain!    But I guess I understand if they don't believe me!  I mean, with all the stuff that is going on with Ashleigh, I don't blame anyone for not trusting me!  I just wish that this could all be forgotten!  I'm really sorry about the whole Ashleigh thing!  No matter what I love her and she is always going to be my ULTIMATE best friend!  I'm sorry about giving Kyle stuff, and I'm never going to do it again!  Not that I'm going to have the chance because Ashleigh hates me with all the fires of hell!  I never meant to hurt her, I just don't think before I do!  And I'm sorry for being such a bitch to her at times, but I don't think she really realizes how much she means to me!  I bitch because I'm jealous and I'm not getting the attention I want!  I would do anything for her, I mean I would drop all my friends just to keep her!  Ahh, it doesn't matter anymore because it's all over now!  ... Oh yeah, Rachel just texted me and she said that the reason she doesn't want to be my friend anymore is because of a lot of things!   Gosh, why can't people tell me whats going on?  Why do people have to tell so many lies?  Why is everyone always getting involved in my life?  Don't they have their own lives to think about?  Come on, I'm not a bad perosn!  I don't want to hurt people!  I don't want people to hurt me!  I just want it to be like it used to be!  I want us all to be friends!
