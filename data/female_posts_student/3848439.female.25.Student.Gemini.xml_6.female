But "Glorious Appearing" looks to be a piece of jingoistic trash.   Note: I read the first book and a half, just so I could know what I'm railing against.  I haven't read any of the others, but I imagine I will check them out from the library at some point so I can speak with personal experience.  Check out this  urlLink op-ed article "Jesus and Jihad" from the New York Times  (you might have to register)
