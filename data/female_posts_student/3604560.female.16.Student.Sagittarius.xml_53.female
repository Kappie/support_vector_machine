Of course, the normal rules of going away apply: it would rain (hard) on the one day we decide to go away after virtually MONTHS of fine weather. I woke up at 5:30am to watch the sunrise and the @#%$#@# CLOUDS COVERED EVERYTHING! UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Sigh* well, you can't have everything, I guess.  The amazing thing about being home alone during the holidays is that you learn something new everyday. Like yesterday, I learned not to put a half-cooked egg in the microwave. Because it will explode. And not to put soy sauce in with the egg. Becuase it will explode SPECTACULARLY. Good thing I managed to clean up.  Tina, 10:15am it is. Meet at Central? Platform or outside? You know there are two ends so get on the 4th door from the end (or second last carriage) to get the escalators closest to the exit that goes to Broadway. Don't ask how I derived to that place. Did that sentence make any sense at all? Mel will have an opinionated answer, won't you? I have a system of boarding trains at particular carriages depending on the destination station, but that's starting to sound like a boring topic so I'll stop now... Divz, 3 weeks till Roswell comes out on DVD here! I can't wait! Marti, are you 17 yet? If you are...*sheepishly* Happy Birthday! Where did the word "sheepish" come from anyway? How does the act of being sheepish look anything like a sheep?  Hey Zheng, congrats. Although, pedestrians of the world beware. Natbat, do ya reckon it would be worth it to buy Spaceballs (sp?) on DVD for $15? Or should I get Robin Hood: Men In Tights instead? Do you reckon I'd like Spaceballs? Went to Beauty and the Beast On Ice last night. Wow! I know, I know, it's not for my age group, but still, it was really good. Some good skating! And the best bit of all was at the end of the show, this amazingly romantic guy proiposed to his girlfriend in front of the packed Superdome audience! They had a spotlight and gave him a microphone and he was so humble and it was really cool and the whole stadium all cheered and 'awwwww'-ed and she said yes! (She woulda gotten such a dissing from the crowd if she said no!) Well, toodles for now If I don't check in again, see ya at school! I'm trying to sound excited even though I've no virtually no work. Halfway through Pride and Prjudice though, Yay me!  Namárië
