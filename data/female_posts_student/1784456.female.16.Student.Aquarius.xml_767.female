Oh hail to the weird hippy who Izzy apparantly is. (We haven't figured out if it's just another one of her disguises yet!) Uhuh, so how's life the universe and every thing? Pretty much ok over here, apart from my mum says I should get more sleep... even though I sleep 9 hours! Oh and Izzy thinks she's stopped growing and she's all sad about it. Aww, poor Izzy. Guess you'll just have to join the Small Peopl Annonymous club, apart from you won't be annonymous cause you're small... Don't worry about it! I'ld rather be you're height! At least the boys aren't afraid that you might kick them by accident because your legs are sooo long! But hey you're not that small any way! Ahh I'm digging myself into a hole again! Eeeek better go do History homework. Go admaze yourself, do some thing you're afraid of doing.
