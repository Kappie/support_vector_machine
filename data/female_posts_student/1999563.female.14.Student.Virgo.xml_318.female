Very humble. Its kind like ALL the girls at the concert fell in love with him but he didn't care. It wasn't important to him. Sure, he could have any girl he wants but all he wants right now is GOD. And thats why I like him.  Oh, and he uses the same picks in the SAME COLOR as Jon from Switchfoot :)  Now to Tom, he is the nicest person on the earth. He is the other guitarist. He was so kind to me. He was all tlaking ot his friends but he spent time to talk to me. He wanted to know like how I was and what my name was. Then, I saw him later that night and he was like "Bye Laura!!" And I was like, Wow. He remembered my name. The time I needed someone to make me feel important, Tom was there. He made me feel happy....he made me feel like I had worth and that I was important to him. It made smile all over.  Jessy is really nice too!!!  His girlfriend was SO coool. I felt kind sorry for her though, all these girls were stalking Jessy everywhere.   The drummer (I for got his name *waa*) ws SO cool! I got to talk to him for like 10 minutes at the intermission. We talked about signitures. :) He was like "Wow, my signiture is ugly" and I was like "Well, don't you ever practice signing autographs?" And he was like "No.." and I was like "If I ever get famous I am going to practice my autograph a billion times and make it look REALLY cool so people wil remember me by it" and he was like "Wow...thats a good idea" and Jessy was like "Yeah..that is, I should try that!"   Haha. They make me so happy.  Then the turntable guy was nice too, but I didn't get to talk to him for very long. I was being quized by there Bass man to try to learn everyone in the bands names. But, his training obviously didn't work to well *wink*  He was like "Okay, this is *insert turntable mans name here* what does he do?" and I as like "OOh!! i know this one!" then I go he goes *wooogie wooogie* then I didn't the little turrntable sign with by hands. Hahha. Bass man started laughing then he kept going *woogie* *woogie*   Hahha.  What a fun night.  But, the reason I love faling up most of all is because there main focus is GOD!  I should have pictures up on my website by tomorrow.  homepage.mac.com/onegrlrev
