       
      Went to a birthday party for a couple who are turning 80 and 81 on April 1 and 5 respectively.  I gave the 80-year-old a big hug.  Haven't seen him for several months.  He started to cry and seemed so happy to see me there.  For the first time, he really looked old to me.   More to come...
