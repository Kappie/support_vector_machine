Lie right now Im listening to catch-22, which is not mood fitting at all. ska doesnt really help. meep. lyrics, they just seem to make you be able to explain yourself so much better. because ya know, feelings and emotions, suck. they just do. and i wish i was jaded right now. cuz um, right now, the word CONFUSION with a huge arrow in neon is above my head. oh my wouldn't that be nice if our feelings were posted above us? then we'd know when not to ask HEY HOW ARE YOU? when someone's sign said 'SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED, ALMOST OVER THE EDGE' cuz ya know we may trigger something. yes, rambling when nervous.   bbye
