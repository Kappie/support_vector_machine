Am in media at the moment, and am really quite bored, had better go and do some work in a minuter, otherwise I could be in for a ticking off from CJ!!!  Laura and Samantha are busy working, at least i think they are, Laura is currently having an argument with her mouse, it keeps on sticking to the table!!!  Tis very funny, think I might give her a book to lean on, hang on...she diddnt want it!!!  She thinks she wants to go to sleep.  Ummmm lardy da!!  xx
