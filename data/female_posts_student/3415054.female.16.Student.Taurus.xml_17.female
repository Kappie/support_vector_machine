But I gotta chill w/ all them.. Its rather funny.. his grandfather was like go ask ur wife for money insteada me.. n his dad is like talkin bout buildin me and Justin a house. His lil sister is set on us gettin married.. and I love the fact that his whole family is talkin that way too. I mean yah its kinda scary n an aspect but in another its like they can see me n the picture for a LONG time ago. so yah.. Then we were drivin home last night and his lil sister hada go to the bathroom so I ran her into the bathroom and his dad was like yah the kids really love you. besides Dana ( this chic who was like almost their step mom ) your like the female they talk about the most.. That itself meant so much. Its like not only do I have Justins love but I got his whole familys. I LOVE THEM SOO MUCH! hell Kasey gave me this ring she won at an arcade n I wear it on my right hand and Justins promise ring on my left.. and like I told him tonite.. my wearing of the rings should show him Im not only dedicated to him but his family as well.. OH well. no sense in ramblin on n on about my love for him.. cuz I love him soo much! but yah.. anyways. hes been my life pretty much for the past week.. but I gotta work tomorrow from like 9-2 and then I gotta babysit from like 6:30 till like 11. But its just the baby so that wont be any problem. Shes like 6 months n goes to sleep at like 7 so yah. But anywho.. I talked to Blake tonight and hes not havin any luck w/ the girls.. which really makes me sad.. I love that kid so much more than hell ever kno.. hes an amazin guy.. hell hes the 1st guy I fell in love w/ and hes made me realize so many more things about myself than anyone else.. oh well.. he was my 1st kiss n 1st love but now Im madly in love w/ Justin. but speakin of Justin Ima call him cuz for the past few minutes Ive been callin myself w/ the 404 area code. lol yeah Im blonde. lol well Justins confusin me n Im tired so good night! mwah!
