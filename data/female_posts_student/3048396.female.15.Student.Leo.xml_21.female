First Sunday I've missed church probably since last August. *Sigh* Yeah. Well when I did finally get up, Mom and I went and cleaned the Library. Cassie came when we were almost done cuz we had to watch her all afternoon while Donnie and Leslie went up to the flea markets. So when that was done we came home and played dolls with Cassie for awhile since I haven't played with her in awhile and then we started cleaning everything out of this room. And we got everything out. It looks so big now! I can't believe how big it really is. So hopefully soon after we eat we'll go over to Donnie's and get the couch...and then my Dad will attempt to set up wires so when we do get a TV it will all be ready. Then all we need is a door. I don't think we'll get a full door...just a half one like my Aunt Merna Rae has. Its good enough. So yeah...I probably should get going so I can go work somemore. Catch ya later.
