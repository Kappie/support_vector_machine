Its only seven thirty.  "Do you want to check your IMs?"  "Uh? What?"  "I'm going to disconnect your computer from the internet."  What the fuck?! Okay. Not only this, but yesterday she unplugged the keyboard,  Took my cell phone,  And yelled at me for an hour.  So, I get up. Go to check my e-mail and get the directions for the girls that have to come over today...  AND THE FUCKING COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF.  Why does she keep turning it off?!  Its my computer!  First the keyboard. Then the modem... AND NOW YOU'RE TURNING IT OFF?  What the hell.  I give up. I'm pissed.  And on top of that, there were three really important voicemails that I didnt get because she had to be all high and mighty and take my cell phone.  [Screams]
