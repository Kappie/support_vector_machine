TOTALLY   wrong. it was really wierd. i felt guilty. as he talked, i realised things that i never even bothered to entertain in my small, closed world. honestly, i was viewing the world in a stereotyped manner. anything that didnt fit into my stereotype, i dont entertain. my mind was open yesterday. i was truly listening. i couldnt help but cry as he narrated some things to us. i was sitting the closest to him. and seeing such a formidable figure shed tears, i felt helpless myself. went home feeling profoundly full of confidence. that i can achieve if i wanted. so far, i had only been saying these things to myself. now i know the true meaning. i guess you are wondering what happened and why i am talking all this stuff. a life changing experience occured yesterday. and i told him sorrry for making him cry. felt bad.  when we can stage such a big show with cooperation, we can get countless A's also.. i totally agree.    i made a decision yesterday. concerning a very important dramatis persona who graces the stage of my life. many scences revolve about the person. to put it simply, i have decided to let go. dont get me wrong. i am not attached. just let the person slip by. a conscious decision i have made. its gonna hurt. i did have a choice. and made mine.      i think i am growing up. talkin very seriously these days.      haha. am truly laughin today.      bubbye shadow.
