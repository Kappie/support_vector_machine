That sounds quite strange, but the fact is, my eyesight has deteriorated quite a lot over the six years I've been at Uni, yet I've come to rely on them more and more for almost every activity of my life. When I was working at the bookshop, I could read without glasses most of the time because I only read for around an hour a day -- the rest of the day I was serving customers. However, let's take a look at my eye tally now:  My daily activities include writing my thesis, I am at uni for 8-10 hours per day, normally 5 days per week (sometimes 6). Around 6 of those hours are in front of a computer screen, including research, writing, surfing for news, emailing (i.e. work related). Around one hour is spent reading. Another hour studying Chinese. Possibly another hour paper shuffling, printing, organising, meeting supervisors etc. I also take some tutorials but that's hardly any time. Then some time mucking around eating lunch. And then some time online mucking around. That's around 7-9 hours per day of eye work. Aerobics a few days a week, which is a great eye rest and (this class anyway) workout. My extracurricular activities then include watching movies (eyes), reading classics (eyes, small print), reading rubbish (eyes), playing computer games (eyes), bible study (eyes)... hmmm, and aerobics (no eyes! well... comparatively), canoeing (no eyes, but I don't have a car now so I can't get my canoe anywhere), sewing (no eyes, but my sewing machine died), group bible study/prayer (no eyes!).  Nerd Alert!! I need some more no eyes life! I have big headaches from too much time in front of a screen. One option is to exchange my studying Chinese time for speaking Chinese -- call some friends and get out a bit! Actually friends are a great idea. And exercise is good. And I shouldn't eat my lunch in front of the computer.  Any other suggestions for my nerdy thesis-related life?  I don't study on Sundays, except for Chinese; but since watching movies and playing computer games are all eye related "I feel like I need something else".  I guess I also spend a lot of time doing housework in the weekend but that's really not cool.  Here's a great quote: Everything is for the eye these days - TV, Life, Look, the movies. Nothing is just for the mind. The next generation will have eyeballs as big as cantaloupes and no brain at all. -Fred Allen  ( urlLink http://wordsmith.org )
