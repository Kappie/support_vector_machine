Im just plastic,u see.I smile to everyone i noe..well almost.But actually i havent moved on yet.I still cant accept the fact tt God took my grandfather away frm me 3 wks ago.. I really love him with all my heart.I took care of him during the sch holidays..and i still cant believe he's realli gone!! Life's pretty fucked up now that i wake up every morning and realising tat i dun have to go back to my childhood home to visit my grandfather animre..i miss him so much,my hart bleeds..God,if ur hearing my prayers rite now, at the very least,put him amg those you love and tell him to look down on me everyday.and tell him too, that i really love him.Cos every smile i put on my face,its just to hide my running tears.Therefore,im plastic..  My Day 15/7/06 Pretty sucky.Fucked up as usual.Hate those bloody younger girls who have a problem with me over someting im not aware of.Started off when this particular gerl wanted to slap me,cos i was telling nana(my bes bud) that "eh pmpan tu jln kengkang"..I was referring to a teacher of ours..not this 14 yr old gerl!She apparently,terasa sgt and wanted to slap me.Yeah rite..I'll fuck her upside down if she did.Like she dared anyway.Fuck her.And her bloody friend  the parents who fought with nana.Revenge gonna be sweet. "Berdiam diri bukan ertinya kau kalah"   I regretted my decision.Shldnt have told khairul that.Now he hasnt smses me yet even though he said he gonna sms me last nite.He didnt till now..Guys..Ur all the same.. Khairul is just some other guy whom everyone wld say Handsome bt he has his bad points. Kept me waiting 4 2 hrs the last time i went out with him.And after i left the place,then he arrived.I hate those type of ppl, bt why do i like this guy? God,get him out of my head.Sometimes,i just wish i will hate guys..Guys are the downfall of me.I hate them so much at times.Im being practical here.I just seem to meet the wrong guys in life.Cos all they're after for is just my body.Not kidding.And i fucking hate that.So now,Im trying my best to fucking hate guys.Cos ur all the same. Peace out~
