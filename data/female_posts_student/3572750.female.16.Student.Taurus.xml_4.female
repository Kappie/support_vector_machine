Never did get to go shopping with Patricia before she graded. Won't have Sug to help me with my math. No Shawn to walk home with. I guess it has all just gone by so fast. I remember being a grade 8 like yesterday. I remember my first crush, first locker, etc. It feels weird that I'm almost in gr 11. I always looked up to the older grades the gr 11's and 12's when I was younger they looked so much older. When I see my self I still look so young. I'm not mature, not pretty, just well me. I'm not sad that grade 10's over, just can't wait for the changes to come.
