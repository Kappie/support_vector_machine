I gave my "innocence" ( Or what I had of it) to my boyfriend of a lil' over 9 months ( at the time it was 7 1/2). I lost my virginity (Sexual intercourse)on May 2nd ,2004. I do not regret it and even through I lost it on my couch, I wouldnt change it for the world. My feelings for Steven are more than love as of now. I feel complete, whole, and alive. I do have "wandering" eyes and wonder how it might feel with...maybe a different guy, but for now, I've remained faithful. I hope to continue to be. I love him and I want to marry him, and althrough I'm only 15 ( 16 on Dec. 3rd) I know what I want, and I believe I obtain the maturity to mold my future wisely. I'm still just a teenager and I realize for the most part that Steven and I wont be together for all of our lives, but I do  believe  that if we split paths in life, somehow we will end up with each other in marriage. I love him, and he's helped me through alot. He helped me realized that all men arent like my father and not every single human that has a penis will abandon me when I love him. I thank him for that. Even if we break up, I wont ever say that I regret having sex with him, because for me it wasnt SEX...to me it was making love and giving him everything I am for us to connect. If we do split, I'll still know that at least THEN we were in love. I'll always love him no matter what I do, or he does. We're human, we F*U*C*K up, it happens, but forgiveness is not my strong point. As for the rest of my life, my dad abandoned me at the age of fourteen, but it didnt start that way. *sigh* Looking back, I was such a "Daddy's girl", I loved him completely and felt safe when I was with my father ( which is one of the things I love about Steven). Then my father got stationed at Killen and we didnt want to move ,and the commute was too far to come home every day, so instead he got an apartment there with one of his co-workers named Frank ( very nice man with a family basically in the same situation as my father..commute too long and such), and they shared the rent. My father came home every weekend after work, and this worked out for a year. It was straining, but at least I had time with him.*sigh* After that, he was sent to Utah, and my mother refused to move because of the case of young girls being kidnapped, raped, or taken by Mormons, so my father tried hard to get a different place. *sigh* Looking back, I wished we just moved to Utah. I would've gotten over moving away from everything. (sorry, I'm crying)*sigh* Anyways, then he found a job that was okay. Since he was bi-lingual, he was able to go to a remote location for a year ( remote meaning he cant take his family there)...we thought why not, it's just a year and he could visit. Honduras was the place. *crying* I hate that place..I really hate it.  *sigh* Anyways, we went the airport on Feb. 17,2003. We cried so much. I wish I wouldnt have let him on the plane...I REALLY wish that day was completely erased out of time. Well, once he got there..things were okay. He called every now and then, but then...after like a month or two, he didnt call...or if he did he was drunk off his ass ( and my father never drank) and then he went clubbing and partying ( and my dad was usually the type of person you see standing in a corner at a party that FORCED to go to)...then he only called to fight with my mom. My First Day of my first YEAR of highschool...everyone called to asks how it went. Except my father. Oh, he showed up on the phone drunk about 2-3 weeks after that, but he never called for me. I felt torn..I felt like my dad wasnt talking to me because I was bad, or not good enough or not worthy...whatever the case. I felt horriable. I loved my father, I had the best relationship in the WHOLE world with my daddy. I loved my daddy! and here he was...not talking to me. I told my mom, and she had me call him. It took a couple weeks to get ahold of him...b/c he wasnt in his room...at 3 A.M. When I did get to talk to him, I cried...I couldnt do anything except cry and tell him that I missed him and I thought he didnt love me..and I cried. ( i dont cry about things..but I couldnt help it). He said he'd start paying attention to me, that lasted all of the entire 2 days! Finally in early Sept of 2004, I had enough and since he closed all the doors of communication to me, I finally walking across the river and burned the bridge. Later on Sept 24th, I got with my current boyfriend Steven. A day later, I think, my mom got a phone call from a lady( I wont ever call her that after this) in Honduras tell my mother to divorce my father because she was a "Christian women" and it didnt look nice for her to be with a married man, also that my father had a house there with her( which isnt allowed by the Army base to have a house outside because it's a remote location) where HE provided for her and her child ( not my father's). My mom was a wreak obviously. My world shattered and burned beneath me. I learned more of Honduras, and I learned that surrounding the base of where my father was at was whores...and lots of them. The are called something in spanish that when you translate it to English it's basically means "the Spiders". they are named this because when the base doesnt allow their gates to be swung open to the many whores, they climg the walls like spiders to get in. What a classy whore my father has. The base knows what's going on..but no one does anything. NO ONE! It pisses me off. Well, alot of time has passed. Here's a flash-forward. My father came in March, shut down our cable,light, water, and stole alot of money from my mother's account. lovely huh? And then after he was safely back in HOnduras, my mother was served with a divorce paper. It all comes out to her at one time. My poor mom, but she stood her ground. She got a great lawyer, and then went to court June 11 2004 for the divorce. My father's lawyer wanted to leave my mom with barely enough money to pay the house, the car, and feed herself ( let alone feed me), and on top of that...the lawyer wanted to force my mom to pay HALF of my dad's debts (which 93% was spent on the whore). Luckily, My mom once again stood her ground. My mom's lawyer broke my father in two and now he barely has enough to feed himself...guess his whore will have to work overtime. My parents finalized the divorce that day. I'm happy but sad that the man I used to call Daddy is dead and the man that stands before everyone trashing my daddy's reputation is a pile shit that God will make sure gets what he deserves. My Daddy died Feb. 17th 2003. It's sad, but it's true. That is pretty much my life right now. My life in a (long) nutshell Real blue stays true Peace!
