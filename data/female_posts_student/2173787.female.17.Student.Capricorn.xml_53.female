The other half though was about camp and middle school and how i let friendships fail by saying I'll call tomorrow, or we can talk later.  It's scary how easily let people drift away to the recesses of my mind.  It is especially scary when i fast forward to two years from now.  I'll be in college and what will be of my friends now?  Will there still be impromptu gatherings in starbucks like the one we had today? Almost definitely Not...Will i even know them as who they are and who they used to be? I hope so... But I always say that I'll keep in touch. I have all of the numbers of the CILTs from my session but have i used them, no.  I told myself I'd keep up with the Gan Izzy counselors but that didn't happen, i don't even know what country most of them are living in now.  So how can i guarantee that I'll keep up with friends now?  This is depressing me... I wish I had some way of comforting myself.  Another thing that surprised me was what I didn't write about.  The prompt was "I remember..." but in all my writings I did not write about huddling on top of Mr. Meyers's car, I didn't write about filling Diana's car with balloons, I didn't write about our freshmen year water fights in the parking lot or taking over that tiny table at Armadillo and getting 6 refills of chips.  Neither did I write about celebrating Christmas with my Opa or Hanukkah with my Zayde, I didn't write about almost not making it across the border back into the US from Canada because my Aunt was joking around when the border guard was questioning us, I didn't write about all of the vacations my parents took me on, nor the fights I've had with them parents, and I didn't write about visiting my relatives in the hospital or losing my Aunt.  Instead I wrote about battle of the books and not having friends in 5th grade because I put all my eggs in one basket. I wrote about being glued to the spot on the dock when I first tried drill, and about how I walked my midnight run without being scared. I wrote about playing in the snow with Torey and dancing in the rain when I was her age.  Its odd that the stuff I hold dearest to me now did not go onto the page, yet it was all I could think of after getting the rest written down on paper.
