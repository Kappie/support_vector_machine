Sometimes i think too much and then the stuff i was really happy with all of a sudden i wasnt cause i thought of all of the bads things that can happen, i always done that, i sumtimes i wish i didnt cause i might can lose sumthing really good. Like with relationships, i thought about got happy and was ok ima do it, then i kept thinkin and was no, jus like with health science tech. i thoguht of all the work and stuff, but i mean i lost an oppertunity. I have to stop sumtimes, cause im doin it this very second, i dont know why, but maybe every time i thought sumthing good was gonna happen, it didnt, sum 1 didnt keep their promise or sum crap like that. I keep thinkin about all the possible bad stuff that can happen 2 me at franklin like i could get stabbed, or even jumped by sum gang but im not scared im just worried i mean if i get shot then wut. Then i keep thinkin about how im not goin 2 the same high school as none of my friends and that they will forget about me cause that happens 2 me alot, they stop calling or inviting me places, but then again i do to. But if i really wanna keep them then i wont. Im worried that since me and my bf arent goin i mean i trust em, but i mean wut if he finds naother girl there and drops me like he did to this other one, if i was her i would have tooken that out on him, but then again i cant take it out on no one, because im sure he didnt want to like the person on purpose, then again i dont kno that either, i wouldnt kno wut would go on in school, i would jus trust the person hope that they woudnt do me like that. But im not a jealous person i dont care as long as hes not cheating i dont care. I do but, no to that point where u can talk to no girl at all. I jus need sum 1 to talk 2 i wanna go home so i can talk 2 my momma ( yea i call her momma, so wut sue me). Im making my self sad lol, but then again i jus laugh it of which i hate doin sumtimes cause ppl dont always take u seriously. Im happy im leavin friday i cant be away from my house for to long, i dont like stayin down here with them except for my aunt or godmom, but i mean i cant do stuff my way, i mean they claim its my " second house" but i mean i sumtimes have to ask permission to eat, i mean give me a break, but i think thats because its two babies in the house but that doesnt mean that. And i cant really ell them i dont eat stuff like pork, i dont eat pork cause its not healthy, ( except 4 bacon once in a while, but not often) and i member i told them that and they looked at me like i was crazy, i dont eat hot dogs either, but my mom respects that, if she cooks and i dont like it, she'll let me eat sumthin else, but here its different, i dont care im not movin back down here, cause im stayin in nj for high school then im goin 2 califorina, so my dad can keep dreaming. I miss my mommy, i mean she is so easy to talk to, and she is nothin like my dad i, he is so like over protectingmtimes. But if i have any kinda problem i can talk to her, i mean even about my chores and stuff, she says im sneaky sum times cause i dont tell her everything at once, but im not i can be sneaky but in a bad way, like sneakin food in my room way. well i was kinda when i started having a bf, she didnt ask so i didnt tell her, but i guess she got the clue w/e its not big thing. I mean she like gives u all the freedom like a 14 yr. old can have only because she can trust me and she kno i wont do nuthin stupid. And its sad cause i never go no where, i mean there is no 1 2 play with outside, it always my sister goin 2 new brunswick, i couldnt cause i had 2 babysit. And im glad that if i do sumthin or left sumthin that she will be there, like the time when i had left my cap and gown at the lib. me and xianne thought we were goin back but then i went sumwhere and saw my mom to ask her if i could stay, she was like yea, then i was like but my cap and gown is at the lib. so she was like well go back and get it when u pick ur sister up so i said ok. So i got there and i wasnt there i was like omg where is it so i was up and down new brunswick lookin 4 it. I finally c my mom and she was all quiet, and i didnt wanna tell her yet until i called xianne to see if she had mine, well i get home and was like oh ya cap and gown in the house, i was like wut! omg u had me in this car worried when u had it. I was so relieved she always finds a way to get me, and she always fins out wut im doin, i mean she could be an 1 hr. away from me, i mean in a different state, btu she still kno, not the exact details, but she kno sumthin, thats kinda scary. Im not thinkin no more but im still worried, and i need to stop worrying my self about stuff like that cause its nuthin compared to other stuff like me being pregnant or getting a std or disease or sumthin serious like that.   But im gonna listen to my music cause that helps me out.
