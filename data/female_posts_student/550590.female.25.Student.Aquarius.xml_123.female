I'm just glad the week is over, funerals are expensive, stressful and anxiety producing.  Add that to almost a week out of the office, this coming week being the interns' last/first, having to fly, and not sleeping for 4 days and I'm ready for a vacation.  Poor Bruce got stuck babysitting all week after having to drive me to Orlando to meet my folks.  Oy.  I never thought I'd be glad to be back in Florida...sheesh.  By the way, for those of you who had been looking for the article about my grandfather, it's located at http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-loccfbriefs05120502dec05.story under Volusia County.  His name was Daniel Cardillo.
