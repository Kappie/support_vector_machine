Not that Gaia didn't need to go, with constant bad stomach for the past month (regardless of our dietary change attempts). But, I sort of was rather negative towards the vet. I mean, first of all, I've been there once before where he just gave her a peniciline injection without giving me a second to say no (sort of forgetting that he's not there to take decisions without asking first). And secondly, well... he's sort of like everyone else around here: MAINSTREAM! Which means that he was probably gonna flip out the minute we'd say that we make food ourselves, and just loose it when he'd hear that she was vegan. And then, probably blame her stomach problems on that, trying to sell us his own industrial brand, and giving us some horrible chemical treatment for the next 10 days...  But no! He proved me wrong!! Nice surprise, for a change... He was very open, didn't make a single comment about the homemade part, (and disn't ask about details, so we disn't mention the vegan part... ;-) ) and then proposed a full lab analysis. That felt so good! He actually seemed to be the one surprised when we said yes to the lab offer (more than 2000 kroner).  It seems like he gets a lot of those people that just have a hard time treating their pet as  a full member of the family...
