Anyways im grounded for sayin fuckin...yeah my dad...i dunno...i didnt do much of anything today just kinda hung around the house. i did go to blockbuster and get movies i re-rented the Texas Chainsaw Masscure and GRIND. GRIND FUCKIN ROCKS!!! i love that movie...it was kinda cheesey..but adam brody and bam are FUCKIN SEXY!! opps dad i said FUCKIN 3 FUCKIN times!! oh god no! but yeah then ben and terri came over but didnt stay cuz i was cleaning.
