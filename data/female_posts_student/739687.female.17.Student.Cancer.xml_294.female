The whole thing where I don't need sleep because it's summer. I just feel so euphoric and peaceful. So it's about eight right now...and I've been up for an hour already. Yup. Didn't fall asleep until four. But it's as if...three hours is enough.  Today is interesting. I feel a sense of anticipation...stupid anticipation, but it's somewhat odd like that. I dyed my hair auburn yesterday, it's interesting. Can't wait till tomorrow. But right now I need to concentrate on making it through today. Not to say that today is a bad thing...it's anything but.  I think it's funny how I am. I sit around and wait for something to happen to me. As if some miracle is going to just run up and smack me in the face. I wait for excitement to come to  me.  I create this image of perfection in my head and sit waiting for it to form into a reality. How silly and foolish.  But how normal.   I've been doing alot of thinking, as a result of my insomnia. It's good thinking though. (Wow...to note: after I typed that sentence, I noticed that it said "I've been doing alot of sleeping, as a result of my insomnia."........Lack of sleep isn't good.) I decided to read through my journal last night, because it was conveniently sitting on my dresser next to my bed. (Quelle coincidence...) It starts off positive, and yes it is for the most of it's entirety, pretty optimistic. But it starts off very religious. And it slowly strays from that. It simply goes to show where I headed over the past few years. I'm not saying that I regret how I've torn away from religion, because I don't regret it. I don't mock religion, nor do I think of it as  anything  negative (and I'm trying my best to get my point across, without offending half the universe...but hey...this  is   my  journal, and i can write freely my own opinions, and if anyone disagrees...I have a chatterbox for that), I simply feel that it doesn't accomodate my needs. I would go deeper into my opinions on religion, but I understand that it's a debatable subject, and I don't want to cause  too much  of a controversy over it. Religion isn't typically a subject I like to bring up, because I don't like to infringe on other people's beliefs too much, and I'm not out to try to "convert" anyone or anything. It's a subject that I  enjoy  discussing, but only with people who are a bit more open-minded, and not simply eager to bite my head off and smite me. You know.  Well...I like the fact that I changed subject at least 4 or 5 times.  I suppose that's what a lack of sleep can do to you.  I'm gonna head off and enjoy the day...because it is absolutely wonderful. :-)  Don't get in  too  much trouble with the law, crazies.
