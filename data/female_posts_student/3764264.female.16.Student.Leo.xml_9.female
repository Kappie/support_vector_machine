This is starting to wear thin on me. I want to see him so much. I feel like a little kid in a car ride. Theres no point in asking if I'm there yet, because I don't know where I'm going. I hope to god Erich is there too.   I'm angry. I was angry... at a stupid tv show and I wanted to cry, and i did. And I wanted erich here and he wasn't. ... I hate that. But it wasn't just the tv show anyway.   So I told someone else my troubles, after much...deliberation.  and though he was also far away, he offered me a platonically inclined hug. But...  I have a feeling, that what I need... is a real hug. That I can stay in and be all yay-i'm-hugging-someone-woo-hoo-party-on-(!!!)-sweet. But you see, the only person I could give a hug to like that is Erich.   The last time I gave a hug to someone else like that...I was terribly sad and he... well he wasn't. (He ended up grabbing my boob and something popped up...) And I can't really trust other people anymore, partially because of that.   So it's just Erich.  And I sure would love to talk to him about now... Or feel his arms around my waist.     ....     -Sage
