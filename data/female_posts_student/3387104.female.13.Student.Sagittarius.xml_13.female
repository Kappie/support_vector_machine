The day before yesterday we had an entrance examination, it was very easy, in dictation I made only 1 mistake--writing _ihn_ without _h_. The mistress said that didn't matter, I had only made a slip. That is quite true, for I know well enough that _ihn_ has an _h_ in it. We were both dressed in white with rose-coloured ribbons, and everyone believed we were sisters or at least cousins. It would be very nice to have a cousin. But it's still nicer to have a friend, for we can tell one another everything.
