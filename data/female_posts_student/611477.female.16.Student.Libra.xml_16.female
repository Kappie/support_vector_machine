It caused a few tangles, but I unraveled one of the shoulders to redo the neckline. I'll tackle the other in a few minutes. On the other end, I'm about... 5 inches past the short rows... but not much exists before the short rows. Huh.   Work, oh mystical picture!    I kinda like this pattern, but I'm concerned that after washing and losing some length it'll become too busy. Maybe I should've made it once every 8 rather than 4 rows. This scan is from the edges of the short rows... one of these sides. I'm not sure how to explain the wonkiness there. Maybe later.     Midnight edit... (Hey, it's my blog.  Why don't I just make a new post?) Facing the... front, that's the right side.  If I knew what I was doing I'd be able to explain what happened.  Nah.  So what I've got now is a bunch of stitches on one needle for the front neck-ish area. *Right below* that spot I cast on a bunch more stitches both sides to wrap around the back... yeah, yeah, I said I'd knit it in two pieces... guess not, now.  This sounded more different-er.  One piece, one seam on the back.  I'll figure out a way to make it a feature.  (On the back?)  I'm confusing myself again.... overcaffeinated late-night/early-morning rambles.  (At least I'm not driving around playing loud music.)   I'd restart and make sense but I have no idea what I'm typing about.  (Don't I have a different journal for this drivel?)
