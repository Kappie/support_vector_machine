And considering the fact that i don't do drugs or drink, most of it didn't actually pertain to me.   My mother gave me a lesson in driving.  The very first thing I did was basically drive up the hill on the side of the driveway.  Oops.  But, then we went around the block, and I was ok.  But I hated it.  So much.  I'll get better though, it was the first time.    Now, Princess Diaries.
