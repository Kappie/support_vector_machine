I can understand how I may be annoying but a lot of this shit is ridiculous. I think Nick's in a bad mood, maybe that would explain why I headed up to Kettering for nothing. Yes, I wasted 3 hours and a half a tank of gas to sit and play Rummy and Speed Solitaire with Colin for 30 minutes. Excitement. I was supposedly suppose to pick Nick up and head back down for sushi and Starbucks before heading to my concert. But he ended up coming down with my brother to fill vending machines and watch TV I guess. I have no clue. I really don't care. Henk missed the last performance in band that I'll have in the US. And I just wanted to say thank you...  Thank you for showing how much I mean to you. And thank you Nick for adding to the fact. Thank you all for almost ruining the night that was suppose to be perfect.   On a serious note, I'd like to thank Andee, David, Michelle, and Leah for actually being there for me. It means to world to me to know that there are people that actually care. I love you all.  Tomorrow. No Canada. No hanging out with Henk and Crew. Nothing. Everything will be nothing. Congratulations to me.  Nothing fails like success.
