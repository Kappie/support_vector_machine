Some people believe that we fall for people that have a special immune system that's different than ours.  Scientists believe that there is some sort of "radar" in us that allows humans to determine the best mate.  By choosing a mate with a good immune system, the children that are born become stronger.  The cycle repeats itself over and over again and humans gradually become stronger through breeding.  O.o;; This completely scarred me for a few days.  Does this mean that in order to be loved, one has to catch a lot of diseases and become immune to them.  Talk about being desperate.  And the thought of the fact that humans are breeding themselves is sort of disgusting...I guess this is what they call the cycle of life.  It's a harsh world out there.  Only the strong survive and the weak are left to die.
