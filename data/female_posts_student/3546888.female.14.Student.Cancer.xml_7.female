Joking! (They suck by the way. I know I'm from Los Angeles and all but really) I'm working on the whole discovering-what-I-am. And for the last time Nick (that is if you are reading this) I am not a Goth. Just clarifying that.  Some people say I'm close to emo others say I'm sk8er. (shows how much they know me. When I sk8 I spend more time with my face kissing the floor)   So, That's it. Hopefully...Raccoon alarm clock of doom!!! Sorry, bored.   adios random people. Katie the confused girl. ^ ^
