Friday, I stayed home and watched "Uner the Tuscan Sun" which made me want to get divorced, move to Italy, have sex with an Italian guy or two and then, while getting two crazy teenage lovers together, find the love of my life. Then, Saturday I went to the Jersey Gardens mall with Debra, Danielle and Ambro looking for prom dresses. I tried on this big poofy yellow one that was really great, I like loved it. If it wasn't yellow it would be like my dream wedding dress. But, yeah, I ended up buying two sweatshirts and a button down pink shirt and a tank top. No dress. Got some good ideas though. Then, Saturday night I hung out at Vin Fea's with Don, Rubin, and Nick. I beat Fea at pool   twice   and Rubin once. It was fun. I love those guys. They're awesome. Today was alright. Nothing too much worth blogging.  New comments system which is cool. Use it. Love it. Cherish it. x0x
