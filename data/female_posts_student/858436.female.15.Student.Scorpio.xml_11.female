I'm not upset about it. I'm the freshman rep. for Blue Crew, but that's not really a big deal. Haha.   Um, I think I bombed my Physics test, and I'm not sure about Geometry. I hate those classes. With a passion.  P.E. was hell today. We had to play volleyball and I felt like an idiot. Why? Because I suck at sports! Of course everyone else on my team was good at it, but I didn't get made fun of, which is nice. At least, they didn't make fun of me in  front  of me. Lol.  I'm going to visit my friend Mandy tomorrow! We're gonna ride and stuff. It'll be fun. :-)  I met a guy that I kinda like. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know I like him, at least I hope I'm not being too obvious. ;-)  Fair starts next week. I'm excited, even though I'm not going to ride the rides because I'll freaking PUKE! Maybe someone will stand with me. Doubt it. Haha.   Things are fine, not much has happened. I'm whipped from getting up so early and doing so much work.   Dear God, PLEASE let this post go through!
