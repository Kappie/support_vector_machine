EVERYTHING. aaahhhh. And for the ppl i dotn really hang out with it btu they know. i dont know how but they do. it suuucks.   i think im just gona fake sick tomoro. ive never done it before. but hopefully itll work. i never want to go bac to that hell hole ever again. it should just fuck a tree. im feeling more depressed everyday. and my family isnt making it any better. they always bitch about everything i do.
