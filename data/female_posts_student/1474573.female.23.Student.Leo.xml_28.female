I'm starting to hate blogger already, or is it that I just dont' have the patience to learn something new? I'm having enough trouble writing and coming to terms with emotions and all of THAT b.s. to further block the unleasing of my SOUL by NOT publishing what i write (uh oh.....i think that was a shappy moment) So tell me? what IS wrong with regular coffee? Is it too strong for you? Too BLACK!! TOO STRONG!! TOO BLACK!!
