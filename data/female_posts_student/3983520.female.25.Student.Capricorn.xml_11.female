Also with all the drama that I am going to I need a way to let it all out. Today has been off to a fairly good start. Things are slow as usually here at work but hey I am still getting paid. I didn't have any childcare issues today either and that is always a plus. I could have did without the phone calls from my children's father but hey I am still learning how to deal with him, putting him in the past and keeping him there. I also got a very positive email from a job that I interviewed with on yesterday. I hope I get it. I really don't know what else to write you better believe that this is one of my more lokey days I am sure there will be drama to come.
