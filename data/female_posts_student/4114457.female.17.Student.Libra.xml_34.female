I hope that one of the women who came through doesn't ever come back... not that it is nice to say that but I don't wanna put up with her again. I am really in the mood to write like I used to... I'm not sure I still have it in me, but I kinda started at work tonight... maybe I can just run with what I came up with... here goes nothing, or everything...       She walked alone through a dark, desolate world while shadows of doubt crept past her. At night, she wandered aimlessly through a twisted parallel universe that existed only within her own mind, contemplating and exaggerating her own problems... During the day, she smiled, laughed, existed as she was expected to, but no one could see beneath her surface. Down below, she was troubled, tormented, unhappy, and confused. She felt she had no where to turn... she didn't. No one understood what she was going through. She knew she wasn't alright, but she wasn't at her end either. Having no reason to be unhappy, she tried not to let it get to her, but something wasn't right. Little things got to her, little things became obsessions, there was no longer a big picture. Late one night while trying to understand herself, she became increasingly drawn to a spider making a web outside the window. For a split second she caught herself thinking about it, spiders, the number two fear in the world, second only to public speaking. She wasn't afraid of public speaking, or spiders, or death... she had a fear that wasn't on any top ten fears list... she was afraid of herself and her thoughts... those deep, dark, unnerving thoughts that could make even the most sane person start thinking irrationally... She left work, went home, and waited. She wasn't sure what she was waiting for; she just knew it was coming. And it was... it was coming before anyone had suspected it would, and finally her paranoia would be answered... it came, and went, taking her down with it, as well as everyone she had ever met, influenced, loved or had been loved by. But after that night it was over. It never again got to her, but no one understood why she did what she did, or how she could. It was late that night, the fog was heavy, the moon was full... the perfect night to walk away from everything, everyone, and not come back.
