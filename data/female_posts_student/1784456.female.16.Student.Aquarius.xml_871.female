That bit's sooo funny! Erm I don't think you can do that thing with Fushigi Yuugi (it's written like that cause of the hat over the u) It apparantly doesn't exactly mean Mysetious Play, it means some thing else... or some weird thing like that. And it might have all that stuff with Yuugi can only be put there and there are loads of meanings for play... you know, crappy french type things. (No offence to French people, it's just our teacher's crap) Mmm... but I don't speak Japanese so I wouldn't know!
