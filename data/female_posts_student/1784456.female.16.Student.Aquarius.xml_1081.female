What a cool death! You'ld be like 'ccooooool' then you'ld see the ground and be like 'ahhh fucccckkkk!' or some thing along those lines! Ehe... greeeat. Oh, I did another dumb thing. People keep calling and not saying any thing, and I was kind of hyper... *i'm always hyper* So I said 'Hello? Hello? Goodbye.' then I cancelled it! WHOOPS! Then I dialed 1471 and before it dialed it this guy said 'hello?' AARGH! Damn I'm a prat!
