His mother replied, "Become Mr. Right."    You can take this opportunity to become a better you or enjoy the aspects of yourself or your life your fiancee could not appreciate. You now have more free time to be with friends and family. You now have more time for hobbies and activities. You can try something new, learn something new, do something new.      Become Ms. Right...Date Yourself....And Be Good to Yourself.
