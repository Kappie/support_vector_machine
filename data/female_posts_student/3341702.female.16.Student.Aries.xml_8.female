I have work tonight at 5:30...which is prolly gonna suck cuz I don't know who's all gonna be bussing besides Cody and me..hopefully Dillon is there...otherwise we're prolly screwed...  But yeah..I'm finally talking to that Jon kid who left me a note last weekend when I was at work. (He'd been following me around practically, and had left the note with my manager that had his AIM sn on it..so I decided I'd talk to him. It's gonna kill him when he finds out I have a boyfriend..^^ *giggle*)And he's actually a pretty cool guy. I'm thinking I could prolly be really good friends with him.  Anywayz...I dunno. I'm still kinda worrying about Jeremie going on his road trip to Ohio...cuz I can tell that Vicky likes him..she wouldn't put him as one of her "interests" if she didn't. And...I dunno. I trust Jeremie, but I don't know if I can trust her or not. Maybe I'm just being paranoid..but he's gonna be gone for  two weeks  and I won't be able to talk to him at  all !! ;.; I'm gonna miss him so much when he goes...  But yeah...I'm gonna try and get my mom's computer...cuz she said she doesn't miss it at all. So I think I'll just have Adam give me the tower and have my sis get the screen and keyboard and mouse and shit..cuz, yeah, I won't be able to go down there anytime soon cuz of work...since they only have me working on weekends. Stupid people.  I dunno..that's all I really have for now..I'm prolly gonna put some more poems up on DA ( my account ^^ )..which will be cool cuz everyone seems to like my poems...o.O I dunno why...but they do.  And that's all the news I have for today...baiobaio! ^^
