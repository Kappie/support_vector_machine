I don't  wanna  go back!  This trip has been too much fun, and too stress-free to think about going back.  I don't deal well with change, and our entire lives are about to change radically.  I'm freakin' scared!  I have NO clue what we are supposed to be doing.  I feel bad that I'm not excited about the new things we're about to encounter.  Isn't this what we've been working towards?  We're almost there!  I should be chomping at the bit, but I'm all ready to head back out to that prairie, where I was chomping on some mighty tasty greens.  Ack!  I can't decide if I feel more anxious about the fact that everything is changing, or about the fact that I'm not excited about it.  Got that?  Am I making any sense here?  Hmm.  Anyway.  Our trip was fantastic.  Susan and I even managed to be in bad moods (mostly) at the same time, thus saving the other person from playing "cheer-up" or "politely ignore."  We both got to do "quiet grump" together.  What a way to bond!  Where'd I leave off?  Oh, yes.  San Francisco.  Love it.  Want to live there someday.  (as well as Greece, Charleston, NYC, DC, Seattle, Montana, London...)  Tuesday, we did some  urlLink shopping , which I swore I wouldn't do.  We also took a ferry out to  urlLink Sausalito , which was beautiful.  So many wonderful art galleries there.  Susan and I decided to come back in ten years, when we may actually be able to pretend to afford a corner of one of the paintings we saw.  I can't imagine spending lots of money on art, but then I see a picture, and it just belongs to me.  Then I feel the need to spend money on it.  Lots and lots of money...  But not yet!  We left SF on Wednesday, to go visit  urlLink Yanna  in San Diego.  That was the shortest leg of our journey - only two nights there, and one full day.  We found the sun again in San Diego - it had deserted us at times in SF.  So.  I don't think most of you realize how candid I am about some things...  But I need to get this off my chest, so forgive me, please.  When travelling, and eating lots of food, and staying at other people's houses, there are certain...  urlLink functions , of the bodily variety, which can prove a bit... difficult to coordinate.  So, we got to Yanna's family's house, and I was overcome.  I just had to go.  And I clogged the freaking toilet.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am the Amazing Toilet Clogger.  I'm in the bathroom, and there is no plunger (I'm flashing back to the scene from "Along Comes Polly," but there was no ferret).  I tried to do what I could - which mostly consisted of me standing there looking confused/annoyed - what a great plumber I'd make!  Then I remembered that Yanna has a large, Russian-Jewish family.  I started thinking: "Oh my gosh.  I probably just broke at least two or three major social etiquette laws (one: pooping in someone's house your first time there; two: clogging the freaking toilet; three: freaking out about it; four: I don't know, I haven't studied the culture!)"  Then I wondered if Yanna's father was part of some ultra-secret, Jewish Russian mafia, and they'd come after me for being so rude and offensive in their home.  [Side bar: of course Yanna's father is not in the Mafia.  At least, I don't think so...]  Anyway, long story shorter, I went and confessed my sin to Yanna, and she said to put the lid down, and later it was just miraculously fixed.  Those mafia must have good plumber connections - wonder if they have a spot for a confused/annoyed looking dame...  San Diego is gorgeous.  And I learned how to SALSA!!!  Well.   Kind of.  I learned how one  should  salsa, and then proceeded to make up my own version of it, which involved lots of tripping and hitting people.  There were lessons at the beginning, in which Susan and I eagerly participated.  When it came time to actually partner up - we were in two long gender-specific lines - all the guys across from us made a beeline straight to the girls on either side of us.  Susan and I were left there towering over all the freshly formed salsa couples.  Quite embarassing.  Kind of like in jr. high, at dances when you're left sitting in a chair by the wall while everyone dances.  Actually.  It was exactly like that...  Thankfully, there were more guys, so they got stuck with us.  I even danced after the lessons - though no guy was brave enough to ask me to dance twice...  :)  Yanna was a star.  I tried to learn from her, but it didn't stick.  I've determined what my main problem is with dancing: I can't do it!  Actually, the problem is that I can't follow a guy's lead.  I am off doing my own thing, which generally involves lots of spinning.  I like spinning...  The bed is calling my name, and there are way too many words here already.  Why are you still reading this??  Don't you have better things to do with your life???  Back to NC tomorrow.  Wish me - and all of us - luck!
