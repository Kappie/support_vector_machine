Lord's Day evening, Pastor Blair from the Galway Mission work in Ireland came and did a presentation on their fellowship there. it was very interesting, as i had not heard much about it before then. after church, Andrew began our Covenanter Tour with an hour long lecture on the 2 reformations in Scotland, plus reformers and what they contributed. Yesterday we went to St. Andrews, a lovely town on the east coast, where we saw a different Covanenter's sites. we did the same today, only we were in Edinburgh. we saw the church where John Knox preached, and where the National Covenant was written and signed. we ate lunch at the Grass Market, a site where many Covenanters were martyred, after singing a few psalms and praying. it has all been very good to see the spots where our history was made, as well as inspiring and challenging to love the Lord and commit my life to Him as much as the Covenanters did, despite the threat of death. Andrew has been repeating over and over again a lot of the facts, which is good because it is hard to soak it in if you only hear it once. well, i'm off to a Church bonfire - according to Karen, anybody who's somebody is going, :-P so we have promised to be there.
