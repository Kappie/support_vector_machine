One of the items they brought back was a painting called 'Mind Cloud' by an artist of the name Brian Doogan. I fell in love with the piece instantly, my mom said it was scary and she 'didn't understand how I could sleep with it in my room' But there was something about it that just drew me to it. I have done MANY searches in the web to find more by this artist, and had found nothing. Today I randomly decided to do a search and found websites everywhere! I was so excited! Some of is pieces I don't quite understand, but others I'm intrigued by. Feel free to let me know what you think...here is a website where you can see more of    urlLink Brian Doogan's    work.
