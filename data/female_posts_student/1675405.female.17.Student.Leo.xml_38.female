There's a lot wrong lately, indeed -- I cannot pin point everything, but  I figure hey it won't hurt to type away. In the best of light, its that much less time I have to bite off everyone else's head.   This weekend has been horrible, well, this week in its entirety has been horrible. After a smashing tete-a-tete with Heather because she ditches me for Jen which lasted until Thursday, I had hoped that my weekend would be a little bit better. Ha! Well, we had a snow day on Friday so I couldn't get my AP History books or notes to cram this weekend.... the test is on Wednesday and I will have no time. Not to mention the fact that I have to play my saxophone solo on Saturday afternoon and it is absolutely dreadful. The volume goes all the way down to ppp for the ending two and a half lines, and Jesus Christ! -- I can't even play that quiet and still sound nice. My reeds are utterly useless; Vandoren Javas are definitely not the thing to be using when I am trying to play a nice classical piece smoothly.   Okay I admit it! I AM stressed out, but I am feeling so low lately. I know that I am mediocre at a lot of things, and I am normally okay with that. But lately I hate to acknowledge the fact that I don't stand out in anything I do. I blend in with the other 6.5 billion people in this world, and to the average bystander I must scream "conformity!"  I hate that! I utterly loathe being around people that are at an extreme in one thing they do: Aaron can play the saxophone beautifully, he is the most talented musician that I  know. Sarah is phenominal with her acting abilities, her talent is so versatile. Marie is practically fluent in Spanish and is working diligently to get her Mentorship program completed for high school credit and to get a head start on her major decision. Heather for God's sakes is so damn skinny and gets all the attention from guys around her.  And then there is me. Just Jennica.   I know I need to stop it... I am going to end up dragging myself so low that I can't pick myself back up. I've done it before, and I know I am completely capable of shredding myself to pieces. I can do it the best- I know what my flaws are, where my weakness lie, and therefore I know which buttons to push.  I don't do it intentionally, mind you. It is human instinct to be insecure with what you've done, what you've accomplished, especially when you see someone else doing it better than you; however, I know I need to rise above that and see myself in the best of light.
