So, last night we opened all the doors and windows.  Well, his window is open, and so I've heard every person that has come or left this apartment building at Sterling... : (  Anyhow, we had a good time last night for the most part.  We went to TCGC (Texas Color Guard Circuit) State Championships.  Anyhow, we got inside JUST in time to catch the tailend of the group performing before Nelson.  They were okay.  Then Nelson's group came on.  They were better than that group (which was Bowie HS).  Nelson's theme was math.  It was interesting to see what he had done with the theme.  Anyhow, after him was Connally HS... this is a group that used to find OUR group at contests just to tell us how 'cool' they thought our shows were.  They always had mediocre shows back then, but have since done a LOT to make themselves better.  Well, their show theme was "Signs," music from the movie.  Oh, man!  That show was incredible...!!! It actually freaked me out a little bit the way the girls were dancing like the aliens moved.  EEP! Anyhow, then we saw some other school (Tomball, I think) do Velocity, which was odd.  They didn't do as good a  job with it as TR did, though!!!  Their costumes were less interesting... and THEY didn't have HUGE green poles!!!  Hehe  The next 'class' was the one TR was in.  We saw Elkins HS, and after their opener we all just sorta looked at each other with VERY worried expressions.  We kinda knew at that point that TR would probably take 2nd.  So, then TR comes on... and it's basically a HUGE embarrassment.  The only up to their performance was that they looked like they were having fun.  Well, so after all the groups performed and we went down closer for the retreat (the awards ceremony) we went and talked to Nelson.  It was good to see him again... and then later after the retreat when we were leaving he almost left his youngest boy Carter!  So, we started back to the car, and as we were walking in front of the building I say outloud... "Man, I have a wedgie..."  At this point, Ricky almost PICKED my wedgie!!!  HAHA  I'm glad he realized what he was about to do voluntarily before he actually DID it... because I would've really freaked out if I would've felt Ricky's fingers pulling out MY wedgie.  HEHE  It's good to know, however, that if I had no hands and couldn't pick my wedgies, all I'd have to do is call Ricky... : D  Well, I think I'll end this post on that note, and I'll post more later on... probably after I go work at the child care "money" office on Monday... :-)  Til next time...
