The actual FOUR HOUR REHEARSAL!!! sucked like no other. stretching for half an hour, basics for an hour, full coordinating for an hour, music for half an hour, and drill for an hour. BLAH! But from then on things improved quite a bit. We did have to sit on buses with our sections but it was ok. Chris and Nathan and I were talking and stuff. So, we did our stuff and went and had an AWESOME show! :) YaY!! And then we got into regular clothes and went and sat in the stands all together. It was soooo cold but I sat between bryan and Chris so...that was better. Plus, I got a sunburn from yesterday during rehearsal so that warmed my face nicely. :)   And so we watched the other bands and such and then....the awards....  We go first!!!!! It was amazing. We got first in our class. that's just so neat considering where we were freshman year. WOW! We got outstanding percussion, and outstanding visual. We didn't get music or guards sadly. :( Oh well, it's ok. I think we got third overall or something like that. Yeah yeah! It rocked. then on the way home, nathan and I switched buses which was really fun because we went to the party bus and we sang all the way home and were just loud and happy although our bus driver was kind of mean....poo on her.   Afterwards, I went to stake N Shake with both Chris', Nathan, and Carrie. Lots and lots of fun. Then we went and dropped Carrie off and just drove around and talked for a while. It was all in all a really fun day, and now I'm really excited for our next competition. I mean...we're actually....GOOD this year. Not like amazing. But we're pretty good considering where we were freshman year! :)   YaY! Everything just seems to be going well right now! I think I'll go grab some lunch before my driving lesson today. Byebye...
