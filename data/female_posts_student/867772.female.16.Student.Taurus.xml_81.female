It's not like I want to feel all depressed.  I'm confused. About a lot.  But I've figure out what might help ease the confusion.  I need to let go of some things. Some things that I can't live with but can't live without. The living-with part is out of my control, but I'm letting myself stop wishing and proceed living-without.  Some dreams aren't chaseworthy.  Will I finally let go this time, or get sucked back into dreaming, like I have a countless number of times?  If the latter of the two occurs, please slap me. Hard.
