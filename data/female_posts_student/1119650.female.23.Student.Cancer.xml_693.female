Well, you see they bought a whole bunch of bagels and spreads and juice and candy and set it all up in the conference room and in order to get in and enjoy it you had to bring in your high school yearbook (or wedding or baby photos if you couldn't find your yearbook) so that everyone could see where we all came from.    Far be it from me to pass up a) free food and b) an opportunity to not work so I took one for the team and brought my book in.  I took a lot of flack because I'm the youngest person here aside from the summer interns.  I brought in my yearbook from my Junior year of high school and got lots of "Oh please, you still look the same" or "That doesn't even count...My pets are older than you" kind of comments but all in all it was a pretty fun experience.  Working for a municipal government we have a lot of "Townies" here, so we got yearbooks from my high school that spanned the decades and it was funniest looking through the faculty section and seeing what teachers were still there and how they looked way back when.    It also got me thinking about how much I absolutely  loathe  many of the people I considered "friends" in high school.  There are some whom I genuinely enjoyed (and in some cases still continue to enjoy) their company, but for the most part as I read over all the "we'll always be friends and hang out everyday this summer" messages I cringe a little bit.  I'm fortunate for having a falling out with my high school friends halfway through my first semester at college though I thought it would absolutely be the death of me at the time.  (Can we tell I was a drama queen even from the beginning, LOL)  It allowed me to meet a lot of really great people whom I never would have met otherwise (many of them are even linked to this blog!) and I got to do a lot of things that I enjoyed that weren't quite within the confines of an "ideal", or should I say "stereotypical", act from a twenty-something in my Town.  For this: I'm thankful.  To my real friends: thank you for being by my side and being in my life, you mean more to me than I'll ever let on.    To my faux friends: I appreciate your brief appearance in my life and I hope that I learned something from you.  Thanks for pushing me in a direction I might not have gone without you.
