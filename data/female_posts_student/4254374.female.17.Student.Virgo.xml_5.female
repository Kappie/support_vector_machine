It’s a pity people from Hong Kong  Taiwan don’t regard themselves as people from China. He was really friendly, mingling with so many people there. I’d like to be more amiable, but it’s embarrassing when one forgets names. I forgot Ivanka’s name last Friday, minutes after she told me. I’m pretty satisfied with the amount of work I achieved today. I did about 6 hours' of work (yay!) , though I feel that without that $20  Psychology experiment I participated in, I could’ve accomplished more. I just feel that, if I don’t earn my own pocket money, it’d put a strain on my parents’ income overtime. My home stay rent, transport fares  tuition fees are costly enough.            A smile  a friendly conversation can brighten a dull day.
