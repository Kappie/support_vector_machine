LOL, i love being with heather and andrea, because they're crazy... but i do miss my kris fix (ie:kristin, if you read this, get it... because i'm on heroin, eh? eh?. so yea, we have a lot of fun ant andrea's and we were vair, vair nuts indeed. they are getting bikini waxes or brazilian... jealousy. and then heather and i went and got frozen yoghurt, watched hot chick. and she slept over. whew! i got 65%  exactly  on my report card for geography. my average was 71... haha. i got 55 in math and he recommended me for applied next year, bastard. then i went from an 87 to an 80 in english. probably because i FUCKING hate (well intensely dislike) ms. s. and.. 85 in gym, good, i mean because i broke my arm and because i was out sick for 3 weeks. so, yes, i called lesley because her comment sounded kinda desparate. and shannon commented... and shannon, i'll prolly be having my party at the very end of august. okay? it might be a couple days before school... so hopefully you're allowed to stay over.  um, roight. so today, i woke up at 1, when andrea called me, apparently she'd been calling all morning, oops. and (heather went home earlier) my mom took me to andrea's house (not before she left me at pharma plus... my mom is a crazy nut ball). then lesley, heather, andrea and i went to play tennis. it was awesome. we saw mike and conner on the way. then we went back and swam. we tried playing this underwater game where we talk. but no one got it really. i mean, "homosexual" was difficult as was "sex" and "boobs" and "stick that in your cunt and smoke it". lol. then i went home amd am sitting on my bum. tomorrow; i'm playing tennis with andrea (i think) and then lesley and heather are watching me playing my soccer game. then i sleep over at lesley's and play lots of lovely pool, which i suck at. so this is really long. i'm guessing. only 5 more days for kristin to come back!!!!! luc wants to do something the 11th, the night she gets back. but he's an ass, and banned from my house unless he wants an ass-kicking. so unless he does something impressing. too bad. love, ~bekah~  oh yes.. by the way  sexes, is someone/somthing that makes you horny and bothered. sex.. is yes.. well... you know, the dirty deed.  there eric, i hope it was good! i tried to entertain you.
