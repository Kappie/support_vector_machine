It's like I can't do anything or say anything without the whole world finding out. And then the stories get twisted or even made up and...oh my gosh, it's making me go insane. I having nothing that's my own anymore! It's like my own thoughts belong to the world...and they aren't even my own. Then again, look at me...I'm sitting here publishing my thoughts for the world to read anyway. But I don't sell my life away to the public...so why doesn't everyone mind their own business, and I'll keep more introverted? How's that? Sounds like a plan. It's my life, and from now on I'm running it my way, and I'm keeping it less open-book. I totally admire those people who keep parts of their lives so secluded...I wish I could do that.
