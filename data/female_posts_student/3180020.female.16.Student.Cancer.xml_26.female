Jana called and she got me a little felt thingy that you color b/c i said I liked the one she had in her room!! aww..she's so sweet! anyway she called and wanted me to come and eat with her and cretia...they FORCED me to go to Captain D's b/c they thought *dude* was working and they wanted me to see him! and i wanted to too, but oh well! there's always tomorrow...anyway, before jana called i had company but he left when i left...then i got home at like 5 and i asked momma if chris could come over b/c i really really really needed to see his lil ass before i left...she said "sure" and i about crapped..him and jermiah came over at like 6:30 and waited for jess to call and say that jermiah could come over, but that didn't really happen....so they went back home b/c his parents didn't know he was here..anyway...then i had some more company and then chris and jermiah came back..and then my other company left at like 10 and so did jermiah to go to jess's...and then me and chris hung out and it was TOTALLY GOOD! I've really really really missed being with him...I mean we were never together but its there and I know it, even if he doesn't! *I love you* anyway...enough on that before mack hurls....oh well...i really dont care...you know...i have to be happy some way or another and i was tonight and i cant help it that he makes me happy ya know!

I love you jess....I hope you have fun on your trip, I wish I could have spent my last few days at home with you but its my time to get out of this place..and i've said it a thousand time, but I have to say it to be ok with it....I needa get away to make sure I can stand on my own 2 feet! I love you to death and I rely on you and everyone else too much...Even the people that I dont really care about, the little things make me happy...thats how **I** can be having the worst day ever and still laugh and smile and everything...b/c if you and mack and everyone are ok, then so am i...i just needa be on my own and do things for myself ya know...im scared, and sad to go..but its for the good!
