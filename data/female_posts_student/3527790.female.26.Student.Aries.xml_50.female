I know that he does not love me and that he has a girlfriend...But I am really enjoying being his friend and having him consider me as a friend. Maybe I am weird because of this, but that is how I feel. Don't get me wrong I still have feelings for him and some days are really tough on me, but every once in a while we have a GREAT day as friends and that makes all the bad days almost worth it all. Weekends are the worst because I know that he is with her, but that too is slowly getting better.  I don't know maybe ex's can be friends if the situation requires it and the two parties truly want a friendship. Most of my friends think I am crazy because of the way that he treated me for even giving him the time of day and maybe that would be the better way. I don't know except that he and I have a lot of fun together and can totally relax around each other.  I have Lisa (a friend of mine) believes in reincarnation and she thinks that everyone has a past life and sometimes you run into people in their new bodies but they are the same soul. Sometimes that means you get a second chance at something you screwed up or were kept from in a previous life. I don't know that I believe in reincarnation, but maybe there is something to that.  Maybe my soul and his soul are old buddies and that is why we are so drawn to each other. I don't know how to explain it, but we are the idiot boy and I are drawn to each other. Being apart not so much geographically but definitely emotionally is extremely difficult on us.  Who knows where any of this will lead. Not me! I just keep going one day at a time thankful for the happy moments that help me get through the tough moments.
