I couldn't believe Gadafi was so depressed. He was the coolest guy I knew. G-man, they called to him as he breezed past the entrances of some of the most happening clubs in town. Girls flocked to him like bees to honey. And man, has he had some fine pieces over the years. But he was always the one to leave. Always the one who kept them coming back and crying for more.  And this was the guy who was quietly sobbing on the other end of the phone.  "Man, Far, you don't know this chick. She's different from the others. She ain't some two-bit cheap ass you can find on the dancefloor. She's got class and beauty. Oh God! And her smell would drive me insane everytime she passed by. Damn man! I don't know what to do! I got to have her back! I need her man! I need her!"  I could hear him hitting his head on the wall as he sobbed.  "Stop it man! Get a grip! It's just some bitch! Plenty more like her out there. What you on about? If she turned you down, she must be a dumb bitch too! And dumb bitches are the worst!"  And perhaps the tears became a bit too much for him, or maybe the words were too harsh. But I found myself listening to beeping of a dead line. Grimly, I replaced the phone.  "Stupid Bitch!"
