It’s been over a month since I updated it, and due to the multiple requests to update it again, I’ve decided it’s about time.  Or maybe I’m just fed up with everybody telling me to write in it…  So anyways, there’s no way I can recap on everything I’ve done since my last update, sooooo.. I’ll just make a generalized statement that life is still rather boring and the majority of what I do is hang out at Collin’s house (which is actually a lot of fun).  Christmas was super fantabulous- I got tons of clothes, a few DVD’s, aaaaand a bunch of other stuff that I don’t feel like typing out right now.  The grandparents were here, so that was fun.  I don’t get to see them much, and although I complained a lot about having to hang out with them, I really did have a good time.  And they spoil my sister and me VERY much.  Oh oh!!! Mooney wrote a nice poem/rap about me and it’s in his profile, but it won’t be there forever, so I’ll put it in here so that you’ll always be able to read it!!!  (or maybe I’m just trying to make this blog entry super long to make up for that lost time…)  From within the fury Of the endless fog, There shines the eyes Of mighty M Dawg. She travels far With a triumphant smile, She wins the battle And makes the 8-mile. :: break into rap song:: Melissa Nieves (M Dawg):    What up, G Funk, please take a seat,    You're gonna need to be sittin' when I break out my beat,     I'm bling, I'm sexy, I can cook really well,     I bag Catholic tricks, so you're ALL GOIN' TO HELL!     (Back Up Singers:  Yeah, we're all goin' to helllllll.)     I rap like I shop: owning all in my presence,     Makin' all of my money and boggling all with my essence,     Sponge Bob is my homie, his mad skillz will spin ya,     Bow down to teh M Dawg, the all-mighty Ninja.  How cool is that?!?!?  Thanks Mooney!  You r0x0r : )  Anyhoo, gonna hang out with friends today- we have a whole list of things to do so we shouldn’t be bored!! Yay!!   I’m going to end this blog entry now, but as Matt Fuglie said, I should make several of them, so don’t worry- I’ll keep more coming, Until next time!
