Maybe that means having your testicles pierced, maybe it means being beaten with pointy sticks, maybe they leave you somewhere to die and you find your way out alive. In the Wookie culture, the young ones must retrieve something from the inside of a man eating plant.  With all these cases though, there’s a clear cut passage. If you can handle it, everyone agrees you’re a man.  There is no such thing in America, and what we do have varies. In some groups your manhood may mean getting really drunk. In highschool it meant “hitting” some sweet “airs” on a motorcycle. Most popular of course, is “banging” as many “chicks” as fate would allow you to.   ...  So as a ponder my own manhood, I realize my accomplishments place me, culturally of course, more in league with women. I don’t mean to brag, but I’m a good listener. When I need to, I have a good sense of color coordination. I have an acute social awareness, when I choose to use it. Those things don’t seem to count though. They don’t make me a “man”.  I’m going backpacking this weekend. Hiking is one of the few times where I feel my manhood in its true element, where I just know. There’s several important things to know about hiking. You have to be prepared.  First of all, if you don’t have a knife, you’re asking for death on a silver platter. That’s why I always bring a backup knife for each of my primary knives. I keep one on my leg, one on my belt, one on my shoulder, one on the back of my pack, and then one large one inside my pack- just in case I’m disarmed.   Scenario : A vampiric beaver is at the leg of a fellow hiker, tearing at his flesh with its soul sucking incisors.   Solution : Use one knife to pin his beaver tail to a tree, one to trim his sharp beaver nails, and 2 knives to pry open the jaws of death. Then use your largest knife to amputate the victim’s leg, because its probably going to get the brown death (beaver disease). You can’t apply first aid without a knife, so get out your sterilized medical knife to cut the gauze stripes at the right length.    There are several other important uses for knives, which no other tool can claim. Firstly, knives are capable of making any object pointy, and therefor a weapon. It only takes one knife to build a hunting arsenal.    Example : in “the Edge”, the two characters kill the bear with a large pointy stick.   Secondly, I cannot understate the usefulness of chap stick. Aside from offering your lips comfort, it can be used as a greaser, or to make small objects waterproof.    Scenario : An angry tree has fallen on a comrade.    Solution : Use the chap stick on the contact area to decrease surface friction. Wedge and prop the chap stick up vertically under the log to give the victim enough space to grease himself out from under the falling jaws of death.  In any of these dangerous situations, when you can smell the jaws of death closing in around you, the greatest tool you have is your ability to manipulate the environment. I speak of being resourceful.   Scenario : You are thirsty.   Solution : Drink water.  Somehow, when I’m out there with all my stuff, it’s like I’ve become the G.I. Joe I always wanted to be as a child. There is a peace in knowing I can survive in the wild as I construct my fragile illusions of masculinity. An illusion which is shattered upon my return to society.
