Dammit, I turn 24 today... I AM OLD! But it's been good so far, I went to lunch with my mom yesterday and we went to Tiffanys to get my birthday present, this morning I received a pleasant surprise from my friend Joann at work who gave me a beautiful silver electric lighter (no more worrying about wind!) and tonight Leigh and I tag along with Reggie to the Wizards Game. Yay!
