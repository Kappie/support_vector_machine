I went to go see Farenheit 9/11. it was surprisingly good. i'm glad i went, its just that i really dont know what to believe about either side. Nevertheless it had some very good points. i just think that Micheal Moore being him, could've done better. And i want to go see cold mountain too, we just rented it. I love that movie. and the book is even better, as always. Im sorry about last night alanah, i hope i didnt make you think anything of it. As i just said before i have this horrible way of creating horrible things in my head, and making myself flip out over something that is actually ok. so ignore me.  you want to do something again before you leave? if you're not doing anything with amanda or anyone else give me a call and we can go exercise or anything really. love you!! and if i dont see you before you leave, have a MAUVELOUS time. i know you will. there aren't ugly mexicans down there. yuck!...i was at Katy Mills today...sigh. i'm going to go watch my movie now. boi.
