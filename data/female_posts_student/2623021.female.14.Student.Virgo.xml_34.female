I cried during Laurel's speach, I couldn't believe how sad it was. Felicia and I were close to tears the whole time. I cried afterwards, someone I like so much came up and gave me a hug and as soon as we walked away I started crying! Today I cried too. Jennifer and I were talking about how pretty soon we were going to be up there getting our diploma's and being done with high school, and how we will never have the same group of people in this school ever again. My friends are the world to me right now. I don't know what I would do without them. It's even worth the stupid gossip that goes around our school. I don't care anymore, I have realized that people will say what they want to say and I shouldn't care about it because even if it's not true it's going to be said eitherways. We were trying to have a bonfire today although I didn't even try to go... I'll just have to call them and tell them that I won't be out there, they can go if they want to.  I think I want to go to ASU. I love Arizona... but I also love Maine... I don't know where I am going to go, but I can garentee that it will be one of those two places. I am not even going to think about it until I am a junior, I mean hell, I have 3 years to worry about this. I am going to stop stressing the small stuff! :) CARPE DIEM! Sieze the day... for tomorrow we die! Ciao
