All occured in the Hamptons so I'm guessing that had something to do with it cause I hardly ever dream this silly. So yeah, dream number one, my dad becomes president and some way shape or form, Prince Harry, Williams younger brother, tells a tabloid he has a crush on me and wants to "pull" with me ("pull" is the British term for hook up, learned it last summer). So, he invites me to London to spend time with him and Mickey is all worried I'm gonna leave him for a prince, and I mean, who can blame him, and I don't remember if I do or not... well, if I did, I mean.. come on.. he's a prince. Dream number two was my dad telling me he got me a condo that was attacted to a Barns and Noble and when I asked him why I needed one he told me I could use it for college and I said "But dad, I'm going away to college what do I need a condo for?" and he told me "You can take it with you." I'm still trying to figure this one out.  So, I'm awiating part two of both dreams... maybe Harry will come live with me in my portable condo.  Took the Math B Regent today and, let me just say... at least we will all be in summer school together.  Chem is tomorrow so... least it's my last one. I'm gonna go to the mall after the exam probably so I can get some running shorts and stuff for ND. I can't beleive it's next week.  So, yeah.. what's been up with everyone lately? All those lucky bastards who don't have exams this week... tomorrow it'll be ALL over and that's a good thing. Florida is coming up pretty quick too... AH! I can't wait to see those guys. I hope Derrick can make it like he says he can. Me and Elliot are gonna have a blast, he's stayin in my room for a bit, and the Canadians are always a blast to hang out with.. I have fun talkin to those guys online on WebCam, it'll be great to be able to like see them see them. AH!! Less the 2 months!  I had a bold and daring moment today... enough said. x0x
