Tomorrow: I need rides to whatever we are doing, sorry, nothing new, though. Heheh, but yes, let's do something!! Although planning may not be that effective seeing as though tomorrow's weather isn't trusty. But we can think of options!! Because you all know how much I love options. Oh yea, baby!!  In case you are wondering, which you probably weren't but I figured I would tell you anyway, I am ecstatic at this very moment! My mom and I just went driving, and I did all well and everything. It was exciting! I dropped Maggie's pants off, went to Starbucks, etc.  I was going to drop everyone else's clothing off, namely Jessie's numerous garments I happen to have in my posession, but unfortunately... my cat decided to dump over the bag onto the floor of which had dog hair on it. Now I wouldn't consider that clean, would you?  Woooo I love you ALL!!
