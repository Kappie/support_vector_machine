( See post from March 5th )  Last Friday was the last time that I really yelled at him. ...He was sitting in during our last rehearsal for  Actor's Nightmare  and he was, as usual, being an ass. ...But later that night, while I was waiting to audition of  To Kill A Mockingbird , he came up to me and somewhat apologized and told me he'd try not to piss me off if I would be nicer to him... So for the past week I have been very polite towards him.  ...But today... oh man... After seventh period, as I am getting ready for rehearsal at the back of the auditorium, he is sitting in the middle of it with Elise (who does the most awesome artwork... I want to marry some of her paintings.. not really...). He turns around and tells me that he had a dream about me last night; in the dream he was a Hardy boy and I was the Nurse (referring to the scene that I am directing with him in it). And he told me that it was very nice... in a tone that implied more than that the scene went well... (....Are you following what I am saying here?...) ...I just told him to stop right there. Then he walked out of the auditorium, and I said to CJ (lighting guy), who was standing beside me and chuckling at what Corbin had said, that I hated Corbin and he just chuckled some more...  ....A few minutes later, I was walking back to the soundboard after going to G's room, I heard Corbin talking, but I figured he was talking to Elise so I didn't pay attention what he was saying.... But I decided to look up anyway... And he was talking to me.. Almost immediately after I realized that he was talking to me, he finished what he was saying... All I caught of what he said was him almost begging me to be his girlfriend... "...I'll never cheat on you! I'm always nice to you! Come on!..."  ...Pathetic, huh?...  After rehearsal, everyone was helping clean up for tomorrow (Regional Thespian Competition). I had already finished my assigned task (sweeping the main hallway) and Corey asked me to wash the windows at the main entrance--the same area where Corbin was hanging out... I don't feel like going through everything he said and did. But one thing really got to me.... I went outside to wash the outside of the windows, and after I did Corbin was proclaiming that he had been hitting on me and--get this--that he had gotten to first base (kissing, right?) with me and (according to Michael) that by tonight he was going to get to home base with me... Needless to say, that really, really pissed me off...   Bah...   Oh, I'm Dillon's subsitute girlfriend now for whenever Caitlyn (sp.?) isn't in eyesight... Haha, yeah don't ask...  Oh... Michael said that Claire and I were cute.. tehe...   OH OH OH! ...If you're not doing anything tomorrow at 1, come see  Wings . I swear, it's gonna rock... ...Throughout the whole play, Pink Floyd's  Umma Gumma  plays... How could it not be good?...
