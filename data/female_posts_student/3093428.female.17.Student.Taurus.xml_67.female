Oh well, got a noon game today. Hope I do well.  Notice how my life is full of hope? I find that cool!  So after I got home from work I went to my room and worked on some trains before I went to bed. I really wanted to enjoy some awesome worship at youth, but I was at work, so it wasn't happening. So everyone was in bed and the lights turned off, I decided to listen to my Hillsong CD. It was like worship, my headphones blocked any other noise and you could hear the crowd in the background. It was actually awesome! I worshiped Jesus by myself in my room with just a CD. I really enjoyed it and it made me reflect on past good times.  Anywho, some closing comments. Yes Marey Kate is addicted to cocaine and she's in some rehab centre. And now with this post, I believe that 50% of the last 10 posts have been mine. UH OH STEPHANIE! hahaha! Good times, I wonder why are other members don't post?
