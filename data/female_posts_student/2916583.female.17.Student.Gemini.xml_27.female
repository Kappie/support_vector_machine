For all the pranks people have gotten me with, I deserve to get a few people.  Probably the two best: (1) This one actually happened yesterday, so I was off guard.  We had to write a paper defending or arguing against a ban on dihydrogen monoxide.  So I wrote a three page paper on why we should ban dihydrogen monoxide.  I said it damages the environment, contributes to childhood obesity, and endangers our futures.  For all the non-chemistry majors out there (which is pretty much all of you), dihydrogen monoxide is nothing but...water!  I felt like such an idiot. (2) At lunch, there was a cool looking stapler on the table.  Jherrica told me that it stapled colored staples.  So I decided to staple the air in order to see for myself.  It was a shocking stapler, and it hurt!  Later, she got a bunch of people and we were laughing like crazy.  I think Alex B.'s reaction was funniest.  She started screaming, and almost everyone at our table screamed too, and Brittany B. has a really high-pitched scream, so we almost choked from laughing.  Yeah, people were staring.  That makes twice I've gotten an electrical shock, but it didn't hurt the first time.  I pity people who die from electrocution (except people who do by electric chair...I'm a firm believer in the death penalty).   I'm reading an awesome book called the  Da Vinci Code .  I don't care what Shaheen says, it's an awesome book.  I think it's the one think that I have in common with Katie J.  I was shocked to find out two things: 1). Da Vinci was homosexual, and 2). Noah was an albino.  I also found something that might interest Harry Potter fans.  The professor of astronomy is Professor Sinistra...Sinistra can mean either left or evil.  Hmm... I invented a great snack for afternoons too, and it's easy even for hopelessly hopeless cooks.  Just preheat the oven to 350 degrees, then sprinkle shredded or thinly sliced cheddar cheese (mozzarella, Monterey jack, and sharp cheeses could also work) onto Texas Toast.  After the preheat is done, set the timer to ten minutes, and place the toast with cheese in the oven.  Take it out after the ten minutes are up, and enjoy! My finding streak has not ceased.  I lost and found my graphing calculator, and I found some of my favorite cosmetics - some great mascara, my second favorite blush that gives just a hint of a flush, and some lip glosses.  Hope I can find where I put my common sense.  I said some stuff in B.'s class that weren't very flattering of the possibility of me having common sense.  B: Would you want your significant other to say that your love is like a vegetable garden?  Me: It would be a healthy relationship...(to understand this one, you have to know that we were talking about deserts) B: So where's the love?  Me: In the desert?  The last one is too embarrassing.   Well I g2g.  Later.  (Quizilla's down so no quiz results)
