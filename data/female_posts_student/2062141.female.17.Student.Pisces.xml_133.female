And the end of the world"  There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now- It's more like cold blue ice in her heart  Ever gets those moments of inexplicable desire to write, and to actually say something? I have the desire but not the energy... or anything of import to say. Just.. when I listen to music and hear the beautiful things they say, it just makes me want to write. And I love to write. But for some reason I'm not inspired... and I feel that to write something that really has substance I need to feel conflicted... and there's no conflictions in my life right now. Meh. Fuck it.
