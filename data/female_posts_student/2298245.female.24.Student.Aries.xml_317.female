Then, I was pretty sure that I read somewhere it referred to fact that in Catholic doctrine Mary was born without the stain of original sin.  But bringing this up with some Catholic friends at school led to some confusion.  So today, long after the initial discussions, I decided to put off work and go on a little quest for the information.  A quick Google search led to the  urlLink following information discovery :   It’s important to understand what the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is and what it is not. Some people think the term refers to Christ’s conception in Mary’s womb without the intervention of a human father; but that is the Virgin Birth. Others think the Immaculate Conception means Mary was conceived "by the power of the Holy Spirit," in the way Jesus was, but that, too, is incorrect. The Immaculate Conception means that Mary, whose conception was brought about the normal way, was conceived without original sin or its stain—that’s what "immaculate" means: without stain. The essence of original sin consists in the deprivation of sanctifying grace, and its stain is a corrupt nature. Mary was preserved from these defects by God’s grace; from the first instant of her existence she was in the state of sanctifying grace and was free from the corrupt nature original sin brings.   So this solves the mystery.  And it is nice to know that I was not going insane, that I did not imagine I read something that I did not.  This got me thinking about other things that Catholics believe, more specifically the doctrine of It’s important to understand what the  urlLink doctrine of transubstantiation :   Transubstantiation means more than the Real Presence. According to transubstantiation, the bread and wine are actually transformed into the actual body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ, with only the appearances of bread and wine remaining. This is why, at the Last Supper, Jesus held what appeared to be bread and wine, yet said: "This is my body. . . . This is my blood" (Mark 14:22-24, cf. Luke 22:14-20). If Christ were merely present along side bread and wine, he would have said "This contains my body. . . . This contains my blood," which he did not say.   This has been explained to me many times by my good friend Christina, who is not Roman Catholic but is more wise about these matters than myself (really, she's more wise about everything, but I don't like to dwell on that), and I can never quite remember exactly how it goes, so for good measure I looked it up as well.  So thanks for taking this trip with me down the road of Catholic dogma.  It's been fun.  Assuming you kept reading this far, that is.   UPDATE :  Since the original source of my consernation was a correction I read in the New York Times, this evening my curiousity got the better of me and I went to look it up.  I found the  urlLink original correction I had read :   A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend yesterday about religious films that have stirred contention included an erroneous reference to the Immaculate Conception in connection with Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film ''Hail Mary.'' Christian doctrine teaches that Mary was conceived by her mother, Anne, without the stain of original sin; the term does not refer to the conception of Jesus by Mary.    But then I found this, a  urlLink correction to the correction :   A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend on Friday about religious films that have stirred contention included an erroneous reference to the Immaculate Conception in connection with Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film ''Hail Mary,'' and a correction in this space on Saturday misattributed the belief involved. It is Roman Catholic teaching -- not the teaching of all Christian denominations -- that Mary was conceived by her mother, Anne, without the stain of original sin. And the term does not refer to the conception of Jesus by Mary.   I found this to be amusing.  Not surprising.  But very amusing.  So I thought I'd add it on the the fun.
