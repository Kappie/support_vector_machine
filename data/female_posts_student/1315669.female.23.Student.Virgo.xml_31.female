My bf must be busy with his work that he din reply me. Sighz. Poor Babez. He's got suba diving lessons later after work too. Must be really tired. Haven seen him since Sunday. Miss him loads though. Oh well, sometimes a man got to do what a man's gotta do yea? =]  Going out with my gfs later. Haven been clubbing with my school gers in a large group for eons! Really looking forward to it. Hmm..maybe my baby's angry at me for going clubbing later? Hiakz. I went last week too.. But then again, I really got nothing to do at home.. =/ Baby, if u reading this, hope u understand yea? I dun tink I can club anymore when I started working 6 days a week next time. Sighz.   Just login and check my results from the NUS website. Shesh. I call it a head baging experience cos my caps was a mere 0.08 pt deficit to getting an hounors! ARGGHHH!!! SObs. I can't believe I did so shittily for my Pharm Practise. It was really an atrocious shock to me. Wat the freak. Sighz... Oh well, what's done is done isn't it? At least I did my freaking best for this. And I'm graduating but I can't help but feel the stupid tug in my heart.   Sighz.
