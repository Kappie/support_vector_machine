I think it is right as it is...I think anyways. The coordinator of the Flying WILD program wants to change it to "Who was that Masked Bird?" and it's really bothering me for some reason...I think "was" should be capitalized because it acts as a verb and "that" should be capitalized because I think it's the adjective. But I am very fuzzy on my grammar skills, so my disagreement can only go so far. Oh, well, I'm still bothered by the whole thing though...
