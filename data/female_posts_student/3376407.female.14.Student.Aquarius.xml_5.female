But I guess I am glad that everybody got moved to morning service, cause most of my group doesn't go to our church, so it would have been just Margaret, Me, my Dad and maybe Laura, but she shared last week, so I don't think so. But that would have been really bad, cause then we'd all have to speak for a really long time. :( But Mr. Filson and my dad edited ECHO trip #1's video, and now it is extremely boring. They took out all the good and funny parts, including all of us jumping in the pond. :) So tomarrow you all get to see ECHO at its boreingest!
