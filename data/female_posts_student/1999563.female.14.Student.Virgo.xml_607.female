So today I thought I would just blog and use the computer but instead I found myself reading for hours and hours. And, if that wasn't enough, I cleaned the house because I knew my mom would be to tired to do it when she gets home.  I am starting to wierd myself out, but it rocks.  I can't watch TV anymore either. They told us to question everything we watched. They also told us how twisted the news was so I hate to watch that also.  I am a wreck!!! :)  Instead of reading the MSN Celebirty Gossip I am reading Shakespeare!    I am quite excited. I wish I could go to Worldview everyday. I love it so much.  It was like they open the fire hose of knowledge and I tried to drink it up as fast as I possibly could. It was hard at times to try to even get a little drink out of the rushing flood, but even to recieve little tablespoon was well worth the try.  As it turns out I wont get to go to the mall afterall. But I am not sad.   After Worldview I don't even like to shop!!  Right after camp ended my mom took me on a shopping trip in downtown Seattle. Just 7 days before I would have emptied my pockets at the sight of any item realtivley cool.  I tried on endless gorgeous clothes. But for some reason, I just felt like I needed nothing.  I may not have many clothes but I have more than enough. [does that even make sense?]  I used to be totally focused on my appearance. I used to even try to justify my "need" to look good with Bible verses.  But it was all a lie.  recently I was reading my Bible and I cam eupon this verse:  Psalm 45:11  The king is enthralled by your beauty;  honor him, for he is your Lord.   Isn't that wonderful?!  I may not be the most attractive girl. I may not have guys bowing at my feet. But, the KING OF THE WORLD is ENTHRALLED by MY beauty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I also found another verse..  1 Timothy 2:9-10 I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.    That is so right. It seems like I always get caught up with having expensive clothes that I ignore God. If I say I am a Christian, does that mean I have to look plain? Absolutely not. I am still struglling with this but it seems like God would want me to have confidence..and if I was wearing a patato sack it doesn't seem like I would have any confidence...   Hmm.  Something to ponder, eh?
