I think it would be kind of creapy if somthing went wrong with the Verichip but it is still inside of me.   2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this? I think that the society would be able to adapt to this kind of technology pretty quickly since it has adapted to technology which more advance than a Verichip.   3. What would be the benefits of this technology? They then wouldnt need to waste money by hiring anyone for costomer service, or for check out since evrything could be done by technology.   4. What could become problems with this technology? Somthing might go wrong with the Verichip and might casuse somekind of disease. People could just cut off your arm for the chip and go to stores and buy all the stuffs they want to buy with your chip.   5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology. I think that it would be pretty useful for the people who would actually want to use them.
