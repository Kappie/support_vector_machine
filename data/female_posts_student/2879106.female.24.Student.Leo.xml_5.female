But I am back and ready to tell you everything that has been going on in my life. I think last time I wrote me and Alek were having problems. Well things are going great in that area now. We have worked everything out and we are back better than ever. Everything is going well in other aspects of my life. Friends are great!!! School is okay!!! It's getting harder the closer I get to the end of the year but I am sure I will get through it. Lastly, Work!!!! I hate that damn place and I wish I wouldn't ever have to go back. BUT YOU KNOW BILLS BILLS BILLS!!!!! I have to work and I guess I just need to stop complaining about it. That's all for now I will write more later. LOVE YA!!
