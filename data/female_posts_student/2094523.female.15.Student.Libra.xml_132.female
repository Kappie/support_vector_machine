When you dont give a shit bout anything u hurt less, ure happier, and ure free. As for the rest of us jackasses who care way too much about everyone and everything i guess thats just the way its gonna be no matter how much we hate it. Yah it kinda sucks. I wish i didnt have the gene that made me care..but apparently i do
