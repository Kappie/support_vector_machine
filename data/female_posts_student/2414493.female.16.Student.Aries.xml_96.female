So I'm just sitting here watching the clock and deciding when I should get off my ass and the typical lazy Friday that comes with it to go play the piano. Obligations. I know I'm not going to make it to the state level even if I got mad at Mom for telling me that, but I still want to be able to get through this without doing the little doubtful pauses that just snowball into one big "shit, this is a bad idea" epiphany.  But I want to sleep too. I was up at 1:30 this morning making lemon bars and doing Bailey. Oh, how I hate that phrase. Doing Bailey. Doing Bailey. And now that I'm talking to E and C and S, I just feel like it's crazy to leave...all three of them, and at once?  For some reason, I feel cold (literally) and detached. It's the feeling of itching to write no matter where you are, the feeling of putting on that stoic face. I don't know. There are some good days and you know they're good when your face glows and you're just jumping all over the place, and then there are those other days when you know it's mediocre at best even when you look in the mirror.  I'm tired.
