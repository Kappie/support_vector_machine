When Bush was elected, I wasn't sure if the world would still continue to spin. My eight-year-old self was a bit concerned about this change in continuity. But my 23-year-old self is somewhat perplexed at feeling sad. After learning so much about his atrocious policies in the world, I'm still a bit nostalgic for my youthful feeling that he could do no wrong, because he was the president of the United States. I think at that point I wasn't even sure about political parties, but I knew who the President was. He was the only political figure I knew by name, and it's kinda sad that he's dead. The end of an era.
