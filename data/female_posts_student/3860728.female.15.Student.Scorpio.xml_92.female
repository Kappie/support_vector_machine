I masturbated just a few minutes ago. I signed up for this thing which sends me free pictures of gay guys having sex every day. OH YEAH. I looked up Jennifer's number on dogpile.com and so i called her and we talked for like.. FOREVER. I was so happy to talk to her again. She said she just got back from taiwan and was telling me about how the wheather was nice there for the first time and how her relatives live in taipig (or whatever the fuck the capital is). We did a lot of politic discussing and she was happy to hear the news about the bush administration considering the new voting laws. We might go see farenheit 9/11 next weekend after her parents get paid. She also said her and her brother are going to start taking Tennis lessons soon. I also talked to Q and Keisha today. Keshia is going to have to retake Algebra 101 next year (HAAAAAA) and Q said the usual perveted shit. I still haven't gotten my fucking schedule either. God i still have to get started on that AP shit. I have yet to hear from my beloved Ashley.. i don't know what is up with him, but if he doesn't call tonight im going to buy a calling card and call his skinny ass tomorrow/todayish. Everyone is already asleep as usual. Even missy, she's lying right behind my ass.. im thinking about blowing spit in her face so she wakes up. Maybe i will.. maybe i won't... i will. Lmao, she turned jumped up and ran under lavender's bed. Lavender is sleeping in the guest room tonight since she apparently can't stand me. Hmmm... i finally had a HOME COOKED meal. It was fucking awsome... no french fries or anything. I'll probably post back again soon... iunno.
