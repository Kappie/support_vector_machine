We decide to dye my hair and then decide to dye hers but we ran out of red hair dye so we had to get more and we went to the story with half her head dyed and the other half normal so we put a wet towel around her head and put a bunny hug on her to cover it but it didn't do so well LOL everyone looked at her like she was stupid or something LOL it was so funny! Then we came back and finished her hair put red streaks in my sisters hair and then we hung out.  Seduced Richard over MSN LOL that was fun!(it was mostly Michelle!) AHAHAHA LMAO! Michelle you don't disgust me you make me laugh! I can't wait to hear stories after the summer! After Michelle and I were on MSN my dad said to get decent clothes on because we were going to Red Lobster.  So Michelle called home and my parents asked her if she wanted to come so she had to call allllllll over again and ask if she could.  AND THEY SAID YES!!! So we were at Red Lobster chillin and we ate like Royalty! LOL we had lobster, crab, shrimp, cheese thingers, cheese cake, ice cream, stuffed mushrooms, and OH! Caesar salad! We so ate like we were rich! It was awesome!  Anyways I just fell off the bed and got hurt so I am going upstairs to cry to my mommy LOL Later Gator!
