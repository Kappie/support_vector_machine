It is SOOO cool! but the problem is, if I play the fiddle in my band everyone will think I am copying yellow card and that would suck.  I am marrying the fiddle player...or the blonde guitarist.  I also saw the hives! They were good..but at times the lead singer acted a little gay so I was like "Hmm" they had the cutest suits ever!!!   Yup.. I guess that's all :)
