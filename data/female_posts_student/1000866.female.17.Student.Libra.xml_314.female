I'm just hiding in my room. That's quite fun.  So, I'm pretty sure my dog was sprayed by a skunk, and she just jumped on my bed!!! Argh, how annoying. Ah well. These things happen.  Hmmm, I think I scare Dave H. Haha. not surprising I suppose. I think I scare a lot of people.   That's just funny. I'm not sure how, but it's funny.
