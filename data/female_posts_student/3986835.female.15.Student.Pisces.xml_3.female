I mean REALLY overprotective. We were leaving the courthouse today, and she felt the need to hold my hand across the street. And while we were sitting in the office, she made me sit on her lap. You don't know how embarassing that was. But I figured if she was going to treat me like a child, I was gonna act like one. So I had to get in the back seat for something while we were picking up "her husband" from work, so I just crawled over the seat. She got pissed cuz we were in her new car. But it was funny. We're gonna go out to eat today at Red Lobster to celebrate the "wedding". I really don't wanna go, but I might as well not fight it because she'll just smack me for throwing a temper-tantrum, then buckle me up in my car seat and stick a bottle in my mouth to shut me up. I had a really bad dream last night. I was lying on the floor of a bathroom and I was bleeding horribly from my wrists. I couldn't stop bleeding, and it was scaring me. Then I looked up, and who would be standing in the doorway? Sergio, of course. And he gave me this horrible look, but he wasn't looking at me, he was kinda looking past me. So I turn to find out what he's looking at, and it turns out he's looking at my almost-dead body on the bathroom floor. That's when I realized that I was pretty much a ghost-type thing. And it wasso sad because he breaks down crying, and I can't help but do the same because...well just because I'm causing him all of this pain but there's nothing I can do about it now because it's just too late. And I cry even harder when I try to hug him and hold him and I can't. I dunno what happened after that, but I woke up sobbing. After four hours of sleep might I add. And I didn't go back to sleep after that. I couldn't I was just too scared. What if I'm like, predicting the future or something?
