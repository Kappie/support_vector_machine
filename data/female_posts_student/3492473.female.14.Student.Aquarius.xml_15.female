And I just feel like  shit . I have a lot of reasons why. Some I just can't say and others I just don't wanna get into. But I keep thinking, "why do I even do this? it's not like you guys care..." A few days ago someone told me that you just have to realize people aren't always gonna care if you're miserable. I dunno if you only enjoy my "happy" posts, all my posts *happy and sad*, or  if you even like this to begin with? ? Sometimes I don't even see a point in life. Sometimes I don't even see why I should try so hard to be everyone's friend, to get some guy to like me, to make people happy, to make myself happy, succeed, anything. I just don't see the point recently. Especially in this. I wanna write so much to you guys but people are holding me back from what I really need to say. But I guess half the stuff I need to say, I wouldn't say in here anyways. I guess you'll just have to rely on these quotes to describe how I feel.  -Sometimes, people build you up, just to knock you down.-  -Before you are accepted by your peers, you must accept yourself.-  -You break my heart into a thousand pieces and you say it's because I deserve better?-  -I think I'm afraid of being happy because every time I'm happy something bad always happens...-  Later guys...
