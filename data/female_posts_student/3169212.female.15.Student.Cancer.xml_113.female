(And it's not usually affected by gravity unless you have something on the scale of a black hole nearby.)      That's about the only solution I've been working with for the past few years anyway. I guess I'll just have to stick to it. I was just hoping there's something else I could do. I've talked around the base a bit, and the best people can tell me is to go meditate. If meditation helped cure you, I can see why my health's on the abnormal side (for me, which usually just entails a sore muscle or something) with all the racket Matt added to my peaceful little home.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill, Stargate SG-1           		  Do you Yahoo!?
