Because NASA has been isolated for so long it has decided to take an active role in promoting itself. It attended the Farnborough International Air Show to increase support for NASA. To do this they set up an exhibit that cost around $600,000. It included a space suit that people could try on. This PR move seems to have been to some degree effective, after all NASA got the New York Times to run an article on it, but I'm not sure how this will help NASA develop relationships with other Space agencies in the future.
