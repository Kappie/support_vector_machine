Shoes with funky new day-glo laces, purple vest, orange shirt. Hair being annoying.  Woolworths last night- came away with new shoelaces, a new pen and jellybeans. Saw- A man dressed in red ski wear, buying tuna and shaving cream. He kinda looked like Moses- I decided he might have just returned from being stranded atop a wintry mountain, or about to depart on a flight marked ‘Alaska’. Either way he really likes tuna. There was a boy in a faded Ramones T-shirt who bought nothing but lurked around the frozen foods section, and an Indian family with a little girl in a gold dress. Her mother couldn’t decide which toothbrush to buy- and was oblivious to the fact the little girl was slowly taking toothbrushes off the rack and dropping them into the trolley one by one. One middle-aged guy in white painter’s jeans who looked like he could either be a regretful bachelor or a tied-down husband. I checked his basket- two loaves of no name bread and a razor- and decided on the former. I had fun.    News that will most likely have an effect on any upcoming events: Cassie has the net. This is bad for two reasons: MSN is no longer safe and any extra time spent in Cassie's presence isn't so good at the moment. Hmm. Will have to ponder this further. What's worse- Her msn screename is pulled straight from Missy Higgins' "Scar" (imagine my shock/disgust). Terrible.  I did have more to write- but I'm blank now. We went shopping again today (I'm starting to think we're addicted). I wandered around for ages, attempting to find Wendy a present. Came up with zilch so ended up getting her a voucher from HMV. I bought a yo-yo.  Sigh. Cassie's online. It's so weird. There's the net world, and the real world, and Cassie belongs solely in the real world. The lines should never cross- it gets too weird.  Mum's not very happy today. Dad's home, he dislocated something in his back and then kept working and so can barely walk. All he's done is wander around being stroppy about his pathetic life. Dylan keeps suggesting things they could do together, like watching the Rolling Stones DVD we bought him for his birthday (in July) that he is yet to watch. Dad doesn't want to do any of it. Hence, Mum's pissedness. She gets sick of reassuring Dylan that Dad does love him.  I don't know. I no longer care about having a relationship with my father- I don't know him, never have known him. The last meaningful conversation we had was conducted with him clawing at my door attempting to 'break my head in'. There's always been something more important than me with him- usually it's work, but sometimes it's his own issues. I still remember when he called me over, looking like he'd just seen his own death, and told me he'd been badly abused as a child. I don't know the man's favourite food, but I know all about his fucking childhood hang-ups. What am I meant to think? Sigh. Having him around makes me angry. I haven't told anyone, but I prefer it when he's not here. He gives bad vibes.  This song...is off SFK's Echolalia- the first time I heard it I thought of my father.  Jerry Stand Up- Something For Kate  jerry stand up pull back the curtains and let some light in quit your job because you hate it and it's wasting you.  once upon a time you were running singing to the ground every morning once upon a time you were  jerry stand up am i the only one who's noticed that you've been missing remember yourself man remember that you have chance and possibility once upon a time you were running singing to the ground every morning once upon a time you were crazy  jerry you're not getting any younger all you need is fresh air a nice new suit and a walk in the park every day or two every day in every way(repeat chorus)
