The words to their songs are just amazing. I may see them at the beginning of August. Kindall,Sarah,Alana,Allison and me are all wanting to go and Kindall thinks she can get her dad to drive us. So...I'm stoked about that. Anybody who loves Christian music,buy their Sea of Faces cd. It's off the hook! Lol. urlLink
