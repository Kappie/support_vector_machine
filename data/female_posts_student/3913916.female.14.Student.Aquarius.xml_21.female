Even though it seems I have everything I don't wanna be a lonely fool All of the women All the expensive cars All of the money don't amount to you I can make believe I have everything But I can't pretend that I don't see That without you girl my life is incomplete   It seems so incomplete without something that lasted for sometime already - like a plant without the soil, a body without the soul, internet without websites, a story without words and words without letters, etc. Doesn't it feel so incomplete without that special someone for you to love? Don't you feel somethingÂ’s missing in your life?  **someone to love here means "the one," every girl's prince charming, the beauty in every beast or the girl of a guy's dreams...**  It may seem that our hearts miss something - a little piece of our hearts we're looking for in a haystack. We may not be looking for that piece at the moment, but one day, someone will hand it over to you and guess who that is? - The real "missing piece" in your heart.   August 11, 2004    Memories   It's been a while. 14 years had passed and now, my life's beginning to become very difficult. The world's change! Everything changed! As I look back, I see myself being someone I didn't think I was. It struck me to think I was like this, I was like that. But now, reality check! I've changed!  I may not be able to change the past, but I can reminisce and think about all the memories I've shared with other people; the laughter and joy; the people I've spent time with that made me become the person I am now; and all the things that changed me.  It's nice to look back at the past. I often wish to go back in that past. I loved my past. But now, I've just got to let it go, one way or another. I can't live my life with the past! As people say, "Past is Past!" But still, some other people say,"It takes time" So let's just wait and see!   August 13, 2004    All By Myself    "All by myself... Don't wanna be... All by myself!! Anymore!!..."   This day, I really felt the all alone - even though my friends and classmates are around me. I felt the emptiness inside of me. I felt how a  LONER  feels. Even towards my friends, I felt out of place. It may be my fault, too, because I don't come with them and all that. Now it just me and a "new" closer friend.   It's Been A Long Time  It's really been a while since I last went online. I missed all the chatting and surfing!! Sigh. But now, I'm back!!!   Rejection from a Friend  Here I go again, feeling lonely. Plus, REJECTED! It's like being rejected and ignored by the people close to you! Doesn't that feel *ouch!* People ignoring me... Talking to me when they have no one else to talk to... things like that! Sigh. Its just so heartbreaking!! :(
