I just walked around looking dumb wondering "What am I going to do?"  Then Miss Vasel showed up.  What a blessing.  She helped me pick out onions and peppers and salad mix.  Then we went shopping for other stuff.  We picked the prettiest boxes and bottles.  It is the only way to shop.  Fortunately, the good stuff was the cheap stuff.  I saved $13.00 with my Shaw's card.  That was exciting.  I pretty much emptied out every section I went to.  There is no more chicken, pineapple, or oriental salad mix.  So you should wait until tommorrow morning to go to Shaw's.
