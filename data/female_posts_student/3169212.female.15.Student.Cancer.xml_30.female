Cinni:  Well, about a year ago Baka invited Scrubby and me to a sleepover.  She made us watch a lot of scifi movies.  Finally we all got to sleep, only to be awakened by Baka shouting in a different language.      At first we thought she had been possessed by another demon, but as it turns out she was yelling in Spanish.      Kurama:  She does this every night?      Cinni:  Most.      (Yusuke enters)      Yusuke:  What's going on?      Kurama:  It seems Baka can speak Spanish in her sleep.      Baka:  Los monos atacan!      Kurama:  The monkeys are attacking!?      Yusuke:  Since when can you understand Spanish?      Kurama:  I took lessons.      Baka:  Mátelos!  Mátelos!      Kurama:  Kill them.  Kill them.      Baka:  Soy la morsa!      Kurama:  I am the walrus?      Yusuke:  I could'be sworn she was a fox.      Baka:  Témame!      Kurama:  Fear me.      Baka:  Molió el control a Mayor Tom.      Kurama:  Ground control to Major Tom?      Cinni;  Baka hates The Beatles, wonder why she's saying that.      Kurama:  I'm asking myself the same question.      Baka:  Los monos mascan en la pierna!      Kurama:  We're back to the monkeys.  She sais the monkeys are chewing on her leg.      Yusuke:  That's wierd.      Kurama:  I agree.
