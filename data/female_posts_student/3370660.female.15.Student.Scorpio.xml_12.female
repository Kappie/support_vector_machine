I have some sort of tan, I wear a size 1 or 3, my hair is longer with no frizz, nose is smaller, etc.   And I'll go through all these aspects I want to change, and realize that dwelling on it is exactly what is keeping me from achieving my shallow goals.  In stead of sitting at the computer all day, I could be biking outside. I could take better care of my skin. I could eat beter, feel better, exercise more, etc.  Of course...this all requires utter commitment, something I lack completely. Something that I wish was easier to grasp.  But too often, in hobby and in people, I loose interest and abandon whatever had me wishing to stay. Few things or people have ever kept my attention long. This year quite a few were able to keep me interested, to my surprise. I do hope they continue to do so these next few years.
