She's great and a huge talent but right now you can only get her cd with around four songs on it.  I think she's well worth it.  I highly recommend checking out  urlLink Amazon's  used cds for smaller releases like this.  You can get them far cheaper than you can even on  urlLink buymusic.com's site.   Granted you have to wait longer to receive it since buymusic is instantaneous download and amazon is shipped but I think it's worth it....  A while ago I heard her on some radio station and she was singing her "I'm normal please date me" song which cracks me up and then when I saw her last week when she opened for Howie Day she impressed the hell out of me.  Especially since I had no interest in seeing either of the bands playing before him.  I only wish she had gone on before Howie Day instead of Jump, Little Children who I was not all that impressed with.  So anyway, I would check her out... it's a chick and a piano and she's friggin talented.
