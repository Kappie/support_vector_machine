I must admit I'm dreading it, I've already got a list forming of everything I need to get done before we leave. Top of that list - teach self Trigonometry. Which wouldn't suck nearly as much if I hadn't been cheated out of learning proper fractions/ratios and how to factor when I was in elementary. Boo to those teachers who opted out of math for art!  I'm back on a Canadiana kick... woohoo for me.. haha... Bought a new book with one of the longest title I've ever seen on a 'recreational read'.. "The Darkness That Comes Before - The Prince of Nothing Book One" by Canadian Author R. Scott Bakker. Its said to out-Tolkien Tolkien. When I first endeavoured to try and read Tolkien I couldn't understand a thing, it was hard to follow, so hah.. in that aspect i can believe it! So heres to wishing me luck in understanding this Prince of Nothing stuff. Biggest thing yet though... KYPRIOS... spread the word, this Vancity (Vancouver for those not paying attention... ) underground scene MC is fantastic (this coming from a Sarah Mclachlan fan) in an eminem meets Canada kinda way. I'm pretending I'm ignorant of his ruder MC'ing and lyrics, but his debut video "This is My Hit" rocks... my opinion, but check it out...   urlLink  Kyprios Online     "Sky is falling, the earth is erupting, don't believe everything you hear, kid, trust me. Analyze. Got a question, ask it. Don't be a market pig for a specific demographic. 14 and a girl? Your the #1 target in the world."    Maybe I'm just in a mood for strong statements... or maybe I'm just tired.. sleeps been out the window the last 4 nights for....various non-sleeping reasons... Stressing over work that needs to get done.. yeaa... sucks.. but ah well NOT COMPLAINING! (yet anyways...)
