Then we went to Cyberspace cafe to drop off a DVD that I accidentally left in the DVD player. Ah well, can't complain, I got to see Nick once more. He didn't really pay that much attention to me, but I'd seen him earlier today and we had talked earlier and stuff, plus he was playing Quake, which is fine. I mean, he doesn't get to go chill with his friends that much, so I can't expect him to drop everything just for me ALL the time. Umm, not that I expect him to EVER drop everything he's doing just for me. That wouldn't be right.  lol. I'm in such a good mood now that I've exercised.  I don't think anything could make me mad at the moment. We went to Dairy Queen after graduation, and got a salad (good) and ice cream (good, but bad for ya). Then we dropped Randall off at Joe's, then I drove home. Two horses and a guy ran out in front of my car!!! I had no idea what it was. I was SO glad that I wasn't going more than 40 mph, or I might have hit one of em. That wouldn't have been good at all.  So yeah, that's about all that's happened since my last blog.  Tommorrow I'm going to Chelsea's house and DJ's, then on Saturday we're going to see Shrek2!!!! I can't wait!!! Ah well, I suppose I'll HAVE to wait, won't I? woohoo! okay, I'm shutting up now Love, Shannon "In the wee small hours of the morning, that's the time you'll miss him most of all."
