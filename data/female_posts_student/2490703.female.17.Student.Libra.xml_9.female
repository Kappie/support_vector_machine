WOO HOO! I'm going to Cedar Point tomorrow for Physics. I'm pretty excited. My group is just Amanda Allmendinger and I. We'll have fun seeing as how her and I both aren't roller coaster people. It should be great fun. Are you coming up for my open house? I'm not sure what day it is...My mother keeps changing it. It's like she can't make up her mind. Oh well, whatever day it is, you should come! You could possibly come to my graduation if you come up for the weekend. I graduate on June 6th. Just let me know hun! Um...Your thing didn't save. I don't know if you saved it. Nothing has really happened today. I went to school, cheated on my physics test, went through the rest of the day. After school I went to Physical therapy for the bum leg...now I'm home typing to you. How did you're thing go for the ticket? I hope well...Hopefully you still have a driver's license! I still haven't talked to my dad. I told him I didn't want him at graduation...like he actually cares. He's only going because my mom would be mad at him if he didn't. The way I see it, he didn't care for 13 years...why does he all the sudden care. Oh Wait...he doesn't. But yeah, I have to go finish my things. You'll be getting one in the mail soon! I love ya hun! Talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa
