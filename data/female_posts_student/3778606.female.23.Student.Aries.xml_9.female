Viola, i now have a new kitty. she is gray and fluffy as hael. however, this morning i couldnt find her so i think chica may have already offed her in an attempt to claim her spot back as the "cute pet."  another note, me and the filipino are no longer. he flipped out and almost got into three fights last friday, which would nomally not be a big deal, except he tried to blame the fights on me, get his friends to fight them for him, and then yelled at me in front of everyone at la bamba for being a "free food whore" and eating nachos with his friends. he has major insecurity issues that i do not want to deal with right now. i personally do not think that he is worth it. plus he has this tendency to wig out, apologize all lovey dovey and then yell at me all over again. i first i thought it was funny, then i thought that he has major issues. he is one of those people that attack your character whenever they feel cornered and say some really bogus, uncalled for things and then pull a "babe, come here. i'm just kidding." and then i am like "...." and then he answers with "fuck you then. fuck it, i'm done. go date my friend so he can buy you nachos. your shit aint that great anyway." as if he knows anything about my "shit" cos if he did, he wouldnt be able to walk right now. haha, syke.   but seriously. i coulda busted out some "your penis looks like a funsize snickers" but i took the high road and just ended it instead of being infantile and bitter. he is still calling me but blocking his number. i told him friday night i was done, then he called sat and left an apologetic message, followed by the "your shit aint that great" message when i didnt call him back, then i actually answered a call just to tell him to stop calling and he tried to get back with me again. since then he has called me from multiple numbers and even with a "private number" setting. the dumbfuck called me right after he called from his number though, so it wasnt exactly fuckin hard to figure out it was him. the scarry thing is that he knows where i live, work and what kind of car i drive. yikes. i can take him though, he's like five nine and 145, if even. i got this.  well, time to die in a tornado.  piece-  mo
