The fact that she was more then mildly drunk was the reason of her telling me this. It was pretty funny. Rofo, of course had more Tyler troubles. I didn't bitch at her, but i came close. I can't say anything, she'll get all bitchy and hard to live with and I don't feel like having to deal with it. It's to much effort. I woke up this morning and my heart sank, it was raining really hard and I thought that it would be raining until like feis and no one would come. Everyone did come though. And the earwigs were out in full force, they were crawling all over my shoes. Derek got his licence, and he has an awsome car. It's not his parents car or anything either, its this car he bought and like restored himself. Yeah, he's part of the orgional "car guy" group. Most of the real car guys graduated this year, so there aren't really many left. Sad really, I'm running out of people to turn to in case something goes wrong and I need it to get fixed. Yeah, so everyone was saying that tonight sucked, until the booze arrived, then everyone was like wooo! this night is awsome! So I got to listen to jackie and shann and alicia tell about their drunk stories. It was funny as hell. Jackie has a problem sitting still, and she really likes to sing when she is drunk. I love it. Alicia is a chatty drunk too, though in a more serious way. And Jill, will jill is crazy... she isn't called "Lushious" for nothing. Emily and Stepthen hooked up tonight. People were kind of saying something along the lines of "finially!". I dyed my bangs blue today, though it turned out more sea green. I'm pretty happy with the color. Its better then I thought it would be. Oh and I got my $20 for working at the bar. I'm happy, I have drinking money now, only it probably wont be used for that. I don't really like drinking that much anymore. I hate the taste. Getting drunk can be fun, when you're drunk but having to consume all those fluids, well it isnt fun. And I'll only have to piss it all out in like two hours anyway, so it's not to great. I'm going to the repile show tomorrow with Jamie, I cant fucking wait. Like this will probably be the highlight of my summer, so long as there aren't a bunch of people around, and in that case I'll just freak. Oh yeah, and my hair smells like a mix ofkool aid and lavander. It makes me hungry. Anyway, thats all I can think of. I'll post more if anything else comes to mind.
