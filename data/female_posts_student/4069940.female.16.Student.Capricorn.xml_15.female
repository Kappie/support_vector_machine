Well, we were there for 5 days, and a lot happened.  The weather wasn’t that great while we were there, but we had so much fun anyway.  You learn a lot of things when you spend a long time period of time with someone, and I, like any other, learned on this trip.  For one, Brianna is a card shark.  I have found, however, that I can beat her at speed, if I hold nine cards in my hand at once instead of five, when she isn’t looking.  The second thing is, we are both very willing to try new things, such as swimming in the -54 degree water in the pouring down rain, or float down the VERY rocky river in just lifejackets.  The third thing, my brother and his friend, eat every single second of the day.  Here is how a typical day would go: Brianna and I would wake up at around 10 because Chris and Mitch would be so loud while they ate, then we would turn over and go back to sleep, only to wake up at 12/12:30ish, ready to start the day.  Then, we would usually go swimming, play cards, go swimming, go hiking a mile to the bathroom, go swimming, take showers and do CROSSWORD PUZZLES!!!  That’s another thing.  I found out something about myself on this trip.  I suck at crossword competitions.  Brianna spends a great deal of time at her dads house, doing crosswords, so she is really good, and I am...less than perfect.  Anyway, the week was eventful, and I had a blast, it’s been real Brianna..(Oh my gosh you guys!! He just drank, like a gallon, of chocolate milk...)
