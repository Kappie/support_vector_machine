Today a new annoyance is born.  He has taken to bringing in a cassette tape and listening to it loudly at his desk.  Ordinarily this would annoy me a) because its rude to have your personal music loud to the point where its interfering with people's work and phone calls, but it gets worse.  Oh yes, worse my friends.  You see this tape is some evil creation he mixed himself consisting of all Spanish music ranging from salsa, to a Spanish Kenny-G to the worst thing that you could possibly hear all day long on loop:  The Spanish Version of the Macarena.   Yes, the macarena.  Apparently no one got the memo that its not 1997 anymore and the macarena is still not cool.  For the better part of the last two hours I've been hearing this crap and to make things worse: he's taken to singing along with it.  Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bitch and everyone in my office is complaining about it, but  urlLink I don't like confrontations,  so I suffer in silence as the tape gets flipped and the Latino goodness starts anew.  92 days and counting 'til I'm out of here.  Start hedging your bets as to whether or not I'll make it.  I've got my money on me snapping or trying to get fired before my time comes.    Happy Monday, childrens.
