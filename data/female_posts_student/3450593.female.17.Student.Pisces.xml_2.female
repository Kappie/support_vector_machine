"O'REILLY = Well, let me tell you, if the Lord had meant us to worry, he would have given us things to worry about. BASIL = He HAS! My WIFE! She will be back here in four hours and she can kill a man at ten paces with one blow of her tongue! How am I supposed not to worry?!"  "BASIL = I'll ruin you! You'll never waitress in Torquay again!"  "BASIL = Don't touch me! I don't know where you've been."  "BASIL = Is something wrong? GERMAN = Will you please stop talking about the War? BASIL = Me? You started it!  GERMAN = We did not start it. BASIL = Yes you did, you invaded Poland!"  "GUEST = I expected to see the sea.

Preferably in it."   "GUEST: Could you make me a Waldorf Salad? BASIL: Oh, ... ah, ... wa? GUEST: Waldorf Salad? BASIL: I think we are just out of Waldorfs."  "BASIL: Oh, you're GERMAN! Sorry, I thought there was something wrong with you!"  "BASIL: I'll put an ad in the papers. Wanted, kind home for enormous savage rodent. Answers to the name of Sybil."
