I was going to go to Karaoke at the bar on Friday night, go to a party down at the harbour front on Saturday and go to my friend's Jack and Jill on Saturday night. Well, I did end up going to Karaoke on Friday night. Woke up Saturday with a hangover from the zambooka. I will only get up and sing if I've had a little bit to drink. Otherwise, I'm not ahle to gather the nerve. So, did that, it was fun. Anyway, my hangover ruined Saturday morning for me. So, I stayed in bed, took a zillion Tylenol's, then got my ass out of bed. My hunnie went over to visit his bro, and I decided that I was bored, so when Derrick called me, I told him I wanted to go over with the kids. Its only across the street. Well, so much for the Harbor Front party and the Jack and Jill. I took the kids, a lot of Derrick's family was there, and his brother and wife bought a Karaoke machine. So, that's about it. We had a big old Newfie karaoke bash. I didn't drink too much though, because I didn't want to feel like shit again.  In continuation to my little 'problem' regarding my friend that takes me for granted.... Well well well, she pissed me off again tonight. I don't know if I mentioned it in my last post or not, but she also gives out my UNLISTED phone number to guys that she has met over the web... Hasn't even met them in person yet. I've had enough guys phoning here, her work phones here, everyone phones here, and its pissing me off. Well, I was on the phone earlier tonight, and my other line beeped. So, I didn't bother answering it, because I was on a rather important phone call. I checked my voice mail after, because someone left a message. Well, here its her, calling from a payphone to tell me yet ANOTHER guy is going to be phoning her tonight at my place and would I please just take a message! Like, what the fuck do I look like a fuckin' answering service? Some guy from Ireland... or is this one from Cali, I dunno. Who knows, who cares? See, she has no phone of her own. She HAD a phone. She HAD a cell phone. But, didn't pay the bills. So, they got cut. Like, lets not misconstrew things. She was not calling me from a payphone tonight to ASK if this guy could call. She called to tell me to take a message because she had already given him my number and was expecting him to call. Nerve or what? I can't believe it! Derrick is MAD! This isn't the first time. I have 2 small kids here who don't need to be woken up in the middle of the night because of this shit. She called and informed me at 10:30pm, so obviously she told him to call at any time, because she said "He said he will call me tonight". I'm sick of it.  Anyway, aside from that, today was Father's Day. Went up to my mom's for a Father's Day dinner. It was nice. Cold salads, bbq'd burgers. Pretty delicious! Cake for dessert! Yummmmmmmmmm.  That's it!
