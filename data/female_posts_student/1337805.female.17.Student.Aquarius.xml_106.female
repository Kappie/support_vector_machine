Had dream that this gorgeous hunk from a past that mom knew (I dont know where I knew him from) came and rescued me. I'm dying to know who he was, he was a dream. Now that I've woken up, I feel so empty in here, like I've actually broke up with him. It hurts.  He was this 6'6, incredibly nice, guy, who forever reason rescued me from the harshness of church, and when I saw him i ran up and gave him the hugest hug....Like I've known him my entire life... I'm going to the dream dictionarys on this one...
