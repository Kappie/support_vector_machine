Spent some money we didn't have and added 3 new books to the pile of "Love that I have it, but will probably never read it" finds.  There's just something about new books.  Don't know what it is, but they're fucking dead sexy.  And there's just something about sitting in a coffee shop mauling the new purchases all over, coming home and rubbing them in hot love juices that seals the deal.  Then, years and many memories later, when they're pulled off the shelf, they get to be new all over again!    I honestly have no business bringing home new books at this point.  I've been reading the same novel for 2 months and have barely cracked the 200 page mark.  Plus, I'm running out of room for them.  I would be more justified bringing home abandoned baby kittens.  But for now, they're the newest, coolest books ever and there was much rejoicing.   Just chilling back at the pad for a bit before hitting the night life with the much-talked-about Bridget and her steady beau Dave.  Then we're back on the Boy's agenda:  movies, magazines and sex.  I would rather curl up with the new bookies, Civil Procedure and tea from Goldie, but I mean, whatever the Boy wants he gets.
