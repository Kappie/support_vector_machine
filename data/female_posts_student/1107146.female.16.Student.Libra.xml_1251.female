I want everyone to know, though, that if you ever need anything...food, a person to talk to, anything, just call me.  Lindsey has my phone number and my e-mail is gourmetchef13@hotmail.com....obviously I'm good at the cooking part and my friends say that I am a very good listener.  Josh, I really hope you are alright.  And I hope that you still find a reason for life.  And, Linds, I need more people to put down as room-mates for choir tour.
