I like avoided eye contact and any possible contact w/ Brad when we first got there. But the four of us made Brad's gift. It was hott. I took a pic. Newho, we made a t-shirt that said: Happy Birthday, Mighty Lord of the Dinos, Princess Brad. We made him a crown *my head was used to model it lol* that said Princess Brad and it had dinosaurs in the background *hence lord of the dinos* and we made a 'magical' sceptor, a cape, and a necklace. Our gift was the greatest, that's all there is to it. So yea, we explained that I was Betsy's date, he gave us one of those 'OMG, ur f-in CRAZY' looks and it was all good after that. Cept for when we were attacked by water guns and water balloons. Maddy, Betsy, n I wore white shirts...go figure something like that would happen. The party continued. We stole a bowl of chips, ate cake *it was delicious*We played air hockey w/ teams. Brad volunteered to be on my team and then he scratched my hand so I have a one-two inch gash on my hand that really stings. He gave me a hug after that, and he gave me a hug for another reason but I don't remember what it was. It was weird. *shrugs* Then me n Trevor played air hockey, went for the puck at the same time, it flew up, hit the ceiling, and a piece of the ceiling chipped. I was like silent and in shock at first. Then we spazzed and I was like dude, that was the greatest thing EVER. We embraced for our deed of the day and literally left a mark. We then all played cards...I kicked for a while, but then I did TERRIBLE at speed mainly because Brad cheated *scoffs* he is such a girl...all whiny n crap...he's always pms-in bout something...lol jk, jk. that's me. And no cheating, my A.D.D. kicked in and I was talkin to about 5 other people while playing. O yea, and we watched The Exorcist...I laughed so hard. I couldn't help it. I think that movie's funny. I guess it was more fun than I thought it would be. It was boring in the beginning, and people were confused as to why I wasn't invited but proud of me for rebelling against the system and showing up anyway. It was decided that I was supposed to be invited but Brad was kind of in denial. I guess that was the whole party...I'm prolly missing some more hilarious stuff but I'm like dead. The moral of today *or yesterday, since it's 12 somethin*: People should sneak into other people's parties more often!  ps. Tasha, when's the riot? Or is it cancelled again?
