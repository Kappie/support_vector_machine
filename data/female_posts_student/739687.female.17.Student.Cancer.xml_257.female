I've been really happy lately. You know, maybe I really do have some sort of seasonal depression...because this could possibly be due to the season changes...or even the fact that I've been working out a bunch lately. Nevertheless...whatever the reasons, this is good.  "...it's hard to see the pain behind a mask; bearing the burden of a secret storm, sometimes she wishes she was never born."  Ughh, I'm actually having some shitty allergies as of late. Typically, I really don't have bad allergies, but occasionally my eyes get watery and I sneeze a bunch. Ehh, no biggie. I'm kinda having trouble breathing too...and I can tell it's allergy related. I have this whole breathing thing where my sternum gets inflamed and blocks my lungs from expanding all the way sometimes...but that doesn't happen too often and it's a different sort of feeling. Haha it's crazy weird.  Anyways, that's enough rambling. Stay cool, crazies.
