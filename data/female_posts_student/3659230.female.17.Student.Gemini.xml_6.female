There is too much going on with 1. my mothers people, 2. my dad's declining health, 3. relationship difficulties, 4. myself, 5. the possible selling of our home, and the more and more I've been isolating myself from people the worse things seem to get. i thought if that if i stay to myself for a while that maybe i can sort out this mess myself. I guess that maybe its time to just go out and talk about whatevers on my mind because keeping all of these thoughts to myself. lately it feels like i can't really say whats on my mind to those that i usually do and if i do decide to give them a snippet its extremely editted and i don't really like doing that. i wish i could talk to people honestly now but i can't. it kind of worries me that the people who are closest to me can't tell that theres something up with me, am i putting on that good of a show.
