She untangles herself from the sheets and shivers as the cold air hits her bare legs. She stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, looks away ashamedly and pulls a robe on, completely covering her body. She looks up again and pushes her hair away from her face, trying to ignore the dark circles under her eyes and the chapped lips, and the freckles that dot her nose. The flaws, in her mind. She pulls her door open and steps quietly into the hallway, padding down to the bathroom. She steps into the hot spray and tries to ignore the feeling of the scorching water on fresh wounds. When she’s done she pulls the robe back over her body and puts her hair up in a towel. She gets ready for school, sighing and sincerely hoping that she’ll miss the bus and won’t be able to get there, or that no one will wake up and she can sneak back to bed.   	Not that this helps. She’s perfect. The perfect child, the perfect ideal teenager, the perfect student. She wouldn’t miss the bus, wouldn’t sneak back to bed, and wouldn’t go against her parents’ wishes.  	The Victim slings her backpack over her shoulder and winces as it hits the cuts slicing up and down her upper arms. She grabs a roll and her keys and lets herself out. She walks a block to her bus stop and sits down with loud music and waits for her bus. When it arrives she carefully avoids her fellow students eyes and sits down near the back of the bus, alone, and keeps her headphones back on to ensure her “Don’t bother trying” appearance.    	When she gets to school she quietly puts her things in her locker and waves hi to her friends, putting on her mask, putting up her façade, smiling to avoid questions and walks with them to class.   	She’s been doing this for years. No one suspects a thing. Not her best friend, not her boyfriend, not her teachers, not her parents, not her pastor.   	She works through classes, answering the questions asked of her with unwavering clarity and completion, with as little words as possible. At lunch she sits with her friends, and laughs and jokes with them. She cuddles close to her boyfriend, eats a normal lunch, and finishes the HW she let slide the night before. When the bell rings she waves goodbye to her friends and kisses her boyfriend. She walks to her next class, which is advanced something or other. All of her classes are advanced. It’s expected. She sits down. Not in the front where she’s in the view of everyone, Not in the back where people are always called on, but in the middle to the side. None of her friends are in this class. The Teacher comes in and announces that as soon as the Homework has all been put on his desk, there will be a pop quiz.  	The Victim forgot to do her homework. The Victim freezes. The Victim fails the quiz.  	When normal people fail a quiz they move on and try to do better next time. When the average student fails a quiz they laugh it off with their friends and figure out what they did wrong so as not to do it again. Even when typical anal-retentive students fail a quiz they request extra credit and hope not to fail the next one. The Victim cannot function as a typical student, the Victim is otherwise, The Victim has a problem. She can’t just go with it, can’t just let it go, must punish herself. So The Victim excuses herself from class and lets the mask slip, lets the walls down, unleashes her problem. She pulls out a compass in the bathroom and slits at every concealed piece of skin she can, that’s not already covered in small scratches. She dries the blood, washes her hands, and calmly walks back to class.  	Still no one knows, still no one suspects.  Still no one asks.  	The Victim puts herself back on automatic pilot and finishes the school day. She waves to her friends on her way out, and as if in reverse from earlier removes her things from her locker and walks through masses of people hugging and kissing and laughing on her way to the bus. She puts her headphones back on and imagines that she is at a concert, surrounded by complete strangers, and able to be totally uninhibited. She closes her eyes and tries to picture what life would be like if she could start over, what she would do, and what it would be like to live her own life. She wanted to imagine a life, instead of the life her parents wanted, or her teachers knew she was “Capable of”, to live as she wanted instead of what her friends expected. The bus lurches to a stop and she quickly and quietly picks up her things and nearly runs off the bus in her hurry to be unnoticed. She unlocks the front door and drops her stuff at the foot of the stairs, on her way to the living room where she checks the messages on the answering machine. There is one, on her mailbox, telling The Victim that her parents are going to be late tonight, and to make her own dinner and “not to wait up”. She rolls her eyes, and progresses to the kitchen where she scopes out food possibilities. Deciding there is nothing of any quality in the fridge or the pantry, she decides to invite some friends over to study and order a pizza. She calls them and a few of them can come, so she tells them to be there at 6, and continues on her way up to her room, grabbing her bag on the way.   	When The Victim gets upstairs and opens her bag to start her homework. She gets about halfway through and stops being able to focus. She tries for another few minutes and then stops, takes a breath, and fishes around in one of her drawers for a razor blade. She begins the process of enjoying the cut, her game, her life. She has cut parts of her stomach and around her elbows when she hears the downstairs door open. She had forgotten the small, insignificant fact that both her boyfriend and her best friend knew where the spare key is hidden. She hears her best friend call “Hello? We’re here, are you upstairs?” and the sound of footsteps on the stairs.   She has finally been caught.  	She shoves the blade under the bed and attempts to cover, to conceal, to hide, to put her mask back on. But it’s too late, the strings have been cut, the mask has been broken, and the shards have been thrown away and there is no where to hide. The door opens and in comes her best friend, followed closely by her boyfriend.   	They pause, staring at the horror in front of them, and then as one they kneel and envelope her in deep hugs and when she finally begins to cry, to unleash months and years of pain and terror, they let her. They let her tell, they let her out of the locked room she’s been hiding in, they listen. And then they clean up and cleanse her wounds, and her boyfriend kisses the tears off of her face, and they get ready to call her parents, to call for help,  To face the world again, to face the world head on, to face the world together.  To live.        	A/N: In my research I found that those who cut are often victims of abuse, whether emotional or physical, or victims of rape, and are often either withdrawn or overly social, and can often be consumed by an eating disorder. I decided that it would be more reflective of the gravity of situations like this to add a sense of anonymity to the character, and therefore to simply call her The Victim. Regardless of whether they’re doing it for show or for real, whether they were abused or not, whether they’re anorexic or healthy, cutters are victims. Cutters can be victims of actual physical problems, or victims of emotional problems, but anyone who would take a sharp object to their skin is the victim of an idea; the idea that pain can be fought with pain, that cutting is going to make things better, that self-harm and self-mutilation are going to somehow keep them from having to face the world.
