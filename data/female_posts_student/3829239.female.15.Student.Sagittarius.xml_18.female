We had lots more to fill it up with, but oh well. Well Camille stopped by later and spent the night here. I dyed her hair, and then straightened it while watching Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time believe it or not! Okay, the movie isn't even all that great, why does everyone make such a big deal out of it? Anyway, today we went to Six Flags, it was Jeanette, Camille, Alek, and me. Boy, oh boy, Alek has a nice bod. We saw a bunch of Adan's friends there......including Elias. His hair looked nice. They were on the train when we saw them, and I think only Eric noticed us, but I don't really care. Aww, it was so cute Alek and me sat on this boulder type thing and watched fireworks during the Lone Star Spectacular, or whatever it's called, anyway, yea it was cute. Jeanette told me afterwards, "I just want you to know that that was one of the best experiences I've ever had, just watching you two sitting on the rock, and then you pushing him off was cool," or something along those lines..........real nice. On the way to drop off Alek back home we were dancing and singing in the car, which was fun, though it didn't last very long.... Then I took his hat, and he told me to hold it for him until Friday when I see him at registration, and he asked me to wash it, what's up with that? ha. Well I'm hungry, so I'm outta here, catch ya on the flip flop.
