I hadn't been there since 6th grade...and it actually was kinda fun. Saturday my mother and I went shopping. Now, I shall interrupt this review for a quick, embarrassing, retarded story:  So my mom and I are shopping. And I was looking at shoes n such and I found this really cute pair of clear heels. If you know anything about me, I love heels. LOVE them. Clear ones especially. So I was like "hey, I'm gonna try these on"...so I try them on but don't really walk around in them, just kinda stand and see how they fit. And I liked them mucho, so I bought them. Well when I got home I tried them on and I started to walk around and suddenly noticed something down at my feet:  flashing lights.  Yes...it is true....they fucking light up. I started cracking up, out of stupidity for buying them and not even reading the damn tag that says "yes...they light up!" Ooooh so I have a certain return to make.  Okay back to weekendness. Saturday evening I worked from 5-11,  then went home and then to Steven's house. Well, my parents said I had to be home at 1:30 and well...that doesn't work for me. So I came home, yes, around 1:45 or so and 'went to bed'. AKA waited till about 2:45 and crawled out my window. Oh yeah, what a rebel. Rofl. It was kinda fun though. Knowing that it actually WORKS. I got home around 5:30. And so far so good.  Now now, time for homework. Then I'm gonna read some.  Special special awesome freakin great, crazies.
