But, I guess the only way to get it out is to say everythinh here.  First, my life was changed a week ago and I can't go back to what was "normal". I can't go throughout a day without thinking about the whole accident, reliving every detail. I hate people talking about it, I hate all the pictures. I just wish it'd all go away and I could forget it ever happened. Now, I live in this fear of something bad happening again. I'm afraid to drive, I'm afraid to sleep, I'm afraid to die. And I know that was a freak accident, and the chances of that ever happening again is very slim. I miss my life before the accident, I miss my car, I miss my life free of pain and worry. I try to be strong, for everyone, I want to be stong, but it's hard.  Now, I'm worried about my back, I have this never-ending pain, that I'm scared will never go away. Every time I move, I can feel this pressure and it scares me. I want everything to be alright, I want all this to go away. I WANT MY LIFE BACK! No amount of money or whatever I get from the accident, will make this go away. I can't even sleep anymore and if I do get to sleep its light and I end up waking up about 3 times during the night anyways.   I want to feel stress free, pain free. I want to forget all that has happened and gone on with life. I feel the only way I'd feel safe, is if I was laying in David's arms and then I could forget everything else and just be happy. But, for now, that's not going to happen. I'm just going to have to deal with this by myself as best as I can. I'm scared and alone...
