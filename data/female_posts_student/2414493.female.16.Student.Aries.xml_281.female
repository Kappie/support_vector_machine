Upon coming home, Mom tells me someone called but forgets the name. I end up bothering Mrs. Battaglia at 10:30pm before calling Mrs. Burkett. I'm so sorry for bothering Mrs. B.   And then even before that, I was sad.   Wait, no, even now. The email was unpromisingly glib. It quoted me. I hate that.  Oh I feel like cussing right now, haha. Roller coaster like none other. I don't feel like explaining. I have Leni Fe Friday, SATIIs Saturday, got roundly yelled at, am going to have to explain to Dad why there's $85 at Tuscany on his credit card, had to say goodbye to Dad today, have Spanish hw, realized I might not ever see people like Pegleg and co. ever again, and I bothered Mrs. Battaglia.  For a few hours at dinner, I forgot that I was troubled, and now it's all coming back to me. I've reclaimed it by coming home. Dad isn't going to be here for two weeks. Piano competition. SATIIs. Making people happy. Making myself happy.   I don't know, maybe all I need now is someone to talk to.
