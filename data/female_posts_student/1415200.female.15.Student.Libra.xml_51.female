The guys (Harry, Dan, Joe, maybies Bob?) are comming over, and are bringing there instruments! What a first! They won't be here until noon-ish. That means I hafta practice my part and stuff before then. Yeah. I was in a really good mood yesterday.   Was.  I don't understand anything anymore. I thought I had a concept of how everything worked, but I dont. I totally have no clue.  Remember back in like 4th grade, we would have to wear nametags and go around the room saying how we felt and things like that?  I wish I could do that again.  Later when the guys leave, I am going to have a horror movie marathon. Maybies. I might call Rachel Martin and see what she's up to this Valentines Day. Then we could go TO THE MALL! Yesh! Our Plans!   For the record. My 'curse' is gone.   People are really stupid. I felt like I should make that known. Yeah I might go see Trapt on the 17th. That would be so awesome. There playing up in Struthers for $15. I dont know if I really want to go, but Dad is excited about it, and that's rad.  Track starts in less han a month. That is so kickass. I gotta go get my physical, and I hafta go get new shoes. The last pair dissapeared. I have no clue where they went. Im gonna go listen to Brand New.  Im also going to go make a Anti-Valentines Day mix. Haha! Im sucha lozer! Yay!
