There were 3 choirs, 8 lead singers, a huge orchestra that included a mandolin, 2 pianos, pipe organ, tubular bells and cymbals...it was SO majestic!! I wanna watch it again!! Especially the finale...it was absolutely, totally brillant. Before that, i had a pleasant dinner wif Zab at Thai Express...the curry chicken  pineapple rice was fab...service was good too...tt's why service charge added up to a grand total of $1.58 *argh* Anyway, after dinner, we walked around, but everything was so expensive; or maybe we were just poor...haha. After that, Zab bought cotton candy and we sat near the river, enjoying the view of the sunset. So romantic.Haha. Then it was time to meet J. He called then i went to find him...at first, we hardly recognized each other but we eventually did anyway. Passed the precious ticX to him and we awkwardly went our "separate ways". Haha...i had hoped that we would be able to start a conversation, but when i went there, i guess everything just went blank. Haha...nvm. I'm still in awe of the massive majesty of Mahler's symphony...haven't recovered yet...dun wanna cos it's so nice. I hope they perform it again...sigh...i wish the night didn't have to end. :(
