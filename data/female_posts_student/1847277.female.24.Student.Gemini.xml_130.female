I had this dream where I couldn't figure out what a bone was and was terrified that I would misidentify it, but, really, if I misidentified a bone or two it certainly wouldn't be the end of the world.  I mean, gobs of the stuff I'm working with no was supposedly identified to species by someone, but it's wrong a great percentage of the time, and it's not the end of the world- just a little bit more work for me.  Matt told me this terrible story about my cat, in that it fell out of a third story window onto a wooden deck.  But I guess she's okay.  Or she seems to be okay.  I hope she is.  Ahh.  I'm sleepy.  And this chair reclines rather nicely, so maybe I'll just close my eyes.....  ZzZZZZzzzZZZZZZZZzzz
