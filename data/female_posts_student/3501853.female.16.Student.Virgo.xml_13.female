So that made me pissed then me and Tim got this one movie Paycheck to watch, wow it was so fucking horrible. It had to have been the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, I kid you not. Do not watch Paycheck people, it sucked ass and Ben Afleck can not act...'He' had a bad day yesterday, I couldn't help cuz we don't really talk...but regardless of how much I care, right now, I just hope he feels better. Someone let me have that much of a wish since nothing else is ever gonna come true. Hmm today Arthur wanted to get breakfast but we had no rides so we put a raincheck on it then I watched Dawson's Creek good stuff then I talked to Kev for a bit til he left but hopefully we'll hang out before I leave for California just so I can get my saves the day cds back lol JK I just wanna see the loser and hang out w/him a lot lots. I'm glad that I at least haven't managed to fuck up me and kevin, we've fought once before but I don't ever wanna do it again. Ana called today and we were on the phone then out of nowhere my doorbell rings and these 2 guys are like gluing up my driveway to fix it up I guess but I go outthere, my night shirt only, and they don't even say anything to me..wow, it was very freaky. I was like shouting at Ana after that cuz I was just very freaked out. They left after an hour thank goodness. I watched Mona Lisa Smile and it made me cry cuz it reminded me of how much I miss two of my best friends. Overall, it was good tho, good actresses in it. It made me miss acting but I suck at it now. Oh welll. I got ready for work after that and I blasted 99.5 and a good song was on..k ya..work's gonna suck but oh well, there's a game on tonight, I doubt the Lakers will win but I'm still wishing for it...
