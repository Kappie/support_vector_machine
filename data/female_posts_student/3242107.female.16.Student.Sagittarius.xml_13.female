EXACTLY! it sucks major. because she never really HAD to have a job until her senior year bc she didnt get her license until she was already 17. my bad, im sorry i had to be the middle child, im sorry i had to have an older sibling to ruin it for me, im sorry i had to be the child that wanted to be ahead and life and start drivign before her. ugh and i swear she hates me. my aunt told me that steph never liked me  since i was a baby. and my mom even said steph stopped liking me the day she realized i wasnt going anywhere after i was born.  thanks for letting me know right?!?! how about not. so ugh my dad went and made me cry and storm out, then my mom came in my room and gave me this long speech how i was over exaggerating and crap and ugh. it made me so mad. i cant wait to get out of here. screw texas, im leaving... as soon as i graduate. my mom was like, sara, we told your sister we would pay for her tuition and that she would be on her own otherwise. if i had known id be paying her insurance and bills for 4 years, it wouldnt have happened. and then ugh ... so yea there steph goes again. why do they have to hold me,.... sara, the 16 year old daughter, to as high of a level as steph- a 21 year old daughter. its not fair at all that they do this all the time. and todays not the only time. my dad has to throw it in all the time. like the night of a game after we get back and i did good, and im excited and he just has to spend a minute yelling at me and nagging to go and ruin it. and thats atleast 2 times a week. but im going to my aunts tomorrow for mothers day, so im sure i'll hear about it plenty.
