Let me juz start from e beginnin..  He was my senior back in sec skool.. We met online but nv reli talked at skool.. He was always surrounded by girls n i reli cudnt be bothered wif him.. He wasnt my type anyways.. He was rather flirtatious,wadya expect.. but i haf to admit, he had such a gorgeous smile tat he cud melt any girl.. anyways, lost contact wen he graduated.. tot id nv see him agn.. guess wat, i did.  On June 21 '03, we met in a small alley(out of e many places here in singapore) at East Coast.. he couldnt even remb my name den.. but we got in touch n became close.. den i screwed it up by runnin my mouth n he disappeared.. i didnt reli care cos i got sick of him always bein so hung up on his ex gf.. Then, on May 23 '04, tat fateful day.. we bumped in e train.. i heard somebody shout my name,soundin so excited.. i wondered who e heck tat was.. i turned around, n der he was.. wif tat gorgeous smile.. Exchanged no n things juz took off from der.. we always met n hung out.. n in an unexpected twist of events.. he fell for me. i had told myself b4 tat i wud nv EVER fall for him.. so i kept runnin away, always in denial of how i felt.. i wanted him so bad but i also didnt wn end up hurt again.. ive bn scarred enuff.. But he got thru to me somehow n i decided to let my heart free..  It felt so perfect, juz bein wif him.. so comfortable.. he always makes me laugh n always keepin me happy.. he made me feel so secure, so loved, so wanted, so good about myself.. No guy has ever done tat or haf tat much effect on me like he did.. he's truly special to me.. but now he's disappeared once more n im so devastated.. y is he doin tis to me ? did i do somethin wrong ? was everythin juz a lie... ? y did god make me meet him only to let him slip away once more.. y is he bein so cruel.. ive got so many qns but no ans.. im so confused.. sms,calls.. none were replied.. it drives me insane juz thinkin abt it..  I JUZ MISS HIM SO MUCH...   Imagine tis: Juz a day b4 it happened, we were out together.. Stil remb e time in e train.. id snuggled up to him,he hugged me, kissed me on e cheek n whispered ' i missed u' in my ear.. n e rest of e nite was perfect as well.. n suddenly, e next day, he's gone.. how wud u feel if u were me huh ?? Til today, i still wonder.. bn cryin.. hopin.. but im lettin it go.. ill juz wait.. wait til i fade away......
