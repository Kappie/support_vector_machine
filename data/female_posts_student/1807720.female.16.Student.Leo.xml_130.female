It's so refreshing when you wake up and your blinded by the light.  Guess you could say I am a true Summer gal, though Summer is still far away.  I had like the strangest dream last night.  I guess I have been thinking about school too much.  I dreamt that every time the bell would ring for a class change, I forgot something so I would go back to my locker and then be late for the next class.  When I was going to Bio I walked through the Math wing and in my old class our Bio teacher was there and I remember her saying "Now see the reflection of the mirrors?"  I wasn't sure if that was the right class so I went upstairs where Bio is suppose to be, but no one was there.  So I went back down stairs to the Math wing.  Strange dream!  I've been thinking about Bio or School too much.  In fact, most of my dreams nowadays are based on school, Bio, or Chem.
