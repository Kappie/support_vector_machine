So, feel free to post these on your blogs, to mass e-mail them to people who might be praying for you, whatever you want to do. Perhaps people knowing where we will be will give them more focus for their prayers as they know when we will be travelling and such. Without further ado...OUR ITINERARY (based on the dates given...i think it might be subject to change, i dunno).  July 7: departure for India July 9-11: Delhi July 12-13: Haridwar (with day trip to Rishikesh on the 13th) July 14-15: Delhi (Agra Fort and Taj Mahal on the 15th) July 16: departure for Raxaul July 17-August 5: Raxaul August 5: leave from Raxaul August 7-10: Delhi (tour of Delhi on the 9th) August 10: spread the joy back home!!!!
