I think I was the only person besides Patrick who'd never been; everyone else had gone two years ago or four years ago or five years ago or  whatever.  There's this eccentric (but very cool) lady named Patsy who has a house outside of town and gives cooking classes, wherein you all show up for five hours and make  comida.  (That's "food," children. Study your Spanish!)   Avery woke me up early this morning so I could shower before we left - thanks, Avery. Patsy showed up at the front door at 9:45, and we took two cars out to her house, which we probably never would have found without her. She's got two houses, actually, but she rents out the old one and lives in the newer one. Neither are big, but the newer is approximately 75% kitchen, which makes it suitable for giving cooking lessons in. I suppose that was the point.   At any rate, we got there and immediately got our hands dirty, preparing to make roasted pork, tamales, Aztec pie, chips, and chocolate chip cookies. I'd never heard of Aztec pie before today, but it's pretty much thus: Take everything you'd ever want to put on a tortilla chip. Layer it. Throw some whipped cream (not the sweet kind!) on top. And that's an Aztec pie. We're talkin' beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese, and all that jazz.   So we started cooking! We did everything from shucking the corn to shredding the chicken to roasting the peppers to frying the chips to grinding the tomatoes to dicing the onions to blending the tamale paste to  feeding the chickens!  OK, it wasn't entirely relevent, but still. I got to feed the chickens!  Patsy had chickens. Lots and lots of chickens. I'd say there were forty or so. There was a pen for them, but I guess that was just for at night, cuz they ran around all over the place most of the time. They lay eggs that she cooks with, and she feeds them all the food scraps (like corncobs and stuff). I got to take the bucket out there and dump it in the pen for all the chickens to eat. Heee! Chickens! I love the chickens!   Anyway, we cooked for, like...four hours. We also went n' saw her old house, but Avery and I didn't stay long, cuz it was small and Avery had been there before. But our main entertainment (when we weren't preparing something) was flywatching.   Patsy said that flies always proliferate before it rains. Well, I suppose she was right, because there were flies all  over  her kitchen. We're talking by the dozens. They'd land on anything they could, but if there was no real food out, they'd go for the two little plates of bait she had out...It was a combination of water and Snip, the stuff you rub on horses to keep the flies off. It works really fast, and it was extremely amusing to watch the flies die. They'd land, take a sip or two, walk around--then just freeze. Usually they'd fall over dead a few seconds after that, but some put on a show. This one fly - we called him Superfly - stayed alive for a good two minutes after eating the Snip, spasming and trying to buzz away. This other guy, the Spinner, spun around  insanely  fast for the longest time before dropping dead. Like, think of how fast a fly flies...then imagine one all spazzy so that it tried to fly with one wing and just keep going in circles. That's how fast he was spinning. Bet he got dizzy.   (Look, people, you had to be there...)  Anyway, we cooked n' cooked n' watched flies die n' cooked n' cooked and  finally  all the food was ready. We ate...and ate...and sat outside and talked...and ate. And it was good.  Los tamales son muy buenos!  (Or is it  las tamales son muy buenas?  *sigh* That's the problem with Spanish - everything has sex.)   But eventually we got done eating, and packed up the rest to take home. It was great fun. Lots of work, but great fun. Besides, it's  cooking,  which is always rewarding. You get food! Who can resist food, eh? Not me, that's for sure!
