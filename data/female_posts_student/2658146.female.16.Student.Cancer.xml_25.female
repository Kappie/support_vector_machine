She's living with her sister, who lives in the middle of Southern Missouri (a little town called Dora, if you want to know, and the whole town is basically Roy's Store (which is like a hick version of CFM) and some gas station). My grandmother lives there too. The drive down there is four hours (three and a half if Pa is driving). My aunt has become a grandmother herself. Her grandson is still in ICU though. He was a premie (sp?). He's six and a half weeks old now. He's almost three pounds, and the hospital plans to keep him for about another five and a half weeks. But back to the point I have yet to really get to. I learned a few things on my visit.  First of all, I learned what gives guys their distinct guy smell. It's the shampoo. If you use it, the scent will not go away, even if your life depends on it. I walked around for three days smelling like dude. It wasn't that bad, I like the smell of guys with good hygene. I wish girls' shampoo was that potent. Suave makes some damn good smelling stuff, but it doesn't last. The smell goes away as soon as I rinse the shampoo out of my hair. But for some reason, Suave for Men sticks to you.  Second, I have a really hot cousin. I would pay good money to do him. He is the sex god of the fluffy bunnies. The best of both of my guy worlds. But dammit, he's my cousin. The world hates me! I guess it's kindof a good thing though, he smokes, and me and cigarettes don't mix very well.  Third, I can take a lot more pain than I thought I could. I got some bad sunburn when I went floating with my aunt Mary, Mum, Zack, uncle Dean, aunt Nancy, Trent (the hot cousin), and Kelly (Trent's friend, I think she's his girlfriend, lucky duck, I envy her). When I got home, I took a hot shower. I knew it would sting. And it did. Like a bitch. But I didn't cringe and whine like I normally do. I'm getting tougher. Maybe. I dunno. It was just one of those weird things.  Fourth, my mother STILL has no consideration for others. Or at least me. I nearly choked to death on the float trip and the car ride from Dora to Rolla (roughly a two hour ride). On the float trip, she  had  to sit in the front of the boat and I  had  to sit behind her and tempt myself to tip the canoe so the ones she had left (along with the ones she was smoking) would be ruined. Again, the world hates me.  Fifth, I did a lot of thinking while I was away. It was one of the few things to do. I thought a lot about God. I prayed a lot too. And I questioned my beliefs. I realize that I was more secure as a Pagan. I didn't fear as many things as I do now. I wasn't so paranoid and insecure as I am now. I'm a nervous wreck now. The afterlife scares me. Sometimes I almost wish I was Pagan again, just so I would be so afraid. And I hate Christians. I can't get much more hypocritical. Well, sortof. I hate them because they try to force their beliefs onto other people (mostly the Protestants more often than Catholics). I hate people like that. They're the reason homosexual people can't marry. They're the ones who thought AIDS was a gay disease (morons). They're the reason we're at "war" in Iraq when we should actually be in Afghanistan. And I hate Europeans and Americans. I hate the latter more. I read a book,  Searching for Booger County  (which is a book on the history of Douglas County), and I found out that after the U.S. gained its independence from Britain, it had 45 treaties with one band of Native Americans, and it didn't keep one of them. FOURTY-FIVE! We're such selfish greedy pigs.  Sixth, I came to a conclusion. AIDS was God's way of controlling the human population. We have overcome every one of our problems as the human species with science. We don't adapt to anything anymore. We make the world adapt to us. And, we can't fix AIDS with science. First He targeted the gays. I don't have anything against them, but apparently He does. And now He is going after the whores, pimps, bastards, rapists, teenagers, and druggies. He used human's ignorance to the disease to his advantage and spread it around the world to the point to where we couldn't control the spread once we found out what it was and what it did. And he was successful. I give thanks to God for giving humans this incurable atrocity. He has done well, and will rid the earth of a lot of stupid people. Unfortunately this disease has a long incubation period, so it takes a while to kill everyone off. But at least this lets it spread without anyone knowing. God is a mastermind, and for this calamity I give Him eternal praise. I think this is his best miracle to date. Well, except maybe with the Virgin Mary and all. So this is his second best miracle. It's still good.  That was quite a mouthful. I feel cleansed now. Maybe I'll go have a cookie.   Current Mood:  Not really sure
