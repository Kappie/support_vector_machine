Strong woman can not be dominated, and men feel it is their place to dominate women. Why do they feel this way? Well, we all know it's from centuries of women being repressed, so I am not going to get into the characteristics of gender inequality right now. That's not really my point. What I am simply trying to find out is this: Do men prefer dating/marrying ditzes? Is the dumb blonde the ideal wife for a man? When a woman challenges a man intellectually do they really feel emasculated?  I'm tempted to try an experiment, and act like a ditz. I'm curious to see what the results of this would be. What type of men would I attract? How would I be treated? Better or worse, then now?  Not that it can really get any worse then now. As of right now, I'm not getting anywhere. Just my heart being crushed over and over again.   So, I guess, basically, I'm just wondering why it so hard for an intelligent girl to find a good man?
