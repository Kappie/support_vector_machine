I know it's been a while since I've updated...so here's what's been going on with me: -I've been taking lots of photos. -Worked on school stuff. -Went to town with Laura one day, my mom another. -I can't think of anything else.  Yep. That's it. I could finish talking about my vacation, but I dunno. We shall see.
