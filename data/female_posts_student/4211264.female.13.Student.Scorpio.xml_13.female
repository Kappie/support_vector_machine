Hannah, my "little" sister is watching TV as usual. In all of my other entrys from now on I will say if Hannah is watching TV or not, just to let you know how much she does. I am glancing back and forth from the computer to the show  Seventh Heaven , after I gave it a chance, it wasn't that bad suprisingly enough. I sort of like Seventh Heaven. I like Ruthie the best, the little girl. I have to go now, and go to McDonalds on the bus, because I love the bus. Buy.  -Sierra
