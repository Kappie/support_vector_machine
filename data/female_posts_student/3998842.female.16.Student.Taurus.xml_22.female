Call me sweetheart. Hold me through the night I’ll stare into the Blue lights and pray for eternity. In love Not with you not with her. With a kiss. With a touch. With a scream. Too quiet. Too out. Too much to handle. I’m sorry, baby You’ll say. I just don’t need you anymore. You’re body, it just don’t work for me no more. A kiss. One last kiss. A ring returned by a reluctant friend. Tears on pavement. Can’t live without you. Don’t leave me. A call. A truth. A lie. I’m sorry, baby You’ll say. I’m sorry. I’ll beg. ~ In love Not with you not with her. With the rain With the pain With the complication. Only happy when it rains, it’s not you I want. I’m simply in love  with being in love. With a kiss With a touch but mostly,  with a memory.      ~fin~
