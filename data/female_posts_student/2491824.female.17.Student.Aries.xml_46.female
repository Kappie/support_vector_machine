Yay!!!.... :/  But, it'll be fun once we get there! ...And we're going to have dinner at the Olive Garden tomorrow night. It's one of my favorite restaurants. Yay. :) ..The only drawback to everything is that I have to dress nice on Tuesday. Bah.  But I found some nice black dress pants tonight that I look pretty good in. Yay! ...I know, me finding me pants that I like... It's amazing...  The pool party was alright. Outside of us volunteering there, there were few people there over the age of 12.  We made a decent amount of money though. Craig said we made about $200(?) at the door. Not too bad, I suppose...   Teoti  is down.  I'm bored.
