Not an easy accomplishment for someone who seems always to have   something   to say.  Of course, since anyone without opinions about something probably wouldn't even     think     of creating a blog.  I could be wrong about that.    It may be noticed that the title of this blog is a little off.  Apparently, the delete key or the delete finger (can't be sure which) was inoperable.  I was told that "What do I know?" couldn't be used, though no reason was given.  I obviously attempted to change it to "What do We know?", and failed.  And this is what I'm left with
