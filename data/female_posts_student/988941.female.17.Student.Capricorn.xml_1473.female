So I spent most of the day on a til of some sort and encountered some very very rude people. I got to throw 3 kids out of the store who then spent most of the morning shouting abuse at me.  I can't believe that though. I don't mind working at Woolies but we get abused by hooligans outside and then nick stuff and the other day they threw flour all over our stocking area out the back. Idiots. They are pathetic but cause so many problems for us.  Something is being done. We had petition going for cameras outside all the shops. I believe there is a meeting next week at like 8 in the morning for shop runners to talk about geting better security and stuff.  Its outrageous though it really is.
