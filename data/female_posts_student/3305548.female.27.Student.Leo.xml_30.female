My first homework deadline was yesterday (met with grace and speed) and it seems that we were just running around ALL DAY yesterday. We went grocery shoppping with the Bear In-Laws over across the river in Ohio. Giant Eagle beckoned and we regressed. There we were sneaking items into the shopping cart while no one was looking. *sneak sneak* Just like little kids. When the cart was getting unloaded it was a chant of "it was on sale," or "we really need that," or "you have to try this - you will love it!" Sad but true. My husbands mom was glad to have extra hands to cover her giant grocery trip but might have wished we werent there to toss more into the carts.   We also both went the YMCA and worked out, and are doing so again today!!! Yay us. We desperately need the exercise to say the least. Especially me...  Today was a YMCA work/cleanup day. I spent the morning helping to assemble and arrange two computers in the Afterschool Room area with another counselor. And they say my hubby is the computer genius...I got the internet up and running and everything!  Bina - my gather-er of info extrordinairre has brought up to me the booty blogging that was going on from the perspective of an intern for the state of Ohio. Her alias was Washingtonienne or something along those lines...and she was fired for the contents of her blog. Note to self: DONT BLOG BOOTY. Especially if that booty involves government officials...  Ah, and another serious terrorist threat against the US. Who is to say we dont have it coming? Thanks to our useless invasions left and right and our human rights atrocities we have, in some ways, earned it. Now, mind you the average joe in the street doesnt deserve to be attacked by a terrorist (except maybe because they didnt vote 4 years ago!!!) But seriously - no "innocents" deserve to die for the poor leadership of our country. On the other hand, our country has been killing innocents in the name of misguided military campaigns for a couple years now...Afghanistan/Iraq...and really I dont consider that much different than terrorists. Just because our military is funded by our government, and led by our government who have their own agenda regardless of the voters wishes...oh wait, how is that not terrorism???  Oh my, I have to go for now. The limitations of owning one vehicle in a non walking and non biking friendly town with no true public transportation is very frustrating.  --Mack
