This thing can shred 20+ pages in one pull and is capable of shredding staples.  You read that correctly, it shreds metal!  I think that Metal Shredders would be a great name for a band, by the way.    I’m not sure why I’m so fascinated by the brawn of the PowerShred 220, but I just keep looking for things to destroy.  At first, I thought that the 220 meant horsepower, but after remembering what the horsepower on an average four-cylinder car is, I decided that the shredder isn’t quite that powerful.  It’s probably volts.  But still, so impressive!  I accidentally dropped a paper clip in it earlier, and I was sure that the fun was over, that it would self-destruct before my eyes, but it actually seemed to enjoy the challenge.   I stopped short of “accidentally” dropping anything larger in, out of fear that I would anger the beast, or my boss.  Note to any co-workers who read this:  I’m really not dropping random things in the paper shredder.    I think if in 1985 the Russians had possessed the paper shredding technology that the U.S.D.A. has now, we would all be in line for day-old bread in front of a giant statue of Joseph Stalin.
