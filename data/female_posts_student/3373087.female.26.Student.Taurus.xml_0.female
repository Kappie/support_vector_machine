Acutally, I think the hardest time will be the next 2 weeks or so since we need to readjust to not seeing eachother again. The thought of spending 7 weeks in Boston will be one of the few things that will keep me going. As B put it, this was the best Memorial Day weekend of my entire life. I wouldn't change anything about the time we spent together, but such a wonderful weekend necessarily makes this temporary separation even harder.    All of the apprehension that I felt just prior to his arrival immediately went away when I picked him up at the airport. Spending time with him is so  easy .  All weekend I scarcely felt like I was with a different person.  I know this sounds strange, but it was almost like our thoughts were so similar that it was like talking to ME.  I just feel like we understand eachother in a fundamental way, even though our expereinces are different.  There were many occasions when he would say something that sounded exactly like something that I would say.    We had some really good conversations about our future, the conflicts we've had, our differences, about people, about our spiritual growth and discipline, and much more.  I think my most vivid memories will be of the times that we spent sitting by the pond in the gazebo.
