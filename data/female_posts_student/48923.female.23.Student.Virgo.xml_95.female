Thanks, The Girl who seems to attract crazy men like gas guzzling cars attract americans.  --  Whilst attempting to parallel park in the ex-FratBoy neighborhood, an old african american man comes between my car and the place i wanted my car to be.  Slowly shouting: D-O  Y-O-U  S-P-E-A-K  E-N-G-L-I-S-H? I was in the parallel parking zone, so i was puzzled by what he was saying and its relevance to his body being in the way of my parking car. D-O  Y-O-U  S-P-E-A-K  E-N-G-L-I-S-H? I'm in one of the whitest american good-ole-boys neighborhood around  and i wish i could pass for a nationality other than american.  wanting him to to move out of my way, i mumble "yes" slightly fearful of what a "no" would produce. cue sob story.  cue sob story that sounded familar to the sob story of the men up in midway who wanted enough money for a bus ticket to the VA hospital, but it was slightly different it involved a different hospital. C-A-N  Y-O-U  T-R-U-S-T  M-E? C-A-N  Y-O-U  G-I-V-E  M-E  M-O-N-E-Y? does he realize that my car brings down the property value of cars around it? does he realize the slower he talks and is obstructing my spot the more i desire to run him over?
