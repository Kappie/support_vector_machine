Saturday:  Got up, went to the lake with Kt + Kathe + Kathe's friend. Sat in the sun. Baked. Kayaking. Avoiding fishes. Came home. Went over to my house. Stayed up all night online. Fell asleep.  Sunday:  Went to Kt's Nana's. Swam. Watched SCARY MOVIE 3 + I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU NOT. Some Claire Danes   Monday: Went home about 11. Studied for finals.   This  week will be eventless. As far as I can tell. But soon enough it will be Thursday. And that is the last day of school. Friday I will leave to Bako. I'm trying to get Kt to come with me. Hella sick fukka. Yuh man.    I let MTV brainwash me today + I came away with wanting to buy the new Janet Jackson album.    I'm peacin homes.  Elyse
