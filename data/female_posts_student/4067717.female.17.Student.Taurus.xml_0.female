Not to mention I got to see her new puppy! Chloe is a labrador/pit bull mix and she's soooo cute!  In other news, saw 'Eddie' tonight. Sarah, have you looked up a picture of Luke Mably yet? Anyway, as usual, I was too shy/tongue-tied/much of a loser to say anything, so it was basically a walk-past with no eye contact thing. *sigh* Must learn how to flirt...  I just watched 'The Quick and the Dead' on TBS. Horrible movie, made worse by the fact that it had potential, but still entertaining. Russell Crowe is hot. That reminds me, I need to see 'Gladiator.' I've heard it's good, though historically inaccurate.  Mom's at work, so I know she'll be in a bad mood when she gets home. Oh, here she comes now! Dad and I both think she'll be putting in her two weeks' notice soon. Heh, heh, heh. What else was I going to say?  Oh! You wanted to know who barrydublin is? I really don't know. I found his blog while looking at random entries on the 'most recently published' list and thought it was hysterical. You can't understand a word he's saying, as it's all written in what I think is supposed to be Irish slang. But there are some interesting pictures.  Tiffany and Nicolee are camping tonight and tomorrow night at Kanopolis. I'm not, because Mom was being OVERPROTECTIVE as usual. She thinks I would have fallen into the lake. *rolls eyes*  Perhaps I'll wait till  after  I turn 18 to tell her about the cruise...   'Cause I'm broken   When I'm lonesome   And I don't feel right   When you're gone away  AWESOME SONG: "Broken" by Seether with Amy Lee
