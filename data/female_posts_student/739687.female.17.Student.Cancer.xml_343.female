That'll be interesting.  This past Saturday = no bueno. Shauna got sick...from...well, u know. What else.  Today I went and got sushi, and then went tanning, picked up my paycheck and blah.  I'm at my final little push...2 more weeks and I can just chill out for a while. Sort of.  All these AP tests are just the most stressful thing ever.  But otherwise, everything seems to be running fairly smoothly.  Oh, except work is gay.  Haha, alright that's all for now.  Keep on movin' crazies.
