During the thunder, lightning and the buckets of rain, I was driving in Everett. I was so excited. I opened my windows and everytime it lightninged (That doesn't sound right...meh) I would get all excited. There was a river of water flowing to my right near the sidewalk. I wanted to play in it so bad! I love hard rain. I wish it did that more often.       Well, I've gota an hour before I have to go to bed...Stupid work. LATERz      ~Bayz
