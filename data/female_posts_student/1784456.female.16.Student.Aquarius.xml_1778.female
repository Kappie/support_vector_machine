Woo, GO KATIE! cant wait til tomoz lunch, i love pizza! but i dunno whot to wear, whether to wear my little black dress which i have worn yet or wear the stuff i wore to my aunties wedding or something entirely different again! Will decide when i see the weather tomorrow! I have finally figured out why it is i have been so miserable recently. I was supposed to be going on hols with samantha and claire and emmy, but then our plans fell thru for a number of reasons. the theory only came to me yesterday when my dad decided that i was invisible and he could just talk to liam, who i ws trying to talk to, over me. and thats it, when i am with my friedns i can get myself heard cos i have more power over you lot than i do with my family, and i am more at ease with u lot, and thats wot i missed. i wanted to be able to have the power for a whileand i just wnted to be away from my parents so that i had control over my own life for a while am alot happier now that i hv realised this but i wud have prefered to hv realised it earlier!
