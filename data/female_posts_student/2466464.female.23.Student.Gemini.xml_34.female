PRINCESS or DIVA or CUTIE or QUEEN  ... i feel however that PRINCESS embodies all of the other possibilities so that would probably be my pick   #4 ... have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? what did the inscription say?  thank god i have not received such things, odds say i would've thrown it back in their face whoever it might have been ... except mother of course, i'm afraid of her   #5 ... what would you like your epitaph to be?   epitaph? what's that? ... hold on, got to run to merriam-webster.com be right back ... ok got it, good ...
