For less than $80 (79.95 to be exact), the  urlLink Logitech X-530 Speakers  provide 5.1 surround sound with rich balanced sound and minimized distortion.  They may not be as powerful as the Klipsch set,  but they look deceptively high-end.  The X-530, and its cheaper 2.1 cousin, the X-230 (49.95) will be available from  urlLink Logitech  later this month.
