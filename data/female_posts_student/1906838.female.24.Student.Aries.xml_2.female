Aliens land in America. UFO's are sighted in America. and in the 'day after tomorrow', Americans are the first to suffer from the climatic shift which would subsequently bring the world into the New Ice Age. hmmm.. i suppose, we should thank our lucky stars for that ...  oh well. at least the acting in this movie was so much better compared to that in TROY, in which only Peter O'Toole's acting as the old King of Sparta, land of the Trojans, was worthy enough of being called 'good acting'. Btw , i only recently found out after watching TROY that one of the actors ( Brian Cox) is dundonian. how cool is that???!  anyways, i have my own 'disaster' the day after tomorow.. well, i wouldnt actually call it a disaster .. more like a sad event lah .. oh well, we cant expect everyday to be a happy day, can we?
