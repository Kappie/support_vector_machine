I am so used to having him home all the time, that when he is gone it feels like there is a part of me gone.  I was thinking about him, wondering how he is doing and what he is doing.  I worry about him, but I know that God would not want me to worry.  Everything is in God's hands.  I was thought that life wasn't worth living, but then with my life now I realize there is so much to live for.  I have a man whom I have loved for half my lifetime (yes there where times I didn't love him very much, but those were in moments of miscommunications and immaturity.), I have three very intelligent and beautiful children, I have a family closer to me then I could ever imagine and I have a handful of friends who love me inspite of my flaws and shortcomings.  I am so thankful to God for my blessings.  Oh and I think that I did well on my interview, so please just keep your fingers crossed for me.  I really want this job and I really think I could make this work for me.  I better get to bed, my mind seems to be going a million miles a minute...
