She was there for me with the whole Ryan thing. She was there for me that awful day that that man tried to get me in his car and she was there when I needed to talk about family problems. I miss her, but she's moved away. She moved to Ohio and she's back in IL now, but...not close enough to spend time with. I think we've probably grown apart by now anyway, but I miss her. and the way she was always, no matter what, there for me. She was one of the truest friends I ever had. I know she doesn't read this, but thanks Christy. You were a great friend.
