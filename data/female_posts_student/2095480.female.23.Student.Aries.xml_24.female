Not really sure where to start... oh yeah... how about when I got up? I woke up feeling like a new person. Looking back on previous blog essays, I must have been in total PMS mode or something... or maybe now I have just now caught up with sleep, therefore causing me to feel like a new person.  Today was amazing. I just did little normal Sunday things, but for the first time in a long time, I was happy about it.  Maybe it has something to do with rest, sunshine, rest, having a cat to play with... no... thats not it. REST. Yup, that is the reason I feel renewed. This was the first weekend that I had absolutely no demands placed upon me...so all I did was sleep. Seems elementary enough.  I just feel like turning on the radio (more likely a chosen CD) and just singing at the top of my lungs... (Be glad you are reading this, not watching this!)   I think that is just what I will do.
