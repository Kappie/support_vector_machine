It gets muddied up in my mind after a while since so much of it sounds the same, but some tracks are absolutely memorable.   Finals aren't that bad now once that English and Spanish and Math are over with. It was so weird looking at that math final again, knowing that it screwed me over the last time. I don't know what to make of the fact that had I messed up on one less problem over the summer, I'd be in Calculus right now, but that's no matter. It's over with, and plus, that's too super geek for the rest of the world so I might as well can it.  Erum's on a plane to Saudi Arabia right now, to do the hajj, or the pilgrimage or something. It's just amazing that the girl who's always stressing about school (along with everyone else) in an Aeropostale sweatshirt across from me in English is going to that legendary black box to walk around, to perform the steps.   More and more I realize what a wallflower I am. I'm not going to change anything now since fundamentally, being antisocial feels right, but it's just kind of strange when you're sitting there and everyone has someone else to talk to and you're just bent over a book trying to make like you have something better to do. But self-pity is an evil thing.
