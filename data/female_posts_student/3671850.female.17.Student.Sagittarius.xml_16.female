After we ate in Clemson, *note to self: there are NO good restaurants in Clemson* we went to Hallmark where we almost had a wreck with a cute college boy.  My mom was backing up and didnt see him, he yelled, I called him a Jackass and then my mom apoligized.. and he totally changed his attitude... interesting, eh?  When I got home I watched hours of MTV, played with Morgan, worked out, and ate jelly beans... hmm kinda defeats the whole work out, huh?  Anyway, tomorrow is the LAST DAY OF SUMMER... nooooooo!!! This cannot be happening.  I'm now depressed. :( tear*  Okay, I'm over it.  I am a little excited to see my friends, and force Chad to talk to me... waaaa haaa haaa, my evil plan, lol.  I completely  crashed  at about 8:00 but then I woke up at 10:00 and now I'm sooo awake, I hate that.  Oh yea!!! I almost had a wreck today too, imagine that.  I had a yeild sign but the lady who was turning drove like 10ft into my lane, hello??  A yeild sign doesn't mean i should have to back up for you to turn.  Who are these  stupid  drivers... I want to know!  Song of the Day: Slow Motion  by Juvenile... only because it came on TV sooo much I have it stuck in my head.  I hate that song. pew.
