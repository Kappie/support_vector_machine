I keep wondering what I'm doing exactly, has there been a point to all this? My life, I mean. I really should stop feeling sorry for myself, it doesn't really help anything. I've got dinner with Alice tomorrow night then a little birthday party Thursday afternoon. Fun, right? Should be...  About an hour ago I drank an entire pot of coffee and then went out in the dark to powerwash my house. My mum thinks I'm an idiot and I think one of my neighbors may have called the police. Did I mention this was an industrial strength powerwasher? Very, very loud. So that probably wasn't one of my best idea's. I was supposed to do that this morning but I was too busy sleeping. I'm re-painting a section of our house, the toolshed, and the shop this weekend. I hate painting buildings so my parents have decided this is entirely my job. Thanks mucho parental units...  One of my neighbors lost his dog a few days ago. He is, of course, very upset. I understand completely. That did not give him the right to accuse me though. No wait, not me, the "syphilitic gang of rabbits" I unleashed on our neighborhood is what apparently abducted and murdered his dog. I kid you not. First of all, what the fuck? Second, I have TWO rabbits, they are fixed, live in my house, and do not have syphilis. What's more, they're RABBITS, I don't think they're capable of killing a 120Lb dog or "abducting" one for that matter. This guy may be more insane then I am. I think we should be best friends...  Oh hold on here, my mum just made me another pot of coffee. Lady, you don't know what you're getting yourself into. I'm going to drink it and run around outside for a few hours. :)
