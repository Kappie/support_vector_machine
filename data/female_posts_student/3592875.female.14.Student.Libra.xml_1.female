I finally fell asleep around 4:30.  and woke up around 6:00.  one comment just ruined my whole night/day.  am I being to emotional?  should I not let boys get to me?  I think I should just forget them all together.  as friends.  as anything more.  girls to.  I haven't had much luck in the friend department this year.  well I guess I never have.  hmm.    All I want is someone real, someone to hold the candle with me, let the nightfires burn, its not what i choose, its what i feel, and if we don't see eye to eye you go your way I'll go mine and that's alright.   So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away. The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay.Understand its in your hand to turn the other way, and make tomorrow the first day.   A persons love, a starry night, all wonderful but not as grand as the man who chooses life and we compete in word and deed, you'd think we learn by now, its not what people need but that's our style.  So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away. The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay. Understand its in your hand to turn the other way, and make tomorrow the first day.   Birds take to the sky, we open our eyes, your saying hello, I'm waving goodbye...To the old days.
