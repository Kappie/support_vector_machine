(yes the tires were flat) and james met me like half way cause he thought that i was mad at him and i thought that that was the sweetest thing ever. in the end, this weekend didn't seem so cool after all.  so i ended up not going to school today because i needed to recover from this weekend, it wasn't that i was so burnt out more than damaged emotionally. to much of me seeing one person for one weekend. (most of you probably know who i am talking about) it's sad that it still gets to me everytime i see him. i mean he didn't even talk to me, but i still get upset over it. my mom took notice to something i didn't, he called me. at 6:30 yesterday, and im scared to find out why, REALLY scared. im sure its nothing important but still. i can't take this anymore, i just can't. i need to get out of this town. i need to get out and stay out. and im thinking there is a way i can get out, and make this happen. but i don't know if i really should or not. what if i end up actually missing this place. what happens if i actually do go to rehab and end up missing everyone, all the people that have dicked me over, and all the people that have ditched me for their boyfriends or their other friends. all the people that call themselves my friends who actually in all reality can go suck a cock cause they're not my friends at all. i don't have any friends, none here at least.   i don't know what i see in people sometimes, maybe i think that they're worth getting to know, but then i second guess myself because people aren't worth getting to know if they keep ditching you day after day. they're not worth getting to know if all they do is wanna waste there life away and not get anywhere. half my friends are probably going to end up going no where in life, i don't want to be friends with people like that. i want my friends to actually have goals in life like i do. i don't want friends who are just going to smoke for the rest of their lives. that's not what i want. and that's where im going to be heading if i don't change my life around. but the hard thing is, i have no friends that are supporting me. i have no friends that don't smoke. i used have dannyk but no she smokes now. i don't have any of my preppy friends to turn to because they are all smoking now too. there is no one left, everyone smokes now. do you know how hard it is not to smoke when all of your friends do it? it's horrible. i can't stand it. a part of me wants to stop smoking soo bad because smoking sometimes is just so stupid, it won't get you anywhere in life, it's not helping you out in anyway. but then when everyone smokes i just think, fuck it, why not smoke? it makes you feel good, it helps make the times fun, and its not like you're doing it alone. so i don't know what to do. there are two very good arguments. but what am i to do. yah know, im going to start hanging out with danny more, she is the only true friend i have left, yes i know that is sad, because dannyk has been the only person in my life that has stuck through it with me through the whole 3 years of my fucked up stages in my life. she has been there whenever i needed someone. and she still is my one  only.  everything has been changing, these past couple of years have been crazy for me, they have changed so much it's been insane. i never thought that i would lose almost all of my friends because of breaking up with someone. who knew that could have happened, who could have known. not me. and now that when im around those same people it's so akward. there's nothing to say. nothing to talk about. we're different people then we were two years ago. things change, people change. no one stays the same. that's just not how life works, we go through new expeiriences, and get to know different people. and we change because of those life expieriences, and those people that we meet. we all just change. maybe for the worse maybe for the best. we all just change, and maybe thats a good thing. right now i think its a bad thing, because im left out. im forgotten about. but maybe that was how things were meant to be. maybe i wasn't meant to be happy. this isn't an entry for me to get pitty for, it's an entry explaining the truth, about how i feel and how i have felt these last 3 years. these last 3 years have been the craziest 3 years of my life. these last 3 years have probably been crazy for a lot of people. it was when we were all introduced to pot, to sex, drugs, music, everything. all at once. and we all just stood there and took it in. some took it in more than others and are definately worse off like me. i wanted to try everything and listen to everything and be everything, and i burnt out to fast. so that's where i am now. burnt out and wise beyond my years, meaning i understand what it's like to want to die. i understand what it's like to have problems. i understand what it's like to have a drug problem, i understand what it's like to know the only reason your relationship with the love of your life broke up was because you had an untreated illness. and it's not like because im pshyco, but because i understand. and that's hard for people to interperate, they automatically think you're pshyco if you know what it's like to have issues. well you're wrong. im not pshyco. im fuckin brittany  one day i will find someone who understands like i do. and that someone will be my special someone. he is my prince charming. and until i find him i just have to keep waiting, and be staying strong until he comes and finds me. all i know is that im not letting people step all over me anymore. thanks for listening guys.   *i've got a $20 bill that says  no one's ever seen you without  make up you're always made up*
