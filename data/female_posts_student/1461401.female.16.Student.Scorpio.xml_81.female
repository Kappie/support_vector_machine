Blood dripping from my hands. Into my eyes. I scream.  I wake up, panting. Dark clouds swirl before my eyes. I'm in my room. It was just a dream...but then, why is my little light on? I look around... everything seems normal. But then I look at my hands again. The blood. The blood is still there! Where could it have come from? I hear a moan, and my body freezes. Something, laying next to my bed on the floor. Oh god. What have I done? I look at him, his eye glazed over, gasping for one last breath. It's him. I... I killed him. I rub my eyes, smearing the blood into them. The more blood gets into my eyes, the more the vision fades. At last, it is all gone...  But not forgotten.
