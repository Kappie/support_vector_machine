So cute right? lols! if you're wondering who those guys are.. the first pic features the ever so popular  medwin  teng tw on the right and  shaun , who now looks entirely different with his copper red, spiky hair. in the 2nd pic.. again, shaun standing up, and  kenneth .   I had no idea how boys can change so much in sucha' short period of time. now i do.
