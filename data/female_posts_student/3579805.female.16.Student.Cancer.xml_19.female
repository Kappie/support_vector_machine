My mouth feels very strange. Im really supposed to have the house clean and be raking the leaves right now. I have yet to clean the house and the leaves remain unraked.I just need to get this crap done so when mom comes home i can go to the store them come back home and sleep. Oh and talk to sam. Thats rather important.lol god i need to do my chores....
