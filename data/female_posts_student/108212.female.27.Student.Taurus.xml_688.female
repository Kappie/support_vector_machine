For this event they want to sell some of the GREAT  urlLink gadgets  they had in the old studio.   urlLink CLICK HERE  to see the goodies they are selling.  In other news, this week, my beloved boss took is long awaited two week vacation.  And not a moment too soon!  The end of week one is here and I have improved the store greatly!  We've aquired the highest customer service rating in the region.  90.6% of those surveyed says we ROCK!  Mystery Shopper anyone?  We scored a perfect 100!  Who's you're daddy?  Whats left is to clean the house!  The powers that be are visiting the New York market, My boss "JaBa" and I will have to make sure the store is up to their standards.  I have to start by sweeping the mice away.  Got a couple of them who still arent playing my way.  But enough of myself.  This is a forum.    Change of topics....   urlLink WNEW  fired  urlLink OPIE and ANTHONY .  The two shock DJ's were fired for the dare they gave their listners to have Sex in St. Patricks Cathedral! Discuss....     more to come....  ~Net
