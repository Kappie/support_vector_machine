As part of the study he is looking for as many local residents as possible to take part in his research by filling in a survey about their views on where in the borough you think suffers from high crime. You can fill in the short questionnaire on line here  urlLink http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ap776/  or you can request a paper copy from the researcher ( urlLink k.m.cressy@city.ac.uk ) The deadline for taking part is the 15th August 2004 and I'm sure it will make very interesting reading - If you don't want to take part but are interested in the outcome you can look at the results so far here  urlLink http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ap776/applets/taggerQuery.htm?
