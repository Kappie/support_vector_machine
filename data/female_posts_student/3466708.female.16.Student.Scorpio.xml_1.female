That's not very exciting but I found the little dinky poetry section that they have and took out some books. I can't remember the names off the top of my head besides..Hunting with Hemmingway but yeah, hopefully there's some good literature there. A good read is hard to find and sometimes I do like to read things that actually make me think. Then again I also took out a few teen magazines..that doesn't exactly cause my brain to sweat. Heheh. I should hope not anyway eh? o_o  Wow my sister made chocolate mousse for dessert. That gal can cook! Well, I already knew that but still, she makes me proud. ^_^ I wubbish her so much. And not just 'cuz she makes good dessert. Meheh.  Morgan, Ash and I decided we should all live with her..well they decided to and I figured I had might as well follow. lol Good times to be had. Yeeeup.  A friend of my parents' is over. We've known her for almost 10 years now, real nice lady. She has kids the same age as my sisters and I and my dad is best friends with her ex hubby. So we all get along pretty well and whatnot. Anyways, I kinda enjoy..well I do enjoy..sitting with adults and just talking. Maybe that's weird, I don't know. I mean I like being around people of all ages but with adults you can carry on a more intelligent conversation and yeah..haha. I sound just SO damn cool. xD What am I trying to say? haha. Who really knows.   Hmm on the flip slide tho, I love hanging with my friends. Even if we're just doing fuck all it's still fun. We laugh a lot. I love to laugh. Everyone in the frikkin' world should laugh wayy more. Everyone would be so much happier. I mean, say you're in your local 7-11 and some guy is holding the place up and is all.."Give me all of your fucking money man before I shoot you!!" and everyone in the store just starts to laugh. Now, I wonder what the chances are that the dude with the gun would just start laughing as well, or would he just go ballistic and shoot everyone? Not really something I'm interested in finding out but hey, you've gotta wonder.  Actually you don't, I'm talking outta my white ass here. Whooeey. *Crazy signals*  I'm gonna watch LOTR 3 tonight. I saw it in theatres. Quite enjoyed it. I think that even if I didn't like the storyline all that much, which I do, but if I didn't..I would still enjoy the movie because I seriously think it was really well done. Lots of movies you watch 'em and think.."Wow this movie could be SO much better" but with LOTR I didn't think that. Sure there are parts that could have been cut out but I think that the directors were also showing respect to the author by trying to keep it going with the actual book. yanno? Anyways, a good movie IMO. Yup yup. Plus, hobbits are so cool. Haha. I wish we had hobbits..whoa ok shutting up now.  So I'm off now. Mooovie time. Whee. Fun with family. Hehe. Jk, gotta love 'em.   Stay tuned folks..tomorrow..a bio about..me! hah. Maybe. If I'm not lazy. ^_^  ciao. xox.
