She hurt her arm so I had to drive and we went to Taco Bell by some ghetto place and I started to go around the parking lot, and all of a sudden I hear this loud scratch and my moms priceless car is teteering on a 3ft fucking rock. Because my moms car is so freakin long and I couldn't see over that blind spot I didn't even notice the damn thing. First my mom says back up, then forward and I"m like HEY WE'RE NOT ON THE FUCKING GROUND IT DOESNT MATTER! Then all these Mexicans show up at start staring, perfect time for me to just cry and run away hidding my face lol. I get out of the car to see it cause my moms car was like..not able to open, and I see this huge rock and the whole step thing under her car door is completely smashed in and the paint is all fucked. Finally some guy just lifted it off of the rock and my mom just sat in the car asking me how bad it was over and over and I just got back in and we drove off. Some guy said it was AT LEAST 500 dollars worth of damage...shoot me now. Then I get to the grocery store and I'm paranoid about my dad and what he's gonna say about the car but my mom was totally care free like nothing happened and told me not to worry, which of course made me panic. We got to her house and my dad was about to pick me up and my mom called him beforehand to tell him about the car so we just hung out in the yard talking. He came over and looked all pissed and just kinda stared at me then my mom got kinda pissed for him being all mean. I was surprised he even let me drive his car back home lol and halfway there I asked him if anything else was on his mind cause he was so pissed and he mentioned he got my mom's mail for me and in it was, of course, the infamous report card. He pretty much told me my life is going to shit along with everything else then just dropped me off and left. So now I'm here after a long weekend of just being bitched at, wishing it was finally SUMMER!
