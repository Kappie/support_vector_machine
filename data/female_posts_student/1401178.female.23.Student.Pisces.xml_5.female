Believe me, I've came across some that's not into the category of enjoyable. Anyhoo, let's talk about the movie.  I saw  Lucky 7  on  urlLink Cinemax  just yesterday. I actually made some plan to watch it when I saw the synopses, because it sounds good. But I didn't watch it until yesterday, when I accidently flip around the channels and came across the movie.    The Story    Lucky 7  tells the story of Amy Myer ( urlLink Kimberly Williams ), a lawyer from Seattle. Amy's mom ( urlLink Gail O'Grady ) dies when she was 7. Before she dies, she left some kind of timeline (schedules, rules, bla bla bla, based on time). One of them is how to find the perfect husband. The rules (or guidelines) goes like this: the perfect man for perfect husband is lucky boyfriend number 7 (hence the title). From watching the movie, I found out that to determine wether he is a boyfriend or not is when the man announces that Amy is his girlfriend. One day, Amy meets this gorgeous and handsome man (so the synopses says) named Daniel ( urlLink Brad Rowe ) at a bagel store. Daniel is a handsome, succesful, and somewhat to be ideal man. But the glitch is...he's only boyfriend number 6. So...Amy cooks up a scheme to make Daniel the lucky number 7. Fortunately for Amy, she has found the pseudo-number-six man. His name is Peter Connor ( urlLink Patrick Dempsey ), the man who work at the bagel store. Also fortunately for Amy, Peter also has a scheme. He was invited by his old friend to their wedding. And...he needs a pseudo girlfriend to prove to his golddigging ex that he's over her. So they goes to the wedding and pretend they are happy couple. But here's where the problem starts...they actually fall in love. So...will Amy follows her heart or her mother timeline? Well, guess. Nah, just kidding. The movie ends with happy note (you know what I mean).    The Review   I just like this movie. It's a remake of an old classic (or so say the  urlLink Cinemax  site). It's also a very enjoyable romantic comedy. I would give it a B+ (the plus is for  urlLink Patrick Dempsey  - he's totally cute in it, not like when he plays the NYC mayor's son in  urlLink  Sweet Home Alabama  . Totally better).
