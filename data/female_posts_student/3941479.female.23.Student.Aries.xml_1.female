Well no not really, I've sucessfully completed all fo theabove todayflippin fantastic. Oh well I'm stillsmiling so it can't be that bad right?I actually had a decent day at work today,kids seemed reasonably happy and were pretty good at following instructions which isn't a usual occurance for the great afterschoolcrowd, maybe they'd been blasted by thier teachers or something I don't know.     Anyhow life goes on, nothing much else to report today :)
