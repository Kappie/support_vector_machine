Perhaps after this evening I will finally have my closure from neurotic figure skaters.  I would enjoy that... and there's free pizza and bars, I can handle that.    I went on a dairy binge last night... I had about 6 chocolate Oreos.  I'm such a disappointment.  *sob*  Walk like a North Dakotan,  Manda
