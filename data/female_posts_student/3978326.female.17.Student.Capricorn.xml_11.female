Fifth Form was quite hellish for me and some of my friends who wanted a guarenteed results of nothing but a unsploit string of gleaming A's. This might seem like an easy enough wish. Just add a table spoon of hard work, a pint of sweat, a drop of blood, a kilogram of sacrifice, a pinch of heart break with many failures in not obtaining A's in trial exams, and well....bits and pieces here and there that comes along the way.  Certainly, the sum of it all (being scalar quantities) proved to be quite an overwhelming amount. The price? Our SANITY!  And prove ?  After physics, we returned to our class room and started chatting.  "Hey, what's Hooke's law again?" "The force applied is proportional to the extension of an elastic body until the elastic limit is reached," "Wei, don't give such ambiguous descriptions to me! What's the elastic limit thing?" "The maximum stress that can be applied on a elastic body after which it will not return to it's original size once the strees is removed....." "HEY, it's easier to remember it this way!" "And, what's your master plan?" "Hooke's Law, it's applicable to virtually any body, where the extension is proportional to the force right?" "Yes, where are you getting at? I recognise that smile Elaine" "Apply it to the penis"...  Needless to say, our minds went into a brief moment where we tried to stimulate the actual case in which this law could be applicable, and it left us in a high and delirious mood for the rest of the day. I even snorted during Additional Maths ( a subject in which the look in the teachers face would tell you, any form of noise was not acceptable ).  Carrying on the tradition of my class, I'm passing this around.  P.S - Just learnt about Deformation of Solids today....don't try this at home!
