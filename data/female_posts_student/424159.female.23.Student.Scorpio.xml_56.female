The Ovoid thing is so adorable, which is why he's the background for every page!  Life update:  Well, Monday starts the third week of clinicals at Childrens.  It's pretty cool there (its a really nice hospital) and I'll hopefully get my ped chest comped soon.  I can't really think of anything else important, so....until next time.
