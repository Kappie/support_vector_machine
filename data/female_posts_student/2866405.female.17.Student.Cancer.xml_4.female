I REMEMBER  I remember the very first day I came to school with last years year 12’s gone. Our spot felt so empty. After a few shed tears I took a look around at the graffiti they left behind and thought the year through. I remember when Leigh and Gene wrote a song about Muniur to the tune of an old Tupac song and how we made them sing it over and over till we were almost in tears of laughter. I remember the day me  john were trying to light our cigarettes. It was windy and the flame wouldn’t light. Everyone was screaming our name, we were ignoring them because we just wanted to get them lit. We ended up looking up, just to see Mr McMahon’s face glaring at us.  No- one would let it go. We were picked on for weeks. I remember all the birthdays and the time it took us to the money for all of the presents, not to even mention the parties. But there was a new pain in the arse every month. I remember each and every one of us chucking our guts up at one time or another. The pats on the back and holding each others hair back. I remember those evil passion pop bottles and us doing somersaults in Kayla’s spa. I remember Kimbo almost falling asleep on the pool cue, Kayla’s exorcist style chunder, Beck almost electrocuting all of us, Brizzy always thinking she knows best, Sideshow beck, sophisticated mama, enemy, fresh and the list goes on. They are all classic people and classic moments.  I remember everyone at my debutante ball in the middle of the dance floor jumping up and down to Khe Sahn only to have the clips on my dress undo and the whole front of my dress to fall down. I remember all of us in our drunken glory and some of the surprising hook-ups.  I remember Inverloch , I’m not even going to go into that one but I remember that no matter what we were doing it was always a blast. I remember how much fun school was each and everyday.  I remember the good times, I try to forget the bad but I do know that life goes on. It almost feels like the end of an era, but it’s ok. I don’t see them all as much and school sucks now but I will always have my memories and I will never forget.
