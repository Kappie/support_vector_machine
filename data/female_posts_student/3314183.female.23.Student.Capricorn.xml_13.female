I would like to be involved with a particular person but no, I shall hold back.  Suppressed agitation is in me.  I am finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible to relax.  Driving myself to a state which is possibly beyond the capacity of my resources.  Trust and self-esteem have been lost. I am unable to do anything to restore the belief, affinity and mutual trust.  I feel powerless to change the situation. Unfulfilled emotional requirements, experiencing mental and physical stress. I am attempting to escape from this by endeavoring to create a semblance of peace and serenity by refusing to allow myself to be involved. But...I know...I will have the strength to 'pull through'... perhaps sooner than I even believed possible.
