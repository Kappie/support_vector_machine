I've been to the amusement park before. It'll be my second time there but I'm still totally anticipating it. See, last time I went there, it was on aschool field tripwith my fifth grade class. It was fun then but my group, which had consisted of Katelyn and Chloe, didn't do very much. We had went on a few rides but no rollar coasters since we were all terrified of them. However, this year I'm not as freaked out as before. I'm actually considering riding a few ofthem. I'm notgoing with Katelyn and Chloe this time, though. I'll be going with my other friends, Sarah and Bridget. Sarah and Bridget, like Nicole and I, are identical twins. Bridget, like me, is older then Sarah, except by thirty minutes rather than four. Bridget, though we don'thang out togethermuch, knows more about me then any of my friends and that's including Katelyn and Chloe. I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets and she her's. Even though we don't hang out a lot, I feel this undeniable connection to her. She doesn't hate me for who I am. Maybe, one day I'll gather the courage to tell other people about my past, how I'm feeling, and all of that other crap.She gave me hope just by listening to me and trying to understand what I'm feeling. I hope that I gave her the same feeling.  Anyways, it's totally going to rock. Sarah and Bridget just came back from a two week vacation and since Cole and I took care of their pet, Bubbles, they're buying our tickets to get in. Isn't that nice? They seriously don't have to do that for us. I feel totally bad for allowing them. I'd gladly pay for my own ticket but they won't allow it. Gosh, I'm so happy that I know them. I'm not just typing that 'cause they're paying for my ticket. I'm typing it because of their generosity towards me, their compassion for how I feel, etc... Though I question my friendship with Katelyn and Chloe, I don't think I'll ever have to question my friendship with Sarah and Bridget. Bridget knows me better then Nicole probably does. She still continues to be my friend. I'm SO glad for that. Maybe I'm not such a terrible person afterall...  Ah, I am seriously loving my life right now. It's about time that I'm happy. I've been pretty miserable lately, whether or not I wrote you about that, I don't know... It's great though. I might not get the chance to blog tomorrow but I'll try to.  Bye.
