If not i'm usually beggin my mom to take me to Barn's and Noble just to read a book on Paganism or Wicca lol. Plus theres like a caf'e inside so I just love it there. Sometimes my parents just drop me off there and they go next door to Best Buy lol. But back to the uneventful day..all i freakin did was watch buffy and charmed then worked on my blog all day. My day's work is what you see right now lol. I know not much but these code things just put me thru loops. Then AOL time lol..i always hafta add that into my day just to keep up with everyone up in WV. Everytime I talk to a friend from there I just get homesick cuz I miss them and some of the drama lol. Not too much drama around here. All the drama I hear about in my city is on the news. All I hear is channel 9>in today's news a 19yr old driving in her car was hit by a Linx bus due to the blinding fog early this morning. (that really happend by the way) thats as much drama I usually hear about. Sometimes its good sometimes its just stupid. But I don't care. I like hearing about things.
