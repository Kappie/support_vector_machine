I know,I wake up pretty late, but in my defense I go to bed pretty late and well, I am not a morning person, but that is all going to change when I have to take the kids to school. Nalani will be going to school soon. FULL DAYS! Only a couple of days, Tuesday and Thursdays, but hey, it is something.      I have been addicted to this whole blogging thing the past few days. I think it is because I can actually get my feelings out for the most part. There are still things I can't get into here only because it would feel weird putting it on here.      Ed and I are looking forward to his brother and sister coming out here. I can't wait. I love those two. I am not as close to them as Ed is to my sisters, but not by choice. They are just a lot younger and well I don't get to see them all that often. I do hope though that I get to know them better and that we become closer.       So anyway, I have been thinking of what to do with my room. I am thinking of painting it another clolor. Any suggestions? We have dark blue carpet right now, what do you think will go with it? Hmm...Decisions, decisions...      My dad called to let us know he is stranded in Brisbane. The bad weather in New Zealand caused a delay and he was alte to catch his second flight into Darwin. LOL He said, "Tell Nalani and Bailey I said thanks for making me stranded." Bailey and Nalani were chanting, "Let's make papa late." Of course this was after asking me what would happen if papa were late for his plane....of course they only asked that because my dad was stressing out big time about missing his plane...anyway, as I was saying, after they asked me the consequence of being late I told them that he would have to stay here. So they thought it was a good idea to just let papa miss his plane. They were a little off, wrong plane, but hey, same sentiment. HAHA I can't wait to talk to my dad about it.      Have to go back to Camp Pendleton today and finish my mom's shopping. I am pretty much done. I want to pay some things off before spending again. Should be fun. I am pretty excited...grocery! Yippee, Ed is baking a chocolate cake tonight. YUMMY!      Have a great Friday and weekend.
