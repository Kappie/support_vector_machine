They can't go tossing blame every which way. So if something is wrong in your life, then fix it or quit complaining. Honestly. Even things that are out of your control are...technically...in your control.  I suppose that's just the way I think...and that thinking really has shaped who I am. I guess I didn't always think like that.  I always put some supreme power in control of my life and for some reason I kinda stayed in one place.  I'm not saying that I lost faith...well, I guess I did...but it kinda took that for me to get back on track. On whatever track I'm running on. And I'm getting that faith back...but it's in my own way, on my own terms. The only way to be content with life is to live it on your own terms.  As far as my life goes...I am content. I'm happy with the way it is, even if things don't always go right. There's the occasional dramatic moment that jumps in, but it's nothing I have to worry too much about. After all, that's life.  Sometimes you have to grow up and realize that.  So quit with the whining, people. Cheer up and get over it.  Well...I've got mucho the homework to do.  Ahh, my life is so crazy lately! ShEeSh I'm busy 24/7....  Farewell, crazies. Keep it upbeat.
