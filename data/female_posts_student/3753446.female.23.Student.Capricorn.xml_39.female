My mom underwent surgery Monday, a hysterectomy and appendectomy all in one (i.e. she had all sorts of little parts taken out). They did a biopsy and luckily nothing was cancerous. My dad was really nervous all the way up until they did the surgery, and I guess that was why. No one toldus (my sisters and I) that cancer was even a question. Its funny how we sometimesprotect people from vital information. Is it because we can't handle it or because we think they can't or because we're in denial or what? Regardless, I'm glad it wasn't cancer.    And overall, things went well. I spent two nights at the hospital with my mom and then thenexttwo nights she felt more comfortable staying by herself. Spending the nighton the 5th floor of MVHwas strange. Someone or another came in on the hour every hour. And in the meantime my mom was feelin a lot of pain so I talked with her and helped her walk to the bathroom every now and then. I gotta say, watching your mother shoot morphine every ten minutes is kind of interesting too. If there wasn't a limit on the pump I would probably have to worry about her. I think the craziest thing about the week was that after the sleepless nights, I left the hospital at 6:30 in the morning to stay home with my youngest sister so my dad and other sistercould leave for work. Who knew that leaving the parking garage at 6:30 incurred no charge? How bout that.Although it wasn't easybeing up so early, I have to admit, it was nice to see the sunrise again.    Other memorable notes from the week include the lady voice in the hospital elevator that said "Going up." It sounded like a dumb cheerleader saying "going Uh-up!"I bet it would have flipped its hair in my face if it could, but it WAS an elevator after all. I swear I've never heard an elevator talk like this one did.Although I wanted to strangle that voice a few times during the course of the week, I do sortve miss it now. And oh yeah, is it just me or does every hospital in southwestern OH have a Wendy's? My youngest sister, Piya, and I starred in our own episode of Supersize Me, eating off the Super Value menu every day for a week. UUUGGGHH. I think I have liver cirrhosis.I'm telling myself I have to avoid fast food for a month. At least until New York (which I finally settled on, over a really if-y trip to Orlando).    This morning was really cool too. As we drove to the hospital, my sister asked me if I saw words in the sky. And at first I thought she was crazy, but when I looked again, I saw a skywriter actually writing something. Along our half hour journey down St. Rt. 48, we read "AIRSHOW. WOMEN FLY. :)" You go girl. As we walked into the hospital though, something on the newstand caught my eye. It was a front page article about the nation's best female skywriter as the star of the Dayton Airshow this year! Guess I got a free show. :)  And among other ironies, being such a dedicated daughter and student, I had taken my endocrine notes with me to study at home. Little did I know, that after 106 pages of reading, I had been reading the wrong material! Thank goodness for a phone call from Aaron regarding the Cedar Point accident. We cleared it up real quick. So now, though I feel really good about myself, I'm a week behind. Gotta get back to business...
