I am SO sure. I love him. I seriously seriously do. Yesterday at band practise, I called Moses and talked to him about everything. About me being uncomfortable with stuff, and yeah... He doesn't tell Moca stuff anymore 'cos he thinks she tells me... What the...?! By the way, remember that the stuff in here STAYS in here~! You take this to your grave! Hee hee~ Anyway... yeah... Moca and Nima did their thing at band practise and I called Roger and talked to him about something. Got frustrated and crap but yeah... Cantonese comes in handy sometimes! :D Hee hee! Anyways... Yeah... Today, there WAS something on my mind and there still is... but everybody's got something on their mind always anyway. So blah. It's nothing serious anyway... I miss Nima... :P Ooh, you know what? He got hurt 'cos Octi hurt them and stuff... :S I hope Nima's okay. His ribs hurt... See?! I hate it when people get violent... I can't just tell him not to fight or do anything violent 'cos it's just what guys do... it's like telling me to stop talking! But.... I just hate to see him hurt... Vivian thinks so too. Who would want to see their boyfriend so hurt and stuff?! *sighzZ* Guys... they're so blah. You can't live with them, but you can't live without them. Screw it... I want to assure Nima that I love him and him only. Sometimes, he's not the one that has to wonder whether I like him or not... it's me! Haha! Blah... but if he's reading this I want him to know that I'd never stop loving him~ XoXo~  Love you... you know who you are.
