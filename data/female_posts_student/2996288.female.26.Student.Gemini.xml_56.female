There we are, doing rounds, and I start to notice that I'm very warm.  And dizzy.  And, when I stopped to think about it, it wasn't so much that I was warm, as that I was breaking out in a cold sweat.  And I wasn't dizzy so much as I was starting to black out.  So, in the middle of a patient presentation, I turned to the resident, and declared: "I have to sit down!" and then went running down the hall (okay, not running - but I was walking fast) to the nearest stool.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is about hem/onc that made me almost pass out.  I recovered after a few moments of sitting, but I was pretty embarassed.  It looks like this service will be quite different than CCU.  For one thing, the patients are much sicker.  That surprised me.  I figured people in after heart attacks and all would be sicker than people just coming in for chemo.  But, the oncology patients that end up in the hospital are S-I-C-K, sick.  Not a good place to be.  I have to go finish a write-up now.  I can't believe it is already 6pm and I'm still here!  This was supposed to be easier (or at least shorter) than CCU.  Humph.  No yoga tonight...  :(
