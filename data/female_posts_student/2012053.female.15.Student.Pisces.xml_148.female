COMMENTARY  By Tracy Austin NBC Sports Updated: 11:34 p.m. ET June 30, 2004WIMBLEDON, England -   For the second Grand Slam in a row, Jennifer Capriati played listlessly in a huge match, falling in just 45 minutes in the Wimbledon quarterfinals to top-seeded Serena Williams. At times in her career, Jennifer has been the more mentally sound player than Serena, but it seemed in this match she didn’t believe she belonged on the court with her keenest rival.     What Jennifer was lacking  You have to give Williams all the credit in the world for her superior play in the 6-1, 6-1 win, but Jennifer collapsed under the pressure of the occasion.  This was her most one-sided loss to Serena, who has won 10 of 16 career meetings between the two.  The match was in stark contrast to their two meetings earlier this year, wins by Jennifer at the Italian Open and the French Open.  It was also the worst loss in Jennifer's 43 career Grand Slam matches.   Without question, two-time defending champion Serena is a superior player on grass, but Jennifer is a much better player than she showed in the disappointing loss.  The problem was she was so flat that she was unable to impose herself.  While Serena dominated with her incredible serve and return of serve, Jennifer could never get her guns out of her holster.  Both women looked very tight to begin the match, but once Serena felt that her serve would be with her all match and she could keep the points short, she played as well as she has since Wimbledon last year.  Jennifer was unable to get into her groove because she rarely was able to extend the points and even when she did, Serena played with a cooler head and was far more accurate.  In going against Serena on grass, Jennifer didn’t have the same belief that she did on clay at the French Open when she was confident she would be able to wear Serena out.   The media's not to blame Given how many of their previous matches have gone down to the wire, the one-sided result was simply stunning.  Serena had her head and heart in the match while Jennifer was a mere shadow of herself.  After the match, Jennifer took the media to task for making too much of the rivalry and putting too much pressure on her.  That’s ridiculous!  Jennifer has dealt with these build-ups before, most recently in Paris three weeks ago -- and that didn't keep her from beating Serena there.   It was obvious that at Wimbledon Jennifer didn’t feel as comfortable with her chances as she did at the French Open, or she would have responded much better.  Like Serena, she needs to avoid reading what the media is writing before important matches if it’s going to get into her head.   Her fitness found wanting  In order to win, Jennifer would have needed to serve huge and play inside the baseline to try to jump on Serena’s big kick second serves.  Instead, she was gasping all match.  Jennifer admitted after the match that’s she not in top shape.  That’s a big part of her problem.  On grass, you have to be able to get off the mark very quickly as it’s tougher to recover.  Jennifer needs to get her first step back or she’ll have similar problems on hard courts this summer.  Even though she is 28-years-old, I believe that she can contend for titles all summer long.  But she and her new trainer will have to focus on her nutrition and her foot speed.  Once she gets to balls, she’s fine, but if she’s straining to get her racket on shots, she’s in deep trouble.  Jennifer has always been a fighter and loves new challenges.  After being buried by Anastasia Myskina in the French Open semifinals and Serena here, she has a huge mountain to climb to get herself back in serious Grand Slam contention.
