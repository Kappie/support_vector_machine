Freaked me a bit, obviously, but I think I'm ok now.  Just hope he doesn't come next sunday and start back or something.  That sounds really awful, I know, and Scott will probably not like me saying that he shouldn't be in church, but he shouldn't be... what happened to being burned by the holy water, anyway?
