I feel so bad and I'm really dizzy for some strange reason, like during the NHS meeting I nearly feel over because suddenly the room began to spin, oh well. Maybe it's all the Robitussin I've been taking, but it really hasn't helped my cough anyways. I guess it's just the weather that is making me all congested and stuff, I just want it to be summer already! :(   Lately I've been jaded life got so complicated
