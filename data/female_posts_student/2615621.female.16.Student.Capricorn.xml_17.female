YAY!!!! lol hes called me 2 times today we've talked on the computer, its like we're always talking, but him not going to school with me sucks major ass. I WANT TO SEE HIM LIKE ALL THE TIME!! I love getting his cute lil offlines about how hes thinkin about me and stuff. It like i like. :D I like the way he sends me lil kisses when we talk and how he does the lil love smiley face and then says "xoxoxox" awwwww lol I love the way he looks at me i love the way he makes me feel period. Theres never a dull moment with Lorne. :) It all just seems too good to be true. I wrote earlier how freakin tired of i was being single and how i wish i was prettier or guys liked me more, and just when i want it the most it comes to me. Maybe it was meant to be that way. Tonite i HAD to tell lorne by cuz i had to do some hw and i cant do it while im talkin to him cuz..well...lol i cant think about ne thing else. So, it took me literally 15mins to say bye. haha everytime i said ok im going and send him a kiss he would say something and i would say something and we would just keep going back and forth. He kept doing his kissies and his hugs and his xoxoxo and his love smileies. He finally said "damn its hard to say bye to u" lol :D haha yeah, its hard to say bye to him too. It's like i could talk to him forever and hang out with him for EVER AND EVER. I really care about him and well his best friend added me tonite and said that lorne told him we were already dating. Um..i thought we were just "talking" but hey, i dont care!! Whatever lorne wants to think we are. lol Naw, he prob just told his friends that...idk...he told his little cousin that too. His little couins is 9 and has me on his list also. he popped up today and said "hey lornes girlfriend, i hear ur hot" lol yeah ok lil 9yr old. He then tells me how there is a lil girl in his class that looks like a monkey and i die laughing. i tell him to be nice because one day that monkey will be really pretty and he'll want to date her. his response to that was "you mean like you and lorne??" lol he then asks what i look like and tell him i look like a monkey. he argues with me for 5mins over if i look like a monkey or not. I say "yeah i do" he says "no you dont" he finally gives up and says  I KNOW U DONT LOOK LIKE A MONKEY CUZ LORNE SAID SO lol so i give in and say ok ok ok maybe im not a monkey. He was cute, but lorne thinks hes annoying. then this 9yr old started calling me babe and stuff and lorne got onto to him telling him he was gonna kick his tail if he messed with his girl...wow...HIS GIRL. im lornes girl!!! YAY!! lmao hehehehehehhehehehehehehehehehehe
