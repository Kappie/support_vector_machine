For you stupid people who said to me "Man you made me feel stupid by storing alcohol in your room and putting on my invite no alcohol! And you were drunk." First of all you weren't even there you dumb fuck! And Second of all if I did have any alcohol I would have been so sick I had two extra strength tylenol because I the worlds biggest head ache!   I told lots of people NO ONE WAS DRINKING BECAUSE IF THEY WERE I WOULD BE DEAD!!!!! I am so disappointed in the people who claim to be my "friends" because they sat there last night and accused me of being drunk.   IF and only IF I was it was my birthday so why the fuck do you care?! (rhiannon I think I could use the word fuck a few more times don't you? LOL)  I am so pissed right now that I cant write anymore! Later Gator!
