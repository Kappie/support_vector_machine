It's been busy around the office and I'm paranoid about getting fired for spending WAYYY to much time online.....It's jsut that getting fired is NOT on my list of things to do this semester. This is a sweet job and this economy has got me by the proverbial balls.... Friendster is losing it's hold me.. and the commute to and from long island is NOT getting any easier . Anyone looking for a roomate? Must have cable connection for my computer damn....gotta go back to work...more later
