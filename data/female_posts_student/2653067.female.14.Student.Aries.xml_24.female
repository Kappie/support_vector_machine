It was the highlight of my week because I was eager to show Kevan around the school and see it with her to prove that we do have a better drama program.  Unfortunately, Kevan has fallen Ill which leaves us with un extra ticket which is unpaid for.  How do I feel about this? Disappointed.  I was really looking forward to this day.  How does my mom feel about this? Pissed off.  She paid for the wasted ticket and still hasn't gotten her ten dollars back.  Why did I have a feeling that this was going to happen?
