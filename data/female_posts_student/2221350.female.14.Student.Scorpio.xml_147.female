I suppose I ought to be a bit upset, but I'm just not feeling it. I didn't know either of these people and I don't think death is something to be mourned anyhow.   Friday... A very good day. Around midnight me, Devon, mom, and Lauren struck out and went to waffle house and wal-mart. We bought some duct tape and I got a whole bunch of my absolute favorite t-shirts: Hanes tagless stain-guard tees. I LOVE them. Came home, chilled and made duct tape purses.   Saturday... Got into some more juniper berries and felt awful((roasted brazilian snapper with buerre blanc sauce and spinach salad))((they were in the form of capers this time, and I didn't realize!)), but babysat anyways. JUST when I was pondering the idea of children and how they may not be so bad, this happens. I don't know why the little monsters were so awful, but...Yeah. Running around, screaming, punching, locking eachother in the dog kennel, hell.  Sunday...Messed around.  Monday...Swam all morning, felt shitty all day, don't know what's wrong with me. I suppose I feel sort of bad for not going to the grandmother's brother's wife's dad's funeral, and making mammaw go by herself.
