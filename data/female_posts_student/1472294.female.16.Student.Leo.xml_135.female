The Iran twins passed away within 1 hour each. Died due to loss of blood. Heard that the Raffles Hospital shares dropped quite a lot. At least they spent 29 years together and lived a fulfilled and meaningful life.... Hope they are happy in heaven.... God Bless Them.... - Right now typing and waiting for the news on the Iran Twins....
