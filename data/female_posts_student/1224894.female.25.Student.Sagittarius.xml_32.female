I was so uptight that I blurted out all my feelings for this person. I didn't know what got into me. But even if it was really shameful, i was somehow exhilirated because I was free. Still, i didn't get to sleep well last night.  You know me...and i'm still learning more about you, i just want to thank you for not laughing at me, it really meant a lot.  Hope you have a safe trip to San Francisco and take care.
