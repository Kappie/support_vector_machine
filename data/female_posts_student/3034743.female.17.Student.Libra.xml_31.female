When I was first typing this, after I typed 'you' in the past sentence, I also typed the word 'answers.' Crazy! Lets see....it is only 10:36, and a lot has already happened today! That is a change.  It hasn't been good tho. All I have to say is that I DON'T FREAKING UNDERSTAND CERTAIN PEOPLE. Always saying one thing and doing another...without explanation. What the hell is that? It's gay! I'm sick of it. From now on, I'm just going to keep stuff to myself, and not share it with people. They don't deserve to know. Ugh! I don't know, and it is making me mad. Oh well. I was supposed to go find Martin today at break, but I had other stuff to do instead. Oh well, I'm sure he didnt care too much. I got an email from Josh today, I hadn't heard from him for about a week. It was nice knowing he was ok, i guess, but it wasnt good to hear that he hasnt been going to school. Bad Josh! Oh well...speaking of school....yeah, I got a 37% on that math quiz that I took yesterday. I'll be retaking that and the other one tomorrow. Hopefully I will improve on them. In spanish today we got new seats because people were talking too much. I was put next to Erin, so that was good. We have too much fun together. Haha. Yesterday she came over for a bit and worked on some homework, but had fun for the rest of the time that we weren't. We tried to mess with Martin online, but it didn't really work. oh well. Hmmm....I wonder if this is long enough for Alex's standards. Probably not...she always holds me to such high standards! It's not fair. No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I'm tired, and me being tired is not good. When I'm tired, I get into weird moods. I am in one of those moods right now. Haha. Oh well. I need to read for psychology, but that would require me going to my locker and getting my book. I should probably do that soon. We may be quizzed on it. DAMN PEOPLE MAKE ME MAD! Ok, that was random, but I felt the need to say it. Hmm....I don't know. I think I will finish this up and then go get my book. Why yes, that is what I shall do! Hmm...I am so bored. I really don't have too much to blog about right now, but I'm just going to go off on something that has been bothering me, and Holli...if you end up reading this...I am sorry, but that is how I feel. Ok...I feel like me and Holli are growing apart. We've talked about this before, and have said that we've needed to work on it. don't get me wrong, Holli is great! I love her to death, too, it's just that sometimes I feel she doesn't understand me. I'll try to tell her something or talk to her about my problems, but I always feel as if she never really listens. It seems to me that it always goes back to her problems. I would just like to be able to talk to her and tell her what is on my mind without having to worry if I'll hurt her feelings. I want to continue being Holli's friend, and work on things...it just feels as if we are growing apart into different people. I find my self not being able to relate to her as much, and I've noticed that when I am getting along with her really great, we're talking about old times. I don't want to always be talking about the old times...because I want these times to be like the old times. they arent tho, and that makes me sad. things have changed, and i honestly dont know how to get them back to normal. i dont know, i just feel as if sometimes no one understands me. i was trying to tell amanda my story of how i felt and stuff, and she was getting all defensive, and completely missed the point. everyone seems to be missing the point....well not everyone. but i find it more harder and harder to be able to fully express myself to people...it seems as if they dont really listen/care. i could be totally wrong, but i dont know. not knowing isnt a good feeling either. i would just like to be reassured that everything will be ok, and that everything is fine now. if somebody would just listen to me talk about my problems, how i truly feel about things, and not tell me what to do, just listen...and not judge. that would be great. i think my biggest problem is actually that i feel holli doesnt understand me as much. and having the feeling of your best friend not understand you sometimes makes you feel that no one else does. i know that isnt true. i just need to have things become better with holli....hopefully they will. all i can do is wait and time will tell soon enough. its just frustrating having all of this inside my head going on, and not being able to communicate it. its awful. oh well. that is the way life goes sometimes...there is nothing i can do about it. hmm....i wonder if this is long enough for alex. haha...that could sound dirty taken out of context. can i touch your cochlea? a cochlea is a bony tube filled with fluid. it is located inside of the ear. haha. i dont know why, but me and erin find that extremely funny. we can be a tad perverted sometimes....actually, take out tad. I am a big pervert when I try. It isnt all the time tho, I swear. Well, now I feel weird talking about how I find myself to be a perv sometimes. So...just forget about that stuff. wow, I think that this has acquired some great length. alex likes the length. haha.....
