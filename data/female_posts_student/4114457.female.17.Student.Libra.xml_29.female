I wonder that a lot... I mean, what if you would have given that homeless guy your change from lunch? Maybe it is enough for him to do something drastic, and help someone else... I mean, you never know. Things really could be different in the world. Second, I can't over how everyday with Brian feels so brand new... I mean, he still gives me butterflies even holding hands, the most basic of gestures. I am just so happy. Last night I saw a commercial for cancer treatment or life insurance or something along the lines and the woman supposedly died, and I started crying because I don't wanna leave Brian under those circumstances. Idk, it is weird, I never before was afraid of dying until right then. I really wanna keep him forever. I have never had anything that just felt this right and comfortable. It is like a smile, 24-7-365. Also, I registered for classes at AACC. I was supposed to have Tuesdays and Thursdays free, but the Bio 107 was full on Mondays and Wednesdays. I am not sure what that is gonna do to my schedule as far as a social and work life. I guess it is just strange the way it all works out, but I am not ever gonna complain. I am gonna go wallow in happiness now, have a good night!
