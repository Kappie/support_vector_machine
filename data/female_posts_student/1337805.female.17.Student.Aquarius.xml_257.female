Some fire in Prince George has blown all of its smoke to Victoria, and now we're surrounded by a creepy, eeiry cloud which the sun can still shine though, but casts a scary, evil light around everywhere. It's disgusting. I can't wait for a wind to come along and blow it all away. Evidently it's travelled 600 miles to get here though. Hope it travells another 600 to leave.  Was at the lake today, cause I had nothing better to do but sit around on my materess and float around for 3 hours. As I slowly drifted into shore to my warm, awaiting towel, I happened to glance upon a disgusting young couple making out on the beach. It wasn't really that disgusting, at all, either, it just added to my extremely bitter mood. They were totally oblivous to everyone and everything around them, cuddling, and kissing, laughing. I don't know whyit made me so bitter, I guess just because of the bitter, no good, self-deprieciation mood i'm in currently (won't that make you so pleased to hear Dan, the ever powerful has feelings too, and is now feeling like crap. Awww... *pukes on you*). In any case, I can't wait to get my butt out of here and into my boyfriend's arms, upisland.   And oh man. I have so many chances to finally get even with Dan. Now the question is, should I be a vindictive, bitter bitch and risk all my remaining friends getting pissed at me? Or behave myself, and let this golden oppertunity pass?
