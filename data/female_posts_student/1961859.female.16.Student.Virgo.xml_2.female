Everyone I know is either already on holiday, or going to go.   One of my school friends called me up cos she really really needed to talk, so she’s like come on over, so then I went over to her house, at first I guess we didn’t talk anything 'serious' and as soon as I think we did, my mum called my phone, but I didn’t get to it in time so it came as a missed call, she then called my friends house phone and my friend passed the phone to me. I was expecting her to say something like ‘come home’ but instead she’s like ‘ Maryam’s come down from oxford and she’s waiting for you at the mosque’, so I was like ‘umm ok’ so then she asked ‘are you going to go meet her’, am like ‘obviously, cant keep her waiting’.   So then I apologized to my friend and made an appointment to meet heron tuesdayto ‘talk’.   Maryam’s changed a lot. Appearance wise, her pregnancy shows on her now. I spent 3 hours yesterday sitting in an empty Masjid talking. I don’t how I managed to talk so much, but topics ranged from Baby names (duh), University and Homeland :vomit:   One thing I deduced from talking to Maryam: My Algerian sucks. Arabic I can do, English (well duh) but I need to work on my Algerian. It doesn’t help when people from different cities to the one you’re originally from use words you haven’t heard in your life, or when they switch to French (Like hi, I don’t know French). The topic of Boarding at University came up, and surprisingly, Maryam shares my view. Girls SHOULD be able to board. We can be trusted more than guys. Funnily enough, when I checked Islamica, there was a topic about it, and as usual you got Jerks who completely rule out the idea of a girl boarding yet at the same time offer no solution to the problem of university being far away. Their ideal is that a woman stays at home. Bullshit.   Just like I made the choice to go to a mixed Sixth form college rather than a private girls one, not because of the guys :rolleyes:, but because the mixed school had the right environment for me to work in, and I didn’t want to be stuck with a majority of English girls. When the time comes, and I have to choose a university, if I think a university which I wouldn’t be able to commute to was the best place of study for me then I will argue it out until I’m allowed to go. If my parents refuse because I’m a girl (my brothers both board) and it’s a mixed environment at University, then that actually shows the level of trust they have in me. I think, and my friend agrees with me, that being a girl can be trusted more than a guy. Especially a Muslim girl, and even more a Hijabi Muslim girl. That’s because as Muslims, we know our boundaries, and as a Hijabi I know I’ll be (and I am on a daily basis) representing my religion as soon as I step foot out of the house. Therefore, in simple terms, I can’t afford to mess up.   And even if it wasn’t a case of representing my religion, do Muslim parents who refuse their daughters to board at Universities have a doubt in their daughters’ Islamic upbringing?    Don’t they as parents have a responsibility as parents to show their children right from wrong? Shouldn’t their children be past the stage that their parents have to tell them ‘this is right, this is wrong’?   Parents who refuse their daughters boarding are either:   a) Overprotective  b) Guilty of not carrying out the procedures for a correct upbringing or  c) Both.   Moving along, I talked to an American friend of mine. Its fun to have a conversation with her, I repeat everything really slooooowly. Sometimes I wonder if my ‘British accent’ is really so hard to understand, that she can’t make out ‘what did you do today’ unless I say each word separately and sound out all the letters.   Haha so I read over my post, and I must have written ‘girls should be able to board’ like 10 times. Saddo.   And I forgot to mention, I shouldn't assume. My older Brother is going to JIMAS (though apparentlyhe didnt know Sh. Hamza Yusuf was gonna be there). Its too late to book tickets, and he's going with a bunch of his friends. He says next year,inshallah, he'll take me.Yay.   Okies, I’m out.   Fi Amani Allah wasalam.
