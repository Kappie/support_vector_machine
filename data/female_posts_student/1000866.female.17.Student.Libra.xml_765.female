I went to De Paul today to visit and see the campus and stuff and I actually really, really like it. I like the campus and the surrounding area, which is where I'll be living. YaY Lincoln Park. So, that was fun. Then, my mom and I went shopping on Michigan Avenue....always fun! YaY Then, my brother and I took my mom out for her birthday dinner and gave her the gift we got her! It was fun! Super fun. Then, I came home, went to Bryans for a while, came home and talked to Chris on the phone for a long time. We haven't done that in forever. I guess I'm not surprised since Kristen's gone for two weeks. You take what you can get, right? So, it was just nice talking with him like we used to do in the old days. Hah.   So, my day began and ended very well and the in between stuff rocked. But now, I'm super tired. and must retire to my chambers. Hah. I've always wanted to say that. Night Kids.
