If you want ME to post it, I will to alleviate your feelings of shame.  I wouldn't say I'm shameless, but maybe more so than you in this case.  When will PB 1, 2, etc. be available?  I want one!  Or two or however many!  ;)  See you people tomorrow.  And what am I, Bureaucrat?  I think so.  I have escaped the vacuum that is Walt.  ~Z
