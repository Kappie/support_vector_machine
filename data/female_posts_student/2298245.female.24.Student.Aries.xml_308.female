I want to say at the fore that, while I am against abortion, I understand both sides of the issue and do not mean to denigrate anyone who is pro-choice.  I can even understand advocating strongly for that end, including protests like the ones this weekend.  And as a libertarian, I believe in free speech for all, no matter how much I might disagree.  Still, there are several things that struck me from this article:   Women joined the protest from across the nation and from nearly 60 countries, asserting that damage from Bush's policies is spreading far beyond U.S. shores through measures such as the ban on federal money for family-planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad.   Abortion is a constitutional right (more on this in a minute), and as such I'm pretty sure it's only guaranteed to American citizens.  Furhtermore, it is the right to have an abortion, not the right to federal funds, that is protected by the right to have an abortion.  Whether the government should fund abortions is a political question, and thus a proper subject of the protest, but I'm not sure that the government deciding not to do so somehow erodes the right.  They are two separate questions.  At least to my mind they are.  The question of keeping the Supreme Court on track to not overturn  Roe v. Wade , or the political pressure against a constitutional amendment banning abortion (neither of which are likely to happen either - more on this below), is different than the issue of whether government funds should go to the promotion, or even the performance, of abortions.   Advocates said abortion rights are being weakened at the margins through federal and state restrictions and will be at risk of reversal at the core if Bush gets a second term.   As far as I see it, only one right is implicated here:  the right to choose to have an abortion.  And I'll make a bold prediction right here:  if the President gets re-elected, nothing will happen to that fundamenal right.  These "erosions" as they are called might occur, so we might get even more complaints about the chipping away of the right.  But the right iself isn't going to go anyway, at least not without a drastic change in the current political climate.  An amendment to the Constitution outlawing abortion is pure fantasy.  It's been tried and has failed every time.  It will never get out of either House, not with the stringent vote requirements there, at least not so long as Congress remains fairly evenly divided along party lines.  But even assuming that such an amendment could get the votes, there's no way it would be ratified by enough states:  too many of them want to provide abortions to their own citizens.  An amendment that proposed to leave it up to the states might get more traction, but would, in the end, be equally unviable and would equally fail.  The best chance is for the Supreme Court to overturn  Roe .  But this is not going to happen either, again not without a major change in public opinion on the issue, or absent a radical change in the Senate membership.  There is no way a Supreme Court nominee who would be willing to overturn  Roe  will ever get confirmed.  And with the vetting of these nominees that goes on (the next confirmation is likely to be a blood-bath), it is unlikely that anyone could succeed in getting through the process using smoke and mirrors.  But assuming the right wing conspiracy really is vast enough to pull off a rather neat and impressive trick, at the very worst, abortion will not be a constitutional issue anymore.  It would not be a fundamental right, but it would not go away.  It might be harder for poor women to get one, because they would have to travel across state lines, or perhaps halfway across the country, but many states will certainly choose to preserve the ability of women to secure abortions.  And over time, more states would probably join the wagon.  In fact, if the Supreme Court hadn't stepped in and decided the issue when it did, it might have already happened that most states would have come to allow them by now.  Certainly the pro-life movement wouldn't have been as mobilized and as powerful and as centralized as it is today.  Which brings me to Hillary:   Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, said the administration is "filled with people who ... consider Roe v. Wade the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history."   I won't dwell on this point, but it is possible to think that  Roe  was badly decided without necessarily being pro-life.  And if you don't believe me,  urlLink just ask Alan Dershowitz .  If you scroll to the bottom of that link, a summary of his argument that sounds a lot like my own:   On areas where the public is divided on “moral vision,” Dershowitz (generally viewed as a liberal) takes the conservative position that the people should continue fighting out these issues in the legislatures.  The abortion debate, for example, hinges upon one’s definition of when human life begins, and this cannot be changed by experience (any more than can, say, the Axiom of Choice).  Dershowitz argues that Roe v. Wade (1973) would eventually energize the socially conservative movement (the “moral majority”) of the 1980s, while the “progressive” side on the part of female reproductive choice remained lazy as to fund-raising and political activism, depending on the courts.  (Dershowitz feels that a purely political battle would have otherwise settled for pro-choice.)   But as if all that isn't enough, I'll leave you with this rather bizarre quote from the first article I mentioned.  I make no comment on it because I think it speaks for itself:   And feminist Gloria Steinem accused Bush of squandering international good will and taking positions so socially conservative that he seems - according to Steinem - to be in league with the likes of Muslim extremists or the Vatican.   There's much more to say about this issue.  But I should be studying.  Perhaps I'll parse the rest of the article later for more things to say.
