Here's a GOOD news: "I was accepted!" but no, I'm not one of those major characters. Still, I'm glad, at least.      Then there's a lot of actuivities coming over my way, I don't know how to budget my time if in the first place I'm really not given the luxury of it. I can't sleep long hours, and I know my body darnly needs it.      Anyway, chums, as long as you're there, I know I'll be doing fine and oh, great.      I'll post MY PERSONAL ESSAY ON LOVE soon....the next time I'd get back and oh, I'll share to you din my essay for my application in Ateneo.      And oh, the UPCAT exams?????it was just fine, but the mathematics part kinda s****. 'Til here...you SALUT.       Ciao--------;p
