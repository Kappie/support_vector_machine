Only one of them seems feasible, and only for the short term, because it would cover my rent, my bills, and then I'd have to sit at home alone and not eat or drive anywhere.  But it's more than I'm making now.  I'm still holding out for the FBI job.  I'm hoping that I' haven't been disqualified from that one.  We'll see.
