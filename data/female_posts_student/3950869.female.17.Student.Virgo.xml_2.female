Although we didn't get to eat there b/c the wait was too long. So I tooka picture of the sign. But let me tell you the beginning of the story...ha WE GOT LOST ON THE SUBWAY..thanks to my lovely sister. So we were there we were going the total opposite direction in which we were suppose to be going for about an hour and a half. Once we got off it was raining-ack. Rain, Umbrellas, alot of people, and New York City do NOT MIX WELL. So after this whole experience you can imagine how cranky and irritated I was.      Yesterday we went to Six Flags Great Adventure. It was fun- I rode most of the roller coasters and convinced my sister to do so as well. So now she loves them too. Tomorrow is the reunion. I'm not sure how I feel about it. Hopefully it won't rain. All I know is that there are a few people coming from Ireland, France, and Austrailia so I'm excited about meeting them. Not much left to say...ciao
