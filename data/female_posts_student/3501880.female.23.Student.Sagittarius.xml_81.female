Well, I have put it off long enough, but with school about to start in less than two weeks and my lease expiring at the end of the month, I figured it was time to get another apartment. And an apartment is what I got.  Right now, I am giddy at the thought of having ALL that space to myself! My second to last apartment was the first apartment I had on my very own. It was a cute, little studio just a few blocks from downtown Salt Lake. I loved it, cause the bus to work stopped right in front on my apartment building and dropped me off about a block away from work. The main room was large and spacious, and the kitched had an icebox left over from who knows when.  It was small, but it was my own.  Then, I moved to law school, and thought it would be financially-prudent to have a roommate. It was nice to have someone around at first when I didn't know anyone, but then, I just yearned to have my own place again. I have come up with a new life philosophy on apartments: If I am not fucking you, I don't want to live with you.   No, that doesn't mean that I would have to start fucking my roommate just so we can keep living together (GROSS!), but I just think it is a generally good rule of thumb.  And now, I am able to live out my philosophical ponderings with an apartment of my very own. I just signed the lease today, and should be able to start moving in next week. It's a two bedroom apartment, which coincidentally happened to be cheaper than most one bedroom apartments in the area. How I am practically squealing with delight at the thought of having a guest bedroom/office at my disposal...It's almost aristocratic, really.  The only downside is that I have all this room and hardly any furniture o furnish it. What's more, I currently don't have the money to get the furnishing until my sweet ass financial aid check is put into my dirty little hands.   But overall, I am optimistic about my new living situation, and can have ALL the gentlemen callers I want without a nosy roommate there to gossip about it.
