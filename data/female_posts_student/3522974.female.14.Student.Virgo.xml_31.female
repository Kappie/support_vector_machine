Practically all their early songs are to do with christianity. (im not sure bout their recent ones)  Kudos!        "I live my life for Christ, but you live how you choose. We rock a show, we rock some more, He gets the glory, 'Cause this is how we preach his word and tell his story. 'Cause when it comes to my God, there ain't no playing around, we either get on our knees, or we can get down, and we can get down. So, come and get some of this christianity. Dedicated my life, now I'm a soldier of G.O.D. " That is from 'Get it straight'. And from 'Preach' "If it wasn't for my God, I would of already had you. Deny his name are you willing to admit it and if so are you willing to die for it. Cuz I am, He is my life and I don't have to fear death because he already paid the price." and lastly in 'Coming back' "No need for us to go down, the truth is what we know how. That we have life through my Lord Jesus Christ, no one can love you more, than to do the things that he did. So give him your pass, so that he can start to mold ya, Full-Fledged, dedicated, hardcore, christian soldier." Plenty more where they came from. TTFN-kc
