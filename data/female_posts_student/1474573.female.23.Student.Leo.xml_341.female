I hold a B.A. in Psychology (technically I think it's Liberal Arts with a Psych. Major) and graduation was actually pretty fun!    Unfortunately with the City Universities, there isn't any dorming and most people don't finish their degrees in the official 4 years it takes to do it, so I worried I wouldn't have anyone to sit with or talk to before-during-after the ceremony.  However, I was thrilled to see this one woman from my Spanish class from hell and this other guy.  Then we befriended some other solo guy and we all had a blast.  It turns out I knew about a dozen graduates.  That was cool.  Actually, we ran into this other guy from the spanish class who came up to us and was like, "YAAAY!  US STUPID PEOPLE MADE IT!!"  We had to correct him that a) we are not stupid and b) it was a really hard class - but we knew what he meant.  It was pretty funny.  He took a picture of us to remember the class from hell.  Actually, they both got C's in the class and were forced to take the final, which I wasn't, so I guess I didn't have it as bad as I thought.  But anyway, back to the graduation...  Bill Clinton was the Keynote Speaker (!!!) and honorary doctorates were given to Walter Mosely (who wrote "Devil in a Blue Dress" amongst others) Frank Sciame Jr. (an architect who helped redesign many of the buildings in Time Square) and Richard Schiff (an actor who is in The West Wing).    They all gave speeches and Clinton gave a great speech about us all being the same on the inside and that because of this we should try and work things out, not start wars.  Also mentioned that CCNY is like a United Nations, with students speaking over 130 languages.  Gee... and now I feel REALLY bad that I still don't know Spanish very well.  heh.  Anyway, I can now kinda see the appeal Clinton could have on an intern.  I mean, he knocked us all over!  After sitting in the sun for over 2 hours, with no breakfast because I was running late, we went to Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant not too far away from school.  Mmm-MMM!!  Smothered Chicken with Baked Macaroni and Cheese and Collard Greens!!  (drool) It was the bomb diggety.  AND my mother actually paid for the lunch for all of us, which was way cool.   After lunch and taking them home, our tired asses went all the way to Long Island to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  with the family.  It was cool to be there all together.  Steve's sister, her hubby, their 3 kids and my mother in law.  Almost all of us have read the books so it was fun to be all together to watch it.  Having to go to Long Island to do so kinda sucked ass, but whatchoogonnado?  I was VERY disappointed with the movie.  Visually it was different and there were obvious changes, like using more exteriors of Hogwarts, but overall it wasn't true enough to the book.  They cut out SO much.  I guess, if you've never read the book, you'd love the movie, because overall, it was a very good movie!  But basically, I was hoping for a truer adaptation and this wasn't it.  That said, I'll still be getting the DVD when it comes out.    And speaking of DVDs... AHEM!  YOU!  With our DVD of Harry Potter 2...you ever gonna watch it and give it back??  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARRRREEEE...  More in another post about the rest of the weekend.  That was only Friday!
