I'm not quite sure what or who is coming my way but I know what the thing "that has outlived its purpose" is.  Can you guess?  If you guessed "Cadets", you are correct.  I can't wait t'ill this Tuesday.  I'm a little afraid though.... I don't really KNOW how to quite.  I don't know what to say.  This is what I have planned:  I'll go to cadets (In my normal clothes), go up to the office with my uniform and all and I'll give them back their bloody uniform.  I'll also say that I want to resign because Cadets isn't fun and is interfering with my school work (Its also boring too!).  Vanessa doesn't want to quit yet.  I don't really know why but I'll tell you one thing, I ain't going to the end of the years' "Annual inspection".  If I go, they'll all be like "WHY DID YOU QUIT?!? NOW YOU WILL PAY!!".  Yeah.. I might be over exagerating just a little bit there...   To sum this little entry up, I'm just going to say that my horoscope is correct once again.  The moral of this story: Never Join Cadets.. It Blows Ass!
