Lord we ask that you guide and lead us and help us grow closer to each other and help us to encourage each other in our faith.   For everyone who's tired, either physically or spiritually, may you renew their mind so that we are fresh to serve You :D  We thank you for being the God who always loves us, even if we don't deserve your awesome love. May we learn to serve and bring you glory :)  In Jesus' name, Amen.
