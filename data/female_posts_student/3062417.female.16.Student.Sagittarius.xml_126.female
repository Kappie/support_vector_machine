Then I went to Laura's b-day party. Carol, Jes, Linz, Sarah, and Tara. We played b-ball, volleyball, and swam in the pool and lots o' fun stuff. I got a sun burn. Then Jes gave me a ride home in her awesome car. I want one. And I got home and my new Vans had come in. I love them. They are blue with a yellow and a greyish stripe. And now I'm home alone again for the second night in a row. This sucks ass. I hate being home alone. Does anyone want to come save me from lonliness?   Right now I'm just talking to Gavin and Jon. Later I'm doing nothing so I'll probally be online still unless someone wants to do something. And then tomorrow I'm doing nothing yet again. Oh how (not) fun. Well, I'll be around probally with an away message up. If you really want to talk to me that much just im me a couple of times and I'll probably be back eventually.  Listening to: [Baby Blue by The Early November]  It's a faster, growing green That flows through these leaves I have, I try, I guess we'll be alright  Way to try, I got a line For you from me, better nice A beautiful, baby blue Sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  CHORUS: But it's okay We'll come around With nights like this are never ending I try so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I know you want it all And you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay, for just in case that day  CHORUS  *I don't want you to love me anymore  With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me To let you go To let you go  My bags packed and ready to go But nothing's ever hurt so much for me To let you go To let you go
