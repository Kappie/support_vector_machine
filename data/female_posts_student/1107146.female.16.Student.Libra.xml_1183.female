Nice to meet you, in a way...yeh, I think that insanity is a normal, so no one should feel bad about what Lindsey said, or anything for that matter  (I still love you though!)  And by the way, everyone DOES love my sarcasm. Its a part of who I am, and if you can't accept that then, well, I don't really care.  I won't do anything about it anyway.
