I have long Brown hair, blue eyes, and am about 5'6.  Oh yeah, and I have a nose ring that I absolutely love.  Im not much on school, but I survive.  I get pretty good grades.  I take German as my foriegn lang. class, and ich liebe es.  Lol, I love it, German is a great langauge to learn, and contrary to what people say, it is an easy one to learn.  Anyways, in winter I like to snomobile, and in summer I like to swim.  I love to read and write.  I write a lot of poetry, and am actually being published.  I also would have been published again, but I waited too long and never sent in the stuff, but oh well.  I got a whos who for school and never sent that in either.  I guess I just didn't really have the time to sit down and do any of it.  Being a 16 year old girl with her license and a car, there isn't much time for anything these days.  Although I don't have a 'job' I do babysit a lot, which is nice because it pays for car insurance and gas money.  I always have plenty left over for shopping and movies as well.  So the way I see it, I don't need a real job.  Im content being an irresponsible teen spending my summer and money on things I don't really need.  Some people say there is plenty of time to be dead, so live life to it's fullest.  I say there is plenty of time to be responsible, so take advantage when you can!  Lol.  If I've come off as a flaky brat who likes to shop and go to movies, your partly wrong.  Shopping is alright, but definately overrated.  I love to go to the movies and do whenever I can.  (For example, yesterday my friend Leslie and I went to Stevens Point (Wisconsin Rapids was just to boring) to see the movie Dodgeball.  It was hilarious).  But Im not a flaky brat.  I'm an outspoken person who fights for what I believe in.  I don't just jump on the bandwagon whenever some new fad comes out.  If I don't like something I don't pretend to.  I believe in being honest.  Too bad if it hurts someones feelings or goes againts anothers beliefs, the truth is better than lies.  And don't get me wrong, I am not a completely honest person either.  There's the whole mom thing.  I don't exactly lie to her, I just don't tell her everything like I used to.  I used to tell her everything when she didn't freak out about it.  But now that I have my license, I'd just rather keep some things to myself.  I am a responsible drive, but sometimes a little crazy.  Don't worry, I never put anyone in danger.  But if some dude with a mustang (*cough cough, not mentioning any names, Cough*Dustin*Cough) decides to tailgate me, Im not going to drive like a saint ya know.  But anyways, ever since I got my license, she worrys too much.  She freaks if she hears me say something about what happend this time when I was driving, or what happend that time when I was driving.  I think that as long as I have things under control, there is no need to tell her.  Everythings cool, ya know?  Anyways, I put in a movie about 15 minutes ago and now am missing it.  It's Big Fish.  I heard it was a pretty good movie, so I am going to go watch it now.
