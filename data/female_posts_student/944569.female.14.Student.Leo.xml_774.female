It was kinda funny actually...Cuz she bought a lazer and we amused ourselves by pointing it in her brother's eye..Good times, good times.  It wasnt that bad...I sat with my sister and mom eating ice-cream..Are freezer wasnt working but it was still cold for like 3 hours..And at this shopping thing near us it was by 1 ice-cream get 1 free (because of the power outage) Me and Ruth were also playing cards...It was real fun..I really fiind the best in everything..literally.....I suprise myself sometimes.
