I love these because when you can't rely on anyone, they're always here to listen to you and your typing.. just depends on how shitty you feel though.. being a teenager is tough shit.. I miss being a little kid... I'ma cry now..    OK heres what happened today... today was Caleb's birthday and i had ordered him balloons, you know like $40 dollars worth of balloons, but it didnt make me feel good like it should have.. it only made me miserable knowing I can't have him anymore. He's going out with JuLee, but I cstill can't accept it.. its so hard for me to.. I'm just tired of missing him, I want to be his girlfriend, not JuLee. He and I are perfect for eachother.. but thats the story of my life..     I really don't know anymore.. I have 3 friends.. including Caleb.. but he seems to not want to be my friend.. after all he and I have been through.. he makes me so mad!!!
