I ran upstairs and changed and fixed my hair and makeup and such and then ran back downstairs to wait for him. Once he got there I dragged him right back thru the door so we could leave to go to the movies. We had to rush because he was supposed to come over at 2:35 and that's when the movie supposedly started, but there's always 20 minutes of previews, so we got there just when the movie was starting We went to see "A Little Black Book." It was a good movie from what I saw, except I really didn't see much of it because me and Jeff were making out the entire time. We actually had good luck considering there was a small row in the back of the theater with 4 seats and nobody was in those seats or anywhere near them. Sometime towards the end of the movie I was sitting on his lap but whatever. :P  After the movie we went back to my house. In the car ride hom he kept tickling me and blowing in my ear and my face and it was just hilarious because we were both being stupid. Anyway, when we got back to the house I was supposed to teach him how to dance, but my parents were always around and I didn't want to teach him how to dance and grind in front of my parents because it would be embarassing for him. We were on the computer and for a minute I was sitting on his lap because he put his arm around my waist and wouldn't let me go, and my parents freaked out. Then I was trying to share the seat with him and my parents freaked out about that. It ended up that I was sitting on the little crappy stool while he sat in the chair with his arm around me. I don't know what got into him, but he's starting to act like me! It's pretty funny actually. He was playing with my hair, and playing with my sleeves and sticking his fingers in my mouth and stuff.. yes, I bit him. :) He was being really sweet and romantic though in between and giving me nice soft sweet kisses and was holding me close every once in a while.. I really like that. A while later we had dinner with my parents and then went back to the computer a little while later and the his mom picked him up. :(   It was a really great day. Even better yet, I get to see him again this Friday! :) Yay! We're going to Chrissy's sweet sixteen party and I can't wait! I have to get her present still but I  will  get it before the party.  Anyway.. I'm done. Bye!
