Kuronue:  I don't know any other language except Japanese and English.  For your sakes, I speak in English.  Buddha:  I know many languages.  Baka:  Hey, Sanbutsushin-san, shouldn't you be helping Genjyo Sanzo and company.  Buddha:  Good point.  *disappears*  Baka:  Good luck against Gyumaoh, and tell Sanzo he owes me one-hundred dollars for that game of oisho-kabu.  Kuronue:  Isn't this Sanzo guy a Buddhist monk?  *picks up Baka's Saiyuki graphic novel*  Strange monk.  Baka:  Hey, that's my graphic novel!  Kuronue:  *holds above head*  Come and get little one.  Baka:  Hey, only my cousins are allowed to call me little one!  *jumps up and misses*  Give it back, you jerk.  Kuronue:  Oh, I'm hurt.  This is Kuronue, signing out for Baka and Buddha.  Baka:  *jumps*  Kuronue:  *hits Baka in head*
