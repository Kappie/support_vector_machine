They (whoever they are) say that spelling has no corrolation to intelligence.  That is probably true.  But I suspect that like any other talent/skill, the ability to spell can be improved with practice.  As annoying as  MSword is, I have to admit that I appreciate the appearance of the red underline squiggly when words are misspelled.  I think it has helped me improve a touch.  Anyway, if nothing else a spell checker would still be nice.  2) Visitor counter.  Yes yes, I know, we can manually change the template and alter our blogs by editing the code.  But I don't know how to do this.  And I desperately want to know exactly how few people visit my blog.    3) I also want to know who has been checking out my profile.  I know some of those visits were from myself (I was editing things and wanted to see how the changes looked...or maybe that is just a pathetic excuse for my vanity).  It'd be cool if there was some way to keep track of that.  Okay. That's it for now. Must go get ready.  Incidentally, if there are people out there actually reading this, I am dying to know.  Yes, yes, I know how pathetic that truly is.  and yes, yes, I know how uninteresting my life is.  but maybe if I thought i had a reader or to i could spice up the blog a bit.  or maybe not. it's not like the raw material (my life) is all that spicy.
