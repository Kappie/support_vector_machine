Almost everyone canceled on her execpt me Thalia and someone else but i just feel real bad for her right now,she was actually gonna cancel her party but she wasn't aloud for some reason. Anyway we went to another party tonight to say goodbye to Tia cuz she's leavin for Maryland. By the way that place sucked! alla the preps were there and me deidra and keith just walked around and stuff. I didn't really know what todo cuz i haven't been to one of those kinds of parties down here b4. Anyway..i didn't dance much..after a while i called mom and wanted to leave sooo badly. Me and deidra just didn't fit in that crowd. Just another reason i can say 'i hate it here' SOMEONE GET ME OUT!im serious someone come and get me and bring me back home to WV! Hopefully tomarrow will be better.
