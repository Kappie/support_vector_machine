To erase some very embarrassing clips from the tape? Yes, that might be one option. Because they are extremely self-observed? Might be an option, but highly unlikely. Because they’re bored? Sure, that could be it. Now, you might ask yourself, why is she asking these strange questions? I have no idea.  Spent a very pleasant evening with my kinder garden-home girl (gotta love that word, right?), watching TV and a movie. She’s the first person to agree with me on the whole England-matter, which I will not bring up again.  Anyways, the town’s very quiet, and extremely hot these days, and I can hardly sleep at night, so I spent my nightly hours here, in front of dear old ‘Puter, typing away like a slayer in a graveyard (my metaphor! I made that up just now!).   I mean, what’s the point of lying in bed, twisting and turning till you’re so exhausted you fall asleep, just to wake up half an hour later, to flip your extremely hot duvet, or to take off your nightgown, and slip on a top, or to open the window even more, or to just lay awake in bed again? Can’t really see the point in that, but that’s what I’ll be doing in a little while.
