God's just too smart for us...Too bad i can't get some of that genius for my Pre-Calculus homework...   Heather has been a blessing in my life...today I and a friend spent two hours talking about things that we struggle with...and i realized that Heather is a  true  blessing. I've always been thankful that she's come to our Youth Group, but today I know God sent her to us for a particular reason...And I thank Him for that.
