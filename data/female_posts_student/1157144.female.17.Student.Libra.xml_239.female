Please, reply to this blog and tell me preferrable times, days, etc.  I was thinking that after school on Friday we could go home then all go out to dinner and then go play capture the flag at a park...  We could do it @ hogue, but I and a few other people ran into a few problems with late nights @ Hogue.  Ferrell said that we could go to McGlincey (I don't care if it is spelled wrong, you'll all get it).  Whatever!  Just tell me because I really want to do this shizzle. Murda and back to the freakin' product...  I hope it doesn't take me too long *sigh*
