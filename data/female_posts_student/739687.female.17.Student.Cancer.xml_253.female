I need a little more excitement. A little bit more variety. I need new things, and new people. No, not  all  new people, but you know. This past week I've been sorta doing different things, and I really really enjoy that. Because I wasn't stuck around the same old people doing the same old things all the time. I don't understand how people can be content living like that.  I'm looking for new things.  *On another note...I had the best dream in the world last night. I woke up feeling so happy. And I don't remember a thing about my dream. Awesome.*  Find new things, crazies.
