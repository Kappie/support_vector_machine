I woke up around 11 and showered (it was lovely) and then Erica called me with the bus times. I walked to Annadale Train Station and got the bus, then I hadda transfer cause I got like, the right bus, but the wrong one at the same time lol.. I dunno you figure it out... So I get to the mall and Deb said her car wasn't starting so Erica go there and we ate at Johnny Rockets and Deb met up with us there and we walked around from 2 to like 5:30. I got a really cute skirt. It's rele like, short and I didn't have enough money to get the shirt that went with it so I didn't get it but i found something cute at my house but I dunno what shoes to wear with it. But, yea, my mom flipped out out me about it. She said its not a good color for winter and like its too short and she don't want me to wear it out but I will anyways lol. Alrite thats enough for today. Peace x0x0x0x0x0x
