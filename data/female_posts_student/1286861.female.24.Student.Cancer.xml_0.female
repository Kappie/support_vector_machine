I have been having trouble with my diabetes, resulting recently in my car accident. My absence was not received well at work. The tests that were done while I was in the hospital showed that things with me are not as they should be, so I can take some time and make things better.  I am at work now, and with only 4 days of work left, I find myself running out of things to do. So I decided to come here and waste some time. I can't get used to this though, I will soon be venturing out to search the job market for something small and part time to pay my few bills every month. If anyone knows of anything or has any suggestions, please let me know!   Maybe I will have some time to get back to my ranting and raving...we will see. A girl can dream.
