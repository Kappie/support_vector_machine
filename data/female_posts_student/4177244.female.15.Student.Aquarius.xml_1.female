And my cramps hurt really bad, too, so it's not like I can only concentrate on this. I've been clenching my stomach all day. But anyway, I have to get this out, and it might be really disorganized and stuff, but here it is.  Well, lately I've been thinking about  the way people think.  My mind, itself, doesn't understand the way most people think. Namely, boys. What the hell is going on in there? Wait, no, don't tell me. Hold on, I'll demonstrate.  *Start Boy Mind*    Italic and blue   = The mind of the boy.  Bold  = Girl talking to him    Seeexxxx...mmm...boobies...sex. Maybe she'll have sex? I can touch her boobs then.    Yeah, so Joe (or Bob, George, whatever his name is)...I had to cancel our plans for the movies, because...   Mmm, movies? Making out? Sex. Sex in the back row. And then more sex. Sex? Sex!!! Ooh wow, she has boobs...   Um, Joe? Are you mad at me? You're looking at me like you can't believe I'm cancelling...I mean, I'm sorry, but I have to...   Wow, her boobs are giant. MMMmmm...I could have sex with her and then break her heart so I can have sex with someone new and exciting! Seeexxx...   Okay...so anyway, I'm really sorry. But you can babysit with me, if you want.    I can have sex with a baby if I want? Oh my god!!! This is a dream come true. Wow, but babies don't have boobs...do they even have vaginas? Sex...      *End Boy Mind*  It's probably true. I might be overexaggerating a little, but I doubt it. I seriously think this is about it.  On the other hand, guys are so  stupid.  I mean, seriously. If you like them, they don't like you. And why not? If sex is all they think about, wouldn't they like you back just so they could have their chance? Everytime I like a boy, he doesn't like me, and everytime a boy likes me, it's because I don't like them. If I start liking them back, thats it. Operation I Want To Date Katie dies off, leaving me with a broken heart and no one.  What the fuck is up with that though? I don't get it. I think I should stop liking boys altogether. Oh, wait, another Boy Mind session is coming on...I can feel it...  *Start Boy Mind*    What? Stop liking boys? Yes! Yes! LESBIAAAAN!!! Oohhh, some girl tongue on girl tongue action, thats what I want, man...sex!!! YES!! THEY MUST HAVE SEX!!!...and I can join! And we can have a threesome! And sex! Sexxxxx!! Omg, the boobs! They will rub against each other and I will be a horny fucking idiot watching it all while drool comes out of my mouth and I stttaaaaaaaaaaareee!!! SEXXXXXXX.      *End Boy Mind*  Um. Okay. So that ending part was more me getting angry and having him basically call himself an idiot, but I think you get what I mean.  But anyway, thats not what I meant. I didn't mean to become a lesbian. Yuck. Girls are not my cup of tea. Even though I hate tea. But I don't like girls. Not that way. What I meant was that I would  wait.  I would wait for some guy to come to me. Stop telling guys I like them. It only screws things up.   What the hell. Sorry. I'm really in a bad mood.      On a final note:   BOYS ARE STUPID.
