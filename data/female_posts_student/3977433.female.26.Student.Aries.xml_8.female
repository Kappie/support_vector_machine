Even though most of the time, it isn't comforting.      Brunch with Laura tomorrow, along with food fights in the rabbit with sex and eggs? yikes,   should get interesting. just like jerry... Speaking of, someone get me tickets to Jerry Springer.   Oh, and a damned hot date. ;)      Sleep tight.     Feeling: Lonely Watching: Angel
