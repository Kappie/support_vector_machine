(now you have to know the story. megan liked chance, a lot. and when we were out with holden, nathan, and jeremy on friday night, meg called brandi to check up on her, and brandi told her than chance told her that he liked megan a lot too. so everything seems perfect right?!?!?!? exactly.) so megan cals me back this morning and tells me that chance was swimming in the woodlands saturday night and he just got tired and drowned. i didnt know what to say, and i still dont. i've never had a friend of mine die. the closest i've come to it, was when jessica kirby's little brother ryan died. and that was horrible. i remember leaving school to go to the funeral service at our church, the whole sanctuary was packed and its a pretty big sanctuary. i remember the whole varsity softball team sitting together crying when they played his favorite song, and drew's little brother mitch- one of ryan's best friends- just breaking down and balling a few rows infront of me. it was horrible. and i didnt even know chance that well, i had only heard about him. but i hate that megan is going through this. and now, thinking about it, im still shaken. i hate funerals, i've gone to so many, and i just hate them. i always tell myself that im not going to cry, that im going to hold it in, but at lil kirby's funeral, i just couldnt do it, it was so horrible, he was only 12. i just wish everything could be better for megan...
