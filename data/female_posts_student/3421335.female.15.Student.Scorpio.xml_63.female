You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair. You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say, Besides some comment on the weather.  Well in case you failed to notice, In case you failed to see, This is my heart, bleeding before you, This is me down on my knees.  And these foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart... You're breaking my heart.  You were always brilliant in the morning:Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you; You loved Mozart, And you'd speak of your loved ones, As I clumsily strummed my guitar.  Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else:Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself.  And these foolish games are tearing me, You're tearing me, you're tearing me apart. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart... You're breaking my heart.  You took your coat off and stood in the rain; You were always crazy like that.
