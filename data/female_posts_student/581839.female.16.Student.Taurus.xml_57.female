I met Adele, Russ, Jason, Tom, Nick D., Ginny, Anne, and thats about all. Mike wasn't there, and i was so sad, because i really wanted to meet Mike. Anyway.I went to the Fields museum and it was awesome, I saw the exhibit on chocolate. We also went to an aquarium. I got to go to the billy goat tavern, you know that SNL skit with the guy yelling, "cheesbouga cheesebouga!" yeah, well i met the real guy me- hi, uggghh, can i have a cheesburger please? the guy- you wanna double cheesbouga? me- no, no, just a cheeseburger. the guy- no double cheesbouga? me- no ah- the guy- but double cheesbouga's ah de best. me- no, just a cheeseburger (the man looks destressed) me- i'll also have a pepsi... the guy- no pepsi, coke. me- oh, ok, a coke. and, doyou have french fries? the guy- no fries, chips.  me- oh, ok, then the chips.... it was so much fun. Even though on the trip i acted like a brat.. hmmm. and i got a pair of converses. so cool. as mom would say, "kick'n it old school." well, i'd better go.
