Went home for some  urlLink Valley Brewery  and then in the morning Gardened till dinner time and ate at  urlLink El Coyete . That was simple... After dinner I had to finish things around the house and rush back to my dorm so that Crystal wouldn't kill me for making us late going to NYC Club  urlLink Spirit . We none the less left late (it was me, suprised?).  So we are hauling ass to get there, parking in Hoboken to take the path on the way picking up a pretzel and water. We get there and become some random guys couples so that we can get in easier. If you go sign up on the guest list. We get in and loose the guys, and it's the regular crowd. Pricey friggin drinks and never go to a man-tender there, they take forever, the females take  less time mixing a drink. So we start dancing and then creep guys start dancing w/ me and pushing me into his friend, like Night at the Roxbury style, only worse and only to me! Guy from the start saves us and we start dancing again. The guys there you can't tell if they are gay or just bi-courious or... maybe straight, but it is all questionalbe. I don't care really cuz I am not looking. We get into VIP no problem, and leave b/c it's beat and you can't dance there. WE CAME TO DANCE! Back to dancing and drinking, finally at 4:50 I had to get out I was so tired and dying of heat. We start walking and Crystal talks about her frustrations of men at the club. A guy butts in and we start talking to him, I judge him at about 30-35. We talk and he suggest Marquee down the street. And offers us a cab ride toward the path and drinks. We get there bullshit and this guy buys us drinks. I ask where he works and he's like "the  urlLink chrysler  building, its the tall shinny one". I'm like I KNOW, please only one of the most popular architectures, I live and breathe I know what that building is. So he walks the rest of the way to the path and we sit and wait (falling asleep) for the path.   Get home finally and I pick up  urlLink MCDonalds Breakfast  for us all (Crystal, Ross and I). I get a McGriddle for Ross and I, and I house it as soon as I get back. I lay next to Ross and happy to be next to a sane man who is so great and I say "Goodnight *kiss* I Love You MCGriddle Sandwich *kiss*", and right after passed out. Ross thought it better to let it go considering I had good intentions of telling HIM I loved HIM and not the sandwich. I assure you I SWORE I said Ross.   Morning, after falling asleep at 6am, I wake up at 12am to try and go to the city for Ross and his  urlLink AUTO SHOW . This was my early b-day gift to him, and I wanted to take him last week but I FORGOT, so I have to do this while hungover. I get upset and start balling how I ruined his birthday present, and while crying he starts making fun of me and my noises! Now I am totally confused cuz two minutes ago he was mad at me, and now he's like cracking jokes. I start laugh/crying and all a sudden everything is great and I'm getting ready. I didn't know what to do, he totally tricked me and it was great but, wow someone shouldn't have the power to do that! It was cute and I love him!!! So another drive to weehawken or whatever to hop a ferry to Javis Center. We get there and walk around the place till we are  Exausted. LOOK ME ON A VESPA   urlLink     urlLink Also have the Album For you!!!!! >>>>>>>Click ME<<<<<<<<<<   Saw Ross's future car, our future Bently and Mazardi and also my future HUMMER orignal! Then went over to  urlLink O'Farrell's  with Mom suggestion. She used to work in that area. "Fine food, Strong Drink, Irish Hospitality" and that it was! Very Irish servers.... Headed home and took a  "nap" at 7:30pm, didn't wake up till 8:30am and to a beautiful day I might add. Ross I love you HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY and I hope you enjoyed it.   We will see kill bill 2 soon I PROMISE
