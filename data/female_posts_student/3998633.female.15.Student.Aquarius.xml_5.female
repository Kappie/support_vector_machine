This will be the first year at a school where I will have no friends. Even though I still going to HTH my friends with bad taste are going to HTI and my other friends are staying at Point Loma. All seems lost for me, and that will be even more true if I do not get James and/or Eric in my class. I thought I might 're-vamp' myself per ce for this year as in wearing more girls clothes, blow-drying my hair and going back to the gold old days, when I kept to myself and did not talk to people for the whole year, not just the first week like last year. It won't be super easy but I think by doing this I will be able to get  all  A+'s this year instead 2 out of 3.  Best song to come out in a   long  time: Dragostea Din Tei by O-zone.
