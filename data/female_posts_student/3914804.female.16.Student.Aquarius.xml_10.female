Anyone sick - and i mean   sick - of LOTR fans, Orlando fans, Elijah fans, fans in general??? Staunch fans drive me crazy. What's with the freakin obsessional qualities, guys? G . E . T . A . L . I . F . E. thankyou. Celebritymania = same theory  Anyway, I am BORED. Parents out, house 2 self (which is incidentally WASTED completely, because every1 i know (barring 2) is on holiday   anyway. Ah the woe and misery of it all.  Boredom is a funny state of affairs (that's funny-odd as oppose 2 funny-haha). You'd think there were enough activities in the world 2 keep one busy, but i like 2 have the odd rebellion against LackOfBoredom, u know? Well u prbably don't as I haven't gotta clue what I'm on about!!!   Actually i've been memorising poetry - I caught this morning morning's minion... etcetera, don't ask me why, I guess I just felt like it.  I wonder what makes people do these things? A need 2 express themselves? Boredom? In my case I suppose it's a combo of boredom and another factor, which is that I love 2 write, I also love 2 type. About anything really. As long as nothing 2 icky like maths or physics comes onto the agenda! eeew.  I am starving, without parents I tend  2 forget about food if otherwise occupied. Til my stomach reminds me!  Just downloaded this thing called trillian (www.trillian.com) which is like msn messenger, aol messenger, yahoo, blahdyablah etc messenger all rolled into 1. pretty handy huh? yeah i'm BOOOOOORED!!!  Dogs r barking SHUUUUUUUUUUUUT UP DUDDDDDDES!  Argh I need human conversation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  eeeeeeeurgh caught a glance of physics separate sci revision bk. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Anyone tried chocolate crepes they're v yummy but only available from tesco and france apparently.  Can't wait til college it's gonna b so much fun (I hope you're listening, college, I don't want 2 be disillusioned!) had die bester Zeit (sick of crappy english superlatives), everyone was lovely , die Lehrer und Lehrerinnen waren wunderbar, especially my Law+History teacher who is v v intellectual! But fun! And swears a lot always good. We call the teachers by their first names, odd! No more uniform!!!!!!! Freedom 2 express!  Will miss me ol' buds thou :'-( but am already planning mucho visito to shrewsbury2 c them! (funded by EMA allowance and parents) I can visit on Wednesday afternoons off and weekends when the need takes me.  Better go the Family eill b back soon, the only "humans" I don't want contact with rite now.   l8rs
