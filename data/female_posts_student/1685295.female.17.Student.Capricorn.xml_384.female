Not that I'm loathing in self-pity or anything....noo.... On to other things more pleasent, we went to visit hunter today and ran around in circles trying to find out any type of information possible. Then somehow lost all sense of direction and was not able to tell east from west, north from south, up and down, by the end of the day. Quite interesting when we started floating. Ended up at Central Park where we were devoured by flies and spoke words of love and peace to each other. Yes the flies were talking to each other, such soulful creatures. Can you people tell I'm kind of sleepy? I sure hope so. Anyhoo, it's hot so where ever you people are and should you actually decide to read, I bid you good journey/ies. Whichever, have fun.
