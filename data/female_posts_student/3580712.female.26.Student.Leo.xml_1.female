Thought for the day:  I know many of you are probably tired and it feels like all of your energy is being taken up. We all work during the week, whether it be at our careers or at our families. It is still work. And I know we look forward to that sabbath rest, but don't forget that everyday should be a day of renewing our strengths. Tap into the spring of the "living water"!  May God be with you throughout the rest of the week.
