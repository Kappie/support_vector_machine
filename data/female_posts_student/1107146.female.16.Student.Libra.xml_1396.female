Um, that would Josh and....oh, wait, just him.  Well, yeh.  Thanks again.  Wait, what about a movie?  I'm guessing that you went to a movie during the course of the week?  Gone with the Wind rocks!  I love it!!!  I guess it's ok if Alex comes in something other than a kilt.  Well, I'm really really really really really really really really really really really tired. I stayed up until 4 this morning and got up again at 7.  Then I got to ride a bus for 10 hours...on which it was impossible to sleep.  So, yeh, it was fun.  Anyway, I'm glad Auburn was fun, Linds.  I know you didn't want to go.  I think that...ok, I totally forgot what I was going to say.  I'm way too tired.  I'm just kinda sitting here in a daze, knowing that I still have so much to do.  I need to go, I can't really see anything anymore.  That's not too good.  I'll tell you all, maybe, about my week later.
