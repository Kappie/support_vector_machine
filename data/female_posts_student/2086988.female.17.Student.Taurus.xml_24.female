Too bad the person I wanna go with can't go with me :( This week is going to suck, I have rehearsals after school till 8 and 9 pm. Dress rehearsal is Tuesday, and we perform Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, wahooness! I hope this is a light homework week, please...because I'm going to have like no time at all to do anything, so yeah. Which I really need to be memorizing my lines for The Importance of Being Earnest, considering I perform that on December 5th...but it'll get done, eventually, lol. Well I need to go clean my room and read some of Huck Finn. What a exciting night!   The snow is falling, the city is white Your eyes are shining, like diamonds tonight And we're all alone, there's no one home You're finally in my arms again
