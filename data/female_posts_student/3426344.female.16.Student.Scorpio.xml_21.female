I wanted to play french horn this year but stupid Maydawg wouldn't let me...he said he needed me to play bassoon for the musical...it ends up, I went on a cruise during the musical anyway and he was mad at me but oh well. :-P   I got stuck playin mellophone cuz when I was in 8th grade one of my friends from basketball that was on the varsity team asked if I would and one of my good friends decided to play also so...yeah.  At the moment I'm the oldest mellophone player and uh...I haveta teach all da newbies how to play. lol fun stuff  How'd you get stuck playin it?  Maybe I'll see ya sometime at a marching band thing if S.V. goes to any of the things Knoch does...not that I'd recognize you or anything lol
