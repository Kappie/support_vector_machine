We need to go, either just me and you, Linds or as a big group with the other people on this blog...if they wanted too.  But no one has said they do...so....yup.  Me 'n' Kyndall had a fight yesterday, and I can't tell if everything is back to normal.  We haven't really gotten a chance to talk about it.  Boy, she really knows how to make people feel terrible though.   And the Travis thing.  Yeh...I don't know what I'm going to do about that.  I will call you when I get home this afternoon, but this evening  I am going to a "coffee house" at St. Philip's church in Downtown Franklin.  Anyone want to come?  I don't really know any of the details, but I will later.  I think.  Hummm..what  else is new?  I don't think so, at least in my life.  Won't be talking to Travis online this weekend....sigh...so sad...he's at his dad's house, which I should probably find out where it is.  How much you want to bet that he lives like right next door to me every other weekend, and I have no clue about it.  Actually that would be kinda weird...what if he knows and like, watches me?  Ok, now I'm just scaring myself.  Anyway...did you e-mail him?  Has anyone else talked to him? I'm sure he's  being pounded by everyone in the universe now.  Even my friends at school are like "where does he live?  We want to talk to him."  It's ok that you had to go last night, your mom sounded really mad.  How was your choir concert? Oh, wait you just said that it went well, never mind.  It's cool that you went out with your dad for dessert.  Did you get ice cream?  or are you saving up for the Godiva Belgian Dark Chocolate and Brownie Batter?   Um, does anyone what to come to the play Saturday at 7:00?  I might go, if anyone else wants to.  Tickets are $8, so I can pick some up, I just need to know how many.  What else is new in your lives?  Oh, if anyone wants to go the the Coffee House thing with me, just say the words.  The only person I will know there will be Carmen and she'll be waiteressing tables.  I don't want to go alone.  Do you know how pathetic that would look?
