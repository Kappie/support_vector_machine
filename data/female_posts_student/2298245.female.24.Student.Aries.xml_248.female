So, I think to myself, wow, I have an extra 15 minutes.  Except, upon reflection, I really don't have any such thing at all.  I have 15 minutes now, but it is not like extra time has dropped itself into my day.  It'll have to come off the time I have later, and I really shouldn't feel like I have a minute to spare.  Yet here I sit, not working on my paper, not doing anything but typing this and watching The Weather Channel, because we all know its more important to avoid bad weather than it is to get our most important tasks done.  I am so frustrated with myself.  Yet three of those minutes have already gone by, and more will continue to do so, with me doing nothing of consequence, nothing I'm going to even remember at the end of the day, certainly nothing I would include in the biography of my day if it came to that.  And I continue to waste away the time, and waste away myself, for time is energy, and now I am awake and alive, and I should do things when I am like this, rather than at the end of the day when I am tired and deflated and unable to continue.  Yet I'm sure at 3 am I'll be sitting at this keyboard, just like I am now, only then I'll be typing for my life, trying to finish something that's due tomorrow.  And maybe the 15 minutes might seem small, but they really add up.  And every time I have some excuse:  oh 15 minutes isn't enough time to get anything done, oh I need to sleep later because I feel myself coming down with a cold, oh it's 10 pm and I'm never that productive at night.   If I'd used all of the 15 minutes that I've given up over the past semester, I'd certainly be less stressed now.  I wouldn't be behind in my school work, and I wouldn't have had to skip class to make up for it.  I wouldn't be going into April - the busiest month of the semester - further behind than I should be.  I'm actually looking forward to April, because I will no longer be saddled with this paper (or at least I will be less saddled with it - this is after all only the first draft), and I will be able to focus on the really important law school thing, which is preparing for exams.  It is indeed frustrating sometimes to be me, and to not be able to escape being me.  It's as if my own anger toward myself doesn't matter to myself.  There's a great internal struggle between me and me.  I don't believe in world peace, but I do at least think that my two warring selves should be able to work together, to co-exist.  After all, they are both me in the end, aren't they?
