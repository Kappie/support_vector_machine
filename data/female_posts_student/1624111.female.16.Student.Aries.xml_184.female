(cackles maniacally) but no. i weigh 107! woooo. even after all that cake and ice cream and pie. ...or maybe that hits me later? well, we'll see.   i shouldnt be proud of that, because im still not in very good shape(/as good as id like to be) as evident from my achey feet from the walk yesterday. and i shouldnt care about weight in general because what does it matter? im healthy. dont be a stupid body-image obsessed teenager, amanda. yeah, yeah...id like to think im really not.  for whatever reason though, it makes me happy to know i dont weight enough to give blood.   and...okay, i should go do my english homework and im emilys away message.
