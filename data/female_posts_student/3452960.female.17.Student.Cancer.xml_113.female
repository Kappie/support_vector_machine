On the way there, we walked by some scary drunks and plenty of bastards from Plymouth, but that's to be expected when you wander through Plymouth anyway.. We got to the cinema, paid our money and went upstairs to queue for Shrek 2 in screen 9 (it starts at 8.00)  *90 minutes later, the film ends*  That film was damn good. The character depth is, once again, explosive. Puss-in-boots was a fantastic addition to the team. Usually when a character is added in a second movie, they tend to be a bit... shite. Shrek 2 kept its 'Shrek-ness' with its fairy tale gags.  All of the songs and singing worked very well. I have never heard 'I need a hero' work so perfectly :D  For the nerds: Shrek 2 kept the high standards of CG set by the original. At times you can swear it's real. The giant cookie guy (forgotten his name :S) was fantastic. Especially when he was sinking in the water.   All in all, a very good film.
