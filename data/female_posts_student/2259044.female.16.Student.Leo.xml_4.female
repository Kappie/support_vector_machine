For, i'm just a girl in the world and i need ur sweet love to ease all the pain. Or am i still waiting for this world to stop hating, just stop in the name of love, cuz baby there ain't no mountain high enought, to show me the meaning of being lonely.  I love u more than a fat kid loves cake but Mr. Reynolds said 'may the horse be w/u" i'll b ur crying shoulder, but i'll still pick my friends over u.  Never thought i'd b the one who'd slip but in the end it doesn't even matter, so come give me a hug.  I'm alone and the world is having more fun than me.  Take my breath away for i searched the world for a poem i could write.  u r my fire, my one desire and i've found that there's something women like about a pick up man but i wish they all could be california girls.  and i wanna talk about me cuz i'm bad to the bone, can u help me find a way to carry on? see where i've been, i know what ur going through.  i know ur name and i weep when u hurt and i cheer when u win.   i luv u all shine w/the stars forever, one luv, one God, one way: Peace out pallies!!  that was my farewell poem for drama 1 last year, but i really liked it, so i typed it out for all-a-yall hope u enjoy it (if u were wondering where u heard some-a that stuff, they're all song lyrics, cept the begining and the end.) anyhow, changedfish
