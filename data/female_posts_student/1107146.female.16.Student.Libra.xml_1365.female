At Concord, get on the interstate and head south towards the Franklin exit, which is where you'll be getting off. Take a left off of the onramp, and you'll be on 96. Just keep going down thataway until you hit a hellacious amount of signs for the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, or if you see the sign for Newcastle Road, but it's a bit small, and blue if I recall. Then just go down the road til you hit a bunch of freaks in Renaissance clothing waving flags towards the parking area, and BLAM, there you are. Or you could go to  urlLink MapQuest  if you don't entirely trust me and type in the address there, which is 2124 New Castle Road, Arrington-Triune, TN...the zip code really doesn't really matter if it asks. OR, better yet, you could go to  urlLink the Tennessee Renaissance festival website , which is a direct map to the place. There you go.  Sweet. Whoall am I taking, goshgolly?
