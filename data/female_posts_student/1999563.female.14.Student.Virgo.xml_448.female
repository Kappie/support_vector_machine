No, not kerry..well he was there..but thats not who I am talking about...  SEAN AUSTIN!!!!! I was like wow...what the heck. Then this band played it was like everclear or something..they weren't very good. Eveyrone was like "Boo!"  Then Dean spoke...then Kerry spoke. Yeah. But, who cares about them ;) I saw SAM!!!!!   I am so excited.  It was like anti-bush zone totally. It was a little scary at some times.... But yeah, twas fun.
