It was nice to see him and hear his voice and know that he wasn't just text on the computer screen. It's a very intense feeling. I can't even describe it. His hair has gotten so much longer since I last saw him! I don't know if I like it all that much (sorry Gavin,no offence to you, ur still an awesome person, but you know that I always say what I think). My hands were shaking so bad. And of course I looked like absolute crap. But other than that, things were good. I think? It's like surreal to me now. I keep thinking, "Did I really just see him?, Or is it just a figment of my imagination?"
