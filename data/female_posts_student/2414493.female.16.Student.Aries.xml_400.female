Or maybe it's just sleeping where I sleep, with all my hair wrapping around my neck. I've pondered more than once about cutting it off, but it's probably wise to keep it for senior pictures. I dislike being sick. I woke up with a strange, bloody nick on my thumb.  I never realized how good Kudos bars are.  Today's to be a reading day, I suppose.  And I'd better change before I go to lunch.  Happy birthday, Nige.
