(i also slept on the park bench). we went back. my mom picked me up. and andrea. my septet is amazing!!!!!! i had sooooooo much fun. jake, connor i love you! megan i love you too! mary is cool as well. and of course, andrea. we are really good, and i have the best pictures. after the septet, i went home, did my laundry and my family went to the cochrane's (where my sister lives) and had dinner. i got in trouble for being withdrawn and unhappy. i was really unhappy. seeing my sister upset me. those of you that know me well know what's going on. and i'l ltell you about it later. now i'm home, again. and i have homework. by the way, eric, i will miss you when you move, very much. you are my childhood buddy. later.
