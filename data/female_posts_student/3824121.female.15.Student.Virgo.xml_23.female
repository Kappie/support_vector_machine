My heart goes out to the families who weren't prepared and who lost their hopes, dreams, and families to Charley. 8 people all together were killed. And now on to the regualarly scheduled rant:)  *Bangs her head against a wall*  I need to leave this house, I need to leave hell hole for bigger, better and probably brighter (or crappier) days. You know its bad when I'm anticiapating being out of this house on a daily bases, FOR SCHOOL!!! That's just...just... wow. My mom is all in a hiffy mad and completely obnoxious because I am a teenager. Yes, I have commited the all to horrible sin of having an OPINION. I am embrassed and angry. She always, always has to put her two cents in. This is what I get for leaving my room on days she's off. It my own fault for having an individual mind.  I still think i'm loaning this body from her cause she always has to tell me something about it. I feel like a little kid who can't take care of herself and needs her mother to hold her hand every step of the bloody way. She wants a kid to baby and choose shit for, well, ma, my nephews right there waiting to be babied and waiting to leave me the hell alone.  I wanna get out of here, just go someplace calm, quiet and serene. I know orlando ain't the perfect place to do that but hey, I want tranquility dammit. *Closes eyes and repeats mantra* I am going to go insane, I am going to go insane, I am GOING to go insane...Peace, Calm, Tranquil insanity...
