It feels a lot more like home here anyways. Nothing really happend to much today, except Jake got his tooth fixed so now the only thing wrong is his nose is still broken but you cant tell and his eye which is almost better. So today has been and alright day, I went and got everything from my dads house and later Im going back to make some money at his house for cleaning out this room. So that should be fun because there is all kinds of stuff in there, plus I get money, so ya know. I get to paint my room soon, I just still havent gone to get the paint yet. Well I think Im gonna clean here right now, because its kinda messy. LOL. Tell then, Later Days
