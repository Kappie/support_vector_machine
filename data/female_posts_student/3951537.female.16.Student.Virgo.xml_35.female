I figured it out immediately, the wiring was done and the ethernet up. rah rah. but then, the internet would not let me browse. i could IM, but nay, all I got was a message saying that the proxy server did not authorize me to view that page. so, you know what? I SHOWED THAT PROXY SERVER. I DISABLED IT. and now, my internet works. ah, life is beautiful. THEY'LL NEVER BRING ME DOWN!!!!!!      next on the agenda: emily's musical adaptation. it's awesome. see the post right before this one      thirdly: I HAVE CABLE. IN MY ROOM. i will never leave that fortress again. just give me a fridge. and a microwave. and a pantry. i'll have to take someone hostage and put those up as my demands. and one of those single-burner things... so i can cook.      we worked on cleaning out roz's offices today. found lots of weird stuff. files and programs from the 60s. Impressive stuff. Trashed most of it. Worried about next year. Really really.      Next: It's officially asshole day. Just to share.      Ways to die in the Guild theatre: that kid (not mentioning names), being mauled in the dark, the house not being completely together (yes, loose boards, though andrea insists they dont NEED to be screwed in there), circuit breakers, circuit breaker boxes, ghetto dimmer system, nooses, um, falling from the loft, ghetto light board, screwy ladders, feedback, emily, and i shall continue later)      hmm, otherwise my life seems uneventful. bah.
