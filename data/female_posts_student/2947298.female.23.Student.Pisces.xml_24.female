It is amazing how I can't walk around my room without a memory of someone from my past hitting me.  Er, bad use of words.  But since the move I had to go through stuff.  I find notes from eight grade and such, ex crap, photos from my childhood long lost.  And then the piles and piles of crap that I should have thrown out a long time ago.  So I got home and watch  Somethings Gotta Give  with Ross.  It was interesting.  Then we woke up early and started work on The Garden (back breaking work it is).  Man what a pain in the ass. It will look great one done... which will be in a few weeks.  Then hopefully it will live, working on the karma.  It's our project.  Gosh I miss my bed with it's new fluffy matress and the blue color room. No matter how far you run you can never escape the past, damn it.  Ross is a great support of everything that has been happening, just in a bit of a funk or something. To much stress and what not. A relaxing vacation will be great! Can't wait for our cruise. Gonna go meditate now... late.  Harry: I have never lied to you, I have always told you some version of the truth.  Erica Barry: I DO like sex! Harry Sanborn: You certainly do.  Julian Mercer: The woman is really very brilliant, but she cannot hold her liquor. Erica Barry: I like that about me. Harry Sanborn: Me too. [At the same time as Harry]  Julian Mercer: Me too. Erica Barry: If I were writing this, this is where I would write "an awkward moment". Harry Sanborn: Honey, if you were writing this, I'd be DEAD! - Something's Gotta Give
