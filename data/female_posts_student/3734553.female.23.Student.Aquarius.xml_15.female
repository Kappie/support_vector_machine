Was thinking about Evan recently.  And it was funny, because I got news from Africa last Thursday and usually I rush to tell Jamey or Krysten.  And when I was with Jamey this week I totally forgot to tell him what I had heard.  One of the last international aid organizations has pulled funding from Guinea.  And it happens to be the group Evan was working with, the French will be gone by mid-July.  I have no idea what this means as far as his projects.  I hope he won’t have to start over completely after 6 months of effort.  But I do know that the people leaving are the people he was answering to.  I hope he speaks Malinke well enough to get by since no one speaks English and the French officials are leaving, and they are the only people who speak French. I really think it is over for good.  I don’t think there is any going back to what we had.  Part of what I loved was the innocence of it all.  Our relationship hadn’t been tainted by doubt at all, and now that is all it consists of.  And I have a hard time getting over doubt, as seen in past relationships.  I am going to Garage Sales tomorrow to look for antique lamps and curtains.  I am so excited I can’t go to sleep.  I’m such a dork! So easily excited.
