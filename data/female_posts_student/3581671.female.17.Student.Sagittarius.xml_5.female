Mentally I am not doing so great.  Everybody around me is like, 'she's doing so great and eating well blah blah blah' but they don't know how I really feel.  I feel like such a fucking failure because I eat,  don't deserve to eat I'm too fat and eat too much.  I went to an ed website and I had 3 out of 5 of the symptoms of bulimia.  I hate it, it's not like anorexia where if you don't weigh enough they hospitalize you, recovery is totally up to me.  no pressure there. And people pity anorexics because they're so frail.  People with ed's are just manipulitive cunning creatures. I can't wait for college when I don't have to be around food all the time and I can lose weight. After all, if there is no food to eat, I can't throw it back up right?  My mother said something the other day to my dad, she said about anorexia 'After someone's recovering from anorexia, there comes a point when they can't go back (to being anorexic)'  that pissed me off sooo much.  So many times a day I wonder what would happen if I just stopped eating and decided to get thin again.  I feel like I should just stop eating again just to prove her wrong.  That sound so warped but I feel like when she said that she thinks I don't have enough will power to starve myself again.  I don't know what to do. ED's SUCK MAJOR!  On a good note, I leave for WP in less that 2 weeks. YIPEE! arevoir!        katie
