My brother wont be there and neither will his girlfriend who use to be a friend of mine... Its going to be great I'm going to party and have fun and wont have to deal with crap from my brother and his girlfriend... It seems whenever I am in the same room as them all they do is try and cause problems... That's all they did last time I went to my cottage with them.
