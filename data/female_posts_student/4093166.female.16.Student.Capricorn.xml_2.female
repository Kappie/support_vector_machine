My aunt tried to wake me up at 8 this morning, but I fell back to sleep.  Anyway, I think I am going to the movies today with my family.  I don't even know what is playing so I have no clue what I am seeing.  OMG  My 9 year old little cousin is running around outside in his underwear.  I think there is something wrong with him...  If you can't tell by now, I don't write in journals or blogs, so this blog probobly stinks.  Ohh, update on that crush thing, he says I didn't ruin anything, but he's still in love.  I can understand that... I know it takes a long time to get over someone you love.  I have been there and done that.  Well, there really isn't anything new to write considering I just woke up. L8er, Jami
