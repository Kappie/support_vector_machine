So now my knees are killing me. both of them, I cant even bend my knees. I hate these weak knees of mine. I wish they were stronger so I could do all the things I want to. Like cross my knees, so I can sit down comfortably..oh well......thats all I have to say...I think I am going to go onto Gaia now.
