I thought that I would have to slaughter my computer for impertanence but it seems that I will not. Everything is ok, life is good. I had written this huge post (as you can see) but my computer had a hissy fit due to the fact that it has not had ample care since we left (the Gnome doesn't know how to take care of the computer really well). needless to say Ithought that it ate my post, it didn't. And so I posted it this morning... Duh. I guess you got that.       I love noght time. For writers like myself it is so bloody inspirational! Last night while listening to my Evenescense CD I just got all these ideas in my head and couldn't not listen to them. So I ended up just writing away! But enough of that. As I said I''m not ready to share yet, it's still too raw. I will admit though it got frustrating because my mother just barged in the room in search of betteries and it totally disassembled my muse :(       Today I'm going to work out. I've missed two weeks after doing two weeks. It shouldn't be too bad though because I've kept active. I did a lot of walking and such while on vacation, so this shouldn't be too much of a shock to the system. I just hope that I have something to wear! I know that sounds corny but it's true I only really have about two pairs of shorts that'll do and I used one of them on vaction and I think that the other may be MIA in the washer/dryer. It's very odd becasue my clothes go missing all the time, even if I put them in the right place to be washed/dryed. It's very frustrating as you can imagine.       Well I told myself that I would watch a Disney before it was Voyager time so watch a disney I must. Ta ta!
