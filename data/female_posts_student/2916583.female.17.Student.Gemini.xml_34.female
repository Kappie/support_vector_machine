I've actually written three versions of what I'm about to say...two people have actually made revisions to it, so that I don't sound incredibly bad, or stupid.   The drama, the drama!  High school is all about the drama, and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot.  I've had more DRAMA packed into today than I know what to do with.  I'll start off with one of my famous top five lists - what I wished I knew when I entered high school. 5. "The internet is no place to publish anything you want to be private...that's what the corner of your room is for" -Candy K. 4. If you dislike someone immensely, he/she will automatically assume you're in love with him/her 3. If you profess your dislike of said guy/girl, everyone in the entire school will assume you're in love with him/her 2. If you piss off a rapper, the world will become much clearer cuz at the speed of light he'll spew all the stuff no one wants you to know, but knows. 1. If you write something about someone, there's no way to take it back, unfortunately. Now that that's clear, yeah I found out a lot today.  It's in the form of the good, the bad, the ugly, and the hideous.  The good - the pissed off rapper will forgive you if you eradicate all mentions that could get you in trouble, and apologize for the world to see (see bottom).  The bad - Alex has been reading this since I started it...insert foot in mouth at this point.  The ugly - EVERYONE knew about this, except me...apparently, it's FUNNY to let someone go on and on while the person at whom venting is directed knows all your inner thoughts...jam foot into esophagus.  The hideous - the reason why I have so many people reading is because I have a publicist I didn't know about - Alex.  At least ten people have told me that he was the one that told them about the site...look up a surgeon to remove foot from stomach. What's worse - I feel like a jackass, cause he would never have known about it had I not left my freakin journal up for the world to see after fourth period...that's when some "sources" of my venting read it.  Now do you understand why I'm being careful with wording?  In my first draft, I included apologies to everyone I mentioned.  In the second draft, I just had fifty million "I'm sorrys" for Cory.  The third...I'm writing it on a whim.   Well I think that I need to work on my rough draft, then hit the gym around 6:30 to pound all my frustration and naivety into the crosstrainer and all my other favorites. (On a Friday?  That's real smart).  Now I'm going to go through all my entries with a fine-toothed comb and remove names...I'm leaving in all references to everyone's favorite joke, cause otherwise I'd have no journal.  Hey, if you see me at the gym and have more drama for me, by all means, tell me cause I haven't learned about any shockers lately, so the feeling of incredible stupidity is wearing off.      To Cory - I know you are probably going WHAT??? right now cause this isn't what you looked at, but that was just too mushy.  So this one's gonna be real.  Right now, there aren't enough "I'm sorry"s in the world to say how bad I feel about everything.  If I had a clue that Kim and Alex were reading this, I would have never, ever said anything (oh, yeah, Kim, if you're reading this, I'm sorry about everything that happened...if you've got the time, talk to me sometime so I can do a decent apology).  Wow, if you had told me two days ago that I would be apologizing to one of my oldest friends about a rap, I would have just shook my head and smiled, but I'm apologizing now, and I really hope you can accept it.  By the way, I'm leaving in the part about the battling, just like you suggested.  One more thing - I guess we're even, cause I kinda have to forgive you for calling me Nicholean for nine years, and I'm hoping you'll forgive and forget about this whole ugly incident. You know, I think this is the most sarcastic entry yet (other than the apologies, which I sincerely meant).  I have no apologies for what I said about Alex, cause everything I said I meant, and while I have regrets for going into so much detail (especially about Key Club), the only thing I'd change about this whole ordeal is that I would have liked to know sooner (gee thanx chemistry class, English class, math analysis, and journalism), so I could look like less of an ass, I understand why people kept the secret, cause I think that I probably would have done the same (even though I'm royally screwed, and things are going to be supremely awkward around him until graduation).  Later.
