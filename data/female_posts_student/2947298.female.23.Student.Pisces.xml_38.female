I've dated two people and it truly ruined everything because they were insecure that I had more money than them. It makes no sense to me why a woman is put down when she is successful! I don't even have an actual job yet, so what's the deal? You should be happy for your partner that they are doing well and support them in whatever they do, regardless if it makes money or not. It's always okay if your a struggling artist, but a female successful artist will have trouble finding a man because of their stupid insecurities. If you let money ruin your love you will never find actual happiness. And I have found the best quote from  urlLink South Park :  "Love isn't a decision. It's a feeling. If we could choose who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical."  -Mr. Twig   urlLink How to Travel Like a Billionare  I found this article to be very cool! A day after I found  urlLink Sky Jet . I would love to travel like this and would probably be the only way I will get on a plane in the near future aside from going to a hypnotise.   Personal:  Recently I have been having the best time! Cirque du Soeil was excellent! I love the  urlLink Aerial Act , they were so hot!!! I also found the restaurant we ate at ( urlLink Da Ciro ! Everything that day was just great, except for the horrible cuts on my foot my great looking sandals made. But damn I looked good! We even have  urlLink pictures !  I also went  urlLink hiking  with Ross yesterday. We had a picnic by the water fall and got lost, but it was just such a nice day and so beautiful there we didn't much care. When we got back Ross bought me  urlLink Gerbera Daisies , my second favorite flower! It is actually equal to Roses, it depends on the season and these were just to nice to pass up! Such vibrant colors they just scream happy!  Soon we will be going to OBX (Outter Banks, NC).  My Uncle Rob has a count down on  urlLink his site ! From today it is 58 Days!!! Everyone is on a diet to look great on that beach, but we will still be that pale white family you see. Can't change genetics... but who cares I will be in OBX and you won't!  The poll is still out  urlLink Would You Date Me?  I have added a few answers to it so that it's funnier to me! So cast your vote!  Well back to the usual now that I am done babysitting. Looking forward to July 4th, that firework festival of explosions! Not looking forward to summer classes and summer work. But I get super student next semester! Yay me. I think it has something to do with the fact I am the only person who has worked there over a semester! But who cares! YAY ME!!! I get tuition paid with it and well I also did excellent last semester grade wise, 2 A's and 3 B's. Although I think one of those B's should be an A I did great considering the jerks off professors I had for most of the semester. Hope this new thing won't kill me or my grades. My problem with this job is I care to much about the computer problems there for personalizing them and driving myself crazy with things I can't fix. But I still like it and you can not beat the 5 minute commute.   My Job is:  Student computer aids are available during their work hours to help students and faculty with basic computer needs. In addition, they will be monitoring computer labs and learning about software and hardware.  Computer aids are Macintosh friendly, have a good attitude, and are comfortable assisting faculty.
