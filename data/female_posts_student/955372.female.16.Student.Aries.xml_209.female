So i get out of the shower and i hear these guys like talking and moving matresses about. So i'm standing in the bathroom in my robe and i try to open the door but the matress is like in the way. I don't know why they just left it in the hallway but HEY whatever. Yeah so then i was like, i guess i'll wait here. Yeah so then i get out of the bathroom and i go into my room (the guys had already left) and then i see the matress and its HUGE!!! You can't even see the foot of my bed its so montrous. It's bad. hahaha oh well.
