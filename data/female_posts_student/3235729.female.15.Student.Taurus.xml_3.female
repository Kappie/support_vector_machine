You don't even want to  begin  to know, but this being my blog, I am going to tell you, seeing as it is a topic chock full of bloggedy goodness. (This is going to be one hell of a blog! Like...57 pounds of blog in a 3 pound bag. That's a lot of blog. Not ooglay though...) Alright, where to begin?! Let's start at the beginning (Idealy, anyhow...) So, we got out at 2:15 yesterday because it was the last Tuesday of the month and I roped Lindsay into coming to my house to hang out and get ready for the concert. We were still in a state of shock. We couldn't believe it was finally the big night. 55 days, and it's finally here! Anywho, so I changed my clothes because I was wearing sweatpants (I knew that I was going to be sweating tons and bathing in 12 other people's sweat, so the last thing I wanted to be wearing was SWEATPANTS.) and we got ready. Then we decided we were hungry. So we grabbed some doritos, sat down in my room and put in a Distillers cd to generally get us pumped (moreso, anyway) until my mom wanted to drive us there. We left at about 5:20, and got there close to 6:00. A few punks in there, not too many. We sat down on one of these circle bench thingers. We had brought little Kool-Aid pouches, and Lindsay takes hers out and just chugs it down. Then we decided to go wait in line for the concert. Me, being the very COOL person that I am, take out my Kool-Aid pouch while we were standing in line, just standing there and drinking it. Good times getting stares! And this, my friends, is JUST where the good times begin. So we finally get in, and Lindsay and I bolt down the stairs and into the place where the concert was. We started out in the 2nd row from the gate, which is a pretty damn good view of the stage. I may as well have been in the front row because I saw between buddy with the braids, and Igor's girlfriend's heads (I will explain all in due course) and I think Lindsay generally had a good view (besides when igor was shaking his ass at her AHAHA...I'm not even going to explain that one to you...). Anywho. Igor is, most simple put (and this is a long story so  try   to understand because this blog is going to be long enough without the story of Igor) is Igor For Hair. Meaning he's bald. And his girlfriend is simply the chick he was with. (They were both fat and ooglay) and buddy with the braids is this hardcore guy that stood beside me talking to me, and he had obeasty bracelets and chains and...braids. And my mom made a friend (Hey Lindsay!) She just sat at a table...while we moshed away. And...my mom is a bad bad man. She talked to (well kinda) one of the band members of the Distillers. Well, he more or less asked her where the band members go whilst she was outside smoking. Anywho, so the concert starts. We knew that Distillers wasn't going to play first because they were with Crowned King and we knew this. So the band starts to play, and it was all SO FUCKING LOUD. There were like at least 12 amps. Ah hell, hearing's overrated anyway. Now this band sucked. Not so much the instruments (debatable) as so much the vocalist. (That savage guitarist that broke the string was kickass though hey Lindsay??!) The vocalist...you couldn't even hear him. Apparently this  wasn't  Crowned King. I didn't know this until Crowned King came onto the stage. I looked at Lindsay after the 2nd band came on (I thought there were only 2 bands: Crowned King and Distillers) and I was like "What the hell who are these people?" "Oh this is Crowned King." "No It can't be! Who was the band before?" Then buddy with the braids turns around and he's like "No, this is Crowned King. They're Ska, but they're good. Don't worry about it." I just took his word for it. So apparently buddy with the braids was all into Crowned King. In between taking 80,000,000 pictures he was either moshing or screaming the lyrics, making me smell his hair (I was standing behind him). Yeah...and then buddy from Crowned King (after he was finished throwing the microphone stand around and jumping and flailing about like he was on fire) jumps into the crowd, and is like 5 inches away from kicking me in the head. It was awesome. And he has his belly button pierced! lmao! This was all shortly before crowd surfers started to, well, surf the crowd. Half the time they were falling and/or kicking me in the head. I would either punch them as they got pulled off the crowd by security or I'd stab them with my spikey bracelet. (And some chick lost her phone and they were just kicking it around...I felt kinda bad for her. I was so paranoid after that about losing my phone) So Crowned King is playing like their last song, and the chick in front of me decides she wants to leave. SCORE! I get front row centre. Right in the middle of the fucking pit. So, this was right before Distillers came onto the stage. As soon as they did, all Hell. Broke. Loose. I was almost insantly practically plastered against the gate in front of me, which didn't hurt that much at the time, but does now. People were constantly jumping on me or elbowing me or kicking me. I'd either stab them with my bracelet or bite them if possible. And even worse  everyone  was trying to squeeze into front row, and there's a simple rule, or a guide, if you will. DON'T TRY TO SQUEEZE YOURSELF INTO A 25 PERSON SPACE WHEN THERE'S ALREADY 30 PEOPLE THERE. It was  so  annoying. And about 4 songs into Distiller's show, Lindsay gets thrashed out of her spot by me and almost gets pushed into the circle pit. Yeah that concert was good time ALL AROUND. Best night of my life. 5.5 hours of NO rap, NO country, NO poser punk...just good ol' punk rock! And then after the concert I bought a zip-up sweater with a "D" on the front and "The Distillers" written on the back with a picture of a naked lady who is bleeding on it (this is their album cover, for "Coral Fang") then I went to the bathroom and pissed for a very very long time. I had to piss before we left for the Distillers, so my bladder was about to explode. I end this segment of my blog with one bit of advice: Don't go to concerts if you're clausterphobic. (I'm not clausterphobic, just a piece of advice). Because you've got people leaning on your shoulders and putting their elbows on your shoulders (apparently I'm the "perfect height") that you don't even know. And I was SO FUCKING SWEATY AFTER. IT WAS SO GROSS. But yeah, I guess my "last piece of advice" thing didn't work out according to plan. So, yeah, don't go to concerts if you're clausterphobic.  So school today...nothing happened really...the usual...cubbyness, I fell asleep in 2nd and 5th...yeah I don't know...pretty slack! And I don't have to go to school all day tomorrow because I have to go for an MRI for my headaches.  But yeah I've run out of bloggedy goodness and topics of that nature, so...later.   -Joebie
