It is a chart of all the women I have slept with, and where they fall as far as sex:  good ---> bad and intimacy, intimate --------> not.  It cracked me up.  I had forgotten I had even done it.  I might reproduce it and post it.  Yeah.  Guess I am a geek.  I also forgot that I had kissed a guy in Wales.  Oops.  Funny, that.  Well, it wasn't a very good kiss.  I wonder what those charts are called.  The ones with four quadrants, and  you track two variables with them.  Hrm.  Well, I just have two more finals tomorrow and then I am finished with my academic career.  I got a C in dodge ball class, though.  Well, whatever.  I hated that class.  I might just drop by to find out how he calculated it.  But I'm not sure I care that much.  Hopefully, this semester won't tank my chances at graduate school.  But if it does, oh well.  I did decently well on my GRE, so that will have to do.
