It was fun for awhile then my sister made us play Scene It until 2 in the morning (that's late for us).  Then we were gonna take weird pictures of us being stupid, but that didn't work out too well because we started watching Young Frankenstein.  Then we stopped so I could come over here and tell everyone what we did because I didn't have anything else to write about.  Oh, we watch Win a Date with Tad Hamilton.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it'd be.  I actually liked it (I can't believe I just admitted that).  If we end up taking stupid pictures of ourselves, I might put them on here.  I need to get out of this house.  I hope it rains (random moment go me!).  I want to go outside and do something weird, but there's nothing to do.  You just can't plan to do something stupid, you know.  I can't believe it's summer and no one is online.  It's not like they have lives.  Wait, that's just me that doesn't have a life.
