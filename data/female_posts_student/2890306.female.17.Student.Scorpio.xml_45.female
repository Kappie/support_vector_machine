Nevertheless, I'll let my harmless little blog snatch me away from my duties yet another time.  Also, a very jolly hello to Miss Stephanie Tschetter because I know she's reading this and squeaking at the fact I mentioned her in here.  *waves to Steph*  Today hasn't been the greatest.  Things started out all right, but then I had a bad time at work which made things go completely downhill.  Everyone has those kinds of days.  I probably shouldn't worry about it so much.    A morbid topic came to my mind earlier in the day.  What would it be like if I died?  Have you ever thought that to yourself?  I mean, don't take it the wrong way.  The question wasn't one out of depression, but rather a strange curiousity.  What would it be like if I died and watched over my funeral?  What would I see?  More importantly, who?  I wondered if a life is only worth the amount of collective tears shed at the funeral.  It is a sad thing to wonder, yet I did.  Sometimes, I wonder about this very strongly, and wish I could experience it.  I would want the experience to be reversible, but able to be remembered.  He'll probably get angry at me for saying this, but sometimes I wonder (and I don't know why) what my boyfriend would do if I were watching over as a ghost.  And my family.  Would they be hunched over in tears?  Would I see my brother, for the first time, cry?  Would they all smile at some point, lost in a memory of me?  This whole idea either sounds completely narcissistic to you or you've felt it yourself.  Maybe I'm not the only one who is morbidly curious.  I really shouldn't be writing this.
