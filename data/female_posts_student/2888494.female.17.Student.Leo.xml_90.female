Today I’m going to church with Carter, then I plan to proceed to attend my church as usual, which means I’ll be at church for 7 hours today (I kid you not- I’ll be with Carter from 10.00 to 1.00, then I will be at my church from 1.00 to 4.00, and then I’ll be at a leadership meeting until 5.30, so in all actuality I will attend church for 7.5 hours today) If I O.D on veneration, send in a recovery mission and retrieve me.
