Exactly how pathetically retarded is my life??  Tomorrow I'm going to hang out with Nikol, Ned, Trast, Ayden, Laya, Day, and Erra.  Someone mentioned fishing.  I plan to watch.  I used to fish with my dad a lot when I was a kid.  When my brothers were at band or football practice, I was with him.  It was cool.  I was thinking about taking the video camera up with me, the kids would have fun with that.  They could make their own little television show.  That was fun for Tammy, Tracy and me.   It was called the Shitcom Show.  It wasn't a sitcom, more like a talk show.  We had Robin and Bobby as our featured guests.  And we were shooting live on location from Tammy and Robin's kitchen.  How cool were we!!!  I'd love to say that this was when we were around 7 or 8, but the truth of the matter is, it was about 5 or 6 months ago.  Them were the days.  I wish I had not-so-much to worry about.  Why is it so hard for someone to live alone and have what they want.  All I want is a nice apartment with soft carpeting and sound proof walls, a decent car, a job that pays well without me having to work 40 hours or more a week.  This really sucks.  Sometimes I wish my dad hadn't left the military.  It would have been cool living in different countries.  I wonder how I would have turned out.   Bottom line, I hate my job.
