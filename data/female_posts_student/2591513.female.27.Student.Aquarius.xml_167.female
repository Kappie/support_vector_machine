It was nice being around the fmaily.  I think it was restful in between Nalani and Bailey's fights.  I am pretty sure my sisters had a great time at the wedding.  I am sure theya re going to have some cool stories.  I am glad that they still have friends up there...it is nice to see that most of their circle have either kept in touch or are still pretty close even if they don't talk as much.  They are lucky.  My friends and I are far too different these days and it is sad, but I think the healthiest.  Never hold onto something that isn't there.  One day we will fall back on our roots and I am sure that we will pick things up.  Sometimes friendships are like that...or so I am told.  Goodnite loyal readers.
