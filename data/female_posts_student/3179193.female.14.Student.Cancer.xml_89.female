His name is actually Chris but Ingrid calls him Chrissy... blah! LoLzZ~! HahazZ~! They had their "guy talk" so I put down the phone for a while. Chrissy was asking him something like how far we've gone or whatever...? Haha! Weirdo Chris. Well I'm happy for him! He got dumped but at least he's with Becca now~   It's partly cloudy tomorrow so blah! At least it's not rainy~ Hee hee! Invited Candace and Roger, but Candace couldn't come so I didn't bother asking Roger. Alice didn't give an answer as to whether her and Safee are coming. -O-" Blahness!   Mark and Vivo are at Nima's place right now. Blah... watching a movie or whatever? Blah! I'm bored outta my mind! -O-" Chinese EXAM on Saturday! Dammnn~ Nooo! Fuck... ahh!  So bored... Don't feel like blogging... maybe blog later.
