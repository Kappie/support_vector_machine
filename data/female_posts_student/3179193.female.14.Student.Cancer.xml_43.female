But yeah... he came at lunch time so that was good. Got home and microwaved some Shepherd's Pie. Home alone with sister so I'm not going to Bethel tonight. Can't leave her all alone at home. So here I am: in front of the computer, sipping lemon tea. I'm so bored.   I talked to Ioana about the contest today at school and we've gotten Roger to join our group to try out for the thing. I want to try really hard on this. *sighzZ* Blah.  Going to PCW tomorrow. Driving Alice and Nima. Mark got a ride from somebody. So yeah... we'll arrive a little bit late because Alice doesn't have a season pass and she's gonna get a one-day ticket so that's cool.  Talked to Alice at recess today and it was... interesting. I didn't know what to say but I learned a lot from this. So yeah. Keeping all my friends in my prayers.  I haven't posted on SD for a while. I'm just gonna post here from now one unless something major happens. I'm not posting on my personal personal one either. Haha...  Oh yeah, we had a Sudbury meeting today in the library and yeah... Rodway, Sandiford, Cruickshank, McDaid, Mann, and Oberoi. Why isn't Tsokas coming? He's funny! Haha! Most important thing is that Nima's there. Hee hee~ So yeah. Rodway's (my) class is getting split on the busses. Damn. Julie and I wanted to trade 'cos she wanted to be with Rach and Delia and I wanted to go with Nima. Haha! So we talked to Rodway even though Sandiford said no trading. Rodway talked to us after school and she's gonna see what she can do. GO RODWAY! DON'T LET SANDIFORD STEAL YOUR WIND! Haha! Jokes~ But yeah... I hope we'll be able to switch. Rodway wrote down that Julie wanted to trade because she "didn't have any friends" on Bus B. I saw her write down "(Nima)" beside my name as the reason and I'm like *blush*! Haha! She did NOT have to write that down! But yeah... It was really weird. Blah. It was funny though. I guess she isn't as bad as I though. Rodway I mean. After that blow-up with Julie and I, she seems to be a bit nicer to the both of us.  *sighzZ* Boredom... I'm gonna DIE~ Gonna download some more songs on Kazaa Lite and listen to music... Tired from playing guitar yesterday... fingers throbbing.   I miss Nima. *sighzZ* He's so... Nima. (its a good thing) Perfect guy. Everything about him is PERFECT :) Ashegetam.
