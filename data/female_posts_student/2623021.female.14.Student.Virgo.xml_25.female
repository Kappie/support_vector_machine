It's all so much fun! We are going to have a bon fire tonight I believe... if I can go. Maia and I have been talking alot lately, it's a lot of fun. She's in Portland which sucks, her dad wants her to move there for all of the summer and all of next year which would SUCK. She's a lot of fun! Suzy needs to bring her duck or turtle out tonight, they are so cute :) But ya know. Wow a dead girl on TV imagine that, it seems that is all that is on TV lately... murders, crimes, sex.   SEX DRUGS  ALCOHOL... THEY ARE BAD!    Things are so weird lately. Ashlyn is basically in love (well really strong lust) with a guy, Fel and Wit... Juju and Josh.. Shelly and the other Josh... and Suzy and I don't have or like anyone (well I dont really like anyone...) but well... haha nevermind. Summer is the time to relax, Summer is the time to hang out, Summer is the time to have fun in the sun and get laid in the shade JK :P (sorta) Ciao
