When I got up this morning, my mom made me French toast for a special breakfast and she put a birthday candle in each piece and sang Happy Birthday to me and made me blow out the candles.  It was tres cute.  Meliss and Carolyn made me signs for my locker so I felt soooo special and everybody knew it was my birthday and said Happy Birthday randomly, even if I hadn't told them, but b/c they had seen the signs, which was a little weird but perfectly acceptable :-).  In French somebody (Jacqui?) told Mme Sanfacon that it was my birthday so then the whole class sang "Joyeuse Anniversaire" and that was cool.  In math I didn't have to take the last quiz since I had gotten 30/30 on all of the previous ones, so that was an added bonus.  I had gym long block which was pretty bad.  We played basketball and soccer, neither of which I am too good at.  It was pretty boring to be honest.   Then I had lunch, which was long and uneventful and had a gross apple (random). English last=Animal Farm quiz that I think I got 100 on.  woot woot.  *leaves to check on cookies in oven* o.k. back.  Yes, good cookies, but could have possibly been cooked a little less.  So, then on the bus, I was sort of nervous we were going to have to walk home in the pouring rain, which really would have stunk, but we ended up getting a ride so that was fantabulous.  So, after that I hung out with myself (fun stuff) and listened to the message Sar left me on the answering machine which made me happy and read some more of the driver's manuel so I can get my permit soon.  And listened to John Mayer.  But I do that everyday.  So, now I am trying to figure out where we shall go out to eat tonight in celebration of this lovely day.  And then hopefully come home and get some lovely gift-age.  I really really hope I get the green mini ipod I've been in love with for months, but they don't seem to have had them in any stores, so I'm not sure if I'll get one tonight.  But I will sometime around now. OK going to do more lazy birthday things and I shall update y'all later on my gift-age and such.
