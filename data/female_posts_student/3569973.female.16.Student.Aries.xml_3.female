And Im starting to wish that I was back in school, because its become where summer is worse than school. I mean tomorrow Im gonna be working 14 HOURS!! How crazy is that. I mean I feel like Im 10 years old except with two jobs. I mean I had more freedom when I was 13 then I do now. I cant stay out past 9:30 on the week days or 11:00 on Friday and Saturday. Meaning I will NEVER get to see Jake again. Well for a long amount of time anyways. Because both Friday and Saturday Ill be at work till about 10:30 EVERY Friday and Saturday. Meaning more than likey no football games, but they might as well just not be open on Fridays during football season, cause everyone in Alvarado will be at the freakin football game. So now that I got a freakin job I have to break a couple of promises to someone that I care about. It really really really pisses me off that I had more freedom during school than during the summer. It also pisses me off that my WHOLE summer gets taken away from me...because they're forcing me to be grown up and Im only 16 FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!! JUST 16!! Ive already got enough stress to last me for the next two years while I have to stay here....I dont think Im gonna make here. Expecially when I have to be home at 9:30...say good bye to parties, or going out, just about anything. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE.
