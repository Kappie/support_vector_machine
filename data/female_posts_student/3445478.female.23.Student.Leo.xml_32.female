I knew he was getting off work early and thought he would come to Duluth to surprise me and Nick and he called pretending to be in the cities still. I had just woken up from a 10 min nap and was out of it. I bought the story and hung up promptly because I was so sad he wasn't here. I climbed back into bed to continue my nap with Nick. I really thought he'd come up to Duluth. 20 minutes later I hear someone mowing our lawn-I jump up and guess what...YEP!!!!! Shawn's Home!!!!!!! He drove up for 14 hours and now we all are heading back to the cities for Brooke's baby shower. What a husband!!! He's the best!!!
