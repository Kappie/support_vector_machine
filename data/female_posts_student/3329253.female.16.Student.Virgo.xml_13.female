Bummer hey? Wow that last sentence was a run on sentence... Good moove Donna.So yeh I'm sitting here not mooving really except my fingers and I am incredibly bored to bits.I just filled up my waterbottle though outside the clouds are mooving and its making things all cool.       I hope it rains tonight. Moo. It'll be good if the clouds do moove in with some mooving rains tonight. Not epic rains of torture, but rain would be good. Oh look, the air is mooving now. That makes wind doesn't it. Anyway this isn't mooving anywhere so I'm gonna go moove some where else. Maybe in front of the mooving air coming in from the window.
