(kentesheia, i will tell you the story too).   right now, i'm emailing my dad, hoping he can hook me up at exxonmobil's communication department. i was looking on thier website and not only do they have summer internships, they have summer JOBS as well... whichever pays more, huh?  that's just another star in the sky i'll wish upon today...  regardless, it's a start. there's lots of people in houston who would love to have a nice little grad student intern with them (i hope).  after i left her office i headed here to the library... there's been this preacher in the free speach area all this week, and i heard him talking about the passion as i walked by... and seeing as how i am was headed to do research on it in the first place, i thought it would be a nice idea to take a seat and listen to what he had to say.  i think i missed the begining, i was kinda lost.  but then he got onto evolution, and genetics, and i heard dna thrown around a few times, and the word ameoba was popular... but i lost interest and continued on my walk to the library.  so i find things on the passion. good. hopefully this ball will get rolling soon...  but then i forget my wallet in the car. so i talk to my car (i park off campus too, remember this), and i decide i'd go to the bank and deposit my check (yay for checks). so i come back, park in the same spot which i thought was awesome, and get my  books and head to check out. and wouldn't you know it i left my id in my pocket from the rec last night. damn it. :) they're going to hold them for me until tomorrow...  so here i am, bookless and craving a diet coke with lime like you wouldn't beleive.   but international relations doesn't start for another hour, so i'm going to go do some reading before lecture starts.  three blogs in a day, yipee.  love you all. bye :)
