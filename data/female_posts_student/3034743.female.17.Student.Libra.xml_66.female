Today I took a practice SAT out of this book I have, and I only got a 1150 on it. My goal is to get around a 1300-1400 on the actual test, so I should study/practice some more. I don't really have too much to blog about. Today I watched Big Fish, and that was good.  I'm only blogging for Chubbs because I know she gets mad when I don't. Well, that is really about it. I'll blog later.
