I accept mediocrity, in fact I root for the underdog, not to beat the odds, but rather becuase, well....someone's gotta root for 'em.    Anyhow, the Jets season is over 'cause the great white hype, Chad Pennington, broke his hand preseason so we're stuck with Vinny QB-ing and I personally have no hand eye coordination, but am a better QB.  NOW the f'n Rangers have lost Pavel Burre pretty much permanently due to knee injuries and Leetch is also out this season AND the deal fell thru for Jagr so again we get the shaft.  What I don't understand though is this: last year the roster on paper for the Rangers looked  absolutely unstoppable and they still sucked balls.  What the hell, yo?  Rar.
