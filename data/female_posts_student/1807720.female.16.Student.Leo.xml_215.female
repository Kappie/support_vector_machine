Now I understand why I lack confidence half and the time and doubt myself.  Over and over my dad kept saying "You guys are so stupid" to me and my mother.  Now I remember why I lack confidence in things like Math.  I remember I used to ask him how to do things and then if I didn't understand he would get upset with me.  I kept thinking in my head this morning: I wish my parents would divorce.  I felt so strongly like that this morning.  It made me want to cry just listening to them go at it, and there I was right in the middle of it.  The argument didn't even have anything to do with me, yet my Dad put it as "you guys are so stupid."  I mean sometimes my parents are fine, but old age has turned my Dad into Mr. Grumpy.  I don't like it.  That is not the person I know or thought I knew.  Anyways, despite that we picked up Megz and went to Stampede.  We walked around inside and checked out the art exibits and all the both things.  We also pretended to be really interested in products so we got tons of free samples.  Then we got pizza and mini-donuts.  I don't even want to think about how much fat were in those, but they were good and I don't eat those everyday.  Then we went to the Rodeo which was pretty excited.  Except I am not really into bull-bustin or any of that stuff.  The barrel racing was pretty exciting.  I have to admit that my favourite parts were before the Rodeo when the Stampede Showband performed, during the Indian Hoop Dance, and part of the show where the rodeo clown dressed up as if he came from different eras: 70's, 80's, 90's and it was really funny.  To say the least all the non-related Rodeo things were my favourite, lol.  It wasn't that bad though, it was pretty entertaining.  Then later on we went for dinner and then Megz and I went to those boths where u get old fashioned picks and we dressed up like the older days and got a pic taken like that.  It is sooooooooooo hilarious.  My Mom was killing herself laughing.  Then we went to see a whole bunch of animals and stuff and that was about it.  When I got home I had to work on my position paper for social 30.  We get Monday's class to write it, but I wanted to get a head start.  Here's that picture we got taken at the Stampede today.  And by the way that outfit makes me look fat, my stomach is NOT that big.  It is a misleading misconception.  Anyways, still looking good!  lol ;)
