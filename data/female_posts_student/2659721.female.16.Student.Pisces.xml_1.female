I warn you now, I'm nasty, opinionated, sarcastic and critical, and most of what I say makes little or no sense. But that's just me. Sorry.   Mood;Annoyed Listening: When the Levee Breaks - Led Zeppelin  I am ANNOYED. Why, perhaps you ask? Well, OK, you probably don't ask, but it makes for a better introduction than 'I am annoyed because'. Anyway, the reason for my annoyed mood is that I am expected to like the bands my friends like, hate the bands my friends hate and bitch about these bands. I like McFly and Busted. Is that a crime? I'm not alone, I know that much. Just because I don't like pop music in general doesn't mean I can't like these bands; they aren't like normal pop. These guys write and play their own songs, and are pretty damn cute into the bargain. So they aren't Led Zeppelin, but they're still nice,talented people who don't deserve to be vilified by people whose closest brush with fame so far has been a small part in an Offenbach musical. Clearly that qualifies one to pass judgement over a famous band.   Yesterday I joined McFly's street team, but I can't take part in many of the missions that most members do, because I'll be ridiculed for the rest of my life. I'm not exactly popular already. I know you shouldn't care what others think, but when you're a teenager and you have to mix with these people every day it's not as easy as all that. Why can't we all just be able to be individuals? Life is about choices, and we shouldn't have to make the choices our friends want us to make; we should be able to make the choices WE want to make. It's a small thing, but it really irritates me. Like mosquitoes.   Today I've been revising, because my GCSEs start in earnest in a couple of weeks' time, and I'm panicking. There's so much stuff to learn, and once I learn one concept, everything else just seems to leave my head. It's as though my brain can only hold one idea at a time. It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have so many in such a short space of time, and so many in general. I have 23 exams in total - that's a lot of revision. And I'm not getting very far. Never mind; what will be will be, whether I like it or not. Oh well. I'm going to try and contact the most gorgeous guy in the world now. Goodbye.  p.s.:New McFly single Obviously: out June 21st! It's really cool! Buy it! Trust me, I love Led Zep so I have high standards!
