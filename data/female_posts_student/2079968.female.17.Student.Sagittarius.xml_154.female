I was barely tall enough to ride alone. Oh, you have license to make fun of my hat if you'd want. I was just having a terrible hair day. I inherited the hat from my mom...she used to wear it back in the day.    Uhh...no kiddin' buddy.    Just HOW forbidden are these caverns if they have giant billboards advertising them? Oh, check out the "Elvis and Friends" billboard, too. How cheesy.    View from the cabin. It was pretty hazy that day...but still a lovely view.    One of my cousins. He looks like The Thinker. I like it.    Squirrel that terrorizes my house.    I met the Colonel! I chose the small version because I hate the big one. I look weird in it. I was tired and still sick that day. But, it was an amusing photo, I think.  That'll do for now.
