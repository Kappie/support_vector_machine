And i have pretty much nothing to write about. I'm bored, I'm tired, I hate school, I'm glad I don't have piano lessons tomorrow, because i haven't practiced, I miss my dog (she's at my house now) I miss my other dog (he's at my house too). I GOT MY A7x BOARD MEMBERS DVD TODAY AND THAT MAKES ME VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME!!! I like Shadows' voice- his singing voice is amazing, but i mean his talking voice. It's kind of stressed sounding, you can tell he puts a lot into his voice when he's singing/screaming. I wish Zacky and Johnny got to talk more though. :'(
