We went to this yummy bento place by PSU. I got teryaki chicken and STICKY RICE! The rice was SO gooood! I wuv rice.  Then we went to 23rd and looked around. We went to urban outfitters and I got this awesome shirt for Beka!!! It says "Mini-Van, Mega Fun!" and it has a picture of a mini van on it. It rocks!! Then, for me, I got this great shirt that says "Have Fun. Be Fit. Aerobicize!!" it's great. It has this fun-knee picture of this workout lady. Haha. I finally found something to ask for fur my birthday!! My mom keeps bugging me about what to get me for my birthday. I told her to get me this awesome hat. It's kinda hard to explain. But it's cool. And, I will be able to wear it to school because hats are not against the dress code anymore!! Mwa haha!  Then we just kinda wandered for awhile. Ohh wait! We went to three monkeys. I don't usually like anything at that store. it's all kinda cheaply made..but today I found an awesome messenger bag!! I got it for school! Its pretty. I should take a picture of it.  Then we went downtown and wandered more. Then we went to whole foods and got some..well..foood! Yay!  And that was the end of my shopping trip.   Funnnn stuff.  Now I am home and my sister is bound to be back from camp any minute. Sad. Oh well.
