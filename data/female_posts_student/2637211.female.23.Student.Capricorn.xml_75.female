And I hate writing a history paper with literature. I get my tenses all confused. What's wrong with a history book? If I'd wanted to write lit papers, I'd be an English major, dammit. Poop. I feel so exasperated with myself and my teachers, and I hate being creative. *sigh* It's okay, I just need to be calm and write... since Jerm isn't here to vent at, I decided I needed to vent here, I promise, as soon as papers are done I be witty and clever again. If I ever was.
