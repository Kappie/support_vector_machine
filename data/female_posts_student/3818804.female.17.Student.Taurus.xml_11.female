"Get up it's time to work!" I wake up my back hurts and I don't know what going on and I get yelled at....It's so nice to have a nice wake up call. "You're useless" "Why didn't you wake up when we told you to?" "We don't need you go away" "Youmake everything so inconvenient"Those are just some of the nicest comments I've ever heard...I bite the bullet and take the brunt of the bull. Once again my thoughts are put in void and I take the harsh words and try not to cry. So I got to work without "pay" and sweated every second of it. It was so freakin' hot. However, all I have to say to this is I was only 15 minutes late and they act like I missed the whole gravy train.    My mother said she had been wanting to go to Macy's for the past couple of days an so she decides to go today. She says "Me and Jennifer will go to Macy's. Julia will stay home" It's cool whatever make a big deal out of nothing and rub it in my face. As if I don't feel like an outsider in the family anyways just make me feel more uncomfortable. Like I said before, you think you know, but you have no idea. Our family looks all happy go lucky but it's not...just like lots of other families. And after the ranting and raving about my inconvenience to the family they act like nothing happened and we're all cool with each other. I FUCKIN' HATE THAT!    On a happier note their happy go lucky vibes pay off. I got to go to Macy's...lolz. I also got a new phone! A camera one! lol...I was happy and then of course someone has to ruin it. We get in the car and my mother gives the speech she gives all the time after we get something. "You guys have to work hard yadda yadda esp. you Julia"  wtf?   WHATEVER!        *sigh*  There are so many incidents and so many thought that come to mind that I couldn't possibly type the amount of pain that I have when she talks about how useless I am. It actually hurts, inside, in my heart.    Anyways....I sound like a sad child...I just have my days as we all do I suppose...    P.S. I got a camera phone!!    P.S.S. I hate my family sometimes and wishI could run away for a day, can I run to you?
