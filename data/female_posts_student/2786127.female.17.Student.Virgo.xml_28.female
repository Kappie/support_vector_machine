I still feel like i'm forgetting a ton of stuff for tommorow....this is WAY more stressful then i wanted it to be. And Matt keeps trying to steal my house key...and i swear to god if he comes in here and wakes me up really early tommorow...let's just say it won't be pretty and i'm pretty sure he won't want to go to prom with me anymore.   I've just decided that i don't want to go camping tommorow night. Its not sounding all that appealing to me right now. bah.   Why am i feeling so stressed out about prom? I don't like this. I think its partially because i'm going in such a big group...i wish i was going with makenzie and lindsay and genie. Instead i have to go with staci and watch her f-ing grind chris all night. SICK. yeah....  Anyways, makenzie and genie and i are going to go to red robin tonight to eat. delicious! and then we'll probably paint nails and such and hang out. I need to de-stress tonight.   Oh. and nate and i are just friends. for now. ... jerk.
