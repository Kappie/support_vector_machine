I'm excited for that, and EMILY COMES HOME in 10 days! I really hope I get to see her before I leave for Whistler, it's been forever!  I got a summer job! At McDonalds. It's actually quite fun there but I suck at till...oh well I'll get used to it!  What am I gonna be doing this summer? Well, not a lot...A LOT of relaxing though! Whistler, Jamee comes to Victoria, Birthday, Working, Tanning....endless possiblilties. Heehee!  Anyways, there isn't a lot to write. I hope I did half decent on my english final, it wasn't too hard.  Luv ya, Lia!
