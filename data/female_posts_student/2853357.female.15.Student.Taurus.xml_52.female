HELL FRIKEN YA! IT HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN AN A! I WORKED HELLA HARD ON THAT ESSAY... the night before  urlLink   ) so now i got time to prepare... lets just hope i dont PROCRASTINATE!  but i dont have to worry about my spanish final (my next final) we got HELLA points extra credit that if i bombed the verbs part of the test, i'd still get AN A+! THATS MORE THAN HALF THE TEST! HELL FREAKEN YA!   and i'm not worried about geometry. its you either know it or you dont. and besides, we get a page of notes...  things are looking up, but i wish i had my humanities final behind me already... thats the killer...   ok, enough puns and references... i got A's to earn...  ta ta~  •patty•
