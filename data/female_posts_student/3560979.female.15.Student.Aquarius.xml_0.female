Even though she knows kids watch and try to mimitate her, she still wears pretty much no clothes. And her latest videos have been pretty sick. All I know is if I had a kid, I wouldn't let him or her even have a BS CD! That's my point of view. Don't like it comment, please comment, I don't even have one measly comment!! But thanks for at least looking at my site!  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                    **Stef**
