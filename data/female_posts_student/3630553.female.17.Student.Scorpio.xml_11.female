Resting my head on a comfy pillow,    I’m thinking again of what’s for tomorrow.    The day was over, and it was all OK,    Yet things were the same as of yesterday.        So, tell me now and let me know,    Will he ever make it to see my show?    Because there's just no way I’d end my story,    Without him standing at the center with me.
