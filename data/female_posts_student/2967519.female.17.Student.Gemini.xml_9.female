We also went out to Dot and Brains house and she is going to start me a pink christmas cactus(my fave) they are soooo pretty and i love them. I think that Jeanettte is comming over this weekend to veg- out and watch movies. I really need to Call you Amanda and i will i promise!Right now i have a major headache and are in desperate need of some pain killers so ill write more tomorrow.
