People drive on the opposite side of the road, the hot and cold water taps are switched, door handles must be turned in the other direction, and there are beautiful women everywhere. The women part may be due to the fact we were in London, but since thats where I was the whole time, I guess we'll never know. I was there for 8 days with my family, and it was alot of fun. We stayed at a hotel in the "West End" of town, in the heart of Londen. Our room was actaully open to the street like a normal apartment though, very cool. The stores there were incredible... there is a whole other society out there for people who have more cash, and it affects everything you do submersely. Thats a blanket statement I won't dive into, its something you have to observe for yourself. Unfortunately you have to go somewhere where there is an upper class to see this, and that excludes most of the country.  We went to Harrod's a few times. This store is a occupies an entire city block and is 8 stories tall... This store has *everything* in it, its like a mini-attraction... there were about 8 seperate clothing departments in it to cater to different styles and money brackets... I won't try to list everything there because I won't do it justice, but lets say I saw 7 foot tall fossils people were buying for their living rooms and a 17,000 dollar miniture Jaguar X Series car for YOUR CHILD.No comment from me.   I also saw a play which was awesome... uh... me and the fam went to dinner twice a day at different restaurants... I saw alot of stuff. The parks they have there are massive, there's horse back riding in them and lawnchairs that the city puts there. We rode one of those double dekka busses the first day on a tour... the Tower of London is actaully more then just a tower, it's a huge fortress spanning from when the Romans first occupied Britian.   We took a day trip out to Stonehenge and to a city called Bath, because of some Roman Baths they found there. The baths were pretty cool, but I thought the town was incredible. The ENTIRE town was designed in the 1700s by Father and Son Architects out of a single type of Stone!! There was so much history there, and everything little nook and cranny had plants growing out of it. The river Avon ran through the middle of the city, and there was a park there in the middle of town with stone fountians and a bunch of school kids putting on a band concert.  We also saw a few Castles... I took a few rolls of everything, I'll scan them and upload all my pictures for you all to see... One thing I wanted to do was to go around by myself and the camera in one of the large London squares at night... but I didn't get around to it :(. I was usually too tired by nightfall to go off by myself.  There were so many handsome girls there, and they all talked in dainty little accents and said cutesy words like "mummsy" and "Spottsy". It was odd because I only saw 3 obese people there the entire time, and we were in the heart of the country! The saturday television was educational... uuuhhh what else... I got called a Gentleman alot by bathroom signs.  I'm glad I went... international travel is so enriching! I want to do more of it. I got alot of experience, alot of mediation was done on my songwriting style and I decided I have to be more brave and raw, im finding ways out of my "wasted potential" mentality which has been sucking me dry from the inside.  For the fourth of july I'm going to the beach with my family, and then to a party I hope hosted by a friend of a friend from Seattle. Still-life is playing on the 9th at a small church, then Eric and I are going to a Spoon concert in Seattle on the 12 I think... I have yet to get ahold of everyone since I've gotten back.
