I missed having his arms around me while I fell asleep and then waking up next to him. So this morning when I woke up, I was saddened, because he wasn't there, I am back home and it sucks. I wanted to start crying, but I knew if I did, I don't think I'd be able to stop. It's just that I don't feel like I belong here, I just want to be with him again and it's hard to get used to him not being around...   I just wanna hold you close  But so far all I have a dreams of you
