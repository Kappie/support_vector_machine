I needed to let go of myself  really  badly from all the stress. i shan't elaborate since it isn't necessary, hence, last night when i met  nora sweetheart  online, we decided to hang out today and have some gurly fun.  I took a cab to town then met her at 10.15am. we took stickers prints from 2 different machines at the annexe. 8 beam and this other new hee-uge machine. it's so model-like and seemed sophisticated. and in one of the snapshots i carried her! and she was really amazed by my sheer strength. anyhow, we bought tix to catch  charlies angels: full throttle  at 11am in cineleisure.. =P  it was soooo awesome ya!!  it  really  kicked butt. we were yakking all about it while we were on our way back to the heeren shops. afterwhich, we took prince machine sticker prints (which is the bessstt haha.) and went window shopping.. cause at that point i have already spent  $50 .. so yeah.. broke  again . waiting for nicco to return me $$ =\\ looked fer' necklaces.. adidas sweaters and a  urlLink ripcurl  sling bag.  nora  and i are gonna buy that sling bag together! hopefully by the time we save up...it's still being sold =D  dang.. we fell madly in love with it upon setting our eyes on it. nora and i have minds that are so alike. we keep sayin the same things at the exact same time. haha.   After everything, we proceeded to some mandarin hotel for a seminar.. then we saw  urlLink imran ! haha. it was sooo funny i tell ya. we went in and were strolling around the lobby when nora saw this malay boy in the  SJI  uniform. then she was all "oh my god, is that imran?" and we began freaking out. hahaa.. later she and i hugged each other goodbye.. =) we would be meeting in a month's time. teehee. oh yup, if you're wondering who nora is, well, we met through the help of  BARDOT ! haha. erm, cos we were once crazeee over bardot. then somehow we began chatting over the internet (and she had a website too) and decided to meet up one day. she's one of the many internet peeps i've met up with.. =) and i lub her. she lubs me too! *huggles*   Click below for sticker prints!  urlLink Sticker print 1   urlLink Sticker print 2
