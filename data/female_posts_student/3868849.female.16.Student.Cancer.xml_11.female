Now, on to listening to my music (right now "Waitin' On a Sunny Day" by Bruce Springsteen) But will it work? Only time will tell. As John Ondrasik said when I met him: These are the best days of my life. And its true, but I don't have enough of a life to make anything of it. When school starts, thingh will HAVE to change.. They have to! I have to make a life worth living. If not, I'm going to end up all dried up and mean. I need friends other then over the internet. I mean, my best friend is over 100 miles away, and 10 years older then me. What the hell? I am just soo disappointed in the way my life is turning out. I want a change, I want to get a phone call. I want to go out with friends.. Or **gasp** a guy! I just want something different. And I am happy, I know this, but I want to be  happy  you know? I guess not, I'm talking to a freaking computer! Wow, I am pathetic. I should get out my yearbook, and call someone... But I  HATE  calling people! I don't know why, I just don't like calling people. Another thing I want different. **sigh** I need to go out to the Mills.  I guess the only thing that will cheer my up would be talking about the love of my life: Shawn Knobelock. He is soo amazing. I can't believe that he is in Maryland with the Army. He is gone for 3 months, and I know that I will most likely never see him. But "Even though ending are never ever happy, It's the happy moments along the way, that in the end make it ok" John Ondrasik strikes again! LoL. Gosh, It's already past 1:00am... Weird. But I feel I need to talk about Shawn to cheer me up.. But what memory.. My favorite one was at the home tournment. I was at a table, scoring, and he was next to me. He was the time keeper. He wore a skull cap... susprisingly good on him. He kept hitting me with the towel... oh God, Trapt just came on my LaunchCast radio station.. I'll get to that later.. But anyways, that night, I know he was flirting with me.. Why couldn't I act on it? We might be together now if only I had acted! I'm an idiot, I know. OK, now onto Trapt. Everytime Trapt plays, I want to cry. See, one tournment, Shawn borrowed my CD player to listen to the Self Titled Trapt CD. He had to warm up, so he gave me back my CD player and said "You should listen to it, its an ok CD." So I did, and I loved it. Now, everytime I hear a Trapt song, I think of Shawn.. And I want to cry soo badly! He will NEVER know how much he means to me. I can see myself growing old with him. I can see us with Kids, and everything imaginable... Is it an illusion? It can't be. I cannot believe that. I just pray that I get another one of Shawn's hugs. They are so precious now. I wish I could remember every detail of him. I know that I can't ever forget his ice blue eyes, or his smile, or his laugh, or his smell of his cologne. I could be doing anything, then, just for a split second, I'll smell his cologne, then it will be gone, and I strain to smell it again. And my heart breaks. I cannot help it. Well, It's late, I need to go.  ~~Breena
