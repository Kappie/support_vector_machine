I told her all about this group of people who have been harassing me and trying to upset me, she then stuck up for me. I was upset at first about what she did but I see now that she wants me to be happy and she thought that if she said something to these losers who look down on me, who think they are so much better, maybe they would see that their mean treatment of me is unwarranted. I am happy I have such great friends who would do whatever they can to help me feel better about myself, after all the abuse I put up with over the past year I feel really bad about myself and my life and I cant tell you how many times I just wanted to give up but after last night knowing this time I have made friends who do care.  I now know what I have to do. I have to forget about the insults, threats, the childish behavior, and mean emails. I have to forget these losers and everything they have done because in the long run they will be the ones looked down on as they are nothing special. When they don't have someone to pick on they eventually turn on each other just like they turned on me... I wont be their victim anymore.  I totally believe in karma and if someone is a good person then good things will happen to them, if someone is bad then they will eventually get theirs... I cant wait until they do.
