There were some rather contemptuous girls there, who oddly enough had British accents. I was a bit confused. All good though.   After that I began the walk to the high school. The air was a bit chilled, but the walking was pleasant enough. About 2/3 the way there this purple van pulled over and I saw my friend Mark aka "Shmarky" stick his head out and ask if I would like a ride the rest of the way. I accepted, and then felt bad because now I haven't walked enough. I was grateful of the lift none-the-less.  The concert went well, everyone performed well. One soloist went a little bit too freestyle, however, and it wasn't his best idea ever.   Hmmm, foot is asleep again.  After the concert, April aka Rils - her grandparents gave me a ride to Friendly's with them and got me dinner. Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Yum. A lot of people were there and it was a lot of fun. Thank you so much Rils. It was great.   School tomorrow, Senior Skip Day. Should be nice. Hopefully it will go quickly, although nothing is going to be swift enough until I see Tycho again.   Finally figured out a date for all of that too, good thing lol. Talked about a lot tonight actually.   No clue what is going on tomorrow night, but since Tycho is going to be out I should probably find some way to preoccupy my time. There is always someone I can find to chill with.   Well, I was originally going to keep this short but that never tends to happen so I will end this here. Have a good night/morning/day/evening lol.   -J9
