Taking Back Sunday, ugh! Yesturday I went to my grandma's work at the hospital (I was born there) and we went into the cafeteria and there was a really hot guy there, his name was Anthony, but he was wearing a hair net so that kind added a touch of nerdiness. And  he caught my eyes, and walked over to the register where I was and pretended to be interested in what the 30 year old Korean lady was ringing up for us. He looked like Jake Gyllenhaal, and I love Jake! Ugh!! too bad I'm NEVER gonna see him again. Unless... Warped Tour?
