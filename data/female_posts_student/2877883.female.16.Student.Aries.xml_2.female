I leave you Jason Mraz's fairly hilarious description of Japanese toilets and attacks of Godzilla and Japanese 101 with Professor Mraz:  thursday february 26   Godzilla is Coming!!!  Tokyo’s got it together. Composure. Convenience. Cold fish. Commodes. From vending machines that serve and service anything to heated toilet seats that treat your backside with pride and dignity. Tokyo is the future, 17 hours into the future to be exact.  When I first came to this great city and needed relief from a long flight, I sat and searched for the right words to describe the sensation I wasn’t expecting. I’ve come up with one word so far. Salvation.  First of all, upon entering, the seat is raised automatically for you by the power of god or whatever, but before sitting one needs to prepare the bowl by pressing the aptly named preparation button on the wash-let control panel, the remote unit parallel to the plastic/porcelain pot. This feature heats the seat and stirs up fresh water like a mountain stream in springtime. After one completes his or her task, which needs no explanation or instruction, you are offered two choices as to what you’d like to do next with the robotic bidet, hot or cold. You may control the intensity of the spray to your liking, starting slow to adjust to the shocking temperatures aimed at your heart by way of the lower intestines. Some, more sanitary seats provide a blow-drying option to ease the cleaning before pulling up, but most suggest you use the old-fashioned paper method to absorb the remaining droplets of condensation collected on your can. When leaving the rest area you can count on there being automated soap, water, and hand dryers to ensure you collect no germs on your way out. The only thing missing is an automatic exit door to escape those moments left by the few who pass up the hand-washing portion of the visit to the water closet. I think it should be required to rinse before returning to work. Alarms should sound upon egress, or doors should remain locked until the deed is done. That’s just me.  It was Toca’s birthday the other day. Happy Birthday! He turned 32 again. Go figure. We went out for sushi. He hates sushi. So we humored him and went to an ordinary pub for steaks and cheeseburgers and fries at his request. The place was too small for all 13 of us to sit. We didn’t last long and eventually compromised on a place that served chicken as well as sushi. If there’s one way to Toca’s heart, it’s through his stomach. I feel sorry for any poultry that comes anywhere near Mr. Rivera’s chokehold. Toca certainly knows how to choke his chicken.   I turned on the TV this morning as I was waiting for photos to upload to add to these recent writings. (I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but that’s the new feature to these curbside prophecies, corresponding photographs. A picture can say 1000 words but it can also inspire you to write 1000 more.) So I turned on the moving picture machine to find exactly what I’d expect on Japanese television, a Godzilla looking creature being wrestled to the ground by a suspicious looking Power Ranger character, crashing into miniature buildings and setting them afire with every leap and stumble through their poorly choreographed chaotic dance of catastrophic proportions. I couldn’t understand what the onlookers were saying or why the two were fighting and causing more damage than if just let alone. The creature had drawn on angry eyes and therefore, I assume, deserved to be destroyed. There’s no room in this world, or any fantastical universe for that matter, to carry aggression. Rage against the machine! Rage, rage against the dying of the light! Turn off your televisions! Look out the window! Godzilla is coming!  As intended, we played a great show in Shibuya. This was our second adventure as a live act in Tokyo. I was a bit less intimidated by my little understanding of the language and I let it rip, trusting that whatever wasn’t exactly understood could still be interpreted by my actions and overall mood. I think it went over well. If not, I threw enough guitar picks into the crowd to feed their hunger for substance. I did learn of a few words though, ordinary sayings made simple enough for even me when trying to blend in. I’ll share some with you in case you ever find yourself over here and are looking to make friends of the Japanese variety.  Japanese 101 with Professor Mraz Let’s jump straight into conversation to see how these handy phrases make sense on the street. Pair up and read these aloud with your partner, alternating lines. When you get through, switch turns and practice the reenactment from the other person’s perspective. If you don’t have a partner, make up a silly voice to be the opposing character in the conversation.  Konnichi-wa! Good day! Komban-wa! Good evening! Genki datta? How’s it going? Ammari. Okay, I guess. Doka shita-no? What’s wrong? Shigoto taihen isogashii. I’m really busy with work. Taihen-dane. That’s a bummer. So omou. I think so too. Nihongo hanaso. Let’s talk in Japanese. Demo, eigo sugoku jozu-ne. But your English is so good. Nanka itte. Say something. Nani ni-tsuite hanashiteru-no? What are you talking about? Nyan-nyan. Cat meowing. Mo ikkai itte. Say again? Nani-mo ittenai-yo. I didn’t say anything. Honto-ni? Are you sure? Atama-ga fura-fura. My head feels dizzy. Sugoi. Awesome. Damaso-to shiteru desho! I think you are trying to trick me! Kichigai! You’re crazy! Konna-ni takai-wake nai! This can’t be so expensive! Michi-ni mayotta. I’m lost. Amerika-jin dakara? Is this because I’m an American? Kore wa honto janai desho! This can’t be right! Karaoke suki? Do you like karaoke? Suwatte-mo-ii? May I sit down? Tanoshimo-yo! Let’s party! Yotteru? Are you drunk? Tanoshii-yo. Yeah, I’m having fun. Okutte ku-yo. I’ll take you home. Kirei-na karada-dane. You have a beautiful body. Shitteru. I know it. Anata-ga hoshii. I want you. Daijobu. It’s gonna be okay. Kisu shite-mo ii? May I kiss you? Atashi-wa anata-ni fusawashikunai-wa. I’m not good for you. Gomu tsukeru. I’ll use a condom. Hisashiburi. It’s been a long time. Li kaori. You smell sweet. Mo sugu deru. I’m leaving soon. Zutto issho-ni itai. I wanna stay with you forever. Tai-kara denwa suru. I’ll call you from Thailand.  Aishiteta. I loved you. Sore-wa ato-de hanaso. Let’s talk about it later. Nyan-Nyan! Nyan-Nyan! Cat meowing! Cat meowing! Ki-o-tsukete-ne. Take care. Tokoro-de, Nihon-no kekkon-shikitte ikura-karaku-no? By the way, how much does a Japanese wedding cost?  There, you’re good to go! Of course some of the variations relate specifically to masculine or feminine, but Mraz’s language course is designed to disassemble any barriers and better us into becoming one happy human species rather than remaining complicated with strict gender related rights or lack thereof currently. I can think of a few politicians and a president who could stand to take my class, can you?  Another thing I caught on TV today was the news, and it seems the banning of same-sex marriages is quite the international issue. It seems we have a president who chooses not to change the unconstitutional constitution and grant simple rights to those who may be truly in love, but insists on sealing the constitution for good with an all out ban on the issue. If you’ve never contacted your congressman before, now is an excellent time to exercise one of your last constitutional rights and defend nothing more than love. This isn’t an issue about going against god and ancient mythology, in fact, I believe it’s an act more towards god and good orderly direction, for the people and hopefully, by the people. And while you’ve got the president’s attention, remind him that the constitution that he’s so keen on protecting was printed on hemp paper. If there’s been any act that’s gone against god, it’s been the criminalization of those who happen upon cannibus, the natural byproduct of mother earth loving it’s native inhabitants and vice versa. In the name of war for oil, let’s look into natural alternatives already. I pray the next time I turn on the news I see a miracle and that a brave new president has realized it is the love of the people that equates to power, not money, an army, nor a sophisticated weapons program. If we don’t see this then perhaps something as entertaining, like Godzilla crashing through mansions on Pennsylvania Avenue, not meaning harm to man, just doing what is necessary to scare it’s residents away and reintroduce democracy to the once honorable district. We can learn something from Japan just from their toilet seat ceremonies. Treat every ass**** with respect...  Is this weird? I’m usually not one to paste my opinion on such specifics but this is something I feel strongly about, as a citizen of the United States, and presently as someone who is representing the country abroad. I am proud of my home but feel like we could stand to improve upon a few things, and the only way we will ever reach a happy medium is by creating a dialogue on such topics. Every opinion matters. You matter. Whether you agree with me or not, practice speaking up and inform others of your beliefs. This is a freedom not everyone in this world has, but if we use it wisely and steadily and can make an honest difference then I believe someday we can lend a supportive hand to other countries instead of sending them our stomping foot. Let’s all just move to Japan. That would be easier. Here is peace. Here is polite. Here is perfect. Here is God, even if it is only Godzilla. I’m really happy to be here. …Wish YOU were here.
