First hour we watched Remember the Titans again, second hour we played a game called Mill...Kinda strange...third hour I stained my pot that broke and wrote my name in ink..haha i wasnt to good at that! Fourth hour we watched Max is Missing..Reminds me of the Voyage of the Mimi..a little bit..Fifth hour we watched Annie and Katlyn and I studied science...Um..sixth hour we went outside and we were having a lot of fun cuz emily got up and there were leaves on her ass..It was hilarious!! Then i gave her a rock as a present..We also saw Ryan and we waved..thats the last time i'll see him for 5 days! That really sucks :(..Seventh hour we watched the Anne Frank video..It was really sad, were finishing it tomorrow. And Eighth hour we took a test..I think I got an A it was pretty easy..I just hope tomorrows test is that easy!! Um after school I had to go to studio 906 to get more hair stuff..Then I went to wally world and got a bunch of other stuff. Then I came home and studied for the electronics test in science..and thats about it!!
