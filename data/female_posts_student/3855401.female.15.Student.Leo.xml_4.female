Let me tell  y ou, first i didn't wake up until 3ish-4ish, i don't reall y  remember, then i finished watching Donnie Darko. After that, i went upstairs grazed for a while, and then asked m y  sister to take me to the store. So i went to the store bought some hair d y e, and this is where  y ou find me now, waiting for it to be done. Ah, i have goosebumps, it's ver y  cold in m y  basement. I'm supposed to hang out with Ginnie ma y be when she gets off work, i don't know she said she'd call me. R y an keeps calling me and telling me what he's doing randoml y , but otherwise i haven't really talked to an y one toda y . I need to clean m y  room, it's reall y  mess y . I've noticed that an y one that finds out m y  age is suddenl y  turned off, because i'm onl y  15, it's reall y  funn y  to me. i have 8 minutes until i have to wash this smell y  shit out. do do do do do do do do do do. so cold. Can't wait until the Rise Against show on the 28th, i'm so excited! Ginnie and I were talking and we are thinking about going to the Underoath, The Bled, and Sensesfail on the 26th too. but not sure if its going to happen because we don't have the "bills." My mom asked me again today if i could get her speed. She creeps me out. I think she's hiding things from me. hahahahaha  Sorr y  for boring  y ou, have an excellent night  :)
