I was online until 3 am last night and then the storm woke me up early so that made me even more tired. It is not like I had plans to do anything today anyway. I did want to go swimming, but Leah said no...bummer. I have to admit, I do feel like my day was wasted. But I repeat, I didn't have anything schedule for today anyway. So give me a break. (don't even start singing the Kit-Kat commercial.)      Moving on, obviously nothing important happen today. Well, kinda something did. Our internet was out all day until just about an hour ago. I thought I was going to die. I couldn't check my mail, I couldn't talk to anyone online, I thought I wasn't going to even fill out my blog for the day. What a nightmare! But thankfully, good ol' Joshua pulled through for me. He is awesome with his computer knowledge. Well, compared to me at least. Supposedly we needed to install some SpyBot thingy. Joshua had the disk for us to do so. So by 6:30 this afternoon, my mom and I were on our way over to pick up the disk at Joshua's house. As soon as we returned home my mom began to work on the pc. We first thought it wasn't going to work. But hours later it did! THANK YOU JOSHUA! So yeah, that is all I did today. It was a very short day, and nothing got accomplished. So now here I sit and probably will have another late night just talking to peoples online.      Ok, maybe you are categorizing me as a lazy person now. Sorry, I was just really out of it today. Trust me, I will not make it into a daily thing. Another thing though that has made me happy this evening is the weather is nice and cool. Ahhh, my fall temperatures return. By the way, today will mark the 1yr. anniversary of me having braces. Six more months to go, the countdown begins.Well, nothing more to say, so I am outtie!
