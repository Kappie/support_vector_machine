See it.  Moving on...  Here are the answers to the questions Geoff and Cindel asked me because you all are dying to know.   Cindel  1.   Why is the sky blue?   A clear, cloudless, daytime sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.  I'll even include a picture:     2.   Why do they make glow-in-the-dark underwear?   I had no idea they even MADE glow-in-the-dark undies.  You ask what the reasoning is?  For one, whoever made them must have liked to pee or poo in the dark.  For two, they must have kept losing his/her undies in the dark bathroom.  Obviously, the next step was to invent some glowing underwear.  Obviously.  I mean, why turn on the light?  3.   Why does your butt hurt after you have been sitting down for a long time????   Your butt hurts after you've been sitting for a long time because you squeeze all the blood out of it, therefore making it numb and cold.  Mental image #1266 brought to you by Katie.   Geoffrey  1.   What do you want to do on our 1 year?   On our 1 year anniversary?  I would love to go out to dinner with you because, as you know, I am quite endeared both to you and food.  Olive Garden would be lovely.  But to be quite frank, anything we do will be wonderful.  Just make it really expensive and I'll be happy.  Hahaha.  2.   What is your favorite thing about me?   My favorite thing about you is how loving you are, and not just to me.  Your heart is so big and warm that it encompasses all your friends.  I have seen you grow so much over the years we've known one another and I couldn't be more proud of you.  3.   Why do you love me?   "How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways..."  You know why I love you.  I show you every day.  Silly pants :)  Good night, world...
