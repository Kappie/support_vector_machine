It made me feel so bad. I really just...I dunno what I want anymore. There's almost no point in going back out with him. I mean, the only thing that we would do is sit around telling each other about how much we wanna be with each other. And we practically still do that anyway. We were IMing the other day, and when he had to go, we told each other we loved each other. Which made me...overly happy. Mostly because he isn't holding a grudge, but also because...he still loves me! And I still love him. And, I mean, do we necessarily HAVE to be going out to tell each other we love each other? I mean, it might be a problem if I ever end up going out with a guy here. But that's okay. I don't need anyone else. Because I have someone who holds my heart, and that's all I need. Wow, that was really corny. I don't care. I'm freakin' stressin' because every girl, I swear, at this damn school gives me horrible looks. And I know why: because they're all hoochies, and I DON'T dress like a skank. I'm an outcast because I choose not to conform to their skankish ways. That's okay. If I get my way, I won't be going to this school for long. I'm gonna ask my mom if I can go to the same school as Sherika. Just cuz I get along with people from her school really easy. Trust me, I've met some of them. And at least I won't have to eat lunch by myself there, like I did today. It was pretty damn pathetic. I felt bad for myself. Anyway, I'm really having a bad day. There's so much crap going on that I don't even wanna talk about. But I'm trying really hard not to reach for the razor blade. Really really hard.
