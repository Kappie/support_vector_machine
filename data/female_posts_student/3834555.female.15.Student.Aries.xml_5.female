"Have you ever had a feeling; no defition, no name? just a..feeling?"  its off a John Reuben cd i have. that means alot to me... so much stuff has been going on in my life latley and i hate talking to people now, cuz i whine about my life sooo much and there are other girls out in this world that have it SO much worse than me. so, i go back to wearing a mask everyday, i am now "hppy Karsen" and then i come home and empty all my feelings on a paper and burn it or i just cry it all out. thats what i used to do and every one thought i was so happy and so tight with God.. i mean i AM tight with God now, i have been working super hard on mending our relationship, but i am not happy. well, i have great days were life is good then one day, just one random day.. it all gets turned upsidedown, in a bad way, like i am a TOTAL mess and i feel like my life is a mistake. thats what yesterday was. or last night anywaz, i spent the night at Lindsey's and i just broke down, i just talked and whined and cried. it was HORRIBLE! Lindsey and Carrie were probably like "will you plez just shut up and let us sleep!?!" one thing thats been really bothering me bad is that some of my friends think i lie to them and keep things from them. like for instance, Kasey wrote Lindsey this note on thursday when i was sitting by him, i KNEW it was about me, or parts were so i was like "can i read it?" and he said no, so i just let it be. then he would tease me with it and stuff and grrr, just piss me off. but, since he thinks im blind he wrote the whole note totally in veiw of me, so, naturally, i read it! which, yes, i will tell him i did at church. Kasey thinks i lie to him and that alot i say about my past is a lie and just so i can get attention. he's my BEST FRIEND, why would he lead me on to think he believed me and say these thing and then turn around to Lindsey and be like "oh, i think she does it for attention" really, he is fading so fast, he never calls me, or writes me or even talks to me about ANYTHING barley. everything to him is Lindsey. i guess i just feel let down. i am losing my best friend and i cant do anything, i just have to let him go. tommorow i am going to talk to him and tell him that i read the note and just tell him that if he is done with me then to say so. but, this hurts sooo much, you have no fricken idea, i LOVE him and now, i cant do a thing. he has no idea how i feel about him either, i am thinking about telling him that too, just to get it out and then maybe i can go on. i dont know. i really cant take this, i mean, when i went down to the creek with Lindsey and Carrie and i saw "i love KC" written on the wall and Carrie was like "lindsey was expressing herself through graffiti" i felt like i got punched in the stomache. i tried so hard not to look at the words but i was like a deer in headlights, i couldnt NOT look. i dont blame Lindsey, i dont even blame Kasey, it just hurts so bad because Kasey and i have been so tight for so long and i have liked him for like 2 years and he liked me for a while then after like what? 6 monthes, he falls for someone totally opposite of him, i love Lindsey to pieces, shes my best girl friend, but i just dont understand, i just dont get it. after tommorow i have no idea what is going to happen to Kasey and I's best friendship, i wish i could fix this, but like Lindsey said "maybe i just have to let it lay" and wait... this is going to be the hardest thing i ever have to do, plez, plez pray for me!!
