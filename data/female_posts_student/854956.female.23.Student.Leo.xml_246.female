I haven't seen them in a few weeks... so it was nice to hang out with them a bit.  And the class was about games and manipulatives... so we got to play with stuff for 2 hours.  :-)  Tomorrow I'm facilitating a class from 3:15-5:15... then I'm coming home to pack up some stuff and go to Austin till Sunday evening.  Should be loads of fun!  :-)  Jennifer's going up, and to my understanding Druck will be up there too... Which means, this is the first time since Christmas that our whole group has hung out together.  Weird.  Anyhow... I think I'm going to do a bit of laundry tonight... so I have clothes in Austin... and tomorrow before I go into work, I really should try to swing by the library and get my book renewed... maybe two.  I only read 2 of the books (Elvis book and Louis Armstrong book)... and I'm about half done with Little Women.  But I still wanna read Interview with the Vampire.  So I think I'll renew LW and IwtV.  *sigh*  I realized in the past couple weeks how much I miss reading.  I haven't done a whole lot because I always have stuff to read for school.  And it's hard for me to read things I need to read if I'm reading things I want to read.  I don't put the wanted aside for the needed.  :-(  Oh well... anyhow... that's all for now... I'll possibly post again while in Austin... else my next post will be when I get back.  :-)  Have a nice weekend and such!  :-)
