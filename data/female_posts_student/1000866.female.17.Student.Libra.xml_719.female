I was having a great summer because I wasn't letting myself think at all. I was just doing stuff all the time. I'm trying to remain optimistic, but stuff sucks on so many different levels right now. Sometimes it's hard to see the glass half full. Heh. It's funny. Brett told me the other night to see the glass as 1/2 of it's capacity. That way, neither phrase really works. I wonder who even came up with that.   Anyway, lots to do this afternoon. Then, I think I'm hanging out with Matthew and Chris tonight...maybe. I stayed up really late talking to Chris about the general suckyness of stuff right now. Most depressing conversation I've had in a while, but I needed it. I need to talk to Brandon too. I really miss him. I kind of just want to bypass senior year and go on to college and get away from this town and just start things over.   Gee, if I feel like this when I'm not PMS'ing, what will next week be like?
