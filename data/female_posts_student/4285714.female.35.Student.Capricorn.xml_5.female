It's really nice to have someone who understands and wants to strangle my hubby besides me. I am definitely going to check out the website that was suggested.  As for right out asking him if he's cheating....I know that won't work because I have no doubt that if asked he will say" no" whether he is cheating or not.  I'd like to think that he is not cheating but all the signs say that he is. Most of my suspicions are based on me being sneaky. I checked his cellphone while he was asleep and there was incoming and outgoing calls to the same number, many of them,  so being the nosy soul that I am, I called the number and got a voice mail for someone named Sabrina. That's the moment I decided that he was definitely cheating. He is supervisor of a large corporation and I know he talks to many people on that phone for business but this number stood out because there were so many of them. Now for the last week he's been coming home late every evening, he says there's a "boiler" down at work but if I try to contact him at work I can't get him, that coupled with the fact that he's not speaking to me confirms it in my mind.  Geez loueeeze......I didn't start this blog as a means to whine and I don't want it to turn into that. I'm actually a strong person and I can make it on my own but it's not the making it on my own that's breaking my heart, it's the losing my husband. We have no common children, my daughters are 12 and 18 (yep! I started young ) , he is 8 years older than me and I was sure hoping that would mean that he would be more mature than the guys my age.............guess not! But he is very close to my kids and I don't want to shake up their world either with a divorce. He has kids of his own from a prior marriage, 23, 21 and 19 and we all get along wonderfully.  When we started dating, I was a full-time student working towards my AS in nursing. After we married I quit school to work (( I am a CDA (Certified Dental Assistant)  so that we could save up money to buy a house of our own, which we did 4 years ago. I haven't worked for the 2 years since I had all my surgeries and now I am ready to go back and finish my degree, I have half of the credits required to finish but alas now we  "don't have the money"  which I think is a load of BS, we have the money for everything else. So now I am thinking" I put my educatin on hold to get a home that will either go to him or be sold in the divorce (there's that overactive-imagination thing again) and I'm going to have to figure out how to raise my daughters on$13.00 an hour" which isn't gonna happen.  Soooo.............my plans are to go to the college on Monday and sign up for at least 2 classes and get a short term loan and then come the first of the month use his credit card to pay off the balance so I can get on with my life.  I'm not a sit back and sulk  kinda girl, I'm an "okay, if this is how you want it then let's rumble" kinda girl. I'm still young (35) and attractive and have many years ahead of me to continue down this path we call life. I won't sit around and be put upon, if he's moving on then so am I.  So anyway.......Thanks for listening :o) and thanks again for the input. I agree with the passive agressive mentality of what he's doing and it sucks! Grow up already! I also agree that "men suck". I'm off to check out that website.  On a lighter note...my favorite time of year is here again. My daughter is a varsity cheerleader for her high shcool (as well as a senior this year) and next friday is our first footabll game. Go gators!!  I'm still trying to figure out how in the hell to put a list of other blogs on the left side of the screen, I've emailed blogger for help but no answer yet!!  Ta for now and live life to it's fullest!!!    Dawn
