Like the time that me and Izzy were hiding from every one in camp and we managed to kick a load of wood ants and shout to the other team that "There's no one here!" Haha, that was funny. Yeah, I'm crap at telling stuff! Mmm... well old stories that happened, heck, any stories! So Blob is feeling better! (Was she called Blob? I forgot) Well I think she is, which is good! Yeay! Oh and Lynne's mad... oh and it's raining loads! It's really sad, I was watching spooks and apart from some one dieing horrible, this racist barstard (sorry guys!) was on it and I was like "Ooooh, I'm gonna kill him" I hate prejudice, it's all about feeling that you're better than some one for some reason or other and it really pisses me off! So does some one threatening me with violence. Funny, some one shouts at me and I ignore them, then they threaten to punch me and all of a sudden I start screaming at them and go off in a huff! (Geez, you're weird!) Hey, I better go, Rik's doing his GCSE's and he wants a go so bubi!
