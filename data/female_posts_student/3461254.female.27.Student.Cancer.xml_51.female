Gone will be the days of sitting around on MY couch, watching MY TV, in MY perfect world of solitude. Of course, I will be looking forward to the days of living rent-free and relatively bill-free. So, I guess it slightly balances out. I'll be able to afford full-time grad school and gas in the tank! I'll miss St. Clair Shores, but mostly just the water. Now my priority is finding a reasonable self-storage facility to share with Kate. Her new apartment's balcony isn't big enough for her patio set.
