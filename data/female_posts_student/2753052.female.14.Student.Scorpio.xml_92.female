I don't need to prove anything I trust him and he respects me =)      I'm so tired and people are slamming doors in this house and fighting bleh. This girl who i used to be best friends with in february but then we didn't talk for a while and now we're friends again, her boyfriend broke up with her and she's really upset. So this morning i talked to her and i was on my way to the beach so i said i'd talk to her tonight and i promised to be online and everything and i said maybe i'd call her if my aunt wasn't hoging phone and all this other stuff. So I was so fucking tired tonight and i wanted to go to bed so badly but i left aim on and forced myself to stay awake just so i could talk to her and i waited for her to get back from work and everything like i said i would just so we could talk so it gets to be like 10 and then she comes online and puts an away message on "I don't want to talk to anyone." People so selfish sometimes. I was falling asleep on my bed waiting for her and I was so tired and all i wanted to do was sleep but i somehow stayed awake and then she goes and does that. It's so stupid. I'm always giving my whole life to other people and then i don't get same back. I would die for anyone that i care about and i just feel alot of the time they wouldn't do same for me. oh well. the end.       Today was really fun but tiring we made a huge hole in the sand and buried merri's little brother joey in it and then shaped him like a mermaid. He is becoming a huge pervert when we were making his boobs up he was like "BUILD THEM UP TO HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!" lmao. I got annoying white jellyfish and sand all over my ass and legs it was great. We made joey's boobs so big that little kids were coming over to see what we were doing and their parents were turning them away. Joey was all over me and erin too hugging us and kissing our hands lmao. Then in the car joey decided to tell me who he liked and he whispered in my ear that he liked this girl emily and i said a little too loudly "Emily what? Corbet?" or something like that and merri and his mom heard so he got really pissed at me cuz he immature 10 yr old of course and he wouldn't talk to me and told me i wasn't his friend anymore lol. Then he started pinching me 20 times, he gave me "sunburn" on my arm which is like when you twist the person's skin it's so painful and i was screaming it hurt so bad, he threw this ball at my back, he said tonsss of things that i won't repeat, and he was being an obnoxious brat -_-. I said I was sorry like 5000000 times and felt really bad but he just kept doing more mean stuff. So then he told me that the only way i could make it up to him was to give a strip show on a soccer field in front of everyone and HE had to be there or date his friend eric who broke a window. I said i wasn't doing either. Then he said that to make it up to him i could scream at the men outside that i thought they were sexy so i did that and i screamed "I THINK YOU'RE SEXY" at tons of guys from the car when we passed them. Then he decided that i skipped some men so he still wouldn't forgive me -_-. Later on his mom told me that joey probably made up that name and that she wasn't even a real girl and he was just doing all that stuff to make me feel really bad. Joey said she was a real girl and I hurt his feelings and all this other stuff ugggg. I bet she really is a pretend girl and he did all that stuff to me for no reason lol. So now he's mad at me but he'll probably forget all about it in a few days cuz he's a weird kid. I'm 17 and shouldn't care about a dumb 10 yr old but I just feel bad because i don't like to make people mad or feel bad or anything even if it is a 10 yr old. whatever.       K now i'm talking to that girl and trying to help her and i feel like a moron cuz i can't.      baiii people this was a long post    P.S. I wrote this last night and put it in the blog but the blog fucked it up so i had to copy it and put it in now...
