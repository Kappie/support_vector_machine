Angklung is too lovable, and Malay Society is compulsory so I'm goonna quit Tribune. Dad says that if I still don't change my attitude then, he'll pull me out of the school because he says taht I'm not living up to the reputable name of the Raffles family. Ah, the pros and cons of having a father from ri. I got in because of him but I can also go out because of him. That doesn't make any sense at all. And he expects me to be sensible. Sheesh. Look, i may appear quite carefree on this matter but it bothers me a lot. Duh. It's a matter of my expuulsion from my dream school or not. It's not even fair...it's not rg's fault. It's just me. It's not fair to me or to the school or to even him. And btw, he hasn't found out I lie to my teachers. I seem to not care that I handed in my Geog and Maths and Malay assignments late and that O'm getting just-pass grades for every single subject on earth. It's because I do the same at home. They scold me, I'm irritated becuase I don't have a chance to speak up on what I believe in, and then that maakes us both angry like hell. I just switch off whenever I get scolded. He's thrown stuff at me before and he's punched me bafore. What the hell of a difference does it make? Sheesh. My frineds all think that i just can't be bothered. Even my mum thinks that way. I tell you, my parents just aren't normal. I think i have to go now, sorry for such a short entry which wastes my time and your time. I shall call you Fran, short for Francsesca. I like that name. Ok, REALLY gtg. Signs off.   Bye and thanks for being the only one who understands me Fran aside from Maria my fave cousin in the whole wide world. I luv my blog. And Fran. And Maria. Wow, ending so long. BYE!!!
