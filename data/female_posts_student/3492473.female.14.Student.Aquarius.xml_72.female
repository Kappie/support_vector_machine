I guess that whole "actions speak louder than words" saying is true. I never really believed it before but now I do. And the people who say the things to my face are people who I thought I could count on. Good friends. But with every passing day, I've realizing how much people lie. And how much people use me for advice, phone numbers, and everything else. It's just disgusting. And I'm getting so sick of being nice to the people who treat me like crap. Another thing that pisses me off: how one person can trash another person so bad and the next day they're hanging out and being best friends again, the one person acting like they never trashed the other. It's like what the fuck? I'm so sick of all these people. It's getting to the point where I can only stand a few of them. Screw it, I really don't care about being popular or having everyone like me anymore, if my so-called "friends" are gonna treat me like shit, then fuck them! Honestly. I mean I've tried to see if it's just a faze they're going through but too many people care about being popular, impressing the guys, and being little whores, that they don't include me in any outings. I'm sorry but I can only tolerate so much bull shit. So keep up with your games and you could lose a friend. Seriously. I'm not into games. I think you know who you are. Sooner or later, guys are gonna start realizing personalities are more important than how much skin you show so yeah... fuck this all...
