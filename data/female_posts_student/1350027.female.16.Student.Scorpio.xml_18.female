So, every night I go to sleep praying that when I wake up the next day, I'll be 10 inches taller.  My prayers are still in pending. Because he is God, and he is the Almighty - I'm giving him a week to answer my prayers and perform the miracle of legs lenghtening. If he doesn't reply, I'm going to lose all faith and the next time I sign up for anything I'm going to place DISABILITY and consider myself a midget.  After all, that is sort of a handicap, right? I mean, dwarfs aren't exactly normal, yeah? I'd probably get some advantages anyways.   I mean, I swear I have everything.  I don't have small feet.  I can easily fit into a size 25 (The maximum size is 26).  I could pose (Okay, maybe not that naturally - but nothing abit of chemical substance can't help).  I could so do the catwalk.  I could be posh (with the help of a few etiquette lessons).  And I can so be PERSONALITY.   ONLY THING STOPPING ME:   MY FUCKING LEGS.   Okay. And my ass la. I mean, my ass could get smaller la, and perhaps tighter abs..and a new nose and an eyelift.   It just isn't fair. Not fair, not fair, not fair. You aren't suppose to go scrolling around on the beach being perfect. There has to be this distinct flaw. Perfection is something which can never be grasp. Bleh. But that statement has been proven wrong. So wrong.    I bet they have smell armpits or something. I hope they do anyways. And a big boil behind their necks or something. GRR.   I'm just sad I have no hope whatsoever of being a model and modelling for chanel or something. *sniff*    PS: I think I've been watching too much telly and reading too many magazines. Brainwashing.
