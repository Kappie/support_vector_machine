We have a foreign exchange student from Germany, her name's Marija (the j is silent). She seems really nice. We have 2 classes together, English and History. Today, at least, we sat together at lunch.  I will try to get Carlsbad pics up here soon, probably Saturday at the earliest. It takes forever to load, so I need to wait until I have time. Erika, if you really want to see some pics, I could email them to you. That might actually be easier. But, I will try to put them here for everyone to see.  Well, I have to leave for youth group in about 5 minutes, so I g2g. TTYL!!  ♥♥♥
