I chose "The grass is greener on the other side" as the name of my blog, and... here we go again:  Where should I live? This is obviously not the place... But now that I've moved so many times, I need to start to wonder if there's not something wrong with me, instead of the places where I live... But, then again, I've maybe just been unlucky, picking the wrong destinations? And what if I made a list (oh yes! a list! that sounds like a good idea... It's not like I haven't tried making lists before!!!)? I could  write on this list ALL the things that are important to me (meaning, the kind of things I think I cannot live without), and then I only have to find the place in the world that fits best with that list. And then, I just have to make it work. But what if it doesn't work? What if I'm not satisfied with my life there? There are no more excuses then!  can't go around saying "yes, but that's because this is not the right place for me". Because it would be the most fitted place (according to my list). But then I'd have to wonder about my list... Perhaps I've judged the wrong things to be of importance? But wait! I'm being pretty negative, here! What if it DOES work out? What if this is the way to find my little piece of paradise, the place where I belong, where I just feel home the minute I get there? But shouldn't I be smarter by now? I've sort of believed that many times before... I get a place on my mind, think it's paradise on earth, move there... and then get really disappointed and can't think of anything else than to get out of there. I should really start to learn from my mistakes (sometimes I think I do, though...).  But maybe it's just because I used the wrong criteria to pick these places?? Hmmmm..... Yes! I'm definitely gonna make that list! Can't harm!........... Or can it? I'll take the risk to get totally focused on a place again, and not do all the things I'm supposed to do  because I'd be spending my whole time looking things up on the net about what it's like to live in..... Quebec, for example! Yeah... I guess I have a pretty good idea that that's the kind of places my list would bring me to.... And what if it doesn't?? The question is: can I make that list so objectively that I actually won't be picturing a place already while making it?....  OK. I'm making the list.
