It’s hateful, that’s true, I hate you, yes I do. All you want to do is make my life miserable, But I’d give it all for the rain and drizzle. You tear me within, Killing my grin, Killing my love within. It’s all thanks to you I can’t go through My life without a caring friend. They are more than you do, I’m sure it’s true. My friends love me; Their love is stronger than the sea. Unlike you, they care; Are as protective as a bear. Love me as strong as rocks, Guard me like cops. They’ve always been there, When no one else cared. So here’s to you, my dad: Leave me alone, my friends care, They won’t hurt me, they won’t tear, My heart to pieces. They wont break my should with hate, But mend it with fate. They won’t cuss at me for explaining, But stand with me, even if it’s raining. They’re always there, Because they forever care.  this one was when i was especially mad at my dad
