Of course, once all the surplus tonnage disappears, so will everything else, but I actually don't mind.  I don't have any discernible waist or hips, so I'm a little boy-shaped.  On the handy Land's End swimsuit guide, my body shape is designated as the rectangle shape, but I guess that's better than being the really hippy triangle shape.  Once I lose all the extra pounds, I'll hopefully be a size 2 or 4, but that all depends on my exercise plans.  I'm doing my  urlLink Weight Watchers  online weigh-in tomorrow morning, so I'll be at Bally's to use the accurate medical scale once I wake up, right after I pee, before I drink anything, before I shower and before I have any heavy thoughts.  I've already lost one pound, so I'm feeling fairly successful.  I've been sticking to this diet religiously for the last two weeks, and I'm not cheating.  I had a double cheeseburger for dinner last night at McDonald's, and even though it was 12 Points, I still recorded it.  Thank G-D for Flex Points!!!  For lunch today it's Lean Cuisine Baked Fish with Cheddar Shells.  Yum!!  Seriously--it's yum!
