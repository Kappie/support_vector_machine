The thing is I do not just make promises, I really mean them when I make them. And I am not talking about big promises here, life altering decisions I am quick to make and I almost always keep such big promises. But when it comes to the little things (or are they not as little as I think they are??) a change of my mood turns me into a different person and I end up wanting to do things differently. Tonight I think of going running in the morning but then in the morning I wake up wanting to do something completely different. So it's kind of like I cannot keep the promises I make to myself. For this reason alone, I do not want to make plans. I do not know how I will be feeling at a certain time in the future even if that future is half an hour later. I am a wonderful dreamer and a lousy planner. I am tired of this roller coaster of my emotions.  And there are the things that I will keep wanting for all eternity no matter what mood I am in. The problem with those are that I am always in the process of getting there and never feel completely accomplished. Maybe it's because I can never really define what it is that I really want. What I want is an ever changing ever evolving thing, so much that I am always one day short of accomplishing it.
