I know i still kinda feel like i'm robbing the cradle because he only about to turn 15, but thats ok, he's got the most beautiful raven black hair i've ever seen.  And his eyes are bautiful, i hope they're not contacts.  Everyone knows as well as i do that i usually go for blondes, but this kid is one of the few exceptions.  Sorry Kubic that we didn't get to go see it together, but i'll gladly go see it with you again!  Alright so Saturday, i had this family dinner but Ash, Gary, Julie and Kubic all saved me by asking me to come over with them to Gary's house and watching a movie.  It was fun, even though we didn't actually watch a movie.  After finishing the movie at Gary's house, we went over to Ash's house and played volleyball.  Me, Kubic and Gary attempted at soccer, but it didn't work out because a) i'm used to playing a goalie in hockey (lol Nadia and Kendra, my fellow 2004 Varsity PE hockey champions!) and b)we didn't exactly have an official goal and we didn't know where we were supposed to kick the ball.  Plus, Kubic is alot bigger than i am, so he probably could've taken me if he hadn't been scared that he was going to lose to me lol.  We got eaten alive by mosquitoes and then we went home.  Kubic said he might take of work Thursday so we can finally hang out because we never get to.  Then me, Ash, Gary and Julie went up to Steak and Shake to visit Lindsay.  Of course, i called my dad at 10:05 and he's like "you have to be home at 10:30", so i made Gary eat really super fast so i could get home in time after taking him home.  Then when i get home, it turns out that my parents didn't care!  What!?!?  Oh well.  Oh yes, i have decided, that in my extreme boredom, i am going to try to read all FIVE Harry Potter books in a week.  I started this on Saturday so i have until this Saturday to finish.  I already finished the first book on Saturday and i started the second book today.  Anybody want to make any bets on if i can do it?   Today, i didn't do much of anything.  I haven't slept in 2 days and i don't know why.  Sarah thinks it might be because i've got things on my mind or i'm stressed about something.....but if i've got things on my mind, why don't i know what they are!?!  I guess i should think about stuff.....one of today's events will have me thinking i'm sure.    hmm, i think i'm going to go back to reading!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
