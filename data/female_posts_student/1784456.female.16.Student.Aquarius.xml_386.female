In 1910 is they sent 10 women out on the streets with cigarettes campaigning for Women's liberty, and soon, all the women in America start smoking! And they changed the world from a world where people own things and keep those same things for the rest of their lives, to a world where everyone wants new things all the time. Crazy huh? if they hadn't done that then we'd all probably be living the way they lived back in the 1940s, and there would be no such thing as mass production, pollution or global warming. wieeeeeeerd!! And the guy behind it all was Sigmund Freud's nephew, (you know, the famous phsycology guy) who got his ideas from reading his uncle's book! But the scary thing is, he didn't do it to try and make the world a better place, he did it purely for money and power. He manipulated the subconcious minds of thousands of people, like in batman or something! with the evil "Ahahaha i will take over the world" kind of baddie, but it actually worked, and people have only just realised it! Ok, i'll shuttup now! that was my deep phsycological rant of the day, bye bye!
