I thought movie was rather poor in quality while Theo loved it.   Yesterday I watched Amelie. It was a very nice change from all the blood-and-guts war films I've been watching.  It was in French(with subtitles), a welcome change. Audrey Tautou starred and, wow, what a cutie! I was entranced by her beauty, only magnified by the fact she was speaking those cute little French words from her pretty little mouth. Oui Oui indeed!  The film itself was incredibly clever and laugh out loud funny at many points. Have ya'll ever seen the online travel site commercials on television with the little Yard Gnome in all the pictures? Well, I do believe that those commercials are a homage to this film and one of its many humorous subplots. This was a true "feel-good" romantic comedy, and, being a devout fan of such films, this was a true treat. It had biting realism mixed up right along with fairy-tale innocence.  I don't feel the need to tell you the plot, since you can easily find out that information elsewhere online should you so choose.  Take a look at Miss Tautou:    She's a real darling isn't she? I'm not trying to objectify women here, but she's simply entrancing. Talk about eyes you could drown in!  While I'm typing, allow me to voice a complaint as a Southerner. I am currently reading a book called "Ice Tea and Elvis: A Saunter Through the Southern States" by Nick Middleton. The author, an Englishman, barely steps off the plane before he starts criticizing the South on problems both real and imagined. You'll find no positive thoughts in this book, but I digress. My problem is with the title. First of all, it 'taint "Ice Tea", it's "Iced Tea"! In any case, few folks order "Iced Tea" in the South. We order "Sweet Tea" or "Unsweet Tea". It's all black, and it's all iced!  Secondly, I wasn't privy to the knowledge that Elvis was a Southern icon. He was from here, sure, but wasn't he more of an American icon with his Rock-N-Roll and Hip-Swinging? If you want a  real Southern icon, look at Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Hank Williams, etc.
