I would definitely recommend going to a Blue Mesa for happy hour as they have free quesadillas and chips.  Very tasty.  Their beer is 2.00, but their mixed drinks are 5.95 and I had 3.  Not too excited when I had to pay 20.00 in drinks.    So here's the real story about my night.  Christina and I were walking up to the door to Blue Mesa and I see this guy standing out there talking on the phone.  Now from afar and not having my contacts in, I think he looks pretty cute.  He's dressed cute anyway.  Anyway we get closer and I think he see's us looking at him so I look away and never get a good look at him.  Well he comes into Blue Mesa too.  Christina and I get our table and wait on Ben.  I notice that guy keeps looking at me so I smile back at him a few times.  What am I supposed to do?  Well I go in line and get quesadillas for us and he comes up behind me to also order some.  I make small talk and without really thinking about it say, "Are you hanging out here alone"? He says, "No, I'm waiting on some friends to get here".  That's the end of the conversation because my food was ready.  So I go sit back down.  I guess it sounded like a pick up line, but really I was just trying to be nice.  He kept looking at me and I felt sorry he was standing there alone so I was going to invite him to sit with us.  Plus, upon closer attention to him, I realized he didn't really have a chin and his teeth were bad.  I really need to wear my contacts.  Damn beer goggles and I wasn't even drunk yet!
