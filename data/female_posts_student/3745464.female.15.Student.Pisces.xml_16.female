Its always better and safer to say Morning...they can get to say if its good or not...so many of u are wondering what the HELL am i doing up @ 5:30am let me tell you its been anything but a "good morning" One of my friends is moving today. so did i sleep at all last night no...gawd this really sucks im not good with byes i always cry and i dont want him too see me cry...Marty(aka dad) has asked me to come up and get coffe with him i think at this stage no dad would know what to say to his teenage daughter about one of her friends(a guy) moving. At least hes trying but he said somthing this morning he said "if u want salisa would take you over there" nice offer huh? yea cause i really want the ONE person i REALLY hate to take me to say good-bye to someone i really love ya thats sounds like a plan...does he think im stupid no matter what she does im never gonna like her....its just NOT gonna happen. so i think for a while im gonna be in a pretty shitty mood who knows. Its not like me and him wont see each other again things will just be different VERY different. i jus notice im not sure if my clock thing is right maybe it is *memo to slef check clock thing* Good-bye Funny word huh? just like good morning whats sooo good about saying good-bye...why do we have to put good in front of every fuckin thing we say.Bye sounds much better theres nothing good about saying good bye to a friend to a loved one or to someone who dies...i guess people could say good-bye because they may never see that person again but is that a good thing...maybe some people think it is...so i feel pretty pathic just sittin here complaing about our english system but u have to understand im doing everything i can for just two mins not to think about him...guess it really didnt work...i think im going to finish my coffe and watch whatevers on TV then wait for 10:00 to come for now bye
