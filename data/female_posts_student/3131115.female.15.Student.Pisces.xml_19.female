My mood sucks, but it's unusual. I feel alone right now..I AM alone, in my house....but that's not what I mean. Nothing seems to be going right. I mean, everything is right in my LIFE, other than a few very unimportant things...but I'm still feeling like everything is fucked up. I've been having quite a good time spending my weekends with Ashley. I guess that it kind of makes me feel good inside thinking about that. Although....at the same time it makes me feel alone, again. She isn't here now..and it seems that weekends dont last long. I dont get to see her often. Neither do I get to see Bill a lot. I love spending time with Bill. I really wish that him and I could be alone though. His mom was talking to me about how she can't leave us alone and shit, it makes me uncomfortable, but oh well. It doesnt matter. I want to go to sleep, but for some reason I feel like I should be doing something right now. I need to find something else on the internet that will keep me busy and inerest me. I want to find more people lke me on the internet to talk to. :-/ Maybe I should try... I will write later.    It's always raining in my head
