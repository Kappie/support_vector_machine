You are Gambit!  You are a fierce fighter and a good friend to have.  Your preference for solitude and your attractiveness make you very intriguing to those you meet. Unfortunately, close relationships are few and far between for you because you often have trouble opening up to others.   urlLink  Which X-Men character are you most like?       Hmm...suppose I should see about getting familar with this character, of whom I've never heard.
