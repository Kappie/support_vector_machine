But it's so close to being school time again, that going is really gonna be shitful.  I mean I want to go, but I also want to just stay home and not do anything until school starts.  Oh yeah, school blows.  Anyway, I'm going to miss you all.  WHAT THE FUCK????  I did not just say that.  I won't miss you at all, except for like 2 people.  Goodbye, assbags.  Ha ha, Ashley I stole your word.  BITCH.
