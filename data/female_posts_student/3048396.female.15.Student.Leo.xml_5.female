I think only Tracy and Ashley know what Im talkin bout so yeah. I don't want the whole freakin world to know bout stuff I wanna keep to myself. But yeah that stuff is all confusing me and yeah. Oh well...As long as I go with their ideas or w/e nothing will happen and all shall be good. Hmm...Some people are still mad or w/e at me...but I dont care anymore. Umm..yeah. So in choir we have this song called "Mama Look Sharp" Its kinda...odd..but theres this one part in it that says somethin like "I'll close your eyes my Billy...those eyes that cannot see" keeps goin on n stuff and Tracy and I changed it into many different "bad" forms. LoL Great song now. LoL and Derricks nickname is Billy so that made us laugh even harder...lol..yup...Hmm I really dont have much to ramble about cuz im a loser and have no life...so yeah....I have YC this weekeng..last meeting of this year...*sigh* so I guess Im lookin forward to that...I probably wont write again till I get home...unless something interesting happens...which it wont...since my life is very uneventful. So yeah...later.  -Tara
