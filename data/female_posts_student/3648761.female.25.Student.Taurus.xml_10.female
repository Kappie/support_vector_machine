I also found out that my sister is going to buy the house next door to my moms house. Which at least I don't have to travel far to  visit my family.  Had lunch and dinner over there. LOVE, Love Love my mom's cooking. What is it about mom's cooking that is so great. I can make the same receips at home but they never taste the same.  Well today is another busy day.  I have to go to my mom's run some errands, and then be back and ready by five to go to the first annual  urlLink lucky's Fest .  Well hope everyone has a great weekend
