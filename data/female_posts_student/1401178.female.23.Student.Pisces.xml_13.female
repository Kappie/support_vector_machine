I will put a links page soon, more organized of course. Also a featured links every posts, which will be archived on the links page.  Finally, I'm getting used to this. Hurraaah!!!  PS : Damn cable!!! Instead fixing the problem with Star TV, they change the channel. Not that I don't mind having Now!, FashionTV, and Soundtrack Channel...but I need Star World, you eedjits!!! I already missed Oprah for 3 weeks!!! Aaaaaaaargh!!!
