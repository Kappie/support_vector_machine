About how if we'd been neighbors she and Natalie would have been best friends and she and I would be enemies.  Thinking on this it would serve to think I would also be a happy, preppy cheerleader by now; i'd have also died my hair blonde instead of dark brown (which isn't far from my original shade, anyway.)  As this thought crossed my mind you can imagine that I, Jennie Harris, poet, anti-labels and people who fit them, Christian, was quite, quite disgusted with myself. Than again, my daddy would have never hit me to hard as a child and in fact, my mommy and daddy would still love each other. My daddy would own his own buisness dealing with Oil exports and mommy would be a happy homemaker.  Natalie would have directed her amazing talent of story telling (which she does have) onto paper. We'd all go to church on Sundays and Wednesdays and if possible everyday in between and be a happy, loving, Godly family.   Oh, and I'd be super skinny.      Where did my parents go wrong?       Why is life so unfair?
