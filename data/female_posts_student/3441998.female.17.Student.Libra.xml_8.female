During July my friend T-bear came back in town for about a week and he just got done recording a CD with his band. The group is called Entering Canaan and most of the songs on the cd was written by them. I am so happy for them and I wish them the best luck. So beside that I just got the books I have to read. The Pearl has to be on the top 10 worst book in the World list. Ever time I tried to read it I fall asleep or just put it down. School will be starting Aug. 26 I think. It always started in the middle of the week. At least I got a lil more time off than Zac. I wonder what everyone is up to now?? Well I guess I'll get off and find out . C ya later
