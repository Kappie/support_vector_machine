Then we'll be off to down town for some shopping and then to the beach for a little fun in the sun. After that we are going to some party. *Smiles probably going to meet up with some Notre Dame girls. SHOP SHOP SHOP I think I'll get me some tna capris.  Checked my e-mail today of the 92 I had 90 unread. I really shoudl check it more often. *Sigh check my other accounts? Meh, maybe later. Woah there was some weird e-mails though. Trevor seemed mad that I never e-mailed him back. I should call him.
