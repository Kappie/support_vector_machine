I told her I am still somewhat depressed coz I haven't found a full-time job yet. I don't know what is up with everyone. Ching is it true that you'll lose your job at Spiegel? Jeng actually gave me a call today and she also said that her company will be relocating next month. She too will have to find a new job by the end of April. Oh well, hang in there and good luck with your job hunting. Cel, Congratulations! You're family and I are very thrilled to hear that you'll be graduating soon. I hope you got graduation money already. :)
