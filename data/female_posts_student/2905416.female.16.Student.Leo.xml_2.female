I still have 'Chronic Boredom', as I told you in my last post, and have decided to post again in a vain attempt to relieve this. So far it hasn't worked, but I spose I should give it a bit more of a chance.   The little library venture I mentioned in my last post was unsucessful, as they had neither of the books I wanted, but I did get them on a more recent visit. Oh, how lame my existance is, reduced to talking about visits to the library. *sigh* Ah, well, I spose it should pick up. I am going on holiday in a week, for a week, on a houseboat. Bring on the continual rocking, I say, and the sunburn, partial sea sickness, etc etc. It should be good.   Shool. Ah, yes, where do I start. *yawn* 'Tis really quite boring. I tried to liven it up a bit, and stole some matches form the science labs. Funnily enough, I got caught, and nearly scored myself a detention, but wormed my way out of it by crying, appologising, and generally groveling on my hands and knees. Arg, how sad my life is.   I recently took a test to see how much of a freak I am. Apparently I am 37% pure freak. I was quite impressed, considering most of the questions went along the lines of 'Do you run around town wearing a cape?' I answered no to this, but I wouldn't mind trying it. Perhaps I'll visit the supermarket while I'm wearing the cape, and ask if they sell tinned blood.   I still haven't got very far with my taking-over-the-world palns, either. Only one of my friends seems to want to help, and that'll be in the hacking department, so I still need henchmen/minions. Perhaps I'll recuit over the internet, it's full of weird people. (err...no offence or anything)   Ah well, I shall update again soonish. Until then, 'Bon Appetite!'   Crisp *hand movement*
