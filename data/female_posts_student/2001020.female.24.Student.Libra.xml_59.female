I just want things to be better overall. I want M to say that he loves me, I want him to kiss me more, I want to feel special and important like E claims that I am. Frustrating. I do love him, but do I? I had a long talk with a friend last night at our law firm party...made me think a lot about things...a lot. He says I can't be in love, not yet. But I could, but not the kind of love that makes you head over heels crazy and not the kind of love where even when you're pissed and his true colors come through, you'd still be there. That was only R, and no one is R, and R is gone, and I can't go looking for that in everyone. So. I called R last night, in my drunken frenzy. I have to be less stupid when I'm drinking. I promised myself no talking to him until I was over him, and then I make an ass of myself in a drunken haze? No, no excuse. I asked him stupid questions which he had no answer to...he can't tell me why he isn't in love with me anymore. He can't say anymore than he already has...so what the hell am I looking for? I like my relationship with M, I do, but it's never going to become what I need. At least at this point I don't think so. I like spending time with him, I like knowing him, I like what he brings to my life. But he and I both know that we aren't going to end up together one day (that magical mystical "one day"). So maybe there isn't a point...I dunno. I'm rambling today. I feel like rambling. Honestly, I should just take a nap now. I think I will. And listen to Coldplay. Or download some Chris Cornell. It's a good remedy for a broken heart.
