Maybe I did okay on my psych exam, but even if I didn't, I get to drop an exam.  Yeah, and don't even bother asking about Biology.  I'll find out tomorrow how I did, but I'm thinking it wasn't good.  Let's see.... I'll be done with my psych labs on Monday, which will be nice because I won't have to worry about making up any labs next semester.  That'll be nice.  :-)  Tuesday I got my World Civ. test back, and I got a B.  This was especially surprising, because I really thought I had gotten a C or lower.  But a B is fine with me!  Yesterday I was sick... again.  I woke up with a migraine... then later on that night I got an upset stomach.  I'M convinced that it was because I tried Excedrin Migraine for the first time.  My Mom thinks that I would've had a reaction much sooner.  But, I dunno... sometimes it just depends.  Anyhow, it was not fun, of course PUKING never is.  Today was a pretty good day... went to class... all I had to do was watch  urlLink Amadeus , which is a movie that I really like a lot.  I began watching the movie at the age of 6.  Yes, I'm a weird one... but everyone has always known that.  Oh!  Last Thursday I got my  urlLink Return to Oz  DVD in the mail!  YAY!  I was so so happy.... I LOVE that movie.  And in all actually the only other person I know that watched the movie as a child is Ricky.  Which I suppose explains a lot about both of us... hehe  Um, tomorrow night (after a trip to the Symphony with my Dad and Uncle Scott) I'm going to Austin.  Wolf is going to ride back with me on Saturday morning.  We plan on going to the TR game... they're playing Austin Westlake... first playoff game for them.  Should prove very interesting... or very saddening.  Then I think that later on we're (and by we're I mean, Mel, her brother Brandon, Ricky, Wolf, and I) are  going to see 8 Mile.  It looks good... even though I don't particularly consider myself a fan of Eminem.  But, sometimes you have to throw aside indifferences for good cinema, right?  Like when I ended up liking Man On The Moon even though Courtney Love... the evil bitch that killed Kurt Cobain by hiring someone to off him... was a co-star in it.  Yes, I'm bitter that she took away one of the coolest musicians I've listened to... and STILL listen to.  See?  She didn't kill him because he still lives through his music... which is still very popular among kick ass rockers...!  :-)  Anyhoo... okay... so, this weekend should be very very AWESOME!  That's all I have for today.      urlLink  postCount('14Nov02');
