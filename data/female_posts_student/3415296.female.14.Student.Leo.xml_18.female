So's it's been exactly one week since I blogged. Don't worry Joey I got your message. I guess the past week was hectic. With graduation coming along and projects and last minute tests coming in, everything became so confusing. Talking about tests, I have a french dictionary test tomorrow. I forgot to think about 5 sentences that makes me glad there's french in the world. I really don't think it's handy now. I bet Nima's going to kill me now. =). I mean writing 5 sentences about how I'm greatful french is here, is useless. But the language is totally cool. Now I'm sounding like a maniac. Maybe I am. I don't even know who I am.   We let's talk about yesturday since that's the only thing I remember. I went to TandT Supermarket with Karen, Zoe, and Annie. We bought a whole lot of drinks for our 3-D figurine of future york region. I remember after buying everything we had to drink all of it. I think it was around 70 drinks or so. We all had to go to the bathroom at least 100 times after that. I still have to finish up some pop. My stomach is going to explode one day because of all this carbonated drinks. I came home around at 5, and talked to my parents, spending some family time together. I told my parents that I'm really scared about graduation. I'm scared I'm going to let them down. They said they don't care what result I get as long as I tried my hardest, and honestly I have. I've been giving it my all. I know I'm sounding like a person who's in need of an award, but that's not it. My family, from Canada all the way to Korea, is depending on me. I know they don't want to put pressure on me, but I know they want me to get an award. Or at least expect me to get one. I'm so scared. That was pratically all that was going in my head for the past few days. I remember I couldn't sleep these past days. I know, I'm stupid, I don't have a reason to worry because it's only grade 8. But this is something I want to get. My goal. Since I knew my brother got valedictorian, I was so determined to be like him, and my dad. I feel like I can't live up to them. It's hard.  After our conversation and me panicking, I really needed to talk to a friend. I was going to call Nima, but I had a feeling he wasn't home. I went on MSN, hoping Joey or the o4 was on. They were all away. Safee came on. So I said "hey..it's been forever since we talked." He agreed. I don't know. I didn't feel all panicky anymore. Safee didn't even know what was wrong with me. I just, sort of, got calm. My worries just faded. I still never got to tell him what I always wanted to. Tell him everything that was wrong. I still didn't. I don't think I should. I decided this a long time ago. I had to go later on and I said I was sorry about everything. He said wait. I just wrote some dots. He said nevermind and said he'd talk to me tomorrow, which is very unlikly.   I was correct of course. Well, at recess. I was pratically dead. I wanted to lterally sleep outside. I guess I did a little too much thining. So I just put my head down. I heard Safee saying Alice like 100 times. I forgot what I did. I think I was half asleep. Then Erica whispered, "is he trying to get you back or something?". I just chuckled. It was funny. Then Erica and Annie tickled me. Well, of course I laughed and went crazy. Usual me. After that. I don't know where Safee was. I think he walked back to his friends. Well I stood up because I thought we were going to talk. But my instints were incorrect. He walked back to his friends. I guess that's what happens when you're half dead. I talked to him again on MSN. I said "seems like I'm always the one saying hi =P *safee's scared of me*". He said he was "going" to say hi but thought I was ticked off. I was like "ticked off...?" He said "You know, angry, mad, pissed off". Then I said "wow, you really don't know me do you lol" I meant it as a joke. I think he took it the wrong way because he said it was a mean thing to say. I said I was confused. Then he said to pretend that never happened. So I was super confused. I asked Joey, Nima, and Krystal if I get pissed easly. Answers "not exactly, no", "h-e-double hockey sticks no", "no what are you talking about?". I trusted them. They would never lie to me. I told them the story since they asked why I asked. Krystal said that he probably got a bit pissed because we went out, and I just said that he didn't know me. Joey said that he probably took it the wrong way. Nima said that I did the right thing. After that I felt bad. I started blaming myself. It was sort of funny if you think about it. We forgot that happened, but it was still in my head. He asked if I still liked "The Reason". I was like OF COURSE ARE YOU CRAZY? I said the lyrics rocked. He said, "Yea I guess it has a meaning to it." Then he copied and pasted the lyrics and wrote "...". I was like, I wonder what's wrong with him? Maybe the lyrics got to him. I dont know.  Nima had some problems or some worries. I could tell. He wasn't as high as he normally is. I couldn't talk to him because he went offline. Joey will make him smile or get his worries away, so I have nothing to worry about =). O yea, I forgot to mention here, "CONGRATS NIMA, VALE!". And also congrats to Katherine. You guys are cool. hehe.   I have a feeling this blog is really long so I guess I'll end it here.  I just want to say, thanks you guys. You guys are the best. I know I say it everyday and everytime I have a chance, but it's true. Without you guys and everyone else, I'd be seriously, dead. So thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for putting up with my crazy problems. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for being my friend.  Thank you for everything.
