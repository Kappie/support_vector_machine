MY ONE AND ONLY. ONE AND ONLY YOU.  now i know that i know not a thing at all. except the fact that i am yours and that you are mine.  oh.. if you tell me that this wouldn't be easy... and oh.. i'm not one to complain...  i take one step away, then i find myself coming back to you... MY ONE AND ONLY. ONE AND ONLY YOU.
