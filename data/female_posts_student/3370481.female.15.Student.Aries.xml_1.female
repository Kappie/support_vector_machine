Then in art me and ashes had water on our hands and flicked it and a little hit john and he made a fist and threw his arm back and hit me in my nose. so i had 2 go 2 the office and get an ice pack and my eyes were all watering cuz it hurt so bad. now its swelling and gettin shootin pains through it and my dad said i might end up w/ a black eye 2morrow. then ashes wrote tim a note and send it to his class and he came flyin through our class door and was yellin at john for hittin me, he was really upset. john didnt even get in ANY trouble, mrs. lemnah said nothin 2 him at all! then when i got home i went out 2 feed bob the pig and as soon as i step off the back porch it starts pourin then when i finish and get almost back 2 the house it stops!!! haha so 2day hasnt been the greatest....and now i gotta go 2 work so later days, mandy
