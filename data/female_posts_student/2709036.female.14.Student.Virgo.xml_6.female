Thing is, of course there are those who seem somewhat critical about it and the only thing I can and will allow myself to say is that You Need to Open Up Your Minds in Music. . .The thing is that what everyone seems to "like" isn't that much of music man. What seems to be In in mainstream is the whole "I'm a pathetic person/ teenager and no one hears me out as I scream for mercy while cutting my wrists and destroying my body" and the whole "Sex Sells Records!" and also "Half naked chicks are the Only thing a rapper needs for his video to sell along with drinks, diamonds, nice hair, looking as fly as evah, and speaking or "rapping" about nonsense." That's the thing, mainstream loses its sense of what Music really is. Music isn't just a way to show off and seem as if you have a "voice." Music is a form of expression through your voice, your mind, your words, and your hands. Your hands being that most instruments are basically finger functional.   Music isn't what everybody likes or what everybody may seem to want. It's just music, for everyone to hear out and either support or really just leave alone. Just because a person's voice may not seem to impress you or not match someone's voice doesn't mean that they can't sing and need to be banded from it forever. Because, first off[holds up finger, heh heh], they are entitled to their own voice and vocal individuality. Just because some chick doesn't sound like the lovingly synthesised Brittney Spears or maybe Lauryn Hill, doesn't mean she can't sing. Also, if a guy doesn't sound like some other famous well-known male singer, you have to look more closely at it all. For the fact being that the world of music is Not centred around those that are well known. Some would be amazed at the types of musicians that are Real musicians out there. Yet, because they aren't so popular and well known, some just don't give a rat's aaaaaaahh K. . . Anywho, there are soo many views on vocals when it comes to music that it gets to the point were you can't critise a soul if you dared. So really, if you haven't heard "music" beyond people like Ani Difranco, Arto Lindsay, Bjork[couldn't find accent for the "o"], Bitch and Animal and Phish, you really can't say much. Plus, you'll find one}in my opinion{of the true meanings of music, which is the depth of the lyrics and what they say and also the beauty of the song instead of, technically, the person. . .   Anywho^^; I'm just basically saying that I am supportive of him and the band, especially with how they're starting up and all, that type of band needs the most support. That is until I finally know what music genre they are and the type of lyrics they have. Or else, it shall be the end0_0. . .mu ha ha ha. . .
