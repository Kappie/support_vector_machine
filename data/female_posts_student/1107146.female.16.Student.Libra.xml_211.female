My life's work is complete, I have been considered a being of debauchery and rape and scandal and can now die a happy, happy little blasphemous infidel. It's really early in the morning guys, so I'm totally screwed up beyond all comprehension. It's been a day. And I'm trying to write the essay and it's hard because it's a lot to put in and think about. A LOT.  I played Aetolia all day...an offshoot of Achaea. God was it fun, I forgot how fun it was since my old, awesome character got deleted.  I'm such an incredible loser it's not even funny.
