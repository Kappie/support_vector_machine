Anyway, I type in my info, and my result is, "To find a bra that fits you, visit a specialty lingerie shop." Okay, that's a little disturbing.       First of all, it brings back the memories of the horror that was going to   urlLink  local specialty lingerie shop    back home. No offense to them, they're lovely people and good at their jobs...I just don't need strangers putting bras on me all day. And it would be an all-day event. Mom, Grandma, Auntie, my cousin Julie, sometimes my poor poor cousin John, and I would take the trip down there and just spend hours upon hours finding the best bras. Fun for the whole well-endowed family.    Second of all, what am I, a freak of nature? If  LHJ  (which is a very underrated publication) can't give me the answers to bra size, who on earth can? I mean - look - I know I've got big boobs, alright? I would give anything for a B-cup, but that ship sailed about twelve years ago. So I have to wonder, am I just this big weirdo?    Well, then I decided I really wanted some answers. I decided to cheat a little, and go down an inch, and see what they would give me. I wasn't being too careful with the measurements anyway, maybe I was off, please God anything to give me the bosom of a normal, non-gestating human. I got an answer.    30 F.      30 F!!!!      So that settles it, then. I am a freak of nature.              Watching:   about to put on the last disc of  The Simpsons,  season 4, featuring such great episodes as "Last Exit to Springfield," "The Front," and "Whacking Day."      Listening:   "Mr. Blue Sky," by the Electric Light Orchestra.  Also known as "that song that was in the  Eternal Sunshine  trailer but not in the movie."      Reading:   allegedly I'm still reading  Even Cowgirls Get the Blues , but I haven't touched it since the last time I said I was reading it.  I did read  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  today, though.                          *A disclaimer: since I don't actually believe that 30F is a real bra size that has or will ever be manufactured, I don't feel I'm revealing too much here.
