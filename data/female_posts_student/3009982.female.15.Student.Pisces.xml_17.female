He has been talking bout losing weight recently. Hehehe.   For all the 15 years I’ve known him, I still wonder how he copes with his giddy spells and frequent colds and sickness.   This year, 2004 is his 13th borrowed year. Imagine, he was supposed to die 13 years ago. Oops, not supposed to die la, but you know, might have died, if not for God.   Oh dad has been working on a commentary on Deuteronomy. Its been three years since he started, now middle of the fourth chapter. He always says that he will allow God to take him when his work with Deuteronomy is done. Haha, that’s not too long away. But it’s fine. 13 borrowed years of having a dad makes me owe lotsa gratitude already. What else can I ask for?   Meanwhile, I can see dad being sick with the vomiting and stomach discomfort is taking its toil on mom. She doesn’t know what to cook for him- Plain porridge still goes into the toilet bowl. She struggles to drive alone at night to pick me from tuition. She doesn’t drive well at night. I can hear the slight panic in her voice when I call her sometimes.   Pray for dad and mom, please.    -Mary-Ruth
