Just walked in to Lindsay Lohan "serving" her parents (*Note: I OWN the dvd). I know that there will be various posts regarding her invariable "hotness", I know I might be hating but I just don't care, however THIS was said  and it encompassed how I felt  Diane: did you see the lindsay lohan dance? Bassey7: Yeah Bassey7: She wasn't awful Bassey7: She dropped it as though it were hot  I concur.....  2. There is a midget dressed up as a gremlin IN the awards podium. Why do I feel like SOMEONE should be offended by that? and NO I don't have a sense of humor  3.Ok the animation for the Best Kiss Award included a mortician or doctor whatever kissing a corpse ........ok kissing corpses is cool but a tittie on t.v. isn't.......hmmmm yeah   Random note...   what the HELL is a Net Carb anyway?
