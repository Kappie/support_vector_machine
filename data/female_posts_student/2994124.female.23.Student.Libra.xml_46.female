Like sat here this evening I was watching a gorgeous sunset and just though how lucky I was to be alive. And it really makes me appreciate life and want to explore and have more adventures in life.  there is SO much yet to do!  SO...  whilst I'm away I am setting some homework! In no more than 30 words tell me what's so great about our world, Earth and why you wouldn't want to move to the Moon (apparently no-one has actually ever landed on the moon, it was all a con - not sure about that one), Mars or some other planet like the one Mel comes from [Oohh I'm being cheaky now!  I LOVE you really :)]  Can't wait for your wierd and wacky answers!  Unfortunately I can't promise a trip to the caribbean for the winner, but you never know what might just be landing on your doormat if you do win!!
