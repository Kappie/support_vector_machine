All the boys loved her, and the girls loved to hate her. She was like a living Barbie doll, her blonde hair immaculate, her eyelids smothered in blue eye shadow.   I remember shaving the hair off of those disgusting dolls, and then decapitating them. Right now, it didn't seem like a bad idea.  She seemed to haunt me no matter what class I was in. Always there, with the stench of expensive perfume and her voice full of money.   That is, until something happened.
