I sat in my backyard and tried to tan my swimsuit lines, and then i got creeped out because i was topless and my grandma was talking about boys looking over the fence when i went to her house yesterday.  I then came inside and ate an ice cream cone. I then ate another. Then I realized that today is the most hellish boreing day ever. And here I am now. Waiting for a call, somebody to drop by. I almost invite school to begin, just to give me something different to hate.   Today is hot. I'm playing sand volleyball later. It will be hot. I'm talking about weather. I'm bored, and boring.   Its hard to be depressed in the summer. In the winter though you can listen to your sad music, bundle in a blanket and stare into the white void and cry. I went and saw this movie the other day, What the Fuck Do We Know?, it was about quantum physics and such. It sounds hells boring, yes i know, but I actually understood alot of what they were saying. Human emotions can be tamed, turned on and off according to the person. People wouldn't feel such strong emotions unless they were addicted to the way the emotions make them feel. For instance, depressed people don't have to remain depressed but they're so addicted to the feeling that they continue to be negative.  Tres interessante, mes amis.   My dad and Stef are taking a "break"...my dad isn't feeling her as much as she's feeling him...she's talked about the future and marraige and such. I wish my dad would just marry her, I think we'd all be alot happier. I like stef, i like her daughters. It'd be like having an actual family again instead of my pseudo-family that I have now. And Stef cooks...how i would LOVE to have home cooked meals again.  ...I hate guys. rar.
