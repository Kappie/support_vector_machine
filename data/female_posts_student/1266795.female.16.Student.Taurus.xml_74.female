I had fun this morning with VBS, but I am TIRED. I attempted to sleep, but I couldn't. So yeah.  This day's quote is Docendo discimus. Have fun. I'm too lazy to count points right now.  But yeah. Jane: I thought you were coming back the 28th. Welcome home! and Happy belated birthday! Olivia: Yes, I was, and I am, obsessed with ducks. Ask Sarah about my Jungle Duck. (WHich is a big hit!!!!)  THat's all for now. I itch a lot. Evil mosqitos. This post really didn't have a point. Oh well. "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..." (This will be changed soon! Promise!)
