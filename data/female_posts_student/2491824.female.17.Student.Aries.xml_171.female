Wasn't very good.... The plot was good, but that was it. The special effects were bad, the writing was bad, the way it was shot was bad... Pretty much everything was bad...   Dad, Susan, and I went to a stock car race and demolition derby (not at the same time), but, just a little bit after it started, it began to rain heavily...and was cancelled... Bah. Bummer.
