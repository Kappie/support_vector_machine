I"m going with Dacia and my Mom. My mother is worrying about it on how they are loud and just stupid stuff like that. Oh well it's gonna be awesome! Oh hey Dacia if you really did read this next time you talk to me I want you to say the secret word "Micro-Radio" okay? I have no clue how I got that one. Today was boring an average Sunday. I have like 3 reports due in my classes which totally sucks because I just don't care enough to work on them today so mabey I'll just "Forget" that they are due. I talked to one of my best freinds today... (I'm not allowed to say her name but try guessing{hint- look in the quize I filled out})  she said she wasn't wearing under wear or somthing I wasn't really paying any attention. I told her I would right that so yeah duh it's back there. God I keep rambling on and on like a moron I better go before I sound even more retarded ... like the sites name Rated R for Retarded ---- ME!
