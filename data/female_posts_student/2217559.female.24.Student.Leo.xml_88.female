Next friday i will be in Vancouver. then alaska. yippee. i can't wait to whale watch and take tons of photos. i found out aerosmith is playing in houston on june 4th and so is bob schneider. yippee.  that will be cool.   it's been gorgeous the last few days - we are definitely in the mexico season for sure. cabo has been incredible today although i have been watching from inside.  i am too sunburned to venture out to the beach. whew. i didn't sleep well at all last night. just tossed and turned. i went to the crew party after watching monster. wow, what a movie. has anyone seen that movie??? omg, it was incredible. disturbing but incredible. go charlize theron. wannabe lesbo. hehehe.  so, yes, god - i can't wait to see everyone. every night i go to sleep thinking about seeing everyone's faces. it will be strange to be back in austin again.  i have changed so much - still the same person underneath my fancy clothes but just different. i think about things so differently now. even as i sat here today surfing websites that were a daily view for me at eci, i just look at everyone differently. ivalue the friendships i had even more. the relationships. hmm, i am on a soapbox today i guess. must be that inner sunday feeling coming out today.   so, i will go back to the ship shortly. have to meet with the captain at sailing on the bridge to discuss tables for tomorrow night and then i have 2nd seating formal dining tonight. ugh, i never thought i would be so tired of 5 course dining - it just takes so long!! then off to the Newleywed - Not so Newleywed game where i cohost with our cruise director. 10:45 - won't be done until 11:30 -ughhhhhh. then another day of seeing my retarded facial expressions on celebrity tv all day tomorrow. hahahahahahhaah.   ****mental note - don't drink too much wine at dinner tonight.****  Okay, luv you. smooches. Shelly
