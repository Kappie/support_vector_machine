Jeff writes a humor column and a music column for the Features section of the paper. Jeff and Rudy think they are really funny! They're actually not. Last year, there was a guy in this class named John, and he is apparently Jeff's role model, because they cannot go an entire class period without talking about him. The only thing he talks about more than John is music and how awesome everything he likes is and how horrible anything outside of his music tastes is and how retarded people are who like that kind music. Example of his music taste: Rolling Stones, Beatles, Coldplay, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan. I personally have no problems with his music tastes, even though the only band out of those five that I genuinely love is Coldplay. The rest I don't really care about either way. (Except for Bob Dylan, who I hate. He is sort of freakish, especially on the Victoria's Secret commercial.) Going by what I have heard from my best friend Erin, who was friends with John last year, John can't stand Jeff because the ONLY thing he ever talks about... is music. WOW! I know exactly what that is like! Luckily, Jeff isn't obsessed with me the way he is with John.   A typical conversation with Jeff and Rudy: Jeff: John. John John John John John. I like music. John. Rudy: Blues Day is the best band in the world because I am in it, even though I sound like a tortured animal when I sing. Jeff: John likes music. So do I.  Rudy: Blah blah blah about AP Euro. Jeff: John would have taken AP Euro, but he left. John and I like music.  Rudy: Everyone is stupid but us. Jeff: Everyone is stupid but us because they don't have the exact same music taste as me, and John. Rudy: When I am a famous singer, people will wonder how I became famous, because I have no talent. Jeff: I like to make fun of Kaitlyn. Sarah: Oh my goodness, I can't believe you said a whole sentence without mentioning John. There is a God! Jeff:...JohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohn... Repeat x 8 million.  Apparently, John "crashed" his email and made a new one because he didn't want to have to talk to Jeff anymore. Which is something I completely understand the motivation for.
