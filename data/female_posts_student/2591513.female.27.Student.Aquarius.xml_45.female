I love my papa with all my heart and with all that I am.  I know he isn't perfect and maybe my sisters are cringing as they read this, but as much as I hate what he did...I still love him.  I know they do too.  Maybe I have conditioned myself to TRY and not think about it.  I still do and I still wonder...but holding on to that anger won't do me any good.  I think that is what my mom does...maybe it is a coping method I am learning from her.  Anyway, hearing his voice and concern over my health reminded me of how much I still need and want his attention...sometimes I fell as if I am overlooked...like they know I stick around so sometimes they look past me...but talking to him today reminded me of the old papa I used to call everyday at work to talk.  When I was pregnant with Bailey I would call him every day at work.  We would talk for a few minutes everday because my papa hates talking on the phone.  I remember how comforting it was to talk to him.  That is what it gelt like...and it hasn't felt like this in a long time.  So it was nice to talk to him.  I do miss him...his chinky smile...his harsh remarks...his corny jokes...our meaningful talks...our not so meaningful talks...his rude remarks....his funny remarks...his presence.  I miss his presence in our lives....I am sad that he is missing out on my kids.  I always wanted my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents because that is the one thing I lacked in.  Thank God they have my mom.  Well I should end this now...sorry if this was a little gloomy....I just miss my dad.  I grew up with him being gone a lot...I guess I just always thought he would be around when I had my family...and he ends up missing just as much of it....good nite...I should get some rest because I have an appointment to go to.  Been experiencing bad vertigo and headaches...so we shall see what is wrong with me this time...UGH  I love you all for taking some time to read my boring thoughts and ramblings...
