My darling little brother and his boyfriend, both of whom I adore, took me and the two oldest kids and my neice out to dinner last night, and I had several rather large drinks(five kinds of alcohol in each) and came home extremely intoxicated. Now, for most people, three drinks would not be enough to put them over the top, but as I said they were very mixed and very strong, and plus I had not had anything to eat all day, and I didn't eat much at the restaurant. I just had virtually no appetite yesterday. Which I know is not good for my health condition, I should be eating more than I do, but somedays the thought of eating just repulses   me and I can't bring myself to do it. Thankfully, my doctor does not have the faintest clue that I am not eating, as I detest the idea of having to deal with a lecture from him. Bad enough the husband gets pissed when I don't want to eat. Looking around my living room, I am struck by how much stuff there still is that needs to be packed. My huge closet in the hallway is packed full, as is every available shelf in all the bedrooms, and I still have a ton of stuff to get packed up. The books on the bookshelves alone will take up at least six more boxes, and then there is still the books on the headboard of my bed, and in the cabinet above my head on the computer desk. It's gonna take a small fortune to get everything moved, I swear....
