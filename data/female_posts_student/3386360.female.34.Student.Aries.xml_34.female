Slept until 7 when I set my alarm to wake up Ginger down two apartments. I cant wait for the two weeks for Dave to be out. He was sleeping in the livingroom again and that is where Tony sleeps so Tony was up all night long. I made some snide comment about TOny could go get into my bed and Dave got up. I dont know what to think. I know that a part of me should be glad that he is here because I am helping someone but at the same time I am tired of him taking advantage of me. Oh well one day I will learn my lesson. It's just so hard to say no to people without someone there with me. A lesson I guess I need to learn.   I got up this morning and attempted that number again thinking maybe someone would answer. I got the music again. This is so weird. I am finding this an excuse to push down not dealing with Ricky's death.. I'm finding that my new found need to search for another place is pushing down the fear for AC.. that came out wrong but if I have something to think about then I cant think of the million of things I think about for the reason he hasnt contacted me. Will he.. why hasnt he.. is he safe.. is he here.. what is going on.. I find it is easier to not deal with things at this point in time so I find new excuses to not deal with life.    Everyone is sleeping I want to go back to sleep I'm so tired but I know I cant. I will take a nap later today or something. Ken offered to come and visit but I said no. I dont want to deal with things right now. I know he wants to be my friend but I am not sure what else he wants and I refuse to put myself in that situation. He shocked me by talking to me online today and then calling. The yo yo effect is hard and I refuse to do it and now that I have made the choice to stop I feel healthier I'm glad that I was able to do that. The choice was made several months ago and I have felt better about it sense. Though I was hurt he forgot my birthday while insisting I remember his. Oh well that is the type of person he is and i know that I could not work with someone like that.    Ginger gave me the name to a new Doctor. She said she really likes this doctor alot and with all the health issues that she faces it is good for her. I told her what my doctor said about me just having to come to the realization that I will be heavy for my whole life.. I dont except that. I realize i will never be "skinny" but I am not healthy. When I tell my doctor I know osmething is wrong they refuse to listen.. I have to live for my children. So on Monday I will call and see if this new doctor will see me. I hope so becuase from what Ginger says she really listens. One of my biggest issues with my current doctor is the fact I end up on medication and then they take me off it. Medication I should not be off of. Plus they refuse to put me on medication I need. (sigh)    I also have a few numbers I need to call regarding a place. I am not sure how I will do this but it will happen. I keep dreaming that AC will come in and sweep me off my feet and together we will face this and make it easier. I just want and need someone by my side to lean on. I think that is one reason why I am always so tired. Emotional drainage. Well I am going to take a shower then maybe lay back down. Or start laundry who knows.. Depends on how I feel after the shower.    Thank Goodness for this blog I would go inside without it. Though I dont like public publishing I know it is safe anyway.
