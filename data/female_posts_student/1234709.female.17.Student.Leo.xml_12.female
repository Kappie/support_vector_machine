I just wish my parents would back off, and leave me alone. so on sunday when i was supposed to clean the entire house spotless, and the patio, i didnt have time. i cleaned most of the house, and left a note promising to finish the next day. I got home yesterday and the patio was done. My dad said "you wouldnt have cleaned it the way i wanted it done anyhow." like fuck! why would you ask me to do it in the first place if you knew i would screw up like usual? he called me a snotty little bitch again today. that's not suprising.
