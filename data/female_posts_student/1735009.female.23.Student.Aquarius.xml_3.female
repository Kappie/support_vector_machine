So far, no one has taken the survey, which is a downer, but I just have to believe that it's early and people  will  take the survey!  They will!  They don't want to make me cry...  Spent my break searching for jobs, as well as doing homework.  Didn't find many, but I got the updated info on the civil service.  Still have some questions about the application and procedures.  Sometime, when I'm actually awake, I'll read the form in depth.  Sometime.  And for fun....        You're  Waiting for Godot !   by Samuel Beckett     Many people think you're extremely dull, but you're just trying to patient. Really patient. Patient to the point of absurdity, quite frankly. Whatever you're waiting for isn't going to just come along, so you can stop waiting. I promise. Move on with your life. Change of scenery might do you good. Heck, any scenery might do you good. In the meantime, you do make for very interesting conversation.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .
