I would give her a whole thanks but i only saw her half the night. Details later. Anyways for this dance we decided to be the stereotype tarts in the mini skirts and knee high boots. This evening i wore Sarzo's tie up boots (thanx Sarzo), a black mini skirt and a halterneck top with spots. Interesting i know. Anyways we picked up deenie at 7.20 and proceeded to the Kings School Gymnasium. Upon entering we dumped our bags and jackets and in my case jeans. We then went inside and secured the prime position in front of the dj's and speakers. In all, there was about 12 yr 11 bennies chicks.We then danced for a while to really crap music. I then went and got a drink and grabbed my jacket cause i was cold and my top was falling down. I danced a little more then deenie started dancing with some guy who was "16" and in yr 10. I went and got another drink. At this stage i decided to put my jeans on and i made my skirt into a top and i added my jacket. Now for those who don't know my jeans are lblack denium and my jackets blue denium and also for those who aren't style concious they don't mix together. Anyways i kept dancing and keeping a careful eye on deenie and her "lover boy"(sorry deens). Then because my skirt which became a boobtube kept falling down i made it into a belt. (very versatile piece of clothing) and i did my jacket up to make a top. By this trime there was half an hour left and deensta had been dancing with lover boy for over an hour. it was quite amusing as she did nothing much in like 2 hours and yet in five minutes people were all over each other with one interesting case. A one marian gilfedder getting with some year 9. Not on my list of things i ever wanted to see. Anyways about 10 minutes before the end of the dance deenie joined us again. So to deenie i hope you had fun nigelating me and thanks leah and liz for not making an appearance. More stuff happened but my wrist is getting sore so i can't be bothered to type more.  Luv D P.s. You should be nice to poor Charlie he thought you really had something!!
