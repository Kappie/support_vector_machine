Black looks dark gray now.  The sleepover I have been looking forward to SO BADLY has been called off. I've been looking forward to it all week. Well, since I found out anyway. And I wasted TWO HOURS shaving in preparation. Son of a bitch.  I was called arrogant today. Go figure. I've been calling myself that all along, but no one would listen to me. So when I finally manage to convince myself otherwise, it comes back and bites me in the ass.  My back is starting to hurt. Someone just kill me now. This knife looks awfully friendly...
