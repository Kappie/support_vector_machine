Lol...anywayz decided to shift from xanga.com to here, guess im bit sick of that site -)   am feeling high now listening to Kelly Clarkson's Before Your Love .. something bout this song just makes me feel so..ecstatic in a way..its a powerful song, oh well, should i get her album? Gosh, there's so many i wanna get right now, but Kelly is definitely somewhere at the top of the "CD's to get" list   speaking of which, well, dun get me wrong, i dun have anything against Fantasia winning American Idol 3..but i dun see how her style, which is gospel-like, will make it in the charts, save for the fact that she won American Idol, that is. I was actually rooting for Diana, she would have been great in the charts..which is proven already on Amazon.com where Diana is at 4th and Fantasia 5th. i think Diana will outsell Tasia. Not like im planning to get any of their albums though, but if Diana comes out with a mind-blowing song (in Randy's words - "WOW"), then i might consider cuz no doubt she has an awesome voice.   Im still bitter JPL left so early on in the competition. He was like the underdawg, dude ! I raise both my hands and agree that he does not have what it takes 2 win, but hey, he is the dark horse anyway, right? Give him a chance! Ok, i m truly bias to JPL (not to mention utterlly hopelessly into him) hahah! I just feel it unfair when he bounced back from 2 episodes where he did not sing well, and came back with a startling performance of Jailhouse Rock, only to get the boot, when it was clear that Redhead John Stevens was worse than Penpal Jon Peter Lewis. That was totally uncalled for. Now, i can only reminisce the good times of JPL, when he sang Tiny Dancer, Little Less Conversation, Drift Away, She Believes in Me ( SWOON! ) , Jailhouse Rock.   At least i'll get to see him one last time in the Finale, which is like weeks away for StarWorld viewers like yours truly. Bleh . I caught some photos of him on the Net performing during the finale and the redcarpet show. Drop dead Gorgeous if you ask me. and totally clownish prancing around on stage in some yellow t-shirt and white jacket enhanced by black stripes running down the sides of it. and i just noticed, man he's short! =') makes him all the more adorable.
