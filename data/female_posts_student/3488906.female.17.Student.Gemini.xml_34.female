Argh, am a lil stuck. what the heck. -.- Let's start wif my day. Supposed to write PiescesGuy a letter today, but i dont really haf d mood to sit down and write something. I can only be serious when ppl around me are really serious or realy NOT serious.  Went to d library. Drove car today. 2nd drive. it was nice, kinda nervous though. Feel like tellin everybody that i can actually drive a car now, but i dont think it's nice to tell everyone, they'll feel like i'm "showing off" of which i am not. I only wanted to express my feelings , for the sake of sharing. I almost finished biology chapter 2 !!! i must hurry.. must not let that GIRL win me this time ! let's see ! Made some cookies. The kitchen was in a mess though. My wrong. But that's something normal, ppl like me never get things straight, hehe!!! Time for bed though. Will try to jot down everything from now on. Wanna make my life more worthy. Am still trying.   p/s : i got fatter by 1-2kg .. Eeww~ i ate alot ! -.-
