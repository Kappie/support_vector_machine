(to my face) did i mention i'm a paraniod freak? oh shit..the mood and music thing. dammit. forget it.  there is barely anyone on the internet. ben's on. i'm talking to him...i guess everyone else has something to do. and ben has no gas....any ways. i hope there's something to do this weekend. i wish i could get out of my house. and just drive. i don't necessarily care where. just away. drive around aimlessly. why can't my parents leave the car out??? maybe by tomorrow i will be able to take it out whenever. tee hee tee hee. still illegal..but...not as long as i don't get caught. and maybe soon enough..it won't be illegal anymore ack i can't think of nething to say. i'm sorry i'm not very interesting at the moment. that makes me sad.
