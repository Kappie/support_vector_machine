I was really afraid that everyone would beable to see up my skirt, but my friends said that you weren't able to.  I like pulled down my skirt like every 5 seconds cause I was really nervous.  Apart from that, there was basketball, football, skeeball, a velcro-wall, pitching, horrible music, dancing, and FREE FOOD!  I totally pigged out, lol.  There were Dippin' Dots, junk food, soda, pretzals, and more!  Lol.  It was fun hanging out with my friends, considering it's probably like the last time I'll ever hang out with most of them ever again, since most are going to Harriton.  The exceptions are Maggie, Faich, Ariadne, Jake, and some others.  Now that the party is over, I'm sleeping over at Alicia's!  Yay!  Since we weren't actually planning this, I have to wear Alicia's pjs, which are amazingly short on me.  It's kind of funny actually.  But whatever.  Fun times.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
