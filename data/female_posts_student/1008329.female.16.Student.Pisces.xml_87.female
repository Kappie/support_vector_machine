The only people I like talk to are: Narissa, Nelisse, Katie, DAvid, Kelsey(if she's ever on), Matt C., Mathew S., Gabe, Wick and a few others. Everyone else just annoys the fucking shit out of me.   Example(*names have been changed*):   DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:00PM):  HEY ELYSE!!!!!!!  Me(8:05PM):  hello  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:05PM):  WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!  Me(8:08PM):  nothing  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:08PM):  OH MY GOD THE OTHER DAY I WENT SHOPPING AND I SAW THE HOTTEST GUY EVERR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH. HE HAD ONE OF THOSE PREPPY SHAGS. NOT sO Sk8Er Boi MORE LIkE PrEP!  Me(8:12PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:12PM):  I BOUGHT A SHIRT FROM ABERCROMBIE! IT'S SOOOO CUtEe. IT HAS BLA BLA BLA AND IT LOOKS LIKE AVRIL'S!! OH MY GOD!  Me(8:16PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:16PM):  I HELLLLLLA waNT tO GO To tHE LAaaaaaKE. OH MY GOD. IT'S sOooooo FUn ThEre B/c THEre'S heLLLLLLLa HoT GuYS!  Me(8:24PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:24PM):  WeLL I GoTTa MoToR tO tHE CoaTEr..HeheHEeHeHeeh. BYEEEEEE. xOxOX. I lOOOOOVe YoOUU.  Me(8:30PM):  bi  AOL--> The last message was not sent because   DiRtYSkAnKYhoE   is offline.   ....That's mainly how it goes. The person will tell me about their pathetic life or how they think *this guy* is "hott" this week. They have no substance and eventually when I don't join in their conversation about themself they stop talking to me or leave. Ha, it amuses me in some sense. Most times I don't respond but lately I've felt nice.
