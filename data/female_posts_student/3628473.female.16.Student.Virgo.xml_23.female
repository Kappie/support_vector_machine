She is worth more than precious rubies. 11Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life. 12She will not hinder him but help him all her life.20She extends a helping hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy. 23Her husband is well known, for he sits in the council meeting with the other civic leaders. 27She carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness. 28Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her: 29"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!" 30Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. 31Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise. 1 Timothy 2: 10For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do. 11Women should listen and learn quietly and submissively. 12I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. Let them listen quietly. 13For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve. 14And it was the woman, not Adam, who was deceived by Satan, and sin was the result. 15But women will be saved through childbearing[1] and by continuing to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty. Ok So i was sitting down last night before i went to sleep, for about 2 hours, but anyways. And the thought came to me... I'm a woman... (MAn, i feel like a woman!) So yea. i'm sure yal' are thinking, Cassy you just now found that out! I have known that forever. But i looked at it from God point of seeing. And this was all that i found, the verses. And the thought that came to my mind at frist was, wow. Thats alot. Am i really doing all this? Will i be able to? Is t really hard? Well that last question is a no brain... heck yea its hard.But at the same time, if i'm right with god, and wanting him more and more, is it really hard to do that? so yea. Thats just what went through my mind. I want to be a women of God. I want to lift up my God. Now another thing, i was listening to some radio thingy, and a women was talking about something. but it was just gossip. And it was something about a women and the guy was saying soemthing in the effect of women not doing some stuff...That men can do. Now my thinking on it is, i can do anything a man can do. But Thats not the way God made me, i'm thinking. I will, and i hope i do now, put myself under any one. But also under any man. Whatever my dad says, goes. Can tell him what i think, but thats it. As for my husband to be. What he says goes, i will tell him what i think. And something Jerred said to me a while go, keeps coming back to mind. "You will never be able to fully trust your husband/wife, no matter what)" and that makes me sad now. I was to be able to trust my God fully. Which i hope i do. and my husband, being a man that seeks God, should be able to die for me, just like Jesus died for the Church. And i should trust that my husband is putting me above himself. I dont know if that is an unreal thing to think about. I hope not. I really do hope i can trust my husband.  Anyways. Today was a crappy day. i woke up at 3:30 this morning and the bathroom was my best friend. About 6 different times it was my best friend. So yea, i got to see all that i ate for the last 2 months. So yea. That was sad. And i was all alone so, atleast my hair was pulled back! But other then that. Yesterday was great.  O wow... i need to get something off my brain.. I know why i have to much pride and ih ave been looking the gift of prayer... Cause i'm useing it, and i'm not praying for others, and with others. With is a huge thing for some reason. I have no clue why that is. All i know is praying with others is different then praying by myself. Or just talking with god just him and i, or talking with him and i and others. is that right?
