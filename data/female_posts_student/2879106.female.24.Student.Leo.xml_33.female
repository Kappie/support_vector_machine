I have been working a lot lately, I have seen Alek a couple of times this week, and the rest of the time I sleep, eat, read, or watch TV. Nothing all that exciting has been happening. I am starting to get used to working full time and although I hate it, I think I am going to be okay. I just need to get very used to this because as soon as school starts I am not going to have any fun time at all. But that's cool because Alek will be at NIU so I need a lot to keep my mind off him being gone. Other than Alek leaving, another thing that I am not going to like when school starts is that I won't have any time for all of my friends. Actually me and Alisha will see each other more during school than we do now. This is a great thing, but I won't see Amanda near as much. I am doing my best to see her as much as possible in order to make up for the absence during school.         I have had so much on my mind lately. A lot of it I don't really want to talk about on here because I don't want anyone to read about it. I do know that if there is anyone out there that is reading this and would like to talk to me I would really appreciate it if you would e-mail me and let me know. I have a lot of friends but that doesn't mean that I can afford to lose any of them. Well I guess that is all that I want to say about that. I love you all and I couldn't live without any of you.
