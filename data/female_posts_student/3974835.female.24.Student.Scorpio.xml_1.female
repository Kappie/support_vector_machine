My dad, who had cancer for a year, died on May 04, 2004. It was the worst day of my life. The whole process of watching him die hascracked my very being. I think that I will get over it in time...not get over it...bad choice of words...learn to be without him. If that even makes sense. I only have one sibling, David, and he is in the Army as well. He came back from Afghanistan when our dad died. I know this bothers him but we love each other so much that we don't turn to each other to grieve.  Then my husband got the news that he was chosen to spend 18 months in Afghanistan. His military pay will be enough to keep us afloat financially while he is gone, but as a family missing him is hard on all of us. He has two children from a previous marriage and his ex wife goes beyond the call of duty to make life a living hell for us. She has taken a particular offense to me being alive. He and I have one child and then I have one from a previous relationship. Total of 4, but 2 that are with me 24-7. This deployment is harder than I ever expected.  As much negative as there is going on currently I am trying to find ways to keep some positive flow to things. I paid a personal trainer and am trying to get into shape. I am still working on my degree(s). I am spending a lot of time thinking about who I am and what I want my life to mean and be about. Trying to sort out the spiritual side of me.   This is my first posting, hopefully I will pull it together more and more as time goes on.
