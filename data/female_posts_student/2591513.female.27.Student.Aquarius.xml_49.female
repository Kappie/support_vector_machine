I am going to wacth it in a few minutes, but I thought I would remind you about this movie.  I remember watching it in high school and being completely moved by it.  Oh high school, so long ago....  Damn...10 year union around the frickin' corner...and here I thought I would be done with college...LMAO  Well I got the family down...college is almost there.  NITE!
