I know, I know I am obviously very anal about it but the color stands out and I just wanted to even things out. :) BTW, did you get my email. I kept on getting forwarded emails from you but it wasn't addressed to me. I am worried that I also have that email virus that you are talking about. Do you still have the link to fix it? Thanks!
