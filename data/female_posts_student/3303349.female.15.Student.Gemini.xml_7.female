Now I won't be stuck listening to Good Charlotte. Makes me happy. (Wide range of emotions today) I should probably go practice. I have a piano recital tomorrow night. I am preaty much ready but there a few flaws in my music that I need to smooth out. All State tapes are due June 9th(reminder to myself and just to let you know how lopng I have untill I start flipping out over a preformance again.)
