[Being wrong never felt so good... :) ] So, my mom came home from the beach today and we are totally out of food so she decided to go to the store. I was like "woohoo! Something to do finally" As it turns out we were just going to freddys! Mwa haha! We went to Wal-Mart and I got a AWESOME cowboy hat. It makes me look like a total hick!!!!!!!!! Then I went to the boys section [why should only boys get the cool clothes???] and I got three blue t-shirts.  Then we hopped in the car and went to target!!! There I got awesome hello kitty hair clips! They were in the little girls section! Woohoo! Then we went to Winco and we got a toooonnnnn of grocerys! I was in the cooking mood so I was like "Mom can I get some stuff for a key lime pie?" and she was like "Of course!" well..now that I think about it she probably said something like "O.K." but still.... So I got alll the stuffff.  Then by the time we got home it was about 9:30. The reason I got my three, blue, boys t-shirts was for camp! See, I am on the blue team and I was looking in my closet and I realized I  didn't have very many blue shirts. So I got those three shirts and ironed of fun stuff with these cool iron on letters. My three shirts say: "Woo blue," "I love blue and blue loves me," and "blew" Hahhahahaha. I had to do the last one that way because I ran out of Us and I wanted to say something about blue. My sister told me to spell it was way and it looked cool!  But, on the "I love.." one I messed up. Haha. I took of the little iron on paper stuff for a couple letters but then I re-ironed another part and by accident I iron the letters so they smuged. My mom was like "AHHHHH!!! YOU PROBABLY BROKE THE IRON!" and I was like "I have   everything   under control! Haha [that didn't make much sense but it sounded good in my head...]  I totally need to take a picture of my rockin shirts! But, I have gotten complaints about the long load time of my site so I doubt I will.  At about 10:15 my brother, Jacob, was like "I am going to the astronomy shop!" and I was like "Ooooh! I wannnna goo!" and Jacob said "Ok!" So we both hopped into the truck and headed towards the astronomy shop. But this isn't any ordinary astromy shop. Every night it's like a star party and science geeks just hang around outside looking at starts for hours.   It was awesome! I was the only girl so that was kinda weird. Haha. They were all like making jokes about smart stuff and everything. Haha. I wish I didn't have such a bad memory or I would post some of there conversations.. I saw SO many stars! I saw like 3 "globular clusters" they had funyn names! The ones I saw were like M-52, M-12, and M-47. They were named by like this guy in the 1700s who discovered them. He discovered 110 object in space that are like the 110 most easily seen things when your looking into the sky.   I also saw another galaxy! It was tilted on its side so it was like a straight line but it was still cool. Then I saw this star that glowed red! It was cooooooool! Then I saw this nebula. Pur-tay!   It was a lot of fun! I can't wait until I discover my plant! Fantora, here I come!!   Today my brother, Matt, and I were talking about hockinson and You can get our own personalized parking spot and I was like "You should get one Matt!" and he was like "Okay! But were NOT naming it Fantora." I laughed.  I guess that's it.  I wuv you guys!  Laura Fantora
