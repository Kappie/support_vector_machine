I am Calling Calling now, Spirits rise and falling To stay myself longer...    Calling, in the depth of longing   To stay myself longer...     Stand alone... Where was life when it had a meaning... Stand alone... Nothing's real anymore and...  ...Endless run...  Calling Calling, For the place of knowing There's more that what can be linked  Calling, Never will I look away For what life has left for me Yearning Yearning, for what's left of loving  S Megami sama...
