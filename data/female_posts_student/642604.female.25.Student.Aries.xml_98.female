So finally we drop Leigh off in Arlington, I then drive Kevin home and then Eric. I get home myself at 5:15 and have 30 minutes before I have to get back in the car to drive and meet Leigh. So after having a cigarette with Toni, showering, shaving and changing I was out the door in 30 minutes. I went by the bank and headed to Arlington again. Leigh drove this time, thank god, I was so tired of driving! We got into Clarendon, exhausted, and stood in line at IOTA to get in to see Pat McGee. We got there around 6:30PM, we stood in line till like 8:00PM. We were towards the front though. We sat there the whole time listening to this guy in front of us going on and on about Pat this and Pat that... maybe he knew him, I don't know and after awhile I was just annoyed. So Leigh and I talked for an hour and a half and then finally got in. We were expecting more than we saw. It was tiny. The place was so very small. We originally staked out a place against this random wall in the middle of the room. I started drinking (despite the fact that I wasn';t going to) and we waited. Andy from Earth To Andy came on and played some acoustic stuff. This girl next to us was either a die hard fan or a friend of his because while everyone else talked through his performance (they were rude) she just stood there mystified. Leigh and I felt kind of bad for her. So then he finishes and Leigh says he wants a cigarette so we look around and no one near us is smoking. We see some people in the far corner of the room smoking and make our way across the floor to them. So we stand there and immediately make friends with the guys around us. We start talking about the band (Pat McGee), Dave Matthews, Jam Band festivals, Widespread... we all click. Then the band comes out and they hang over by us for a little while. We realize we're next to all their friends and family. Due to our new location we got to interact with them when they weren't playing and it was such a much better location since even though we were off to the side we were right up against the stage. Since the place was tiny they were only like five feet from us. It was way too cool. Leigh and I had the best time. They played incredibly and their friends were so much fun. Everyone was so into it! I have to admit I had a much better time that night than I did the night before at Dave... blasphemy, I know. So they played for like three hours straight and by the end of the night we were flying high on energy. Finally we took off when it was all over. The band was going into Georgetown and had invited those who remained in the audience to go but Leigh and I were SOO TIRED! So I got home around 1:30 AM. I crashed hard. The next day I woke up and went to lunch with Mom and Nancy at Flat Tops... SO GOOD! Then we went to Foxes Music and then played music back at Nancy's house forever. Mom bought me so much stuff!!! Then I went home, pulled out the guitar and began to reteach myself. My fingers are now killing me. But I have to say it was one of the best weekends I had ever had! I just had fun! But now back to reality where I am sitting here at work on a Wednesday wishing the weekend would come!  [ Wed Jul 17, 11:32:43 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] VA Beach continued....  So, after the concert ends we all sit around on the lawn for a while admiring how soft the grass is and noting how trashed the place is, someone likens it to the mall on Earth Day. We finally make our way to the parking lot thinking we're going to be there for a while. But we actually got out of there quickly (by quickly I mean it took 30 min instead of the 90 it takes to get out of Nissan or RFK.) So we start driving and I am so hungry since it's like 11 and I haven't eaten since 2. At first everyone is like "go to McDonalds." I kept saying we should find a waffle house or a dennys or someplace I could get breakfast. They didn't like that idea till we started driving... suddenly everyone wanted breakfast and everyone was on the lookout for a place to go. We drive past our hotel because I knew I had seen a bunch of retail plazas past our hotel earlier. We find a denny's and go nuts. We're way too excited over cheap breakfast food. So everyone orders meat, except me who orders basically eggs with cheese and hashbrowns. OH! Grey Street just came on while I'm writing this... YAY!!!! "She says nothing of what she thinks..." Anyway, so we eat and Kevin tells us this passionate tale (he's really drunk still) about Vanilla Coke that has Leigh and I rolling and when Eric gets back from the bathroom he retells the whole story for him, which keeps me laughing all over again. The food tasted so good. We go back to the hotel, exhausted... Eric and I go up to our room and I decide I want a cigarette so I go down... "Oh there's an emptiness inside her and she'd do anything to fill it in, and though it's red blood bleeding from her now, it's more like cold blue ice in her heart, she feels like kickin' out all the windows and setting fire to this life... she could change everything about her...." Sorry. Anyway, so back to the story... so I go down and hang with Leigh and Kevin for a minute since they are in a smoking room and then head to the front desk to ask for shampoo since their sign says if you forgot anything, ask at the front desk... they don't have shampoo. So I go back up to the room and Eric and I are watching Iron Chef. I finally fall asleep before I see who wins. I wake up in the morning and Eric has to wake me up twice before I actually get out of bed, he, magically has found shampoo in his travel case. But it strips my hair completely but whatever... so we go outside and it's raining. I go wake up Leigh so that we can jump his car. He tries to get Kevin up. We all hang out and wait for Kevin to GET THE HELL UP!!! He finally comes crawling out and they check out of the hotel as we did earlier. So then we try to jump Leigh's car. It won't work, we try a couple more times and nothing.... so then we do everything we can to figure out what to do, we finally find a phone book and there isn't a single Chrystler dealer in the area so we would;ve had to drive to Suffolk, Norfolk or Chesapeake. Leigh calls AAA and I am looking over some buildings and notice that there is a sign WAY in the distance that looks like a Chrystler sign. So Eric and I decide to drive down and see. We take orders for breakfast because at this point we are starving and we jump in the car and drive off. We find a Dodge dealership, a Merchants Auto Center and a Chrystler dealership... we are so proud. We call Leigh to tell him about them all but that the only one open on Sunday is Merchants. We get breakfast and by the time we get back Kevin tells us that Leigh has already gone with the tow truck guy and they are stopping at Merchants. So we get in the car and go to Merchants and wait for Leigh. He has to leave his car down there because they can't get to it till the next day. We get in my car and take off for home. We sit in massive traffic, not to mention the rain... did you know you can see the roads better in rain if you are wearing polarized sunglasses??? I didn't. We stop off for gas at a gas station that is ten miles off of 64 and three out of the six pumps aren't working... then we get back in the car and we head to Richmond so that we can eat at this diner that Eric loves. (We used to go there all the time when he was with Bobby but he never gets to go anymore...). Finally we get back on the road and Eric drives.... [ Wed Jul 17, 10:57:55 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] VA Beach   So after having a restful evening at home ALONE!!!! on Friday night I got up on Saturday, packed, picked up Eric and met with Leigh and Kevin at their apartment. We programed cell phone numbers and everything seemed peachy. Leigh, being the brilliant guy that he is, printed two copies of the directions and gave me one. Everything seemed to be perfect... we went down 123 with no problem, hit 95 and of course hit some bitch on a cell phone as we were merging on... well we didn't actually hit her but we had to deal with her. Eric, in the passenger seat, and her had an all out war as far as symbols and yelling goes. Kind of funny, but definitely not a good way to start the trip. So I get on the cell phone and call Leigh to make sure he made it onto 95 since he hadn't ever gone the way we took him and since he was behind us and we couldn't see him. He had. Things were good, we were cruising down 95, both cars were doing well, and the evil cell phone bitch had gotten off the road at an early exit. Then all at once we hit traffic and we hit it hard.... and we stayed in it off and on (mostly on) the entire way to VA Beach. At one point on 64 I actually pulled over to the side of the road and told Eric to get the hell in the drivers seat because I couldn't handle it anymore!!!!! Five minutes after he got in and started driving he was pissed off. Eventually we had to stop for food because we were going to kill everyone on that road we were so frustrated and hungry. So we get back in the car and I go to sleep. The next thing I know we're getting onto 264 and we're almost there.... I slept through the tunnel traffic!!! So we get there and we're about to turn into our hotel parking lot when Leigh (who had previously called to tell me he made it to the hotel 10 min before we got there) called again to say we needed to go get beer because his car wouldn't start. Damn. But we think it just needs a jump which we can do later so Eric and I go get beer. We get to the hotel, check in (it's not God awful but it's so very much worse then I expected... of course I am used to being in really nice hotels for work), and then we have to turn around and leave right away for the concert. We get there and have to park all funny because they let too many cars down that row. But whatever. We go find a friend of Leigh's who is hanging with this very cool chick and everyone clicks and has a good time hanging out in the parking lot. Then we all decide to go into the concert and we all hang out on the lawn, again having a good time. I am not drinking since I am not allowed to till I get this test done... (of course I ruin that the next day but whatever) but everyone else is getting plastered and it is hysterical... so Norah Jones comes on and she just rocks! Her voice sounds exactly like her cd, I was just so impressed with her. It was nice to finally have a really good opening act (although nothing beats Ben Harper a couple of years ago) and Leigh tells me then that Dave Matthews will take the stage at like 8:05 PM. He's drunk, he doesn't actually know this but he is sure he is right... 8:05 rolls around and no Dave. HAH! Anyway, so Dave comes on and I'm all psyched and the whole time I've been saying how I want them to play three songs... Two Step (everyone knows this is my all time favorite Dave Song), Grey Street (My new favorite Dave Song) and Watchtower (my favorite cover that Dave does). They kick off the concert with Grey Street! I went ballistic! I was so excited and everyone in the group was like "Erin, you have to be so excited over this!!!" I so was. So then they do a few other songs, excellent as well, and then one of Leigh's friends asked me if I dance and I said I don't because I suck but if they play Two Step, I'll go nuts! Leigh turns to me when that song ends and says, "they're going to play two step next...." he was actually just telling me this so that I would be pissed off when they didn't play it next (remember Leigh is drunk and his logic is completely skewed!) And suddenly those familiar notes float up through the air.... IT WAS F*$KING TWO STEP!!! I went insane and hugged Leigh! And anyone who knows me, knows I don't hug unless I'm drunk... which I so wasn't. They jammed on it forever and it was SO GOOD! I couldn't get over how amazing both Boyd and Carter were... INSANITY!!!! They were just so into the music that every time you caught a glimpse of them you just felt their energy. Then they did some other good ones through the show, Raven, Grace is Gone as well as many others, and they just rocked on both Jimi Thing and Ants Marching... again it was insane how good they were! They just went on forever. So then they leave the stage and they stay off for a really long time, I think I burned my thumb on my lighter from holding it for so long... So then they come back on and kick right away into Watchtower. Well it was all over for me... I heard them all and every one I wanted to hear was just played so intensely and so amazing. They played on Watchtower for quite a while and it was just brilliant! But then they were done. I don't think I've ever been to a Dave concert where they've only played one song during their encore. We were all kind of left shocked. They were so good so we couldn't really feel disappointed but we were left feeling slightly unsatisfied... it was weird... the concert was so good but we didn't know what to think with only one song in the encore... [ Wed Jul 17, 10:15:29 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Update on Burger King   Again, I needed to grab something quickly yesterday so I went out to Burger King during my lunch hour to get a veggie burger... again I pulled up and gave my order (Not hard, veggie burger, Plain with ketchup; and a diet coke) and again they repeated it back to me... again I pulled up to the window... but this time I almost took the food and left but I thought... maybe I'll check. So I asked before they handed me the bag, "that is a veggie burger right?". Her response? "No, it's a double whopper with cheese." WHAT???? She gave me attitude when I told her that wasn't what I ordered and she was like "Well, what do you expect?" I was like, what if I was allergic to red meat??? Then what??? She didn't know what to say. Needless to say, I got my veggie burger...
