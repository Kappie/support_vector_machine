I felt like posting again, though, and this seemed a good thing to comment on.   Does anyone else out there watch  Jeopardy ? I love it. It's especially thrilling because I'm 14, so I'm kind of handicapped, but I still occasionally know things that the contestants don't. Nothing like a little intellectual superiority. This week they're having this 'Power Players' thing. All the brightest minds of the political scene- at least, all those that have nothing better to do than compete on a game show- compete for $$$ for the charity of their choice. It's like the  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?  celebrity edition, except with Ari Fleischer instead of [Insert name of dorkus pseudo-celebrity here]. So, yeah. Today it was the political thing and Alex Tribek cracked on this guy's relationship with his wife. Yes, Alex Tribek  cracked  on someone. Bizarre, I know. So the guy was just standing there looking kinda pissed, and then Alex tells him to laugh it off. Somehow the situation digresses until the contestant is pretending that he has to be held back (you know, like he's trying to go after Tribek) and Alex is all, "You want some of this?" Seriously, he said that. I was rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. Well, rolling on the couch, actually. Speaking of which...   I made a discovery the other day. It was a pathetic, very me discovery, but a lightbulb moment nonetheless. You know that annoying ROTFLMAO thing people use when they post online? I knew what the first 5 letters stood for, but the last three were a total mystery. Chairman Mao? Mayonnaise? I had no clue. But then the other day I had a total epiphany. It came out of nowhere:  my ass off ! Rolling on the floor laughing  my ass off ! When I figured it out I started yelling very loudly and laughing- I'm fairly certain my family thought I was insane. It takes very little to make me happy.
