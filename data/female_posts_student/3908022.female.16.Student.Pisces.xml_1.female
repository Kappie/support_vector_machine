Who else, me and my fucking bad luck?  It's not so bad, though. Not really. I mean, the things I get to do are not disgusting or actually hard in anyway at all. Actually, all I get to do is make beds, make porridge, sandwiches, water the flowers, feed the cat and the fishes, do the dishes and feed one of the people who live there. The staff is really nice to me and I'm very well taken care of. The old people, though they all have some sort of mental illnesses, they are really nice and charming. That's not the problem either, and I have no problem whatsoever with feeding them or talking to them or anything.  No, the thing that makes me uncomfortable is on a whole other level.  It's that feeling I get, when I go in to Agnes'(one of the ladies there, she's in a wheelchair. She can't walk, and can barely move at all, except her arms.) room. I go over to her window and spot the row of framed pictures. My eyes stop at her wedding picture. There's no actual way to know that it is her, but I assume so. The beautiful woman I the picture with the perfect smile, joy shining from her face. Her eyes were so alive and she was healthy. She was sane, she was young and unspoiled. And I go to the dinner room where Agnes now is sitting. I see the same eyes, instead of joy they seem dead. The spark in that picture is long gone.  That feeling is what I can't stand. That feeling of seeing what they have become, understanding, having to realize that for some people that's the way of life.  Agnes is now the woman who forgets what she's eating in between chews.   Signe is another old woman there. She always repeats anything you tell her. Sometimes she answers, but not often. Her husband came to visit today, Signe didn't even acknowledge his presence. After a while, she noticed who he was and said "Are we going home soon?".  As if they were both going home and as if everything was normal again.  I sat there next to her with tears in my eyes. I don't know how to do this. I need help. I need someone to help me through this. I can't do it by myself.  I just can't.
