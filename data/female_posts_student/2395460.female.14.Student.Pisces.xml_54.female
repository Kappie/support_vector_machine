The stovetop variety is cheaper and gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you're actually cooking (though it doesn't have that effect on me, and I think it tastes like shredded cardboard).  But I have encountered many situations where I have to feed someone in just three minutes, or have to pack a lunch on the run (we don't do sandwiches at my house, I don't know why), and on those occasions, I congratulate myself for having the foresight to purchase these little packages of Japanese microwavable rice at my local Asian market (you can also get them online at  urlLink Midori Mart ).  And unlike the stovetop variety available in your regular grocery store, this rice looks and tastes like real Japanese steamed rice.  It's nice and sticky and won't fly off your chopsticks
