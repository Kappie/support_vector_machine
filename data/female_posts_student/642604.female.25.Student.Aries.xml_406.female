By the way click on the title of the entry to see how a "tool" is defined.  #1 - Don't drive around a piece of crap that says "VGY PWRD" cause basically you're telling me right then and there that if I become a vegetarian I can drive a piece of crap and look like well... a tool.  (I so wish I had had a double quarter pounder with cheese and bacon and ham and pork to throw on his windshield.) (this is the only one not related to a certain person I am gearing all of these toward)  ***DISCLAIMER - this has nothing to do with vegetarians JOANN this is only for that damn car I was stuck behind at lunch today***  #2 - If you can't do something, admit to not being able to do it.  Don't sit around and tell others that you can do something just because you think it's cool to be able to do it. I'm pretty sure that no one is the greatest soccer player to live, can play perfect Chopin on the piano, wrote the best great american novel ever, can calculate any number known to man in an instant, can cook better than my boy Wolfgang, can cliffdive better than professionals, can win the Indy500, can sketch better than Davinci, can read an entire collection of Shakespeare in a day, and won six Oscars for one role just because the critics loved them that much!  SHUT THE F UP!   #3 - Think things through.  Don't go around telling people about your sorority hazing experiences because a) those of us who didn't join and never would join a sorority think you probably had to buy your friends anyway (not that that's the only reason to join) b) don't tell people about people drawing fat circles on you to conjer up sympathy because really you're just giving me a visual that is gonna make me laugh at you for years to come c) you're just advertising reasons for those of us who hate sororities to REALLY hate your sorority cause they let you in!  #4 - Just because someone is telling a story that you think would coincide with one of your own DOES NOT mean you should jump in there and offer up your story.  Sometimes?  Yes.  All the time?  No.  And by the way, don't be one of those one-upper tools either... EVERYONE hates those.  #5 - No one likes a breast pump.  Not even for those of you who have dared to have children.  No one likes a breast pump pulled out for the world to see whether you are going to use it or not.  Put the breast pump in a hidden place and only take it out in public when you are locked in a restroom stall.  Besides... I'm sorry, did you actually have breasts?  I must've missed them.  #6 - Just because you are married to someone I work with (who I don't even talk to) does not give you the right to just butt in and talk to me.  It could cause me serious pain in the end, like I don't know... say wanting to bolt so badly I forget my wallet in a rest stop... which would make me basically hate you for the rest of my life and knowing if you ever gave me any reason... I WOULD END YOU!  (I threw that in for Mike... not that he ever reads this)  #7 - Don't laugh.  You possibly have the most shrill annoying laugh anyone has ever heard.  Do you take joy in knowing that slowly you are shattering ear drums all over the world?  #8 - Now this right here is a gift... this is a moment when I will tell you something that will really give you the upper hand and put you on your road to recovery... DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BEFRIEND OTHER TOOLS!  First off, you married one, you're already a moronic tool.  You annoy the crap out of me therefore you are the toolbitch from hell.  But to befriend two of the biggest tools EVER TO WALK THE EARTH?  You have got to be the supreme ruler of all time TOOLS!  #9 - Learn your opinions don't matter.  I don't care.  If you said you loved Dave Matthews Band I would gladly give his music up for the rest of my life rather than actually have something in common with you.  In my case, ignorance is bliss.  Let's keep it that way.  #10 - Accept you're a poser.  Accept you are a loser.  Accept that you need to learn to be the happy housewife with your tool husband and your tool kid and your tool friends and you must never never come out of the house again.  We already have to deal with the husband... isn't that affliction enough?  Haven't you all punished the rest of us enough?  Stay inside, embrace delivery, online shopping, sunrooms, etc... NEVER EVER STEP BEYOND YOUR FRONT DOOR AGAIN!
