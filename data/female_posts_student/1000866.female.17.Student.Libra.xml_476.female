We basically just walked around all day, went around to the piazza Navona and my parents went off somewhere and I just sat at one of the fountains for a bit writing in my journal. Then, this kid came up to me. He was so nice and it was so funny. He like...couldn't speak English that well, but well enough. MUCH better than I can speak Italian haha. So, I talked to him for a bit (and then his friend who came up after about five minutes) and then I left them and went with my parents and we just walked up and down the streets looking at all the shops. Then my mom and I split up from my dad and we went shopping. AH! So much fun. And, the Via Veneto, and the Via Corso are amazing. There are so many people and so many shops and it just...rocks. Haha. My mom and I umm...definitely didn't get lost on the way home. We just took sort of...an alternate root. Heh. Whooops. Oh well. We finally found our way back to the apartment, and now I'm like...exhausted so I think I'll go sleep now. We're waking up at like 6:30 to go to the market which should at least be interesting. :) Then, we're going to the forrum and the Colosseum tomorrow then maybe to buy the dress I realllly want tomorrow. I think it's what I'm going to wear to Winter. YaY! Well, I'm off to sleep. That's so weird loooking down at the bottom of the computer where it says it's 2:25 and here it's 9:25. Crazy stuff. Ah well, good night.
