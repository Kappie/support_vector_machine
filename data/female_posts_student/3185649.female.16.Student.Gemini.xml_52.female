We were supposed to go swimming but it rained and thundered. And we were going to have more people, but they're all either out of town, at Super Summer or recovering from jaw surgery. But it wasn't all that lame really.   Especially when we decided it would be fun to go tping. Pretty much everyone here tonight (all except one person) went to Costa Rica on our mission trip. And we thought it would be great to go tp our leaders' house. But since it's been raining my parents were like please just fork it. So we agreed to that. But then things got weird. Cause Wayne and Rexanne live far away from everyone and curfew and Austin couldn't drive me and then Brittany couldn't drive me home, although she could drive me there... Yea. So my mom was like why don't we not do this tonight. I went and whined a little, because hello? Everyone was together and it was perfect. So they let us go.   We didn't fork it cause we didn't have time to get forks. Not to mention Opie had 24 rolls of TP in his trunk and a launcher. So we tped it instead. Let me say, for them only having one tree and a couple bushes, an hour and24 rolls,it was awesome. We chalked the driveway and left two cones. Cause you gotta leave the cones. And then Brittany hit the window with a roll and we took off down the street to get in the cars. On the way back we all honked and suddenly someone runs out into the road. It was Wayne. He jumps on the hood of our car and just sat there. But finally he got off and we left.   I got home and got yelled at for putting my parents on the spot. Then I got yelled at for TPing when I said it was just forking. Then I was told 'well I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it cause that will be your last time.' 'my last time this summer?' 'Ever. Until you move out and are 18 and can get caught by the cops without us being responsible'   I can't go TPing ever!!! I mean, I love my parents and I respect them and try to obey them cause that's what God calls all children to do. But I feel like sometimes i put up with some pretty lame rules from them. I can't see PG13 movies without approval. I can't drive with other teenage drivers (except for things like tonight). I won't get my license until I'm 17. I couldn't date or go to any dances until I was 16.   And now I can't go TPing. Maybe it's because I went forking once already this week. Maybe I shouldn't have whined when my mom said no. Maybe I didn't make myself clear on how much it meant to me when my dad said yes. Was I ungrateful? Uncaring? Surly? I love my parents but this is too much. Way too much.
