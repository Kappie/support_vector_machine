I laughed last night when I noticed that I was eating out of an enormous vat of potato salad.  Okay, so it wasn't a "vat" persay, but it was a lot of potato salad.  I ate probably half of the bucket and then took it back downstairs.  A few minutes later I was burping and it smelled so bad that it was hilarious.  (If you haven't noticed, I laugh at myself a hell of a lot.) My cat even thought the burp smelled bad because she woke up and looked at me with her ears all flattened back on her head.  I burped again a few minutes later and I wouldn't be surprised if I woke the neighbors with my horrible giggles.  This was all last night mind you. Today I didn't get up till prolly 2 in the afternoon.  I opened my eyes and looked at the sky out my window.  My bed is perfectly level with the bottom of my window so all I have to do is roll over and I can look right down onto the street.  I looked at the sky and thought it looked about like it was 10 in the morning, then I analyzed how tired I felt and considered it to be about 11 am, then I considered the weather and how that would effect everything (It was all rainy and drizzly out, I positively love this weather), and I came up with the conclusion that it was about 10:30 am.  This was all before I looked at my watch and realized that it was 2 o clock.  I took the hottest shower of my life today.  I turned the water on as hot as it could go and just stood there trying to stay awake.  Oh! My fish died today, or last night, or whenever.  Lois died.  The stupid.  Clark, being the superhero that he is, is still alive and kicking, or flipping, or whatever fish do.  I figured that my cat, Linsey, is Lex Luthor in disguise and killed Clark's lover, Lois, in order to get to Clark, because Clark and Lex are the ultimate nemesises.  Then I laughed some more at the imagination that I have. I was very proud of myself the other day.  Kaitlin, Amanda (who is Kaitlin's 13 year old cousin), and I went downtown at prolly 10 pm, because we had nothing else to do and we were going to go find something to do.  (I was going to stand in front of the map at the clock tower and point at a spot with my eyes closed.)  Instead we made up this imaginary treasure hunt.  I was just picking random numbers and saying that we had to walk that  many steps in that direction.  Then we would look for imaginary clues that would tell us where we need to go next and such.  It was fun.  On our way back to the car we met other people in our grade (We actually saw people we knew during the treasure hunt too, I forgot to put that in.)  It was Kristin and Stephanie, they are the type of girls that worry about what they look like, and who they are going to have sex with next.  My dad says that my description of them is exaggerated, but I don't think so.  But seeing them while we were just ending our wonderful little imaginary treasure hunt made me realize how different Kaitlin and I are from other girls our age.  We just spent over and hour playing a game that most people stopped playing once they discovered puberty.  I was so happy that we maintained at least some level of innocence as we went through, and are going through, adolescence.  I hope I never lose that last little shard of innocence that lets me play games and be young. I was waiting for dad to take me home from Vicki's house last night and I was playing Indiana Jones in the backyard around the car.  I was pretending that the mummies and the zombies and the tomb raiders were going to get me.  I felt stupid, but I knew that nobody could see me, and just had fun for 5 minutes or so.  And I love singing the Indiana Jones theme song. Gotta love the George Lucas.  I just noticed that I am wearing one of my many Star Wars shirts while I hum the Indiana Jones theme song.  Sigh.  John Williams and George Lucas are a filmmaking match made in heaven. I drew a picture today.  It is of Tom Welling.  Once I find my tranfer cable for my digi camera I'll put it up. (the scanner was a no-go, damn thing)  I used a charcoal pencil. I haven't drawn with one of those in a forever.  But yeah. Has you ever read the book "The Westing Game"?  Its sort of a kids' book, but I was looking through my bookcase downstairs while my dad was hooking up the vcr  to tape the news (my aunt and uncle were gonna be on it showing the boats that they make.  Here's their website   urlLink http://www.vmgskiffs.com/   , you should seriously look at these boats.  They're beautiful. Its called the Swift Solo, a one man sail boat) anyway.  I was looking through my downstairs bookcase and I found a bunch of the books that I loved when I was younger so I brought them upstairs to put in one of my bookcases up here.  I have a lot of books.  I read an insane amount of books. no joke.  Anyway, if you ever want a quick fun read, I recommend "The Westing Game" by Ellen Raskin. Super good mystery type thing with a bunch of fun twists, and very clever. Speaking of books has anybody, by chance read "Grapes of Wrath" and want to tel l me about it? I can't seem to get through it. The skin on the insides of my wrists is all smooth and painful from me typing and sliding my hands across the lappy top as I type.  It hurts.  Not a nice feeling. I was playing my guitar earlier this evening.  I love my guitar.  It's so pretty. I'm always surprised at how popular it is too.  I'll be watching MTV and I'll see a guitar identical to mine in several of the bands.  Then I remember that my guitar is one of those super expensive ones that only professional musicians can afford. I'm not whizz at guitars but I know mine is one of the best.  Epiphone Les Paul Custom Flame Top.  I think those are all the words that describe it.  I'm sure you could buy a used one for $1400 on ebay. har har har.  Yeah, it is pretty much a waste for a totally not guitar player such as myself to own one.  What makes it even more ironic is the fact that I got it free, and my brother (who is a super amazing guitar player) had to pay a shit load of money for a non good guitar.  I got it for free because my dad did some networking for some company that had a partnership with Gibson, so my dad used the credit that the company gave him for doing a good job and got the guitar for me with it.  So I guess it wasn't quite free.  But anyway, I'm done basking in my spoiledness now. Have I ever mentioned that my parents think I'm spoiled?  I have only what the next kid has though.  Okay maybe not.  But I truely deserved the surround sound system for my bedroom...not.  I think my dad was trying to buy my love with it, and the guitar, and the snowmobile, and the atv, and the television, and the stereo system, and the dvd player, and the super amp for my guitar, and my car, and my super cool digi camera, and my own phone line, and my cell phone, andand my laptop, and my printer, and the nintendo 64 (that one was a few years back when they were still the latest thing), an pretty much just about anything I wanted.  Sorry about this whole last couple paragraphs.  I just think that everynow and then I need to appreciate what my dad has done.  Sometimes he and I don't get along. so I have to go back and look at all the stuff that he's wasted his money on for me. My mom doesn't believe in wasting her money though. So all this stuff is from dad.  They're divorced by the way.  Anyway.  I feel like a good kid again.  so I'm gonna end this for now, I might write more later.  Who knows.  Take a picture upside down.  Brie  Post script:  I'll put a picture of my guitar up just for fun.
