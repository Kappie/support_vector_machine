"why do you do the things you do?" "why do you always end up hurting others?" sometimes, you can make a HUGE mistake or you can just screw up [or whatever you wanta call it] in the worst of ways, and sometimes nothing happens. no one gets affected. but then again, in the very rare case of me, no matter what i do, no matter how significant or insignificant, shiet always comes as a result. sure there will be decent results, but along with those, theres ALWAYS that crappy little outcome that just sits there and stares you in the face asking why?? why do i do the things i do? why do i say the things i say? why do i live the life i live? it doesnt help that people jump to conclusions either, but i cant control what people think. assume all you want, ive given up on trying to make you believe what is true. you have the right to think what you want. i could care less. maybe i should just be so completely open with my thoughts and feelings that people would understand exactly what goes on in my mind. maybe i should just disregard the fact that i dont express what im thinking or feeling. or maybe it would be better if i just closed myself off from the world. just sat back and sort of put myself in my own little bubble where no one can affect me and i can affect no one. maybe that would be something good for once... maybe, just maybe, if i can run away from my feelings, my actions, my life. maybe if i can just be free from all this shittiness that has become my life, then i can have a decent life. a life free from pain, a life free from hurt, a life free from doing things and hurting people in the process. a life free from happiness. my happiness. i dont need it. if anything, in order to feel better for all the shit ive ever caused, i think i should just have all happiness taken away from me. heck, why am i writing this? i dont even know. its because of that little nudge in the back of my mind. the little nudge doesnt go away. its letting me know that i made a huge mistake. why do i wreck everything i touch? i dont know. i dont even know whats making me write this huge thing. obviously a part of me wants me to. what the FUCK!!    i want to get away...i wanna fly away
