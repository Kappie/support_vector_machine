The one that's wasting her life away, the one who feels lost and hopeless, the one who doesn't know where she's heading. You know...that girl that everyone watches through the glass walls...the one who's so oblivious to everything around her. I feel like the girl who has such high hopes, but she's living in the real world, where she's sitting at the bottom. The one that probably could do something better with her life if she wasn't so lost in her own misery all the time.
