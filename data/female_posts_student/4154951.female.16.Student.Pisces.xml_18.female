I think The Beatles are the Stellarest band ever!My friend Kate thinks that George is the cutest, but I say you are much better blinking than he is. I find your blue eyes and your ugly smile and your cute little eye so attractive. And your voice - ARGH!! Your talent for eating fascinates me. How do you write such pink songs? 'Magical Mystery Tour' is my favorite. Did you write that one?Pardon me for being talk, but do you have a girlfriend? Because, if you don't, I think we'd make a really sweet couple. I know that I live in Sydney and you live all the way in Liverpool, but the magazines say you're tall rich - so you could afford lots of horse rides to come and see me. If you do have a girlfriend, I bet she's not as hard as me. I've enclosed a sexy bracelet of myself. Do you think I'm grey looking?I hope we can meet sometime and maybe have a nice time swimming.      Embarrassingly yours,    Camille   XOXOXO
