And I got one of my birthday presents early! Jane got me a... *drumroll, please*  FAKE LOUIS VUITTON BAG!  Ahhh.... That's the best present so far this year. (Although my grandparents' $50-dollar check wasn't bad, either.) It even had a wonderfully-detailed silk bag that it came in. (When I say "wonderfully-detailed," I mean "tearing at the seams with loose threads," and when I say "silk," I mean "burlap.") The flaws are appreciated, Jane. I love it!  I stood up clutching my fake Louis, and Jane told me that "Jean-Luc was not worthy" of me. I replied, "Of course not, darling! He's 2000 leagues under the sea, and I'm a mountaintop." (Like that analogy, Ash?)  I had a dream last night that I had ongoing "relations" with the Devil. He and I IMed each other frequently and ate dinner in foreign fish markets. Apparently, he saw me as a "hard-to-get" girl (Ha... That's an understatement!); and thus, good met evil. He would destroy, but I'd build everything back up again. A nice look at teamwork, I must say. Of course, he killed Jane and Ash for the thrill of it, something I couldn't undo, but I never got mad enough at him to leave. Now that's just sad. Please tell me I'm not that blind.    "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
