Mean guy is the old man who is soooo picky. I went to give him his blizzard and he said he wanted me to "level it" and put it in a bag with a spoon and one napkin. Ok leveling ice cream, sure.  ONE  napkin, sure. Then I count back his change to him and he takes it from me, counts it again and says "you're welcome" and left. It was MEAN. Then I got this other old man who smelled and had like a lion mane coming out of his chest, it actually curled over his shirt. But the day was pretty good overall.     I spent about fifteen minutes hoping Lance would come and visit me, then I realized...I'm sweaty, wearing a DQ visor and I'm covered in ice cream and toppings, no I can't say I wanted anyone I know to see me like that.     So I got the schedule for next week and I'm bummed cause I'm not working during the Fourth of July parade, which would have been the only holiday activies I'd of seen. I'm working the night shift that day though. I have the night shift three times next week, which is cool because it goes by really fast.      Moving on...  I have this friend who over uses semi-colons. Here is an example. I like this kid; but he doesn't like me; he's already; got; a;;;;;;;...Drives me up a wall. But I think that I over use... which I know the name of but I can't quite recall. I'm gonna say it starts with an a. Maybe Ap... something. I don't know it's not clicking. All I can think about is Lance, which is bad because I know that our plans rarely work out, which makes me sad, and I know I like him and maybe(hopefully), He likes me too, and maybe like can become something bigger and maybe I can stop day dreaming... Speaking of Dreaming I had the oddest dream last night. And I'm going to tell you all about it. This person, I don't know whether they were a girl or boy, but this person, came up to me and he was wearing a cape. And he was talking, but I couldn't hear him...but I still understood. So what he somehow communicated to me was that we had to fly somewhere. I didn't question the flying, I could just suddenly could do it, and in this dream flying was swimming, but in the sky. So we flew to this huge building. It looked like a Grecian inspired temple, but it was circular and there were gold guilded rungs on a few of the colums. So We both flew into this huge building and there were sparkly things all interconnected by a huge sparkling ruby red string hanging from the very top of the building, which was probably twenty or thirty feet high. I noticed when I looked down while I was flying in one spot near the sparkling objects that there were five or six circles at the bottom of the temple. All of them had a symbol on it and for some reason I understood what they meant, like they were words. So I'm up at the top of this building still, and the man/girl/ person starts giving me directions. And I know whatever it is I was doing was important, I don't know what in specific it was going to, or will lead to, but I knew there was some kind of save-the-world purpose connected. So this person was telling me to grab with my teeth one of the shining objects. They looked as though they were covered in glitter, and they were all odd things like masks and keys and hands...each catergory of items was monotonously one color, I remeber the masks specifically were purple, but everything else is a little blurry. So continuing. I grabbed a mask in my teeth, then swung my foot up to grab something else, it was blue. And each of my hands were on the same object. Soon I was intertwined with all of the sparkling objects. And the person told me to say something, like an incantation maybe, and I said it and all of the objects started to glow. Suddenly I was down on one of the circles at the bottom of the temple. I knew it was the one that said either life or love. A fire lit in a great big pit in the very center of the temple, it was huge, at least twenty feet around and ten feet high. So I stood and I whispered something, from a book I was suddenly holding in my hand, and I was crying a little. Then directly across from me, a circle with either hate or death written on it lowered and this great big black figure rose out of it. I wasn't scared of it but I was angry, really angry with it. And I could see it through the fire and then the dream just ended.  Which bummed me out, it was a cool dream! I'm hoping it will pick up tonight. If anyone is good at dream interpretation out there, feel free to tell me what that means. Well I'm going to go hop in the pool, alone because no one loves me enough to join me.
