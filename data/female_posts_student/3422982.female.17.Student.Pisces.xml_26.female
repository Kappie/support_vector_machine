I really did respect her and look up to her as a role model.  I just like the way she handled her life.  Mom told me Nate misses me.  yeah, I miss my cat too.  Dad took my shopping today for Rachel's b-day presents.  I never went to bed Monday night, holy crap... I felt like shit.  I've been trying to talk Dad into driving me out to Kansas to see Rachel for her birthday.  Have you ever had a secret, and you couldn't tell anyone?!  Yeah I have one and it's eatting away at me.  A few people know, but it's not like they have anyone to tell so I don't care that they know, but the one person I want to tell I can't and it seems her life right now is already shitty, but... I want someone to talk to.  So I don't know if I'll tell her when I see her.  blah...    urlLink        later dayz
