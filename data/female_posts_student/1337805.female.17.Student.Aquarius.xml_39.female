Its sad we live in a world that you can't even walk home from school without being attacked. Right now I just want to hop on my bike and ride to his house, except he lives in another provence, and I'm too lazy to go that far. My thoughts and hugs are with you hun, you know who you are.  Then my so called best friend, who now no longer is, decides, out of nowhere, to tell everyone she knows that I am lesbien. No I am not, its a lie, but she's trying to tell people that I am. I only found out because of a guy I liked asking me if it's true, because he was saddened to find out. Great. I confronted her with it, tell her she's an ass, and I never want to speak with her agian because I'm TIRED of her shit..and she claims it was only a JOKE! And that no one was supposed to take it seriously! Well, come on! You need to assume everyone will take things seriosuly, specially if you tell them in a serious voice telling them, NO JOKE! GRWAH! I'm very angered that I've wasted so much time into this stupid friendship to have her betray me, again, like this. I'm sick of it. Too bad for her, this time I won't listen when she calls me up, crying asking for forgiveness. Too fucking bad. You should have thoguht of that before I "became" a lesbien.  God, I'm tired of this world...I almost have to wonder why I keep on living?
