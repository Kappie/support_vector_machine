I was also very happy I got to see my cousins... although the youngest, Travis, wore me (and his parents) out!  He's so cute, though...  Anyhow, then Friday I spent some more time with family as my Aunt Judy and Uncle Scott came back over to just spend time with my family and Grandma.  We all had a nice dinner, and then my Mom, Kathy (sis-in-law) and I went to go pick up some things for X-mas gifts for my friends.  I needed their input and was thankful for it!  :-)  While we were doing that my aunt and uncle went to Michael's b/c my aunt was helping my uncle buy something for the youngsters...  After we all got back, we snacked on some stuff for supper while watching the A game, and later watched  Finding Nemo .  It's an okay movie, and for some reason it was much funnier watching it with my Uncle Scott.  ;)  Those that know him understand why this is so.  :-)  After watching Finding Nemo, it was around 9pm, so my aunt and uncle each went home.    This morning my Grandma left to go back to Kerrville.  She was both happy and sad.  I was told (by her) not to talk to her about it or she'd cry... which she ended up doing as she and my aunt drove off anyway.  So, it was my family and Rob and Kathy.  We all didn't do a whole lot of stuff... just ate dinner and watched some stuff on TV... had a bit of conversation.  They showed us floorplans for possible houses they'll invest in within the year over in Houston.  I miss those two and wished they lived here in SA.  Oh well... They left around 4pm... and then after that I went over to Ricky's to spend time with the gang before everyone goes their separate ways... We won't see each other again til X-mas break... which is (thankfully) only 3 weeks away.  Anyhow, I'm very tired now and am going to sleep.  I'll post more later... :-)
