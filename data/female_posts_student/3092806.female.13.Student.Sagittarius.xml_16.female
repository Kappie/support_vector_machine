Not to mention I had a Diet Pepsi, orange juice, and a glass of milk. I feel like a pig. It may not sound like a lot but, to me, who hasn't ate this much in one dayfor three months, it's a lot. I've ate from 1800-3000 or 4000 calories today. Ah, if I hadn't fainted or whatever I would kill myself if I had ate this much. Usually, for the past three months at least, I ate under 1600 calories. I didn't even lose all that much weight... I lost about 2.5 pounds since I've seen the school nurse and6 pounds from my last visit with my doctor.  I am so disappointed with myself. I know my body needs the vitamins and other ingredients from the food but I still feel really guilty. I think that from now on I'll just eat like six, very small meals consisting of carrots, apples, and other fruits and vegetables. I'm still not going to eat meat all that much. I might just cut backon the carbs too. Theregoes my favorite food group. I'll miss the breads, cereals, pastas, andthe many others thatI love so dearly... Yes, I think I shall become a vegetarian, again. This time I won't tell my family so they can't blackmail me... I'll turn to the Land of Salads... (No offence to all of the vegetarians out there.) Why not? I mean, it's healthy and it also saves animal's lives... Er, sort of...  Well, I've got to go. I know this is probably my shortest entry ever but I really have nothing left to type down to you. Catch you on the flip side.  I'm outie.
