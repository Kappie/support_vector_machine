Why put on the makeup the heels, the dresses, if this is just an attempt to lure those we want into our circle?  We want love so badly we sell ourselves out to Dolce and Gabbana for a solution.  But what happens when we cut it out.  When we say, enough, here I am take it or leave it....we really mean....take it or leave it, but please, go with the former, don't leave it, here....let me show you how valuable I am.....look, please.        Do we maintain any hope of love unconditionally or have we watched too many Meg Ryan shows to differentiate reality.  Here's the truth.  Love is easy the younger you are.  a.)  You have less past inherently in that you have actually been alive a shorter period.  b.)  You have less hangups, and may still have altruistic beliefs.  c.)  You have less wrinkles, and flab and GOD forbid proof of your lasting existence.  d.)  Less exes accumulated.  e.)  No bills, obligations, kids, jobs, i.e., grownup crap you don't like even when you have to deal with it.    Silly kids in college think their "serious" relationships are the end-all.  No honey, but yes, maybe the end.  Wait til you and your love-of-your-life have a mortgage, and bills, and one of you makes more than the other.  True love, if it exists can transend this.  Flaky "love" cannot inherently because it lacks the requisite endearment and frankly obligation.  My friends would have me tell you that love is not mortgages and bills, but a feeling.  Yeah, its the feeling that will keep your butts together when one gets laid off and the other has to work overtime.  Not the candles, or bubble baths, no sex can do that, its a form of, for lack of a better word, endeared obligation, you love the other enough to keep them afloat.  You throw them the liferaft first.  True love is perseverance, nothing less, the fact you don't quit, you have problems, yes, you have difficulties yes, but you don't want to wake up with anyone else.  You want to call that person first when you bomb a law school final.  You want that person to walk you to your door every night for hereafter, and nobody else.  You know if they screw up, you hope to GOD they call you first so you can try to help them.  You want them to know you love them.  Love is bigger than an ephemeral feeling, the fleeting tingly butterflies are lust or excitement.  Love is less exciting but more so, because it can be counted on.  You don't have to ask if its included, if they want to go, you know they will be there.  You know they will pull the covers over you the weekend before finals and not get pissed because you were running a fever and tossing and turning all night.  They put their arm around you and kiss your forehead the next day, asking if you want some water, if you are okay.               So thats it.  I think I am in love.  I am.  He doesn't know.  After turmoil and being stood up who knows how many times.  He is the one I want to pick me up for dates and wake up to in the morning.  When did this happen and why didn't anybody tell me.  My friends hate him,  because of standing me up, my dad wants a guy who will want me in a stronger less flaky way.  And here I am. In an un-relationship, with the person I want to share my pillow with, who was dating another before, and partially during my reign, and who I have ridiculous stupid quarrels with.  I love him.  I am actually not just saying that.  I really do, oh God what do I do, he doesn't want a relationship and I will be back in Spain on May 25th.  I cannot even imagine a date with another.  How in the fuck did I let it get this far?  I can't tell A. how I feel, not for fear of rejection but for the fact I am sure he will decline.  I took a final today, and I should be happy, right?!  Then at La Fogata, the girls and I hung out and ate and drank, etc., the subject came up about what we were doing tonight, I said I had plans, and another blurted out that I had plans with A.  She said, he begged forgiveness and promised not to be a punk boy.  Another girl at the table said, you know you are not the only one he begged forgiveness from, referring clearly to the girl he was dating before me.  I felt cold and alone and duped and stupid.  I wanted to jump in my margarita glass and drown in the tequila.  I was alone, I am alone, even though I am in love.  That is wrong.  I shouldn't feel this way, I need an out or a way to just get it out there and say it....but what to say...
