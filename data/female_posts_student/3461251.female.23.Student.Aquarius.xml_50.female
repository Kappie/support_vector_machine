It's not like he really knows me or even spends time with me.  Plus, I'm pretty sure if he was to spend a WHOLE day with me - He'd be a bit surprised on how much his little sister as grown up but that would take time out of his schedule, that would also mean he'd have to spend time with someone thats FAT.   What gets me is - People seem to forget, I just had a MAJOR surgery and it does take time to bonuce back to where you were before.  There's no way I could of sat in a car for 12 hours, without getting out other then to get Gas every couple of hours.  Plus on top of that - I can't even eat anything that will be served at BOTH parties!    On the other hand - I thought I'd stay home and stay on program but I keep eating shit.  Which isn't good! :-( And I can't workout because I can't get the damn DVD to work at moms house!  Blah... Someone kick my ass back in to gear! Please?! I can't go into some funky depression mood.  It just can't happen!
