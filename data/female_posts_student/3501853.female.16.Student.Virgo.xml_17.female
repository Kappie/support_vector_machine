I ended up sleeping on the couch last night but somehow I woke up on my bed, thanks mom. I got up and went on-line for a little bit but most of my morning/afternoon consisted of laying down and watching movies. I started bawling while watching Dawson's Creek for like the weirdest reason, I don't even really know why. I was just laying down inhaling the smell of the sweater and then Andie's talking to Jack on Dawson's creek and she said: You can't just leave without letting her know. I mean, that...that's not like you. You just don't just stand and let things happen and you don't run away either. You have to tell her that you love her. And you have to try to get her back. Because if you don't, I promise you, you will regret it. And then tears just came out cuz it's true like as much as I'm trying to pretend I don't care, I do care and I do regret all the bad stuff that has happened. Argh. Anyways then I went and ate lunch, killed the microwave cuz I can't cook or heat things up for shit. Then I went on-line one last time before going to work. I was talking to Art, I was supposed to go chill with him and Dennis at Dennis' house after work but didn't happen cuz ya I didn't call Art cuz Idk y really I didn't want drama between the girls that might have been there plus I just wanted to think. I talked to Lissa too, kool kool. After that I went to work. I guess Kasia thought I wasn't working so both me and Amanda came in and ya it was a big mix-up but I ended up working the night til 8:30. It was an okay night, not too busy. I had to help Alma hide from some stalkers of her. The guys kept smelling my vanilla, after a while I was annoyed but oh well. After work, I went to RecPlexx to work-out. I was on the treadmill for like 25 minutes then the rest of the 35 minutes that I was there I did 25 repeats on these machines: rotator chest, chest press, leg press, shoulder press, abdominal machine. For a while, all the excercising helped me forget about stuff but then I started thinking of how upset she is and how much I want to help her out or just hug her but I screwed up so I can't and thinking of how I screwed up help me excercise even more. Then I looked up to the tv and saw the date..it's the 11th..it would have been 5 months if only I wasn't stupid, I read his away message today and it said ouch, of course my pessimistic mind automatically associates it with a girl and it probably is and that hurts..it's been a month and none of my feelings have changed for either of them, her or him, I still love my friendship with both of them, it's sad to know it's unforgettable and nothing's gone back to normal...well I'm all sore so I'm gonna go..
