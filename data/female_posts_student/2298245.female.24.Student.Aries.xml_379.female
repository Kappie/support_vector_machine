       
      I have not blogged on either one of the brutal beheadings of American citizens that have occurred recently, and I feel the absence of anything about this on my blog is conspicuous, given my feelings and beliefs about world events, so I figured a short explanation might be in order.  There are a couple of reasons:  1. I am very angry about it, and it is hard for me to adequately express my anger and still stay lucid and coherent.  This is doubly true when I am as busy as I have been.  I do not have the time to sit down and focus on the problem to the extent necessary to make my thoughts readable.  I have been working on a post about my anger for months - my general anger, the big anger that has never left me once since 9/11 - and this is unusual for me, since I usually just tap something out quickly and post it.  You're lucky if I run a spell check.  I have not posted it yet, though, because though I have been working on it for a while, I just can never quite get the words right.  Perhaps one day I will be able to present it.  2.  I am going through a down period at the moment - missing my family, fed up and unhappy with school, general summer blah-ness - and I just don't think that I can handle focusing too much on it right now at the moment.  Just thinking about it makes me want to give up on this world completely, with all the things that are wrong with it.  This makes me very selfish I know, but it is the way I have to be to survive.  Perhaps some day I can come back and look at this.  I felt like a heel out enjoying myself with my family this past week, thinking about this man's life hanging in the balance and then hearing that it was abruptly ending.  Life goes on, I know, but it is harder for someone like me, who gets caught up in the little things of life that the big ones often seem unbearable.  Seeing the graphic pictures on Drudge made me burst into tears.  It makes me wonder whether all of this is worth the bother, even though I know it is.  Robert, the Expat Yank,  urlLink sums it up best :   I can't be the only one who REALLY would like to drop an atomic bomb on someone, tonight . . .  Oh, well . . . you know I don't mean that. I know I don't, too. We never mean that.   And that's the difference between us -- and them. That's what makes us better than them. Never forget that.   I have not forgotten, not completely.  Though it does help to be reminded.
