I have had track for the past week. Im really tired. A-Kay. People are really starting to get on my last neve. I mean, people that I thought were my best friends, are randomly starting to hide things from me. What ever happened to telling people things. Not just any people or person, your friend. I mean, you guys know me. Im a layed back person. Im not one to over react about anything..well almost anything. I don't understand you people anymore.  I take that back. I don't understand you.  Yeah, you thought it was bad right? >Wrong. Bad only justifys the skin of things. If you want to save me, I'll be endebted to you forever.
