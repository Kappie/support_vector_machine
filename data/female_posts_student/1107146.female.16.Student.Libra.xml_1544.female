Hey Abby, my phone's being gay, it's a bit storm-shy. Like always, right? O well...have fun at that place...thingy where the Mexicans are going to take me.  I dun have the car. I'm at my dad's making sure nothing decides to detonate and to keep the cats alive and stuff.   I never knew how much I drink until I came here, and there's nothing. All of the  caffeine-free and diet  Pepsis are gone, in like...two days. Not that there were many...of course I never mass-consume caffeinated beverages. And now working on some white cranberry raspberry something-or-other Brand X thing, and as soon as that's gone, I've got coffee, and I've got uno non-alcoholic beer, and they taste horrible so I probly won't be consuming that...yes, I know everyone is freaking out because I used the word " beer "...and water, god forbid. This is Nashville. Water here is basically sewage run thru a chlorine filter.  But that's enough about me, how about the rest of you?
