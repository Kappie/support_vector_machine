No, I shouldn't give a reason for you to stay. I guess I'm very quiet lately. I like to attribute it to AP week and concentration on studies, but deep down I'm not so sure. I shouldn't have started it again. Leave it to me to screw things up, I'm a natural.  I'm glad I only have to feel this disoriented once a day. It's terrible. I'm invariably disturbed from slumber over dinner concerns. I'm still not awake by the time I sit down at the table; Mom often asks me if I'm daydreaming. I still have many pages in Cliff's to go, to start with.  And logically, the next track starts running in my head too: "I've got a hunger/twisting my stomach into knots."  I still have to write a column. I was thinking on taking the concept of love and turning it into something, but it won't work: I've already started out too phony. I looked up the words to "Love Changes Everything" and a slightly unshaven Greg on the next computer (playing Mario, no less) wouldn't convince himself that no, I wasn't writing a love poem to him. Columns have to go somewhere, I tell myself. This love idea is going to sound way too nostalgic for someone who isn't even graduating this year, but I'll miss my seniors. Oh man. Journalism is going to be abysmal without them. I'm trying not to count down the days. I'll miss Pegleg and Keira and Brandon the most, but the others are awesome too. Pegleg promises to come back and help us out.  Off to study. To finish talking to Ellis and Steve and then off to study, hah.
