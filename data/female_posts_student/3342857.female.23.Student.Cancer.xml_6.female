Recently, she came back buying FCUK clothes for me and TY...she's just another girl who will put friends above her....thanks gal!! Oh....and i got to say that Su got endless numbers of admirers....guys just get attracted to her...no doubt, she's pretty...while TY is kinda settled down with her fiancee...me is still searching for the one....wonder when only it'll appear...but i am too lazy to go out and socialise. Now that i got myself a research, with USMLE next year and endless number of exams....i don't even have enough time for myself...
