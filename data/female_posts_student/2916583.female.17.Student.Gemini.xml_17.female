For some reason he's been coming over and using our phone...I think his service is down. Yummy in my tummy!  I just had grilled cheese and soup.  Mmm mmm good!  That Charlie's Angels movie's tonight.  I think I'll watch it...that one about Three's Company is pretty good.   Well I'm playin checkers again, and it's definitely only late at night that I win.  She or he has outnumbered me seven to three.  Ouch.  Yeah, I just lost.   Hey, have you seen those muzzy commercials, and the girl says jes sui lajum vi (I know that's grossly misspelled, but I took three years of Spanish, not French).  Anyway, I learned that it means I am a little girl.  Yay! I love this song...it's one of a handful of Britney Spears songs I actually like.  I dunno, that song  Toxic  just makes u want to dance.  I'm also into that Linkin Park  Numb , Jessica Simpson  With You , Usher  Yeah  (another song that makes me want to shake, Sheryl Crow The First Cut Is The Deepest  , Outkast  Hey Ya , this song called One Thing that goes If I traded it all/If I gave it all away for one thing/Wouldn't that be something?  It's really annoying cause I love the song.  Also, Five For Fighting  100 Years , Limp Bizkit  Behind Blue Eyes , and Maroon 5's  This Love .  I have very odd tastes, don't I?  Lots of pop, some alternative, a tiny bit of R  B.  I wish I still had Kazaa (I took it off the computer in lieu of all those lawsuits) so I could download them.  If I drank a LOT of Pepsi, I could do it (lol it would cost me like $30). LOL!!!  I wonder if my chem class reads this, cause I'm listening to  Milkshake  by Kellis.  Elizabeth, Katy, Mallory and Emily had to tell me that "milkshake" is not a milk and ice cream treat u get at McDonalds!  It's kind of gross, actually.  How can u teach someone to make their "milkshake" (lol) to be better?  Well if watermelons (haha Emily!) make guys' "ice cream" better, I suppose eating strawberries or something might help.  But I'll have to charge for that tip lol. Enough gross talk.  Yummy...Troy's opening May 14.  Maybe I can do that for my birthday...go to CiCi's and then to watch Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and sum other hott guys in a history flick...sounds like the ultimate birthday!  Maybe I can have a sleepover!   Well I have to take a bath.  Later. By the way...for all u haters on santa, u can't say he doesn't exist!!!  Look at this!
