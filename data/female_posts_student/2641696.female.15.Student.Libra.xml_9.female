It's awesome :) So I'm pleased to announce that  urlLink :: genius ::  (as it's now called) is completely rennovated and beautiful! Even if it only was created    what, two, three days ago?   No matter. As I was saying, that's all I have time for, and I probably won't be doing too much posting tomorrow either, due to lots of homework and a piano lesson. Ciao :)
