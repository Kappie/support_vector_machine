And when they are sleeping I can usually get online and talked to audrey, cac, danny, ally, and steve-o! so thats alright... Today I found who for sure is gonna be on my 3v3 soccer team..Gab, Liz, Molly, and myslef. I think we have a pretty good chance of doing well in the tournament. (im keeping my fingers crossed.)because the last tournament well, we didnt do so hot. Well i got to go get ready for work ;)
