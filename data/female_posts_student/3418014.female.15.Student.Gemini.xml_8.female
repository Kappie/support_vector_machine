Something that is wanted is not necessary for life. It would be nice to have everything that we want but then we would all be spoiled brats. Wanting, without recieving itself can poison the mind. We focus on the items we wish to have, the people we wish to know, and ocmpletely ignore all the important things that we already have. It is human nature to think about bigger better everything rather than enjoy what wehave. This whole concept has a path leading right to greed. If you got what you want all the time, your mind will be tricked into thinking what you want is what you need. Think about it: you start with a brand new cell phone in 1993, your one of the only people who has one. The cell phone is about the size of your hand, with a blip open mouth piece and antenae which make the phone more than twice as big. You don't care because that is the standard size cell phones come in. Years go by, technology is advancing faster than ever. Your cell phone changes with each advancement. Now it's 2003, your cell hpone is no longer twice the size of your hand, but the length of your index finger. It hass all the new capabilities, such as mini games and a million different rings to choose from. Asd well as accessing your emial account and checking the weather forecasts. Now, for some reason, you can no longer have your high-tech minicell and need to go back to your old, huge cell phone. How do you feel? Your old cell phone no longer holds the pride it once did, it doesn't fele good anymoer to hold the phone you once loved. You desire your other cell phone, the tiny high-tech one.       This is what wanting can lead you to. The constant lust for the better luxuries.  Needing is a lot healthier than wanting....  I never finished it, I know what I was going to say though, needing is living in the real world, goals instead of dreams, you only get what you need, and what is wanted is forgotten. When you need, there is substantial reason, not just the bigger. Advancements are because they are necessary, not because you are lazy, yes, as a society we might not have industrialized as much, but we would be purer.
