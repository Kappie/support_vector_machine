I got a new swimming suit in the mail today, tried it on and of course was not too happy about the way it looked.  Its like I feel like I have been trying really hard to get in shape, but its just not coming along as fast as I’d hope.  Its working, all my walking, swimming, better and what not… but still.  *Sigh*  Cripe its not like how I look REALLY matters, but still.  At least I KNOW I am getting stronger and have much more stamina, so that’s good.  Tomorrow I am getting up at five to walk/jog early, and I’ll start my health log.  Please Camille, please don’t push snooze and go back to bed, get up!  Eh, that was interesting.  Anyways, then we went to C.R. this afternoon.  The kids were wretched, absolutely horrible.  They fought about everything.  Then Mom and Laura started in on it, geeze, Laura really doesn’t know when to shut up sometimes, she makes me so freaking angry.  We were all crammed in the minivan, we went shopping at Target so we had all that junk, and the kids say they are hungry.  So of COURSE they can’t pick ONE place to eat at right?  NO!  That would be too easy.  So we’re driving trough like 20 places, and then driving through again because someone forgot to get this or that….MAN!  Our house is half an hour away, but we HAVE to drive through to get our STUPID food because its SO much easier.  GAAAHHHHHHH!  If I have ever had a migraine it was today!  Bah on life and this infernal family!
