We ended up at the Dairy Queen but hey, it was the only place not busy in December (I wonder why!) :-)  Perhaps things are going to settle down now.  I can't imagine that much else could go wrong this week.    Christmas is coming so quickly.  Hard to believe that one week from now, it will all be over for another year.  More to come...
