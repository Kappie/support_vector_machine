College was fun today. I recorded it. It's surprising how different people act when they see they are being recorded... Well Len sent me this beautiful song, so I'm gonna publish the lyrics. I've got nothing else to say apart from just taken end of year ten exams, not doing too well.  So until next time...keeps these lyrics with you   I hurt myself today  To see if I still feel  I focus on the pain  The only thing that's real  The needle tears a hold  The old familiar sting  Try to kill it all away  But I remember everything   What have I become  My sweetest friend  Everyone I know goes away  In the end  And you could have it all  My empire of dirt  I will let you down  I will make you hurt   I wear this crown of thorns  Upon my liar's chair  Full of broken thoughts  I cannot repair  Beneath the stains of time  The feelings disappear  You are someone else  I am still right here   What have I become  My ssweetest friend  Everyone I know goes away  In the end  And you could have it all  My empire of dirt  I will let you down  I will make you hurt   If I could start again  A million miles away  I would keep myself  I would find a way   Toodlepip hunnies xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
