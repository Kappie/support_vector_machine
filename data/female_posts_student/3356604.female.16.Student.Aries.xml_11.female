When I'm on holidays, it's as though my whole sense of time just evaporates. Anyway, Saturday I went to the movies again...and now, I am so sick of going to the movies I can't even begin to explain. I saw Mean Girls with my sister, and that was alright. Pretty funny with good morals. Uh, we spent way to long at an airport, to meet up with a Canadian woman who used to live locally and was friends with my mum. I wasn't too happy, considering I was pissed off at my sister already and the first thing the woman said to me was how much me and my sister look alike. Ugh. Then my sister flew to Adelaide to watch our cousin, so that at least gives us a bit of a break. She seems to find it amusing to pretend to be hurt or in trouble, and then laugh uproarously when I try to help her out. As anyone who knows me can imagine, I find this less than amusing. Perhaps for Christmas I should buy her a copy of "the Boy Who Cried Wolf? Sunday I stayed at my Grandma's, and considering I was feeling a bit crook, spent most of that time in bed asleep. Yesterday I went to a party down my road a bit with Adam, and that was OK. I spent most of my time holding people's heads while they threw up...but hey, the price I pay for not drinking myself hey? One girl I helped is my friend, so that's ok...but this other girl was someone I had never met and she was sick as a dog, so to speak. Heh, she kept asking me to let her sleep...but I decided that if she fell asleep we might have some difficulty waking her up. Oh well, I guess at least I got to spend SOME time with Adam, and catch up with Heather, whose party it was. I really am hopeless at keeping in touch with old friends. Anyway, must dash. Ciao
