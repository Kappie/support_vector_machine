I guess ive been thinking a lot lately and not about what clothes i wanna buy, not all that materialistic stuff, but more of a spiritual side. Its like things used 2 be when hannah, lewis and i were really close, we used have amazing conversations at times about the one thing we had in common that no body else shared with us. I guess ive been missing the past lately. Neway back 2 my thinking, i feel ive reached a plateau (i think thats how u spell it). Ive realised sumthing that i have been so blind to see and i believe i have grown a bit. If mum hadnt of been on the computer all day yesterday i would have written a blog about my thoughts, but sum of those thoughts were scary. Yesterday i realised that even though my tenison "friends" r not wanting nething 2 do wit me (or at least most of them), which is kinda lonely, i prefer it 2 having 2 go 2 skool and watch them ignore me and hear there bitchy lil comments evry so often.   I feel so alone in this world, sumtimes i sit in my room b4 i go 2 bed and hope that ill go 2 sleep and neva wake up. I dont think id eva be able 2 say this stuff 2 ppl but i feel like im writing in my diary, when i write my blogs. I wish i didnt live here, i wish that i could b sumwhere else and b sum1 else but i cant. I feel trapped in this life that lays b4 me. my mum wants me 2 be a lawyer and she wants me 2 dance, and im afraid that i cant live up 2 her expectations. Im afraid i wont live up 2 ne1s expectations. I dont wanna be a lawyer but i do wanna dance but i dont want  it 2 take ova my life. I need balance. Im always searching 4 balance but i neva have it. I love my dancing and im meant 2 be talented but i know im not talented enough, so many competition judges r corrupt, it makes me wonder whether i will eva reach my dream. I want it so bad.  I feel an empitiness in my heart and soul and i feel it grow larger as evry day passes by, i want 2 fill it but i dont know wat with. im so lost and i have been 4 a while now. I fill my life with fake happiness 2 hide wat i really feel, i spend my money on materialistic things 2 try and boost my confidence that drops constently. I get told that im pretty but i dont believe it, i supposedly get checked out by guys all the time. They must be blind. No matter wat im told i hate myself and i hate this town and sum of the ppl and i hate my life. I just wish it would all go away but it neva will. I want it 2 end but it wont. I want ppl who i have lost faith in 2 prove 2 me that they care but they cant bcoz they dont know im hurting so much inside. nobody knows except the ppl who i let read this. I regret writing it all, but sum1 has 2 know. I have been crying out silently 4 help 4 so long but i neva receive it. the only way i deal with it is 2 put on that mask, the happy mask, so that i give evry1 evry day another opportunity and most days i am again left dissapointed and i dont know how long i can keep it together. But enough of this, i should stop, ive already said more than i eva wanted 2 reveal but it is already done. Until my next blog...
