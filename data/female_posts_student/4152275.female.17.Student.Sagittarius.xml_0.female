Okay so i meant to update this a loooonnnnggg time ago, but i keep forgetting.. or when i remeber I manage to not have anything to write about... so i have a couple things on my mind tonight.. lets begin.  So Market Mall opening is new expansion on August 11th. Ever since that dreaded day... our store has been non-stop busy.. its insane.. we're pulling in like $1300 a day.. and this time last year it was only around $800.. bah, so work has been awful, bottom line.  Wow, there almost only 2 weeks left before school, im scared... terrified really.. eep..  So a random impulse hit me yesterday while i was at work.. now we all now my last random impulse failed because the place was closed [who closes on a Wednesday?? like really!] .. but no, so i needed something to do on my break.. and so i randomly got the impulse to go pierce another part of my ear.. yeah didn't think it through or anything.. i just went... so $25 bucks later.. i now have a hole in the top part of my ear!!! yay! i've been waiting so long to do so. muhahahaha  Hmmm.. not really anything else new. I got to see the Butterfly Affect [do you realize it has 2 endings!], and I also go to see Robin Williams on Live Broadway.. omg, that man is hilarious. If you ever wanna win me over, go watch stand-up comedy with me.. thats one thing i could watch for hours and never get bored.. i absolutely adore it.  ah, so my friend Sam from Edmonton convinced me to get a nexopia page. if you ever wanna see it *as soon as i get it up and running of course* my user name is chellbee         arg, so being home is *fun* .. i think as soon as i turn 18 im gonna be a "party animal" and go out and party all night.. i mean that would be good. work, school and party... only come home to sleep.. hmmmmmmm what a contemplation  *sigh*  je veux m'endormir pour que je me r√©veille jamais  ah somedays, like today.. i think that would be nice... eternal rest.. no more reality for me. hmm *sigh* ....... ... . ah well, thats enough for tonight.  -Chellbee  -------------------
