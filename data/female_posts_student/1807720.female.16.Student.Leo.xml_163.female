Bio was alright but at first I thought this handout thing that we got was like really hard.  I guess maybe I shouldn't assume so much, because once I tried the stuff and had a better attitude about it, it seemed to be a lot easier.  At lunch Ash and Chels just talked about stupid work ignoring the fact that I don't know the people they work with.  So basically I sat there for a very long time not saying a word.  Oh what a great lunch!  NOT!  Anyways English was nice cause we switched to novel study and now I have Proux (I think that's how to spell it) and like today was so nice for English cause he actually taught!  Unlike the classes I had before with Schamber.  In Active Living we played boring basketball.  I seriously should of signed up for rugby, should-of, could-of, but didn't.  So I will just have to deal with a sport I done like for a while, that I can deal with.    I keep hearing all about chem 30.  It's starting to freak me out.  I was talking to Thy and she told me she is going to drop Chem 30 cause she got 35% on the unit test.  Reminder:  Thy had a higher average than me in Chem 20.  Ok so thinking about that....I'M SCARED.  It doesn't matter if I don't have Chem 30 now, cause next year I will.  So yeah I have heard LOTS of stories about chem.  I suppose I should worry about what I have to deal with now actually.  I'm going to review my Bio some more tonight.  I am very determined to do good.
