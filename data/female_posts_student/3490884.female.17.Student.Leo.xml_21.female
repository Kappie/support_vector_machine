I guess I have something interesting enough to say, and if not, then, discontinue reading right about now.       So I've hung out with some cool people, had a sleepover, saw some movies, ate some dinners. Fun times. Unfortunately, however, I haven't done enough of my summer work as in reading and writing essays and my math work. I haven't looked into college applications and early applications like I should have, but I have had a blast this summer. One thing that's certain is that I will never forget Summer '04--the people I met, the things I did, and my overall experiences.     So I guess I'll get to that work, but it's so hard when just about every moment has been planned out for me prior to my realizing I had a ton of work that needed to be done over this summer too.  For now, I'll have to deal with it later.       What else? Well, people have already brought up Senior Prom. I just said wow...school has not even started yet. I don't want to even think about that right now, and I doubt I'll want to think about it when it comes up.        I've been thinking a little lately though. This is going to sound absolutely horrible, but my major question is--when you look around at people, and they're just average, as in they're smart, they're nice, they're pretty, they're sweet--why is it that these people seem to find romance so easily? It's not as if they're much prettier, smarter, more interesting, or more popular than you are, but they find romance without all the restrictions and obstacles you do. They find romance all the time, and they're never single for more than a week or two. This is going to sound selfish and mean, but it's not as if they're better than you in any way that you can see. They're your friends and all, but they're not that amazing. Yet, they have relationships galore as if they're especially great--and they're just not.       That sounds bad, but it's what I've been thinking about.  I definitely don't consider myself stupid, unpopular, ugly, or lacking in talent--so why is it that I have so many issues with the opposite sex? I'm about to be seventeen, and let's just say that aside from this summer, my romantic life has been, well-- sad.       So, I'm sorry, but what the hell? Do guys honestly want a bimbo without an opinion?       If that's what they want, I'll be single for life. I'm sorry, but I"ll never give them that, and I'll never change. So is it that I'm intimidating? Is it that I don't give guys a chance, as has been previously suggested? Is it that I'm  repulsive in some way? Or...is it that I scare guys with my "air of confidence and security" like some have proposed?       All of these questions lead to simply more questions, so basically, what am I supposed to do? People asked me about which guys I like or could even see myself developping feelings for in our school, and sadly, I couldn't think of one "acceptable" guy--maybe one or two, but still. That's sad. Am I that picky? I don't mean to be that picky, but I won't settle for someone dumb or disinterested or uninterested in academics. I won't settle for someone without anything he excels in besides schoolwork either--well no, I just won't settle for a completely boring, unintelligent guy. He has to be sweet and a great listener. He has to be understanding and helpful and just nice in general. I just refuse to settle, because I know what I deserve.       And I know guys like this must exist. I met a few this summer, but why is it that North Brunswick has none? Is it something in the water? Why are there so few that I seem to know even across the country? Is that the rare type or is it that I just don't see it in people? Maybe I'm too picky, but maybe not. Who knows? Not me...that's the problem.      Well, I guess I"m done. But I'm not satisfied. I just wanted to get some thoughts out, but this hasn't helped much. Maybe I won't even publish this. I don't know.       Where is my match? Isn't everyone supposed to find, if not his or her match--someone he or she can relate to in a romantic way--during adolescence usually in school?       For now, I say...I guess not.
