We had a talk this week about how he wants to date me and other people (oh, and lucky me, I could do the same, too!), and I think he already had someone in mind. Some potbellied black bitch who didn't look too into him when they were dancing, anyway. But he got her number last week at the club, and he danced with her all night last night at the club (yeah, even with me there, he made no attempts to dance with me), and then he took her home. So that's the end of us. I know it didn't last very long, but I can't help being upset because we had a friendship and not just a romantic relationship. I thought he had more respect for me than to just fucking hook up with someone like that. He was the one who said he'd be honest if that's what he chose to do. Guess there was no time for honesty last night! I am going to miss him in my life. I told him I hated him, that he was a slut, and I never wanted to talk to him again. I mean it, too. I fucking don't have anything to say. I could ask him if she was good, I guess, but I don't care, actually. I hate him. I can't believe these shitty things keep happening to me over and over. I don't know anyone whose dating life is as fucking tumultuous and as AWFUL as mine! I know every girl thinks her dating life is bad and guys are the devil, but geez...get a load of mine. It's so over, I'm so bummed out. He always said he hoped things went somewhere between the two of us...yeah, they went into the gutter! I can't think about this much more. I am running the maybes over and over in my head, and that's not good. He didn't want just me, and none of my actions could've stopped what he did and nothing I did would make him 100% satisfied. I know it's not me, it's him and his fucking gigolo attitude. Ah, but you know, all of the good reasons still don't cure the hurt.
