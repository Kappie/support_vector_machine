From the day i learn the phrase " green with envy", I have been thinking why isn't it "red with envy" but "red with anger" so on and so forth. Can we really see a green colour on a person if the person is jealous? If this really happen, everyone on this earth will be green...i mean, definitely everyone or most of us is once jealous of something right? How about the green man on the traffic light? Does it mean that the green man is jealous of the red man above him because the red man can make people stop? Haha...maybe i should stop all my craps le.          Anyway, i hate the feeling of jealousy. It will only make me feel unhappy, unsure of myself, lack of confidence, sadness, revengeful and many many more.           Is it possible if jealousy is not one of the feelings we felt every now and then?
