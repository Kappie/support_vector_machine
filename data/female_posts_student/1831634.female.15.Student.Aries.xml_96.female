Geog Roelofs (god save me)   Precal Fischer (dreading it)  Art Garrison (had this teacher in fifth grade... remember Mrs. Lynch, Yini?)  W Hist Forgot (can't believe I don't know who my teacher is)  English Kean (never have, do, or will like english)   JOY! -___-   Blogger says I've blogged a total of36 thousand something words on this blog. That's some interesting stuff there. It also says I have 94 posts on this blog. That's less than one thousand words per post. That's not even a picture per post. (hahaha funny joke, eh? okay I guess not.)   So my NEW GOAL is...   at least one thousand words per post!   And how will I know when I've reached one thousand words?   Why, Microsoft Word, of course! Hahaha.   ...so far, am only at 100-something words.   Okay, perhaps I change my mind. One thousand words is obviously biting off way more than I can chew right now. Maybe once school starts and I can fill this thing up with gossip.   ...HA! Like anyone gossips to me.   Anyway. In other news.   I was talking with Jackie today during Driver's Ed, and I was like, "Jackie, the girl sitting right beside me is blatantly cheating!"   And I know because during the final exam, half her answers were blank (yes, that means I looked, but I was done and I was freaking bored). PLUS, she can't even freaking spell! She spelled "shoes" as "shose", and "execute" as "xcute". I was like, that doesn't even work out phonetically! And somehow she got a 106. PSH. Please.   Anyway. Digressing. So then Jackie was like, "So? Everyone cheats."   So of cooouuurse... I asked her about the top ten at Jasper!   "Jackie," I started off, "do you think the top ten at Jasper cheats?"   And she replied (quite belligerently, too... even though I don't know what that word means. Take what it means by its sound, not by its meaning, if that makes sense.), "Why of course they cheat! Well, not Kailing, because she's just too good for that, but everyone else."   Then I just sat there blinking at her, and she was blinking at me, and then she said, "Oh! You're in the top ten, aren't you?!" And I was thinking, "Hmm."   Speaking of which, I was supposed to meet her on mIRC. oops.   And then she told me that Erin Yu cheated by changing her scantron (as in after the teachers handed the scantrons back, she changed her answers and told the teacher the scantron misread it). I never even knew you could do that. I mean, I've never even THOUGHT about doing that. (Yes, I've thought about cheating, but then I figured, "No way I could do it. I have a horrible poker face." Hahaha just joking. -___-)   Now. About my day.  I woke up at 11.30 in a panic because I was supposed to go watch Ella Enchanted with Jackie at 12! So I got up and checked my caller ID, but she hadn't called. So I was like, "Whew!" But then 1010 called, and she told me to call Ning for her, so my phone line was tied up for like half an hour. By then it was neeeaaarly 12, but not quite. So then someone rings my doorbell! I wasn't dressed yet!  So I hurry up and throw on whatever I could reach and went to answer the door. My lazy brother was in the master bedroom watching TV, fully dressed and awake since 9. Geez.  And lo and behold, it was Jackie! And she was like, "Wanna go watch Ella Enchanted, Sunny?" And I was in a panic, calling my mom (thankfully she let me go) and getting money. So I went in my raggedy clothes and unkempt hair and all.  We were supposed to watch Ella Enchanted, but it was 12.15 by the time we got there and there was a HUGE line, and the tickets were sold out, so we were just like what the heck, let's watch Mean Girls. So that's what we did.  I'd already watched it before (on the last day of school with Kailing!), so I just watched the purses of everyone throughout the entire movie. Regina George and Cady both have Louis Vuitton purses. Regina's is the pattern with the cherry blossoms on them, while Cady's is just the colorful one. They're both the same style, too. Ridiculously expensive ($475 w/o tax) and ridiculously small (8in x 5in x 1in, if that). Anyway.  And then after the movie was done, I realized that all the KDers would be there. And lo and behold, I saw Jack Wang as I was walking out. I was like =OO Jackie, stay in here with me! And she was like, "Why? It's just Jack." And I was like, "Nooooooo..." So finally we exited the thatre through the back and had to wait in the little alleyway until Jack went away. Jackie was keeping watch for me. There were lots of insects back there. But still better than a confrontation with Jack Wang.  So then Jackie tried calling Jason to come pick us up, but he wouldn't pick up the phone! Turns out he was asleep... So finally we walked to Mei Hua and waited for Jackie's mom to pick us up. The movie was over at 2.20; Jackie's mom came for us at 3. Now I want to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Anyone want to accompany me?  Then just muddled around, chatted, played neopets, until driving, and now I'm here.  Btw, GO KERRY. An okay speech, not the best, but an COLLOSAL mistake in the middle. It was supposed to be "anti-terrorist" (something about building up resistance to terrorists, and stuff like that), and he said "terrorist". -___-  Off to read Bourne Identity now. =D  Toodles.  Word count: 1000.
