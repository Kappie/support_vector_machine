I have spoken to people at Nextel, and the dirtbag is blocked from calling me.  All of his numbers (which unfortunately cuts me off from his sister, who is one of my friends).    Anyhow, I want to say THANK YOU SO MUCH to  urlLink The Boyf  for calling me up last night to tell me silly jokes and make me laugh and remind me of how awesome he is and that I don't need to worry myself about all this crap.  So, yay.  This morning the power was out at  urlLink my job  for 2 hours.  Rather than sending us home, they mayoral figure and A-Number-One Douchebag, decided to keep us here "just in case".  Unfortunately the power came back on, but it was fun to not do anything for a few hours.  Everyone just sat around and acutally got to talk to each other and it was nice to get along.  We all chipped in money and Pat got sent on a  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts Run  to get some coffee and for everyone.  It was fun to have an impromptu mini party.  I haven't acutally done any REAL work yet this A.M. though as I've been doing work on my Western Civ presentation on the "Carolignian Renaissance" and getting some stuff together that I have to mail at lunchtime from  urlLink ebaY  sales I've made.    So in conclusion, I just wanted to let you all know that I'm feeling much more cheery and back to my usual Gwennish self.  I also wanted to share a joke with you that I love love love...  Q:  Why did the cookie go to the hospital?  A:  Because he felt  CRUMMY   Get it?? Get it?? ::rimshot::  Don't forget to tip your waitress, you've been a great crowd.
