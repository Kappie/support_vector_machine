(blah, ugh, yuck, puke!!!!!)  he's taking a bus up here from milwaukee, then leaving from the airport with AIR FORCE ONE....dun dun dun....i work that day, so at least i'll get to see the plane.  the secret service is scheduled to be here on monday.  they're probably going to shoot me come wednesday...i'm not going to be able to keep my mouth shut...i'll be yelling and cursing bush all morning.    N: SICK BABY is getting ready to take off.  rounding the runway.  ok, i lost sight of em.  oh, well.  yeah, this is the stupidest entry in the world, i'm just going to do myself a favor and shut the eff up. lata matsen
