This happens a lot in my e-mail program and I know I should copy and paste before I hit a button like "send" or "publish post."  Now I am torn.  Should I attempt to re-create it? Or should I move on?  Since it is now 11pm and I have to get up very early. I am tempted to move on.  But if I don't write it now it will become obsolete and therefore unpostable.  Sigh.  So this week is Trial Advocacy Week here at The Firm.  We get to pretend  like we are real lawyers trying a real case before a real judge and  real jury.  It's terrifying because even though it is all make-believe  it's actually pretty darn close to what trial lawyers actually do.  The firm even hired people from a temp agency to listen to our mock  trial.  They have been told that we are real lawyers doing a mock run-  through of a real trial.  I had to give my opening speech in a practice  session and I about passed out.  It turns out I have stage fright so  guess I'll never be a rock star.     Did I mention that The Firm rented the rose bowl and threw a big party  there on last saturday (the night of the fuck to forget hook-up, which actually didn't involve any fuck)?  Well, if I didn't mention it, I am now.  The Firm rented out the rose fucking bowl.  You know where they play football?  Like the big, expensive stadium in pasedena?  They rented out the whole thing, brought in a few carnival rides (mostly the lame ones that only require you to fill them with air, but still!)  They had  tons of food, copious amounts of alcohol and a live (cover) band.  The  band, was too be expected, not great, but they played mostly classic  rock, which was fun.  At one point I yelled out "Play some AC/DC!" I  didn't think they heard me, but a few songs later they plaid "you shook  me all night long."  So that was kind of cool. kind of, because they  butchered the lyrics.  kind of, because I couldn't help but dance.    kind of, because when I was dancing there were only four other people  on the floor (two other summers and two lawyers).  kind of, because it  was really creepy to see the lawyers dance to ac/dc, especially to a  song with lyrics such as   she was a sex machine, she kept her motor clean; and  she told me to come, but i was already there.   Anywho. So last night (monday) I went out with another guy.  And this time I broke the only really important rule I had:  DON'T DATE SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH.   Well, I kind of broke it.  Because even though this guy, MR. Jack, works at my firm I don't actually work  with  him.  So it's not so bad.  Except that is.  Why? Because he is the nephew of a named partner.  For those of you not familiar the named partners are the top of the food change.  They're the lawyers with their names in the firm's name.    So Mr. Jack and I went out to see a rock show at the Whiskey A-go-go.  And I kissed him.  Actually, I was really surprised.  I think I actually like him.  I wasn't sure if I did at first.  Well that's not true.  I knew I liked him, but I wasn't sure I was attracted to him.  But I think i am.  I am certainly really comfortable around him.  After the show we went to a bar and shot pool and then we laid on the beach for an hour.  I guess it was a little cheesy.  But it was my idea and he didn't make fun of me for the cheesiness.  And it was nice.  Yes, I think I like Mr. Jack.    None of this was anything I wrote about in the lost post, which was titled "small loss."  The big loss was losing that post, because I am too fucking tired to re-create it now.    I will say this:  1) saw jack tonight 2) shahin called, didn't answer the phone 3) david called.  David is lonely and bored and he says he misses hanging out with me.  I admit that hearing his voice made me love him all over again.  But he is so confusing.  Am too tired to talk about it.  He says he plans on NOT sleeping with Shaina, shahana shana (whatever her name is).  I say, even if you don't plan on it happening, it might.  I don't know.  I miss him.    okAY. sleep is needed. This time I copy the text before attempting to publish
