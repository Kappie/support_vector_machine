Nothings wrong wiuth going.. well the only thing wrong is if Addas mom/dad will let me.I can ask my mom for money for the presents and i can take the bus! Wow.. Im so mad and sad right now.Denny is still as grumpy as she is with me even though i didnt do anything and shes anoyying me more then i anoy her.Yep.. things are just going great...    EDITED-  Me and Denny are STARTING to get along =P
