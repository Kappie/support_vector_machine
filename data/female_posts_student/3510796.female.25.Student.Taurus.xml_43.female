She told me that her agreement was exclusively with my roommate, and that as far as she was concerned, I was staying here under his invitation, as a way to split the costs.  And so, I've lost.  By September 18th, I will need to find a new job, a new home, and new stuff.  But, this too shall pass.  And I'll probably be better off for the experience in the end.  I'm not going to fight, because there's no reason.  I'm not going to be vengeful or bitter toward my roommate, either, because that would accomplish nothing other than making this whole experience even more difficult for me.  However, I think Grey's idea of having a blowout "Fuck You" party right before I leave is a grand one.  Yeah, that'll have to happen.  Matt must be feeling at least a slight twinge of guilt about the situation.  He took me out for dinner tonight at Applebee's.  Word of advice: stay away from the riblets.  Not boneless.  Tasty, but a pain in the ass to eat.  Might as well just go for the ribs.  Tonight is Erica's last night at work.  And we're all making sure she goes out in style.  A big drinking night and dancing at the worst club ever until 4 in the morning looms in the near future.  It's gonna be some good times.
