Or when people think they have to be skanks/"cool"/the same as everyone else to fit in. The world would be such a happier and more interesting place if everyone started acting like themselves, dressing like themselves and not trying to be exactly like the model in that random magazine.  Why is it that people have that strange urgeto be like everyone else? Well, people want to be accepted, they want to have friends.. no matter what they try to tell people. In an attempt to do this, some people go too far and give up even their own personalities in order to be "happy".  Ive been there. Its not a fun place to be. You hate yourself for not being who you are, and its like you live in constant fear of being found out. Its draining, frustrating and annoying, and I gave up, thanks to my laziness.. its been the best thing that could ever happen to me.  So the moral of this story? Well its just easier to be yourself in the long run. And its better too. So wipe the cum off your face, get off your knees, and wear something respectable. Thank you.    Today I restrung my electric guitar. And played it.. its been a while. I havent used it sincethe band broke up.. I miss it. Not just the guitar but the band. Especially the band. I think we were supposed to jam sometime this week.. thatd be really nice. The biggest problem was that we started things too seriously. We didnt play for the music anymore.. we just played because.. why did we play? for gigs? just to say we were in a band?I dont know. Whatever the case was, it wasnt fun anymore. Maybe we've all grown up a little and can make it work this time.      Somehow I doubt that.      Can't wait until tomarrow morning..       If you want to destroy my sweater,     I don't want to destroy your tank-top.     Hold this thread as I walk away.      Let's be friends and just walk away.     Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked.      Hate to see you lyin' there in your Superman skivvies     Lying on the floor, lying on the floor     I've come undone
