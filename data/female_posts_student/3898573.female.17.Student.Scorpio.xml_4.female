Last night when I was talkin to him on AIM, he all of a sudden was just like "oh, btw, sorry about the way I was acting the other night". He just up and apologized and I didnt' even have to bring it up or anything.  Awww! He's such a good guy, he really is.  He's comin with us bowling tonight.  Right now, it's a definite on me, Ashley, Shelly, RL, and Jacob.  Amy is a maybe and Megan is a maybe.  I hope Ashley invites Micheala too if she's workin.  I have to work again tonight, but we're goin to go at like 10 to Rock N Bowl.  It'll be cool.  Jacob doesn't know how bad I suck at bowling yet tho.  I'll be sure to warn him before we get there, I think I have to go pick him up.  He's supposed to call me while I'm at work (Mrs. B won't like that but I don't really care).  Well, I'm gonna get off here and exercise and shower and all that fun stuff.
