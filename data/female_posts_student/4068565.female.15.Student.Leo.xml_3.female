Around 2 mom came home saying Grandpa was home and it was all good. We washed the car and I got to scrub the inside...Its weird how my parents do extra cleaning when people come...Never cleaned the car tho...Arik you are special. LoL So...we did that...Had the first family supper all week...First time mom was home all week...I swear. Then we went over and saw my Grandpa. He looked really good...Gave him a big hug and it was good cuz he was smiling and everything. Im glad he wasnt as bad as he was last week. Then we came home and I sat around...talked to Arik for the longest time. Then went to bed. Woke up late today. Im soo drained...I think all this stress came on now...and I needed sleep. So I missed church..and didnt clean the library...I was so extreamly tired. So I sat around till 3:15ish when Rich came and picked me up so I could babysit their grandchildren...Tanner (4)  and Garret (2). Cutest things ever! Garret was sooo cute. I wanted to take him home with me. I love kids. So we had a good time...played with trains and trucks...and all that fun stuff. Watched soo many train movies...wow. They were very obsessed with trains. It was a good time tho....sooooo cute. I want my little boy to be like Garret. So adorable...he said my name like Tawah. It was very cute. I had a great time with them...but by the end I was getting very tired....and Im still up...*sigh* I talked to Arik tonight...and he keeps saying hes not the perfect boyfriend....but he is. He has no idea...how perfect he is. *sigh* I love him sooo very much and thats never going to change......Well I really should head off to bed....watch I end up staying up till 2....Probably...anyways im out.  -Tara
