LoL whats funny tho is she was asking the questions i was about to ask, so i didnt look so dumb lol Well last night i came home and i was sooo tired lol i like fell right asleep and i never do that lol Today i am gonna clean my room hardcore and my car. I cant stand it when things are messed up or there is clutter lol Then tomorrow im prolly gonna relax bc i have school Monday. Im actually excited to start school, as weird as that sounds. Im ready to see all my friends and just have the best year of my life. Since everyone is friends again and there is no drama going on. lol  I know tonight i might go out with some friends. Who knows, it all depends on who calls and i can tell u right now, heather will lol That girl calls me more than anyone, and its those calls where u answer and they are like whats up and u answer and u just sit there lol theres actually silence on the phone! lol at least i can talk about nothing and make a convo. lol One of my many talents lol Well i am gonna jam, so i can clean my car and room. i will write in here later!!
