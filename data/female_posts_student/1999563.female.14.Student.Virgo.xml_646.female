And if you mess up, lets just hope it wasn't your favorite t.  So, first I cut up my Footloose shirt so now I look like 80s trash! Woohooo! but I cut it a little to short so when I move my arms you can see SKIN. AH! Not CYT apropriate. Because you know my stomach fat is quite seductive. Well, it doesn't show that much..but..yeah.  So then I moved on to my "Bonjour Paris" shirt I got from the great UO. It may have been 22 dollars at the time of purchase, but that was a while ago. It needed a makeover!! Haha. So I cut off the sleeves like totally and made them do up the neck at an angle. It looks hot. And it is quite modest tooo!    That picture doesn't really show off the real beauty of that shirt, but it's super cool! Here is a photo...   Oh my goodness. In all my excitment to get home I forget to tell you the most exciting thing that happened at the BEACH. I found my dads box of old records!!!!!! he had RUBBER SOUL!!! And that cool Pink Floyd album. My dad has the BEST records. I am going to buy a record player for my room and just play them. He had like 200 records of every band you could imagine. I also found some of my moms records. They were all like Barbara Streisand and I was like "MOM YOU LISTENED TO THIS??? Hahhahahahhahahahahhaha"  It was great.  Here are some photos..  here are the some of the best records..you can't really see what ones they are, but trust me, they rock!   My dad showing off his pink floyd "dark side of the moon" 8 track. Hahahhaha   Beatles record on a record player, pure joy.    Ooh, and sorry for you people who don't like me to post so many pictures, I can't stop me!  :)  Oh, i'm thinking of deleting my shout box and just having the comments, but if I do you guys better post comments!!!!!! Does this sound ok?
