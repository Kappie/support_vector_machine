You held my hand and walked me home I know  While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh  You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?  Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love  Guys are so hard to trust  Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?  The one who gives it all away  Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck  Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget  I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset  Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said  Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who, throws it all away  This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong  Any thoughts of you and me have gone away  Better off that way  I'm better off alone anyway     yea thats 4 u mutha fucka, ya know exactly who u r
