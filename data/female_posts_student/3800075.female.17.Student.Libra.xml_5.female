Nothin big though... Adam and Casey set up some lights in the backyard- looks pretty schweet.  Me and jacklie sat in the hot tub while they messed around with the lights and such.  Yeah so i dont have much to say. Noah and Grant are in town with Leslie and Michelle. Schilly kids. I bet they are havin fun! more power to 'em. Welp thats about all for tonight. So remember..... Fight the power- Stay clean.  Until Time Next
