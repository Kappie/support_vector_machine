Well.. let me describe to you... there was a lot of yelling and screaming over absolutely STUPID things that made no sense at all and did not connect.. there was a lot of tears and slamming and stomping and cursing out every god ever known to human kind. .. and it ended with a sharp knife to my wrist..  I made my little brother cry.. without even meaning to.... I seriously upset my Dad... he didn't get angry.. just got.. one of those looks... y'know.. like a wounded animal or something...  Needless to say... all th'medicine in the house got locked back up, along with a good majority of the sharp objects.  I have to go back to that stupid Doctor. They're going to put me back on anti-depressants... Which only makes me feel worse.  I want my Mom more than ever now.  What happened to feeling safe?  Someone.. please.. I'll give you every cent to my name.. just put a damn bullet in my head. Now.      Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah,oh  She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside.
