Continuing on in my journey of life, the pain only rears it's ugly head, tearing me down. Making me want to give up, curl up and stay. Not moving on, not falling behind, just...there. Many times i wish i could be void, null, with no emotions, just existing. Numerous people have told me that burying past events doesnt help, to me, it does, to a certian extent. Now, i don't recall everything about it, i just remember bits and pieces. i remember being pounced on, i remember the pain of it, and i remember clawing at the carpet to get away, thats what i remember most vividly, my nails raking across the floor, pulling myself away under his weight. After that, i just remember crying, curling up and crying. i've forgiven the person, i've tried moving on, but the memories still haunt me, i still wake up scared. Perhaps after writing this, finally sharing it, i can move on. i know that it will still hurt, but atleast i will heal, understand it wasnt my fault. It wasn't. He has apologized to me so many times, i'm numb to it now. What's done is done. i'd rather not talk about it, thats like reliving it. It could of been a lot worse. i'm lucky.
