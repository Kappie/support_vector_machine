At first, she suggested flowers, but we both think that flowers are not unique and it is useless. Then, I suggested that she draw a portrait for Flora. Too bad, both of us are bad in drawing. So, I said that we can explain to Flora that the portrait imitating Picasso's cubism style of art! Below is a picture of Picasso's work that I think is very FUNNY when you try to imagine Flora looking like that!!!!  Heheehehe... looks as though it is a portait of Flora picking her nose! Hahahahaa...     Dora Maar by Picasso (copied from the Internet)   Yeah, I don't know how to appreciate how "beautiful" this painting is! I really wonder why people would pay millions for such a portrait.  :P   **Please feel free to make any comments
