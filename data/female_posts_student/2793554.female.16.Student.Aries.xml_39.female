Im excited. melissa cut off all her hair and it was exciting.  I had a pretty crappy day i guess, i hate fairview. And my feet were all wet cause i had to chase after my moms car with no shoes on.. and then she made me walk to the bus stop cause i took too long. But oh, before that she told me something like "she never meant to have a daughter like ME" which is not something that makes you happy first thing in the morning. So i walked ot the bus stop crying, like in some dumb movie.   I LOVE SKA!  I'm wearing 4 socks.   I'm happy now because i love melissa and i love dylan and i love jessie and im having fun.  bihawk time!!!    abby
