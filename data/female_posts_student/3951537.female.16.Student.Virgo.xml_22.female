Best of college acapella, ah, beauty. I'm super excited about it. It's so... pretty. I love people with gorgeous voices. (esp aussies, matty *drool*- go listen to river, you'll know what I'm talking about). Anyhow, recently got home from the Bourne Supremacy, a movie I really enjoyed. I need to watch it again to count the accidents/how many cars that cab REALLY hit. Hmm, for a detailed analysis see my lj. Ha ha. Like you can. Nevermind. Don't worry about it.  The moon is gorgeous tonight. It's all covered with grey clouds and all that. It's a bit stormy outside. But the moon looks like it comes straight out of some painting. I would really love to go lie in the park and stare at the sky right now, but its 11pm, and my parents would kill me if they found me out for frolicking about in the park in the dark. (I shall take it home with me. I shall call it Clark) I'm in a funky mood. I was a lot happier earlier. I think that the caffeine is wearing off.  To continue a previous rant, here's another reason why it's good to be a techie: you get to keep your script. For me, when I'm doing a job like stage managing, my script becomes a living entity, a chronicle of all the stupid things people say during rehearsals. Then, every time I reach that page, I have something to laugh at. For example, during Forum, every daty we reached page 67 or so of Neal's script, Neal and Alex would both say "Help! Help! We're surrounded by Republicans!" This quote originates from Roz. Neal wrote it down on that page, so every day we'd be amused. It kept us happy. Good times. I miss them. I wanna be a freshman again. I want those people back. I'm sick of being in charge. When we were freshmen, it was all "I can't wait till we're seniors" but now I would happily relive any of my younger years in theatre. I'll pass on the school part, though, hell, the homework would be easier. Well, that's enough out of me. I'm whining tonight. I'll just stop. I annoy me.
