The water wasn't cold at all, it was just the right temperature.  The only icky things were:  walking through mud near the shore to get to the packed down part and the deeper water, and some creepy guy that was looking at Melissa and me smearing sun block on.  When the latter happened, we moved down shore quite a bit to try and get out of his sight.  It was gross!  Anyhow, other than that... nothing else happened today.  Had a good time with Melissa, though... wish that others could have come along.  Anyhow, on a sad note, Jamey won't be taking American Sign Language with me... :-(  Oh well... we're going to meet up on campus now that we'll both be in the same place... and she's now Hellbent on finding my Mr. Right.  haha  It's so cute.... but Jamey IS (after all) one of the people that knows me best.  So, it's cool.  Anyhow... not much more to say right now except... BOYS ARE STUPID... THROW ROCKS AT THEM!!!!!!  (Damn you Richard Biggs!  How do you feel about YOUR impending trip to Hell?!?!)
