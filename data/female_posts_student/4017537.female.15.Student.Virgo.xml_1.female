I don't know what to call it. I'm happy, inquisitive, excited, creative, "into" the music (whatever that means), and everything else all jumbled into one. I'm really happy because I just burned some Nirvana cds and also Greenday and Third Eye Blind. I need to go to the library so I can get some more cds to burn. I feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution now but that would mean I have to turn off the radio and I don't want to do that. And you know what? Someone wants to be my blueberry popsicle. Weirdo.Damn. I wish I felt like this all the time. I need some more Diet Coke. I'm addicted. I'm so addicted to you... and you're suck a dick to me. I think I'm getting arthritis. But I think it's just because I've been typing nonstop for hours. I'm going to go now. Peace.
