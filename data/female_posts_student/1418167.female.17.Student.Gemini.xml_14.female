I'm sure they all had a fabulous time. Morgan was apparently the choir slut.  Hehe . I saw Eric today which was glorious and he told me that he is directing Barefoot in the Park this year.  Lovely.  I am going to be doing the cabaret and it will great, simple, elegant fun.  I gave Miles a ton of the paperbacks which Mom and I read. She is reading The Notebook as I type this, most likely off of the sugar high from the  insanely lethal cookies  we had today. She and Xander and I had a grand time dancing to her mix in the car. Poor Xander didn't get to steal it though.  Sad.  Perhaps I'll steal it first.     We sit here Silently Watching the ducks  And eating mystery meat   We wait here  Lying  In a dandelion ring Tossing toothpicks in the air  We dance here  Serving  In a sea of comedy  With words we've never heard  We help here  Smiling Seeing it clearly A group of good hearts and minds  We laugh here  Waiting  Random anticipation  Falling over onto gravel   We love here  Reeling  Day like no other And the dandelions sing...
