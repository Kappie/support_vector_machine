 It's in the corner of the huge ball/kenduri/living room which is just too large to air-condition. And the fan is ineffective in this heat. 

 So I am suffering while sitting here at the computer. 

 I can't stand it. And since most of my work consists of sitting in front of the computer, I'm not getting it done. 

 I'm miserable. I hate the heat. I hate sweating. 

 I hate whining.
