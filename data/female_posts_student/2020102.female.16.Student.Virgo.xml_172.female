Mr. McVeigh's last meal, on May 16, should not involve bloodshed and the slaughter of an unwilling victim. The other animals feel every bit as much pain as we do, they are horrified at the sight and smells of the slaughterhouse, and they're afraid to die. Like us, they fight for their lives and wish to avoid pain. Please don't let Timothy McVeigh be responsible for the death of even one more living being." - Bruce Friedrich of PETA in a letter to Timothy McVeigh's warden And the response: "I cannot sustain a prolonged intellectual debate on the subject as my time is short, but I'd suggest hitting Ted Kaczynski up for his opinions on the subject." - Timothy McVeigh
