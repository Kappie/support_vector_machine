Okay…silly little fantasy of me calling him up and it goes really well and I confess to writing him all these love letters and he says “Love letters?” and I say ”More like f*** letters,” (hehehe) and he says “So…no love letters?” and I say “Well, yeah, some love letters,” and he says “Good.” And I am impossibly happy, heart swelling up and bursting over.   i am so entirely desperate. maybe i should just call nate. or maybe adam saylor...no i'm kidding. i love that kid. i think he's so adorable and as soon as i can [date] i am going to ask him out. he's so sweet.  melanie thinks that the following guys had crushes on me freshmen year:  drew (well, duh.) derek (ick.) frankie (see  drew .) ben (i think i'm going to be sick.) adam (yeah, that's probably right.) will (huge gasping surprise. she did admit that he stares at me whenever i'm around, though. very nice) tyler brush (not sure. )   and i'm adding:  nate (deep down, there is something there, i swear.) denver (who i don't think you know about, megan, but i thought he has been giving me the cold shoulder since i accidentally called him dallas. oops. apparently not, seeing as he goes out of his way to talk to me.) ken (for like, all of two seconds)  can't wait to see school. can wait, however, for school to see me. haha. call me when you get back from the middle of nowhere, meike.  tchus! liebe, katja von aschenbrenner (did i type that outloud?! silly me.)
