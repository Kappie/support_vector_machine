That's not at all true, actually... but I figured that Mel-dawg would appreciate my tribute to Saves The Day.  :-)  I'm currently at Melissa's apartment... we came up to Austin today, because we found out that the They Might Be Giants movie is still playing here at Dobie.  :-)  YAY!  So, we get to see it together IN THE THEATER afterall!  Aside from being here, I'm having a good time doing stuff for work.  :-)  Training has become really fun!!!  I get to see Nick all the time, and flirt a lot... and Greg as well... though, even if I COULD date Greg (he's my direct superior... so it's against handbook rules) I wouldn't... He's really fun though... we laugh so much... it's great... As for Heather... I'm not caring too much to work with her for the next year.  :-(  Oh well, maybe it'll get better, especially since Mr. Henry (He's the Site Manager for our Region) gave a lecture to us today in our region meeting about not acting better than our fellow workers because we should be a small family... a team (for those of us who are competitive).  I hope that the year will go well, though I'm sure it will because Greg and I have HUGE plans for musical opportunities with the kiddos.  It's going to be absolutely great.  Man, something funny happened today regarding Sexual Harassment... if you care to know, ask!  :-)  I'm not posting it on here for ANYONE... plus, it'd just take WAY TOO LONG to type it all out!  :-\  Anyhow, me and Melissa need to leave here in a few minutes, so I shall end this post and have lotsa fun with my pal...  Auf Wiedersehen!
