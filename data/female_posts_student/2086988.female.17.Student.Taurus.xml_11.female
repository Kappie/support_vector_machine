Algebra district assessment I think went well, I'll find out friday. Ummm History, well I got 29 out of the 60 multiple choice questions right, so I made a 35% out of like 70% on the MC part of the test, hey I didn't get the lowest and hopefully I did good on the essays, plus he's going to curve it, so yeah I hope I passed. I just wish I did better on the MC, ahhhh oh well that test was fark hard, lol. Chemistry was ok, I'll know on Friday, I think I did well. So all I have tomorrow is English I have about 50 pgs left to read in 1984, then I need to study for my German test. But at least this day is over and hopefully with these freaking assesments I didn't totally screw up my GPA :(. Well I'm really tired, so I'm going to take a nap.   Well I want to take you as I find you  Imagine our clothes are on the floor  Feel my caress so soft and gentle  So delicate you cry for more  You know baby does it right
