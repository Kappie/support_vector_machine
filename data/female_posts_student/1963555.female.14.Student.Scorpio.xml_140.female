I missed my bus the other day because since we have exams they doubled them up, and I had no idea where mine was, I think I did actually, but they were so full, I didn't wanna have to fight for a seat or sit with people I don't know, so I walked to Dacia's. So Monday, I'm going to carry my stuff after my first exam, and then once the second one is over I'm going to run out-side go to the bus I think is mine ask the driver if she goes to my road, and grab a seat before everyone else fills in. Good plan....
