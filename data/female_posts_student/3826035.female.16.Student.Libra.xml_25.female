I know, I'm such a girl, but I'm actually frightened of going back to school next month. It's a new school and everything, and this means I finally don't have to associate with people, but there's always that little voice in the back of my head that is totally fucking convinced that I'm going to screw everything up. It's sort of my last chance to prove myself, here...  I'm just a little tired of not being taken seriously. People saying that manga isn't an art, or that I'll never go anywhere because I have no useful talent. I'm rather sick of it. Wouldn't you be? If someone, who was really close to you, said that you had nothing useful to contribute to society.  *sighs* And now, I have to figure out how to find a way around society, if that is even possible.  And then, the wiping clean of the slate! I get to start over, in a way! Start a new life, and I can let go of everything. All those people, all the things that happened, all the stress... I can slowly re-adjust myself to people and the rest of the world, without being a total nervous wreck all the time. It's hard to forget things, though, when they keep breaking through the ice beneath my feet. Maybe come winter the water will have thickened a little more, and so will my skin. It'll be a little easier that way.  But for now, I'll stay home. I'll work on my book, study religeon, do my homework, play video games till my eyeballs fall out, spend time with Eris (my oboe), bake cookies, see movies, walk my dog, meet people for coffee, maybe martial arts even! Why not. And when I'm ready, I'll get a job. Then I can save for my education, and buy all the manga and comic books and art supplies my small little room can possibly hold.  Well, I'm going to burn CDs... the converter hath 'dinged' insistently at me...
