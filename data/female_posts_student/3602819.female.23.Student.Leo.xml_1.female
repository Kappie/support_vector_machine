More so everyone in high school and under). So what does it mean? I was pondering this (among many things) today. We are a culture that is bloated with love... Retaining all of the "love" we have, but we never have any place to get rid of it, because we don't know how, so we just remain bloated. In the Greek language, there are 3 words for love... THREE! We only have one. We have to emphasize what love really is... "No man, I   LOVE   you..." Okay... That's all for today. Just pondering on the vast greatness of God, wondering how He can LOVE us so much, while we don't even understand what true love really is... Questions? Comments? Good jokes? Bring it on... LOVE!!!!
