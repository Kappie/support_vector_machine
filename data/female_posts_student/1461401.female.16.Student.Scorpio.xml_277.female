       
      I'll stay up till ten, before I start my homework. I'll stay up till ten, reading a book I stole from Kari. I'll stay up till ten, thinking about the view of my neighborhood from my perch in my tree. I'll stay up till ten, wondering what I ought to do about tomorrow, and the day after. I'll stay up till ten, make some poor excuse for myself, then go to bed without doing my homework. Then, I'll stay up till two, or until I drown in the puddle of tears that will be on my pillow. But I still won't know what to do about tomorrow, or the day after.
