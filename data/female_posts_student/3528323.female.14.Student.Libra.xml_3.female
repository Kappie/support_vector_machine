It's so0o much healthier and i like it a lot better than how my hair was...long and yucky looking!! lol It looks cute when I flip it out!!   But today in State Requirements our "homework" tonite is..."You are getting married...to who? where? who's in it? where is your honeymoon?" Okay this question is kind of hard...I'm just a kid and I don't know! I'm trying to decide between like 3 guys!! lol My mom said to marry Brendan...because she thinks we are going to end up together...which is kinda grosse cuz hes like my bro!! lol But there are two other guys that I'm not sure if I should say them infront of the class but whatever i will probably just pick one by the time its my turn tomorrow! It will be fun...I bet every girl in that class will pick Joe Harden!! haha   Tomorrow is gonna be hecka fun!! I'm going over to Lauren's house for the weekend cuz my mama is going out of town and my grandma is in minnesota and my bro is going to bakersfield for a bball tourney and its graduation week down at SCU and chloe is in italy so basically there is no place for me to go so im going over to Lauren's!! Im looking forward to it actually!! After summer school her mom is taking us over to the mall (YAY) and then later we are going to Lincoln Center Live which should be fun if the right person will be there!! Ãœ hehehe!! And then Saturday she has a 2 dance recitals (BLAH) one in the morning and one later...so i think i will go to the morning one while kdub is at bball then stay home with kdub and ball him up on the court!! lol!!!! its gonna be fun!!!   I'm kind of sore today!! I fell on the ground i dont know how many times and didnt play good at all!! I hate it when i dont play good it makes me mad!! Oh well!! My leg really hurts and I dont know why!!! But whatever I will be fine...as my brother says...i love how he shows a lot of sympathy towards my pain!! hahaha!!! Oh well!!!  "If you turn into this center turn lane...you will DIE!"
