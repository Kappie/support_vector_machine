I've been trying to get in shape a lot lately. I've been drinking lots of water, stretching every night, playing tennis, and roller blading. Also, I'm REALLY close to doing the splits! Go me! And, I've lost about 15 pounds since Christmas! The only bad thing is that I keep gaining pounds by giving into my favorite foods like chocolate. Once I start eating it, I can't stop! I really need to start learning to grab a fruit or another glass of water every time I get hungry. But, it's nice to know your accomplishing something out of your hard work!  I'm really excited about starting High School a little now. I'm taking Dance next year as a PE credit, and I think I'm really going to enjoy it! I'm also excited about meeting new people and starting classes and stuff. The only thing I'm really afraid of is the hard work and the thing that I may choose things like electives that I'll regret in the future... I hope I made the right choice! OO! That reminds me! I need to tell the High School counselor that I'm taking Spanish! I've decided to nix Theater, because I can always do extra things like plays at Frisco Community Theater. I just hope I'm not loading myself up with work for school! I have a problem with procrastinating. I always put my homework off to real late at night, and then I'll play on the computer or watch TV during the afternoon. It's real bad, and I need to stop so I can do well in High School!  On Wednesday, I'm leaving for a Mah Jongg Tournament in Tyler, Texas. Mah Jongg is this really funky, challenging Chinese game with a bunch of tiles and stuff. It's confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's second nature to you and you can start tricking other people up.  I really need to start getting back to writing poems. I used to write poems all the time, but now I'm really slacking. I think I'll write one tonight, but I need to get some sort of inspiration. I adore writing poems, and it's wierd not writing them for so long. If I write one tonight, I'll let you see it tomorrow.  I think this is probably the longest entry I've written. Hmm. That's funny. I just started babbling on here and I got all this! Oh well! I guess I'm just very luquacious! (luquacious = very talkative)  Hugs and kisses!
