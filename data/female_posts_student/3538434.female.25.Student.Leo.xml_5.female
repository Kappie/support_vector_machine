Well, I'd like to extend an invitation to the group to come to my home, perhaps for our June 22nd meeting?  I'd be happy to make sangria for everyone and come up with a topic as well.  We can stay here for a couple of hours and then head out, depending on what everyone wants to do.  Vincent has no problem making himself scarce for the evening :)  We can discuss it at tomorrow's meeting!  See you then.  xo Apryl
