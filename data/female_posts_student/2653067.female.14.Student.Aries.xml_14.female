Not much has happened since the 19th. My birthday's coming up on the 29th (5 days).  I can't wait to get my presents, my sneakers and a webcam.  Tomorrow is my last day of school this week.  We get out at 12:00 and we don't have any school on Friday. I was sort of dissapointed to learn from a friend that they wouldn't come to my school (if they had a pro d day and I didn't) because it's too far away.  I've got more news refering the nameless person but I don't really feel like discussing it in my blog.   Well I gotta go. See ya later.                                                                            -Julie  PS- Theres only 6 episodes of the oc left this season!  Noooo!!
