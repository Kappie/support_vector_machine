But, the question on everyone's lips is who killed Mr Body? I think it was Laura, but she wasn't in the game... I'm also wondering why I'm not asleep but I'm not finding the answer... Oh and hey Minton isn't that scary... sorry about the delayed annoyance that's me. Nothing to type, compared to everything else this has to be the most boring blog ever... Oh, sorry Izzy, I forgot to look at your blogs. Wow! Mine looks like a masterpiece now! (Hehe) Scroll down to see better ones or e-mail  urlLink notyetcracked@hotmail.com  to correct my spelling or otherwise annoy me. Have a nice day!
