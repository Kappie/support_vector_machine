I'm glad I got to meet her :) We get to decorate with her again next week so it should be fun.   Kel's mom ordered us pizza too, which was really excellent of her. So, good times, good people, "Two thumbs up. Fine holiday fun." If anyone can tell me where that quote is from..I'll, I don't know, I'll do whatever you want.   I've had this song stuck in my head since last night. Someone had it in their profile and I listened to it and it got stuck in my head. It's a great song though so...it's ok that it's stuck in my head.  There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
