So we're looking all over for a bill they may have sent and online for a number to call or a place to pay. We finally found the number, and guess what...they changed the date of payment to August 16th and they didn't bother to tell anyone. So that was eventful. But other than that, I've just been working and packing my stuff up to go to college. I'm half excited and half not. I'm so excited because I'm getting all new stuff and I get to leave home and all the exciting stuff that happens to college. But I'm not going to get to see most of my friends...oh and Ryan, except for like once or twice a month. It's crappy, but I'm sure with all the fun of college, I'll be able to deal :) OMG! I had this dream that Laura and I were in a room with 2 girls...and they were LOVERS! Wouldn't that be horrible? I'm sure they'd be cool and all, but I'd be so paranoid all the time. Aha. Well, I gotta jet. I love you like a sister!          Peace and Love,      Melissa
