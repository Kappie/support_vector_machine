I think you'd have to have a certain kind of taste to appreciate them, however; just check them out!  TIME WASTER!!! W00t!!  I am:: not necessarily, for "all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream" (Poe) I crave:: my bed I regret:: being an idiot at times I cry:: fairly easily. It's a good way to release stress, in a way... I hate crying around people, though, although sometimes it just happens I care:: too much; about most people and my cats... and the fish, too I feel alone:: even while immersed in crowds, sometimes I listen:: when I don't have a badhead (headache) I hide:: my unopened shaving gel (my sister takes it) I know:: a few languages I need to know:: whether I have to take the TOEFL or not... lots of other things would be helpful, too I wonder:: whether there will come a day I'll understand I give:: coffee and as much support as I can offer I feel:: in pain; my back hurts last cigarette: I've never had one and don't really want to ever have one... yuck last kiss: does my stuffed bunny count? last good kiss: n/a last good cry: no cries are really good, come to think of it... I cried a storm when I got in the wreck, so maybe that'd be it... but perhaps the most releasing crying session came on the last day before spring break this past school year last library book checked out: uhm, I think  Cracking the AP Chemistry Exam  by the Princeton Review... last movie seen: on video,  The Truman Show ; in theaters,  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (excellent, go watch it!)  last cuss word uttered: I've been pretty good about breaking the cursing mode I'd been getting into, but I called myself a "f---ing moron" many times after the wreck Last food consumed: a few cookies with coffee  last phone call: The Hair Salon to remind me of my appointment tomorrow... before that, Heather last tv show watched: likely either  Just Shoot Me  or  Mad About You  last cd played: Jimmy Eat World -  Jimmy Eat World  last soda drank: uhm... a Coke, I think last word spoken: "Give me your laundry. It's either now or never!" so "never" last amused: likely yesterday when I took my fan apart to figure out what was wrong with the light and when I put it back up and saw it didn't work daddy came by, pulled the string, and there was light... hehe... forgot about american fans doing that last time wanting to die: probably after the wreck  last time in love: "what's love got to do, got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion?" (Tina) last time hugged: I hugged mom because I was so excited about the trip. It was a thank you for sending me. last shirt worn: well if you count what I slept in, it was some white undershirt/tank top...really comfy; otherwise, an oversized Converse College comfy t-shirt because I was home last time dancing: I dance around all the time even though I can't dance. If you mean clubbing, I can't do that yet. And if you mean party... ehhh... a few months ago! current clothes: my pj shorts with cats on them and a Centre of the Performing and Visual Arts t-shirt... yeah, I'll go shower and get crap done soon... promise... current mood:: lazy current music: The Postal Service  Current Song : "Nothing Better" current taste: coffee current hair: reaaaaaaally long... and I got out of bed a few hours ago and never did brush it yet... it gets cut tomorrow, so I'm spending my last hours with it down! current annoyance: having to miss the 311 concert and Clint's graduation current smell: uhm. nothing really... I'm just sitting here. current thing I should be doing: cleaning/running errands/making phone calls/such current refreshment: V8 (I love this stuff! Poo on all ye people who think it's gross... mmm... tomatoes!) current worry: AP English-- getting those boring books read, college, getting in, getting scholarships, such stuff Would you ever date someone younger than you?: well, I'm at an age in which it's not really easy to find anyone decently mature at my own age, so, right now, probably not... maybe when I'm 25, but even then, I tend to always like older guys for one reason or another (not that much older though, 4 years is my uber limit... honest!) Ever been drunk? not quite... more like buzzed. Only twice. With my parents. On New Year's... at home. Been in love? infatuation- most definitely; love- I don't really know  Loved someone who you knew you couldn't have? I probably thought there was a chance if I even bothere, so likely not Broken a bone? more than one... I'm me. Of course I've messed up joints and broken bones! Had your heart broken? something like that, maybe not quite that Last time you said I love you to someone: hmmm... last night? Last time you laughed: likely earlier today. I laugh a lot. What age do you see yourself married at? that's waaaaay not something I'm really thinking about currently... let's get into college and graduate from there, too, first-- how about that? Do you sleep with a stuffed animal? of course How many homes have you lived in total? something around 10, I'm not going to start counting One pillow or two? two Do you get along with your parents? not really. Daddy isn't easy to communicate with anymore since the stroke although we used to be very close, and mom and I just can't get along if we're together for more than an entired day. We've been getting along okay, though, because I try to distance myself when I feel it's time to do so Whats your favorite color(s)? blue Do you work?

Broken someone's heart: probably so Cried when someone died: yes Wanted someone you knew you couldn't have: perhaps, but not too seriously Lied: yes. Everyone has. Cried in school: quite a few times-- in actual CLASS, the only two instances I can recall are that test over complex division in second grade and then the time B made me cry this year WHICH IS BETTER Coke or Pepsi: Coca Cola!  Sprite or 7UP: hmm.. tough... I like them both Girls or Guys: well, because I'm straight, I like guys, but then most of them turn out to be jerks anyway, so my trust for them is already nearly worn thin and tends to lie in a few close girl friends who can understand a lot better Flowers or candy: candy is a bad thing on so many levels, but I like it. Some flowers are good! Let's go with flowers. Honeysuckles, any one?  Scruff or Clean shaved: it really depends on the guy; some look good one way, some the other Tall or Short: I wish I were a little taller, so tall Pants or Shorts: pants THE LAST TIME: Showered: 4 am (yeah, I know... but I had to get some stuff done and play some Final Fantasy!)
