Amidst cries of a lost cell phone (my parents'), sleeping in a little too many hours, and unsuspectingly placing a binder on an wooden desk that was a piece of art (oopsy... And sorry for the umpteenth time), I found my paintings for analysis within five minutes of stepping into the museum. Of course, the fact that it was a rather small building for a state university made it easier. If I were at the Metropolitan Museum, it would take me half the day to find one painting even with directions from people who work there. Then I miscalculated the time it would take me to gather the notes for the paintings and yeah... I ended up waiting outside for a half an hour before I got picked up. Yep, opted for heat instead of the freezing museum.  Afterwards, a party at a friend's. Silent Marco Polo demonstrated how I was lousy at finding people with my eyes closed. Honestly... It was one of the more embarrassing moments of my life. Of course, embarrassment reached a peak when I ended up over turning in a backwards somersault and rammed by elbows onto the steps and my head connected with the decorative but hard rocks at the rim of the pool. I guess I could blame the desert theme of the pool for the red scratches on my elbow. Eekies. At last, I was deemed incapable of playing board games (along with the inability to play pool games) when I was "killed" after four rounds of rolling the dice. Meh, I did get a cute little llama finger puppet from the party host. She just got back from Peru and I got a new addition to my postcard collection! It's a rocky condor... Or rather the floor plan of an Incan ruin was in the shape of a condor.  Now I am back home wondering when I would have time to actually finish Catch-22 for my book club composed of the friends at the party. Technically, I should have been done by the last weekend of May and for June, Eragon and The Solitaire Mystery. Definitely need to catch up on reading since we are to finish Sinclair's The Jungle by next weekend.
