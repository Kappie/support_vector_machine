Yesterday felt like the big Heart day; probably because I found myself at the mall (in the middle of the afternoon!  GASP!) surrounded by cards, decorations, sales.  I'm a fan, I have to say.  Valentine's day is our friend.  Even those of us who don't like to admit it and hide behind a veil of faux ambivalence/hostility like it just a bit.  They just don't like their aloneness; not that they should, but still.  It's just a cute little holiday that comes out of nowhere and is a nice pick-me-up in the barren void of celebrations left by Christmas and New Year's.    So yea, made it out to the mall yesterday for something other than a birthday card or a pound of coffee.  And have a terribly over-priced, retro-ugly, history-in-the-making new shirt to show for it.  Yay!  It's a terrible combination of sky/baby blue and '70s green shag carpet, sporting the stylish felt lettering announcing "Greenwich Village, NY Speech and Debate", complete with a big green bird mascot and gold star as background.  It's hideous and gorgeous in its hideousness.  It's such a Pride shirt; I can't wait to take it to Seattle this summer.  Sure, I overspent by at least $15 (and that's including the 20% off), but I already love it and am not ashamed.    Stayed out too late, but it was worth seeing Monster.  Charlize sooo has the Oscar in the bag.  I just hope she uses her power for good now.  It's a fool's hope, I realize, but we've seen what those can do for people!  And hobbits!  It didn't leave me as discombobulated as I anticipated, which was nice.  But Charlize's performance certainly has stuck around in the back of my mind, which isn't entirely all that pleasant, but what can you do?  Anyway, as a result of my latenight excursions, I was left in a less than stellar position to kick ass on the final draft of my writing assignment today.  Woke up too early to be refreshed, but too late to go back to sleep.  Felt hungover only without the alcohol and great stories.  Hated that the easy, relaxed week would have to be kicked and pummeled to loosen its grasp on my work-ethic.  So I pouted in three morning pages and felt a bit better.  Got a surprise call from the Boy and by noon, the day was looking up.    Worked for a bit on said paper, mostly shaping up what I had, inserting parenthetical suggestions like:  (Expand net line, incorporating it into "trick".)   and  (Reyes: discovered ruse; clearly the truck wasn't hurt and he was the subject of the search; the guy walked out into the street before he discovered the truth and that wasn't an intervening act)   and  (Garcia rebuttal: ruse was discovered/over before police were allowed into his house; here, she had already illegally entered by the time the ruse was discovered, tainting anything that came later; all wrapped up because she was admitted illegally)   throughout.  Hopefully they'll be helpful tomorrow when I (really, actually, honestly) go to town on it.  Made it to school around 2, typed up Friday's class notes and have been pretty successful at wasting the last hour.   Sigh.  At least my mood's been saved.  Think I'll go do the hunting/gathering routine, then do the nesting thing back at the hovel and see about maybe, just maaaybe doing a bit more paper-work before closing the day down.    Random thought: I miss Juno and Isaac.
