(wow i love how i always start off my blog the same way... love.)  k so my day. it=pretty awesome.  this morning, you-know-who was on my bus... so that automatically made my day cool. after my bus ride, i started walking to school from downtown... when, who did i bump into? your friendly neighbourhood liz of course. so instead of walking to school, i walked back downtown with her to wait for jeff, who was meeting her at 8:30-ish. buuut he didn't show up at that time, and i had to go to school, or i would be late... and liz didn't come with me. so i cried [secretly].  so school was kind of boring... but i only went for half the day. cuz i had an orthodontist appointment at 2:30, and cuz i had to take the bus there, i had to leave at 1:15. me=happy that i missed baseball in gym. times 298483. so my appointment was fun... my teeth hurt, but hey. i found out i'm getting my braces off on july 19. isn't that awesome? that means i'll have them off by the time i go to england. sweet.  at lunch, i chilled with sofija for the first time in like... 2847393 years. she's a cool cat. oh, i also chilled with vanessa and sylvia... cuz they're cool too. i [heart] them all. times 3.  wow this=world's shorttest/most boring blog ever.  oooh this weekend=me going shopping because i'm getting my monthly allowance. but who with? please leave a comment if you want to go shopping... if i don't get back to you, then i most likely hate you/don't want to go with you. thanks. [me=joking.]  k welll nothing else to blog about. yeah my blogs officially suck.  i'm outtie now. paice.  in the depths of shadows, lingers my love for you.  kayte.
