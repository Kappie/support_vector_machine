(haha 2nd time that day) and jessica tryed buying a piece of pizza we could split but it was closing and so we got two extra pieces which worked out perfectly. 3 people. 3 pizzas. hah. anyways. then we walked back to sarahs and we hung out and stuff and then i watched sarah and jessica have a water fight in the front yard at like 10. i bet it was cold. lol. yeah. well that was my day.        ~alyssa~ :-*
