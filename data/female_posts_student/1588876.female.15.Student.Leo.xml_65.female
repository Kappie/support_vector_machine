"addie, don't do it. you're going to regret it."  "addie, FUCK HIM!!! FUCK HIM LIKE THE SEXUAL BEAST YOU ARE!!!!"  "well, you seem to each be going at the same pace and enjoying one another.  whatever."  i've actually been pretty censored with what i've been telling my friends lately, but everyone loves to play advice-hero. even when no one asks for it.   jesus christ. i've been doing some heavy sighing to accompany this deep decision making. i'm feeling a bit light-headed. i need to lie down and breathe through my mouth for a moment.  i want to, but then i don't know.  do it. dont do it. dont know.  i am taking all things into consideration.  as if i didnt have enough shit with my family going on. maybe i brought this weight upon myself...fuck, now i'm thinking about that. goddammit.  im so confused.   i hate adolescence. but then, i love it at the same time...   exactly.
