Tell me when you're up for a trip. I really should use the pool this summer. Last summer I went for three months without going in. That was the whole summer. I was an idiot.  I have to wash dishes tonight. Ew.  But Dad's home, so yay.  I need something to do tomorrow morning. No, I'm no isolated loner. Just let me find something to do. How far is Third Street from here? I'm tempted to make the trip alone. But would I spend that much? No. I better sit and think about it. I have the time.   Countdown to SSP: oh, I can't count anymore. (pauses, uses digits) 11 days.  There is something marvelous about a phone call. Any phone call. Someone wants to talk to you!  Did I say I was in a good mood? Yes, I did.   Lydia needs to calm down.  But smiling's always ok.
