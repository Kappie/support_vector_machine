Thank you all who are going but it just isnt the same.  i have no male friends at all. well ok kevin and ben.  but i see kevin once a month max. and then we go shopping which is just not a cool guy activity.  and ben is cool but i see him once every three months when i go to faca.  Kevin and Ben are both losers.  well ben not so much as kevin but still a little.  NOW Kevin is a huge loser.  it just so happens that his BEST friend is holding a party to celebrate a jewish holiday and kevin doesn't even ask for the day off.  and then on the tuesday before kevin tells him oh sorry can't go i hafta work.  THE TUESDAY BEFORE!!!  I am so upset.  everywhere i have ever gone my class and church has been mostly girls(for my age group).  i knew it was going to happen...i told someone only girls were coming and they were like ooh mackdaddy.  Not really.  i would SO much rather have guys.  girls are just blah blah blah hes going out with her and blah blah blah you straightened your hair ooohh blah blah blah
