Escape from emptiness, depression, and feelings of unreality.     In order to ease tension.     Relief: when intense feelings build, self-injurers are overwhelmed and unable to cope. By causing pain, they reduce the level of emotional and physiological arousal to a bearable one.     Expression of emotional pain.    Relief of anger: many self-injurers have enormous amounts of rage within. Afraid to express it outwardly, they injure themselves as a way of venting these feelings.     Exerting a sense of control over one's body.           just some random quotes i found that i liked ...     Per me si va nella citta dolente,   Per me si va nell'eterno dolore,Per me si va tra la perduta gente.Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate!(This way for the sorowful city,This way for eternal suffering,This way to join the lost people.All hope abandon, ye who enter here!)   -"Inferno," Dante Alighieri    "i hurt myself todayto see if i could feeli hurt myself you saidto try to make him feelso i hurt myself againto see if he'd see mei hurt myself againi know he never could see me."   -"Hurt (introduction to Caught a Lite Sneeze)," Tori Amos          "got a little red linethat tells you, boywhere the razor's been."   -"Never Seen Blue," Tori Amos          "Self-injury is a sign of distress not madness. We should be congratulated on having found a way of surviving."   -Cory Anderson          "Pain is always preferable to numbness."   -"Triage," Scott Anderson    "I'll draw you a picture,I'll draw it with a twist,I'll draw it with a razorblade,I'll draw it on my wrist.And if I draw it correctly,a red fountain will appear...to wash away my sorrows,to chase away my fears."   -Anonymous        "Icy claws with tender touches are the gifts she brings to me. Swallowed in the mindless void of sex and misery."   -Anonymous        "Well in case you failed to notice,In case you failed to see,This is my heart bleeding before you,This is me down on my knees."   -"Foolish Games," Jewel        "'Cutting myself was something beyond despair, something very extreme,’ Johnstone says, speaking in quiet tones. ‘It’s about trying to get to something. The physical act is a metaphor of trying to access something that is frozen. Something between who you were and since the depression who you’ve moved to and there’s this thick layer of ice and you can’t get to yourself. You’re really excavating to try and find yourself again. It’s a positive act even though people around you find it horrible, self-destructive, terrifying and think that you have literally gone crazy.'"   -"A Head Full of Blue," Nick Johnstone    "If being sane is thinking there's something wrong with being different... I'd rather be completely fucking mental."   -Angelina Jolie
