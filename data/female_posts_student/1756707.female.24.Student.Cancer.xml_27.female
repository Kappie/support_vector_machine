There are many things I like about the lab: the space it affords me (it's big, with big windows, and I can work on a board or with a screen or at tables, etc.) I can also teach web design, and if I want my students to do this, they have to learn, and can't do that at home. But I certainly don't think computers make my class more democratic or solve any problems. They bring up new ones. I decided to teach in the lab cause it was available, and I really like it. But I'm certain it constrains me in ways that are invisible, that I might see more in another space. They certainly can be distracting, but I have the conference table space, although it is small. Well, on and on from here. I don't think either way is right or wrong. I don't think you and Jody have to do it a particular way to be right. I think it depends on what works for you. I like it that Jody thinks you can teach this stuff in many different ways. I think I can teach work and choices in the lab, and I want to try it next year. But it might constrain my students to only work in computer mediums. I guess we'll see... Wow, this was too long. Sorry.
