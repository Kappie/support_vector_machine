That really upsets me.  Not only is exploding dog REALLY MAD artwork, it has a pretty cool name, too.  And scary go round (which I have regrettably not read in a while) is just... cool.  And funny.  So, cool and funny, yes.  There ought to be an adjective to encompass all of that mad doom.  If there is, let me in on the know.  Tell me baby girl, cuz I need to know (I need to know).  NOOOOOO!!!  Isn't that Marc Antony?  What the HELL is he doing in my head?  WEll, whatever the reason, he needs to get out NOW becuase Weezer wants in there instead.  SPEAKING of Weezer, I was happily downloading all sorts of cool new things, and I found this GREAT NEW SONG--- Crap. Gotta go.
