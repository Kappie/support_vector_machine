You're warm eyes, your laugh, the sincere way you speak, and the kindness you showed me all became a part of my life.   It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted now I'm living without. It must have been love but I lost it somehow. From the moment we touch til the time runs out. Its where the water flow. Its where the wind blow. It must have been love but its over now.    I realized now that I had never known what it meant to be loved until I was loved by you. There are some days that I guess I never know when you love someone you gotta learn to let them go. There are things left unsaid and done. I'm letting go and you should too.
