So now we can get on with the business of all the other big summer blockbusters, because really, "The Day After Tomorrow" doesn't serve many other purposes.  Don't get me wrong, its special effects are incredible and the movie does its job of providing a 2-hour eye-candy-fest perfectly.  But I couldn't help thinking, watching six tornadoes sweep through and demolish Los Angeles with stunning detail, "Someone get Helen Hunt on the phone!"  But it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours on an empty, lazy day during an empty lazy weekend.  The only thing on the agenda for the rest of the night is some hard-core futon time with a young wizard.  Yay.    But first, a story...  H'ok so, the whole "gay subject" has always been a delicate one with the parents.  It was the first issue that created a rift between them and me, even in the days before I knew about myself.  They didn't think themselves homophobic; they just preferred it if gay folks just stayed "over there" and kept quiet about the whole thing.  And really, that's where they remain on the subject, even knowing about me.  It's not that surprising, and they've been much better about it than so many other parents in the world.    But any conversations about my sexuality have been very touch and go, very few and far between.  The last talk my dad and I had about it came a month after I came out to them in October of 1999 and ended with slamming doors.    Finally had to quell their last hope that I would one day embrace my feelings for Levi for what they clearly were and get over this whole gay thing last summer by letting them know that not only was my best friend and their best chance for a son-in-law gay, but it looked like it was going to stay that way for me, too.  Mom and I managed to have our first conversation about the whole thing since the outing and it appeared that some progress had been made during the years in between.  She still couldn't say the word, but at least she didn't cry.    And so, there've been baby steps for months.  Talking about my new law school friends, sometimes it had to be addressed.    "So, is Susan married?"  "Umm, no...."   Let it go, Mom, I'm not in the mood to go there.    "Divorced?"  "Noooo..."   Alright, I guess we're going there.     Pause.  "There  is  a third option." I said with a laugh.  "I knowww..." she replied with a long sigh, but managed to change the subject without this disclosure ruining the entire conversation.    Then came the Christmas holiday during which The Boy made an extended stay at the Mountain Fortress.  We toned it down a bit, but there were times our banter strayed into the area marked by rainbow flags.  And shockingly enough, the world didn't end.  Mom would usually either ignore us or mutter something about how she didn't want to hear about it, all the while keeping one ear on the conversation.    During the slow evolution and turnings of small corners, I've been content to be patient and steer clear from that topic of conversation.  They've been able to put the information in another place and not let it change how they are toward me, how they feel about me, and for that I'm grateful.  Meanwhile, I'm sure they've been dealing with it in their own ways and I've had no cause to disrupt their process.    Until I met someone, that is.    Hadn't mentioned anything about Miss Vicious in the last two weeks, despite the routine questions of "How was Bozeman?", "How's the week been going?", etc. and before long, it felt as though I was keeping something hidden.  It's a familiar feeling, and one I have no desire to relive.  And so, I decided to tell Mom about her when she made her weekly check-in call.    There weren't any opportunities to bring up the subject by the time we'd exhausted all the other topics, and when Mom asked "You wanna talk to Dad?" I thought about just saying yes and waiting until next time.    Instead, I said "Actually, I need to talk to you about something."  She let out one of her signature sighs, telling me she had an idea of where this talk was headed and was none too happy about it.    "I will tell you as much or as little as you want, but I just think you should know...I've met someone."  (Insert brief recounting of the Boy's matchmaking here.)  "You're just hell-bent on this, aren't you?" she asked, probably through a bit of tears, wishing I would surprise her.  "I'm not hell-bent on anything, Mom, this is just the way it is."   "So," she said, trying to keep her bearings, "what do you think?"  "I want to see where it's going.  We're not talking about moving in together, and we don't really know what's going to happen with her there and me here, but we both want to see where it's going to lead."  "And this is the first time you've had these romantic feelings for someone..." she started.  "Well, not the first time, but it's the first time it's happened this way.  I've felt like I've been keeping something from you by not saying anything and I don't want to do that."  "Well, I'm glad you said something.  I always figured you would if you needed to talk.  What's her name?...."  The conversation about Vicious herself didn't last very long, and it quickly became what I knew it would be when I brought it up, another turning point.  "So how are you doing with..." She still can't say the word.  "With what?"  "You know...with all this stuff."  "I'm fine, Mom.  Really.  I have been for a long time."  "Good, I'm glad."  "And really, you guys can always ask or talk to me about anything you want to..."  "Oh, I don't think we'll be doing that, dear."  She said with a laugh that was part nerves, part painful and no parts humor.  "I don't mean about this in particular, I mean about in general.  It's been in the news a lot recently, and I just thought I could be a good resource if you wanted to talk about anything."  "I don't think we'll be the ones to bring it up, dear; we're just going to have to deal with it.  I know it's not going to change, and it makes me feel bad."  "Why?"  "Because...you know...you won't have kids..."  "Mom, I plan on having kids, they're part of the long-term plan."  "Are you sure you want to do...that...with a kid?  I mean, I know you think it's so mainstream now, but it really isn't."  I put the sting from her question away for a minute so I could answer the question honestly, hopefully keeping this conversation an open exchange of information.  "It's something I know I'll think about seriously in another 10 years, when I have someone I want to be with forever and we both decide we want them.  But I don't think 'Oh shit, there goes kids.'"  "I know," she said, "it's just that it's so hard and always will be.  I guess you can decide where you live and that could make it easier...Maybe you and Levi could have kids together."  "Well, he is on the top of the sperm donor list."  So, she wasn't talking about "being gay" not being the right thing to do with a kid, she was worried about the surrounding atmosphere.  Part of me smiled at that realization.   "And it IS everywhere now," she continued.  "The hardest thing for me is how it becomes so wrapped up in who the person is, and it shouldn't.  I hate that that's who Rosie and Ellen are now.  It's not who the person is and I hate that it's such a big deal.  I just want it to be something that doesn't have to be announced, that it's just something about a person and it's not a big deal."  "Well, that's what a lot of people want too, but in order to get to that place, we have to go through this place where it is a big deal."  "I guess," she said, sounding resigned and I sensed an opportunity to actually share my feelings in a way I hadn't before.  "I can't get inside those people's heads who come out and then are forever labeled as the 'gay-this', but I imagine some of them wouldn't want to be attributed that any more than you want to hear it.  It's something that happens to them after they've come out, over which I imagine they have little control.  And really, I think a lot of gay people want to get to that place, too, where it isn't a big deal, it's just something you hear about and go on.  But if it really is to be not a big deal and something that just happens to be part of who someone is, then we ought to be able to have the same opportunities and same rights as everyone else.  When things get closer to equal, it may not be such a big deal.  But as long as there's a difference, it's going to be a big deal."  "Is this what you're going to do with your law degree?" she asked with another nervous laugh.     The conversation eventually, and comfortably, moved to other things.  But it's stayed in my mind for much of the day, as I'm sure it has for her, as well.  They're getting easier, these talks; maybe one day she'll have what she wants: the ability to know about it and move on.
