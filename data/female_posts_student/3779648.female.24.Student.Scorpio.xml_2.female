Now, im wondering how many people were thinking that same thing.  Surprisingly enough i wasnt!  Condsidering im a perverted nympho myself thats quite shocking..lol.  Anyway, the results are in!!!  I do in fact have a herniated disc.  We all suspected that but now its proven through the great technology of an MRI:)  Also, for those of you that dont know.. i also have a curvature of the spine (aka scoliosis) and some other medical mumbo gumbo..  the doc says i need to do 6 weeks of phyisical therapy and if that doesnt work then MAYBE try a pain clinic and/or surgery.  No surgen will touch me without doing the physical therapy first though.. which is fine with me!  I dont want surgery unless it is absolutely needed but unfortunately my doctor does think it will come to that.  Honestly, i do too just because of my own "research" on it all.  So, im still waiting to hear from medicaid and then i cant get things done.. until then, just more waiting:(  as if it hasnt been long enough!  I cant wait till the day i can walk again and live a normal life.  For those of you who might not know.. my back is fucked up.  And has been for 7 months now.. i live on pain meds and anti-inflamatories and havent worked in over three months.  It all sucks ass but im hanging in there.  I'm so happy and grateful to all of my family and friends that have been there for me.  Which leads me to thinking about all the friends i have lost in the process..  Its really quite amazing to me when i think of it.  Mostly because i thought of them as "real friends".  Im not really sure of the reason exactally that i have lost my friends but it all happened when things went downhill with my back.  I think its because they were either embarrassed to be around me or they didnt want to invite me to do things because they knew i couldnt physically or financially do it.  In turn, causing me to be upset or resentful for them not wanting to spend time with me.  Although i try not to think about the fact that i have lost so many good friends it still reflects on who i am i think.  But like i said.. im so grateful for my family (especially my sister erin) for being there for me.  And i do have a pretty great boyfriend too, who is very caring:)  So that always helps!  One more thing on the whole "friends" thing.. it is so amazing but unfortunate at the same time that i have the best friends in the world, but they happen to live thousands of miles away.  I know in my heart i will see them again though.. soon.  No matter what problem i have in my life nothing can ever stop that.  I have said so much and still my head is overloaded with random thoughts.. thank God for Metallica!  I miss my ex boyfriend Doug sometimes.. and my cousin Cory even more (especailly when i hear great music like this).  I cry when i watch cheerleading on tv and i had a dream of my ex Ryan Pline last night.. Colby Bryant was there too but its not what you think:)  I wish my boyfriend lived closer and my new hair is awesome!  thanks erin:)  TO HELENA (my so cute swedish friend:)): i miss you girl!  I'm SO happy you read this.. i didnt know if you still even had that email or not!  And i would do anything right now to be back in Germany drinking a beer with you and all our old friends!  And holding your ass up trying to dance with your long skirt on too.. lol.  ben status: non existant hair status:  really good:)
