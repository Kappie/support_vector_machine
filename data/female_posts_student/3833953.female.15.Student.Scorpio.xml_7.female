Last night was quite fun. We all had fun together and my friend Tia even came over and spent the night here. We had fun hanging out, and setting off fire works of various assorts. Most people who look at me probably dont know that i have a new love of having something in my hand on fire and about to explode or spin around in an array of color (jumping jacks ect..)...before the 3rd i had only once held one on fire to throw it and i was not very used to it, never had something in my hand that could possibly blow up in it before. that was about 2 or 3 years ago...well on the night of my last blog entry (the 3rd) i got to do some of my first fire works lighting. it was very very very awesome feeling once you got used to it. last night i didnt do quite as much, but i still did. My friend wasnt feeling well, so she mainly sat around the whole time...im sure she eventually felt better because we were hanging out later, and she wasnt near as pale and sad looking...My sibblings and buddies were outside for the majority of the early morning...somewhere around 3 they came in, drunk as hell from playing a drinking game. this morning you can deffinataly tell who had it worst. I just hope they all wake up..so far most everyones up, except for my brothers. unless they are up and i dont know...i just hope they are ok. As far as my friend and I, were confined to the house inside and not alowed to even watch them, because of our under-agednessd...(is that a word? :p)its was still fun to watch them periodically come in with a buzz and act funny. even though my siblings and co came in first, Tia and I where the last ones asleep..and i was the last one period. i went to bed at 4 or so.   besides that, today has just begun for me. i got up, my friend was still sleeping, so i got up and let her sleep and went on here to update...what fun. and look! i have a whoping 12 hours left of my 24 hour day. 12 of them are already past! 4 of which i was awake in the early morning, 6 1/2 of which i have slept, and 1 1/2 of which i have been up from sleeping..and now its noon..thus 12 hours left of my day. what to do what to do?... :) :p   well, im going too be on my way. im hoping my next update wont be like a month later..but hey, alwell.   cya! -"Phoenix"
