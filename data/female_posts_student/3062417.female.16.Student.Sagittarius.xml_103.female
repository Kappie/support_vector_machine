If anyone wants to do anything later (after 6ish) then give me a call cause I'm just going to be really bored all day.   I was thinking evil thoughts and wishing the power would go out so badly last night. It would have been awesome.  Well, right now I'm talking to Dan and listening to Less Than Jake.   Listening to: [The Science Of Selling Yourself Short by Less Than Jake]  I've come to my senses, That I've become senseless, I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships, Every last conviction, I smoked them all away, I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way,  So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?"  Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems,  [Chorus:] I'll sing along, Yeah with every emergency, Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophies, I'm so far gone, That deep down inside I think it's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy  I could be an expert on co-dependency, I could write the best book on underage tragedy, I've been spending my time at the local liquor store, I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor,  So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?"  I'm so over-dosed on apathy and burnt out on sympathy.  [Chorus]   Let the meaning slip away Lost my faith in another day, Self deprication seems okay, I never thought I'd make it anyway   [Chorus]   I'm my own worst enemy  [x5]
