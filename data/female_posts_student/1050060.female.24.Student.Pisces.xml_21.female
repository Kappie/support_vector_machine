I needed to pay for school and give my parents the money I loaned from them. But all is good. I had an amazing weekend. I got to spend time with my brother and my parents. I had the most amazing talks with them.   I feel that everyone is part of the family again. I think I need to talk because we didn't do it enough while my mom was sick. I started opening the communication up with them. I feel that we are a family again. I did learn things about my brother and it kind of shocked me but that's ok. I also learned that my brother is going through some of the things I did went through as a teen. I really made great contact with my brother. To get going. I need to read some chapters in my death and dying book. Oh that didn't sound right. LOL. Anyways have a good day and night.
