Beauty is something we all want, don't you want to look beautiful? Don't you want to act beautiful, to sound beautiful - to simply be beautiful? but there is good news out there for those of us who maybe don't seem to have it all - that is where "the beholder" comes in. God - he is our beholder at all times. No matter how he looks at you, from whatever angle - he thinks that you are beautiful. He thinks that everything about you is beautiful, he created you - so he knows you in an intimate way. Intimacy. He loves me even when he knows the bad stuff? He thinks that I'm beautiful even when in the intimacy of our relationship he sees all the things that I've done? just something to think about whenever you feel like you're not beautiful. those days where you look in the mirror and just want to crawl into a corner. He thinks you are beautiful . . .
