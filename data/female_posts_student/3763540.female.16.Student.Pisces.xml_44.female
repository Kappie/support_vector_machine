I then woke up in a ocd cleaning mood and so this afternoon i cleaned really good but that was because it is part of the get on moms good side  so i can do stuff this weekend without grief plan. School was just kinda school i zoned out a good deal, conjegated some verbos en espanol and finished my anatomy homework in band and almost killed patrick and robby...all in a days work really....i feel like im having to raise two 3 year olds who have never been spanked in their lives...  This afternoon went very fast actually and I cleaned like an ocd madwoman and was very sociable and nice to mom( very important to do since i got no sleep this weekend to show i can still be in a good mood)...im so brilliant! id better not gloat untill after it works ok so on with it. i had me some chicken salad  just makes me happy but then i watched Everybody Loves Raymond! that show makes me laugh i love Marie and Frank they freakishly remind me of myself....so mean and yet they still love each other crazy.... ok so i lost my thoughts...i guess ill end now! today was a good day  oh ok so first of all things i have learned today: 1. it takes 3 shots to kill a possum 2. There are mountain Lions in Alabama 3. I am a funny child 4. I am actually a useful girlfriend  ok so i dont know why i did that but it was kinda neat so now the thing that made me laugh the most:  Frank: "Cant you ever just shut your mouth?" Marie: "Why I have a mind of my own...i contribute.....I'm not like one of those...Trophy Wives!" Frank: "Trophy Wife?!" "What contest in hell did I win?!"  Have a good night kids!
