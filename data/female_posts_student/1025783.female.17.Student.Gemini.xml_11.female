We sat there in that cold, cold room just listening for a while, as it began to drive us all quietly mad. I looked over to see my father rocking back and forth on the rug. His eyes were glazed and he kept humming soft lullabies. "Pappa?" I called timidly? He looked at me, eyes darting and crazy.

A thin whisper shook through me, knowing that I shouldn't look, but my mind got the better of me. My head turned slowly, eyes wide in anticipation. We had placed wood in front of the window, and as I turned I noticed it was stripped clean.  Lily stood rigid and placid, grinning from ear to ear just staring at us all. A shrill scream filled the room and I realized it was coming from my own throat. Lily's face changed, she grew angry and berserk. Clawing at her hair and eyes, her long sharp nails grew streams of blood from her molding cheeks. She pounded at the windows, and just as they seemed they were going to break she fell. It was too dark to see what had happened, but I heard the bat crack in half just as Lily's insane laughter mixed with the dying cries of my father.   *To be Continued*
