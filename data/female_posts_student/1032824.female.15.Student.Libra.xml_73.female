After being the focus of attention for practically the entire tournament, Wilkinson â€“ under extreme pressure -- slotted the decider to secure the Webb-Ellis Cup for the Martin Johnson-led English. It followed a titanic fight-back from the Wallabies who went close to becoming the first team to defend a Rugby World Cup title and the first to come back after trailing at the half in a Final. England led 14-5 at the break after tries to Lote Tuquiri for Australia and Jason Robinson for England. The scores had been locked at  14-14 at full-time , after  Elton Flatley  kicked a dramatic last-minute penalty to draw Australia level. Flatley had earlier kicked two second-half penalties to close gap to three points. England led 17-14 after Wilkinson's fourth penalty early in the first period of extra time. But Flatley replied with another last-gasp penalty to level the scores again at 20-20 before Wilkinson clinched the decider in the last minute of extra-time. It was only the second time a RWC Final had gone to extra-time, securing  England's first every championship , and the first for northern hemisphere teams in Rugby World Cups. Australia's epic performance was also widely acknowledged, despite being the Wallabies' first ever loss in a Final.
