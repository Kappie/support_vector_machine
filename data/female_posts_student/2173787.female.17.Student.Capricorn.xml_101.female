Described there on the pages of the book was my "mood", something that I have never been able to put into words.  So to be a plagiarist, this is me and my mood:  "On rainy or melancholy days Edna went out and sought the society of the friends she had made at the Grand Isle.  Or else she stayed indoors and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own comfort and peace of mind.  It was not despair; but it seemed to her as if life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled.  Yet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by fresh promises which her youth held out to her."  and: "But as she sat there amid her guests, she felt the old ennui overtaking her; the hopelessness which so often assailed her, which came upon her like an obsession, like something extraneous, independent of volition.  It was something which announced itself; a chill breath that seemed to issue from some vast cavern wherein discords wailed.  There came over her the acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the presence of the beloved one, overpowering her at once with a sense of the unattainable."  The second paragraph explains me exactly as I sat upon the futon at Diana's party, the difference, Edna knew the identity of the unattainable and I do not.  It is somewhat gratifying that here, within a (fairly) well known piece of Literature someone else feels as I feel.  It brings hope to realize that one is not alone, that others, too, have passed through such phases.  Such things are necessary to my sanity.
