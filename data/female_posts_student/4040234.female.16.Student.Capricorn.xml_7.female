I love CARMEN my bff, soo much.. She is soo real and she doesnt hide it. If she has something to say, she's going say it. she's gonna scream it. lol... and even after being loud and straight forward she still has friends. omg it amazing... Most ppl now are like, if i say that they wont like me. Oh well, fuck them. Nobody's perfect, and everyone should realize that. Stop judging ppl and just accept who they are. More ppl will like you if you do this!!! Work sucks. The paycheck is niice, but getting up and serving ppl is just not cool. I'm so tired of using my 'sweet' voice and acting like i care. " Aww do u want lettuce on that... ok... tomatoes, mayo, anything else... can i lick your toes and clean your ass while I'm at it?" That's what i feel like. lol I'm going to Sandcastle tom.
