I mean just coz u cover up ure old image of being ureself and what u were doesnt mean its making ure life any better. I mean u may be mr./mizz popular, u may have more "friends" but ure head is fucked in its own way. Whats the point of being what ure not? Yea coz being someone totally new image and leaving ure old friends behind will sure help u. When something ever happens don't come running bak to those who were real run to those who are fake and watch ure self get burned. I mite have changed goin into high skool but i sure as hell hope not coz i dont wanna be a bitch like those who hold fake images. I dont wanna be fake and i dont wanna live under a new image, i dont wanna have plenty of fake friends or live a fake life. So if any of the above apply to u u mite wanna reconsider or dont.. for all i care.. just dont be a bitch towards me
