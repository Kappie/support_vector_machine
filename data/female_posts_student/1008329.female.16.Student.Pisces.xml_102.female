I can never see.      Today  I saw purely though. I saw inside of you. I saw the true you. I  don't  like you. I use to but you've changed. You're  completely  not the same.  I shouldn't have pushed it. But that's what I do.  I push.          And Push.                       And Push.  Until you go away. Then I say, "Well I guess you never liked      I  love  how you lie to me. Makes me feel good inside. I soak up your lies + believe them as truths. Lies are sometimes better than reality. Lie to me, becos I'll believe you. I  want  to believe you.  But the little things don't matter as much anymore...  I'm over it.  But then again I'm not. I'm just numb to everything  again .   I'm in my own world  again .  It's in my head. A deep stage of denial. It makes me strong.   Becos I escape you, he, she, it, them, us. Gone.  I love it.   ...Hey  boy , take a  look  at  me  Let me  dirty   up  your mind...      Today you saw me. And you were scared. You knew I saw through you. You knew I didn't care. I love how you're completely not what I want. I love how you completely are. I love how I like you completely. I love how you complete me.     Isn't it queer when you think you know someone so much but it turns out you really don't? I love being dissapointed, don't you? Don't you love feeling like the world is coming unglued? Don't you love staying up all night becos you're manic moods won't let you sleep? Don't you love sleeping all day becos thoughts are too much to think?  Don't you love it?   Don't   you   love  it? Don't you? You've gotta love it. Becos you do it to yourself  over  and  over  again.  Stupid girl.  Elyse   I can't move on. But I can't take it. I want to move on. But I can't fake it.
