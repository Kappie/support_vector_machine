Chorus: But sometimes it’s hard to breathe And I don’t remember how to live And I’m scared I never will And I won’t write songs about the rain And I won’t be obvious about my pain So don’t look too closely And let me lay broken.  Verse 2: And I don’t want to go away And staying isn’t something I do well I just feel so let down No one here to pick me up I can’t get my feet  Underneath me, on solid ground I can’t make through another day  Chorus  Bridge And if I fell too far Could I find my way back? And if I cry out loud Would you know I was sad? Would you notice at all?  Verse 3: Please don’t get me wrong I get through this somehow, somewhere I always seem to But it just gets harder every day Make it all go away Break me, bend me, I’m broken I can make it through another day
