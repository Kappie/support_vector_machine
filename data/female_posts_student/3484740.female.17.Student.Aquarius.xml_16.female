As of right now...a plan of mine is to be going to Texas next Monday for a few days. Stay with Dawn for a night maybe, see a bunch of people, get some new school clothes. I'm excited.  Work is alright for right now. The other day these drunk people came, and we really can't do anything about drunk people, just have to let them in ya know. So they went in and well their little boy that was almost 2, was playing with the gate, and I very nicely went and held the gate shut and told him he needed to go to his mother and she basically looked at me like how dare I do that. Then the dad was like why are you being hateful to him. I don't see how I was being hateful, I simply told him he couldn't play with the stupid gate. When they left they called me an ass hole, and a lady on the board stood up and asked what was wrong. And then there was a meeting the same night, and they came back, still drunk and was crapping about me, but they kinda brushed it off because a lady and her husband on the board were sitting right there, and they said I kicked them out, well trust me, they left very willingly. Hehe, I'm just glad people were sitting there!   I'm not sure what else is going on, nothing I can really think of I don't guess. Maybe I'll be hearing from someone one of these days, if not, I guess thats okay too. We'll just have to wait and see.
