Or as fine as it gets when you've got parents like ours. Anyways, got home and found my mum very very sick. Apparently she did bad in her medical exams and so she had instant fever. So yeah. Had to stay at home for some reason because she was sick although didnt do anything except for furiously type. Another time then, S.Today am supposed to go out but my hair's stupid and am severely poor.  When shall this poordom pass?
