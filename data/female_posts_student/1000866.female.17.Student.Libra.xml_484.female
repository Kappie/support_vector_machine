Only one more full day of school this week. :) I actually may not go to jazz tomorrow. I've got way way way too much to do before Thursday. I have to be all packed before I go to school Thursday since I'm going for half the day, then I'm going home and I have to be pretty much ready.   We have to leave for the airport kind of early since it's an international flight but it's ok. Now that my mom travels so much for business, she's part of the Admiral's Club and they have internet access and such. Whoo. Maybe I'll write in here while I'm waiting for my plane.   Anyway, today was pretty good. Wind Ensemble...hmm...We just played Kavorkna fanfare which is pretty cool except...I can't double tongue so I guess it's not really cool. We also got the Night Before Christmas which I'm really excited about! We recorded it for the narrator to practice with too except...the recording SUCKS haha. I was so surprised when he's like, "ok, we're recording now." Yeah...that was interesting. Tomorrow, I guess some guy is coming in to conduct us. Ummm...YaY?  Math was ok. We had a quiz. I didn't really know what I was doing but that's ok. I never know what I'm doing in that class and somehow I've managed to keep an A.   Gym was ok. We finished up doing the floor stuff today. I'm scared to do the apparatus stuff. I'll probably kill myself on the bars and I'm just too scared to even try going on the balance beam.   French was ok. (I guess everything was, "ok" today.) Pretty boring. It's so incredibly facile. Lunch...eh. I just typed my thing for Satire and Comedy that she gave me an extra day on because I honestly forgot all about it this weekend with everything that happened. She's so funny. I love her.  History was uninteresting as usual and Satire and Comedy was pretty fun. I love that class actually. I love my class and Ms. Gatto's so nice. We go off on so many tangents too. Ah, fun fun times.   And jazz wasn't bad at all. The only thing we worked on was Jalapeno Dreams which, i actually like so...it was fun. Tom's even been tolerable lately.   Someone's really getting to me though. Like...REALLY getting to me. Like..."Good God, please shut up. your interminable cynicism is old." I'm not puting her name on here seeing as people actually do read this thing. (I'm really not sure WHY but that's a whole different topic.) She just has to be so cantankerous and for lack of a better word (aka, I didn't want to think of a word that I didn't make up) complaintive. I think complaintive ought to be a word. I'd use it if it were a word. Then again, I use it when it's not a word so I suppose it doesn't matter either way. But yes...I know I'm being, "complaintive," right now but she's complaintive about everything. "The floor is sticky." "I don't want to stand" "Why are you reading instead of talking to me??"   Ughhh, why do you think?!?! You're a bright child. You figure it out.   OK, I'm done with my, "incessant ranting" for the evening. OK, maybe not but at least on that topic I am. I may come back to that in the future though.   I finished Gatsby. He was murdered. Shock shock. You can't imagine the look of dismay upon my face right now or the joy I get out of being sarcastic online when no one understands...  Hehe. "Baby Got Back" just randomly started playing from my music list. Kind of funny. It's really sad I know all these words...  "...yeah baby. when it comes to females. Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection..."  OK, maybe I'll go call Bryan since he NEVER calls me. Haha. Really...it doesn't bother me at all. My own boyfriend...never calls. It's ok...really. It's just fine. Haha, actually...I really don't mind. I just want to make him feel bad.  I'm in a really good mood right now. Plus...I have food. Yum. J'aime Manger!
