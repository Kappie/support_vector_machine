Well it's 11:20 p.m., so it's not like i could if I tried, dare to dream. Anyway, my mom is starting to bug the hell outta me (love her as much as I do, but the woman really is crazy!). Today she kept nagging me about "keeping the house tidy" and all that shit. Now you guys may not think that sounds bad, but you obiviously don't no my mom (you lucky bastards).  I think it's time i introduce ya'll to the half of my parents who's responsible for my birth, and loss of sanity   My Mom Aka The Dirt Nazi Characteristics: my mom can be funny sometimes, but other times she’s just a pain in the ass. She likes to sing (though she sounds like a monkey on acid), dance, and have a good time, but she tries to hard. She is a generally good person, but I think she saves her rage for me (what an honor). She is the complete opposite of my dad and I sometimes wonder why they are still together. She is a clean freak and expects everything to be “spick and span”.  If someone doesn’t put their dirty shirt into the laundry after they’ve taken a bath, it’s like committing a sin to her. I think there might be a bible out there called “The Holy Book of House Cleaning”, cause she must be a “Cleanist” or “Neat Freakist” if so I’m definitely not converting, I’m perfectly fine with practicing the rituals of Slacker-ism. Apart from being a neat freak, my mom is overly emotional. Well maybe that’s exaggerating a bit, but she can definitely cry up a storm and flood the streets if she’s having a “moment”. I have to admit though, I am a bit emotional myself, it’s probably biological, damn you mom!  I guess if I look pass her insane cleaning antics and “pass me the Kleenex” episodes my mom is a pretty cool chick, *thinks for a moment* nope she's still a crazy nazi.
