I broke up with Chris and got back together with him in the matter of 24 hours, all because of an ultimatum made by Mike. "We're either all or nothing." and I panicked. So i broke up with him. And I thought that i should have some time to think about things before i started another relationship, but that didn't make Mike too happy. And that royally pissed me off. I thought I deserved to think about what I wanted to do in this situation, but apparently I was supposed to know right away. So I got back together with Chris, because he and I talked about things. On top of that, this guy I met down in Mexico seemed amazing and sweet, so I was trying to not think like that about him. But when he found out that I was back with Chris, he just sulked and put me ona major guilt trip. See ya, Jamie. So then i go over to Mike's to give him back some of his shit, and he has, one of my Cd's. Currently, Glassjaw is NOT in my Possession. Continuing on. Bri surprised me by being home early which was wonderful, lemme tell ya. But lately, she's been being dramatic, and bitchy towards me. I can tell that we're making eachother tense, but eh. We both have a lot on our minds.  Then I'm working at Maurices, the sidewalk sale..........GEOFF. comes up to me, out of fucking nowhere. I didn't think that my chain of guys would have involved him. It freaked me the fuck out. It made me happy and extremely furious at thesame time. eep. So we made plans to talk and have breakfast the following week, but surprise surprise, he canceled whatever, it bothered me that he canceled and at the same time, I didn't give a shit. Speaking of, he talked to me online wasted, that was interesting. And then Jake and Wayne, Jake. oh goodness, hitting on me hardcore, while he has a girlfriend that I go to school with, and then every fucking guy telling me that "Oh, if you weren't so hot, I wouldn't like you." apparently, my personality is vapid and shallow. I know guysthink that's a compliment, but no, it's not when that's all you heard from Geoff for a year and a half, then telling me I don't have a personality whatsoever. GAH. and Mike, I can't even begin to say how much I'm hurting, because we can't talk. I'm so sorry Mike. Everyday seems to just get fucking worse. I drove to Mike's yesterday, and the drive there, I was behind a Mack truck and I was thinking how easy it would be to drive into the back of it.............
