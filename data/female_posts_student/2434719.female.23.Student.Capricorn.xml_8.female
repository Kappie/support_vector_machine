(FOREVER.) and that's what i've done today. doesn't it seem like nothing? i need to stop playing around and really get to work. no excuses!  it makes me happy that inspire newman to write in her blog. hers are so much better than mine too......"i'm going to cure cancer. i have big biceps." i want to be a fighting doctor too! okay no i don't. but still it's cool she does that stuff.    LIVING IN A CITY ALL ALONE.  PROS: i love that i can do the stupid things that i think make differences without getting made fun of.... i can eat the things i want (i know that sounds odd). i can do what i want when i want... i can really focus on school... i know what i want, in every aspect of my life wihtout being influenced by others... CONS: i really miss you.  this is starting to get to me, and i'm tired of every single night coming home to nothing... and eating every single meal alone... and not having someone around to make me lose focus for just a few minutes to have fun.   i just miss having people around who convinced me to eat something crazy like cake for dinner, or will come over and overstay thier welcome until past my bedtime, or who will make me stop studying to go do something random and fun.  oh geeze this is crazy. i'm never like this!  i'm starting to see why people stick around. :)    i love going to this coffee place to study... and you know how i thikn nobody ever remembers me? i was so happy when the guy who works there knew what i wanted today. and they play ryan adams... how great is that? today they played the love is hell part two cd... i'm actually listening to ryan adams right now which is just a coincidence.   or was that why i thought of talking about it?  NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW!  i'm excited about the summer. i'm excited about campouts on the beach. i'm excited about drinking sunkist with danny and not working about the calories. i'm excited about playing with my dog everyday (she cried when i left!) i'm excited about helping kristin get ready to move into her new place. i'm excited to explore downtown with newman. i'm excited to write my greatest novel at herman park (that's for you!). i'm excited to eat my meals at the table again. i'm excited about early morning swims in my pool, dodging the spiders. i'm excited about the sunshine...  i'm excited to finish reading all these great books. i'm excited about always having fresh fruit waiting for me to eat. i'm excited about my mom's flowers blooming. i'm excited about my induction into the ya-ya-spice-club (don't ask).  so many things to look forward too.  i have nothing to complain about. :)
