about like i dunno 5 ish and my dad walks in and tells me he is bringing my mom to the hospital ... i thought it was a dream but theni actually got up and my mom was gone i was like shit lol ... and i took a shower and woke aija up and was like damn my mom is in the hospital and she was like shit... in here half awake morning breath voice ...   so anyways we bounced from there to her house so we could eventually meet up with 'the guys' we got ready and wore our hott new outfits and aija did my hair all hott and we were so banging and i was like wow i dont even wanna stopp looking atmyself ... well not really but i can pretend lol ... so yea we waited and stuff but i talked to garrett on the phone for like a half hour and we decided that he was gonna wait for chad and leave with him so they could do watever ... so yea chad gets outta work at 1 ... and me and aija placed bets on what time they would come and i totally won lol they didn come until like 250 so we chilled until garrett had to leave at like i duno 415 which was cool i like hanging out with him but he was all tired from his adventure with chad which wasnt cool ...   so then it was just me aija and chad and we played tarot cards and like i guess bad shit is gonna happen ... teh nothing new i suppose ... and we fucked up chads cards so his was all like death and stuff lol and then we sat out and watched some of shainghi knights or watever then we left the house at like i udnno 530 so we left to go to the beach but chad totally wasnt havin it so he just went home to go and "sleep" teh watever lol uhh so we left to the beach and forgot you need money to get and see the shitty fireworks ... so we had to get a ride back with aijs cousin chase ... and we didnt get one back which was geyyy lol so we like chilled there and met up with like a shit load of people and like jen dexter is due next tuesday and we saw jeanna and she is already showing ... i dunno it was weird ... so whatever like i dunno wha else happened it must not have been important so then like i dunno jamie like ditched us or watever i dunno and we ended up watching fireworks with will but not all of then cuz like we spent half the time looking for aijas dad anyways ...   the fireworks sucked  but watever so then we went to wills car cuz the fireworks were over and we were gonna be like insominiac and do all this crazy shit ... so we went to bickfords and got milkshakes and we saw cindy martin but it was good i have a coffee one and will took a pick of me with cream all up ons my facelol funnie shit lol so yea then like aija drove wills car aroudn the parking lot at bickfords and i was like i wanna drive so like we went the the parking lot at the mall (its like i dunno 11 at night) and like so aija just kept cliping of the imaginary cars teh but teh i can drive like thee best lol i was like flying towards poles and like turning at the last second i was going like all fast and stuff it was funie lol but now im all motivated to get my permit lol ... but watever umm so yea so will was like thats enough so will taught me how to drive ... cool cool ...   so then we went to price choppers and like o yea me and aija went shot for shot with sugar packets lol soo funnie so yea me and aija were all hype on sugar and lol will bought a camera and he had his phone and we took a pic of me with a dog leash on and a bone in my mouth (its had to of been quarter of midnight) ok so then like o yea a pic of me and aija molesting teddy bears lol ... and then aija climbed into on of the freezers in price chopper and we closed the door and took a pic of her lol it was so funnie so then we like ran outta there ... and were out side and will was like i wanna push somone in a carrage so i jumpedinto a shoping cart and will pushed me and like let me go and i was all (by aija):"pussy and scarreed, and i suck garretts balls and they taste really good..." like o man holy shit dont let me crash into the cart thingy so will stoped it and then like i was getting out and aija like grabed it and like shook it and i almost fell and will took a pic of that lol so like there was somone parked in the parking lot with their lights on so we like ran into the car well not will he walked he never runs lol so yea  then we went to nichols college and aija like tried to roll down the hill but it was too steep and like this security cop pulled up and like just sat there and will is like uhh aija i think you should get up and lets go so we  like pulled out and the cop followed us a little but like never asked wat we were doing it was wicked funnie   so then like i dunno we showed will hill street and we made him fly down the fucking hill and we like were off the ground and we like skidded out or watever it was wicked fun lol so
