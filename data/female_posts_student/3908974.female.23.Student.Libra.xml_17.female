But he does have to disappear from time to time to go dish out fried eggs and country ham.  So anyway, the dreaming.  Since I never sleep when he's around, I came home from work on Friday and slept for 17 hours straight.  I thought I was never going to wake up.  I had a nightmare about grass.  I was on the outskirts of my hometown at night, driving a broken El Camino the color of phlegm down some winding dirt road.  It died next to this ravine, and so I got out and I crawled through the grass.  The grass became thick, like hair, them it started pulling me toward the mouth of the ravine.  I couldn't move, I couldn't fight.  It ripped off my flip flops and wound around my wrists.  Then I was in the ravine, and all these vines and roots were piercing me and sucking away my blood.  I hung there, suspended, like a fly in a spider's web.    There was a lot of other stuff that night, but the other element that stands out the most is that Pancho Villa was there, and he was in a straightjacket.  The next day, I went camping and passed out with a ring of toasted marshmallow aroung my mouth and about a gallon of beer swishing around in my stomach.  I dreamed of my ex husband.  He approached me while I was walking on campus.  He was dressed like Johnny Cash, all black and Western.  Except he was wearing white canvas Converse shoes.  He handed me a book of poems.  He looked so old!  Last night was another gross managerie, but I don't recall all that much.  But I do have scratches all up and down my arms and on my feet, like I was ripping myself to shreds all night.  I dreamed I slit my wrist, and there were no veins in my arm, so the cut just hung open like a mouth.  I went to a restaurant in the boxcar of a train, and it was all tilted.  The menu was huge and I couldn't decide what to order.  I looked out the window, and there was this dark rainy parking lot, and a neon lit biker bar.  I saw my ex husband walking past.  We met eyes.  I ran away from the boxcar, down a hill, past a conglomoration of places I have lived--past frat houses, fountains, skyscrapers, playgrounds.      I have a feeling I am going to see him again.  I am really scared, because even though he's a cruel man and I know better, he has a grip on me like nobody else.  He will be home this summer, living with his mom.  And I will be here, a townie for life!  Last year around this time was the last time we hung out together.  He told me he loved me, then like a total pushover, I cried and slept with him.  Not my finest hour, but instead of continuing to berate myself for it, let me just say I loved him like nobody's business, and that was a hard time.
