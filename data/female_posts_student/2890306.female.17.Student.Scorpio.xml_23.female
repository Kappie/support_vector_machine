Play is now over, and the free time I possess is, quite frankly, overwhelming.  Who knew that I would again discover the definition of  bored ?  Not me, that's who.  It was a very good day.  Oh, and did I mention...no homework tonight either.  Things are swinging my way, I tell you what.  This morning started off with a bit of a jolt.  I can't seem to train my brain to wake up when it's supposed to.  I always think, "You have 5 more minutes to sleep before you  really  need to wake up, Katie" and by the time those "5 minutes" are up, the clock says I was supposed to be downstairs 10 minutes ago.  Oh well.  I am sure tomorrow A.M. will be different, for I am actually going to provide my body with the required hours of sleep tonight (i.e. more that 5).  I wonder how that will feel.  Now, I leave you with an exerpt from Shakespeare's  Macbeth , in honor of the Guthrie Trip next week.  (Though we're going to see  Romeo and Juliet , I decided upon this quote.  Chase, this one's for you...)  "Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw."
