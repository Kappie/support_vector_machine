We had marching yesterday. It was cool. We stayed inside the whole time, and I got to play second part, so the music part will be really easy. I left early from marching at around 5:00, then went out to dinner with my friends (I made the plans before I knew about marching). So, dinner was fun. It was Kelly's birthday, so it was cool. Then we went to Kel's for a sleepover, and did bunches of neat stuff, and I went to sleep earlier than usual for a sleepover since I had to be at a Bar Mitzvah this morning. It was pretty neat. I have to do this project for CR, and we have to go to two different places of worship than our own. So, one is obviously a Jewish synagogue, and I think I'm going to go to a mosque for my other one, but who knows...so, this has been my only chance to write, and I actually have to go now, so I'll write more later...maybe.  *Ya di amore*
