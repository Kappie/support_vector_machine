I reckon strip poker woulda been funnier, but the rules say the movie has to be PG or G rated (*stupid school rules*).  I just saw Charmed. CHRIS DIES? [:'(] ... he was cute even when he was dying, and baby Chris is cute too...actually, baby Wyatt is growing on me...he's adorable when he orbs.  Well, last week I discovered why Colin Firth is so handsome and this week, it's Ioan Gruffudd ... wow ... the cuteness when he smiles! Yes Natbat, I know you saw him first, and I know I caught onto Ioan craze a little later than everyone else (delayed reaction), but better late than never! And I watched him on Rove and didn't tape it! Anyone got a copy so I can watch with new admiration?  Alright, finally, we hav a filming date and it will begin on the 5th of August, between, 8:30 and 8:45 am (I can't guarantee that I am capable of getting to school at 8:30am). Fingers crossed it will work and no interruptions! Ooh, that reminds me, I still have to write a formal script of some kind ... well, to work then ...   Namárië
