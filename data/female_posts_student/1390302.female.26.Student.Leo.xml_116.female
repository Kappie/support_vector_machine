I have been trying to pack, especially now that it's  getting down to brass tacks, as they say.  No matter how much I pack, nothing seems to be getting done.  I wish I could say why, it's probably because we have so much stuff...yes, stuff, there's no other way to put it.  I never realized you could stuff and cram so many things into 580 square feet, but alas, I have been disallusioned!    So the boxes are stacking up, the pictures are coming down, and there's less than a week to go until moving day on July 9th.  The electricity in our new place is not going to be hooked up until the 8th, which makes me really glad I called today to have in connected.  There is aparently a three day wait, had I waited until Tuesday to call TXU, we would have been moving in with no air conditioning, and no lights.  No lights could be done, no electricity for A/C cannot be done.  Texas is hotter than hades in July, this July is no different from the rest, hot.  We get to go to Stephenville on Monday to sit while they spend six hours delivering, setting up, and tieing down the mobile home.  It's going to be hot and there is going to be no air, it's going to be a terrible day.  There is also no shade on the lot we rented, so sitting in the shade is a no go.  Then, we get to return on Tuesday to sit while they hook-up all of our things, electricity, plumbing, water, etc., and do the skirting.  Moving is going to kill me, really, it is.    My ulcer is killing me, theres 6 days until moving day, we have to spend 3 of them driving all over Texas, I have to do like 12 loads of laundry, clean the apartment before moving and I have no help with the packing.  I am not sure how I am going to pull this off, but I know I have to.  Wish me luck!  ~Kristyn
