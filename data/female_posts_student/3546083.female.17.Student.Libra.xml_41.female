(besides the dentist appointment *shiver*). i went 2 c the new king arthur movie with tony. it was pretty good. i kinda zoned out the last half hour tho lol. i was kinda tired. (yes tony, i know! lol). i didnt understand some of it tho. but neway, it was nothing like ne of the king arthur stories i have ever read. so yea, then after the movie tony came over and had dinner and we worked on the puzzle i got the other day when i was stranded at the mall with irina. then we went 2 dics 2 get me a new bike since im never gettin my other one back. so yea that was fun. i had a good time. definitely something i'd like 2 do again. i really like him. he's kinda shy tho. but then again, i shouldnt b talkin lol. but i can live with that. he bought me a necklace :-) i like it :-)  ... i also talked 2 kenny online. told him all about tony. he said he's happy 4 me. and he said if tony ever hurts me, he would beat him up. yea ok, tony prolly dwarfs him by like 2 feet lol. but i didnt tell him that. i just told him not 2 worry about me. then i was tryin 2 figure out wut i should wear, and i told kenny and he said i should wear wut i wore on r first date. i told him i couldnt remember, and he told me! i never thought he actually remembered! yea, then i made him mad... he mentioned that sarah winters was online and he should go and hack her computer. that made me mad cuz he was always talkin bout hacking computers and fighting and stuff when we were goin out then he admitted that he never did ne of that. if there's 1 thing i cant stand its a mucho-man facade. so i was like "stop pretending like u ever could or would do nething like that"... yea note 2 self: never insult a clinically depressed person. at first he got mad then he got really depressed and self-deprecating and started talkin bout how the whole world hates him. but i dont know wut 2 do about him nemore. i cant b talking him out of a suicide attempt every day... but neway, i gotsta get goin. got work in the morning. besides, tony is anxious 2 read this lol.
