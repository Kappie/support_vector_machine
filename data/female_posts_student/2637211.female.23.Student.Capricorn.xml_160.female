I'm seriously on the verge of tears about the whole thing. Luckily, she called me back tonight, so even though I was out, I know she's alive and I can still get ahold of her. Melissa suggested this may be an elaborate April Fool's joke, but I highly doubt that, since my parents are really disorganized, and too nice to pull that kind of shit. I'm sad though. It's just not right.
