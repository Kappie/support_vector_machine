I can't continue hurting him like i do.  when nate came over the other night we went on a really long walk around my neighborhood. He talked about his girlfriend, how it wasn't going anywhere, about us and how messed up it is that he would throw us away, and he talked about how depressed he is with his life. At the end of the night while we were sitting on my porch he said, "why do you have to be so beautiful?" and then he kissed me.   ...  Tim found out. Nate told Dan, dan told steffanie, steffanie told Tim. Tim freaked out a couple of nights ago when i was spending the night at Genies. It was nearly 2 in the morning when he called me crying and freaking out. bahhhh.  I need to talk to him. Now. He thinks we're going out. We're not. I need this to be done. I refuse to date in high school any longer. Its a waste of my emotions and time.   BAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
