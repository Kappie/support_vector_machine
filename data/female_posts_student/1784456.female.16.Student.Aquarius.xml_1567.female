Sounds revolting! *YAY* My rents have bought LOTR; Fellowship of the ring on video!! it was £5.99 in Safeways!!! It was cos we went shopping, i got a witches hat, flase nails, new coat, new school shoes, new book, headfones, wot else, i'm sure there was something but i can't for the life of me think what is was. O well, i got alot, and only spent £6 of my own money (Ihad £50).
