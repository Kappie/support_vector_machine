Tony went back to bed in Joey’s room and things were fine until the satilite guy arrived. What a total dick. He didn’t want to set up the satlite dish so he left. This was after I made a suggestion of which he didn’t like. Jerk off. He didn’t want to climb up on the roof nor put the cord around the building. Nevermind he could have went to the back of the building and done it there which was my suggestion but he didn’t want to hear that. I guess cuz I’m a woman. Jerk so I called another place and they said that they would get me my stuff set up on Friday. Thank goodness.    Then Seth Tony’s Parole officer called. He basically said he didn’t feel comfortable with Tony going back there sense James was refusing to allow me to have the phone number and address plus there was a change in the date which was not authorized. He said that Tony needed to call his dad and find out some information and call him back. Well Tony was gone when James called here. James did nothing but scream at me telling me that it was all my fault. The reason he left was because I sent child support after him. Excuse me no I’m on welfare they went after him on their own. That I sent insurance after him when no again that was welfare. I had no idea of what was going on until he said something to me. So I am calling Child support and telling them what is going on. That is the whole reason why he wont send money (of which he lost his business and of course that was my fault as well) and the whole reason why he had to move (they were hounding him about money ) which that is my fault too. He also said that I needed to call them off. HELLO again my hands are tied. I ended up hanging up on the prick. If it was up to me and I still might do it. I will be going to Robin and asking if I can use her address as a “in care of” and writing a notorized letter to James telling him that we have moved from our old place and that his number is blocked and that if he wants to contact Tony it has to be ether through MY e mail address OR the in care of address. I am so sick of the bullshit. Each time Tony gets done talking to him he is upset and not in a good mood. Joey and I have to deal with that. Then on top of that I deal with James who is accusing me by screaming and not listening. I wont do it. I also know that Seth is behind me on this thankfully.    I am dealing with AOL which is a pain in the butt. I am actually writing this in word and having to transfer it over because AOL is dropping me every two to five minutes. I am sick of it. I have been on the phone with them now for about 45 minutes switching and being dropped. I’m not in a good mood
