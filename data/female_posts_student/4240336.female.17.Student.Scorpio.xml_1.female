Then someone mentioned something about dressing up.  And that's when I decided, I shall pull the Steve Harris thing =P  Plus, I just realized, AG said he's trying to come up in October.  If I remember correctly, he said around the last week in October.  So maybe he can do the metal thing with me??? I think I can pull off the Steve Harris thing :p  It's the hair - I can do it with my hair.  I just need a jacket (lether one possibly) and find cloths close to what he is very notable for whereing like from a tour or something.  Then I need something that looks like a bass guitar and a strap close to his.  Hm....looks like I got some planning to do with that strap :/  And some sewing =D
