After running us down as we returned from the grocery store, she has hardly left all afternoon. I'm unaccustomed to older children, but I've been taking notes from my mother's interactions with her. 15 years of elementary teaching has taught her a thing or two about kids.  So Gavin has started learning the basics of friendship with a girl who is old enough to teach him how to share, pretend, and stay out of harm's way. Much better than Chris, who only teaches him the finer points of shrieking and pushing.   10 things I hate about you   It's important to know one's faults, so that one can aspire to improve one's self throughout life. Allow me to list some of my more prevalant flaws, since Mike has been so kind to point them out recently.  • I sing, which technically makes me a singer. Michael refers to my vocal style as "singing like an egg" - because, of course, eggs can't sing. My original creations include 'an Ode to Broccoli', 'My Icky Kicky Licky Bicky Baby', and 'I Love Your Feet'. I prefer to sing while cooking, showering, or watching Mike concentrate.  • I drive very carefully. I insist that everyone else drive carefully, as well. If it helps, I may tightly grip the driver's thigh around a precarious turn. If anyone around us is driving poorly, I will do my best to alert everyone of it. Often, other people don't know which lane to be in, so I offer friendly directives.  • I drink tea. Tea bags drain nicely in the sink, but I prefer other people dispose of them in the garbage, as it may spoil my appetite for my tea. If the sink isn't handy, a counter may suffice.  • Clean laundry makes a nice cat bed, so I try not to fold it and put it away for as many days as possible.  • Loved ones shouldn't have zits, so I help them out. When faced with protests, force may be used. Grooming is important, you know.  • I have the amazing ability to power-belch, which Mike claims is inappropriate even if only a handful of strangers are nearby. Or only himself, for that matter.  Hrmm... I suspect I can shell out another 4 flaws or so fairly easily, but flaws are debatable, aren't they? 'Flaw' may be just another word for 'skill'.
