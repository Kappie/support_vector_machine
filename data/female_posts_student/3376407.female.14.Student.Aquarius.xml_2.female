It's on Friday night at his house from like 4 - 10:30. :)I think we are going to see the second ECHO trip come home, but I think it's all mixed up right now (like what we're doing) so I'm really not sure. I'm taking two side dishes... I'm not exactly sure what they'll be right now. And I hope to wear matching shirts with Bethany and Haley Fisher. :)  So I'm taking work off - actually just getting Jessica Young to take my hours - Thursday, Friday and Saturday since I hope be going with the Blackwood's (again) to the symphony on the prairie at Conner prairie. I need to stop hanging up the phone line.  Later, Ellie
