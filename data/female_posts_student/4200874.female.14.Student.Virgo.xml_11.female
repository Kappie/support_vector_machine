Man, I thought we were screwed when that damn Anelka scored the 1st goal. I never liked him though! What a loser... He never did much for Liverpool and there he goes being the "hero" of Man City. And I hadn't realised that they had sold Diouf to Bolton. At least I knew Owen was gone.    Okay stupid thing to say.. I mean who didn't know right? Anyhows, good game... Gotta love Steven.G. Oh, I didn't fancy how Kewell played this game. He was SLOW.       I saw my school on the New Paper again yesterday. It was regarding Be Yourself Day. Sec 1,2 and 4 were mentioned. WHERE are the Sec Threes? Harlooo... Pretty cool though, especially since we've been showcased twice in a month. Ahem... was about to type somethin... not nice. Better watch my fingers. Wouldn't want the principal to mention somethin bad during morning assembly again.       Did I mention Be Yourself Day? No i don't think so. I chose to be a director, focusing on shooting music videos. That'd be really fun! Plus, I'm quite sure I've got great ideas for them. I wasn't the only director in class though. Thre were two others... extras. Hated the process of having to design our own T-shirts. Bloody freakin waste of time. Seriously. Could have studied more Geography on thursday instead of designing the damn tshirt. Oh well, it's over anyway.       Have biology test next tuesday and I need to study!! Really tough, or so Mr Lim said. (have i mentioned this before? Sounds awfully familiar) Anyhow, will start studin after I log off. Hurray for me coz I completed all my homework for the weekend!! Oh and I think there's Emath test on circles on Tuesday as well... need to remember the formulas.       Okay not too bad this weekend, so far... productive!       There's cross-country on Friday. Watchin movies after that. So far, plan is to watch The Bourne Supremacy, Stepford Wives and 13 Going On 30. Too ambitious my cousin says... so how? I'll confide in others and see what they say...      Oh well... Gonna spent more time online, once I'm done, I'll wait a while before studin Biology. Good plan rite?      -Cheers-       Doesn't matter where I'm from, where I am, how far I've come,       Doesn't matter where I live, what I have,   You want my life      Doesn't matter who I've known, what I've done, take it all     You want me as I am          I could be the one     What are you looking for?     I don't have much to give     Lord I'm ready     And through You     I could be the one     I could have hope renewed     I would hold onto what You think of me and I could be the one
