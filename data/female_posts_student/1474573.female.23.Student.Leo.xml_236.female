YES I was lot smaller then, before the college poundage before the pressure of  a j-o-b I just wanted to dive,  to just fly off the  1 meter or the 3 meter. If you dive of the platform wrong you can break your wrist/arm whatever...   Thing is I didn't care,I loved the feeling of flying. When I slept I dreamt about diving. I did pike-outs before bed and when I woke up.  During practice we got punished for fear. If we balked (chickened out) it was 20 push-ups.. and then it happened. Diving is a mental sport and in my obsession I practiced about 6 hours a day. I tried doing a back dive with 1 1/2 twists and it  was beautiful..... I went straight up, then straight down.......  onto the board.  Over the next couple of months fear crept in.... as well as my increasing sense of mortality... Off to college, and I never stepped on a board again.. I just walked away, now I'll walk off of a board and maybe maybe do a cannon ball..  When I got to new york it was slam. A jilted singing career and I tried to conquer my fear and get in touch with my anger by slamming.....and the more I did..... the more the fear crept in again......  so then I started doing muay thai... I got injured and now that I've healed I'm trying to find my way back into a gym that I've been to a million times before and left fearlessly with bruises, black eyes and busted lips... and the fear is creeping back in again...  Now it's poker....I got such a rush/release playing for the first time.....  and all of the minor rushes in between.  I just turned 23 and i feel 43...... I know I'm using these as examples but this fear has stretched into other matters of my life, places in which I'm unwilling to change, doors I'm too afraid to open, to walk through.... And I live my life a fearful person, paranoid. I'm not talking about my government conspiracy theories because they ARE watching us and I'm certainly not afraid of them.... I'm more afraid of those closest to me....  The ones I love The ones that I'm afraid to love too much The ones that I'm afraid won't love me back and each year I rack up proof I rack up a number of  people who serve as reasons as to why I shouldn't put myself out there reasons why I shouldn't be open to relationships that are healthy and provoking  and this shit happens.....fucked up people who will hurt you happen just like Im justified in my fear of diving of muay thai of loving  but isn't the feeling of flying worth the risk of falling?   so let's try at an honest moment   Amidst all of my family drama, I have a family that I've kept hidden to my friends, to my little brother. Until very recently he never knew that I was his half sister. He never knew that we didn't share the same father but I did, and I wasn't allowed to tell him. On top of this I couldn't acknowledge the only grandmother I had, still claims me as her own........ In a family that fit iller than the O.J. glove, she's the only one that ever claimed me, indignantly as her own. Swore to love me and protect me no matter what.....and the way I've treated her, ignored her, haven't acknowleged her she's still there.... 80 going on forever she still claims me hers... and it's taken me a year to return her calls and the other night I was on the phone with her.....in tears My aunt was there telling me how much she loved me, how much blood was thick, how I didn't know the whole story, how much she forgave me and I shook I just shook and shook....  with fear  I've been failed by everyone I've ever trusted in every conceivable way,   and here was this woman, my blood offering me what I'm too proud to admit that I need...   and my toes curl around the board I roll my shoulders and peer out into the water hoping to fly
