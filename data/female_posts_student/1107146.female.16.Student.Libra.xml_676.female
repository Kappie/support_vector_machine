I've been listening to their CD  Ten , and I must say, it is eleven songs (contrasting to the album's name... ...) of pure genius. The song  Black  was a nice depressing ballad through the last couple of rainy days; there's a piano in it and it somehow reminds me of rain. And, my dad was playing this album non-stop during the carefree days of five years old...ELEVEN FUCKING YEARS AGO...and it reminds me of that, as well.  Rosie brought up today that this whole "I'm not being me" thing has happened before. I agree. I think that it's just a stupid and bad thing I always do when I'm met with new situations: I try to adapt to everything more than I need to, and I end up bludgeoning everything in the wake of aftermath, and knocking holes in everyone, not disincluding myself.   Lord, this remind me of last year, sitting here making stupid EMO posts for hours. Honeybunches of oats. That's my new curse.  And speaking of EMO...I started an EMO band care of Billy Bassett. We were talking about how I look like Cousin It with my hair all in my face, and then we were talking about how cool EMO is, and then I was like..."Dude...that's the name of my EMO band...Cousin It." And Billy said it was a great name. So. I'm going to start writing EMO songs now! Woo! I'm an EMO kid and I hate my life. And you dumped me in the fifth grade...so I'm gonna make me die.  That would be the name of my production company, too.  I'm Gonna Kill Me  Music, in case anyone wants me to produce them. Oh hell. I'm not really concerned with that right now. More, I'm practicing the piano parts to  Black  and listening to Jam. Hell yeah.  Yell heah.
