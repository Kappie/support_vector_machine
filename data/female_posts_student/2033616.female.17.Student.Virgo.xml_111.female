Question:  Is is right to make a sacrifice for the team, when it means you will not be there for a close friend?  Or does showing your support for the close friend, come before the team?  Or maybe you can only skip out on the team, when many people "need" you?  You screw people over either way, but while the team may suffer the loss of a player, and the group, one less set of helping hands; when you drop that single friend, they personally suffer the loss of your apreciation, your love, and your support.  So which loss is worse?
