I think it would not matter how strong he was because if he kept doing stupid things and hurting people by it because he is stupid then he would be better off week and stupid or week and strong or smart and strong than stupid and strong. I think he causes more harm than good and i dont just get that from the movie but also but lessly form the book. I just dont like him there isint much more for me to say.
