I come close  Oh so close  But I don't   Maybe I'm a chicken  Maybe I just don't want to  But I think I do  *sigh*   I don't know anymore  I guess I'm just...  weird  odd  strange   I don't know  I just want out  No matter how  I get there  Wherever "there" is  *sigh*  I don't know anymore  Strange, isn't it?
