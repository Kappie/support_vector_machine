At first it was like a slap across the face, but the more i thought about it i realized its true. I feel like tearing my brain apart tho bcoz part of me is saying its so true lisa and the other part is saying no its not true they have no idea. But i know that its true, the rational side knows this at least neway. Its like waking up from a dream or more like a nightmare. I dno wats going on in my head, its like its all screwed up. Im confused... so confused.. so unsure and afraid. I want 2 change, im gonna change, im not gonna blow my problems out of proportion anymore im gonna stop being selfish, all of it is gonna change. This may sound confusing but all thats important is that i know wat im talking about and that all of u out there know that u should listen 2 ur enemies, they tell u ur faults.  Gdnite readers, all 2 of u i believe, but that is enough 4 me. 2 ppl who i trust so much and 2 ppl who r interested in my deeper thoughts.
