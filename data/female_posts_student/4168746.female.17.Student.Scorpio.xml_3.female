They took away any kinda colors and shit u could have. I dunno... they want it to look all bland and crap. Who knows what they were thinking on that one. If i woulda had more than only 9 entries i'd probably be a lil more upset than i even am now. haha.  I dont even know if this "blog" thing is gonna work out. Seems odd to me. Blog..what kinda word is that anyways...       But anyways  - how i like to do things - start out with a lil quote, part of a song, basically whatever i damn well feel like puttin for that day. So yea... on with today's real entry.     "There's somethin about ur love. That makes me weak. It knocks me off my feet. I dont mean to bore u with my troubles.. but i love you, i love you" - Jagged Edge and Donnell Jones 'Knocks me off my feet"           i'm reading this awesome book. "Tell Me Lies" by Jennifer Cruise... this  woman got sum talent lemme tellll you. shiiiiit, this girl got me hooked the first page. Hell, in the first to lines  the main character in the book ((maddie)) found sum black crotchless panties in her husbands car. Now come on...u  kno that would make u read on.  Go buy that book at wal-martm atleast thats where i bought it. $$2.93... for a 369 page book. COME ON NOW, wal-mart is the shiit. and i'm already on page 225 and i've only had the book 2 days. crazyness i tell ya.         MAn, i worked 1:30-10pm today. It sucked quite badly. hah. Atleast i worked with some halfway decent people. I be workin at kRogers grocery store as a bagger. Mike be runnin the floor tonight ((basically he the one tellin us what to do and when to go out on carts and when to clean  shit of that nature))... but anyways. He aint make me go on carts all damn day! i was lovin him for that.  But he had to leave at 8, and of course i was there for 2 more damn hours  that bastard Barry made me go out on carts as soon as he left. haha. i didn't mind tho, cause i hadnt been out there all day.      My next 2 or 3 checks be goin to school shit! I love me sum shoppin, i can't wait. Moms told me she isn't payin for anything this year, cause i'ma be a senior and since i gotta job she said it was my responsiblity. bullshiiiit. lol. i guess i got her on this one tho.       And before i forget. I saw Maw at work today! She came through. Damn, i didn't even notice her at first. DAMN. Thats how u kno u aint seen fam in awhile. I love her to death tho. She my momma. Always will be.      I watched the movie "Enough" yesterday ((you kno the one with jennifer lopez in it))... girl had it goin on i must say. It made me wanna take sum classes and beat the shit outta somebody. It'd do me some good. Get sum anger and hostility out.      Believe me, i got enough goin on for about 20 people. Moms got breast cancer, goes into surgery on weds. SuCkS AsS lemme tell you. Pops is still in the process of gettin the rest of his teeth pulled. And he got sum crazy shit goin on with that cause they got a lotta infection and they gotta scrape it out, and then put stitches in there. So you kno he be in bitch mode. Lets see.... i'll prolly lose my job within the next few weeks. Superwal-marts' food center is opening up about 200 yards from kroger. *tear*. hah. My brother had to quit his niiice job at the distribution center cause they tried to keep him from goin to his classes ((devRy university biatches)).  So he still tryin to find a job and he gotta fiance and a lil baby to take care of. My gangsta neice aaliyah. MY BABY GIRL! i love her to death. She sooo cute. She 4 months old now. Moms goin crazy with  takin pictures tho. That needs to stop. She got enough to give everyone in Marion 2 pics of that kiid. hah. i love her tho. Much love for them both actually... haha who knew.       Well enough for now.. my hands gettin a bit tiired.   Live it up.
