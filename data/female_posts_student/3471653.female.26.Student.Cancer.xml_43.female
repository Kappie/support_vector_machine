(Hopefully we'll soon be able to show you one of the other cool birthday presents I received...)  What's striking to me in all these books is Augustine's attitude toward sex.  It's really clear that he thinks that celibacy is the highest good.  He affirms the holiness of marriage, but says that sex should be used only for procreation.  Quoting Paul, he says that marriage is good, but that celibacy is better.  And when you read him, you get the very strong impression that he thinks celibacy is much, MUCH better.     This is worlds away from any modern teaching I've ever heard.  Following Luther, early Protestants affirmed marriage and abolished monastic vows in order to distinguish themselves from pre-Reformation Catholicism.  More recently, both Catholic and Protestant Christians have tried to combat our culture's emphasis on (not to say obsession with) unrestrained sex by affirming marriage as the only right and good context for sexual activity.    Well, I'm all for marriage (and have been for more than six months now)!  But what about Christians who never marry, for one reason or another?  What is their role in the Church?  To identify Christian life with "family values"--or even with the fullness of Christian motherhood and fatherhood--leaves celibates high and dry.  It implies that every Christian’s calling is to marriage and parenthood; few are paying attention to adult women and men who do not fit these roles.  To "single" Christians it must seem as though they are incomplete-—that they can’t be complete Christian men and women until they are married.  This message is not intentional on the church’s part; but it is there.     My question is this: can Protestants think of celibacy as anything other than a temporary condition, to end when (never  if ) the Christian marries?    How can a Christian be a lifelong celibate and fulfill his identity as a Christian man or woman?  How can we honor the celibates among us as much as we honor the mothers and fathers?    If celibacy is what Augustine suggests that it is, then those who are celibate--and those who surround them--need to have as much theological and practical teaching about a celibate way of life as we do about marriage.  And that means details: what is their function in the church?  How should they conduct their daily lives?  And how can they cope in a godly way with long-term loneliness and childlessness?   For one interesting take on this, see, as usual,  urlLink David Morrison's thoughts , hopefully the first in a series.  But Morrison is Catholic.  I suspect that we won't be able to answer the question without being taught by the Catholics, maybe in ways we won't like.
