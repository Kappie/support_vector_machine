Our lecturer was all right, he teaches or is a Dean somewhere in Jamacia Queens. The driving teacher was nice, I'm in a car with Mike and Luke I think there names are, and Sal. Everyone except for me drove like an old person. It's from 8:30 AM to 11:45 AM. After that I smoked for a couple of hours and then went to the plaza and came home at 9:30 PM. Exciting day.
