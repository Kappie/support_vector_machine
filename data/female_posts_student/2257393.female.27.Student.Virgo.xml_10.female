(i mean, sure, i could tell you how the whole time today during the baby shower we had at work for one of my co-workers i was thinking about how maybe i'll never know what it feels like to be pregnant or to have a kid to ground for doing something stupid, but you've read enough of that in earlier entries and it's all terribly boring anyway.)  things will get worse.  and they'll get better.  and then they'll get worse again.  and then they'll get better.  my goal is to make sure they spend more time on the better end than on the worse.  and that ultimately they end on the better.    the big C.  right behind heart disease for the biggest killer.  well, screw you, big C.  you picked the wrong brain (quite possibly the worst pun ever made) in which to crash.    one more thing (and i hope i don't die and suddenly these blog postings become something that gets distributed to my family at the funeral), i went to confession this afternoon.  i went because more than anything, i'm looking for some courage and some peace of mind and somewhere to draw some strength.  so i fell back on the most basic of my catholic grade school tenets--need help?  talk to a priest!    well, as i should have predicted, it didn't exactly turn into the soul-cleansing moment of clarity i hoped it would be.  despite my attempts to explain to the priest, who was a very kind man and very well-versed in the chatechism, that i didn't know what to do with my fears and my weakness at a time in my life in which i wanted faith and strength, he went through the 10 commandments to make sure we covered all of my sins.   sigh...  what was i thinking?  it was the sacrament of reconcilliation!  at least now i can go forward with a clear conscience, except that i don't really feel repentant for having "fornicated".  he told me as my penance to read psalm 86.  i haven't done it yet.  could it be that my solace and strength could be in that psalm?  i won't put that expectation on it, but i'll try to be open to whatever it has to tell me.  and, despite the 8 to 10 years that have passed since i've gone to confession, i still managed to recite the act of contrition verbatim.  damn right.  see that brain tumor?  you ain't got shit  (oh well, there goes that clearing of conscience for the swear words).    tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
