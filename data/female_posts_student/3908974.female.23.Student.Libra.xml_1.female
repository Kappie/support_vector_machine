Had to go retrieve my television from the pawn shop.  I'd never been to one before, then I got in a bind a couple of weeks ago.  Tried to give plasma, but this town is the Midwestern Hub for the Homeless, and there was a line four days long.  Some of the people I passed in the waiting room looked like they'd been sucked dry.  Bad skin, dull hair and unfocused eyes.  I might have done it in spite of the wait, even though I'm so afraid of needles that I've put nurses in headlocks before just getting bloodwork done.  But then I saw someone in the lab behind the counter hold up the instrument they use to take the plasma.  I won't call it a needle!!  No, it's like a fucking PIPE as big around as a knitting needle and four inches long.  One look at it and I got tunnel vision and had to breathe in breathe out and find my "special place" just to drive myself back home.  So I had to put my tv in hoc, because I am a chickenshit.     I am BROKE after all those grad school application fees, then I didn't get any student loans because my status changed back to "dependent" after the Big Divorce.  And, of course, I'm prone to spending anyway.    So I got the tv back, which is a relief because it's the only thing I have besides an imac worth more than fifteen bucks.  Now my roommate can watch Friends again (which I hate), and it will be a Peaceable Kindom.    No Lucinda Williams.  Her mom died.  I really wanted to see her.  The next concert I'm for sure attending is David Bowie, and he's more of a novelty.  I dig the music, but the reason my friend got me a ticket is that it's common knowledge in my circle that my first crush ever was on David Bowie when he played the evil wizard in Labyrinth.  I was maybe six?  I watched that movie again last year, and I was surprised at how much he looks like a woman.  All that big hair and eye shadow.  (?)  I also thought MacGyver was hot, and he had a mullet.  Can't help the eighties I guess.   Anyway, no other big events pending.  I just found out I get to see Bart from Oregon, who let me and my dad stay at his place when we were in Eugene to see the Grateful Dead.  I still remember the banana slugs in his backyard where we pitched our tent, and the way he had ticket stubs as wallpaper in his kitchen.  And the "happy cookies" he made, which I now understand were made with hashish.  I was only 12 then.  The day after we got back to Manhattan, I started junior high.  What a trip!  I wonder if he'll recognize me.  I used to be such a little eyesore.  Now people say I look like my mom, which is well with me.    I try not to care too much how I look because in time, I will be tucking my tits in my pants and thinking blue is a complimentary color for my hair.  I want to have something else going on besides the look.  But it's hard sometimes.  I'm always on a fucking diet, even though the rational part of me knows I'm not fat.  I'm tempted to spend money on contact lenses so I don't have to dork around in glasses anymore.  And I waste way too much time wondering what other people see when they look at me.    If I could be like a guy in one respect, it would be the relative lack of concern they have for appearances--They're OWN, at any rate.  I see old guys all the time who still think they look dashing in formal wear they wore twenty years and twenty pounds ago.  Buttons bust off, and it's the PANTS' fault, not their fault for having huge pendelous guts.  Women cry and berate themselves and go pay doctors tosuck their asses off with long needles when faced with similar situations.  What a world!
