Well...contrary to that belief, I am a pretty darn good cook...BUT during the rodeo I helped out with the concession stand making burgers. They're the same burgers sold at every concession stand I've ever been to, but they look....ummm....NOT SO GOOD! After cooking a few of them, Mindy and I checked the ingredients...did you know they put ground beef hearts into those things? AND they weren't even pink, it looked like pork...with NO pork...or so the label says. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the burgers, but Mindy and I just could not bring ourselves to eat them...Dairy Queen-here we come!! This happened before lunch and around 4pm...Stacie, Joanna, Robbi, Mary, Crystal, and myself were all ready for the 'Calf Dressing' event in which three people are on a team, have a pair of huge shorts (or 'panties'), and there's a steer with a halter and lead rope waiting for us in the chute. The purpose is to put the shorts on the steer and take them to the circle in the middle of the arena. Everyone was pretty nervous and I don't care what anyone says, for a couple of women weighing in at 100 to 140lbs, a 300lb steer was massive in size!! So, open the chutes and let the game begin! Our steer came out in a rage and on his back feet! I remember looking him in the eye and then eating dirt as I saw hooves and legs and people all around. Once standing, we get the steer to the circle in the middle of the arena. Then there's the announcer..."Looks like someone's dropped their panties in the arena!" In between gasps for air, our steer was finally calm, Mary, Crystal, and I all look at one another and then about 50yrds away, there lie our calf's panties...SHIT! Who's gonna go get them?! Off Mary goes and it's round and round in circles from there. We got tangled up with the other girls steer and then thay both got loose and ran to the other end of the arena. Finally..we each catch our steer and try once more with the panties...to no avail. We lost, another team won...and I was pretty mad..I don't know why, I barely have a temper problem!! So I started walking to the gate, picked up someone's panties they'd dropped and about the time I lifted up from getting them a loose steer comes running at me! I shooed him off and he kicked the air...yep, I was as upset as he was about being in the arena. But, once my nerves cooled, a smile was back on my face and all of us were making fun of each other and recalling the whole ordeal. Besides a couple of huge bruises, teeth marks, and cow-shit all over Stacie, a great time was had by all! So, after a shower and a bowl of cereal, we all hit the town for a fun night out....one that was WELL deserved!
