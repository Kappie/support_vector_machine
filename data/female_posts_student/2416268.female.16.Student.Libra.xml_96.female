Anyways........*thinks*..........  ah yes that would be be it wouldnt it Nat........more of the confusion to come me thinks..................  Hmmmm Ooh yes I really think that, maybe, just maybe mind you I have started to scare a few people with my nonsense rambling posts (yes you Joe)……mwahahahahahahahaha, oh and speaking of Joe……..Emily Witt is now working at the body shop,   hmmm I think that the Body Shop has implanted something into peoples memories to make them work there…I mean it seems to be attracting everyone….hmmmm something is defiantly happening there…maybe they are transmitting some sort of  brain washing media…..hmmmmm I think that I think way to much….and not about the important things….like my exams, lol  woohoo………………………………………………….it is nearly the time when there are no more exams to think about, only how to spend as much money as possible on shopping trips, or how long can I possibly lay here without moving? Or what beach shall I visit today?…………hmmmm the summer……*sighs*………. Ooh and of course visiting everyone………I will see all of you whether you like it or not.
