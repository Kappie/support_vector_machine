Well, today, my dad was driving a truck (I don't know why we have it, we just do)- a BIG diesel truck. And we took it down, hooked it up to teh horse trailer, and just as we were leaving to go back to the house, my dad locked himself out of it. Thus, confirming the suspicion that my mom, my dad, my sister, and myself are blondes at heart, if not in the head. For the following reasons: My mom: Locks herself out of car on first day. Puts anti-itch cream in dishwasher. Can't find keychain on her car keys. My dad: Locks himself out of car on first day. My sister: Asks if we let dead people out of prison. Myself: I'm only blonde in the head, not at heart.  Love From the Best 1/4th, Phileda
