Ever wondered why Elizabeth Taylor is so famous? Then this is one of many movies that can explain it to you, she was 17 when she made this movie, but already a fullgrown woman and the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen.  Before Marlon Brando and James Dean there was Montgomery Clift, an extraordinary actor and very good looking. Taylor would later say that it was on the set of this movie and her encounter with Clift that made her take movie making seriously.
