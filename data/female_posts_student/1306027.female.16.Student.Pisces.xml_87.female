Why? Because he sucks. His political campaign is just one big joke. Granted, he does deserve some credit for running at all, but really, do we need another clinton in office? Kerry says one thing, than changes it, and even then, decides to do something completely different from the original two.  If I were 18 this coming voting round, I would definately vote for Bush. Granted, Bush has had some rough times in the white house these past years, but he was still definately the man we needed to get us through these post 911 years. It's with this statement I end my post: "I got nothing but love for the Bush".  Anti-Kerry Pins:  urlLink Pin 1   urlLink Pin 2
