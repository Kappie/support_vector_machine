I think i will be in a superchick mood for a long time now... here's another song  Some people bring you gifts Some bring you bricks to weight you down so they can swim a little higher  while you drown  some people mean so well Their way was the best way that they found But any other way you choose is a brick that weights you down  So tell me what do I do with this backpack Full of bricks and sticks and stones and words that stuck to me like ticks (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be  Some people give themselves a brick I know most people do  when we compare We fall short somewhere ItÂ¹s always true  if all we see is where we fall We've bricked a prison wall  instead of trying to learn to fly We've taught ourselves to crawl   So tell me what do I do with this backpack Full of bricks and sticks and stones and words that stuck to me like ticks (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be  we could believe in ourselves More we could try for unique Instead of trying to conform We could defy what they tell us  Don't buy the lies they sell us if we're brave we can believe in what we are  (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be
