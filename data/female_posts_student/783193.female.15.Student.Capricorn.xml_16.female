And she was like, like smoking once or something. I was like, ick, no. Now I'd be like, ICK, NO! Oh my goodness- the amount of smoke there is unbearable. Half the time my shirt was over my mouth and nose, and the other time, my whole face was covered so I wouldn't have to see all the slutty people, or as my sister calls them, "ugly people". Now I'm in my seriouso laundry mode. Tomorrow I'm going with Choo for some last minute Christmas shopping at Stoneridge, and then later, we have some caroling to do. I hope I don't freeze over or anything. Hmph. There's so much to do.. but right now, I'm enjoying my own procrastination. Hannah said she might cut her hair... boo. I hope she doesn't. She has, like, the prettiest hair in the world. I can't even imagine her with shoulder length hair. Hmm... finished To Kill a Mockingbird today in the car on the way back. The other three hours I spent giving my other sister little braids all over.. kind of like cornrows.. but not. I did like, all her hair, and then when we got home, she took more than half of them out! Eek! Then, when I opened my screen, there was this advertisement that was like, What do Women Really Want for Christmas? And I was thinking, guys are so insensitive and stupid, they honestly don't seem to care. Weeeeell.. not all.  More text-y stuff for you.  sindyburnburn: she called lyke..a porno audition or something sindyburnburn: and they askedsindyburnburn: "are yoo over 18" "yes" "are yoo shaved?" "excuse me?" "are yoo shaved, becuz a fur pie doesn't sell" sindyburnburn: orr..something lyke that YooRmaIsUnsHynE: haha sindyburnburn: i have lyke..a bug bite on my head sindyburnburn: its weird YooRmaIsUnsHynE: oh dear.. i suppose itchy pies dont sell either sindyburnburn: i gues not
