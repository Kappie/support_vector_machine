I use stuff like ‘poop’ and ‘pee’, while she uses ‘damn’, and ‘crap’. Yup. In case you were wondering.  I watched ‘The Butterfly Effect’ yesterday, together with Susie (aka my kinder-garden home girl). It’s a truly amazing movie, and I loved it. I didn’t really think that Ashton Kutcher could do such a serious part (no offence, Ashton), but it turns out that he’s not just some hormone-sweetheart-celebrity boy, he’s an actual actor. Yay for him.  I was planning on renting another movie tonight, but that’s as far it got (to the planning). So I guess I’m gonna strap myself to the sofa, and watch some quality Saturday night television till I drop. Also gonna consume some unhealthy amounts of crisps, candy and Pepsi. Gotta have Pepsi, right?  It’s so damn hot! It’s like, 30ºC outside, and about the same inside. I had to sleep with a pony tail last night, because my hair was so warm… And I also had to have my bedroom window wide open, and my door, and the terrace door on the other side of the loft was also wide open.  Obsession of the moment:  Tara MacClay’s song in ‘Once more with feeling’. Also: her dress in that episode. Amber Benson rocks!        Looking wicked good singing in that dress, right? Wish I had one just like it...
