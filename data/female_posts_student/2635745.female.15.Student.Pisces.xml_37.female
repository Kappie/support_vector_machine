And that pissed me off.  The fact that no one can have different opinions about him other than the ones you have set out for us.  I really don't think he's that bad.  Christina and Chelsea have told me some hilarious stories.  And he actually seems kinda cool.  But do remember the other day at lunch when I was talking to Erica and Becca about how for Les Mis they wanted him to cut his hair and he refused.  You caught on to what I was saying and made everyone shut up so you could hear.  That is what ticks me off.  The only way I can communicate with you and actually have you pay attention is if I mention him.  But now that you don't want to talk to me about him, I guess you don't need to hear about all the hilarious things he did on the set during rehearsals.  I got the stories so I could possibly talk to you, but as that isn't going to happen I suppose I'll just keep those stories to myself.  And Becca has offered an invitation to Erica and I to eat lunch in Mr. Millers room with her and her friends.  Maybe there I won't have to worry about people taking offense to everything I say and I could possibly carry on a normal, interesting conversation, in which no one hypervenalates (sp?).
