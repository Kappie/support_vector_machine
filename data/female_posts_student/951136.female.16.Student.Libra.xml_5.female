I dont know what i could posssibly do for them. they are both stubborn and stuck on their ways.  it was tough.  -A friendship that can cease has never been real -even best friends cannot get along 24/7 those are some of the things said that i CANNOT agree with at all. thats not the way its supposed to be at all. and thats only a glimpse at it, its tough and i hate to see freinds fight. b.c. it takes so much out of the group, not to mention takes out fun when you have to plan aroudn to ppl that wont look at each other. shit.   and i almost fell asleep taking my alg 2 quiz. GA! and in mrs demel i had just come from lunch and band. psh. i had to much CRAP ass shit on my mind. i would answer a question and then sit there thikning about everything completely different besides who was king of the AKKADIANS. which i left blank...sigh.  chis is so gay, i'm sorry, but you cannot even refute that! you should have heard him talking today. i love him. but its just so funny to think that he might think he's straight. then again!!!!! he may be like Josh in "TALKING WITH ADDISON"- the book i'm reading.  alanah, dont look at me the way you did when i stopped and went to looked back. in the hallway after school. dont look at me like that. we have to work on our seperate peace diarama thingy, whatever you want to call it, tuesday and wednesday. it will be fine. sorry i had to cancel on you today.  life is so simple! it makes me sick!!! complicated with my own onetrack, one-minded,one sided, nothingness thoughts. but thats only from LACK of excitement plagueing me right now!  so! in light of that!!! and having said nothing again for the past 30 minutes! i am going to go do my homework...  where is the love people?...
