Lol that sounds stupid but its true. Sigh, its because I got in some trouble with a teacher…its pretty complicated actually. But its my blog and I’m gonna write!!  I had given my class teac the class photograph order list to give to the teacher in charge. Blahblah, that was 1 month ago!?! 2 days ago, the teacher in charge of the photos came up to me and told me hand up the form and pay the money by that very day. I told her that I had already given the form to my class teach a loooong time ago, she told me to settle. Fine, i went to my class teac and told her, she said she’d looked for the form cos apparently she had lost it. By the end of the day, it was still lost, i got fed up and handed her the money to give to the teacher in charge when she had found it. Today, class teac asked me to ask the class again who wanted photos, and mind you they had all paid and 3k students aren’t famous for the memory skills. And dadadadada, after I had done everything, I went to her table and guess what? The original form was there… urgh.. so much for hard work and forcing my classmates brains to squeeze out their faint memory of who ordered photos. And the money is with the class teac btw, so I couldn’t take the form and give it to teac in charge. And during recess, the teac in charge was pretty upset, asked me to settle. I was busy, couldn’t find class teac OR teac in charge. I’m gonna die.   You see, the teacher in charge of the pics, she’s pretty infamous for her sarcasm skills. And I mean it man, she can blow the top of you with her sarcasm. Its amazing to see her in action, when the mangsa is somebody else la………………………….   Besides that, exam is next Friday and I’m scared, trust me. 3 years worth of studies for 10 subjects.. Mari kita bunuh diri? Lol.   MaryLamb gonna be eaten by the Wolf.
