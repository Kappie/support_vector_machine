Then since we felt fat we went for a half an hour bike ride to burn of FAT (in jillians n rachels words). On our bike ride we went to Jillians step moms house and we played with her cats and took our older sisters candy from her room when she was out with her friend. After we biked back to Michelles summer house and went on Msn. Rachel left but micheel and jillian are going to play basketball on playstation! But Michelle is going to try to write Jillian when she goes to holland, and when she is home again in Paris.   g2g bubyies xoxox
