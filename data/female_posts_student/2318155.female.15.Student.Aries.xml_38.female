"ahhhhhchooooo.....sry im alergic to bull shit" wow thats a good line me and cory were luvin it. ha i went to 7 eleven, got some condoms just in case. i feel a lot better cause when the moment comes and u dont have a condom, damn does it ruin the moment. so now that moment wont be ruined....as long as i have my purse with me. well anyways i thought u guys would all like to kno that danette has condoms in her possesion because her ex bf took the ones she used to have. haha well i think thats enough of me talkin bout condoms, damn i really hope this doesnt get to my mom and dad. o well... blo job betty on the way to rescue u (:
