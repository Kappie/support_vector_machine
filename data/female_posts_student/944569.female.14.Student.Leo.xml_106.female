I promised this time i would not get hurt.  I took the risk i meant to not take but it aches at my heart still.  I know this was a bad time.  I know that when i'm not with you my presence will fade from your mind.  Was it just a game or truth?  Will i fade from your eyes next year?  Questions pepper my mind anxiously.  I want to see you.  I want to talk to you but i doubt that you do as well.... Aren't you glad i'm gone?
