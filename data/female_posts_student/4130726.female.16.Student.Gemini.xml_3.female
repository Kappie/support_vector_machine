I witnessed thirty year old men naked on web cams. They are like ravenous dogs fighting for a scrap of meat. I tell them why I don't like cams, and they keep asking me to do one. That shows that they have no respect for my emotions and that they weren't listing when I told them that I didn't want to. My life will forever be lonely, and I am cursed to wander the desolate streets of heartbreak and loneliness. Ha ha I am so dramatic. Enough of woman hate men talk, it is all too common. My poor messenger crashed because it was clogged with stupid people IMing their perverted messages to me. I am not that way, I respect my body and I am not reckless with my sexual behavior. It is all to common. I don't think the chat rooms should be like this. I am sixteen, and I have ample access to this filth. Parents, think of your sixteen year old daughter. The threats of internet are disgusting. Its terrible that we Americans are exposed to high amounts of filth each day, and we continue to tolerate it. In my opinion, sexual promiscuity is not okay. There are risks like pregnancy and STIs that I am not willing to deal with. How long are we going to live like this? How far will this go? The drinking, the drugging, the hate... I have witnessed it all. This is not a world that I want my future kids to live in. Its gross and sick. We have to work together and stop this!
