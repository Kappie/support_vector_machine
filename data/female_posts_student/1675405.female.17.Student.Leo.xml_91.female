Because sometimes, I just wonder how much of it is shaping the person that I am becoming. Instead of dealing with what is thrown in my way, I've become accustomed to just grin and bear it. Is this what the purpose of living life is? For a quick "run-though," when instead of dealing with problems, I just glance, smile like I care, and continue on my way? I'm just beginning to realize that I'm doing things all wrong. I'm worth a hell of a lot more than people are treating me. So, their gonna start doing things my way, or no way at all.     I don't understand.  Why do some people tend to breeze through life happily while I have to work to achieve any sort of satisfaction?   Please God, help me. Stop making waking up so damn hard.
