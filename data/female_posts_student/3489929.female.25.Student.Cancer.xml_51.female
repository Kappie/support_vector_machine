It's not that I'm wishy-washy; it's that every class I wanted to take conflicted time-wise with another one I wanted to take, and I had to compromise on a couple. But I am pretty sure I am set now. I'm taking 5 classes, so I can kind of ease my way back into things. The mistake I made my freshman year was signing up for 8 classes, including two required seminars, and I got so overwhelmed I had to drop one of them and take it in the spring. I want to make sure I can handle everything this time.  I'm taking a required junior composition course; although I only have 50 total credit hours (10 short of junior status), I have enough prerequisites that they will let me in anyway (and because of my *sniff* advanced age). I will also be taking two other English classes: English Lit of the 19th Century, and Adolescent/Children's Lit, which I  hope  will be as fun as it sounds. I am also taking the second half of Western Civ (I AP'ed out of the first half) and College Algebra, which will be my only required math class to graduate, and here's hoping I actually pass it this time (I took it freshman year and did not exactly fail, but I might as well have, seeing as how getting a D is making me have to take the damn class all over again). I am praying for a C. That's all I want. A frickin' C.  So, save the horrors of algebra, it will be a seemingly easy way to slip back into scholarly mode. Here's hoping.
