That was mean.  2. We were handing out roses as everyone was heading out to the parking lot, and we're giving out three. This girl takes about 7 home. Maybe more. We gave her a very generous bunch. And then she turns around as if she's going to come and get more, and she does. She doesn't really seem secure about herself. I've seen her around, it's more ostentatious displays of "fitting in."  I'm not very nice, aren't I?  But today was a good day. I'll shush now.
