I realize you can't hold back reality you can't hold back what is meant to happen and what is not. I guess you have to embrace what life has in stock for you. I used to tell all of you to stop dreaming because it will never happen right? Well i'm going to spin things around.  Chase the rainbows, count the stars, reach the unreachable because someday you just might overcome the impossible. and if you don't? I just might have to kill you. haha no i just felt like saying that. Who cares if you've failed, who cares if you didn't get what you want, who cares if you aren't what they want you to be, who cares if you've made the same mistakes one too many times, who cares? you're still my hero.
