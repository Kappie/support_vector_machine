Well worth the three days. :)     You are a Day Dreamer..   Daydreamers tend to be away from the normal, and have a deeper aspect when looking at things. Most of the time, thier outcasts of the social society, but don't worry. It just means your so deep it scares thier simple little brains.    urlLink   What kind of Dreamer are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      There's a lot on my mind again.. It's a weird feeling when you have so much to think about, that you can't even think straight. It's like... you don't know where to start;  how  to start.    I think I'll go to bed. It's been a long day.
