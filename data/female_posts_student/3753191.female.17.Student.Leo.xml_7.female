That would top it off nicely.   What is it about me?  I'm just different from other people.  Instead of having several acquaintances, I keep a few very close friends.  Now I realize why so many people choose to keep a bit of a distance from their 'friends.'  It's not such a hard loss if one slips through your fingers.  I'm not perfect by any means.  Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm temperamental, moody and easily agitated.  I don't choose my words carefully (or keep my mouth shut) when I probably should.  I realize I have been stricken with these traits and attempt to keep them in check as much as I can, but it usually doesn't work.  Why should I be so surprised when I offend or hurt someone close to me?   You know what, I need to stop taking advantage of people.  The friend I lost today always kept a cool head with me even when I wasn't the most pleasant person to chat with.  He dealt with my flaws better than most people could, and I screwed it up because I allowed myself to take advantage of his good nature.   So, you-know-who, I am sincerely sorry.  I don't expect things to ever be the same, nor do I expect you to talk to me again, but please know that I regret what I said.   By the way, I finally broke 100k in mids.  Still haven't beat you though.   Figures.
