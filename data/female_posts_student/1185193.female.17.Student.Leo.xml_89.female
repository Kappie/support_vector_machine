It's a woman's memoir of struggling, enduring, and surviving a cutting disorder. Poignant, blunt, and well-written.          urlLink the curious incident of the dog in the night-time    A physcological thriller bound to be a classic someday.  Same diction and style as  The Catcher in the Rye . Christopher (main character) struggles with mental abnomalities while being challenged with external conflicts. His relentless curiosity leads him to investigate the death of a neighbor's dog, and he ends up learning more than he bargained for.      urlLink Island of Illusions    I came across this book on our travels to Harmony, Minnesota--a quaint Amish town. It was only 25 cents, so I figured, why not. Your typical romance novel. Karen (main character) meets Solo (her lover) through an assignment from the FBI. Both are agents. After breaking the reins from her controlling mother and conquering other internal struggles, she and Solo live happily ever after. Of course the 'happily ever after' comes after some steamy romance scenes on the beach. I wouldn't pay more than the 25 cents for it; nonetheless, a good indulgence.         urlLink The Secret Life of Bees    Indescribable. Classic, obvious innocence to awareness theme in American Literature. About Lily's (main character) journey growing up having to deal with the fact that she killed her mother when she was little, and she now has to live with an abusive father. Until she escapes with her nanny and finds a group of women beekeepers who forever change her. You have to buy this book and read it. It is superbly excellent.         urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim    Brillantly satirical. Each chapter is a different story about an ordinary time in David's (main character) life. The skill of this author is readily apparent, demonstrated in his way of making ordinary things humorous and interesting. Definitely a good buy.         urlLink Reading Lolita in Tehran    A definite waste of $13.95. I read about one quarter of this book, then put it down in distaste. The concept sounded like a good one: Thursday mornings, a liberal American teacher in Tehran teaches outlawed books to some of her most prized students. True story, by the way. But the book was going nowhere, and the concept itself was underdeveloped. I'd like to give another author a try at this plot--to turn a misguided read into a triumph.
