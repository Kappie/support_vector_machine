Travis and Walter decided to go to Lyle, (that's across the river from Hood River, and its in Washington) yesterday evening about 6pm for a short climb. All I heard was it was going to be alot of fun and it is by the water. I kind of got the idea when Travis told me that we will be climbing the walls,alongside the edge of the Columbia Gorge river. I didn't think twice about it, so yeah of course, I was going to go and try this thing out. It was an half an hour drive, with beautiful scenery along the way,even though it was already past 6pm. The sun was still pretty strong but it wasn't hot hot. We arrived, the view was just beautiful, I could see the whole of Columbia gorge, mountains with the sides that has different shapes and sizes, there were tonnes of vegetation, rail road running along side of the gorge. There was nothing in the way blocking this gorgeous view. And we were there to climb.     We got ready, Travis showed me a side that it was much easier to start on, around the level of 5-7, 5-8. Got my shoes on and my chalkball bag secured around my waist. Yeah I was ready to climb. Travis was of course leading me;we both climbed down this edge that lead us down to the river and started traversing at the edge of the river. Not too bad the first move, the rocks had pretty big foot holes and good grip for the hands but as I moved further, it was getting abit tricky. I am still not a very experience climber and at the same time knowing that I am not supported and could just fall easily right into the river...wel yeah, go figure...I WAS BEGINING TO PANIC! The adranaline rush, trying to hold on and figuring out how to move from then on was ridiculous, although I had Travis help showing me the routes to take, I didn't feel very confident in moving. Finally, came to a point where there this big huge protruding rock that I had to go around, with my little experience and lack of technique, I had no way on how to overcome that route problem. Although I wanted so much to try it out but knowing that if I fail to miss grabing on to one of those rocks, I was going to fall right into the water. I did not want my chalk bag to get wet and that would be the end of my climb for the day. The tricky part was getting back up to safety, we stopped at the that protruding rock point and started to climb upward which was at least 5 feet to reaching the top. Took me at least 15 minutes to climb that 5 feet cause there was a point that I needed to really lifted my leg up high to lift myself up to the next foot hole. It was ridiculous, for a not confident me, it took me forever to climbed up. Of course, I did make it in the end, holding on for dear life. Once I reached the top (yeah, solid ground), I was absolutely relieved! I was able to breath again with ease.     yes and that is my story. Will I go back and climb again! HELL YEAH. There's nothing more than to keep doing it again and again, the feeling of beating the river by not falling into it is the best feeling I could get.
