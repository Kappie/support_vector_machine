We decided to stay an extra day, in order to avoid the rain on the way back...              ...so thats the official story anyway. WE HAD A BLAST!  As I relayed in my last post, there were a few discouragement before getting underway. And-it was looking very not cool for a 5 hour ride on the bike to the coast. we hadn't even got out of the city on Sunday morning when we had to stop and pull over because of heavy thunderstorms. (by the way, i think it was an  isolated  thunderstorm, haha) we parked at a gas station for about 45 min, wondering if we should call it off after all. the storm was low enough to see what direction it was headed, so when it went in the direction we came from, we decided to take our chances.  urlLink    pre-hitting the road gas up urlLink     urlLink    note the luggage urlLink     we had to stop a few times, and finally found a wal-mart where we picked up rain gear. much smoother sailing from that point. (naturally) all the rain was in the city. suckers! outside of the city, Texas becomes a different world. we went through so many stranded towns interspersed with very beautiful country. we stopped off for gas in a town that was charmingly antiquated, that was in the middle of the "watermelon thump" festival. Don't ask me.... following is a picture of us there (if i can manage to upload it)   urlLink    middle of nowhere (nixon, tx) urlLink      ... i think this is what my not-texan friends think of when they think of texas, but these areas of texas really remind me of PA.    urlLink    yucky weather urlLink      i would have liked to get more pictures of the horizon, but cameras and motorcycles are not the ideal option; instead i will describe some of it for you... imagine that someone had sliced off the top of your car. as a passenger, I am free to look at everything my car windshield cant show me. i can find shapes in the clouds, watch horses and their foals fun across huge ranges. you can see for miles no, no cacti or desert. once we got closer to the coast, i could smell the ocean. i really love that smell, and i love the sound of surf. when i find the time to meditate or relax, the ocean is the place my mind goes.  so anyway, we had to cross a ferryboat to get to the island. it made me nervous, i was afraid that the bike would fall over. of course that didn't happen, but i still couldnt get used to the ferry even though we crossed on it a few times..   urlLink    the BF had no problem with the ferry, as you can see. (note the change of weather) urlLink     we had beautiful weather once we got there. we found our lodge pretty quickly. it was hard to miss. it was called "the laughing horse" and was decorated pretty crazy. it was cute   urlLink    blinded by the light.... urlLink     our first night there we went to a local niteclub and drank entirely to much, well, i did anyway, but we took a cab so no harm no foul-except for my headache the next day... Day two to follow later.. i mean i do have a life other than this computer, you know... well not really but it is my b-day! so i will post the rest of my vacation story soon i promise
