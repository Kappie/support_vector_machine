The funny thing was that the sound guy didn't show up, so they were kinda having technical difficulties and Nathaniel had to do alot of it by himself.  it was still pretty good.  Nathaniel's choir was pretty awesome with their Chicago medley! After the show, Kendra and Kristen took me to Dairy Queen but before we went there we had to deal with this dog that she's dog sitting.  The dog would not go to the restroom and it kept on getting under all the porch furniture which was annoying because we couldn't really get him.  Dairy Queen was fun, except i don't really remember much of it and i don't know why.  All i know is that i had fries and Kendra and Kristen had mint chocolate ice cream.  Oh yeah at the vivace show, they had an act where these Indian girls came on and did a dance, it was soooo cool.  Taylor said it was dacing like that, that made her wish she had a culture.  I feel the same way.  Kristen said American culture is "hey lets all be sluts or something!" (i don't really remember actually, but it was pretty funny).    Ani said that me and him should elope when we're both legal just because we want to use the Drive Through Marriage Chapel in Las Vegas.  He knows that his Indian parents would totally freak out if he married a white girl, especially eloped with one, so thats why we're going to do it.  Its going to be awesome lol!  Of course, we probably won't actually go through with this unless we're on something.....haha but when me and Ani get together, you never know lol.  Darn the trash people, they woke me up this morning.  Me and Taylor Stewart decided that we should both be in Vivace because we can dance really well.....but the only problem is that we can't sing.  Maybe they'll just let us be a part of the hip hop troupe thing.  alright i'm going to go eat something and drink some caffeine......i think over the past month, my caffeine intake has slowly increased and i had worked so hard to try and get off that addiction! agh!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
