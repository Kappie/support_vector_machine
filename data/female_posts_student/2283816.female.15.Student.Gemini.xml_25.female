Went to Abby's and hung out inside for awhile and did nothing... then Katie came and we went outside and talked about like nothing. Then we went on a walk and talked some more about nothing. And then we went for a ride in a paddleboat and talked some more about nothing and drank a lot of cans of stuff. I had Brisk. Annnnnnd we came in and had hamburgers, and then we went downstairs and made up personalities and stuff and almost set Abby's room on fire, HA! And then we ate Oreo pie and we discovered that it is unwise to let Abby cut things.   Really.  You know, for quiet people we talk a lot.  Anyway, it felt good to just hang outside (which I NEVER do, by the way) and get away from it all...
