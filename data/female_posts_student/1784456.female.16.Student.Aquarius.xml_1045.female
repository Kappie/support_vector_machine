I was walking home - across Golden Valley School field and I could barely walk because of the wind and because of that all the rain was getting swept up into my face and it hurt! I couldn't see cause I had to blink all the time and my eyes stung! Owchie! Oh, I broke my umbrella! I couldn't open the stick thing *nod* so I tried to jam it in. Then, the next time I opened it the top came off! It just all broke off! So I put it in the bin and tried to survive without it! Oh, I was a wimp going to school though and I got a lift! Hehe, that was like minimal ran compared to this evenings tsunami! Sorry I'm boring... it's just I had french and boring stuff today, oh and french homework *shivers* Euugh... bad bad bad!
