I always thought to myself that some things are better gone unchecked and all.  Besides that thing that bothered me the most was how could she shoot the guns when she doesn't have any hands.  I mean i love my wife dearly more than my last wife who oddly enough was a dear.  But she doesn't have any hands which makes some aspects of life hard but then again what is love without hardship and all.  Wow i must really be in deep thought cause as i look here i am actaully not on my farm anymore where am i must have wondered off somewhere................
