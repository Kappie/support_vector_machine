People associate it with 'being' ex: poor souls, lost soul, etc. It's like, people get so used to identifing the heart with emotions, they forget it's just a muscle. Everything you feel is foremost in your head. When people feel like they have a weight on their chest, what is that? It's a body's response to feeling sad/restricted/burdened. A soul is the essense of a person, then. As for the tastes we can't imagine... I think the soul experiences everything the person does, because the soul is always with them, part of them. Everything in your 'heart' and head combined - every emotion and trait. And then, along these thoughts, where would you be without your  essence ? I think it's impossible. But imagine, if you couldn't feel love, couldn't experience joy at a sunset, you would have a desperate soul. This is just what I think. And I'm gonna blog it, haha.
