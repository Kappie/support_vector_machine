I'll post up the lyrics here  Woke up, flat faced on a kitchen floor  With an empty bottle of JD still clasped in my hand My headache was intense, there was a sudden chill in the air  But the biggest shock that was yet to come, I was missing my underwear   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   I looked up and down, and all around  People stopped to stare  I asked everyone about it, but no one seemed to care  It's just not fair, what a nightmare  Wish I had a spare, but I don't   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   What could've happened with it?  I hear them all there laughing  Hiding myself in the dark  I hope nobody saw the skidmark   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   I was about to give up  I was about to go home  When I saw my pair of BVDs laying there by the phone  I knew that they were mine I saw that they were fine, but I was still drunk and naked  Everybody laughed and everybody screamed---   Has anyone,has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?  Has anyone, has anyone seen my underwear?   Where did it go...?
