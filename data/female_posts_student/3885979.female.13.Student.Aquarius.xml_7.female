Will you sleep tonight will you think of me? Will I shake this off...pretend its all okay? That there's someone out there who feels just like me There is  Those notes you wrote me I've kept them all I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall With every single letter in every single word  There will be a hidden message About a boy that loves a girl  Do you care if I don't know what to say? Will you sleep tonight will you think of me? Will I shake this off...pretend its all okay? That there's someone out there who feels just like me There is  Do you care if I don't know what to say? Will you sleep tonight will you think of me? Will I shake this off...pretend its all okay? That there's someone out there who feels just like me  Do you care if I don't know what to say? Will you sleep tonight will you think of me? Will I shake this off...pretend its all okay? That there's someone out there who feels just like me There is   **more songs to come later**i gotta take a nap**    peace out, meg
