I had to do a bunch of laundry because like I said, mother was upset. So I did that and then since it was so HOT, laid out outside in my swimsuit! I got some sun! A teeny bit burnt actually.. it's nice so I don't look so pasty anymore!  I'm gonna try to get something together tomorrow, don't know what it will be or who with, but at least something! Haha.  XOXO.
