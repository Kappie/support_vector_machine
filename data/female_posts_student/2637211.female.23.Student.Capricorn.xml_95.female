I felt better by the evening and was able to hang out with Jerm, but it really sucked. Pretty lame. Migraines are so weird and uncomfortable that I can barely describe them. It's like all of your senses are heightened, except for vision and touch. I get weird missing spots in my vision and sense of touch goes numb in my right hand, usually. But then all sounds and smells are overwhelmingly upsetting and nauseating, as is bright light. It's some bizarre sensory malfunction in the brain, and I just don't understand why it happens when.
