Sure, there were flaws: it could have been darker; it could have been sharper; Matthew Broderick could have been left out.  But over all, it was pretty damn good.  Maybe it's because I have yet to see the original and didn't have any of those nasty expectations going in, other than how much I knew I'd love it.  The critics seem to be so mad about its campiness and superficiality.  I'm sorry, but I thought that was the whole point.  Camp works.  Okay, so it's not a probing, hard-hitting social commentary/satire.  But there are some great fucking lines and Glenn Close is phenomenal as the perfect evil bitch.  The story's a bit weak, but the trio of Nicole, Bette and the gay boy make me want to move to Stepford and join their anti-cult.  I'm sure I'll hate it the second time I see it, but for now, I'm left coveting Nicole's great hair.  Sigh, soon.    In other news...  It's been a long-standing joke/theme/infuriatingly perfect/creepy thing that the Boy and I share parallel experiences.  Always have.  Even way back when we didn't even realize it.  It's not that the exact same thing happens to each of us at the exact same time, or that circumstances that plague one inevitably plague the other.  It's more about the more-than-a-crush we each had on our best friends in 9th grade; both loving the person for all the wrong reasons and hating them because we loved them and having no idea we were loving them.  It's the hugely epic first loves experienced across an impassable distance.  It's the knowing each respective relationship would end and knowing we would be the ones to end it.  It's the revolving obsessions.    Our timing is improving.  We've been sharing similar experiences in closer proximity, which is great for girl-talk value and for being available when one needs to hear what s/he just told the other not more than two weeks ago.  And so, when a new boy came into The Boy's life and showed promise, a part of me rejoiced for my own chances with this new girl I'd been hearing so much about.  When it appeared his promise would not be fulfilled, a part of me got worried.    And sure enough, my story shares the same highs, lows and ending.  Granted, the plot points wore different clothing, but underneath, they're the same.  To the letter.  There's not much to tell by way of details, which is basically the whole point.  There's nothing to tell because there's nothing to tell.  Nothing's happened; nothing's moved anywhere.  And while it hurt in the beginning, the wanting to find out what happens next, to become friends and see where it took us only to be met with silence or promises for later, it doesn't hurt anymore.  We haven't talked about anything; nothing's been resolved (or brought up, for that matter); we're no closer to becoming friends than we were a month ago.  Nothing's ended because it never began.  But none of it bothers me anymore.  I did my part.  I gave it a try and kept up my end as best I could.  There's nothing to regret, really, because nothing ever got to that point.  The whole "in different places" thing, while known from the beginning, becomes more and more apparent with every passing week, and it's time to put the whole thing on the shelf of good memories.    So, the Boy and I find ourselves yet again in the same place.  At the end of another short story, ready to find the first line of the next great tale.  Seattle seems like a good place to go looking.
