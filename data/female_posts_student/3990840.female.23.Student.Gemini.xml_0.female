Basically stars form when a few particles of space dust get close enough to have gravitational attraction, and once they hook up together, they have a greater mass (because there are 2 now, not just 1 atom), so they attract more particles.  This continues until there is a huge mass of particles and gas being brought together by gravitational forces.  So, the gravity makes these particles get closer and closer together, which heats them up.  Eventually, they get hot enough that when they bump into eachother, you get fusion (when two protons smack together and stick), forming Helium.  So all of the energy made by the fusion pushes out, counteracting the gravitational force, creating a stable star size.  (If fusion is never accomplished, you get a "brown dwarf", this usually happens when the total mass is less than .08 times the mass of our sun)  Eventually, the core of the star runs out of Hydrogen atoms and is full of Helium atoms (produced by fusion of Hydrogen).  At this point, there is not enough energy produced in the core to counteract the gravitational forces, so the star begins to collapse.  The star will collapse until the electrons are being forced into the same space at the same time (Pauli Exclusion Principle) so you get electron degeneracy pressure pushing out, counteracting gravity again.  As the star contracts, the core heats up even more, to the point that the Helium can begin fusion.  Now the star is called a Red Giant.  Eventually, all of the Helium (like the Hydrogen before) will be used up, and contraction will begin again.  The carbon in the core (formed by Helium fusion) will be very compressed until it 'rebounds' and pushes away all of the outer envelope of gas, which becomes a planetary nebula.  At this point fusion in the core has stopped and it gradually cools, becoming a white dwarf, roughly the same size as the earth (but with a density of a ton/cm^3).  The really cool thing, is that were Jupiter two or three times it's current mass, it would have evolved into a star, and we would be in a double star system.  Which means that Jupiter is basically a brown dwarf, a star that never had enough mass for fusion.    And that was your lesson for the day... interesting, right?  (or not)
