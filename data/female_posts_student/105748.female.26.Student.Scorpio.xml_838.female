All together now:  "Kenny Rogers? EEEWWWW!!!"  Our kids manage to get us hooked on what we watch.  I was always a trekkie, but it was Andy who got Kim watching Voyager.  And the Simpsons.  And it was Jess who got us watching The Practice and Angel (Angel looks just like her OLD boyfriend) and Friends.  Kim's also a big fan of Frasier and of Everybody Loves Raymond.  ELR (and Home Improvement before it) really do a pretty good job with husband-and-wife stuff.  And Doris Roberts is brilliant as the mother-in-law-from-Hell.  Anybody else remember her from when she worked with Pierce Brosnan in Remington Steele? Which brings us back to the start of this post.
