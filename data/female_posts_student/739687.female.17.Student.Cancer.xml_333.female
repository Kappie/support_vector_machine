Some good food, as opposed to the usual crap I eat.  I cleaned out my car today, and I found alot of old things in there...made me reminisce a bit.  *sigh*  Some scary stuff in there...glad neither of parents cleaned my car out for me.  Whew. Anyways...time to eat and then go rollerblading a bit. :) I haven't done that in a while.  Peace crazies.
