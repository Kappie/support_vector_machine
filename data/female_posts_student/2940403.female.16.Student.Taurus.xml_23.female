    
       Just finished filling out another packet about myself for my new doctor.  Another list of checkmarks, another stereotype, another prescription, another bottle of little white or light blue tablets that say do not use with alcohol, another failure. Still the thoughts remain, the grudges, the anger, the pain, the tears, the heartbreak.  I want the voices whispering in my ears to stop.  I don't want to listen anymore Having a hard time even keeping my eyes open.  Perfect circle has this effect on me.  I have nothing left to write at this point.  -fin-
