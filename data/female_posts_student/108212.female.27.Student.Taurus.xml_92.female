Grownup is more a state of mind than an age - you can tell if they're grown-ups because  (1)  they know that they can't have a healthy relationship if Mom's still number 1 ("Dr. Freud!  Paging Dr. Freud!  Your patient is ready!");   (2)  They actually  want  to have a healthy relationship; and  (3)  They won't resort to name-calling.  Whatever a "Puta" is.  Sounds like something less than a compliment.   And how did I wind up being the only one here who doesn't know Tagalog?  Daf
