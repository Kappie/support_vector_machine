Oh well im back, and im going to make a super cool, radical, gnarly layout! because its summer andthe black just aint cool no more. So, theres nothign new in my life other than... nothing. lol Its the same ald stuff with work, (except now that its summer i get to work more (whopee) but that also means more money, which is good). But you know somethign funny, during that last horrid month of school you make all these plans to hangout with people during the summer, but when summer arrives, you dont do anything! and u might even start to move away from said friends! I know this has happened to me, i used to be good friends with this girl (who will not be named for her sake and mine) and by the end we werent SUPER close but we still talked in spanish class (oops, there ijust gave it away) and we said the whole speech about how we were gonna hang out during the summer and get high or w/e. but that never happened. and ive asked her to hang out but shes allways busy with other friends (whom i cant stand). I dont get it, why do people say there gonna have this totally amazing summer, and then blow it all away? Like, dont tell people your gonna hang out with them and then dont! Just dotn say it in the first place. Anyways in other news im totally in love with htat song Jesus Walks by Kanye West. that guys got talent. and its not a bad song either. Same with All Falls Down, i totally can think of some people who fit in withthat song. but anyways, thats a whole different blog. But i have to go because ive wasted my whole morning in bed and on the computer (pluss i smell). so i will sign off and go take a much needed shower.    xoxo    -Leslee
