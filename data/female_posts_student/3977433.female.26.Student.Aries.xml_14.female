I laughed at her driving skills as we ran up on the curb to park, and I even got myself a slushie. I guess I'm getting back into my routine...which is a good thing.      This weekend I'm making plans to go out in Sudbury, and I'm sure it won't be anything but drama. Melissa and I are prepared for it, and are looking forward to enjoy the stupidity of others while we drink our faces off.       I guess I'm not about to wait for others to make up their minds as to where/when/how I fit into their lives. I'd rather not dangle in the air. So, I'm going to do what I do best, and that's getting on with my life, and not worrying about games that others play.      I hope everyone enjoys their day/evening.
