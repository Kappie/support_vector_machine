I absolutly love that place. I really brings me back to who I am and what I believe. It was the place of so many realizations when I was a camper. Now, It will hopefully be supplying me with a paycheck in a few years. If anyone wants to find me the summer after my freshman year of college. That's where I'm gonna be.
