I.e. black cannot exist unless it has white as a reference point and vice versa. That moment itself is an anomoly or part of an  imponderabilia,  a semiotic, something that can't be defined. In short it is the present tense, something that is constantly fleeting...like the anticipation before a first kiss.....That moment is...    Unity of Contradiction  And now.... is forever and tomorrow my life will be "I've felt this before"  I know it... there's a formula to get back like crack it's  "never.....as good as the first time"  like Sade it never ages  So dare me I dare you to  Live in the world of ballpoint pen no erasers no corrections in the first tense where passion meets constance where prisms split into reflictives  so breathe into me only once convince me that this  ...is enough that you are more  than this air  is forever..... is neverending and tommorrow .....it will make sense in the morning    goodnite
