I think after a month of having left it in shreds, people have stop bothering and have pretty much figured I was gone for good. Then again, you wouldn't really want to check up on anything which has been decaying for the past month.  So why the rebound and why did I come to my senses and start this blog again? Simple. I was having a down-fall. I was being itchy. I felt like something was on my back and I blamed everything around me for it. It was yet another battle against me and the voice within myself. It's ironic how we're truly our own worst enemies. Anyways, to cut the long story short; I wanted to expunge everything before and start on a clean sheet. But before I could do that or had inspiration to do so - I needed a sabbatical to convalesce.  And here I am. Back again.  But I feel like... there's really no one.  Oh well. I'd have to pray a few lost souls will drop by once in awhile and somehow fall under my charm spell which will convince them that I have the best blog in the whole internet realm. They will then go forth and spread the word about my rants, and recruit more people who will also fall for my charm. At the end of the month, I should have an army of loyal devotees all under my control. I shall then make them go forth and oogle more people and force them through to my page, and they do will be hynotized and the cycle will continue until I have everybody checking up on my site, daily, 24 hours aday, every minute and every second. I SHALL BE THE BLOGGING DIVINE MISTRESS!  BOW TO MEEEE!!  Okay. I got off-hand there. I'm nice. Really. Very very nice. Ask everyone. And I'm not an attention seeker or anyone of those things. It's all for the good of me, myself and I. My writings are for personal references. :D HONEST!  My mouth hurts. I have purple teeth. I have a huge ulcer and the brackets jab into it everytime I move my lips to the right.  This is NOT cool.
