It was de-lovely, me and paul shouted 'don't hate us' instead of 'suprise' because she had made it fairly clear that she didn't want a suprise party this year.  I don't think she minded though! everybody had a great time, and i talked a lot more with erin and sean, two of the coolest kids not of our age.  I also saw indiana jones and the last crusade twice that night, once at alex's and once at my house afterwards!! (i have a problem)  Saturday:  Mama and Daddy were picking up katie, so me n' daniel walked down to wawa for our provisions.  needless to say, we had doritos for breakfast  Sunday:  Katie's first day home, we were all vewy vewy sleepy  Monday: Christians birthday, hooray!!!  the boys were very suprised to see me arrive almost twenty minutes early (my mom wanted to get there and back to bed asap) so i got to see a roomful of half-naked boys grumble about the time of day and play videogames before the sun came up.  After being hijacked from the byers car into mrs. davies', we drove for several hours.    then there was piddles  "hi.  My name is piddles.  I am a small white dog.  I am deaf.  If you see me, please call..."  i swear, if we had seen piddles, we would have stopped, turned around, and called the number.  What i want to know is, how could piddles be addressing you on his own lost poster?  the world may never know...  When we got to the lake, the boys started waterskiing while us gals paddleboated with about 200 extra pounds ("no wonder we're going so slow" "yeah, thats why we're taking on so much water!")    While they were waterskiiing, everytime alex tried, this psyco duck snuck up behind him!!  maybe he shouldn't have been so quick to judge sonja!!  she would get her revenge later...  speakingof animals, christians dog is rediculously cute!!!! when we took periodic breaks to play nintendo and eat, the dog would curl up on my legs and fall asleep!!  after like a minute, it would go into REM or something and flip over!! AWWWWW!!  Anyway  The girls took their turn, but we started out tubing.  We are the tubing MASTERS!!!  i have the bruises and rub-burns to prove it! Me n' Jackie got major air for the day, and me n' steph both got bruised  Moira decided to conquer every thing that can be pulled behind a boat ever made, while the rest of us either chilled on shore or cheered her on in the boat.  Me and jackie sat in the front looking very Ralph Lauren.  We went back to the house and set things on fire for a while, smores, wrappers, and especially pine branches which burn like a torch for twenty seconds.    We packed up, and were just about ready to go when the sun started to set.  It was so beautiful over the water that we scuttled down to the water.   Who should we find on the dock... but SONJA!!! and about 7 of her friends.  The longer we were there, the more ducks came!!    Finially, it wasn't just sonja, but  also artur, mihail, boris, dimitriy, fillip, leonid, igor, ivan, nikolai, oleg, aleksandra, anestasiya, inga, klara, irina, lidja, natasha, nataliya, olga, and veronika.  Not to mention the abusive husband of the battered wife duck.  After they tried to attack alex, we fed them bread, or in jimmy's case, threw things at them.  The sunset was beautiful, and we had a rediculously sleepy ride home, well, at least i did.  man, its 11!!  I'll finish this post tomorrow!!  luv y'all jess
