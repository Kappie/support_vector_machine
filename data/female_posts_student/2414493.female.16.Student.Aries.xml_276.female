"Love me, love me..." Oh I need you baby. I think I missed out on that part of American pop culture.  I think it's too early to resign to bed. I won't think so next morning when I have to get up. I wonder if I'll have to compete for parking spots tomorrow since it starts at 8 for everyone. Well, I'm hoping there's seniors who park in the lot too; they won't be there tomorrow morning.   I'm happily bored, I guess you could say. I might want to find that NHS form and turn it in, but I'm not that ready for real work.   Just let school be over, please.
