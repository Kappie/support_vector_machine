But when I get there I can't get the course because my grade point average is to low. Then I we sit down a try to find solution for the problem but another obstacle gets in my way. We can get any classes for this term because classes have already started. Luck me I have to deal with the fact that all of my classes are in the same term. I tell you one thing, this is going to make for a interesting term.
