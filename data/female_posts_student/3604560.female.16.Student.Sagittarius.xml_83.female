I can use what ever word I want to describe whatever I want...so THERE! >:P (that was meant to be an evil-stick-tongue-out-face btw) My username on HPANA is Saira Mavoinë but I haven't posted anything yet so you prolly wont find me. I went back to check it and it's meaning is something along the lines of "wisdom; yearning" which is close enough. But one word is Sindarin and the other is Quenya (can't be bothered to correct it).  Thanks for the spelling tip. I would have never known and may have lived the rest of my life spelling it this wrong-ish way. ;)   Marti, what do you want for your birthday? I'm at a loss. Dunno what to get you. And don't say I dont know/I don't care coz I'm just gonna keep buggin' ya.  Namárië
