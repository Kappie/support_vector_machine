I'm aware that the recorded vocals on the acoustical  My Solution  are pretty bad because I'm trying to put the rocking chorus on an acoustical song...sorry all, it was about twelve in the morning. So the next CD is going to have revamped vocals that actually sound fitting to the song this time, rather than butchering it as I did and leaving the lackluster result on the product.  Eagh.
