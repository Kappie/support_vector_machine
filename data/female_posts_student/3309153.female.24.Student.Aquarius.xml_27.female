As Meat Loves Salt , Maria McCann   Besides being one of the most beautiful sentences I've read this week, I believe this to be true. However, I do also believe that my own secret being is never content unless she presents herself to the world, if just a bit, by allowing those who look on us, i.e. she and I, to but look at my face and immediately know exactly what I am thinking.  I am an incredibly gifted liar, though I seldom use my powers for evil. (Shut your mouths, friends. This is not the time for your contradictions.) Mostly, I spend the day trying to mask a face that never wants to be masked. I might never part my lips, wet them with my tongue and then give an utterance, yet, still I communicate volumes. I wish I were able to despise someone without always having them know it. I wish I were able to pine for a man without him  seeing  me lap him up from beneath my eyelashes. I wish I were able to mimic that blankness of face that comes quite naturally to the...slow witted. Though that is  all  I covet of them, it would be a cherished gift for a girl who is hardly ever able to be quiet...be still...where her face is concerned.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so great a thing if I didn't already take up more than my fair share of space in the universe by filling it with my invisible talk. All day, to anyone (I'm interested in) I can go on and on and on and on...and I do...with nary a breath taken to fuel the start of the next oral dissertation. So, it would be no one's loss, I think, especially my mother's, if my face weren't so very loud, revealing even the most nuanced of my mental processes.  And the older I get, the more sophisticated the language of my countenance becomes. Soon, I may as well shout out loud all the secret things I would never, ever say to the opposite sex (even those whose affection has been plainly stated). With them, especially, I never want to reveal anything so that they have no idea how much power they have over me. Even there, though, I constantly say things to counteract what they think they see--which is always the truth--by actually saying something absolutely antithetical. They cannot win.  I  win. I  always  win.  Once, a long time ago, I was caught. I was completely captivated by something a man was saying. Something truly brilliant. He was that, consistently, so every time I talked to him, I grew more and more agitated by being in a space too small to hold both our energies. And all we were doing was talking; my mind being written on by his. He had the habit of looking at me as if in private conversation, though there were always others at hand. I was addicted to those "beholdings" for a while.  Suddenly, he stopped talking and asked, "What are you thinking?"  "Nothing," I responded. I felt all manner of blushes inside.  "Surely you are thinking something...come, I must have you share it." I looked at him, begging, quite earnestly, to be released from his gaze and the answer it demanded I give him. No luck there. Eons passed. He didn't move. I had to take us forward, my face having stopped us cold.   I smiled, somehow coyly and nervously, both at once, and spoke. "I was just thinking that..." I didn't dare tell all. I did tell him some--the completely academic ideas that were flowering in my head about a novel we happened to be reading. So, yet again, I was able to rescue us from her--my secret inside being fairly gagging for him to know all my secrets. Even those supposedly buried deepest--the ones concerning him.  Later, I found out that maybe I'd only been able to keep quiet where the others were concerned. Someone present at the moment of my near unveiling told me that it seemed as if he were flirting with me because he'd said, "you have quite an enigmatic smile." Bliss, that moment. I walked on a cloud for a week. But I'd missed hearing him say it himself, I guess it was as I was scrambling to be able to articulate something not quite as uncouth as I had been mostly thinking.   My secret being, I fear, will not be waiting for any other-worldly kisses to do real damage to me. She tells all, no matter the consequences. Thrilling though it may be, sometimes, there is still more danger in this curse than amusement and I want, desperately, to get it in check before some lesser man takes advantage of the knowledge she provides him.  A few days ago, someone said that I "seemed like a house divided against herself..." Touch√©.
