Anyway holls are rubbish (they havent really started yet either!) - still hav to survive a week of this! great!  Anyway i came across a most random website today - when i clicked on a link it took me to a porn site! - all i can comment is UGH! what on earth do people do that?! Feeling a little queasy at the mo!  Anyway mum is annoying me, cos she has got the new LOTR dvd but she wont let us watch it! - to annoy her we have taken to watching the first one over and over again! - she is gonna break! lol. Anyway the sad thing is now i can quote lines of the play - for example 'natha dagar dia'! - meaning they will all die! - sad huh?  Need to go and listen to some proper music to take my mind off it! ttyl hedge
