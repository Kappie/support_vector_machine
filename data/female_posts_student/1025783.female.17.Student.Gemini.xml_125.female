How do you describe torment to it's justice? How can you ever really capture security and the presence of instability? I want to share my story with you Will you listen to what I have to say More importantly, will you care The effect of myself on people is minimal If I were to never exist the world would still spin, the lottery would continue ripping people off and you would most likely still fail your math quiz tommorow So how do we know whether or not youre missing someone? How am I supposed to tell  the story of my life If I don't even know if it's the real version The fabric of life is full of wrinkles and holes Have I just slipped through? How am I supposed to relate to this world of complexity When I find myself searching for troubles of my own A story that has no beginning No middle And no end? So I sit here, friends and foes, without a means of retaliation All I know, is my hair is still tucked behind my ears, and my lip is still being bitten All I know is that I'm here, and my life is mine to own
