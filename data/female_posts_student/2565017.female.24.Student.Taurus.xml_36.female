I had a terrible day yesterday, for the most part, especially at the beginning of my workshift in the internship. Well, I have to say that my supervisor there is good, professionally, although I don't like her personally. She has this hard side I don't like about. But I've known her only for 1 day, so...   But one thing is good about her: she makes me do things on my own, instead of not letting me, like my previous supervisor. Both have pros and cons. I'm terrified of making mistakes... when it's people's health, wellbeing and even life at stake. And I'm pretty damn insecure about what I can or can't do. But it's good to feel you're trusted to do things right on your own.  Anyway, after a terrible morning of feeling like shit, and crying, it wasn't the best first day. I felt like crying a few times at work, and, well... but i got better, once I got used to work surroundings again. And when I got home, I was tired, but feeling better.  I had to rus to computer the first thing to see if I could talk to my best friend, and yeah, we talked for a long time... it was really nice and comforting. We had a good evening. I can't believe we chatted so long.... I fell asleep right away after that, and slept well.  Today morning's been nice. It's a day off from work, but tomorrow is a double shift, and I'm going (hopefully) to watch a hernia operation at a theater, as well as prepare the patient for it, and take care of the post-operative nursing. It's going to be interesting, very educating, but also veryvery hard and tireing. And the day after that is going to be morning shift, so I think I'm just going to feel dead. lol.  this is  my work schedule:  May 19th wed: 1 pm-9 pm (evening shift) 20th thu: no work 21st fri: 7 am-9 pm (morning + evening shift) 22nd sat: 7 am-2 pm (morning shift) 23rd sun: 1 pm-9 pm (evening shift) 24th mon: 7 am-2 pm (morning shift)  and then my surgical nursing internship is done. the first proper one. there's going to be  general ward internship, maternity ward internship, psychiatric ward internship, children's ward internship, emergency room internship combined to intensive care unit internship  and others. god knows what. I'm tired to check now. but a lot of internships... a lot of practical work. I like it =)  Ok, I have got to go wash dishes now. I'll write sometime later, if I'm not dead :P
