Then, I convince the goat to let me shave its fur/hair/whatever because it's so dang hot in the bottoms of wells.  Then we splash around for a bit.  Then, assuming the slinky was an old-school metal one and not a crappy plastic one, I'd bend it into a drop-spindle and a pair of knitting needles.  Then I'd make nice mohair yarn and make a sweater.  Oh, wait, I was supposed to escape?
