I have no writing ability unlike one of my best friends, Christina, who can write perfectly about anything at any time. I have two other very close friends who come up in my life a lot. Their names are Mit (it's his nickname), and Jack. But before I get into the things with all my friends, I will talk about the smaller things in my life.  Family Dad: He favors the rest of the family, thinks I'm on the computer too much, stuff like that. Also very irritable. Mother: Mother loves me... I think. She kinda understands the importance of my beloved computer. Also favors everyone else.. figures. Brother: He is 11 years old and he is ok most of the time. Except for when he thinks I'm on the computer too much. (Wow my family is like me/computer oriented) Sister: VERY annoying. She's like always bugging me and always crying. Being 10 years old, she is the youngest so she always has to have her way. GRR.. Dogs: I have two beautiful boxers. One is retarded.. but she is SO CUTE! The other is on a diet, like the rest of my family.. except me of course. My name: Since my family named me, I'll tell you about my name. I was named Olivia for my Italian grandmother and Analise for my German grandmother. Christina likes my middle name.. she's like obsessed with Anne Frank whose name is Analise. She oddly shares a birthday with her..  !My Birthday!: My beautiful birthday is July 6, 1989! Less than 2 weeks! I'm almost 15. Maybe since I'll be older, people will give me more respect. Who knows. Christina would know, she's already 15 and doesn't let anyone forget it.  Dance: I dance. I have always danced. I love dancing. I do 4 kinds of dance: tap, ballet, jazz, and lyrical. I also compete dance. I compete tap and jazz. Every other year my studio goes to the national competition. This year it is in Las Vegas, in 2 WEEKS. I leave July 5 and get back the 12. I have 6 dances going. I hope we do good. I think we will. I have named my shoes. (yes I know I'm weird) Their names are Annie and Caprice.    Ok, now, to my life. I have lots and lots of friends. Three in particular: Christina, Jack, and Mit. At one point, months ago, the four of us were known as the US Group. After having a Civil War (also known as The Big Fight) we kinda lost the whole group thing. Everyone thought of it as a clique. Of course IT WASN'T! It was just a group of friends who had a name! JEEZ PEOPLE! People bug me sometimes. Well ok, onward. Everything got worked out with the "war" and all was good for a while. Then one day- hold that thought-  Jack is my boyfriend. I love him VERY VERY much. I won't go on about it in here because NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR IT. *sigh* But we have been going out for a good 5 1/2 months. *happy sigh, daydreams*... o yea-  Then one day Mit got on Jack's nerves. To make a VERY long story short, Jack won't forgive him. It is a mess. Jack won't talk to Mit, Mit won't talk to Jack. "Our lives are a freakin' soap opera!" - Christina. It is truly horrible. I have hope though, one of my curses-  My curses: Compassion, Patience, Hope, Faith. They haunt me.  Well it's late, so I better wrap it up. I'll be back tomorrow or so to talk about more things. Unless Dad takes away our virus-filled computer.. if he does, I will be back as soon as possible.   Bye!
