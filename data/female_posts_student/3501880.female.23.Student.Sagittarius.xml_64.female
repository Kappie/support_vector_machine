I found it funny, and it is interesting to note that the characters of Mindy and Sarah were inspired by my sister and me.   You have to have high-speed internet access and a fairly new computer to view these, though. I could only get sound on my laptop, but I could view it on my friends newer, better computer.  Enjoy.
