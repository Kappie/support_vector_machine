UGH! ok i'm letting go ....*breathe out*  well anyways i don't like blogging. i feel like i'm inferior and what ever i write makes me look stupid. i don't like my writing and then i feel like i'm graded by others who read it. they probably don't understand a thing i'm saying. i also feel like i'm taking up perfectly good blog space with my crap. i mean someone else might want my URL but they can't have it because i'm using it...well sort of.  i'm kind of in the slums lately. i'm bummed that i don't have any christmas presents for any of my friends. i'm a horrible person. i love seeing the look on peoples faces when i give them their gift. it's a great feeling to know that they're enjoying it. but sadly i only have Ambroscious' gift and part of Roma's. *sigh* i need a weekend to shop for other people. i'm a horrible christmas shopper...and then besides that people tell me they got me the perfect gift and i can't even think of anything to get them. *wah* so my goal is to give more than one person their gift before christmas vacation.   also thank you Ambroscious for the Sailor Moon episodes. i've already watched them twice and think the ballroom one is my favorite because of the "Free Dance Lessons." how controversial it all is. so after having the sailor moon get together i did some scouting and figured out that there are two versions of sailor moon. Sailor Moon R (my fav) and Sailor Moon S. anyways so the R version has wisemen and all those evil spirit characters and then the S version has the crazy glasses guy and Eugele. and to think i wouldn't have known a thing about sailor moon unless i watched the marathon in 8th grade. hooray for 12 hour marathons! anyways the reason i like the R version better is because the idea of it all is just so crazy. the thought of planets, and magic cities, and going into the future future is just so much to take in. you can see what i mean by reading the summary of it...* urlLink summary *  the moon tiara, moon scepter, or moon crystal. Take your pick, -Betso
