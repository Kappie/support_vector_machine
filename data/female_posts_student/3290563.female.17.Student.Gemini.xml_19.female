It's morning sunshine, that reminds us of the flames. Yeah, those same flames, that leave our dreams in dust.  You were the blood in my veins, but when you pulled out my heart, like a river you flowed out of me, and left me stained in my lifes water.  When you give your heart, the only way you get it back is in pieces. When you fall in love you have everything to lose. You shattered my soul and left it's jagged edges to cut my insides. All I'm left with now are blood stained memories.  *  Crimson Sky, Never Goodbye  I don't want to follow in your footsteps. I don't need to breathe the air you breathe. I don't want to stare the color from your iris, to fall into the dark endless void of your eyes.  I don't want to walk in your shadow, and I don't need to live in your light. I don't want to be born in your dreams, to live inside your nightmares, and die in your mind.  Maybe I'm just an insignificant life form, just a meager, incomplete little girl... bounded by your hypnotizing stare, imprisoned by your counterfeit charm.  Prayers of love, laced with poison. Lips of deceit, my pseudo goodnight kiss from you. Promises of faith, drowned in paraffin. Words of allure, my only salvation from the flames. Crimson Sky, never goodbye.
