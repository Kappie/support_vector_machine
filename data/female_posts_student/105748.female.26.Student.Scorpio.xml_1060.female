So far its a MOBLOG server that is not only reliable, but it is ingenius and versatile.  You can actually post a lot of pictures without paying for the service although membership does have its privileges...  I'll post more about it on another post.  I've been so busy with work and with life that I have yet post an official review of it.  In the mean time, you can peruse my Buzznet by  urlLink CLICKING HERE   PS:  I would like to contribute to your fundraising goal.  Email me okay?
