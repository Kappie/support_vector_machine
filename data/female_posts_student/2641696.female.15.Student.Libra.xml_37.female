I AM THAT WHICH YOU SEEK AND   THAT WHICH IS FOUND.   I AM AT YOUR FINGERTIPS AND   I AM EVERYWHERE.   I AM ALL OVER YOU AND   I AM NOW.   I AM ALL OVER YOU AND    I AM NOW.    I AM ALL OVER YOU AND   I AM NOW.    Honestly. Check out  urlLink The Eternal Journal  if you're a philosophical / spiritual / otherwise-strange person like me. It's serious good stuff.
