I should clarify:  I love  joking  about it, and much of my inner monologue is peppered with variations on the word, but as an actual physical entity, I absolutely hate poop.  Imagine my chagrin, then, when I walked into the womens' faculty washroom last week and found three GIANT turds floating in the toilet.  Not resting, or lurking in the the little toilet grotto at the back of the bowl, but floating just as proud as can be...so high in the water I expected them to stand up and salute.  I quickly backed out of the stall area and spent thirty seconds dry heaving into the sink.  I reeeally had to pee, though, so I did the Desperate Girl Bathroom User maneuver of closing my eyes, sticking my leg out, and kicking in the general direction of the flusher handle until the poop retreated into its murky home.  Still, I had to hover  because I was so afraid the turds would come back.  Later on in the week, I returned to the same washroom and found MORE poop; this time in chai tea-diarrhea form and accompanied by the most breathtaking stench imaginable.  All I could think of as I did the same gagging foot-flush move was... this is coming from a WOMAN.    Again, the very next day.  More crap, but it had actually migrated up onto the toilet lid, where it literally coated the entire surface in a mocha-colored poop paint.  I think Doug from Trading Spaces would have been impressed at the texturing.  Obviously, I didn't use the toilet that time and ended up doing the peepie dance down the block to the next available public restroom.    I've started visiting the washroom more out of curiosity than a need to urinate, because the horrors I've witnessed will forever preclude my going in that stall again.  Yesterday, I was not disappointed:  the crapper has now managed to get her poop ON THE WALL.  Similar to the blood streaks in the  Psycho  shower scene, there are chocolate covered splotches and drips running the length of the wall above the toilet.    My question is:  who is this impressive pooper, and should I get her some medical attention?
