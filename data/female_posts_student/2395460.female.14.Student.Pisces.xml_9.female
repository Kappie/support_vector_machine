That woman is not pulling the backside version of an  urlLink Alexandra Kerry peek-a-boo ; her skirt is just painted to look like she is. It's so unglamorously realistic, complete with wedgie and grandma cotton.   My friend MB has put together more pictures, complete with  urlLink see-thru panty rantings.    Update: Jacki has let me know that this is apparently a hoax, already debunked by  urlLink Snopes . The alignment of the underwear is far too perfect for it to be real unless each of these shots was meticulously planned and posed.
