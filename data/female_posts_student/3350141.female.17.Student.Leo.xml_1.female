"Fly From The Inside"  Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders On my shoulders All alone I pierce the chain And on and on the sting remains And dieing eyes consume me now The voice inside screams out loud  I am focused on what I am after The key to the next open chapter Cause I found a way to steal the sun from the sky Long live that day that I decided to fly from the inside  Every day a new deception Pick your scene and take direction And on and on I search to connect  But I don't wear a mask and I have no regrets  I am focused on what I am after  The key to the next open chapter  I can't escape the pain I can't control the rage Sometimes I think that I'm gonna go insane I'm not against what's right  I'm not for what's wrong I'm just making my way and I'm gone  Here's the weight of the world on my shoulders  so bye bye            MEH
