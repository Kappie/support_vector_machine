Clue1- all the waitresses are fairly hot with big boobs, though with a skank look to them. Clue2-discussion of harrassment, rapes, etc. last for over 30mins. Clue3-the bartender slaps his "package" on the bar to earn $50. Clue4-the 19 yr old waitress is frenching a 60 yr old man Clue5-you get offered $100 to go out back and have sex with mullet man Clue6-drinking is allowed on the clock only for "certain girls" age does not matter. Clue7-the bouncers really dont kick anyone out for fondling waitresses Clue8-management tells you to be more "entertaining!" screw serving them their food. Clue9-the other waitresses start saying that you think that you are too good to kiss that old guy, too good to grab his package, too good to let that guy nibble on your nips, too prude-ish to waittables.  Clue10-the waitresses leave with over $300 on a shitty night and are riding in the back of some mullet guy's car to earn another $100. Dont be fooled by false advertising of companies.  Once a ho house always a ho house.  You will get use to "entertaining the customer" or else not be scheduled.  Who cares if your customers were satisfied with witty conversation, eating food, fondling, and drinking.  It is not that simple.  It is a trap...  the money is so good.  The competition amoung girls makes having sex w/ customers seem like nothing.  No one cares about your food sales, drink sales, high % of tips- it is about the business.  I am not "too good" to do a waitressing job.  I am too good to stick my tongue down a grandpa's throat to earn an extra $20.
