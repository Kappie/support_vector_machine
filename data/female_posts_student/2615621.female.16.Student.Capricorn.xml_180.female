Katie is about to drive me fuckin up the wall with some of the worest bullshit ive ever heard..and i mean it beats all the bullshit ive ever said myself. "i like eric hart" and why did she decide she liked eric hart? hmm their conversation in a nutshell: "katie, if our school was to have a beauty pagent right now, u'd win hands down" AWW isnt he sweet. katie shows me that and said "i like eric hart, hes so sweet" WHATEVER. then i said "but u love andrew, right?" then "yeah" whatever..BULLSHIT!! i gave her this stupid story about how she doesnt need to do that to guys and how they all think she'll dump andrew for them but in all reality she liked the attention, yeah attention is nice, but not when u have a bf. her bf can give her all the attention she wants. and u REALLY dont start hopein to fuck around with ur bf and start crushin on diff guys. that just bumped nsync off the top of the lame charts. WAY TO GO KATIE!!!! hooray.   Got the chords down to Time of Ur Life. yay for me! lol ive been wanting to learn that song and well, finally i have the chords down..but it still needs some work, im not a rock star yet. lol i lost my fave pick today though. pissed me off. the only one i have like it. its one of the thicker ones, its a lot better than my medium ones. it was black and had a skull on it, lol made me feel badass hahahaha naw..the only thing that makes me feel badass is umm..i dunno, but when i find that thing i'll be sure to tell u.   I told everyone tonite i was gonna turn into a skater. hahahaha throw away all my pretty pinks for a skateboard (bam margera's pink one) and punk clothes. haha Yea..me on a skateboard..i can see that. lol execpt i gotta wait until my knee is all better to skate, so i guess i wont make any plans to star in the X-Games anytime soon. oh and by the way, if im feelin up to it im gonna throw a X-Games party hahahaha everyone should be home by then. everyone gets to come over and watch the X-Games! hot skaters!! rock on! :D but i bet no one would wanna come though...unless i gave em beer or something..haha that would work! yeah, u get my mom outta tha house and i'll let ya all crash at my house.  My next song to learn is One Thing by finger eleven.   GAWD sarah is REALLY drunk..lol she wont even remember having our conversation tomorrow i bet..oh well....lol typing while drunk, not the best thing. i tried to tell someone something once when i was a lil tipsy and he copied it and pasted it to me the next day and i had no clue what i was trying to say..hmm. but do i ever know?   *much love and the power to keep u going and going*
