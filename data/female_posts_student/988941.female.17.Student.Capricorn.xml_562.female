Went to the park with Nic and she got a lift back to her house at the end, which as you know is like 200m up the road. I got very upset, considering I had to ride 2.5km back to Caterham. Ah well, that took me exactly 6 minutes to complete the journey :D  Onto other things, I'm painting Nics bedroom tomorrow. Should be fun :) Whey! About a week ago I got my Wireless router. I can now rome my house on the laptop using the internet wirefree and not have my main computer on to do so. Merry Christmas folks.
