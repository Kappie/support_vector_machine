I got angry for no reason and took it out on them. They probably didn't even notice, which makes me even more mad. And I shouldn't be mad for that either. I'm dispicable.  Today when I went to FS I felt neglected cause I couldn't be around Dave. I shouldn't go anymore when I'm not playing, I take it personally like he's ignoring me. I know that he's playing with the other group, but for some reason I still have irrational neglected feelings. Not to mention that none of the other players like me. Except Dave and Adam, Dave cause he's supposed to, Adam cause he's been around me a lot and is used to my absolute annoyingness.  We did talk here and there to each other, but not much. And once he winked at me, but I was still irrationally mad so I just glared at him. I tried to avoid eye contact with him as much as I could unless I was glaring. I'm so despicable.  So when we got bored (we being Monica Ryan and me), we left. I didn't even say goodbye to him. What the hell is wrong with me? I simply stood up, gathered my stuff, turned around, and left. No hugs, no waves, no words. I'm so arrogant.  I still don't see why the hell I was mad at him for something he wasn't at fault for and couldn't even control. I have an awful habit of taking things out on people who are irrelevant to the situation which caused me whichever emotion. I disgust me.  And furthermore, I met another guy. Well, not really met, I already knew him, but I think I might have feelings for him. I don't want to though. I can't see myself being with him. Even with Dave out of the picture (past and present), I don't think I'd let it happen. He's not really in my taste. And he's not serious about enough stuff. He's cute and that's about it. I don't even know how I could consider having feelings for him. I don't think my feelings are serious though. I sure hope not. But it wouldn't suprise me if I left Dave only to screw myself over. I'm arrogant and selfish and dispicable like that. I think I need some time to myself for a while. Too bad I'm busy this weekend and the next week and Friday night and Memorial Day Weekend and fuck it. I just don't get time to myself anymore. I guess it's a price I have to pay for being me.  Btw, no, I won't tell anyone who the guy is. Don't pester me about it. End of story. Period.   Current Mood:  Turned Away
