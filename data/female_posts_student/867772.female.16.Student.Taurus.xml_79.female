It also happened to be the day everyone was dismissed at 10am because of a gas leak.  Why do I always miss the excitement? Shit, I'd rather be the one who inhaled too much gas, passed out,hit my head on the wall, and fell into a coma for twenty-five years than be the one who was in bed that day because her mom couldn't wake her up (apparently I wasn't even breathing.)  Oh well, maybe another day...  >:)
