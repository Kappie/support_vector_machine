Then, after school, Lyndz and I picked up Tekken Tag at EB games and played. Good times. She kicked my butt at SC II --very badly, too, but then I really kicked her butt at Tekken Tag, so 'twas "all nice on ice, all right." Last night we went to Hastings and found potential additions for our gaming group. The subjects in question are Jake Martitius and Jack... er... Mullins? They're both pretty cool folks, and they are exactly the kind of gamers we need: excited, fun, obsessed, and neat. They, of course, seem as though they would kick our butts at, pretty much, just about anything in one minute, but as soon as we will have gotten back into the gaming gear and mindset and embodied decency as matches, this should be fun. I'm excited. Driving back from Hastings, we realized that the sky was at its loftiest beauty-- more astounding than I'd seen it in, probably, years. We debated waiting until the next night to skywatch but didn't want to jeopardize our chances of ever seeing such a spectacular firmament again; therefore, we went to my house to recuperate my telescope under the decision that I'd spend the night, as she lives away from the road and on a hill-- the immaculate place to skywatch. It took us aproximately an hour or so to get everything set up and ready to go, and after much impatience, we discovered that Autostar was not going to function because the batteries I'd inserted were evidently low (even though I had honestly believed they were still brand new... time=corrosion... frustration... bad.) Anyway, we wound up utilizing the telescope manually. The latter was both a good and a bad thing. The bad perspective made me realize just how very little I remembered of what I once knew and believed to be obvious knowledge; I couldn't be a very good guide for us, as I didn't even find any of my good star charts immediately when getting my stuff at home. The good that resulted is that I am re-inspired. I need to get back into shape astronomically. Seriously.    I slept wonderfully, for a change. I didn't wake up a single time throughout the course of the night. Had good breakfast, got ready, and went back to EB games, and now I'm home, having to do some cleaning soon and then awaiting Jessica so as to crack the chemistry books together (mooooooooo!!!).  Lyndsey's parents are the newest epitomes of generosity in my book. They bought $11 worth of candy from me in less than 24 hours. Because I really need to sell candy to help me afford all state, I am eternally grateful.    On that note, I got 5/7 of my music. I was placed into the Senior Women's choir. I'm slightly disappointed... I really wanted to be in 11th and 12th mixed, but I can deal with it; I'm just happy to be going to all state (granted that I make the second audition-- Gosh, I hope I do.) Eric Nelson is the director, and although I have never had him as a director, I have been given many good reports about him. The music seems so-and-so, but I'll likely come to love at least most of it in all eventuality, I hope? I can't start studying it quite yet because Ms. Bizarth lost the sheet with the voice assignments on it; each part splits up even more. Therefore, I can't exactly study the Alto I part. There's Alto I a, b, and c on most of the music, I think. I haven't really looked at it. I suppose I could start looking at the unison Alto I parts, though.     Tomorrow is Lyndsey's seventeenth barfday. Happy day, Lyndz!!!   She had some emptry Crown (Canadian Whiskey?) bottles, and when I told her that I'd never had whiskey before, she told me to drink the last drop. Being an ignorant fool, I did so. OUCH. A drop nearly knocked me out. It burnt like crap.    This song has been in my head for a fair portion of the week. It's got a good point, too.    "What I Got"  by Sublime   Early in the mornin' Risin' to the street Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet Got to find a reason Reason things went wrong Got to find the reason why my money's all gone I got a Dalmatian  I can still get high I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot.  Life is (too short) So love the one you got Cause you might get run over or you might get shot Never start no static I just get it off my- chest Never had to battle with no bulletproof- vest Take a small example Take a tip from me..  Take all of your money and give it up to charity Lovin's what I got It's within my reach And the Sublime style is still straight from Long Beach It all comes back to you you're bound to get what you deserve Try and test that, you're bound to get served Love's what I got Don't start a riot You feel it when the dance gets hot.  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, and remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I got, I got.  Why I don't cry when my dog runs away I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot Hits that bottle and goes right to the rock Fuckin and fighting, it's all the same livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me.
