Even though I kept getting mad at the drums (I could barely hear them and I kept messing up and getting angry!) we all played pretty well, Patrick's voice sounded good, Jamie's solos were awesome. Everlasting Glow came first place, Ten Dollar Thompson came second, and Solemn Fist (RICHMOND REPRESENT!!) came third. We had a good time on stage and got to meet the other bands and give each other advice. It was pretty awesome. Except that in the band room upstairs there was a bed...WHY WAS THERE A BED UP THERE I ASK YOU!!  Anyway, takin a bit of a break this week to just relax and enjoy the sun. Tonight Stef and I will be going to see Shamble play at Tynnehead Hall (I think) in Surrey, so that'll be interesting. Salmon Festival tomorrow! Canada Day woo!! That's always fun. Too bad the Garry Point fireworks aren't happening this year...or so I hear. Narcis, Karmacanix, Second, Ether's Void (with their new bassist!) and Rally Car are all playing in the Steveston field tomorrow, so everyone come check it out, it's free! And play some games and eat some salmon while you're at it. I'm not a fan of salmon...  Next Friday, Free Parking is playing at the Stardust Battle Of The Bands Finals, and it's $7.50 with a discount card from one of the bands. Otherwise I think it's $10...but it'll be a good show. You should all go. GO!  I still have to talk to that guy about buying his double kick. SO CLOSE to getting a double kick, SO CLOSE.  That is all for now! Stay tuned!
