After Rope Course, we did our third activity that was Orienteering. Orienteering is basically about finding hidden things with the clues we have. After lunch we went for a trip to Little India. The trip really make me exhausted. At night, we have a campfire. My group presented two songs, Father Abraham and Five Hundred Miles.
