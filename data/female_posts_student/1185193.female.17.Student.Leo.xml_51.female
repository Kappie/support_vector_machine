If you're as pissed off as I am (even if you're not), PLEASE e-mail ABC telling them they made a huge mistake!    Here is the e-mail address:  netaudr@abc.com   UPDATE:   This was the response to my e-mail to ABC: _________________________________ Thanks for your note about the ABC TV Network Fall Schedule for 2004 and the show, "Alias."  The show will be returning in January 2005 at its regular Sunday timeslot with absolutely no repeats through the end of the year.  We appreciate your interest in ABC TV network programming! __________________________________  Boy, oh boy!  I am infuriated.  I was expecting an e-mail like this:  Thanks for your note about the ABC TV Network Fall Schedule for 2004 and the show, "Alias."  Due to your concern and many other viewers', ABC's plans have changed.  Alias will return in Fall 2004 at their regular Sunday timeslot.
