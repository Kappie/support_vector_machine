On first glance, it looks just like  urlLink Cargo , the male  urlLink Lucky . I was initially encouraged by the fact that there was no gadget girlie on the cover, but judging from the  urlLink  Sync Blog   entry about models wandering the halls, I'm sure it's only a matter of time. Somehow I doubt there will be any shots of dudes in Calvin Klein undies draped supine over plasma tvs.  It's all pretty standard stuff, features on tech toys that are usually marketed to males: cars, Playstations, and remote controls. Ziff Davis promises that Sync will be showing readers  urlLink how to use these products   , but nothing in the sample issue reflects their cover motto of "It's not about the stuff, it's about what you do with it."  Wait, unless the article about how to use camera phones in new ways wasn't a joke. "Carry Lots of Photos", "Take photos in a bar", "Take photos in a gym", "Get Naughty Pictures Sent To You". Wow, who knew?   What’s interesting is that women buy more electronics than men do. Even when the items are for men or for the whole family, it’s usually the woman who decides what to buy. Why then are magazines like Sync and Cargo, which are pretty much just about electronics shopping, targeting only men? The oft-quoted  urlLink  CES Study   about women accounting for $55 billion of the $96 billion spent on technology products last year doesn’t seem to be registering in the publishing world as of yet. I guess the technosexual guy will have to hope that his mother and his girlfriend won’t ignore the dog-eared pages from Sync that are in his Christmas list.
