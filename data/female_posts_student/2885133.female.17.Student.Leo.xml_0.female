Since she was sort of a social butterfly, her party consisted of old friends, newer friends, track buddies, church buddies, and sisters' friends. The guests split into three sections of her house in which the part I was at decided to create chaos. It started with the infamous prickly pear omletes. My pyromania returned (we made s'mores after swimming. My first s'more! so I learned more about American culture and how it was friendly to quasi-pyromaniacs) as I burned the little spines off and then had the joy of skinning the plant.  Amidst talks of how awful the prickely pear omletes were the last time my friend made and the slimy texture of dissected plant, we decided to make a smoothie. It's consistency was very much similar to saliva and that marked the start of a party joke. Everyone tried it, some hated it while others tolerated the neutral taste. Of course, things went downhill when one of my partners in crime decided to announce how it was like saliva. Lovely thing to say about something I worked hard to de-pricklify. Of course, boredom is sometimes the key ingredient of ingenuity or insanity so we got another prickly pear pad and blended it up with random ingredients to make... a "facial mask".  There were oatmeal and melon so it should exfoliate...
