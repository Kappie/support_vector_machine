I've been sleeping like shit lately, waking up all twisted in my blankets with my shirt wadded up around my neck.  Dreams about working menial jobs and humiliating sexual encounters with seedy men that look like shoe salesmen.  Kind of casts the morning in a tacky light, waking up from scenes like that.    So now I'm in the computer lab on campus, and I think I will go get some water and drive around in my truck listening to music until I know my house will be empty.  What a weird mood I'm in.  Not fit for human consumption.
