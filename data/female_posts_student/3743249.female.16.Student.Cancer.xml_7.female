Now, however, I think I have moved past that. My goal is to post blogs more along the lines of thoughts and writings.  Lately, the concepts of Love and Time have been pressing on my mind.  Love. I tried to define it once, but I wasn't very successful. But unlike other things that are not tangible (such as fear, hate, etc.) can be described, love is greatly different. I tried to describe it as follows:   To start, I will discuss my new stance on love. As Dray has pointed out, and quite so, romance and/or romantic love is not possible in high school. It really sickens me to see the "L" word used over and over in people's profiles when it is meerly obsession or infatuation for a short time period. I can bet that 99.9999% of them will not be together for a year or two and will most assuredly never marry. Yes, have fun in high school, but please, do not jade everyone to love. Love is not plastering their name and ":-*" all over your profile. If you truly love someone, show it in actions, not words.    And then I went on to try to define the actual sensation of love with a few examples.   Again people, how many times must I make you aware, if you keep using the word "love" it will no longer mean anything. You don't seem to get it. Especially most of you now that are just in high school. You honestly can't tell me that you really think you found your future husband or wife... and if you do, I won't believe you... because things like that just don't happen. I will try to define "Love". Love means an unconditional caring, self sacrifice (like willingness to die for the other person). Love is seeing yourself eighty years old and waking up beside the same personyour entire life and loving every inch of them as strongly as they day you were married. It's getting held up in a bank, gun to your head, knowing your last moment is near, but not being scared because he told you he loves the way you are always fearless or because she said you have always been her hero. It's the feeling like you could climb to the peak of the highest mountain and sing forever of how you feel, yet all the singing in the world could not even make a dent on how you truly feel deep down... because no one has ever created a word that expresses it. Love is realizing that if you had never met him/her, you're life would be drastically different and that you would have been missing out on so many wondrous things... it makes you feel incredibly lucky that you found them... like the luckiest person in the world. Love can never truly be defined, but I tried, and now hopefully you all can see why I really hate the misuse of the word. Those of you that perhaps have only been dating a week or a month have no earthly way of knowing it's love. They are all merely infatuations.... but don't get me wrong. It's good to date casually and find what types of people and personalities mesh well with yours, and it's good to gain friends whom really trust and care for you. To those of you that realize the importance of the word, thank you for not abusing it. As with this though, there are those few exceptions to the rule. In all you do, be wise.   It was also mainly bashing those that use the word "Love" like a pack of ketchup; all the time and lots of it... even when you don't need it. I would like to state, however, that that is just the way I view it. There is not right or wrong in love (or war). Everyone is open to his or her own opinion, and even opinions about other people's opinions, but please, do remain civil. I would like to think that we are not all heathens and renegades, with atleast a few years of grammar and english. And as I have stated before, patience is a great virtue. But also is acceptance.    Time. Sometimes I think time is just a concept devised by us humans to limit ourselves. But then other times I realize that even God himself used time. He created the world in 7 days. Most of us say to ourselves, "AH I need more time," or "Time is running out." But yet, on a grander scale, it's our own personal want. God gives us as much time as we need to do with our lives what he wants us to do.. and sometimes a bit less. Afterall, we have to become more efficient, we have to prime our bodies, for they are not ours but His. We are His children and His temple. We have everything we need, all the time we need, because He is the giver of gifts unworldly and extremly precious. Therefore, be glad for the time you have.    Until my next post, .Melody.
