I did not particularly want to announce this, but a friend recently made a similar one, and i thought it'd be nice reading for those who know me not.  You see, since the end of the AGe of the Boyfriend, i have been attempting to muster interest in other guys. This, i have done, but not exactly with results. I have crushes that go from minor, to obsessive, to "enh," within the space of a week. I have yet to reveal this to anyone of interest. I do not expect any interest to be revealed to me, either. I think I'm kind of intimidating. People notice me, but I don't need them to fall in love with me.  Also, I'm still in the depths of both pathetic sadness and pathos, although i can often rise above it. So probably, a date wouldn't be worth taking, because I'd just be all comparative and shit. So unless i fall madly in love sometime in the next few months, we can forget a romantic prom.  I do have a few friends i could go with, but the only reason would be to get a dress and get pretty, and they'd probably be at a point where they'd take me for fun, but be staring at another girl all night. Why weigh them down?  Not to mention the fact the the Schnig will probably get his new obsession to come with him. I don't want to see that. I shouldn't have to.  I don't dance much, I have no real love interest, I don't want to watch him with someone else.  If Steve-o is brave enough to state that he doesn't want to go, i can too....  2) Tomorrow, i shall attend the Anti-Defamation League Conference to Stop Hate. Expect a barrage of confusion from me tomorrow, because it's being held at a Holocaust museum.
