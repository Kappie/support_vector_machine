I personally feel that it is very important to have knowledge of values and situations that will place you in making a decision about someone's health and/or life.  Secondly, the patients should be able to feel confident that their caregiver or health provider is competent of personal values and understand that everyone's values and decisions are different sometimes and it all comes down to respecting the other wishes, thoughts, and judgments.
