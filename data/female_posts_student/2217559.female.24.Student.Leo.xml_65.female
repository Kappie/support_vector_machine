I was dealing with Mr. Dirty Dancing until midnight last night, examining the funk-shey (yes, I am spelling it this way) of his room with his wife. Crazies. Then I pass by our lounge and the whole group of movie stars etc are sitting there laughing drinking a $950 bottle of brandy and throwing money at me.  The penthouse suites who will remain nameless right now, threw $200 bucks into my pocket for simply helping them with everything.  I can't beleive this crap?!?!?!?! They have been here only 12 hours and suddenly there bill is already over a grand. Anyway, having formal tonight which I am excited about. I given Dirty Dancing a bodyguard - my friend Adam who works as sports coordinator. he's beefy and can take of the 12 year old mania. hahahah.
