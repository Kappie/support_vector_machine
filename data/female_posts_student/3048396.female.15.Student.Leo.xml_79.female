This morning was alright...until I got cramps...then I got the dropsies...spilled ketchup all over my moms shirt...hurt my knee on a walk...hurt inside seeing my Grandpa not being normal...hurt inside again when I knew something wasnt gonna happen right, which lead to crying and yeah. God this sucks. I hope tomorrows better. I almost doubt it. *sigh* Eh. I've got my period, cramps, bitchiness and all I wanna do is see Ross. Heh. Sorry all who reads this...if anyone does. Im lettin it out...*sigh* I guess I shouldn't be complaining all this but I can't really complain to anyone else cuz they'd just get pissed or something...So I'll continue to bitch here. I guess its one place I can let it all out. *sigh* I guess Im just not in the mood for anything right now except a nice SAD movie...a bowl of cookies n cream icecream and....a box of kleenexs...sounds good to me...I guess. *sigh* Maybe I'll put backdraft in now and watch it...I haven't seen it since November...when Ross was here..so yeah. Whatever. Later kids.  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  I think you already know this one.
