Even so, very little work to do, which is nice considering there is so much shit in every other class.  US History was boring, but I wouldn't know since I didn't actually go.  Instead I came home and...took a nap.  Journalism was, well...journalism.  After school I raced off to my interview and got it!  Starting this summer, I'm a Coast News intern. It seems like a really cool publication, but the editor is a young woman who sounds like she isn't out to be your buddy.  I showed her all my work, and she seemed happy enough with it.  I think I'm going to start writing a lot more news stories to get myself prepared for this summer.  After the interview, I came back to school for litmag, which was...productive.  All the yearbook kids were freaking out about their interviews for editorships.  Anyway, I drove Mela to her car and we talked for a while about everything.  She is a really great person.  So now, what's left to do?  That whole plan to get everything done is caving in, because I just don't have enough sleep in my system to do it all.  Oh well.  I'm going to go catch some TV/eat dinner...then maybe a nap...then physics.
