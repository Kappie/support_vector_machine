I want to do anything else but I know if I don't study and get my shit done it'll bite me in the ass later! lol... So yeah, oh my gosh, I thought the yearbooks would be sooo much better this year. I mean, there's some cool stuff in them but I dunno, for me there wasn't a good enough product for time time and di nero put into it. Whats with calling it the "Manual"? Why change the name of the "yearbook" now? Is Las Lomas trying to start a new fad or what? Anyways, not like anyone cares but I liked the freshman year yearbooks the best (the black ones with the collage on the side and all the quotes). It had a lot more room for everyone... not just the leadership people... The nerds like us need room too...lol...OK well I g2g finish cleaning and go to sleep or I won't get that Superculminating Poster done... I need to study some too... nighty night PS for anyone who cares Cole is sick....
