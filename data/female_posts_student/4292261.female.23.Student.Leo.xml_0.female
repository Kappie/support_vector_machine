Tons of people are waiting in line to get last minute enrollment buisness taken care of. Lots of people have had the same idea as me, to fiddle around in the computer lab until class starts. I can smell hair mousse right now. Smells nice. :P And there are members of a local baptist church registering kids to vote. I had my registration updated a few minutes ago. I was forced to register Republican, but Dubya cannot look forward to my support. I don't know yet whether to vote for Kerry, Nader, or David Cobb.  I was watching Link TV yesterday...awesome channel..so informative. It was a program called Chat the Planet where they get teenagers from two different countries, put them on video conferencing, and have them tackle a difficult topic. For this episode, teens from the United States and Australia tackled the topic of immigration. I think the most interesting part was when the Native American teen was given the opportunity to speak to the Aborigine teen. He wanted to know what the Aborigines were doing to expose others to their culture. It was also interesting to see the variations of kids in both countries.  Speaking of variation, I think that multiracial people like myself should be allowed to state that they are multiracial on the vote registrar! There's no such catagory, currently. I had to mark myself down as the dreaded "other". I refuse to mark down just Hispanic, or just white, or just Native American. I'm all three. And if I can't mark them individually, a "multiracial" catagory would suffice!  Oh well, catch ya guys later. I'm not gonna be on much later... Will head into the lobby soon and countdown until my class starts.  Adios mis amigos queridos!
