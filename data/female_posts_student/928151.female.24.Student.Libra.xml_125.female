It takes a couple seconds to say Hello, but forever to say Goodbye.   Nothing hurts more than realising he meant everything to you, but you meant nothing to him.   Moving on is simple, it's what you leave behind that makes it so difficult   I dont miss him, I miss who I thought he was   There's this place in me where your finger prints still rest... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me.   If someone you love hurts you cry a river, build a bridge, and get over it.   I miss you a little, I guess you could say, a little too much, a little too oftern, and a little more each day.   Never be sad for what is over, just be glad that it was once yours.   Here's to the men we love, here's to the men that love us... Since the men that we love, aren't the men that love us ... screw the men... here's to us.   I’m going to smile and make you think I’m happy, I’m going to laugh, so you don’t see me cry, I’m going to let you go in style, and even if it kills me- I’m going to smile.   There's a girl in my mirror crying tonight, and there's nothing I can say to make her feel alright.   You don't die from a broken heart - you only wish you did.   The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love is having to wake up.
