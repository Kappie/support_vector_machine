Grew up in a small town     And when the rain would fall down     I just stared out my window     Dreaming of what could be     And if I'd end up happy     I would pray (I would pray)          Trying not to reach out     But when I'd try to speak out     Felt like no one could hear me     Wanted to belong here     But something felt so wrong here     So I pray (I would pray)     I could breakaway      [Chorus:]     I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly     I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky     I'll make a wish     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Out of the darkness and into the sun     But I won't forget all the ones that I loved     I'll take a risk     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway      Wanna feel the warm breeze     Sleep under a palm tree     Feel the rush of the ocean     Get onboard a fast train     Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)     And breakaway      [Chorus]     I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly     I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky     I'll make a wish     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Buildings with a hundred floors     Swinging around revolving doors     Maybe I don't know where they'll take me     But gotta keep moving on, moving on     Fly away, breakaway      I'll spread my wings     And I'll learn how to fly     Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye     I gotta take a risk     Take chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Out of the darkness and into the sun     But I won't forget the place I come from     I gotta take a risk     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway    @ copyright 2oo4 Kelly Clarkson
