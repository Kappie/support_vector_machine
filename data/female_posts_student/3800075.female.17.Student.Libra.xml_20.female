Did some dinner at the mesquite place, which was only satisfactory since i didnt get my G-D pop till i finished eating, went to King Arthur.  I dont know if i liked it or not though.... Leslie and i were havin too much fun making fun of it to actually watch it- except the ice battle scene- now that was intense, am i right or am i right?  Aww it was funny.  Leslie and i cant watch movies together- whenever we do it ends up the same most the time- we laugh and make fun and the rest of the theatre cant hear over us.  Why dont they kick us out you ask.  Good question.  Perhaps it's because we work there. ha.  3 days a week for me man.  tough shit lemme tell ya.  But yeah makin fun of shit is definetly fun.  shizza havent done it in awhile.  I dont know anyone who can make fun of movies like leslie and i can- we're pros man.   After the movie Michelle and Leslie went home and adam Em and i played here for awhile and sam came a little later too.  Adam showed me how to convert MOV. files to AVI. files so now the movies i take on my dig. camera i can actually use!  i was excited.  It doesnt always work (theres always a catch) but its better than nothing.  Aww man and Emilie couldnt hear the shit adam was sayin cuz he mumbles and she interpreted it in some pretty interesting ways -hence, I'll rainbow to that. :)  Shes a kick.    Aww crikey.  I dont want summer to end.  i hate school and its my last year and i dont want to face that.  i dontwant to fill out the forms and i dont want to make choices and i definetly dont want to leave my friends! But anyhoo, this is like day 4 and 3quarters without seein nathan- weak dude.  michelle called him earlier but he wasnt home.   I wonder if he's done hangin out with us again.  Hmmm that would probably be better for me- but i dont wanna stop hanging with the kid- he's cool. Hmm i dont know what else to talk about.  Well i could talk about a lot but its rather a case of me wanting to end this conversation with myself and the net gods.  so i will.  I choose conclusion! "I'm thankful for the movie industry and the shit that they produce!" Until time Next
