Finished drivers ed, just gotta get some dumb thing from skewl and then i can take the permit test but yeah..might take a little longer than i thought cuz i hafta get last semester's report card first too..blasphemy.  Went shopping with my mom for a little bit and now im home b4 going to work but i highly doubt ill be there long tho cuz we have an abundunce today for some reason..so i'll prolly be back home and reading for the rest of the night.  I have a bit of a stomach ache but that's prolly due to the packets of sugar i ate...yumfro!
