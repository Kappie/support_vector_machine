All of the sudden hes in the spotlight again. Sine when does his opinion matter in anything? Even when he was president everyone though he was a moron. What changed? NOTHING. But anyways....i have found the way to be happy. And i am excited, as i should be. Junior year is going to be a new beginning. Im gonna get good grades and stop worrying about eerything and just focus on myself and makin my life better. Nothing can bring me down!! Im not gonna worry about guys or all the drama of school. It no longer affects me. I figured out that i can never be happy and i can never have a successful relationship with some who makes me happy if im not happy with myself first. So next year is gonna be good. Then as soon as i get out of school i will go on my road trip with chelsea. First we're gonna go to New York, then Tennessee then Georgia then florida. Maybe we'll even drive down to he Keys. Im really excited forthis year to start. Too bad its only june.....
