My feet hurt a bit too much to really write about it, but these are the basic impressions:  I have NO idea what I'm doing; interns and residents are fabulously nice and helpful; I have NO idea what I'm doing and finally - I think this is going to be fun!  If only I knew what I was doing...  :)  I'm in CCU.  That's Coronary Care Unit.  I think.  Maybe it is Cardiology Care Unit.  See: I don't know anything!  But, I made it through the day (it went by really fast!) and I'm still smiling.  Yee-haw!  We'll see how I'm feeling Wednesday night, after my first night on call...  I left my poor partner in crime (who  is  now talking to me, after an emotional - on my side anyway - hour-long talk last night; 1 of 3 so far...I don't know if I'll be able to convert the others) behind for his first night of call.  I felt almost like I was abandoning him.  He didn't have a patient yet, so was quite bored.  I had had one patient, and was clueless.  I'm hoping that by the end of the week, we'll be done with boredom and cluelessness...  It is raining outside, which is wonderful.  There'd been just a bit too much sun lately.  I miss me some gloomy days.  Have I mentioned that I'm from Oregon?  Maybe I need to invest in some sort of foot-soaking thing-a-ma-bob...  Hmmm...that sounds nice.
