It's just that I'm annoyed because I tried talking to him and it's like parang ang feeling feeling pa niya. Maybe it's just me..idk. basta bwisit tlga. i mean di naman tlga bwisit..cgro prang super nwalan na tlga ako ng pagasa. I lost all my hope of ever being friends with him. I mean i know na out of 100% is 10% lng ung chance pero since he's my classmate then mas malaki pa ung chance right? but like I said la na tlga. and it's sad..pero ok lng. it's not like he's my life or anything naman noh! like i can't live without him?! grabe nman im not that in love with his face! He's not even that cute up close, really..pero there's something in him that i like. di pla something pero khit anong gwin ko, khit na isa isahin ko pa all of his flaws, i'd still like him. so cya like ko cya..and the others? mga crushes ko lng! :) so un. i got to talk him..not really talk talk, just a few words which is so wlang kwenta! bsta kc i really feel na he is so conceited, na he thinks i still have a crush on him and that i like him so much which is true, admit, pero bat pa nya kailangan isispin un at ipakita db?? edi feeling nga! tas tingin pa cya ng tingin..myb mas less na kaysa b4 coz i don't look at him that much na since i don't wanna give him the impression thati really do like him. feeling nga tlga cya. that's all i can say... glad i had let that all out.
