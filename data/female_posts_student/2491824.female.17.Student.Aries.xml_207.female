All afternoon and evening I had the feeling I like was going to vomit. I took a nap. Woke up around 12:30 and vomited like there was no tomorrow--ok, it wasn't that bad, but you get the idea... I'm just glad that I had soup for lunch.   Sorry, for the lack of updates. I'll try to do better, I promise!...  And I will get around to resizing those drawings sometime so that my template isn't all screwy...
