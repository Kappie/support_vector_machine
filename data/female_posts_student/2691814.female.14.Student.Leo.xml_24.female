It was very funny..i was laughin so hard. Well after the bus i went over to gabby's and found Chasten and alla them there playin basketball and skateboarding. I had a really bad headache after alla that running and stuff so i went home when it was turning dark and fell asleep. Keith came in and was like stacey..get up Chasten and Gabby are outside. Well it was like 8pm and i rushed out of the house. I was cold and tired for the first 10mins but then i was havin fun. Ralph came over also and we all listened to..rap music lol.
