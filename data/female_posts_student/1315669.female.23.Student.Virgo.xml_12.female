I think i'm not able to make it one  sighz..after all the late nights..my fault...this semester is doomed. All because of HIM. Oh well..takes 2 hands to clap. It's MY fault too...I let myself get indulged in games I can't deal with.. Missed him these days. But queerly I don't wander if he's doing well.. More like I was remeinsing the days when we used to be happy together *sighs* But I think it's a good thing we aren't together anymore. Like my best fren says.. we are both hazardous to each other. I think i'm hazardous to most people... serious haha Well well! let the past be past then...I've only this holidays and i shouldn't let it run by again!
