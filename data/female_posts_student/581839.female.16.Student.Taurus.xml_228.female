ARGH. after everyone left tony's house (that's ANTOINETTE for any LAMO'S who didn't know) we went to mi cocina (ayayay!)and saw some very cute hombres. and then.. we talked in different languages and people stared at us like we were insane, but it was fun all the same. and i'm very tired. and i just.. don't.. want to deal.. with sleep.. i mean school... anymore....
