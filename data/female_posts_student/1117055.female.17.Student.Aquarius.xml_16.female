I was just reading my yearbook, and I almost cried, man this sounds cheesy, but its so true, i am so increadibly blessed to have friends like all of you.  you have no idea how happy ya'll all make me every single day.  every one of you. i couldn't ask for more awesome friends.  and now i'm going to leave you for 3.5 weeks. take notes, i wanna know what i miss. and one of you i wont see for five. i miss you already. you make me sound so pathetic sometimes.
