To love and have that love come to an end Is an unbelievable pain. To love is to marry and To be unable to marry so young leaves us at an uncertain stalemate.  Where is the point in youthful dating Is it all a game? Could it ever last?  It gives us someone to love, Someone to hold, Someone to break our, oh so delicate, heart.  Is it really worth All that is endured?
