Muckler has a very itchy trigger finger, so I expect some UFA signings without a week of July 1st, starting with the official announcement of Hasek. On my short wish-list so far, there's just Draper. He's interested in playing for Toronto, but Toronto will have to move either Nieuwendyk or Antropov for Draper, and Ottawa needs him more [and has more to offer him, in terms of $$$].  It really had to happen. I don't think any of us thought that together, Bonk and Lalime would only fetch a 3rd and 4th rounder, but I'm more focused on how to effectively fill the void that's been left without letting the team slip back into the old mold and chemistry. The two trades [however rip-offs they may be] have sent messages to current Sens players that they cannot do nothing in the playoffs, and there will be severe consequences. Finally, there's an atmosphere of accountability, not to mention $6 mil cleared in payroll.  Lalime, Bonk, have a great life. We'll always have 2003.
