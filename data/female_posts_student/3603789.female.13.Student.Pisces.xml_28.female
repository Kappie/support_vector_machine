"As unbelievable as it may sound, the combined wealth of the world's seven richest people could end world poverty. According to United Nations Human Development Report, $80 billion could pay for access to basic social services and eradicate poverty. The net wealth of ten billionaires is worth 1.5 times the combined national income of the 48 least developed countries."  That was on page six (how many pages  are  there?), so if you want to read everything else...yeah, go ahead.  It's very interesting,  I  think.
