Since blogging provides too much of a distraction to me, I have been leaving my computer at home and spending lots of time at school in an effort to up my productivity.  It has not necessarily helped so much, but I will be getting a much needed break this week, no school from tomorrow through Monday.  Well, at least there are no classes, but I will still be deeply absorbed in the worlds of Business Organizations and Evidence, not to mention a glance over or two of my paper, most likely on the plane ride home tomorrow.  It has been a bad week.  I have been dealing with a lot of difficult and unecessary anger.  I think I am finally starting to get past it, but every time I think that, it resounds upon me once again.  I am hoping that going home, and seeing my family again, will help make it more bearable.  At least this is my hope.  I think I just need to get away from New York, and law school, and everything else in my life up here.  Of course, there are unique challenges awaiting me there, such as seeing my sister for the first time after our unpleasantness of Sunday.  Plus there will be many distractions that I will have to do my best to avoid if I am to make it a relaxing, yet productive visit.    So, all of this is to say that you, my faithful readers, may be seeing precious little of me over the next few days.  I will do my best to stay in touch, and update you all on my progress back to normalcy.  It's really time to dig in now, and I know I will be able to, if I can just let go of a few things, and since I have to, I know I'll be able to.  I hope everyone who is celebrating something this week enjoys their festivities and their reflections on the meaning of the season are worthwhile.  If not, I hope you at least get some holiday time to relax and recoup.  Take care, and I'll see you on the other side, if not sooner.
