I've been inspired by many to do this aha....Ok well lately like alot of my friendships with people are getting really really good... Like recently Hannah and I have gotten so much closer and I've wanted she and I to get close for like a long time and well now it's happening!! She's so awesome!! I love you Han!! Like I threw Tabby the whoel surprise party and well Hannah and I just started talkin there and then at the whole after-party at her house I dunno things just like clicked and now she and I talk all the time and it's great!!!!! And things with Brittany and I.......well those are up and down dramas!!!! Ahhh!!! But she and I are goin GREAT right now..I mean it couldn't get much better, well yeah it could but hey we're workin on it....Little things start off small but they can get bigger but only if you allow them to....she and I are sooo much alike it's crazy!!! I trust her with my life!! I mean seriously If I were hangin off a cliff and she said grab her hand I would b/c I know that she wouldn't let me die aha anyways.....She's great..so much went around about her and yeah we had our little differences with that but I mean people!! word of advice!! Never just let things eat away at you!! Confront them and talk it out I promise it works!! She and I have talked like everything out and now we are closer than ever!!! So yeah try it....Ms.Tabby Lynn.... she is one whole nother story!! I don't knwo what I would do without her!! I tell her alllll my problems!! Mainly guy problems aha but yeah she's the greatest!!!

Right now like everything is going great guy-wise for everybody!!!! I dunno I'm having some problems but they are slowly being worked out...(Go Snoopy and Charlie Brown) hehe Hannah and Jenni!!!  OMG the only thing bad that happened today was my Uncle Bill died!!! He was like the only Uncle that I really wasn't afraid of on my dads side!!! Aha I mean I know that's bad but I mean they are pretty scary. Kinda crazy but everybody hasthose in their family....Soooo tomorrow I'm checking out of school @ like 1 I do believe so I'll have to be dressed and everything already...so yeah...
