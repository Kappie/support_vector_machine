This weekend WOULD have been their 24th anniversary.  Mom was kind of down, so we went to a movie last night.  In case anyone's interested, The Italian Job is REALLY good.  Action, humor (big time) and a plot!  So...anyway, I hate my dad right now, again.  I'm also in Driver's Ed, which is kinda rough, since today was my first time behind the wheel since at least before Les Mis, so...but I did all right, I think.  If I pass all of this, all I'll have to take is a vision test @ some county DMV (hopefully Davidson since Williamson's sucks so much) and then I will be license bound!  But it's still a little nervewracking and I want to thank you for your support, Will.  Linds, please call me when you can on my cell.  I'll check at breaks and call you back.  I need to talk to you about something.  I'll see the rest of you tomorrow @ Fridays.  I'm assuming we're going to walk over to Thoroughbred, right?  If not, call me on my cell (you guys should have the number) and leave me a voicemail.  Anyway, gotta go zzzzzzz so I will talk to you tomorrow.  See you then!  ~Z
