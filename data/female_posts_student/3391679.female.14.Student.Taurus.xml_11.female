He is in a wheel chair for the next like 6 to 8 weeks and he is hot. well he is ok but i like him. the only bad thing is he is nice to me like all the time just not when he is in one teachers classroom. my two friends like his friend and his name is steven. His two front teeth are totally jacked. Royce makes fun of him like all the time. I guess what im trying to say is guys can be mean and my life is totally messed.     today is the last day of school and  $42 of mine were stolen today. I am not going to the same highschool as my frieends and i just want to go to the movies.    I need a brak likea two week break to do nothing. After that i just want to go bak to school i have issues with summer. I need to be able to doo someething or my life goes to the dumeps but the something has to be something i am required to do. I need responsidility. Some of the responsibility has to be something i can not do and get away with. Im sauprised you read all the way down to hear. Nobody reads my blog ever.     Guys are confusilg. Signed.....The one who only knows what she wants to {and today thats not much}
