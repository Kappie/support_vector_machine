I bought stuff in A and I bought a Coach bag. It's really nice. I felt so like, rich lol. We went into like all the ritcy-titsy stores like Gucci, Louis Vitoun (sp?), Fendi, Burberry (sorry if I am buchering these stores names) and were like pointing to like the bags and stuff and goin "Oh my God! Melly I have the same one at home!" and "My friend has that bag." and "I'll have to have Daddy come pick this up for me later." It was fun.  And I got a new phone! It's really nice. It like glows blue and it's got a color screen and it's got that M Mode thing... ah... I love it. I wanted a camera phone but, I like this one.  And my dad told me that since he and Sheila wanna get a new car, I get the green 4Runner!! How funny! I'm gonna get it repainted though. Black probably.  So.. anyways... yeah.. today was Monday... nothing much to say about it really. x0x
