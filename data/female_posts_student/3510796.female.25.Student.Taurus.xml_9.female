And if they don't, they better start, or you just might have one of your henchmen kill them.   Just like "When the Levee Breaks" dominates Led Zeppelin IV, you dominate your world.  You don't have time for nonsense (it's surprising you even took this quiz) and you would love to be dictator of the world someday.   You are dark and scary, and you probably don't at all care about this quiz, if you even bothered to read your results.    urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz
