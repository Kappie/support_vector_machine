But then I realize we're about to get out of school for the summer and I'm not so great.  My summer is not going to be too great, I have a feeling.  I won't miss getting up at five thirty in the morning, sure, but there are other things about school I will miss.  I'll get to that later.  Anywho, yesterday was pretty fun.  My parents worked so I had to get ready for school on my own, but I do that anyway so it was no big deal.  Alicia gave me a ride because she didn't have early bird gym.  We got to school and it was pouring rain.  The worst part was the fact that we were towards the back of the parking lot.  I hauled ass to the front doors.  Usually we walk around and go down through the courtyard to locker bay and ish.  So, Kelsi and I went into the bathroom and checked our makeup and went to locker bay.  Then I went to geometry, boring as usual.  We're starting trigonometry and it's been pretty easy so far.  Then came speech, which was awesome!  We have to do skits about good and bad job interviews and our groups bad interview kicks ass!  The good one it just plain stupid, though.  It's crazy.  Gym sucked.  THEN I SAW HIM!!!!!!!!!!!  It's nuts.  I told him on Thursday that I think he's hot.  He was walking up the stairs behind me and I turned around and told him that he's hot.  He kind of looked at me wierd because I've never talked to him before and I was like "I'm sorry." And he blushed (BIG TIME!) and smiled was like, "It's OK!"  He said that it was OK not once, but twice!  So it was really OK.  He loves me, I can tell.  Who doesn't, right?  Then I told him the whole story after fourth hour, and he laughed.  He was at his locker for some reason yesterday and he even changed his clothes.  I'm not sure why he was there.  I didn't say anything to him, though, because I'm a dumbass.
