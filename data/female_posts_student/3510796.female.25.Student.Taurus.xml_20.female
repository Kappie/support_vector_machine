A scorching 89 degrees today.  I had to go out to the store this morning and I couldn't stand it.  The average temperature in Hawaii in July is 75!  How can that be?  I cant wait to go to Hawaii in March/April next year.  Better start saving that skrilla.   I was reading a post on  urlLink nancies  tonight about thinking a song said something it didn't say.  I have made a few mistakes like this, but my favorite one is when I thought the lyrics for  Long December  was,  "I drove up to hill side, met her sometime after 2 am..."  and it is really,  "Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 am..."   Anyway, I get a kick out of things like that.  Mostly because I'm boring.  haha.  I told Sod tonight I needed to date an athlete so I could have something to do, somewhere to go.  Someone to cheer for.  As if I don't do enough already.  Side note, I read in the paper that the head coach for the University of Michigan now wants to play IU in the opener before Notre Dame because he found out Notre Dame moved the BYU game one week before we play U of M.  Old guys acting like little kids.  This should be interesting.  But come on, IU?  Does he think IU is going to give them a challenge like the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame?  No silly comments required.    It's getting kind of late and I get to thinking of someone who is going to the 'Roo this weekend and I wonder what he is doing now.  Throwing them disc's and drinking beer.  I wish I was going to Memphis this weekend for all that.  When its all said and done, Ill post links for the reviews.  For now, I'm going to......
