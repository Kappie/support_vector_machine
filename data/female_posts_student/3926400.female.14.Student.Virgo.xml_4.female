Yay, the new girl  (Erika)  is going to play mallets for marching season! Katie doesn't have to loose precious moments of dance performance for percussion. -go new girl!- Mr. Inglis kept sending me into the room where Erika was practicing to help, as if I knew what to tell her. He had already showed her how to hold the sticks. And she plays piano so shealready knew where thenoteson the xylophone were and how to readmusic. I'll be nice to her  (there's no reason not to be)  but how she plays isn't really my problem. At least until concert season.  You know you'rea band geek when............ you write a whole entry on your blog about band camp.  Must go now though. This is the Friday that Jessie and I spend the night at our grandparents.
