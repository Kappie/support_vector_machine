The good news is they  have  brought back the case, in the high quality durable leather that Coach is known for. The bad news is that the only one I've seen (in July's American  Elle ) is  Python . Very swank, but probably not for everyone. If their handbag rules apply, then classic black will surely follow. The glamourous python case is $118. It should be available beginning in July.
