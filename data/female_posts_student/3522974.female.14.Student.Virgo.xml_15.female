We played St. Vincents and they were so dam fiesty. The umpires weren't giving any fouls so one girl from Vini's fully slapped Hannah in the face, and the ref still didn't do nuffin'. By the end of the match everyone was just like hitting everyone, it was kinda fun. Ehe. The bright side is that  good people NEVER lose . Which I kept thinking and we ended up winning, the semi's. Later that day I went to Morto's party at Pino's Pizzeria. The guy who owned the restaurant was fully having a sycho attack bcoz we were being to loud. He was like muttering thing under his breath at us. Afterwards Mel, Beth, Hannah, Gem, Lozza and I all slept at Gemma's house where we watched phone booth and then a Viva La Bam-a-thon. (excellent....that guy is soo funny). After not much sleep we ate  retarded burnt pancakes  and watched Silence of the Lambs. Which was a really good movie. Hannah was like pissing herself though. Anyway my mum picked me up and i went to my first baby shower. (not mine). The baby was soo cute and he gave me chocolate...which reminds me........I'm back. You probably didn't know i left, but i did, i got the rest of Dyl's smooshed chocolate. Any way, i just got home from church, which hannah bludged by the way. I feel sorry for joel, he must be totally freaked. Anyway...im probably boring you with my un-meaningful post ( as all posts seem to be nowadays, meaningfull) so i will go. A-du, a-du, to yer und yer und yerrrr. (hehe) Luv Casey-Mai, bloggin' off...
