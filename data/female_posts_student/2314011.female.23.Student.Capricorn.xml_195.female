       
      Missing everyone today.    It's a combination of the rainy weather (where's summer?!), skipping morning pages yesterday (might have to institute an evening pages regimen), hormones (PMS is the devil), and being far away from everyone I want to be with.    Trying to pull myself out of the funk with the Summer Mix, but it's just reminding me of good times and the people sharing them.    And really, the whole "detached" approach is a bunch of crap and is not working in the least.  Part of me is ready to jump in with both feet and let whatever may happen happen and part of me needs to make sure this doesn't get away from me before it even starts.    Sigh.
