I'm going to the pool, to relax, and get lightly crisp before the show.  I think i'll call up nicole and see if she wants to go with!  Funniest thing ever: Kate's afraid to drive to the concert because she got in a fender bender, and her hood got pushed up.  And i'm not the person to take the Bus- not a fan of drunk people throwing up on the bus- So I told her I would drive, and shes all paranoid! She's afraid of the drunk people on the road, but let me tell ya, there's always drunk people on the road, you just dont know it. Just because Summerfest is going on, doesnt mean there's any more drunk people driving!  All the people that would normally go to the bars, are at summerfest! It'll be fine I dont see the problem in it!?  oh well.  Off to get tan!
