It's still long and curly, too. I've decided that longing for straight hair is a waste of time, since there's nothing I can do about it.   Sarah, you're right. Stephen Tyler is quite possibly the ugliest man in rock 'n' roll. Except for Marilyn Manson, but then he's not exactly a man anymore, is he? Sorry I was feeling sorry for myself last night, I get that way sometimes.   What picture of me do you have on your fridge? I hope it's not my school picture.   I read part of Brave New World: Revisited while my hair was drying in the salon. God, this is a dumb book. It's anti-everything. He raves and raves about the problems our society has but he never suggests a solution. Only eighty pages to go, then I can start on Portrait of a Lady.    I know I tend to get so insecure    It doesn't matter anymore        It's not always rainbows and butterflies    It's compromise that moves us along    My heart is full and my door's always open    You can come anytime you want        I don't mind spending everyday    Out on your corner in the pouring rain    Look for the girl with the broken smile    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile    And she will be loved    She will be loved    Notes:  This is "She Will be Loved" by Maroon5. It is a very good song, at least it was until they started playing it on the radio.    Today's Resolution:  Be Happy! :)
