HOW DID YOU KNOW  Vocals: Gary Valenciano   I remember so well  The day that you came into my life  You asked for my name  You had the most beautiful smile   My life started to change  I'd wake up each day feeling alright  With you right by my side  Makes me feel things will work out just fine   CHORUS  How did you know  I needed someone like you in my life  That there's an empty space in my heart  You came at the right time in my life   I'll never forget  How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worries and fears that I had  I guess what I'm really trying to say  It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  No words can express how much I love you   Repeat Chorus
