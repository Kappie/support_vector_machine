Pretty much all last week it rained and we had storms.  Which really sucked.  I really need to get ready to go to work today and get a shower.  But I am gonna postpone (spelling) that until a little bit later.   At least I got a little bit of extra sleep today.  I slept 10 hours... which is a good thing cause I really needed it.  Yesterday getting off of work I was so tired.  Maybe it was because I worked a 9 hour shift and then an 8 hour shift within two days at Food Ave, I know that those shifts are really easy but Food can get extremely boring and tiring.  My friend that I work with, Jessica, and I scared the crap out of one of the newer guys that works there.  His name is Robert and he is pretty cool though.. if he wasn't so quiet.  But he is only going to be there for like 2 months anyways cause then he is going back up to school at Ball State.  But Jess and I are trying to get him to go and see "The Passion" at the two dollar movie theatre with us on Tuesday.  Cause we are all actually off on Tuesday.  Which is strange cause Jessica snd I usually work a lot lately.  We both have this thing where if we don't work, we ask if we can come in cause of how bored we are and that we really don't wanna be at home with the parents.   Man I really wish that I was going to college now.  I am senior and all... but, I would rather be in college.  The good thing about IU is that there is a Target in Bloomington, which totally kicks ass.  And, I can come home and work at our Target whenever I am on Christmas break, Spring Break, and during the summer.  I really liked IU's campus.  It was sooo nice.  I know that leaving all of my friends is gonna be hard though.  The majority of all of my friends are staying in Evansville and going to USI, but Ashley is going to IU and she really really wants me to go.  I don't think that my mom does though...  I think that she would rather me stay here and live at home.  But I am not gonna live here forever... so, yea.  And plus, it is only a 2.5 hour drive to Bloomington and Ashley and I can take turns driving home on the weekends and during breaks and stuff.  So I think that that would be awesome. Well, I have rambled on enough here... so...
