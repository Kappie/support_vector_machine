Learning the tango...but yeah, I guess this one girl had to go to the hospital because she fell on her elbow during one of the dips. I feel really bad for her but at the same time I can't help but laugh a little. Tango as a leading cause of death...heh, ah well.  Ashley and I are talking more. It's really cool. She's just such a cool nice person. I just love her. It's too bad she's a senior.  Marching today we did like...nothing. There were so few people there and it was just like..8 trumpets. Crazyness.  I'm listening to my Dave CD that I just searched all through my house for. I think it's my favorite Dave CD.  Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head Slip into my lover's hands Kiss me oh won't you kiss me now And sleep I would inside your mouth  Don't be us too shy Knowing it's no big surprise That I will wait for you I will wait for no one but you  Look please lover lay down Spend this time with me Together share this smile Lover lay down  Spend this time with me Walk with me, walk with you Hold my hand your hands So much we have dreamed And we were so much younger Hard to explain that we are stronger  A million reasons life to deny Let's toss them away See you and me we Lay down look see She and he By my lover's side Together share this smile Each other's tears to cry Together share this smile Lover lay down  Oh please Look please lover lay down Oh please lover lay down And you weep Lover lay down Cause it's over Lover lay down Say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover Could I love you Could you love me  Darling it's All the same  'Til we dance away  Chasing me all around Leading me all around in circles chasing me all around Leading me all around in circles Say...
