Let us recap... - Dad got to experience the thrills and excitments of French, English, Ceramics, Math, and history! - For lunch we went to fogo de chao with mom to find out that margaret got accepted into the Rome programme, and also, has spent all her money! - We went to the dad's day dance (mom chewed me out for not wearing stockings.... hooray!) which was decked out in mardi gras dec, and no one was on the dance floor! - We got our characeture done, waited in line for an hour, and the lady sucked! - We did dance on the dance floor, which was fun actually - Went home to watch the beginning of conan obrien before i passed out in exaughstion.  today i woke up late! 1030! i was so excited to sleep in you have no idea. i love sleep. we went to go see confessions of a teenage drama queen. i can totally relate. but she had so much fake tanning junk on, it looked odd. i want her hair.   Spring is just around the corner, and although i'm in lvoe with winter, i do enjoy spring quite a bit. i like the sun, and the idea of school getting out. i like the beach, and the wind, and hot summer days in france... so yes i do like spring. only three months until school is out! woo hoo! i think i'm going to start counting down.  Tonight my parents go to dinner. i hope i can convince chealsea L to come over to watch movies with me. that would be really fun. oh she could sleep over if she really wanted! we'll see. i also hope we can make a taco bell run sometime soon. and i want to go to nordstrom's rack.  shake the money tree shake shake
