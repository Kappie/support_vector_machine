Today my grandmother said I talk too much too quickly ahahaha. ALSO frau vaden wants her to come in next year and tell us stories about WWII in germany. YEESSSS its gonna be so funny. huzzah!!  so basically, for me, school is over tomorrow.  i have one last bio project and frankly i just don't want to do it.  DONT WANNA DO ITTTTTTTTTTTTT.  Chem and math blew.  The highlight of my week so far, was when I was mowing the lawn... I almost ran over two turtles.  I know what you're thinking, "O M G! Ashleigh!! You SICKO!!!!" But see I didn't run them over which was very happy.  Then I looked closer and noticed that one turtle was sitting on top of the other one, or rather MOUNTED on top of the other one.  Did you know turtles had sex?  I can't imagine it would be very exciting.  Either way I didn't watch for long because I felt like a pervert, and maybe I am. Yay! brain.. hurts  goodbye.  please will sOMEONE RSVP??? :P
