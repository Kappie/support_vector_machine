Good thing I didn't buy a shiny new raquet like I was going to.  But..one door closed, another opened. It is 12:19 AM. Late nights like this always push me into deep thought.  I am trying to get my parents to adopt a child, wouldn't that be cool? My mumsy was like "You probably wont get as much new clothes anymore..." and I was like "So?" I would rather help someone then get stupid clothes that make me look pretty. I mean seriously. I do love clothes...but it's and addiction I am trying to stop.  I do all these things to make my fit in or make me popular.  Like buying 70 dollar jeans..20 dollar lip glosses. But nothing like that will ever make me happy. It's just a trap I keep fallling into.  My sister always makes fun of me because I go into these huge speeches everyday abotu the evils of modern society. Like a couple days ago I did a speech of how some people buy clothes and they find there confidence in having expensive clothes. I was "like There are a couple people I know who only think they are cool because they have nice clothes. When you put them in wally world pants they would think they were ugly and become insecure. This is why the world is so horrible. People cannot find confidence in themselves, just what they have."  Then I went into nordstrom and buy all these clothes and my sister was like "Uh...laura, I thought you said people should do stuff like that?" and I was like "uhh..." I am such a double crossing two face jerk.  hah!  I love mocking myself.  See, what I think is that it's best to know your faults so you can change them. :)  but I don't want to be normal...I don't want to go through life just being Laura.  I want to be FANTORA THE GREAT!  Well not even that.  I just want to be Laura who tried to do good things, sometimes those things didn't turn out good but she helped out a long the way.  I could even be the girl who tried so many times to do wonderful things but they never worked out.  I would rather die trying then die sitting on a chair staring at the glare from the computer screen.  Kind of like what I am doing at this very moment.  Just peachy.  Hmm...I will post more thoughts later but I am to exhausted...
