Ok, I just forgot that card and she had to be all sarcastic about it. Getting me more and more pissed. Darn. Ooh, I heard what happened to the sec 4s. Bad bad bad. Ok, it's raining now. Dammit! It's making me feel depressed!!!! ARGH!!! Why the hell do i feel like crying now?! argh. Feeling so miserable...   ok. I was supposed to post this like really long ago but i started debating with myself about whether to post the paragraph after this and it's after effects. And after thinking back on what happened last year, i decided not to. And anyhoos, I'm still pretty moody. I give up. I shall say this once and for all:  LIZ NEEDS SCHOOL!!!
