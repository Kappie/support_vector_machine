Liz says i shouldn't date any of them and she has a good point. Cheston....i don't even see him much plus...if were ever to date...i know he'd do something with another girl and would ignore me all the time. And ryan....i love him as a best friend..he doesn't even know me that well so how could he love me. I know i can't tap into his feelings(well theres a spell for that) but anyway...i know i can't do that but....its not love. Thats just the way it works for me....no one is supposed to...u know love me here, well no guy anyway. I don't want to date anyone right now and I don't wanna be involved in a mixed up triangle thing. YA I'm screwed.
