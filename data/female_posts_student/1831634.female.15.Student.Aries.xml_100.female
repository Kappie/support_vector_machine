Of course.  =)  So I went over at 1.30 even though I wasn't supposed to go until 2 because my brother had a math class at 2.  Anyway, got there, and the first thing Lisa tells me is that Jack isn't coming until three.  I wasn't much surprised.  One, because it's Jack and he's always late, no matter what, and two, it's just too much to hope for.  Because he's Jack.  Sun.  Do I make my point?  Yes.  So I went inside, and we just bummed around for five minutes trying to figure out what to do.  Then Lisa exclaimed, "Let's make pancakes!"  So of course we did.  A number of circumstances made for our downfall:  1) Faulty recipe.  One cannot do much of anything with a faulty recipe.  But then again, we chose the faulty recipe.  Darn. 2) No ingredients.  Lisa needs to go grocery shopping.  Soon.  I think that says it all. 3) No measuring utensils.  We had to approximate a teaspoon, a cup, and a liter.  And considering not all of those are standard measurements, imagine the fun we had.  Plus Lisa kept insisting that she knew what proper pancake batter looked like, so she kept on adding in bits of milk and water when I wasn't watching. 4) No appliances.  I got to hand beat the batter while Lisa ate her Korean barbeque.  Not much fun.  I do not envy those pioneer women.  The lumps are my worst enemy. 5) Stove would not turn on.  Lisa has a gas stove.  It's a temperamental gas stove.  Oooh, boy. 6) We did not know how to flip pancakes.  So they turned out half raw, half burned.  Burned because we also didn't know how to tell when the pancakes were done. 7) No syrup.  One knows that one cannot eat pancakes without syrup.  So instead, we ate it with Vietnamese spring roll sauce.  Pretty interesting.  Then three rolled around.  It's amazing how fast time passes when you're screwing something up.  Jack still didn't come.  I anticipated that, of course.  We were supposed to go to the mall to watch Terminal, but since I didn't really want to anymore and Lisa didn't really want to anymore, either, (we were having too much fun screwing up without getting a screwed up grade for it) plus her parents had to go to the airport to pick someone up.  So when Jack finally got there at around 3.30, I was still trying to make pancakes (Lisa and I figured out that if the pancake is thinner, it's more edible) and Lisa was telling him (not so) regretfully that we couldn't go watch Terminal.  But at that time, he realized he forgot to bring money, so it was a moot point anyway.  Then we gave up on the pancakes, and Jack and I went to play ping pong while Lisa tried to save her walls from Jack's rage.  I was facing the windows, and she didn't seem to care as much for her window blinds as she did for her wall.  It was a pretty interesting ping pong game.  Jack was near the bin of ping pong balls, and since we're both lazy bums who would rather not stoop over to pick up the balls every time it got hit out of the game (which was a lot of times and quite often, to boot), he just served a new ball.  So in the end, we had about 25 balls rolling around the place and the two of us too lazy to pick them up.  So poor darling Lisa catered balls for a while.  Then I dunno, Jack got mad or wanted to show off or something, because he started hitting those Chinese hard balls.  And he always hit them across the table to my right, which is my weak side, and so I never got them and they always hit the wall.  Poor Lisa was so worried.  Plus she was trying to get a picture of us, but we wouldn't hold still.  Will post rest later, as must go study SAT now.  Btw, Yini, stop laughing at me.  I swear, you abuse my friendship so much...  =(  Meng!  I finally have another blog to read!
