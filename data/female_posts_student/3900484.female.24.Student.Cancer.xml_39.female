I really wanted to start working on my paper to be published today (had to remind you all of how famous I will soon be).  I really don't want to be at school today but Im on a mission to have all of Dr. M's files organized before next week, so that they will be ready when school starts.  Ah, the life of a research assitant.  How do I withstand the glamour? I keep forgetting to mention  urlLink the book  Im reading right now, which I assume means it isn't very captivating.  But it is in a way.  I don't know who was crazy enough to read the bible throughly enough to make up a story like the one Im reading, but then who am I to judge.  It's fiction again though, which is a nice break from the REIGN of non-fiction.  Lets see, the last books I read were  urlLink this one , and then  urlLink this one , and then  urlLink this one  I started, but haven't finished.  I also recently bought Middlesex, which I need to read before school starts.  I figure a week is enough time.
