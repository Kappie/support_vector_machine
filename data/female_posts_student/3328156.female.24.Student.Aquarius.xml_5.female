Also, my email addy from Shaw has changed...now it is monkey.girl24ATshawDOTca.  Drop me a line there to let me know that it works.   What else?? OOOHHH It's that time of year again for all those folks living in Calgary.....Stampede...the one time a year that I feel an urge to listen to Country music.  Well, not that I appreciate it as much as some others of this city, however, I think that once a year does it enough for me. It was bad enough when I lived at home and had to listen to it all the time unless I was in my room or had control of the car.    Uh...what else?? so much has happened since the last post. Both jobs are going well. On July 3rd there was a HUGE rainstorm that flooded the area where VHQ is in Garrison, so the floors are all wet there now. I am just glad that I wasn't working there at the time it happened. Starbucks is good. I get three days off starting tomorrow and I can't wait. I can bond with my sofa... it was mad for a bit because I was house-sitting and not spending any time at all with it, but I believe it has forgiven me as it let me sit there comfortably this afternoon as I was off work. I keep falling asleep on the couch with the TV on, but as you all know, this is a transition that will take a bit as I am not used to having this much room all to myself. My bedroom seems so empty these days:(.  I am thinking of having an open house sometime this summer so that people can come visit me in my new pad. Probably will be before school starts again at the end of Aug. I took a week off of work to go rafting with some friends from school and take some time for myself before I have to kick it back into high gear for a while...4 months, and then I will be (hopefully) taking a semester off so I can visit some family I have been wanting to see ever since I found out that I have little cousins out there I haven't even met.  So that is all for now, I guess. If you haven't seen 50 First Dates on video yet GO RENT IT!!! I laughed so hard at the antics which Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore pulled, and they both got production rights so there is some funny stuff put in there for all the Adam Sandler fans out there.  Take care,  Amanda
