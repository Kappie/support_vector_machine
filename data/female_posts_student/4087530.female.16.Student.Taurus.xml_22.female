Further on it is said that the toxin was pretty rare and was not traceable in the human organism. Reputedly only cooperators had access to the substance. Well those lines remind me of a two episodes longing case in one of my favourite japanese animations "Detective Conan" (does anyone know? It´s actually quite famous and popular, I guess^^").
