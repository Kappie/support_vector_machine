REALLY bored. i went to my friend's birthday party, and had to leave in the middle of it because of requiem practice.  it was fun, i thought, but japanese girl and wannabe pulled it again.  wannabe apologized this time.  how thoughtful!  tonight is japanese girl's party.  it's going to be REALLY sad.  and then i have to leave in the middle of that, too-- shebaghdad choral society performs -Faure's Requiem- tonight.  -__-;;  korean boy left on thursday morning.  well, for chicago.  i think he's on the plane right now.  EEK!  i couldn't finish his going away gift on time.  :(  i feel really bad.  that's all for now.  WAIT!  i saw *someone* yesterday (cute pothead boy)--and he didn't recognize me at first!  HAHA!  i wanted to ____ him, but he was at work.  fill in the blank for that one.;)  okaybye.
