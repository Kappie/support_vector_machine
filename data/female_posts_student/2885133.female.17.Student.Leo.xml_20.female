Considering I absolutely dislike driving, having to make quick shopping trips and basically be the errand person, I probably will be hyperventilating for the first month of being an official driver. Honestly, city drivers are so darn insane... and intracity "highways" are the home to lunatic drivers -- think traffic lights and driving at 60/70 mph.  The truly lovely part of my day: I GOT A DIGITAL CAMERA! Yep, very happy. It's tiny and cute and I'm going to bring it with me everywhere!!!  It's a wonderful day.... and I don't feel like complaining about what I was going to complain about. *smile*
