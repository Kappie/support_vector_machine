I think this is definitely a sign that computers are making serious advances in their conspiracy to take over the world. They're striking us at our collective Achilles heal: the never-ending quest for love. For arguments sake, we'll say that 'love' encompasses 'booty,' too. It's all a trap to make me increasingly dependent on the computer as a social outlet, as a means of friendly validation. They prey on our vulnerability, building their collective mindpower while we unwittingly fortify their cause."
