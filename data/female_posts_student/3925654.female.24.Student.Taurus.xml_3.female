This morning I ventured out of the Franke apartment into the pre-dawn light of 10:45 a.m. I was headed northeast to thegourmand's mecca, Whole Foods (a.k.a. "Whole Paycheck," a term coined by a co-worker of mine). En route (see? I'm practicing my French), I stumbled across the live filming of some... thing (movie? TV show? commercial?). Of course, the intersection was totally blocked off by teenage guys wearing security tee-shirts and trying to look tough, but you could get still get a good look-see at what was going on. I couldn't get close enough to see any famous people (ooo! celebs!) but I did see a lot of extras standing around in disco-era bellbottoms and fringed vests. Evidently, an empty lot had been morphed into a used car dealership circa 1974. I even got to hear someone yell, "Action!"   I didn't stay long though. I'm not one of those people who gawks and stares in situations like that, at least not unselfconsciously. Besides, I had money to throw away.   So I spent about a half hour roaming the aisles at Whole Foods, sampling black bean dip and "good for you" chocolate gooey things. I bought fennel (my new favorite root vegetable), olives, and apricots for a tart I'm going to make. I also filled a plastic container with yummy nibbles from the salad bar: cilantro and lemon tofu, chunks of roasted sweet potatoes, and those little crunchy sesame nugget things you get in bar snack mixes sometimes, among other things.   Buthere's where the half-assednesscomes in. I just couldn't bring myself to buy the rest of the stuff on my list at Whole Paycheck. For goodness sakes, I'm not even getting a paycheck right now, and the one I will be getting come September will hardly supporta Whole Foods habit. So I moseyed on down State St. to the Jewel-Osco and picked up my milk, coffee, soda, and toilet paper at the regularly overpriced city supermarket.   I was quite a sight, schlepping back home with a 12-pack of two-ply "bath tissue"dangling from one fist and a few 10-lb. bags loaded down withheavy liquidproducts(see above) in the other.But I made it backalive and now this weekend's houseguests won't have to go outside and gather handfuls of leaves to take with them into the bathroom. And later on, as I dined on my purchases,I enjoyed every last penny's worth of tofu and sesame nuggets.
