I have to say that I am sorry and if I insult anyone, tough! I know what I believe and if you disagree you can email me, however let me say you will not be able to change my mind.    I was watching a special on Tech TV pertaining to the rather large problem of people pirateing music off of the internet.  I have to wonder why people do this.  People just do not seem to understand that it is STEALING!  If you download a song for free off of the internet, rather than that forign concept called BUYING it, the people who put their time and effort in creating that make nothing, nada, not one red cent!!!  I know people who wouldn't walk into their local convienience store and steel a candy bar, but they persist in downloading tons of pirated music, movies, and games from the interenet...why?    Now, God bless the music industry, those who have downloaded thousands of stolen songs are getting sued!  GO MUSIC INDUSTRY!!! The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is persisting in suing those who are guilty of steeling.  From what I understand there will be no jail time, but monetary compesation will be sought.    Whatever your opinion is, whatever you believe about his anomaly, there will be no mistaking what I believe.  Why is it that people are comfortable committing crimes when they can commit them from the comfort of their own homes?  Why are people willing to steel if they think they're safe from persecution?  Does the population of the pirates not realize that their IP addy can be tracked, the government CAN find you, you are NOT safe from persecution,  you CAN be found and sued!!!  Get it though your thick, criminal heads, this is not okay!  ~Kristyn
