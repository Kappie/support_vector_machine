But what I see now is that the whole mess brings us some good jokes.  Today  urlLink Wonkette  alerts us to a wicked scientific document-in-sock-smuggling   urlLink experiment  which was executed by some dude in Singapore, I think.  I am still unclear as to whether this sock thing is or was actually real news, considering I believe the main conduit was the  urlLink ever-reliable    urlLink New York Post .  But hey.  In this Alice in Wonderland era in politics, who really cares what real news is anyhow?  And since we all know the Post is a total right-wing paper, anyhow, we can only assume this sock business is part of the vast right-wing conspiracy.  Oh, relax. I am totally kidding!  But seriously.  You should check out the sock experiment.  He even takes pictures.
