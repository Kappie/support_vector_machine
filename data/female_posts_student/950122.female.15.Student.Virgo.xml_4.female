I accidentaly cut my finger with a razor blade early this morning. It's pretty ironic, because my dad had just told me to be careful, then I cut myself. n_n;; I didn't tell him I cut myself though; he would probably freak out and suffer a panic attack. XD Anyway, it was sorta weird because it just surprised me. It didn't hurt much, but there was a lot of blood! >    We went to Glorietta to watch Johnny English, but ended up just walking around. My mom bought me boots! n_n I also bought some books. I saw this one book;  A Guide to Tolkien . I wanted to get it, but I decided against it. I need to save like everyone else! >
