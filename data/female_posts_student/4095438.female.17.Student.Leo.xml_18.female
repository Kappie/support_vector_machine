They upset the Americans last night and now they're playing a great match into the third game against the Swiss. They don't look good for this one unfortunately. But they're seeded 17th so they're doing better than most people expected.  Another surprise was the Australian women all-around gymnastics team making the final for the first time  ever .  The highlight of the day though, has to be the gold medal win of veteran Petria Thomas. She's played bridesmaid to Madame Butterfly Susie O'Neill and then Dutchwoman Inge de Brujin for years - she won her first individual gold in the 100m butterfly.  Blogger has been acting up all day so these entries had to wait til my eyes were tired and bleary; apologise. But it's given me time to work on my  urlLink website ; I got a brand new layout up this weekend and it's really starting to take shape.
