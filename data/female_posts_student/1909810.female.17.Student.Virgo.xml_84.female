And the only thing I really have to complain about are the damn stringed instruments.  Seriously...if you don't know where the notes are...look back to elementary school and place stickers where your fingers go.  No one will be mad.  Just play the right note or I'll rip your face off. Or something. Yeah, most of the rest of it is looking alright.  we have no rehearsals left though. Yay.  and the AP english test is on monday.  FOUR HOURS LONG. Wow. ok, I need to sleep or something.
