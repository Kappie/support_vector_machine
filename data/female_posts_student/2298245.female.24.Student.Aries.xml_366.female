As a personal aside to Mike Jackson...if you're reading this, yes it is me, Shannon Black, erstwhile Kubrick fan, and still a fan when I have the time to remember it.  I tried emailing you, but I don't know if you got it or not.  If you did, the pardon the redundancy.  If not, then you did find me, and you can use the link at the right to reach me by email, should you wish.  Until then, people, c'est la vie.
