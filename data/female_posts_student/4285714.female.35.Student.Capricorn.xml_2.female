I guess I do it so that when reality hits and it's not the absolute bottom line worse that it could have been, then I was at least prepared.  Who knows??.....maybe I am seeing far more into this problem than what is really there, maybe I am letting the little things turn into big things. Maybe I am letting my imagination get the best of me.  I'm not so sure anymore that"C" is cheating on me but at this point that's not really even important (not so much) what IS important is that I have so little trust and faith in him that I can take it to the bottom so quickly and convince myself that it's true. I  (or anyone for that matter) should have more trust in the person that they are married or commited to and it's just not there for me as far as "C" is concerned. Yep! I married "C" knowing that he had cheated on his former wife, why did I think I would be any different? I convinced myself that I was different , that he and I were soul mates and he wouldn't do that to me. Also because he felt so badly and guilty for doing his ex-wife the way that he did that he told me he couldn't even look at himself in the mirror, and that all he wanted out of life was to be happy with the person looking back at him in the mirror, he wanted to cahnge, he didn't want to be that person anymore and I believed him.  I'm growing tired really quick of how things are going in my and "C's relationship. That combined with the recent revelation of what my sister says happened while she was here, I guess I am just getting a "I don't give a shit attitude" about the future of my relationship with "C". I know that is awful an I do strongly believe in the sancity of marriage and the belief that ALL should be done to salvage a marriage but I also believe that you only get one cahnce to live your life and you don't get to do it again and you should, as well as the people around you,  at the very least....be HAPPY. Which I'm not obviously and obviously neither is "C". So why spend years or months trying to fix something that may not be fixable.  We have been growing apart for quite some time now and I don't see that changing and even if it did......how long would it last?  I felt this way during my last marriage just before we divorced and I'm starting to feel it now.  Sometimes things that have been lost in a relationship just CAN"T be found again and I really can't invision myself ever being quite the same with "C" again as it used to be. I think that at some point there is just too much that has come between you and some things you just can't get back. I wish that weren't rue but it is.  I have seen what I beleive is the real "C', the filing  for divorce behind my back on Valentine's Day before he went to Iraq and now the not speaking to me and cutting me off from his bank account, not that money is a big deal to me but the fact that he would knowingly deny my children and myself of basic ammenities shows me the kind of person that he really is and it's not something I don't think I can ever push into the back of my conscious and pretend  never happened.  "C" returned home at about 8ish last night an it was the same ole song and dance, still not speaking to me and hung out on the back of his truck drinking beer all night. I finally walked out there and asked him personally to go to the store for me (the money is all his you know and I don't have ANY). He couldn't or wouldn't even look me in the face much less in the eye. I have no clue what I have done but it must have been pretty bad. All he said was pretty much "okay" and babbled something about not having any money but he did eventually go to the store and get what I asked him to then he did his norm which was to come inside and have a few bites of whatever I had made for dinner and go into the bedroom and shut the door behind him without saying a word to anyone.  The really bad part is that I still care enough about him that I'd rather divorce him and see him happy for a change, I don't like this "C", I don't know this "C" and I don't love this "C".  more later..............................I've had enough for now  Dawn
