I always have mixed feelings, like I'm not really happy at all... but I suppose I know why.  I'm not even sure if I   am    capable of growing up or even if I am, I would much rather repress it.  I can't bear to leave childhood, yet I know that if I do not, I may end up missing out on more in life.  I wish everything could just be one-sided.  It would be easier if I never had to try to sort out my emotions.  Yesterday, I passed my driving test!  ^__^  I was really nervous and quite surprised that I passed since I know it definitely was not the best I have ever done, but I am   so    glad that I did.  The wait for actually obtaining my license was incredibly long.  It was over an hour and a half and I kept thinking about how I could be do something more productive, like reading.  (Speaking of which, I have to read a lot more for English class.)  After I returned home with my new license, I went to Jose's Mexicana Cantina with Amy and Jess R.  It was funny because we were confused over the waiters who had looked similar at first, until we realized that they did not look alike at all.  We had the special ice cream dessert that customers get to celebrate birthdays.  I know it's odd, but I   loved    the candle they put in it.  It was in the shape of a crayon and was so cute!  While we were eating dinner... Jess, as usual, scared me.  She never seems to be embarassed to do certain things in public.  She asked a waiter what "papi" meant since she had heard someone call their son that when she had thought it was what a woman was supposed to call her husband.  Then, when the check arrived, Jess wrote her brother's cell phone number on the back.  -_-;;  I'm afraid of going back to Jose's for awhile since Amy and I go there pretty frequently and Jess never does.  The waiters probably think that   I    wrote the number.  Then we went to Blockbuster and rented "The Butterfly Effect" since Jess stated how it was such a great movie.  Amy and Jess were again   joking    (I hope) about setting me up with one of the people working there.
