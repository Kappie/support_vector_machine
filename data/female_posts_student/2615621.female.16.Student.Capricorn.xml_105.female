She told him how she put me and danny in her prayer box and he informed her that him and danny had been talkin about me. but he didnt say what exactly about. i take it there were people around. anyways, now im scared to death. haha i thought maybe he would talk to danny but then again i thought he wouldnt. i esp. didnt wanna think about the things said. I know they were nothing but great things though. bailey gave me another sad story about how joe is obessed with me or something. He used to always say "its all gravy" and i always said "its all grape jelly" and well..now hes started saying "its all grape jelly" too..and when bay told someone "its all gravy" joe corrected her, like butted into her convo and said "no bailey, its 'its all grape jelly!' get it right!" it really hurt her feelings. He does it again with my own greeting..i always say "hey u!" to people and umm..he does too now apparently. I told her the next time he does it just to tell him "i know julia is cool and all but stop tryin to be her!!" lol maybe he'll stop if she calls him out on it. idk..prob not. I told her i'd start using my word "naked" again, i used to say "naked" instead of cool and we're gonna see if he says it. he prob wont cuz its stupid and she said no he prob wont cuz he doesnt like the word or something. so then i decided that me and joe are gonna make up a word and see if he uses it. i bet he will... at least he'll say good things to danny. gosh, everytime i think of him my hearts starts to beat super fast and im like "uuuugh i so want things to work out!!" and "i cant wait to meet him!" and "i'd date him right now without ever seeing him" why? cuz hes everthing ive ever asked for.The beat goes on.  ugh its frustrating. the outcome will prob not favor me. thats just my luck. i told bay that joe liked telling me about danny and if joe liked me he wouldnt wanna talk about me gettin with his friend u know. but bay said, yeah he prob wants u to get with him so he can see u all the time. ooo please!! whatever. i'll update on what was said with danny as soon as i find out!! I MISS U LAUREN!!   OH yeah, tomorrow im going to look at guitars and hopefully buy one!! yay!! and start lessons! isnt that awesome? yup sho is! lol
