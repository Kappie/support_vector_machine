I keep thinking about Wendy's (which is where I KNOW I'm going to stop for dinner on the way home, having no food of my own at home), and my stomach starts to growl, and it is very distracting.  Three more hours to go, and hopefully I can manage to make myself do some work in that time.  How I've gotten this far in law school I'll never know...
