I am jumping at the chance ASAP (I saw the review in the newspaper today and immediately told my mom: "We are going to see a movie this weekend.") because my family has gotten into the habit of going to see movies that I really want to see without me. Luckily I still got to see "Saved!", but I have yet to see "Super Size Me."  I don't know what plans everyone has next week (ie. how long VBS lasts) but if you are free next Thursday, PLEASE come and see the PA Institute voice showcase! It's a combined show for the Broadway, vocal jazz, and solo voice classes. I'll be singing two solos and a duet, at least. It's at 12:30 at the LC Auditorium. If you need a ride, call, because my parents could probably give you one.  Hope everyone has a good weekend!  "LOOK! Purple tuna!"
