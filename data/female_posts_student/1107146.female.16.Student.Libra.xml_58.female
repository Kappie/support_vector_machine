His name is Nigel, he was abandoned, and my aunt takes care of abandoned cats and stuff...well, my dad saw Nigel a few weeks ago (say before Thanksgiving) and decided to take him...he's been "rehabed" shall we say, and he's gonna be here in a few minutes. He's REALLY black and REALLY soft and REALLY little.  I hope Puss/Chloe is ok with him.
