I'm having problems with gleetv e-mail address. I will have to get back to you about blog templates, design, etc. I'm trying to get Listen to sponsor this tour. I think I first will have to promote Grito Serpentino, a neochicano spokenword and music ensemble, that will be playing next Thursday at Listen When that's taken care of, I think she will be more willing to hear what I have to say. I swear I'm going to put Vallejo, CA on the map for poetry and the arts. :)
