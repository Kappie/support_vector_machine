Sorry I guess but then again, why do I have to apologize for what I think?  Micheal welcome, Z is insane but kind and a great person to have proofread your essays but she also is well versed in medieval tortures. Look that up sometime, some of the devices are actually very efficient for what they were made for...extreme pain. Smile!
