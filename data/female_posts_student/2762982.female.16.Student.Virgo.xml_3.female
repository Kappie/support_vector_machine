YAY!! omg...our big lan is SOOO FREAKIN close!! next weekend, the 28th...ooo...i'm soo excited :) Zak made me treasurer, so I made a checking account for W007 Lan, but it's under my name till I turn 18, which is less then 1.5 yrs away :D. Brad is coming down too...I still dunno how I feel about it...I mean like, I want to see him, but I don't know how to act around him anymore...we grew apart and yeah...guess I can just see how it goes.  Soo bored..even though I'm happy, I can't really find anything to do. I've been playin CS alot, and got into a clan (cbk.Maggna :P) we have alot of fun :D got DC finally, so that's cool and been playin on the same server, so I'm now like rank 30 out of 4002 or something!! Happy about that, cause I love playin CS...so yeah...I'm gonna see if I can get a movie, probably a disney one since I feel like it.
