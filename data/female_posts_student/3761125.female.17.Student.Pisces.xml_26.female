I'm liking this a whole lot more indeed. *nods*       I'm going to orderMy Litte Pony: The Movie on DVD so I can watch it andbe filled with memoriesfrom back when I'd watch it almost every day.    So... today I went to the gym in the morning... oh man was it a hard day. I'm not sure why but I just felt totally exhausted. I'm not exactly looking forward to work tomorrow either... oh well. I'll look forward to tomorrow night. I'm going out with Kate (my sister) and another Kate. Confusing.    Also, yesterday, I got a haircut... I'm still debating whether or not I actually like it though... we'll give it a few days. I might post a picture on here or on Bolt... we will see.    I, Robot absolutely sucks by the way. It was just as bad as Spiderman 2. Not to mention the shameless advertising for Converse sneakers! There's this one part in the movie where Will Smith gets a shoebox, he opens it, close-up of the Converse logo and he says "my 2004 vintage converse!" And there are two more times in the movie when another characters asks him what's up with his SHOES. MY GOD. That alone ruined it. Yeah, I like Converse but I don't need it shoved into my face like that. I know that these days, movies do that... but couldn't they have made it more subtle? Then again, I don't like it when it's subtle either, but you don'tsee other characters ASK what they're drinking when someone's drinking a Coke or something. It just shows it with the logo facing the camera. I wouldn't have minded so much if they just showed us the shoes rather than make reference to them three fucking times.    Oh, and the movie itself... predictable, but had a good message I suppose. The point was to say we, as humans, can think emotionally; which often over-rules logic.   Doesn't make up for the rest of it.   Some art I've really been into lately: (thank you to taramcpherson.com)
