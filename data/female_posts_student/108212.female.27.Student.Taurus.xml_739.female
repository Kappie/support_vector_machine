The guy too the tire off my car then pulled the screw off and placed a red piece of rubber and poked it in the tire.  Bang! Zoom! "That will be 10 dollars please" they garage owner says.  I looked at my odometer to note the mileage on my car.  89890!  Man, I am gonna need a tune up soon.  At 90,000 miles I have to get Samantha a new timing belt and other mileage adjustments.  I drove to the local  urlLink Great Bear  for an estimate.  $495.00 for a 90,000 mile tuneup.  Gulp!  More to come... Net
