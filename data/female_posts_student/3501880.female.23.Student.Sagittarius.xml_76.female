Listening to:  "Surfing on a Rocket"--Air   Watching:  Matthew Broderick in "The Music Man"   Mood:  Ambivalent. _____________________________________  Fireflies...It's a good thing! My childhood and tween days are filled of summer nights in the backyard capturing them in my hands and watching them glow. At more sadistic times, I would crush them and smear their green, glowing goo on whoever stood closest to me.   There are no fireflies in Utah. I haven't seen them in years. So, when I spot a flurry of green flashes in the tall grasses during the early evening, a wide smile creeps onto my face that I cannot rub away.   ******  Last night, I half-watched some television for the first time in ages as I prepared notecards for my final. I happened to catch a commecial for the new Tom Cruise movie,  Collateral . I pose this question, Why do they keep letting Tom Cruise make movies?   I realize he is pretty to look at for two hours, so I guess my real question is, Why do the Hollywood producers still let Tom Cruise operate under this delusion that he  can act? Put him in a light, uplifting piece of fluff where he gets to smile a lot, slather on the charm, blow-up things, and make your $200 million at the box office...fine.   But please, Jerry Bruckheimers, Cameron Crowes, and Joel Silvers of Hollywood, I am not fooled (at least for long) that Tom Cruise is a serious actor merely by dying his hair a different color, and straining to keep the corners of his mouth to keep from smiling in order to convey intensity. Putting him in elaborate historical costume still does not detract from the fact that his eyes are completely void of emotion. And please, learn a lession from  A Few Good Men  and  The Firm , Tom Cruise is a silly-looking runner. Seeing Tom Cruise in a full-out sprint just evokes a series of giggles and the distinct realization that he runs like a girl.   Please Hollywood, let us retire the notion that Tom Cruise is an appealing screen image before the pre-production for MI:4.
