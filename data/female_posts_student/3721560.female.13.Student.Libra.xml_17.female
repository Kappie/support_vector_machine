Well, he's filling up with fluid, wich is a sign of conjestive heart faliure, and he also has kidney infections. Im soe soe miserable cause Im soe close with him. And he about died earlier, soe I've appreaciated EVERYTHING he does. I gust hope to hell that he doesn't die on me. My mom is having sugery the 26th of this month and Im scared. My moms friend's son's friend shot hmslef in the chest and is in critical condition. His sister's best friend hung herself. God I soe hatwe this place. Everywhere I turn bad stufff is happening. I feel like everyone is turning their back when I need them most. Well thats all I wanted to say soe l8er.
