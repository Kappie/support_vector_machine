Everyone played wonderfully, they were stealing pucks left and right, throwing pucks at the goal, working together.....just like the Stars i used to know and love.  My dad started calling Niko a midget mid-game because he's the shortest guy on the team and he's drastically shorter than everyone else.  Then i reminded my dad that he's the same height as Niko and he shouldn't be talking.  So anyways, Niko was awesome and he didn't turn over any pucks or whatever, i was very proud of him.  Dallas has the #3 spot still, hurrah, we're getting slowly better.  On Sunday, me, Sarah and Kristen entertained ourselves by watching Lord of the rings and making fun of it.  it was amusing yet nerdy.  We have discovered that we are the only ones home for Christmas, so thank you so much to everyone who left the state because now we're resorting to nerdy things to do because of boredom, lol.  Hey Brittany, guess what? Your Clay Aiken Dearest performed at the Dallas vs. Carolina game and you were in Boston and you missed it!!!!  And then Ralph and Razor made fun of Clay Aiken!!!  Anyways, today i had to restock my makeup supply since i was running drastically low and then i had to help my mom cart all of her presents to the UPS store to ship to halfway across the country.  Yeah thats right, she sent presents to our archrival hockey team part of the family up in New Jersey.....the Flowers.  Every frickin year they give us a hard time about how much our hockey team sucks and their hockey team rocks because they've won the Cup 3 times and we've only won it once.  Even though i love NJ to death for saving the NHL from being Disney-ified by Anaheim.....i still hate the fact that they have to frickin rub it in our faces EVERY YEAR.  Thank goodness they aren't coming to our house this year so i won't have to hear them ramble while i'm watching the hockey game about EVERYTHING Dallas is doing wrong....argh.  Don't get me wrong, i love my NJ family to death.....but they get annoying when ALL THEY FREAKING TALK ABOUT is how much Dallas sucks and why they think hockey shouldn't even be a sport down here because we're not worthy.  grrrr.  So anyways.....today was VERY boring.  Oh yeah, i got my Christmas present from Brittnee today!!!  She got me a "tape" coin purse to match my "boombox" purse.  It is soooo cool!!  Then she got me the coolest toe ring EVER, which is red and black and cool looking.  THEN she got me pink and blue socks that say "Boys are stupid.  Throw rocks at them."  She thought they were hilarious socks so she got them for me.  Dude, a thing that would be really cool for xmas is one of those things that looks like a puck hit your car and it shattered that part and it looks like its still wedged into the glass.  I've seen things liek that are soccer balls, golf balls and baseballs.  they're pretty darn cool.  2 more days until Christmas....yaay!  and now i have to go!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
