I went kayaking for the first time today, and it was very fun! I think my arm muscles may have grown slightly during the four hours at Half Moon Bay, but despite all the soaking-butt, water-up-my-sleeve, splashing-myself-in-the-face-with-my-own-paddle experiences, it was one of the best activities I've done so far this summer. Then, when I got home, I had crusted salt in my eyebrows, hairline, and in the depths of my earlobes. Attractive, isn't it? At first, Katie, who was steering in the back of our two-person kayak, and I were afraid of capsizing, but once we got the hang of paddling and all that in about four and a half minutes, we felt pretty secure. The only troubles we had were going through the dock pillars, because we got caught on a string and had to be untangled by our instructor, and during that time, Katie got attacked by a giant seaweed ball. Being in the front, I couldn't see what was going on, when all of a sudden she started screaming and laughing at the same time. Hoping she hadn't gone hysterical from all the trouble we were having steering while hooked to the string, I turned around, and she has all this slimy green seaweed in her lap. It took her nearly five minutes to get it all out, and meanwhile, I was laughing so hard, I was surprised that my fears of capsizing didn't come to life. More amusing for her, however, was when I managed to collect half the bay in my own lap, or in my "kayak skirt", which is the plastic covering for the hole you sit in so that no water comes in. When we paddled over to the beach for lunch, and I stood up, all the water either went up my stomach or down my pants, and I had a wet seat for the rest of the trip. Definitely fun, though-- I would encourage you to try it just once, and go with a good friend. That's all for today... I'll have more about previous stuff next time. Oh, and I would have pictures for you, but um... my camera.. well, it's not a great idea to take a digital camera along with you when you're kayaking, canoeing, boating, or doing anything where there's more than 10 mL of water. I'm going to need a new one... crap it all.
