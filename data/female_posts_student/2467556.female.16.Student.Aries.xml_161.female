I'm going to camp until July 23rd (which is when Ash gets Tom Tom, her car, back AND its Daniel Radcliffe's birthday in which he turns 15 and is officially legal [in my book] to have a celebrity crush on). It should be tons of fun as i am going with the gang and not that many people are going this year. I will miss you all and i hope you all live without me lol. Britt, have fun in Canada!!! Jess, have fun in OK!!! everyone else, have fun wherever you are!!!  Tomorrow i have to be at the church at 10:30am, but i'm going to the World Market at 9am or so, so i can get my nutella for my sack lunch we have to take with us. hurrah for nutella!   cheers!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
