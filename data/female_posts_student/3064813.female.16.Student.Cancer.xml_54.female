Different in the way that instead of vomiting all over everything, I only FEEL like vomiting over everything.  And... nausea gets to the point, eventually, where it would be BETTER to just fucking barf than be all NASTY and queasy the rest of eternity. So, anyways.  I stayed home from school sick today.  My parents had to practically tie me down to the bed, because I kept trying to get up for the bus (for once).  WE HAVE NOW ENTERED THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  It was bizarre, but I'm (sort of) glad I stayed home because ooooooh man did I feel gross.  I slept most of the day and had really weird fucking dreams about "piggy bastards" and random things like that.... It was interesting. In totally unrelated news... I feel very bad for Josh, because he has a severely defective girlfriend (me).  I'm grounded, therefore rendering me pretty incapable of doing anything... and then the day I CAN do something I have the NERVE to go and get myself sick.  Yeah... feel bad for him.  But maybe it's just my negative amounts of self-esteem talking.  I dunno.  Let's forget about it right now, and move onto happier, less self-mutilating subjects.  (This is all very sad because I like him very much). Anyways.  I can't spell anymore.  This Texan air is a BAD INFLUENCE and is making my brain cells melt. Oh, hey!  I'm going CRAZY!  I'm getting paranoid, and it's kind of fun.  Rar, I need to not miss Geometry again.  Daniel's gonna try to kick my ass in math whenever I go back to school, and I'll LAUGH at him.  Stupid asshole.   Haha, it was kind of funny.  I was going ballistic during lunch on Tuesday, and Jill and Johnny were freaking out.  Apparently I am never violent and never swear and they can't IMAGINE me going nuts and kicking people in Health class (which I did) and cussing the neighborhood kid out (which I did) and generally making people weird (which I do).  I thought it was amusing. Yarr.  Well.  Need to turn the music (or muzzak) on again, because I'm going CRAZY.  I need a hug.  Yarr.  Read the ninth grade yearbook again today.  I cried.  It was stupid.
