Another feeling of sourness feel my heart...after readig a fren's blog...Dunno why???Confusion In my mind and heart...No one just seems to understand...Haiz...sitting down and sighing away..becoming more and more old...Hmmz...he msg me again...same old topic again... Why can't just let go of the past and lead a better life...but u chose to dwell on....and kept blaming...This will only bring hurt and pain to the pplz who care for u...The bringing up of all the past will only make me remind of those unhappy moments...Yearn so much for a peaceful life...Heart is so wounded and shattered...Haiz...Want to cry out loud but dosen't seem able to be...dunno la...So much things happening...whatever...Still have to put up a brave front in front of pplz...being hurt so deeply...I't tired...Just want to take a break...away from all these unhappy things...=( Leave this place Far Far away...Haiz...It's only a dream...
