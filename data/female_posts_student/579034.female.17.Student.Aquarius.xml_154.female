Like we been watching "The Great Gatsby" in English and yeah the acting isn't too great but the love story between Daisy and Gatsby is like.. its awesome. Like, I'm rooting for the 100% even though I know how the book ends. I just can totally feel how Gatsby feels. He wants to re-create something that happened so long ago and it kills him cause he knows very deep down that it's not gonna happen. I dunno... I just really miss Mick I guess. Like, when we are together, it's like... its endless happiness. Like we can't get enough of just bein w/ eachother... we get so used to eachothers company and then we have to say goodbye and I tell myself to be strong... but I just get lonely without him here.... like, I can deal, which I have no choice about, but... theres that side that trues to be strong and not miss him as much as I do but then there is that other side that can't help but wish this was our house, our kitchen, our livingroom, our bedroom, our life... and I know being 17 that sounds realy gay and obsessive, but this isn't obsession, it's just me missing my boyfriend... mom doesn't exactly help either, "You should really look for someone out here." "There are plenty of guys on Staten Island if you just look." Yeah right, who is she to talk when her boyfriend lives in Brooklyn and her last boyfriends lived in Jersey. But yeah.. enough rambling.. sorry if I bored you x0x
