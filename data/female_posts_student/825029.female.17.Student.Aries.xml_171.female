I do not believe that I "earn" grace from God, but that I can pass that love on to others through good deeds and "works".  After all, how can anyone call themselves a Christian if they do not try to emulate Christ?  And Jesus spent his life serving others.  Ephesians 2:8-9 references good works to say that we should not use outward actions to "boast" to others in order to make people think we're better people.  Grace comes from God and our faith in Him... yet our faith in Him should then lead us to serving others through good works.    "What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?  Can faith save him?... faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead... You believe that there is one God.  You do well.  Even the demons believe- and tremble!...by works faith was made perfect...a man is justified by works, and not by faith only... For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." James 2:14-26  (didn't feel like typing it all out)  As far as predestination/free will, I believe God has his plan for us all laid out, yet we choose whether or not we follow that plan.  Just felt in a religious debate kinda mood, and this is supposed to be my "outlet" or whatever, so there ya go!  Have a good day-  Things are better.  Lissa
