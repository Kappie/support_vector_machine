The mark line is actually really cool. i wanted to order some stuff for myself, but i have to say no- it's for the customers...or should i say, "clientelle". i get this make-over kit to take to mark parties and other mark events. i never thought i would get into this, but this actually pretty awesome! im so excited! they gave me this cool tote to carry around mark stuff, and i get prizes for points. Mark is open to girls in highschool and college, but im sure older ladies can do it too. it's so fun! for more info, go to www.meetmark.com
