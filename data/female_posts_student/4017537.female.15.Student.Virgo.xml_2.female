There are a few valuable pictures there.Especially thepictures from the party Katie, Danielle, Francesca, Nadja ,and I went to. No one's online now. Keems went to the mall, Nate and Courtney went to the concert, and Jason is at a reception with Katie. I would listen to music but for some reason, the computer is being spooty and won't let me. I've started having dreams about school again. I always start having dreams about school a month (at least) before it starts. Unfortunately, school will be starting the exact day of my  birthday!  It isn't fair. That night, I have band rehearsal. At least I won't be totally alone. Sara will be there too. Sara and I really need to do something. I haven't seen her since school has been out!!! I was in Europe for 3 weeks, Pennsylvania for one, I've been at my dad's, and I've been at my grandma's, so we haven't been able to do anything. Last time we tried, it didn't work out because Sara got the job at McDonald's. Congrats, Sara. I hope you can rake in the dinero so you can get me a job and chauffeur me around. Haha. You know you will be. I haven't been able to see any of my friends, though. It sucks. Don't get me wrong, though... I do NOT want to go back to school just to see my friends again. I'm just not like that. Jason, Katie, and I might go to the zoo tomorrow. That should be fun. Last time we tried to go to the zoo, we got rained out. I think I'm going to go play some pool. Adios, mis amigos!
