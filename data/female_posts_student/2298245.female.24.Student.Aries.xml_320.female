There are volumes and volumes of scenario's sitting around somewhere that have every imaginable Trojan Horse plot. The question is, how much of that could have really been acted upon?  Can you imagine the reaction if the President said on August 5, 2000, " we have reason to believe that terrorists will use commercial aircraft as terrorist weapons. We don't when, where, or which airline, but we wanted you all to know this concern ."  Ok, thanks for that.   I was just having this conversation yesterday with the lovely ladies of my study group.  To me, as I've said before, I find it perfectly legitimate to look into what was known.  It would have been great to have prevented 9/11, and the more we look into intelligence failures and communications problems then the greater chance we have of fixing the problem and preventing it from happening again.  But so far, I have seen no evidence that it could have been prevented at all.  Nothing close to it.  There seems to be nothing more than a vague, uncollected and unconnected series of facts and theories and opinions and hypotheticals that say very little about specific plans at specific times and specific places.  Instituting general warnings on the basis of what was available would have been foolhardy, as Mr. Devine persuasively points out.  And even if there was enough information available to prevent it from happening, all that information was not put together, and had it been, it would probably have been too late at that stage to do anything about it.    This is all symptomatic of what I like to call the Hindsight Syndrome.  We all think we know best, and we all see how obvious it was something was going to occur after it has already happened.  But I tend not to buy into this. At the end of the day, even if everything was done right, something could still have gone wrong.  There are any number of variables that go into each single daily occurrence, and there is no way to know even what all of them are, not even after the fact.  Is intelligence a problem we should be working on?  Yes, of course.  I'd rather not get blown up on the subway at any moment, and most people I'm sure feel the same way.  Does this mean I think the political blame game currently going on is appropriate?  No, I don't.  I think it's foolish and unnecessary to engage in such discussions and debates.  Planning for the future is more important than dwelling on the past anyway.  These distractions are endless and unhelpful.  And while I am on the subject, I am equally appalled at the attempts by those on the right to foist blame upon the Clinton administration.    But I know better than to ask for more, especially in an election year.
