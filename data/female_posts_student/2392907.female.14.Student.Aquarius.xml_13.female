"I am indeed," Nazrene giggles approvingly. "Aw come on man, share!" says the guy, trying to grab Nazrene back. "You made me do this..." James pulls Nazrene back and whacks the guy around the head. Nazrene smiles proudly. A crowd has started to form around them. "OI!" yells a blonde. "That's my cousin!" "Oh my God, is that Hilary Duff?" somebody says. Hilary flicks back her hair and says smugly, "The one and only." "I don't care if you're Hilary Duff or some tramp with a dog who wants to steal frappuchinos! This has nothing to do with you," says Nazrene, rather annoyed that Hilary stole her thunder. "What do you mean it's got nothing to do with me??? My cousin just got whacked because of you!" Meanwhile, James and Hilary's cousin are snarling at each other. "Well then it's between him and James! You have no right to be involved. Why are you even arguing with me?" "Hmph. Because." "Because what? Cos you're a celebrity?" "No!" says Hilary, aware that half the partay is watching her. "Because... erm..." "Attention seeker." "UH!!! Man eater." "What??? Ignorant cow." "Loser." "Moron." "Freak." "Wannabe." "Slut." "BITCH!!!" And thus, Hilary receives a giant slap across a cheek. "Aaaaahhh!!!" yells Hilary, who unwisely decides to jump onto Nazrene. Nazrene chooses to go for the hair, while Hilary blindly attempts to scar Nazrene with her fake nails. We are afraid the rest is --censored--
