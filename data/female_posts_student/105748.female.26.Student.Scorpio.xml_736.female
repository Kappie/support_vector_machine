I guess we'll take  After the Fox . ;-)  Have you all seen  XXX  yet?  Brian has.. He saw it the night before our wedding.  I haven't, though.. Perhaps we'll rent it when it comes out on DVD rentals.   High Fidelity  was really good.  We saw it when it came out in theaters.  Thought it was hilarious!  Brian loves Jack Black!  I love John Cusack.  He has another really good movie with Minnie Driver in it.. Here's a trivia quiz for you.. Can anyone name it?    Daf, so glad to hear that you're going back to school.. I plan to go back to school, too --- someday!  Good luck to you!
