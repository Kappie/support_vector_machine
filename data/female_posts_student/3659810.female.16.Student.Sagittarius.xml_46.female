In class last term we talked about how those who don't conform get cast out, for me it is the opposite, if i were to conform i could kiss my 'friends' goodbye. I would be so very alone in this world, i would never get invited anywhere, never would i feel needed... hmmm sounds like my life now.... maybe it wouldn't be such a change after all, maybe for me conforming is just another choice that leads to the same outcome.
