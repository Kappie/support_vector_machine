I wished he could've stayed longer, but I had no idea when my mom was going to be home and he had to leave soon but...it was good, I'm glad I got to spend time with him.  We drove out to Cheshire to Sweet Claude's 'cuz he wanted a milkshake. I didn't get anything, and paid. I figured it was okay, 'cuz he was spending the gas money to get his ass out here an hour.   *sigh* Now I'm alone again. I think I'm getting a pedicure, and I'm definetly cashing my paycheck.   ...3
