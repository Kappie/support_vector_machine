And the paper thats waiting to be written isnt going to be it.  I need something. I need someone.  I need .s.o.me.t.h.ing. else.  Fuck it. I cant pay attention.  I need more drugs. I need more pills.   --> "And dont say no to pills."   This song could be my anthem.  I'm not sure if I'm proud of that fact.
