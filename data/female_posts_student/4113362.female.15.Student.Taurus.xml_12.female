Etymology: French, literally, sabbath, from Latin sabbatum: a midnight assembly of diabolists (as witches and sorcerers) held especially in medieval and Renaissance times to renew allegiance to the devil through mystic rites and orgies.   Now. Firstly, I would like to express my..emotions towards Brandon. Our friendship is currently on hiatus.    Main Entry: hi·a·tus  urlLink  Pronunciation: hI-'A-t nounEtymology: Latin, from hiare to yawn -- more at  urlLink YAWN 1 a : a break in or as if in a material object :  urlLink GAP   Colton> b : a gap or passage in an anatomical part or organ2 a : an interruption in time or continuity :  urlLink BREAK  b : the occurrence of two vowel sounds without pause or intervening consonantal sound .  That is for you, my un-educated friends.  Brandon, is a boy. Brandon is a boy who says I'm annoying. And that, is totally and completely understood.  HOWEVER,  I do not appreciate him saying "I don't like how you are. I wish you were different" and not having any suggestions as to how I could improve myself. Because you know, my main goal in life is making Brandon happy. I will be  God's second hand man.- Curtass   I miss Jonathong. I also miss Spencer. One of you better come home soon...  Also..  I'm sick of everyone thinking Stephy and I are whores. Although it's not so much thinking we're whores..as it is that 'whore' is the only word that their uneducated minds could come up with to describe the fact that we aren't the same.  Whore:  1 : a woman who engages in sexual acts for money : PROSTITUTE; also : a promiscuous or immoral woman 2 : a male who engages in sexual acts for money : avenal or unscrupulous person    People really shouldn't be so judgmental, and if they are to judge us they should really know the definition of the words they are using. I wasn't aware that I engaged in sexual acts for money, nor was I aware that I wasn't a virgin.  I'm sick of everyone assuming things about me, and Stephanie, and more so our friendship. I am not a bad influence on her, nor is she one on me. In truth, none of you even take the time to get to know us. Why cant you even try to get to know us? Is it that difficult for you?   You hate us because we are different. Would you like it better if we changed the way we are and were the same as all of you? Everyone always has a problem with the way we are, because we are different, they refuse to let us in on what they would like us to be, if you don't like the way we are maybe you should make yourself damn clear on how you want us to be, before you start trying to mold us, you stupid ignorant bastards.   You all completely contradict yourselves, always. Every one of you always put in your stupid profiles that you "respect individuals, and people who strive to be different," Bullshit you do. /You say that becuase it's a fad. Same with your whole "I am bi-sexual" Bullshit you are. You tell us you are in an attempt to be accepted and 'popular' but that's a whole other story isn't it? Stop trying to change who we are. This is us. If you don't like it maybe you should go and find some new friends. I don't need any of you to tell me how to be, I am happy being who I am. I do not need any of you; maybe you should all re-think your opinions and your judgmental views. Stop looking to other to please you, and relying on other to make your life okay and complete. With such high standards, you will never be complete and you will never be okay; I can assure you that one day you will realize that everyone is different. I can assure you that when your life catches up to you, no one will respect you, they will reject you, just like you did us. You will have spent all your Highschool years trying to conform to what you thought was "normal".    Highschool is only three years of your life. After Highschool is over, we'll be in University, driving our Porche, because we got out there and expressed our feelings and opinions, instead of conforming. And maybe I'll see you boarding the city transit system, on your way to your trailer trash life. Maybe you should start seeing through your own eyes, instead of everyone else's. In closing, stop being so ignorant, and selfish, because its going to get you nowhere, and really everything you don't like about us, is exactly what you are. You are selfish, and have no regards anyone else. You are opinionated, and more so stupid. We are just as good, if not better than EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.  Thank you.  Also, I still love Stephanie:) She isn't hated yet. Curtis..you aren't hated either, as with you dylan..and garrett, you not either. also....hmm..spencer? and bruce. and maybe brian. But the rest of you. burn. burn hardcore.
