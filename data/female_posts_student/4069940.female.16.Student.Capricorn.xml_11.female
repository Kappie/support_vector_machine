Needless to say, if any of my friends need to talk in the middle of the night, or they just plain get home late and feel like saying hey, I'm the one they call.  Tonight is no different.  It's 1:50 am, I'm chillin, not tired in the least, and with nothing to do.  I always ponder late, this time of night, why people are sleeping?  Is it because most of my friends have to get up ad go to jobs (which I don't have), or is it because we are supposed to sleep at night, (that is what God intended)? I'm not sure, but for whatever reason, I'm the only one awake here at my grandparents house.    Sitting here in the computer room that I have sat in so many times before, I start to think about the wonder that children are.  I guess it is something that all children are born with.  The ability to make anything fun and exciting.  Something teenagers and even adults of today can not grasp.  I remember so many times that my cousins and I would sit in this room for hours on end, playing with a barbie or reading books.  Now I look at it, and all I can focus on is who is going to be online in the time I am allotted before my little brother gets his turn to serf the net.  I wonder why I can't have simple fun anymore.  I can't tell you how many times a week I catch myself or one of my friends saying "What are we going to do tonight, I'm bored", then I realize that what seems like just a few short years ago, we would have been yawning and asking for a story.  Back in the old days when things were simple, and you didn't worry about what you were doing in a month, a week, a day, an hour from now...You worried about if your dad was going to pick out the right barbie at Christmas, and if your mom was going to remember to get your favorite shirt when you went to grandma house.  You were satisfied with a plastic car and a few barbies, and you didn't need anything electronic to keep you occupied.  I wish things were like that now days.  I wish I could be occupied for hours with simple things, and never worry what tomorrow was going to bring.  I wish I wasn't so caught up in my "love story", or what is going to happen "next time I run into so and so who's going to beat my butt...blah blah blah".  I wish life were simpler again...Actually, right now, I wish I could fall asleep...
