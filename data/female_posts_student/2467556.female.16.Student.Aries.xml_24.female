Not really, i just slipped and said something i shouldn't have.  I was trying to convince Jess that she NEEDS to go to the Jesuit vs. Coppell game and Tom was there too.  Well, usually i use the "hot guy" speech on Jess to make her go and i forgot for a SPLIT SECOND that she was newly un-single so i said "Do you know how many hot guy----yeah nevermind, i'm leaving now".  I was sooo embarassed because i forgot!  I need to call her and apologize.  Oh man what if i do that to her after she's a newlywed, lol! jk, Jess i'm sorry! *tear* i wish i had a boyfriend.  I have a few options, but i'm not going to push it or anything.....i like to be friends with guys before i just run off and date them.  Tom and Jess look so happy together!  I'm so happy for them.  Tom is a cool guy, so i completely approve of this relationship.  Also, in my computer class today, me and Kate were trying to convince Mr. Phillips to get highlights in his hair and then let us give him a makeover to go clubbing in.....in exchange for a 100 on a test, lol.  He was all like "I'd rather appear conservative in the workplace" and i said that being conservative is boring.  Liberal with your clothing and hair all the way!  lol, jk.    Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: Me and Lauren didn't see him in the lunch line today, but we saw him at his table.  ugly brown fleece jacket again.  argh.  We thought he was wearing beige tennis shoes (ew!) today, but upon closer inspection, they were normal light brown, which did match what he was wearing.  He was wearing a bright red shirt with yellow lettering that brought out the color in his pale skin.  Now if only he didn't have that jacket, he would've had a wonderful outfit.....he needs a jean jacket.  oh well.  2 days until Stars game!!!  AND WE MIGHT GET PASSES TO MEET THEM!!!!!!  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Because Jess' Dad is all friends with somebody's wife on the team and Andy Moog and some other people....so he's got the hook-up-izzle.  Omg, if i meet Niko Kapanen, my life is complete.  well besides the going to college and getting married and having a family bit.  but yeah!!!  And yeah meeting Mike Modano would be cool too.....but thats kinda Britt's dream, lol.  aaaaah i'm sooo excited!  I've decided that the song by Don Henley called "All She Wants to do is Dance" is so my song.  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~
