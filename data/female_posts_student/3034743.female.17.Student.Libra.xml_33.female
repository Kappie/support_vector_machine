We watched a movie in computers, cuz we couldnt use the computers cuz they were needed to do testing. I asked Mrs. Parker to go to my locker...yeah, I was gone for 50 minutes. I spent that time with Holli and Theran in their 3rd period class since they just have leadership. It was fun. Then Ben came in, so him and Holli were talking...and that left me and Theran. We just talked about various stuff, but it was fun. In math, lunch, and psychology I shared some really good laughs with Erin. We have too much fun together over nothing, it's crazy. Oh, in physics I started a class discussion involving sam and his sexual orientation....so that was interesting to say the least. I didn't think it would catch on with the whole class and everyone would get involved. I felt somewhat bad for Sam, but then I didn't. I dont know. I think I may have annoyed Holli today...not too sure. I think it started when I tried to turn the situation around on her. Sometimes I think she takes things just a little too seriously. Like today when me and Theran told her we were going to be physics partners, and that I was going to ditch her, she believed me. I don't know if she is just really gullible or if she honestly thinks I would do something like that to her, because I wouldn't....she should know that too. Oh well, I don't know. Hmm...that was pretty much the extent of my day. There wasn't really anything to it. Just a little boring with a few funny moments thrown in describes it fairly well.
