Yeah I feel my stomach starting to expand actually - kinda scary thought and tommorow I have ANOTHER dinner thing to go to.  Ben and Melissa came over for Christmas Eve and we opened our presents that night and we had like a ginormous dinner.  Like EWWW though, how do people drink Eggnog, that stuff should be like illegal it's so nasty.  They should call it holiday Gagnog instead and whoever came up with the idea with putting dyed fruits in a cake was really messed up.  Fruit and cake don't mix!  So yeah then Ben and Melissa came again today and we had a HUGE breakfeast and ate junk and chocolate ALL day.  I thought my food was going to come up after dinner too.  I didn't realize I was full until after I finished eating.  Actually I felt like I was 5 million times way too full.  Too much food intake.  Too much food and junk intake ALL week.  And I have to eat a huge dinner again tommorrow out in Cochrane at Jim's place (Ben's mother's Boyfriend).  And well I liked all my gifts, but of course my sister was being her fussy little self and always complains about what she gets and stuff.  You would think since she is older she would appreciate things more but whatever.  I am not her and we are two entirely different people so I really shouldn't be on to judge.  Anyways here's the list of the stuff I got for Christmas:          -XBOX -Watch -Hello Kitty charm for my charm bracelet -New Diskman -Blue cord purse from Gap -Clay Aiken CD -Socks cause it's not Christmas without an article of clothing -Lipgloss -Pen with my name on it (lol) -Birthstone Ring -Money -Gift certificates to HMV, The Body Shop, and La Senza -Chocolate and mints -And five extra pounds from all the junk I've been eating          I also updated my portfolio.  I didn't realize I had so many talents.  I didn't really that I AM REALLY SMART, and all this time I didn't pay attention to all the awards I have for like a million different things.  I am talented in the academic area (well I try REALLY hard) but I still call that talent, and I have tons of sports awards, and lots of music stuff too.  I am multi-talented.  I didn't even realize it.  And I totally forgot about the Winter's Eve dance, I don't think I mentioned anything about it in my blog ever.  It was really fun that night and I do think I look sexy in my dress.  I love it, but well since I gained some weight it doesn't look as good on my now but well I am still hot in it.  I don't care what anyone else says cause I like it!  That night was yes VERY fun, but I am way to lazy at the moment to go into the story of that night cause that would probably take about five hours to explain the night.  I don't have the time or patience to write for five hours.
