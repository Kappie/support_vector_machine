You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go. And when things start to happen, don't worry. Don't stew. Just go right along. You'll start happening too.  OH! THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!  You'll be on your way up! You'll be seeing great sights! You'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights. On and on you will hike and I know you'll hike far, and face up to your problems whatever they are. Step with care and great tact and remember that Life'sa Great Balancing Act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left. And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed!  (98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)   KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!  So...be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Brayor Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea, you're off to Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So...get on your way!
