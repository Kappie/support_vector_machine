The chocolate hidden scene is funny too.  Even people who haven't seen Zelda would understand this, so have fun.  Doo doo doo doo doo doo DOO doo DOO doo doo doo!  http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=105053     HERE ARE THE LOCATIONS FOR THE HIDDEN SCENES IF YOU CAN'T FIND THEM.  DO NOT LOOK FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE SCENES YOURSELF.  DJ Luke rocks the house: click on the t-shirt of the man holding the flower Chocolate: Click the Ganon plushie a few times
