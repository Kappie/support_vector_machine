So i went to SCMI this past week...let me tell you...it was amazing(well most parts, but i'm only gonna divulge the good stuff) I got to hang out with Russell, Andrew, Tanner, Shalea and Tony again so that was cool.  I ALSO met Lindsey Jo, and Jesse. So i've got tons of awesome friends.  I got to know Logan better, along with his friend William and Thomas. so it was AWESOME  anyways we played in the concert and i was fantastic. At least *I* thought i was.   (i'm making Mid-State next year too!...NAVY!)  -pink
