Watching:   Nothing, again...working on Case comment     Mood:   Bittersweet (symphony?)    I suppose that today was the last day of school for those in K-12, cause the streets were littered with wandering children! Seriously, I am from Utah (otherwise known as the child-producing capital of the Western Hemisphere!), and have never seen a sight like this. I mean, if you drive by schools in Utah, you would see hoards of children, but the children in this town were nowhere near any schools. They were just wandering in large packs along main highways. I felt like I might hear the sound of David Attenborough in my head, quietly explaining the migratory patterns of these children.   I near ran my car through a group of these children, not through any negligence of my own (I swear, I have had Torts, so I know!), but because the kids in this town have a strange habit of hanging out in the middle of the street with complete disregard for on-coming traffic. They are like cattle on some country road in Bolivia! Really, I hope the rest of the summer isn't comprised of me trying to dodge children on the streets with my car.   I just got back from my appointment with my therapist. This is the second time that we have met since my old therapist left (oh! How I miss her...). I guess I just need to build more of a rapport with him, cause he does that goddamn technique where he just stays quiet, and of course, I get uncomfortable with a silence of more than 3 seconds, so I just start rambling even more until 15 minutes later I make the conscious decision of not talking until he says something! I hate when people do that...manipulate me into taking with their silence. Boo...
