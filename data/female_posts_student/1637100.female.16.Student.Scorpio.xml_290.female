[we all wished you were there mush!] after that, my family, the dukes, the cautivars, and jez went to boston pizza for celebrating zack and zay's bday. it was fun. one of the waiters was gay. so we think. yay for him. =S after that, we went home. now i am home. i was on the phone, but now i am not. i think im gonna bring the ps2 up to my room tonight. im mentally debating whether i should or not. to stay up late or not to stay up late. that is the question. and since i have nothing else to say, and this blog, being like many of the other ones i write, POINTLESS, i shall leave you with that question. to stay up late or not to stay up late. yup.
