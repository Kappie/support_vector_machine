I'd hoped I would be posting those 'joys' before the 'angst', but, hey, that's the way it happens sometimes.   *sighs* So. There's this guy. If for whatever reason you happen to end up following this blog, you'll hear of him a lot. His name is Taylor. He's the longest "internet friend" I've ever known, having started talking to him about four years ago now. I love him. He loves me. I still don't know if we're boyfriend and girlfriend (side-note that I really dislike those terms, and at some point am going to come up with new words for those particular roles in a relationship), as he's been seeing another girl that actually goes to school with him (though things aren't looking particularly good for them last I heard), and we've yet to come to a long-distance relationship agreement. It's not as if it's an insufferably long-distance relationship, as it's only about four hours by train between the two of us, and in a year I plan to be going to college closer to where he is.   Now, about two months ago, he got me to join  urlLink Gaia . Last night, he posted in a thread that was a competition for the hottest guy, and yes, he is quite good looking and nummy. Initially I found out about it because he was "complaining" that he might be gaining stalkers. And, sure enough, I go onto this board and find them drooling over him left and right. This made me twitch a bit, but I was willing to let him have his fun because I know he doesn't have particularly high self-esteem and a bit of praise would do him some good. But then they started saying they want to find him and rape him (after he posted a picture of himself without a shirt holding a sign reading, "All hail Gaian woman!   So, yeah. I had to draw the line. I made a comment about wanting roasted fangirl on a bastard sword, lightly seasoned with honey garlic sauce. So one of the girls says, "Why do you hate -his username here- fangirls?!" I didn't respond right away, and another girl encouraged me to yes, eat them all. Anyway. A few replies later, he's telling me and the other girl to calm down, and eventually the girl decided that she didn't want to be part of a fanclub that people hated.   I talked to him about it later. He apologized, said he felt like a jerk... I told him not to, as I understood where he was coming from... I figured that was that. This was last night... Don't know if I mentioned that or not.   So, yeah. *sighs* He's back posting in this thread again tonight. I'm trying to talk to him about it again now. I seriously wish I wasn't so jealous, particularly as I don't know if I have the "right" to be, as I'm not his 'official' girlfriend... But when I see these girls saying they love him the most, and all that sort of crap, it really just lights that green fire of jealousy in me. Combine that with my general temper, and yeah, scary. I'm surprised my control has been so good thus far.
