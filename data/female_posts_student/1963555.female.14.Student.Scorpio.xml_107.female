So aparently she was talking to Adam (her ex from earlier thsi year) and Matt (actually he is her ex too!) and she said somthing to them, I'm not sure what it was but they were all giggly and doing the whole I-know-somthing-you-don't-know. But all I can make sense of it is that we were talking about a guy in school that they both think is gay,and then they looked at me mumbled somthing and laughed.... mabey Dacia told them I was a lesbien? Well I'm not so I don't know why she would say that... Another thing that might be is that, Adam was sitting on my desk, rubbing up as a joke and asking if I find him attractive. Earlier this year Dacia told Adam that I liked him, and I do but not like that, so mabey he thinks I still like him or somthing?...well I don't know, normally I'm really good with this kinda mind games but I'm so lost. I just hope they don'tthink that I"m a lesbien, that would kinda suck and not make it any easier getting a boyfriend. And if for some reason Dacia told them I was I'm gonna stop being friends with her. She's a bitch anyway So sorry to bore you I just needed all this info to refer back to..... see ya later! oh and Happy Easter! (late)
