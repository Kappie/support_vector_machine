Beg to be seen    Beg for pity    Beg for me.    Pale flesh and blue eyes    Stained and    Streaked and    Scarred    By your inadequacy.    ~    Feel the sun, the    warmth, the    life, and    Feel it leave     You.    Single tear,     releases    pain turns to    flood    Staining     You're beautiful    and raining on    the pavement.    ~    want and    need and    Beg for release.    Please end it.    You can't and    won't and could never.    Can't    Stand can't    move.    Bleed out as    the warmth clouds    over You.    Rain falls as    Your tears as    You're pale as    ~    you Fall.    Can't stand.    ~    Can't move.    ~    Dying.    ~    I'll save you.    You can have    my life and    my blood and    my soul     andYou'll.~    ~    ~    Live.    ~fin~
