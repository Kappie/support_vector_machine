Today I had a maths exam, but that's not very interesting or happy or even funny. I don't really feel like talking about it. I don't feel like studying or anything, I don't even care about bloody exams. I'm in such a great mood. -grins- Yesterday was hilarious at BATS (I seem to spend all my time there) so I'll rave about that. The looks Adam and I were getting from people whilst we held hands or whatever were classic. One especially funny case was when Tina, the music director, walked past us and did a double take. She gave us a knowing look and said "is there something I should know about." We looked at each other and shrugged, then turned to Tina who promptly screamed with delight and ran into the supper room. When I went in there later on to fix my lipstick (ugh, I hate lipstick) she dragged her husband in and pointed at me saying "That's Harry, you know Harry." A few teachers at my school are also involved in BATS and I've had a few interesting comments today as well. One Maths teacher, Mr. Paul Sczuzr (pronounced stewer) saw me today and said to his friend, and my Maths teacher, Mr. Tom Kerr "Harry's got a new boyfriend." Mr Kerr said in a very honest and heartfelt tone "That's great Harry." before adding "Even though people said you couldn't get I boyfriend I always knew you could." Typical. Hehehe, wait 'til I get my revenge! Mrs Eleanor Richards came and talked to my friend Jessica 'Jimmy' Keep about her Geography exam and she kept looking at me as though indecisive about whether or not to say something. When I asked her whether she had been at BATS yesterday, she took the opportunity to start raving about Adam to Jimmy and how nice he is and how cute the whole thing was. It's strange; at the second most stressful time of the year, I am still managing to have an absolute blast with my friends, BATS and my guy.
