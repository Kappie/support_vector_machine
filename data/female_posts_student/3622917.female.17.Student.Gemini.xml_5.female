Dru went out to a friends birthday last nite and mum drive out there to get him. In the middle of nowhere. Like twenty five minutes each way by car. She gets there and oops, he forgot to mention that he was staying over and he did try to call you know. Yeah so that was that. I hadn't really done much yesterday other than the Grand Cat Hunt of 2004. So I was all geared up with no place to go. Kirsti pulled through though and out to the movies we went. Saw the Terminal. It was all right. Funny and cute and pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks picture. Nothing really surprising. But it was still fun just to be out of the house. Cause I haven't been in so long! And I stayed awake! Sweet deal!  I am thinking of going up to the coffee shop for lunch. Mmmm bagel and cream cheese. (lol, Kandis) Er, yeah I really do love bagels though. When my dad gets back from rehab I will try and figure out how to put pictures up in here. He has the one of me where I have a bagel with cream cheese for a smile. And what is there not to smile about when you have a bagel? All right I think that I have taken that far enough. I'm like two lines away from agreeing to marry a bagel, and lets face it, that it not a good idea cause it would go mouldy after awhile. Have started to think about university and money. (way to go dave!) And there is going to be none. Money that is there had better be university or I am going to be really sad and work forever in a grocery store, which is fine. I really like my job and it is a good place to work. I was just hoping to get a different job, like a journalist or a photographer or something I dunno. We shall just see. That cardboard box just keeps sounding better and better! With windows and everything Al! Oh well, I am getting hungry cause it is almost twelve and with all the conversations I have going it has taken me a really long time to type this out. So I need food. I hereby declare today, Take Yourself Out For Lunch Day. Or if you don't read this before lunch, Dinner. Whatever flips your burger. (flashback to grade eight which is a really long time ago. I mean my brother is done grade eight and *shudder* he will be at my school next year. Lovely) Well, toodles I am off.  PS. Failure by Design by Brand New is a really not that good song. Brand New, I expected more from you. Pop Punk, I ask you???
