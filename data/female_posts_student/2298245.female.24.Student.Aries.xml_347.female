A female Navy pilot pleads guilty to manslaughter after having her less than stellar record as a pilot finally exposed after being hidden by her and the Navy in order to promote her as an emblem of gender equality and success in the armed forces.  McCoy and Ross walk down the steps of the courthouse after answering questions from the press:  Ross:  It's like finding out Amelia Earhart flew to Bakersfield and hid out for 50 years. McCoy:  I got over Pete Rose.
