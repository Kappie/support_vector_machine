The good news is that i am feeling better now that i can concentrate. I hate myslef when i dont concentrate. Tommorow is another big day I have like classes , meetings and is again a wrenching day. I love the wrenching part cause that keeps you on your toes. I do know sometimes you just want to run away but when you are away for along time you just want to be back to work, pressure and complications. I guess that a paradox isnt it life is one.   Anyways, I will go back to my reading , try to do constructive work. Honestly I do wish i was a bit more clever than i am now so that I could grasp things more faster and work smarter. I am not complaining as i do have a brain maybe its just an excuse. So i am thankful for whatever I have and I am lucky so take care and have a great day will write soon
