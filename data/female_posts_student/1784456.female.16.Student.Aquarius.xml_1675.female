I've just been out shopping for ball dress stuff *bluergh* I'm wearing my skirt that I wore as a bridesmaid to my cousins wedding *tried compacting that sentence, didn't work*, a cover thingy *?* that I got for christmas and a £10 top! Woohooo! The most expensive thing about the ensemble is the bag! Izzy also got a really nice dress! Yup, we danced to Spice Girls and sang along. Let's make that one of our New Year Resolutions to never do it again!
