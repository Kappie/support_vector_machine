Couldn't afford a digital one and for the purposes that we are using the camcorder for ( *silly grin* ), I figured that the Hi8 would be suitable..  Brian was really stoked!  I'll be posting pictures of us playing with it in the photo gallery soon..  In the meantime, if you're interested in buying one on the cheap --  urlLink visit Best Buy .
