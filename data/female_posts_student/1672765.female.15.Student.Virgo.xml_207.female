I got a Veggie burger and it took so long to cook (not many requests for veggie burgers) the lady gave us each free apple pies. That was so sweet. So go eat at Burger King because they are nice people!  Then I got home and didn't do anything then I trimmed my hair and now I have nothing to do. Except sit around and bemoan inwardly to myself about why I'm such a loser, failure, curse upon humanity. Is bemoan a word? I think I've seen/heard it before. My hair feels a lot lighter. I want to cut a lot of it but I don't know. I've always wanted to cut it very short and use gel on it because I think it'd be easier to manage. But what if it turns out badly or it doesn't look right on me? Stick with what you know. Change is bad.   I can't really think of anything else to say.   Oh right!! Take my quiz on quizilla! :  urlLink What song are you?   I would appreciate it greatly if somebody did!!! It has good results, including songs by The Smiths, I Hate Myself and Joy Division. 9 results in all! Ha. Nobody's taken it...I'm such a loser.    I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.
