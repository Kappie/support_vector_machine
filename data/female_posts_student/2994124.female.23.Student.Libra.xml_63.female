I was drinking out of my water bottle with one of those pullcaps on the top, you know which you pull up to drink (not sure what the technical word is and is incredibly hard to explain actually!)  Anyway, I finished drinking and was pushing it back down with my tongue as I always do, and my tongue got STUCK!  So here am I with my tongue stuck in the top of the drinking bottle and I couldn't get it out because it was in my mouth.  So I hop about and run into the kitchen making garbled noises to my flatmates, who just fall about laughing.  Eventually manage to pull it off, causing my tongue to bleed profusly.  So I spent the next 30 minutes sucking on an ice cube trying to stop the bleeding.  My tongue feels very funny now, but at least I managed to brighten up my flatmates day!  Spent a lovely afternoon in the coffee shop - it is hot here today so I had a chocolate frappucino rather than a hot choc - yummy!  Off to church now. Armed with paper and crayons.....
