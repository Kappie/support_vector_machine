You know what's also awesome? I'm going to California on Saturday! I want to be in the sun right now. Today it was sunny and soo blue and even though it was cold I just couldn't be expected to pay attention during math class, when she sat me by the window and everything. It'll be so fun, we're staying in the Disneyland hotel and... uh going to Disneyland! Wooo! I love Disneyland. How many times can I say Disneyland in one paragraph? And American Idol is on now. What is there not to be happy about?
