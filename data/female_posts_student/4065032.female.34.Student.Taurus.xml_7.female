There appears to be a mixture of tall grass, wild flowers, various weeds, and sporadically planted young trees. In the evening, however, this field area takes on a different personality. Distance croaky sounds drift toward all those close by. Sometimes these sounds belong to ducks; I have seen V shaped flocks traveling above. Sometimes these sounds belong to Great Blue Herons; I have seen these in flight as well. And sometimes, these sounds are the mating calls of frogs. (I have yet to see the frogs fly by.)  It, at first, seemed impossible to see water fowl in the air. After all, the bike path is land locked, or so I thought. I have noticed that toward the middle of the fields are hints of cat tails, the plant, not the animal. The brown cylinder shaped tops poke above grass. The long, narrow, green leaves sway with the wind. The actual water is out of sight, but clues to its existence are evident. I've been tempted to walk through the field to find the hidden niche, but I fear that swampy land will suck me in and keep me prisoner. So, for now, when walking by, I stop and listen to the birds. I watch the cat tails in the wind, and I wait for more information about this secret place to come to me.  You see, sometimes, I know, it is better to wait for answers than to go in search of them.
