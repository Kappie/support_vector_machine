Went to the doctor...nothin' wrong...just stress/anxiety as far as my doctor can tell...we'll find out after my blood test comes back...  yeah...about that...i had a flu shot AND had a blood sample drawn in the same arm...i can't even type well...  The guy that took my blood...haha...he said: "I have 2 rules...ready? OK...first...don't throw up on me...second...don't pass out on me...if you decide to do either one...i'd rather you throw up on me than pass out...don't handle that well..."  anyways he forgot to tell me to unclench my fist...haha..so i was very tensed up...  and my left arm freakin' hurts.  the end.
