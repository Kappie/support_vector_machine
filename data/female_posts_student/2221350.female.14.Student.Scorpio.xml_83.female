I should think it would be quite fanciful to set out on my own, my wonderful trekkie bag at my hip, birkenstock sandals scuffing the ground, a very large sunhat keeping the freckles away, and my hair flying around trying to escape the confines of a small piece of twine holding it at the nape of my neck. I would roam the Italian countryside, a worn copy of "Shakespeare", "Utopia", and "Robert Frost" in one hand, and a sac of fresh proshcutto, crusty bread, and young wine in the other. In my trekkie bag I would carry a change of clothes, a journal, an umbrella, a camera, "The English to Italian Dictionary", "The English to French Dictionary", and lots of money. And also I would have a 5x7 of my cat and my big red sunglasses and my purse since I can't really do much without my purse and a cell phone in case I get lost and need to send in for a helicopter.  today, as most days are, was boring. I trudged through the muck to all my classes and the only fun thing was walking to the park with Sarah and Bess during gym class and playing on the spinny thingy and jumping off the swings. I walked through so much mud getting to and from the park I threw my socks away when I got back to school... I, being an idiot, wore open shoes, so every step was a little mudbath for my feet... ewww  since today was such an awful bore((aside from losing a pair of socks)) I daydreamed through all my classes. I thought about how I wish I had more friends that I could be myself around. As of yet, there are about....2. Now hold the phone, I do have more friends than that, I just don't feel as comfortable around them. Mainly because I'm worried about upsetting them and then them not being my friend anymore. yahta yahta this is not very interesting...  we watched Chocolat in French, it was gooood. Especially since Johnny dep was in it and it was food themed. ((hehe))  um um I don't have anything else to say I don't think.
