Maybe its best that we don't talk, might help me, but it doesn't help my mind when i think of them, having fun, her, she to me is the most pathetic, feeble person i have ever seen, i mean thats selfish considering she is ill practically all the time but grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, i just need to tell her what shes with, a cheater, and she is one too. She thinks so highly of herself it makes me wana spew everywhere, cheap tart with her whorish ways indeed. I want him for me, but hes never ever ever going to look at me again, i'm not good enough for him.   ~Lisa~
