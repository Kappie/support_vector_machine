I know this probably seems dumb but little things like that mean alot to me...therefore I was sad...very. Yeah. Anyways I found the UCC Iowa link last night and saw that im in a picture on it...Madrid YC Meeting...That sure brings back memories...GOOD ones....I also found Ross's churches website and that gave me a laugh too...Anyways...today was okay. Mom woke me up kinda early and told me my Grandma Hansen was taking me birthday shopping today. So 'round 11 she came and we went over to Spencer. I got some really cute jeans with this really fun belt and two white tank tops...and a grey and white t-shirt. Then came home and went back over to Spencer about 5 with Kim. We had our girls night out again. It was fun. I got new sunglasses so I can take those to Tennessee with me. I started packing today and getting everything into piles. Fun stuff...Im getting more excited by the minute. Anyways Kim and I went to Anchorman and it was pretty good. Quite a few good laughs...Glad we didnt go to the Notebook...I didnt wanna cry. Ive done to much of that lately and I really dont know why...*shrug* Anyways Im looking forward to Monday more and more....Eh. Anyways...Thats all thats been going on....not to much...I was supposed to babysit tomorrow...but my uncle kinda doesnt have a job anymore...so I won't -get- to. Damn I needed that cash. I spent to much today...err...Oh well. Later all....   Tara    Current Music:  You're Still The One by Shania Twain  Current Mood:  Meh...  Quote of the Day:  "He said hiney" -Anchorman
