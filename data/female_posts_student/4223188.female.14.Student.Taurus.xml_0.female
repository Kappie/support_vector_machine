Yarp I'm back here again to complete my story... hehe sorry for the interruption the last time, but my dad wanted me to run some errands.... er like cleaning out the fish pond ( that involves going down into the disgusting algae-filled water barefoot, the happy koi fish slithering around your leg) and disinfecting our birdcage.... because one of my favourite parrots have some bacteria disease called "Newcasle"..... need to disinfect everything!!!! Haiz.... so sian Oh, in my last post I mentioned about something that my peers couldn't ... may have confused you a little so I thought I would make it clear... well a lot of people couldn't finish due to time constraints.... and were all like "Huhhhh.... I never feenish ley.... how arh? Die liao, why must be so deefeecolt one?" If you dont understand singlish slang, then skip the earlier sentence ok? Yup, and some of the more (ahem) refined people were like in deep discussion over the thought-provoking question of," Is affluence the number-one enemy of the environment?" so everyone were discussing until we sat for the next paper.... i will spare you the details about D bcos it will surely bore you to death.... (GURANTEED)   I cant tell you how happy I felt after the exams! Sleep was definitely on my mind.... not to mention the wonderful thought of slacking in front of the computer and playing to your heart's content.... wowee wowee wow.... slurp....   hahaz.... oright i have to go gain.... updating soon! NiteZ...
