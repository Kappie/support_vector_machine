I'm talking to Benedict"a" Ong on the msn.. it's so silent it seems that very little people are online..Benedict"a" Ong is confused with his choices again urlLink   .. First he said he wanted to go to Catholic Junior College .. haha if if he were to go there.. he'll see Su Lin..Lei Hong.. that groupa band seniors..then he said it was too far .. He was posted to Outram Institute.. I think.. or was it Jurong.. I can't remember.. sorry if I made a mistake..he wasn't very happy with his posting...So he appealled.. Alright when he appealled he was re-posted to Serangoon Junior College.. in which he said HE LOVED IT  was determined to stay.. Alright if he was staying.. he would see my ex band seniors... Jasmine Tan.. Ya Ling ... plus the npcc ma'am.. Alvina and another ex sec 4 Endurance girl? All currently in J2? Ok whatsoever back to the topic..Now he's like saying he's confused whether to stay on.. Poly.. better JC or stay on... blahz... I asked him whether he liked hands on work or academic.. he said both also can.. alright.. I had nothing to say.. then I told him about how a diploma is better as if a person fails his/her a levels.. it would be goners! Haha.... I was speechless when he said.. JC have my favourite subject. I said what? He said FM... I didn't know what it was at first.. he said Further Maths  I was like.. eee.. ok.. hahahaha... I loathed maths so much! Alright I forgot that Benedict"a" is a maths cum yoyo freak yea? LOL....Orry seems to hate Anglo-Chinese Junior College so much that she has stayed with that permanent nick that says "   acjc sucks - orries   " .. And I've seen a few ex sjc-ians .. some are doing fine in Jurong Institute while some of them are complaining that the lecturer sucks.. Emily's doin' fine in Millenia Institute.. glad to hear that...  Ok it's like 1 plus  I'm still not out of the house yet? What's up today? Not going to anybody's house? Another boring day? CRAP! Haiz....
