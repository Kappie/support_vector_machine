You think it's funny?  What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  You take your turn lashing out at me  I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me   All of my hate cannot be found  I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  So you can try to tear me down  Beat me to the ground  I will see you screaming"   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
