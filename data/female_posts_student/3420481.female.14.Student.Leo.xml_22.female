I started laughing to myself after I heard it so hear it is.  "What is this? A bra? Why do you need a bra?" - Some dude in Wally World "For my boobs." - Wife or Girlfriend of the Dude  Here's another quote I just heard on Colonial House like 20 minutes ago.   "Carolyn? That was the most beautiful walk to get the newspaper I've ever had." - Don Heinz
