When I first received this assignment and read the question, I knew right away that I would be writing about my opinion on gender specific classes in schools.   I considered the complete question; will this socialize boys and girls to be more like the stereotypes we have of boys and girls? Will emphasizing differences socialize children to be better citizens?  Or, does it mean a return to emphasizing differences that have caused women to be a minority group and thus discriminated against?  Spending a great deal of time considering the question, looking at it completely from outside of my opinion, I can honestly say that I cannot reasonably see any positive aspect of such a transition.  It has always been my opinion that when one gender is singled out above another, such as in gender specific classrooms, prejudice is bred.  For example, if a boy is raised only with other boys, he is, in my opinion, more likely to believe his gender superior by example.  I feel that this is perhaps the most damaging of all negative effects of such a division, to both genders.  To boys because they learn only to trust their own gender, and to girls because they are discounted far too quickly.    Consider a world where men and women never commingled until adulthood, being completely unaware of how to interact with the opposite gender would be disastrous for a society where both men and woman play crucial roles.  Segregation breeds segregation, and in order for the next generation to exist at all, women and men must commingle.  A crucial part of co-ed classrooms is the ability for children to have peers from which to grow and form gender identity.  I believe that interacting with boys helps girls to understand themselves better, and vice versa.   It has ever been a fight for equality between men and women.  In my opinion if we are to ever reach the next step, the step where men and woman are totally equal, equality must be taught to the coming generations, to children.  If classrooms were segregated, boys in one room and girls in the other are we adults not teaching them that one gender sits above the other?  When I consider this topic, an old cliché comes to mind, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”  By this I mean that adults are less apt to change their stripes and a life long belief in the superiority of one gender above another.    So, if I were to answer the question “will this socialize boys and girls to be more like the stereotypes we have of boys and girls?” I would have to say, absolutely!  What would we teach girls that we did not teach to boys, and vice versa?  Because the only reason I could see to segregate by gender would be to teach one gender something that is specific to their stereotype.  Would we teach girls to cook and rear children?  Would be teach boys mathematics and good economics?  Perhaps we did in the 1800, however as an enlightened society, as people who claim to be modernized; this caveman tactic would never work.    Moving on to; “Will emphasizing differences socialize children to be better citizens in a democratic society?” I would say, absolutely not!  In a truly democratic society, men and women should be chosen by their ability, education, and experience, none of which have anything to do with gender. The word “Democratic” can be defined as “Believing in or practicing social equality.”  In my opinion, the idea of social equality means equality for all, weather male or female.    Finally, the question; “Does it mean a return to emphasizing differences which have caused women to be a minority group and thus discriminated against?”  Absolutely, with out a single shred of doubt, yes!  Now, in America, women are already receiving less income for the same job.  It is a constant struggle for women to receive equal treatment due to years of “male dominated society” which I feel has got to come to an end.  Children are the leaders of tomorrow, to teach them gender equality is an invaluable asset to the future.    So in the end, I believe that segregating children by gender will breed prejudice and inequality. It will make gender identity every more difficult. It will grow a tomorrow of close-minded individuals and demoralizes the very meaning of democratic society.    ~Kristyn Hammond
