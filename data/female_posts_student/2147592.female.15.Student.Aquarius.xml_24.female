There was no cheery happy smiley Sammy face to make me smile, I've gotta stop with the whole Sammy thing don't I? It's getting quite embarrassing now! Well I had a little chat with Matt. He's so cool! He was in his Scout's uniform, I can tell he's cool because he went shopping one time with my mum! When I came home I kept singing and then thought to myslef, I need to make myself a depressing cd! So I browsed through my sisters cds and got loadsa cool ones. So most of today has been spent on this computer! I finally copied it, went downstairs, listened to the top ten, fatman scoop has a fat head! I love Outkast's new song, Hey Ya! It's soooo cool! At the mo I'm listening to the drugs don't work by the verve, I love it! Then me and Mum remembered there was this bonfire thing going on so we left to go to that. We had missed the fireworks! But I came prepared, I brought sparklers! Well came hoem and went on this thing. Right I'll be going now. I love Elton John!!! Bye guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
