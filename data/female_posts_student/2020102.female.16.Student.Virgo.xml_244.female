Austin: It's so funny and corny and cheesy. Sarah: No it's not! Austin: You probably only like it because Kevin Costner gets naked in it.  "Wow, I think that would seriously impair your ability to do stuff." -Austin when Robin Hood shot Will Scarlett in the hand with a bow and arrow  (when Robin says "what do we need that the forest cannot provide?") Austin: Oh yes, how would they be building houses? Sarah: They could cut down the trees. Austin: Right, kill the trees. Sarah: Yes, this was the start of deforestation.  (at some point during the movie) Austin: Look, it's a latrine. Sara: Do you even know what a latrine is? Austin: Yes, I'm in boy scouts.
