Many major chains — including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Best Buy Co. and Electronics Boutique of America Inc. — will have a carding policy in effect by the end of 2004, though the titles are available over the Internet."   This what the article (written by NICK WADHAMS) says about the subject of video game violence and what is being done to prevent young children from playing these games. Let me just say that if a 9 year old child has not seen someone get raped, murdered, fucked, shot, stabed, strangled, pistol whipped, gang banged, or paddled. Then that child parents have not been doing their job. I had seen all of that on television or heard it from music since I was 9 and I turned out only mildly retarded. The kids that do commit crimes and blame it on video games, are not victims, they are stupid and should be ass raped in prison. Otherwise I would like to see a little more of this (picture below) in video games rather then a character shiting flowers and hugging rabbits.
