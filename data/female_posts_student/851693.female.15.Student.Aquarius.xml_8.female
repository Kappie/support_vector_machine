I've just finished printing the tickets using my home printer and I'm proud (and relieved) to announce that there's only been 1 paper jam out of 49 printouts which is an achievement, considering that last year, when I printed the Romeo and Juliet tickets, I spoilt 20 sheets of precious metallic paper. So, I take this as a good sign that all will be well with our production! Now on to some target-setting for this week:  (1) PROPS- must get them ready in 2 weeks' time (ie, made and delivered to school!)      (2) COSTUMES- do we need to make them? Please confirm costumes by end of this week!    (3) PUBLICITY IN SCHOOL- we will publicise in front of the school during flag-raising on Tuesday, 17 Aug. Please get ready a 3 to 5 minute short excerpt and someone to introduce the what, when and where of the production. I need to see the publicity stint on Monday.     (4) TICKETS- all tickets have been printed. Please read these instructions..    WHAT WE HAVE: - 1 set of 490 tickets for 10 September - 1 set of 490 tickets for 11 September - 2 rubber stamps for serial numbering tickets - 2 black ink pads  WHAT WE MUST DO: - Cut up tickets professionally (use good pair of scissors or penknife and ruler) - Rubber stamp the tickets professionally (straight stamping and corresponding to the direction of printed side) 10 Sept tickets: Number 001 to 490 11 Sept tickets: Number 491 to 980  - Devise a way of keeping count of the tickets (eg: paper-clip sets of 20 tickets)  - Have 2 plastic containers to store tickets properly, 1 for each night.  - Put aside 20 tickets for each night as complimentary tickets. Someone with beautiful handwriting (like Chia Ming?) to write COMPLIMENTARY behind the tickets with a non-smudgy black pen.  - Note that the tickets printed are of exact number. Please keep tab of spoilt tickets to be reprinted for each evening.  - When we release tickets for sale, please ensure that there is a record book of whoâ€™s holding on to which tickets (identified by their serial numbers). For example, Nicole- 001 to 050. Please devise a record sheet and show me first before using it.       (5) PROGRAMME BOOKLET- to be finalised by end of week? I need to check through it in 2 weeks' time before sending for printing.      (6) PUBLICITY LETTERS TO SCHOOLS- to be sent out by early next week. We will tentatively use 30 August to go sell tickets in other schools.      That's all for now. We're entering STRESS ZONE because it's a month away, but please be tolerant with one another and help one another in whatever way you can. This is going to be one of the few fond things you remember of your secondary school life, so strive to enjoy yourself and be understanding towards others. :)   Love, Ms Ng
