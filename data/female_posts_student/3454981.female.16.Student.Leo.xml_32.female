But I guess if I had to, I wouldn't mind being labeled as emotional cuz that's anatural thing, to be emotional--right?hehe :)    I'm kind of into finding the good little bands out there that no one knows about and then when everyone finds out about them, I've already gota signed T-shirt or their EP which has been recently discontinued. *smiles* it makes you feel special, or smart. But anyway...I love how this site has    typical    emo people "figured out" like down to the pins worn on pants or even the dirty little secrets. It's funny, because I don' think any person can be typical. They can try to be, but generally never succeed.     Well, this is my    lighter side    observation of the day compared to my last post.           Oh, and before I forget...the song of the day is     "Letters To You" by: Finch       + one of my old favorites :)
