A little while ago there was a rumor that he was scheduling a free concert to coincide/conflict with the Re-pube-lick-an convention this summer.  Next thing I know, I found  urlLink draftbruce.com , an appeal to the Boss to hold his concert at Giants Stadium on September 1.  Apparently, this Andrew Rasiej -- who "used to be a concert promoter who started Irving Plaza in New York City" and who has "relationships with many music industry professionals" -- reserved Giants stadium for September 1st.  Is that like getting a reservation at Balthazar for September 1st?  Weird.    Admittedly, a quick check to the  urlLink Giants stadium website  reveals that it does indeed seem to be "free" on September 1st.  I think the whole thing is interesting, and weird.   I do know that I fuckin' love Bruce though.
