He unzipped all the windows and took off the doors , it was pretty cool. I think riding there and back was one of the best parts (as funny as that sounds)your hair is going everywhere, it's cold as hell from the wind, it's also loud as hell..all you can hear is the music blasting along with the wind wiping by...but I loved it all. We got to the beach around 2 and the weather was pretty good, sunny but not to hot. We just hung out..most people would probally think that the day we had was boring and pointless, but today was the definition of what I want my summer to be. Just spending the day with my best friend...having fun doing absolutely nothing. We had some crazy in depth conversations too haha who'd ever know that Madi and me could actually have an in depth conversation, without being extremley retarded.  Awww...I swear Tim and Emily are the cutest thing ever. If they aren't perfect I don't know who is. They have the relationship that everybody wants, they are each others best friend, it's the coolest thing ever. Just watching them wrestle on the beach and goof off, and then be all lovey dovey later..it just shows how strong of a relationship they really have. Even just the simple things , like the way that they smile at each other..That's what I want, someone i can just be myself around no matter what and not worry about what they think. I think the thing I want most is just someone to care about me...and that's one of the hardest things to find.  Madi made a point on her Blog the other day about the way guys act. Yeah her point...." you think someone likes you but you can never really tell..I just hate it when you really like somebody but they're all like afraid to open up ..or they say they like you , but you never really know where you stand with that person?"..this is coming directly from Madeline's blog...ohh yeah you should check hers out too...   urlLink    ..(there!!) But anyway back to the point..she is exactly right! I'm all about putting it out on the table. I hate not knowing, or wondering about what's going on. And that opens this subject up..I hate it when people don't give a fuck about anyone elses feelings. I just don't understand how there can be no type of compassion for other peoples feeling..  Nick thinks I write weird, along with some random person that posted the comment.."yes you do" referring to me writing weird. Just because I'm not all deep..and I don't have perfect "structure" in my writing dosen't make it bad, at least not in my eyes. OHH GREAT..I just got an e-mail telling me I got another comment on my Blog about how weird I write..WELL FOR ALL YOU Anonymous commenters...I DON'T CARE! I'm not "working" on my writing because I don't want to , I like it just how it is ..so if you hate it...DON'T READ IT. ugh...man! Well I'm tired of writing for now..so I'll just post this so everyone can SAY HOW MUCH THEY HATE IT haha!  **no one will understand the title except Madi..so don't even try..
