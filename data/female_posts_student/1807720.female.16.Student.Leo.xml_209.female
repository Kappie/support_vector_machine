Bio makes no sense.  It's great for all of those I-understand-every-damn-thing-always-kind-of-people, but it just sucks that I am not one of them.  Last time I studied my life away and my mark sucked, and this unit makes no sense.  I don't know what to do to understand.  I actually felt really stupid asking her "how do I do this?" and "How do I do that."  Bio is suppose to be my thing.  It's something I like, but sometimes hard work doesn't get me to where I want to be.  I suppose what ever will happen is going to happen.  No matter what I have basically passed it course it's just University standards are becoming way higher and it's harder to get it and that scares me sometimes.  I think all will be ok, and things will work out, but sometimes I just really have to question things like that.  I need to question choices, options, etc... but I am absolutely certain that I want to be a Bio teacher and I am going to do anything that will get me there.  I feel like such a bitch today.  Maybe it's cause I feel lazy or ate too much junk for breakfast.  Maybe that's it, but I really don't know.  I'm glad flames won yesterday, but really I would rather have like a thousand other things then just a win.  Maybe I am so stressed out cause finals are coming, school is almost over, and it seems like I have no time.  I am so busy this weekend!!!!  After school today Ali, Carli, Meg and I are working on our drama project for a couple of hours and then I might go over to Mat's house and help him and Ash on their Chem project.  Knowing how things usually work I will probably be the one doing the project instead of them.  Ya that is how it usually works - guess that is what you get for being totally nice.  But I like it, nice is the way to go.  I finished my English project of poems and that's why I am taking a break.  I haven't written anything down in my journal forever.  I just need to get things of.  Not to mention I have been eating like massive loads of junk food all the time.  It's strange though cause I can only eat large amounts of food when I am alone and no on is looking.  Whenever there are others around I eat really healthy and not very much.  They sometimes think I stave myself, but that's not that case.  If anything I eat too much.  I got drunk at the wedding, but it was all in good fun.  Me and this uncle Mike we like doing a disco solo to 'staying alive' which I kind of remember - it was crazy, wicked fun!  And like Ben's side of the family kept buying me alcohol - a lot of coke with rum's, I had white wine, red wine, punch, and water.  All day it was like RUSH, RUSH, RUSH!!  We had to put up signs, basically swallow our lunch whole cause there was no time to chew, and get our hair done, do our make-up, and yeah just way too much.  On the Friday before the Saturday I got my nails done, went out to Boston Pizza with the Mid Summer Night's Dream Cast.  We ordered like 3 appetizers, 2large piazza's, and like 5 desserts.  Then we went back to Alex's house, jumped on the tramp, ate and drank more, and played a million improve games like party quirks etc...  So fun, so fun!  The day after the wedding we went to Jim's place and ate more.  We had French toast, eggs, sausage, left over cage, brownies, chile, butter tarts, cinnamon buns, muffins- Yeah, ok, get the idea - We had WAY TO MUCH to eat!  tomorrow I am going shopping for a dress for the Cadet Awards Banquet, I need to also get some tanks and shorts that actually fit too!  All my old clothes are too big.  Early that morning I am helping my Mom with the garden and then in the evening there is a party at Ashley's house, dinner, food, and we are watched the game on her big screen T.V.  Yeah GO FLAMES GO!  And then Sunday I have to memorize my lines for our Drama final project and believe me there are a lot of lines.  Then I need to study my Bio - well actually figure it out.  Analyze it.  It's like a friggin foreign language.  So difficult.  So hard.  Everything in school and life in hard though so it's not like there is any difference fro before.  Monday night I am also going to bust my ass studying.  It's my last chance to raise my mark before the final.  That's it.  The end.  Last chance.  Scary thinking about it.  But I pray to God that I do good, because I deserve it, work hard for the marks I have and the marks I want.  I want to go places.  I want to be something in life, and I will.  I know I will.  I can do whatever I want to do because I know that I can.  I am capable of anything and the world knows that.
