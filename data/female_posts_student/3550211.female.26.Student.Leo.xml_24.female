It was freezing cold, there were no celebrity guests and Matt wasn't even there. We didn't stay very long.  I only bring this up because Vince Vaughn is currently being interviewed by Matt Lauer on the Today Show. PLUS, he was outside signing autographs for the dorks holding their signs hoping to get on TV.  So, I'm a little jealous. So what. I'll recover .. even though I love Vince Vaughn. Nothing beats "Swingers." "Old School" was awesome as well. And now, I have to admit, I am looking forward to seeing "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."   During Vaughn's interview they suggested that almost everybody remembers dodgeball from their elementary school days, and from those memories there are only two ways people feel about dodgeball: you love it or hate it. You were either the kid hiding in the corner because you got hit in the face, or you were the kid who threw the ball a 100 mph into some kids face.   I was the kid hiding in the corner because the boys always threw the ball super hard and it HURT!
