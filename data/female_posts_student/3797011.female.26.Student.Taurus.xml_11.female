But after all, it's so difficult to find it. We have passed 59 years of our independence. Manythings happen, rebellions, violances and terrorisms. The poor citizens become poorer and the rich become richer, so unfair. When the democracation is just a word, nothing implementation. The voices from the citizen is unlisten. When the cry is no tears, the words is unspeakable and the hurt is just keep inside.   Now the reformation is open, all start to be repair and rearrange. The general election become an implementation of democracation. But is it really a true democration? or same still....just the all bads is hide behind the name of democration?  Are we'll just keep silent see our country become more drowning and drowning everyday? Where is the spirit of the country's son? Really we miss our Indonesia, the green , friendly and the peace of Indonesia. When all will be materialize?   ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
