Anyway I was speeding off down my street to meet Erica for dinner at Armadillo before we had RUACH and the windows were down the sunroof was open and the music was blaring some song that was really upbeat and awesome and I randomly said, out loud, "Man, I love my life"! Without thinking about it, without meaning to, it kind of shocked me.  Last week I felt alone and overwhelmed and this week I don't.  I've been in a good mood and more open, and I guess people can tell.  Random people start talking to me when I'm in a good mood, strangers in line and cashiers too, while it's kind of scary and really weird its also pretty nice.  And just a note for my future self, my life is pretty cool.  While things aren't how I pictured them to be when I was little, and yes, I'm still single, there are other things to make me happy.  This warm weather and light homework helps, so does getting starbucks on my way into school and going to dinner with a friend later in the day.  So yeah, life is good.
