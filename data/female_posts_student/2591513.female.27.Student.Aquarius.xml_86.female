What is hurting my chances of getting decent jobs is that I don't have hands on expereince with children.  So this is something I am looking forward to.  Like I said, the pay isn't great, hell I think it is under the minimum wage, but it is all under the table and just a few days a week for a couple of hours.  I think it will work out in the long run.  The lady who interviewed me is very nice and the children she has in the program are really well mannered and fun.  I think it is a great opportunity for me to get a great deal of expereince with them.  She has also offered for me to try out some of the lesson plans I have.  So I think that will be cool too.  I just got back, my first real day of work is on Friday, and I am so very excited.  I sound funny...but hey, this will help with Ed's gas money to and from work...that is going to help out.  Things are so tight, it isn't even funny.  Well anyhow, I better get going...I hope you all have a wonderful week.
