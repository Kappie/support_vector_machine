       
      I feel cold. I feel so cold, like the unshed tears of a snake after it's struck. I feel so alone. So incredibly alone. After such a brief high, such a brief wonderful high, I sink so low. Lower than when I started. Lower than I've been in a while. You don't understand. You can't possibly understand. But know this. It's got to stop. It has got to stop.   I'm sorry.
