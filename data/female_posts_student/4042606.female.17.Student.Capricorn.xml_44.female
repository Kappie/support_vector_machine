I always worried about how he'd handle things, and I still do. For some reason though he is capabable of pulling himself out of a hole of depression with remarkable speed. I think  A Figure In October  is his funnel to get rid of some of that depression. That is why he is still around. I don't think he will actually be posting his thoughts for a while, posting the story everyday is kind of his little vacation, a vacation I think he deserves. I just hope he keeps busy, I know what happens when he sits around and begins to think. Sorry Ian, for sharing a piece of your mind with the world, but, people need to understand. While some fall apart, Ian just shovels it into the back of his mind. I am still sad from yesterday, but, I am learning from Ian, and I to will try and find an outlet for my sorrow. Sorry this post is so depressing, but, it is something I needed to get off my chest before I became even more depressed. I know Ian will probably not talk to me for a while. He has already started to break off communication with me.
