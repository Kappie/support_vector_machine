I dig this album but I have to admit my favorite Ben Harper album is Fight For Your Mind! That cd will probably always be my favorite, with my all time favorite Ben Harper song Opression! I think you can hear it on his website if you click the link. I love Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals. The biggest treat in seeing him was a couple years back (3 maybe?) when Ben opened for DMB at RFK and then returned to the stage during Watchtower (the encore.) It was probably the best version I had ever heard... as Dave Matthews is now highly aware of :) Go check them out though, they are definitely worth a listen.
