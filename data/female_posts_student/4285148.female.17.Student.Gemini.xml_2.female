My Dad woke me up at 10 to ask if I was planning on being alive at all today.  For a couple of hours I talked to Jenna about next years theatre class(with both Laura and Kelli together), her senior photos, and Mr. Hagar as an addition to LVA faculty.  From someone who recieved a D on her chemistry final, I can certainly say that I would have loved to take science with this teacher.    We were having fun until she began to sing "Letting Go" from J  H and I knew I had to hang up.  Not because her singing is bad (because she has an unsuspecting , elegant voice) but because I need a few months before the ring of Taylors voice fades from my memories.  Instead we looked at the online pictures from the Nebraska peformance  urlLink www.rbruhn.com . (The first picture has Jenna in it, and the last has Taylor dying).   so much for accomplishing a lot today.  I'll leave with a quote...  "Live to make the child you were proud of the person you are"
