Just as the sound turned the corner, Tittanya threw the tiny stud. The police man she had just hit in the jugular screamed, and she absorbed the wash of fear he released. "Your aim is impressive, but you made the mistake of giving me his death. Though an unintentional gift, I thank you."  Tittanya had spun at the first word, throwing arm poised. The sight that greeted her made her hesitate. Marion leant against the wall, holding her own heart with Tittanya's knife sheathed in it. Marion found the direction of Tittanya's gaze and commented, "An Interesting symbol, the pierced heart. A symbol of love, of a broken heart." At that, Tittanya threw remaining stud. Her trembling body betrayed her, making her miss the jugular. Marion removed the silver jewelery from her cheek and inspected it curiously. then she laughed. "Ah, Tittanya. Silver does not affect me, for I am not dead. If I were, why do you think I would need the death of those such as the policeman? I am protected from death by Death, and Death has power over everything.” “Exept Immortals.” “You are not Immortal, Tittanya.” As she once again harrnessed her terror, preparing to jump, Tittanya wondered how Marion and her own positions and personalities had become so confused. Didn’t she used to be the implacable one? She thought she heard a soft whisper as she landed on the roof, a whisper that sent a shiver down her spine.  “For my sister.” It was then that Tittanya realised she should have killed Marion first.
