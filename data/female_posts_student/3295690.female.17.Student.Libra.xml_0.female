So so much to say... so much... looks like another long entry coming up for you all to feast your eyes upon. :P   Believe it or not, the first week of my holidays has already past! *blinks* Yeh... so I guess i'll start with last Friday, fantastic night that it was! *grins* It happened to be Tom Howard's 18th Birthday party... dear God it seems like such a long time ago now... anyway, it was a dress-up party "Dress up as your favorite musician" and I could hardly dress up as Eddie Vedder. :P So a bunch of us girls, Lu, Pheebs, Starkie, Em and myself decided to go as the Spice Girls, and I got stuck with skanky Ginger! Everyone said that I should've been Baby, and y'know I actually agree for once, but no... Pheebs decided that she would be Baby and I would be Ginger, so that was that. Anyway, we promised Tom that we'd be early, but ended up being two hours late or something, and I turned up looking totally disgusting, so thank God for the free beer and champagne to accompnay my Bacardi, or that night would've sucked!  Anyway, the party was pretty good as it happened, I manged to get myself drunk enough to have a great night, despite the rumours being spread later, but i'll get to that in a paragraph further on.  I also had a big talk to my ex-boy John and managed to de-weirdify things which is always a good thing. :)  The night after that was Mel's 18th Birthday dinner at La Suprema which was also nice, despite the weirdness that sort of came out between Pheebs and myself. It was really just her snubbing me a lot, and being a bitch to me, and I assumed it was because I had seen her the night before doing what looked like kissing John, only I had asked her about it and she had flat-out denied it, and so I believe her, but I just assume that she thought that I didn't or something... I don't know, it was weird, and she flirted with John all night and seeing as she's one of my best friends, I was shitted with her. *nods*  Over the last week i've really just worked a lot, God, I have so much to say and really I just can't be bothered saying it at all. Blah. I think I might sign out here, and at a later date, explain things that might need explaining. *nods*   Lotsa Love, Simbles xoxo
