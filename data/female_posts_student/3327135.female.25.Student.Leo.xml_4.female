Had been writing my report for the whole night with only an hour of sleep before coming to *** and continue doing it. Finally finished the first draft of the report. Although tired, just don't feel like sleeping. Felt like rushing home the minute the clock turns 6 pm. :) What's the rush for? Go home and watch Untraceable Evidence II (Disc 5)!!! Hahahahahaa...   The reason why I had to stay up whole night to do the report was because I had spent the whole weekend watching Untraceable Evidence (Part I) and Flora's video clips!   Oh yes, I had taken down Sammi's poster which had previously adorned the wall in front of my desk! And guess what? I had replaced it with a photo of Flora. Flora looks really gorgeous in the photo but too bad, the photo is not as large as a poster and the wall looks kind of blank. And this means, I need to get a poster of Flora as soon as possible. Anyone who sees any shops selling Flora's poster in Singapore, please leave me a message at "Comments" or "Guessbook". I would really appreciate it. :) Thanks in advance!!
