Well I think I kinda know why....but I don't want to talk about it and I'm sure everyone knows anyways. So then after school, I went to Kim's softball game with Carol and Sarah. That was kinda fun making fun of the other team's coach. They lost 6-5 tho. Congrats to Kim for moving up to Varsity! I'm so proud of her. lol Then I came home and just watched tv and was depressed all night. I was in an even worse mood then.   I woke up this morning at 9:30 but told myself I was stupid and to go back to sleep. So I watched tv and was kinda half asleep. After I got bored of that I got online. And now I'm listening to Rooney and talking to Molly. Maybe I'll go to teen thing tonite...I dunno...  So whatever. This vacation is gonna suck. I hope someone has a good party so I can go and actually have fun for once...  Song:   I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal  To be normal And I've forgotten what food tastes like The way it tastes right The taste buds taste right Well I wake up in so much spit and sweat It is not normal  What is normal I go to bed When I wake up After cleaning all All the spit and sweat Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' I'm Sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now  I tossed and turned all night Cause I, cause I was looking for, for an ending This was so because, because I watched all day The "Neverending story" with Atreyu The next day came but not a beam of light Because the blinds were shut sh sh sh shut so tight I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat It made me very cold Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now   I'm supposed to feel better This nightmare supposed to end   I am holding on  I'm shakin' now  -"I'm Shakin'"-Rooney
