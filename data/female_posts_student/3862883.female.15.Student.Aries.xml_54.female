In a civilized environment it's easy to judge, the rules are set and everyone knows them, but in the jungle, in the darkness, the concepts of right and wrong change. Survival seems to be the only rule, even though surviving implicates the extermination of others. Kurtz is just surviving in the jungle. We cannot judge Kurtz, for our rules of the game do not apply to him. From our point of view, he might look as a ruthless murderer, atrocious and mad. But to those who follow him, who havelived what he has lived, and seen what he has seen, he is a genius, a king, a god. Judgment depends on the point of view.   Captain Millard judges him at first as insane, but as he himself enters into the darkness realizes that he cannot judge, only survive. Kurtz murder is presented to us as a sacrifice because it is parallel to the ritual of the cow, a necessary sacrifice, not punishment. In a world of darkness, where all is taken away from you, the rules of the civilized cannot apply to your behavior, survival is the only priority.
