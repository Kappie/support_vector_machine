In the word "ROLL" there's a whole bunch of singers/rock star pplz. It's amazing! There's Sir Elton John, Freddie Mercury, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, George Michael, Bono, Aretha Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, Axl Rose, Steven Tyler, among others lol. I'm thinkin one might be Madonna and Janis Joplin. I got some other pics n a movie poster or two. Some we spent like 50 cents on. The Roll collage is a good example of the 50 cent buys. Auctions rock my world. The only bad thing is I was out in the sun for another few hours. I'm an overly toasted wheat cracker...it's the shoulders. And now I have about 4 different tan lines and they overlap. It looks pretty funny for a while lol. So yea...I'm gonna take a nap. I think the heat got to me. Later all
