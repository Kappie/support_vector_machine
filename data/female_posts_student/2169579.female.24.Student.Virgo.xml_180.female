Success or romance feels like a foregone conclusion. The two can be combined for a powerful duo. Filled as you are with questions, you have nothing to hide in your pursuit of the answers. The pursuit will actually be the most fun. You are likely to end up with answers you had never considered due to the experiences that you encounter along the way. ~~ my personal horoscope for 7/27  *yeah fuckin right!!! the answers i wanna hear i won't!!! but it doesn't matter cuz i'm toasted on cheap ass wine!!! nothin like cheap ass wine to cheer up a rainy buffalo nite!!! cheers to getting the hell outta town!!!!  hell yeah baby!!!
