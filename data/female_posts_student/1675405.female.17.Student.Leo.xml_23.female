Alex says he'll try to warm Aaron up to the idea of taking me. I just wish people would mind their own business. If someone is going to ask, I'd rather they do it because they want to, and not just because they want everyone to stop harassing them. Why do others insist on meddling in my life? It's MINE!  I'm going to start volunteering for the junior high girls tennis team starting tomorrow. I really need volunteer hours, plus I think this is the perfect opportunity for me to share my knowledge in a positive way.  Okay okay, I need volunteer hours for National Honor Society, not to mention college. I need to start rolling down the path of post-high school prep! AHH!  School is really fun this year, so far at least. I'm a bit more social, at least during 6th period, and it's all for the better. Plus, my classes are fun, aside from Biology of course, and I'm not super stressed out  yet (I love my run on sentences ~ oh well, that's what a journal is for; it doesn't have to be gramatically correct) I can use; as many; of these; as; I want; to!
