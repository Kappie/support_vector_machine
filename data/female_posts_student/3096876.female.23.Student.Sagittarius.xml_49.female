In December 2003, as happens at the end of every year, I had a PAP test. Doctors and other health care workers educate us of the need for preventative health care -- catch it before it becomes a problem. Every year I have a PAP test. I sit up on that table while an overly hairy man dives in up to his elbows in my crotch. Checking stuff out. But this PAP was different. This time, a month later, I got a call. The PAP results were "abnormal" and they've booked me in with a specialist. Just like that.   This new doc, we'll call him Dr Dentures because I really am worried that some day I'll walk out of his office with a set of his poorly affixed teeth in my pussy, he told me not to worry, just to be diligent. We'd do a colposcopy (peek-a-boo in the down-there area with a fancy camera) and possible a LEEP procedure. After the colposcopy, he said that it wasn't just dysplasia; it was   urlLink high-grade dysplasia  .   I remember very clearly asking him:  "Just how long does it take to go from everything's a-ok to high-grade?"  "Well," he said, "How long was it since your last PAP?"  "A year," I said.  "Then it takes a year."   A month ago, I had surgery to remove a part of my cervix. A "part" my doctor called it. A cone was burnt out because it contained cells that he called dysplasic, but more accurately are pre-cancerous cells. He told me that this surgery would remove the cells and keep me from developing cancer. Just as long as there is no abnormal growth, there's nothing to go to cancer. Ok, fine. He just told me to report back in a month, and we'd talk about the results.   Yesterday, a month was up. Yesterday, I went to his office, a part of me fretting madly, and a part of me trying to reassure myself that truly, everything was ok. The results: Everything is not ok.   "We had a look at your cervix, and it seems that the dysplasia was a little further along than we had originally thought. It seems that it had taken over virtually all the surface of your cervix. We removed the minimum amount that we safely could."  "So does that mean that you didn't get it all?" Mom asked him.  "No, I think we got most of it. Yeah, we got it all." He said.    Dr Dentures, you do NOT reassure me.  He was ready to dismiss me as soon as he finished answering Mom's question.  Woah, woah, woah! This is my body, and I've got a couple damn questions too!    "I'm still confused, doc. How did this happen? How did I go from having a normal PAP last year, to severe dysplasia this year?"   The quack didn't really answer me.  "No one really knows why some women develop dysplasia and some don't."  Yeah, thanks a whole fucking lot.    This is what I believe: I believe that my GP just wanted to ching-ching OHIP, and the PAP was him just going through the motions. He knew I had an STD years ago, and even though it was treated, he didn't connect the dots to any possibility of future reprecussins. He didn't treat me in accordance with any sort of preventative medicine. Just an "all's well" blinded sort of approach. My thoughts are that this dysplasia has been there for years. 2003 was just the first time he noticed.   "What about long-term affects?"  Come on doc, let's look ahead a bit.   "Well, I don't think you have anything to worry about,"  Oh no???  "As long as we keep following this carefully, your chances of developing cancer are really slim. And if you have to have a couple of procedures, that's ok. It's if you have to have 3 or 4 or 5 than there may be some concern about the shrinking of your cervix and your ability to hold onto a pregnancy."  So that's what it means, "nothing to worry about"??? I only have cancer and miscarriage to consider, eh?    He's sending me now to see a gynecological oncologist at Princess Margaret. Perfect. I'm not worried at all. I also made an appointment to see my GP. In his chivalrous largesse, he told me months ago that if ever I had any questions, not to hesitate to come and see him.  Yeah, I got a question: why the fuck didn't you find this shit years ago when it started???    Mom says that he will never admit to not seeing the dysplasia. He will always assert that it only just showed up. All the same, I want him to know that I know what he's done. I want him to be afraid. And I'm going to ask the specialist at Princess Margaret what their opinion is on how long it takes for severe dysplasia to form, because they won't know my docs and they won't have any loyalty to them.   This needs to end now, because I can't spend the day madly typing away. I am going outside to enjoy this beautiful day, because there are things in life more beautiful than this, so I want them.
