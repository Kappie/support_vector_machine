Nothing big, just some of the girls from sunday school gettin' together, playing games and eating pizza. I need to keep in mind how many slices I have, you see, I'm tring to loose weight. Being 215 isn't fun. I guess it's better than 225; that's was what I was before the diet thing. I'm doing it in a healthy way, don't worry. It's based on porportions, and I can eat anything I want, but the more unhealthy it is, the less I can have of it. I lost the ten pounds in the first two weeks, but sorta just stayed at that point. Give or take a pound. I hate it when girls at school or even church complain that they gained a pound, or even two! Oh my goodness! It's the end of the world! Now they can't eat for two weeks! People, you can't even tell. Get over it, or at least, don't take your 90 pound self to  me  and complain. Anyway. Well, that was enough, I guess. Have fun! ~U.D.b.a.F.o.G.
