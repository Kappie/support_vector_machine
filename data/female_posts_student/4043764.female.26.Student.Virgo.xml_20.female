Had an uneventful and expensive night's rest north of there - God knows where (they seemed to think they were part of Baltimore, but the signs said otherwise...) And I am too tired to make sense of the whole trip quite yet. I drove and drove until I got stopped at a bajillion toll booths. George Carlin has a funny bit where he says: "Why don't you guys just tally everything up, I'll write a check when I get to the state line..." I certainly felt that way in New Jersey. Shit, I felt that way in New York, Delaware, Massachusetts... I must've shelled out at least $20.  Traffic was horrible in CT. Every highway sign - you know, the ones that warn you about traffic and delays and missing children - said something like, "Expect delays from exit 12-42, 30 miles". Um, that means there's traffic EVERYWHERE, doesn't it? It means there's a fucking delay throughout the whole fucking state of Connecticut, not so? Ugh. I will go to sleep soon, thinking about all the stuff I left in the car and the fact that the car is parked by a meter. Ugh.  Oh, and though I keep making solid commitments to self about boy and derivative relationships with him, I did let him know that I arrived safely and appreciated the window fan for my attic room. He says that he decided that the original going away gift that I wanted was too impersonal and that he will send me something more "special". I just hope it's not another gag gift CD ("I knew you'd never buy it for yourself...") or surprise article of clothing...  I guess I'll be grateful for anything - it's the thought that counts.. Maybe his mother will see his depression for what it is. Really worried about him.  I am scatterbrained. Will rest now.
