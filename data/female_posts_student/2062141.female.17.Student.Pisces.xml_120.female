Even though the vastness of space is sort of scary, seeing it from here on Earth has got to be the most beautiful thing in the world. In my neighborhood on a clear night you can see every star. I've seen three shooting stars... in the summer I lie out in my backyard with good old Flash and just look at the stars. Stupid winter, can't do that. I've been missing summer alot lately.
