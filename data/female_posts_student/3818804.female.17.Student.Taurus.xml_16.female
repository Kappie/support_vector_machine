In all my 7 years never....err   I was supposed to go to the beach today but something came up. lolz. And then I had the opportunity to go to Raging Waters too! :( But I couldn't do that....The curse always comes at the most inopportune time. I hate you.   So here I am chillaxin at my house becauseI dont feel well. crappy. under the weather. shitey. down in the dumps. lolz. etc.   P.S. My uterus hurts.....
