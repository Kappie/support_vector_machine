Tried to call my doctor today for an appointment (use the benefits while they last) and apparently there's a 6 month waiting list.  Thank God I'm not dying.  God bless managed care.  Anxiously anxiously looking to leave this god forsaken state. Please, Please PLEASE keep your eyes open for jobs for me.  I'm getting closer and closer to completely losing my mind.  That aside, here is the rough itinerary for my trip to Washington for those of you who have been asking:  you can see the conference schedule at www.youthcourt.net            Friday April 12th--we should be arriving at approx 2pm into Regan Airport.  I'm anticipating we'll check into the Crystal Gateway Marriott by around 4 or so.  (We being my intern and I.)  The rest of the day and night our OURS.  We intend on doing some good partying, so those of you that are around, please join us.  I love showing off the fabulous, beautiful, intellegent men in my life.  No, Matt, I'm not talking about you.  :)  Okay, I am talking about you, but you don't need the ego boost.            Saturday--Jack around in the hotel, plan for sightseeing, hang out around the colleges and try to look for apartments on a limited basis.  At some point late afternoon Jason and the kids should start arriving.          Sunday--begin an exhausting week of networking.  Check in to the conference in the morning, attend an intensive seminar, babysit for a bit, network some more, fun with lobbying at the expo, spend the evening freaking out about my presentation on Monday morning--this is not a good day to plan on hanging out with me, but feel free to stop by the hotel.  I'll be the girl pulling out her hair surrounded by middle schoolers and one frazzled intern.        Monday--my lecture is at 11:15 am.  I would love for you all to be there, but I understand you all have to do that whole college thing.  I don't think the conference sessions run past dinner time, so my evening is free.        Tuesday--same as Monday.  This is the last day of the conference, so some partying may be in order---hopefully I'll have some good job opportunities up my sleeve.        Wednesday--sightseeing with the kiddies and hopefully a job interview or two in the city if I can get away.  I will have to be dragged kicking and screaming back to the airport at some point during the airport.  Back to Florida at around 9pm.  So anyway, that's the plan as of now.  Of course, this is me we're talking about so it's probably going to be completely different by  this time tomorrow.  After talking to Andrew P. tonight, I am convinced that I am indeed getting old.  Jeez, we know so many people gettting married, having babies, it's so scary.  Meanwhile, I'm still struggling to do what I should have done a long time ago--get the hell out of this god forsaken state.  I just have to keep July 31st in my head.  It's the only thing keeping me going this week.
