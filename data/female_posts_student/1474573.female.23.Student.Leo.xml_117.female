I have 3 roomates, I've met one, she seems cool she's from raleigh N.C. She's souther so at least tries to act friendly. The other is a down south girl (black as opposed to the other one) She just moved back in from the january break about  4 hours ago. She doesn't seem so nice ,she's got a white boyfriend and seems insecure if there's another black woman in the presence. She can' t be the special token one anymore.....ok maybe i'm being judgemental.so??  film at 11
