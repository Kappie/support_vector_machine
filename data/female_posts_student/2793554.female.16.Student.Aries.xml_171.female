Not to mention im in a really bad mood so this is all amplified. fuck that sauce. i had an ok day i guess, i feel really sick right now, like im going to puke.  i also feel like i have no fucking friends. i used to have all these close friends, not the fake kind.. the kind that listens to you when youre crying and does shit for you and you do shit for them. i have like, 2 people that ever listen to me or call me and want to do stuff with me  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! ALL OF YOU, STOP BEING DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL! so many people have tried to kill themselves in the last week, and EVERYBODY is depressed! wouldnt that be wierd if they made a biological disease that made you depressed and suicidal? people who set it off could make the whole world commit suicide. anyway.  it's like, 9:20. i think im going to go to bed, so ill stop feeling so gross and like im going to puke.  ~abby
