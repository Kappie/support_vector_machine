On Yahoo Chat, we played a game of Chess and he beat me, he was always better at Chess then me. We then stopped a while, for Dinner break on my end, and a breakfast break on his end. Then later that night he logged in on a computer with a web cam and I got to see him for the first time since I left Texas. It has only been 2 ½ weeks, but it was so good to get to see his face. I logged on to my web cam and he got to see me as well. He told me that I was very beautiful and he was very happy to get to see me (I am not too sure why he felt I was so beautiful, my hair was messed up and I was in my pajamas). We had a really good talk about what we were going to do when he got home, if he had thought about coming home on leave, how he was doing, how I was doing, etc. I hope that we can do that again real soon. It is amazing to think of how much we have advanced in technology, that now when my husband is on the other side of the world, I can still see him.  In other news, AKO (ARMY Knowledge Online) has locked me out of my email account. I am not too sure why but hopefully someone will get back with an answer. I had to update my password the other day and now it isn’t letting me in to check my email. I called their help desk and was on hold for 45 minutes and gave up and sent an email to them instead. I am getting frustrated and hope that someone will get back to me soon.   I guess on the bright side of things my blog still works.
