After class I had to go to Target and get a going away gift for my friend who is moving to sunny Florida.  Then I come home with food to watch the Pacers lose to Detroit in the last minutes of the fourth quarter.  Why does this happen to me?  Cubs choked just before the World Series, the Colts choked a game before the Superbowl.  Now I can add the Pacers to that list.   "Maybe Next Year"   Grrrrr.  I don't want to have to say that anymore.  Flim, Flam.  I'll be ok.  I still have Notre Dame to do me good.  Ba hahaha.  Tonight is another exciting night of class.  Three and a half hours of review.  I'm missing Sod, and it's only been a day and a half.  :-(  I hope he is having fun on the road and, even though he is going to the Motor City where it's all about the Pistons, he should have a good time and maybe he will wear a Miller jersey?!?!  OK, enough, I have to go before I get mad all over again.   Peace.Love.DMB.    16 days !  Glow Sticks Here I Come!!
