Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly to and fro across the jar.  				RANDAL (O.C.) 			(mumbling Jaws theme) 		Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM! DA- 		DUM! DA-DUM!  DANTE and RANDAL are on a freezer case. RANDAL pushes this chip around the jar of salsa. DANTE stares up at the ceiling, oblivious.  				RANDAL 		Salsa shark.  DANTE says nothing.  				RANDAL 			(as Brody) 		"We're gonna need a bigger boat."  DANTE says even less than nothing.  				RANDAL 			(as Quint) 		"Man goes into the cage; cage goes 		into the salsa; shark's in the 		salsa; our shark."
