But on the other hand, It's wrecking my kidneys. I also have to be on oxygen, and I'm really pale,with the darkest circles under my eyes that you could imagine.    I Have a really hard time with some people in my grade. Some of them are very ignorant, and think this is all an act to get attention. ( they are obviously not very close friends.) While others, are wonderful, always kind, and wanting to know how I am feeling. I don't know how to explain it. It's just nice to know you have people that care about you. At times it feels like I have no one and wonder why I am even put on this planet, But I know God has a plan for me. I'll write More later. Thanks for listening!
