I am gaining some weight back.  I feel very alone and discouraged. But you know what,  I don't care and I am allowed.  I feel like a failure these days.  I have put out my hand for friends to hang to and it has been refused.  Boy that is a hard one.  I feel helpless and depressed.  It doesn't help that I keep forgetting my meds....  Around me is caos and I don't care.  So here didn't his little story cheer you up.....  Happy Sunday
