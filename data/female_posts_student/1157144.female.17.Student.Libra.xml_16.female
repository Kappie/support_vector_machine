But then, if someone wants to take me to Tahoe a day early, that'd be even better.        Jessie: i really shouldn't laugh, so i won't          Beth: i think your lovely suggestion needs a bit more loveliness around the trim...also, i'm mad about the hist notes too. I was considering downloading all of them a while back, but got lazy and didn't think they would ever go down         Mandy: what the heck?           Maggie: staying up until after midnight when coming off an addiction isn't the best thing to do           anyone else who is still reading: i imagine track practice starts next week, so if i was going to give you a ride (in which case you didn't tell me about it yet and i'm just doing this before you do), i can't until around 4-ish          Me: stop using parenthesis and -ish stuff
