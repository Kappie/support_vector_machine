Sparring is so awesome, it's full contact fighting for all of you who don't know. You go and put on all this equipment, and you look like a marshmallow man, and then you just fight people. You always get hurt some how or another, my first time I got kicked in the jaw...hard, but somehow it's always fun. It makes the non-contact that we do in the regular classes seem really dumb. But yeah travel, competition....great stuff.  In other news, I'm going to VA tomorrow to visit everyone. My niece if 5 months now...and she has 2 teeth, and almost crawling! yayyyayyay! My teeth however are annoying me, I keep cutting my tongue on one of them, it's strangely very sharp.   Farewell
