I also got a really nice cell phone. It's very pretty and shiny and new. Besides that, nothing has happened. I sleep, I eat, I watch Sailor Moon DVDs, as well as movies that I own. That's basically all that I've done the past four days. Ooh, but I DID go to Ardmore this evening. I went to April and Sam's to drop off DDR, then on to Ardmore to McDonalds and hung out with everyone there. Joe tried to get me to go out with Rusty. Though, he tries to get EVERYONE to go out with Rusty, so I'm not taking it personally. It was so good seeing everyone today, I've been so lonely this summer.  For some reason, I've been really ill ALL week. I mean, really wierd things trigger it off too. I just....I just want to say really hurtful things to everyone. well, not everyone.....just a few people. And these people don't do anything wrong. I'm feeling angry right now too, but I don't know why. Maybe I'm just in an angry mood and I need to let off some steam. Majorly pissed for NO reason. ohhhh, I'm just glad I didn't feel this way driving home.  Why can't I just have a COMPLETELY normal day for once, were I don't feel sad or pissed off?! ah, I'm cursed, I swear I am. Okay, I'll get over it, hopefully. anyways, gonna go now and calm down.
