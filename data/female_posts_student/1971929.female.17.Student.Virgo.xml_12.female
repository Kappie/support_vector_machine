I was able to keep entertained for about 45 minutes reading short stories by Ross and his friend Phillip. Alas, the short story flow has ceased and I am left with no form of stimulation. Of course, I can always turn to my old fried Food. Oh, wow, I eat way too much. If I keep this up, by the end of the summer I'll have gained like 20 pounds. I don't like being fat. I was fat a few years ago. Well, not exactly fat, but pudgy. Pudgy Pudgy Pudgy. I'd hate myself so much if i were fat. I used to be horribly afraid of fat people. It's amazing how most of my fears, past and present, have to do with people. I don't understand how I'm afraid, but I am. I feel really bad about it, but it's not like I choose to be afraid of it. I have like the weirdest fears ever. If anyone can think of anything their afraid of that's stranger than old people, let me know so I won't feel so weird. The cats are fighting. It's funny because they'll be clawing at each other, then turn to run and smack right into a cabinet or something. Then every few minutes they take a break to lick themselves, which I find rather amusing as well. You know what I haven't had in a really long time? A Chicken Burger. I should really get me one of those. If only I had money... OK, now the cat fighting is getting kind of annoying. I mean, them running into things can only be amusing for so long. We're going to try to do the garage sale this weekend, but according to my fkoibn RFBG['P  Gah! cat on the keyboard... anyway... according to my father it's supposed to rain this weekend. So I'm not sure that the garage sale will actually happen. I hope it does. I just want it to go away.
