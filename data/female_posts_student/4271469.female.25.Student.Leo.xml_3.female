Likely, she'll have more to say than me.  Maybe it will be theaputic to vent here rather than in each other's face.  Maybe not.   As of today, August 19th, 2004 this is where we stand:  1.  We have no wedding date, although May 30th, 2005 has been discussed. 2.  We have no wedding location, although some place in the Santa Monica mountains has been discussed. 3.  We have no budget although 20K seems reasonable to Jay.   On to the high and the lows....
