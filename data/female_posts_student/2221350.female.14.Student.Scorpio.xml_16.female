Mom picked me up from school early and we had taco bell((wood!)) but in exchange for skipping French class I had to help her spread mulch on the flower beds. Aside from pulling something in my shoulder, that didn't bother me one bit. Probably because I got to hit giant bags of wood chips with a sharp shovel until they burst open((mom offered to draw a picture of morehead on the bag for me. hehe)), and then throw it all over like confetti... a really great way to relieve tension if you ask me. Then I made some iced tea that is so strong you can't see through to the other side of the glass, just the way I like it.  So today wasn't so bad, and it's  a good thing .  Right this very second I think I would give my left nut for a rice crispy treat, too bad for me I don't have any nuts to be giving away. I love those little things! They are by far the best dessert not to mention lower in fat than most sweet treats. They're so chewy and sweet and wonderful! ---so I have a thing for rice crispies, back off bucko!  I am quite cheery but also quite tense. I think I will go take a shower.  Then I'll watch general hospital.  Then I'll turn my amplifier up to 99 and make  Siamese-cat-in-heat/happy-hump-back-whale noises, that always seems to relax me... For some reason. ((that was a pretty bad joke))  ((wAaAaAaAh))((mo0o0o0o0om))((twangety twang))
