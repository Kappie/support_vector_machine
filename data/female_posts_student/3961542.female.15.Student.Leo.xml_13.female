I saw my two divine bitches and endured many hours of cardio and weights.     After we descided to visit our dear friend 'twin of fin' Roisin....who seems to have grown a sorta semi afro type thing......     After a session of talking on hot tarmac,we did what every sane person does.....goes and sits in the middle of a round-about.     If that aint normal then what is?     Old men on bikes really shouldnt be allowed to ride such things on the road....its a health hazard!     Anyhoo,     After several hours of random chit chat, we dragged ourselves home.        Sounds fun doesnt it?        Goodbyb!          [edit] Welcome back 'Peewee' dearie...                Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
