We repainted the 2 posts, and then we just did utter randomness on the third post. It's such awesomeness, really. ^_^  O_o  Oh holy sweet goddamn...okay, I just typed up what I've written for the Convictions essay, of which I've only written an Intro and started on the Gobitis case as my second paragraph, and my Word Count is up to 422 words already....and Wally says 500 words is the minimum. >_
