I'm really bored and I sort of feel lonely. Love is a crazy and complicating thing. People say its a totally kick ass awesome feeling but to be honest, I'm beginning to question that. No one is ever really in love. Sooner or later you get hurt. For me, it was a little later. Sigh. I just miss all those good times Joe and I had you know? We had a lot of them. But then again, we had a lot of bad times too. And then my parents were a factor to our breaking up. It was probably for the best though. I mean, now that I look back on it, he wasn't the best out there. Even my best friend thought I could do better. Though she never said anything until after Joe and I broke up. At least she kept it to herself unlike some people. *cough my parents cough* But whatever. It's done and over with now. No use dwelling on it right? And besides, I'm going to a different school this year so there'll be tons of more guys to fall in love with. Mwhahahahaha. Love ya! *mwah*
