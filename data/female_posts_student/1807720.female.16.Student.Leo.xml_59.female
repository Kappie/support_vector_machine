I realized that she CAN actually know and realize what others are feeling, and for onceI felt like she tried to understand where I was coming from.  For once I feel like I told her my honest opinion about how I really feel about her classes and stuff and it feels good to get it all "out there."  I mean I am still confused about alot of the stuff in Chem. but well I felt like she actually was NOT rude at all today and took her time going through the quiz and stuff so I would understand.  And when we were doing the lab she was like "good work girls" and like usually she gives us a lecture about how to "propery" do something but today she just told us we were doing good work.  She is sooooooo much more considerate and much more nice.  Tonight I was doing my homework for Chem. and I was doing those titration calculations/problems and like at first I totally did not think I could do them at all.  But then I thought about what the chem teacher had said, what she basically asked is that "When you see a question that you might think you don't know how to do or confuses you do you panic or get scared?"  When I thought about that, the truthful answer is "yes" and then she was like "Well you can't let that get to you and you have just got to go with what you know and don't let that panic you."  So tonight I looked at this worksheet we got and like freaked and thought I could not do any of the questions, but then I thought about what she had said and well I started just to try doing the questions based on what I knew and stuff and and trying to put all the info together and since she gave us the answers for the questions I could check my work and I actually did do a couple right and there are only a couple questions that I need to ask her about.  I feel that she actually can be really nice, and can actually be really understanding.   I saw a totally different side of her today.
