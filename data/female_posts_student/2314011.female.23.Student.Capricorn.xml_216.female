Even though I made it a point to come out to the parents, it was never on the agenda for the grandparents.  The reasons are pretty obvious, but chief among them are: they're from a different generation who wouldn't be, how you say, understanding? tolerant? kind for the sake of appearances? It's all I would be to them; everything else about me aside, I would for all time be The Gay.  And as much as I want my last few years with them to be spent in that space, I don't.  It's basically the same reason I didn't come out to my parents until I moved out.  I knew the last year under the same roof would be consumed by the Gay Curse, a struggle they weren't going to win and I was unwilling to put us all through.  So, because of that decision, I never felt the need to tell any of my extended family because word spreads like wildfire in this family.  Especially this kind of news about one of the two Golden Children.  Also, the parents have such a time with it themselves that to have anyone else in the family know could put them in the awkward position of discussing it with people they know are sizing them and their kids up, something I've always tried to save them from, even though I know it's not my responsibility.    But as we've all grown up and become adults, where the 10-year difference in age means less than it did when I was 14, I've found myself wanting to be friends with some of the cousins.  We've shared bottles of Captain Morgan.  I talked with Michel (the hot husband) for many drunken hours the evening we first met and the next year he made me promise to read the Lord of the Rings...something not even Levi could manage.  Teressa (the bride) and I sat in the corner of Heather's wedding shower two years ago, having never really known her my entire life, cackling, poking fun and relating to each other in a way I've never felt with another family member.  Trish (the wonderful wife) has always been a favorite among my immediate family and she's been opening up more and more during the last few months about her frustration with her in-laws.  And so, I was looking forward to the after wedding wedding party Saturday night with all of these people.  At last, we would be free to be ourselves without hiding in the back or running after the kids when they whine or turn blue.  And part of me wished The Subject would come up, if only to share something with these folks I wanted to be more than just related to.    But I didn't want it coming up at the wedding itself, so I decided against the cropped pants that went with the outfit I planned to wear for the occasion.  Figured I could throw 'em on afterward and the tattoo riding a half-inch below the fabric would go unnoticed...or at least un-commented-on.    My eyes must have dropped onto the table when Rob blurted out:  "Andrea, do you have a tattoo?" at his sister's (Heather) monstrosity of a new house, with my mom to my left.    "Yes," I answered out of my tight lips, one foot covering up the other ankle.  "How long have you had that?" he persisted.  "Since I was 18."    Now DROP IT!!  my tone said.  "You have a tattoo?" Trish asked from across the room.  And somewhere, thankfully, the subject was shifted and all I wanted to do was change out of these damn pants, but made do with holding said ankle in my hand.  Later, the folks and I made an appearance at Bride's parents' barbecue.  As I made my way out front to wait for the ride to the piano bar downtown, Aunt Becky (Rob and Heather's mother) asked: "Is that a tattoo around your ankle?" (Starting to see the connections?)  "Yup," I said, not seeing the connections, just thinking it really  is  that noticeable when it's not covered.  "I haven't seen that before, how long have you had that?"  "Since I was 18."  "The colors are so pretty."  "Yea, I like 'em."  Finally in the van on the way to the evening's plans, I felt more out of place than I have in a long time.  Surrounded by 35-ish people who have just bought brand new homes, are starting families without a hair out of place just didn't make me feel like me.    But a few laughs, drinks and raucous songs later, things were looking up.  And when Michel "innocently" brought up a woman's (the one our table had been making fun of for the last 4 songs because she wouldn't get off the stage) tattoo, I was ready to have this out.  So, he became the first.  He asked when I knew, how the parents and Joe were, if there was Anybody; said he was proud of me; told me everyone already knew (although I never got around to asking who 'everybody' is); joked about it in the way we love; promised to be discrete.    Just as I was learning to breathe again, Rob called me over to his end of the table, asked about the symbolism, apologized for earlier, reassured and hugged me in a way he never has before.    Trish interrupted to ask "What are you two talking about?" and told me I'd be joining her for a smoke outside.   Sure, what the hell?   It started with "So what were you talking to Rob about?" and quickly became a ranting session about her in-laws.  30 minutes in, she let out a long breath and said: "I'm sooo glad you're here."  "Really?  I always feel like the little kid."  "NO!  Don't feel like that.  I love your family!  You guys are so real!"  And before long, I was struck by the fact that here I was again, being the listening, reassuring one, bonding with someone over  her  troubles, when the whole purpose for our time together was for the opposite.    She seemed to realize this all of a sudden, saddled her body up next to mine and said: "So, what's going on with  you ?" with a smile that told me she knew exactly what my answer would be.  "Oh, I think you already know."  She just looked at me for a second before saying: "Why are you so quiet about it?"  Cue update on the Parent Situation.  She never skipped a beat and was nothing but the calm, sweet, wonderful woman I've loved since we met, even though she was incredibly drunk and more loose than I'd ever seen her...which actually just made me like her all the more.  "Is it just your parents?"  "Well, no...it's the grandparents, too..."  "I KNEW IT!!!"   "Yea, that one's not hard to figure out."  "If it were me, I wouldn't be so quiet..but then, I'm a rebel." which she's totally not, but okay, we'll go with that for the moment.  "It's all I would be to them.  If I had someone, that would be a different story..."  "You would say something then?"  "Absolutely; if I had someone I wanted to bring home..."  "Okay, good."  "But I don't.  And there's no reason for me to be out and proud for the sake of it when 'that' would consume the last years I have with them."  "Yea..that's true."  "Hey you two!  The party's  inside !!"  Teressa said as she burst through the doors.    The three of us went on a hunt for more cigarettes and nary another word was spoken about the issue.  Rob and Trish walked me to the hotel an hour later and I re-lived the evening all night in my half-dreams.    The drive home was consumed by my hangover, the intense sensitivity that accompanies said hangovers, the enormity of the evening before and knowing I had to tell the parents the cousins knew, no matter what they would say.  It could have been anything, really.  From Mom's patented "You will be the death of me, child" sigh, to outrage, to anxiety and "What are we supposed to do/say NOW?  I'm sure the whole family knows!!!"  But anything would be better than hearing "Guess what Becky said to me..."  And so, I ended up having the best conversation about the whole thing Mom and I have ever had.  Spent the night on the futon, curled up with a stress-victim stomach, talking with Miss Viscious, attaching words to what the last few weeks have said loud and clear.    The haze of the whole thing has lifted slowly over the course of the day, not coincidentally along the same timeline as the release of this month's hormones.  At least I know I won't have to worry about getting pregnant at Pride.    As the nerves calm, and the raw, exposed sensation fades, I'm left feeling stronger, closer to my family and shaking my head at the band of color around my left ankle.
