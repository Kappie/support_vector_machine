"did you notice how the white jewels look like those dumass tylenol pills that disintegrate in your mouth so you can't swallow them without undergoing immense torture? damn bastards..."-vanessa, as we were playing bejeweled.     yes, vanessa, you/your funniness was the highlight of my day. oh, besides the fact that sarah's letter  finally  arrived in the mail today...wheeeeeew. it's sweet. she sent me pictures, too. [love.]      well, i'm off now...to do nothing. word.      lata skata. (yeah that's right. it's gangster, only not.)      i think that i'm just scared to live.      kayte.
