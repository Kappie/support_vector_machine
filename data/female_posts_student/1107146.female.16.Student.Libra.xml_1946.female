There is only one word for this. Well, three. " what the hell ". Not as a question, either. I'm just saying what the bloody hell.  More than pissed Linds, fothermucking about to KEE-UL somebady. That is some shit if I've ever heard it.   Hell. I forgot what I came here to do. Check email, that's it. And the BLog always happens to follow.  So...I've got guns. Who's up for a nice trip to Meggie's?  *click*
