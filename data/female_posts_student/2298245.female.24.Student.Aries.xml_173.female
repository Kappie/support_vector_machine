I seem to always be caught wanting something And not able to articulate it Or willing to ask for it Or even mention it at all For fear of upsetting the balance The way people see me The way I want them to see me Which is not the way I see myself Or the way I really am. For if people could see me, I mean really see me They certainly wouldn't like what they saw And they'd run from me Or never speak to me again, And then I'd be alone. Only I already am. Alone because no one knows me, No one sees me, I won't let anyone in And won't let anyone out of what I want them to see. And I hide when I cry, Until the crying passes and I can once again face the world, The world that doesn't even know I exist Where people meet me only to forget me, Because I don't want them to remember, Because remembering is knowing. So sometimes I think I try to hard. And at the same time, not hard enough.
