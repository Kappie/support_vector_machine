Well haha my exams finally finished, I feel so relaxed! Happy! Its time for champagne and fire-crackers.... haha.   Well today I must say that everything went well... ok larz.... well today I had two papers.... Geography and DesignTechnology... well I was mugging like crazy from 3pm to 2am for these two papers ESPECIALLY DesignTech cos I always manage average, if not horrendous marks for this particular subject! And to make matters worse, it's streaming year and I need the marks to pursue a pure sciences course... preferably the triple sciences of course... cos I lurve Biology and maybe in the later future, I would like to enter the NUS Medical Faculty. Haha... well enuff of the crap. Now, where was I?  Yes, where was I? Yes! Aha, I think I was touching on the topic on my exams today. Ok so lets start with the 2nd last paper... which is .... GEOGRAPHY! It's my ultimate favourite subject! I like studying about the Earth and touch on geological issues like Deforestation and Environmental Crisis... only this time it is harder for my school is like, erm.... kiasu and I have to borrow a Sec3 Geog Elective textbook and read in advance, to be more far ahead than my peers. So I memorized this and that until I went ABSOLUTELY crazy,so much so I mixed up the causes of Environmental Degradation and High-tech farming and blahblahblah.... but it was fun! I dont remember studying so hard for my exams before... haha it is very competitive even if I am in a to-be autonomous school... dont mess with us! Oh yar, so I swapped and alternated every hour, 1st hour dedicated to Geog and the 2nd hour to DT and so on until I was dead beat... Duralumin.Pewter.Antimony,Copper and Maganese, High Carbon Steel 2%-4%..... and so on.... yes, my mind was filled with all these stuff. Ok and so when I went for the exam, I wrote everything I memorized down, until my hand was oh SOOOOO sore.... lucky feizhao was our invigilator, I was still writing when she went to collect papers! In fact everyone was.... a lot of people can't....>{pause for a while] Gotta go.... I will continue soon! Have tuition! Bye! {Yes Dad i AM CUMING, PLEASE STOP YELLING!]
