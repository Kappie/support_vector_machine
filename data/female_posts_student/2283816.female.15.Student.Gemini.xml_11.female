I'm thinking of writing about the relationship between Jem and Atticus. This is also kickass.  If anyone ever reads this, I'm spurning ideas off here. Want one? Credit me.   - Three-sided - Atticus, Scout, and Jem. Family. - Aunt Alexandra voicing concerns on Scout and Jem. - Miss Caroline, voicing frustrations on Scout. - Miss Maudie, as she works in her garden. - Boo Radley, skirting throughout his house, watching Scout and Jem and Dill. - Dill, on how he's almost jealous of Scout and Jem. - Atticus, on protecting his children and Tom Robinson. - Tom Robinson, hearing the verdict of his trial. - Jem, about how he admires his father.   Oh, screw. Someday I'm going to write all these poems. I love these characters so. They're so rich and colorful and developed, and well-rounded, and brilliantly vibrant. I LOVE THEM. My entire soul loves them. I want to live in Maycomb.   That said, there are about fifty thousand other things I should be doing. I've memorized the bulk of my lines. I've scared Joe at least twice, with my overdramatic leg-grabbing. That's actually pretty damn fun, for those of you who have never grabbed Joe's legs before. *snickers* Oh, man. That is SO, so wrong. Damn mind. Too much time in the Sark Harem. They rub off on me, I tell ya.  The first person to tell me they've read this gets a bag of M's. No, I am not shitting you. LOL.   My life is so damn sad.   In other news, the new Lemony Snicket book, The _________, should be out soon. No, I do not remember the title. Hack into my email and tell me. I'm too damn lazy. And this "Happy Club" song is really annoying.  The Community Notebook is kind of like a Blog or a Live Journal, if you think about it. People come in and post, aka write, their thoughts, and others comment. Funny how it all comes out in the Chinese laundry. Ahh, much better. Suite from The Parent Trap. Much better.   I've been talking for a LONG time. I rarely ever write this much anywhere. M sound SO damn good to me right now. I want to run to the store and break all pretences of a Lenten resolution and just CHOW. I'm cold. It could be how I am sitting here in khakis, a sweatshirt and a tank top underneath, but you never know. Could be the house.  Alias is finally, finally on tomorrow. Blowback, that's what it's called. A Lark scene, and a scene with Sarkster saying "If you love her, you will put the gun down." I love the way he says it. So damn SEXY. Sark is synonymous with sexy. I swear to you. Okay. Goodbye for now, fair minions. You know you all work for me anyway.
