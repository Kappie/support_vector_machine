Last night, we got back to the hotel around 10:30 or so and Karen, Ashlynne, Courtney, and me were in our hotel room, which was adjoined with the 3 Jessica's, Chelsie and Brittnay's room. Lindsey was also in our room but she was visiting Shannon's room at the time. Well, me and Karen, Ashlynne and Courtney were watching SNL and then Brent and Jeff decided to come too. Well Jeff was really really slap happy. He was half asleep on the bed and then he got up and walked in front of the tv. He just stood there with his arm resting on it and we were like "JEFF! What are you doing?! You're blocking the tv!" and then he like jumped, I'm pretty sure he like dozed off or something. And then he sat on the bed and fell off. He was like a drunk person. And then Karen called the other girls room and pretended to be like a stalker person. Chelsie was like "did you guys call our room just now?" and we were all like "no...we're watching tv" it was great. And omg, our joke the whole week was we'd find sugar packets that said "sugar" on them and we'd be like "hey, you lost your nametag" and hand them to people. It was so funny, well, to us at least. Oh yeah, and after being in Missouri for 4 days, you will gain a southern accent, and it will be hard to lose. LOL!!!!   Yeah Ebonics...we call him Ebo for short. *secret handshake*
