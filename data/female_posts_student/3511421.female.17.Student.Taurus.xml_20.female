In someways my life is this vaccuum of nothingness, things are just sucked right through and contribute to this big ball of nothingness. But sometimes I step back and say wow, everything about this life is so weird, so then again everything and anything is probably worth it to me. Yes, yes, i will admit it. I am easily amused, why else would I have this thing. I despise the idea of "an online diary". So NO! this is nothing of the sort. It is only let's say a 'log' of rants and ramblings of yours truly. No, I will not erupt every single detail of my day onto the screen because I understand that NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. This is for my own amusement or relief. Whichever I choose. I shall write, I shall copy, I shall deliver news. Any questions?
