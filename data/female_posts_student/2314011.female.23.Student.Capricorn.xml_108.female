Classes, homework, and media board were all dealt with swiftly, deftly, without breaking a sweat, and yoga perfectly mixed challenge and ease.  I rock at tree pose, I have to say.  Found myself planning the rest of my evening in the meditative corpse pose when I should have been focusing on my breath and thought:  "I'll end up eating a burrito, reading the pleading and Rule 23 while listening to the new mix; it will be waiting when I get home."    The only addition to that picture has been the chai tea and a couple extra surprises in the envelope.    And each new song finds my jaw on the floor and a "SHUT..UUUPPPPP!!!  HE.DID.NOT.PUT.THIS.ON.HERE!!!" on my lips.  Think this might even have November beat, which makes me all the more excited for the Spring Mix.  I shudder (not unpleasantly) when I think about the inevitable Summer Mix Volume II.    Let's solve the world's problems with mixes, honey!  Forever!  On Cherry Avenue!  CHERRY AVENUE ON THE VAGINA MIX!!  LOVE IT!  And then we'll hit 'repeat' and do it all over again!
