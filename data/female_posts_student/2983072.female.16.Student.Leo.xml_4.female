Like right now, this instant...The great nani-fox commands it considering I'll probably never use factoring or polynomials or jigginomials or whatever funky names these thingies have.  *sighs* it's my first day of school. 10th grade at Tarpon Springs. Woo-hoo for me. Yeah go to all honors classes nani, they say, we'll be sooo proud of you nani they say. Bleh, I'd chose American idol over algebra anyday. All core classes on the same day means hw day in and day out too...Which reminds me ...I still have Spanish work too  *sighs again* I'm gonna have to stalk my teachers well mainly my math teacher. I think I'll pin her down to the desk and have her explain every thing in lamens terms for me, then maybe I'll get it. Here I come lookin like an idiot bakabakabaka    lalalalalalalala  tomorrow ill feel better for sure, I just can't wait to get up at the crack of dawn and face my doom. On A better note hiya .... Welcome to my blog thingie.. Please enduge in the imaginary cookies and juice I'll hand out now. Many have been nagging me to write a blog considering I'm a bagillion miles away from what I used to call home ...Charlotte *sniff snfiff*  So here people knock yourself out (lord knows some of you need it) nani's blog has officially begun expect weird and squishy things to come.
