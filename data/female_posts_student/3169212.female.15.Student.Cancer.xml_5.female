Andolin was supposed to meet him at this avenue, yet she wasn't here.  His short nerves were breaking.  He had been stood up before, by women he thought he loved, but Andy was his partner in crime and a fellow elf.  So what if she were a thief, she still had an honor code that she upheld.  He folded his arms across his chest and closed his eyes.  Elves had very sharp eyes, but they were very delicate.  Many elves prowled around at night, and did not enjoy the bright sun as the humans seemed to.  Suddenly Briar was pulled into the alley behind him by his collar.  The force threw him off balance and he fell onto the dirt ground.  It took only half a second for his vision to clear, and to see the shadowy form staring out into the crowded street.  He blinked a few times.  The figure was dressed in the clothing of Escalace, the Western Kingdom.  The character wore a black Veil to hide its face except for the eyes, with dark colored clothing.  The Westerners were often distant to outsiders, and weren't very sociable amongst themselves.  It was rather unnerving to be in the presence of one.  Of course, Andolin came from Escalace, so Briar was used to the prowess she held.  "Who are you?"  Briar stared at the Westerner.
