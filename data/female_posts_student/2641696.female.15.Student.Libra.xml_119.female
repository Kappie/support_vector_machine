Got an awesome unique vinyl thing for my car =D Yayy Need for Speed: Underground!! Hehe. I think the only reason I play it is because my dad is super-bad and I enjoy rubbing it in. *cackles evilly*    Do you know, I am very mad at A and B because neither of them have   REPLIED   to my Ren Faire email???    By the way, if anyone else is interested, just ask about it. Basically a lot of people (don't worry, you don't have to!!) run around in costume and talk with a half-decent Elizabethan accent. Lots of funny funny funny shows, lots of shopping and sparklies, lots of food and even a huge jousting tournament ( not staged ) with these massively gigantic horses and these big guys all in armor swinging swords and stuff at each other. It's fun.    Lots of cool music-o, too!    On Tuesday I had my piano and harp lessons again... the harp one went rather well (considering I didn't practice what I was supposed to), but the piano was iffy. I think I'm getting so good at sight-reading mainly because I don't look at the pieces until the lesson itself. *sigh* They are so patient with me!! Actually, PN kicks out the students who don't practice, but he thinks I do (because I'm so fan-flipping-tastic hee). Yup. We still make fun of KH who never practiced once and was very very bad and ended up quitting because she found a piano teacher who basically lived in a better neighborhood. Oh please. There is nothing wrong with where PN lives. In fact, I love where he lives; lots of cute little houses, lots of little kids, a few punks/goths/scary teenagers -- all in all, a very family-friendly place. Of course, he's moving now, but ya know. It all works out in the end.    I am such a bookworm!!! I have read basically a book a day for the past week. It's kind of pathetic. A, have you heard of Andre Norton? I'm not sure if I like her or not... I like her style of writing, but the plot/characters seem slightly cliche and even a bit *gasp*  boring . But apparently she's a classic and she won the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement. So Iunno. It could possibly just be me being a crappy book critic ^^;;; I still think everyone should read George R R Martin, though. He wrote the best fantasy books of all time. A, have you read those yet???? He is much too brilliant to be human. Oh, and read Neil Gaiman, too.  American Gods  and  Neverwhere  are my favourites...  Neverwhere  is super-funny and just all-round-GOOD (horror + humour + insanity -- WEE), and  American Gods  was just wow. I totally didn't see the end coming. I was very very surprised. That doesn't often happen to me. If you give me the starting sentence of a novel I can sometimes predict the entire story ^^;;; but the best thing was, it all fit; even if I hadn't thought of it, it all fit perfectly and that's just the best ending ever. So read it, and see if you can figure it out!!!    Of course, with my luck, some kid who's got the mind of a 3-year-old will figure it out and then spit on me.    Other than the fact I've been watching a strange amount of English movies lately, I think that's it. Oh, and  Le Divorce  isn't very good. But  Mickey Blue-Eyes  will always,  always  be the funniest thing since ever.
