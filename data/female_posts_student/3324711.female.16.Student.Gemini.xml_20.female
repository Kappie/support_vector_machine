NOTE: If your new at this game, Im only joking and I do this to amuse myself.       [What I Want For My Birthday]  Dreads  world peace.. thatd be neat. Jet CD a belt that works would be nice jeans.. these I need. or..pants like the ones Brads brother wore!!  YES  a sunny and warm birthday [I can hope..]  Anything to do with :  the 70s! Hot Hot Heat The Darkness Incubus! Pink Floyd! Ben Folds Grinspoon Kiss QOTSA RHCP Weezer ... and any other bands that I like.  I cant remember anything else right now. Ill add more later. Well Im off to guitar lessons..
