Now, I have decided to lay down some ground rules for the survival of this blog...thing. Cause right now it's looking pretty dead.      And why should the other members listen to me? Well, I made it, and I said so. So nyah.    RULES FOR WRITERS  1.) No more random cow insertions. I'm serious.  2.) No more huge fart scenes either. It just ruins things. 3.) Try not to repeat the same thing over and over again. It makes things more enjoyable. 4.) Try to have some sort of a compelling story. Please? 5.) Stories should really not run on for thousands of posts  unless  they are really good. And I mean  really  good.   RULES FOR READERS ( LOL J/K)  Ok, hopefully this should preventlong periods of time without new writing.   Whatever story was going on before this message is now terminated. I should have a new one up soon.  Hopefully no one is too miffed. ^_^()
