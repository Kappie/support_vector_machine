I cant stop smiling.. I finally know what its like to be completely happy and satisfied with life and everything that happens. I just dont know why i am so HAPPY! its grate. but yeah.. i guess this is stupid to read for all of you.    My mom used to say this to me.. maybe its stupid but i think its true.. idk   "Happieness is knowing that you are loved." and that was another deep thought from the mind of Ashly. whatever tho.. it works i guess. I've been thru alotta shat.. but its all ok cuz i have so many good things to cover all of it up. Cya next time, eich
