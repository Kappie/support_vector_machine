And I went a little nuts.  Cleanup was a bit of a problem because I have nothing along the lines of a rake or a push broom with which to pick up said clippings.  Since I'm not gardening-ly inclined (I had a plant once.  I had to give it up into foster care because I didn't feel like getting dirt on my hands to re-pot it) I also didn't know what was a shrubbery (if only Dennis the Shrubber were there...) and what was a weed.  So i cut back everything so clear a path.  And since I have no lawn mower (or really any lawn to speak of), I also used the clippers to cut down the height of the weeds in the back yard.  But again, since I have no rake, I'll leave them there until I can borrow one from my aunt (likely next weekend).    I did have one injury (minor as far as chainsaw-like power tools go): the vibration of the clippers gave me and popped a blister on my right middle finger.    I counted last night and since June 1,  I've read 11 novels .  They average about 400 pages apiece (minus the 650 pages or so of Infinite JEst I've read this month)  For those of you doing the math,  that's around 5,050 pages in June .  I'm desparately out of books to read (I have around 18 linear feet of novels and another 6-8 feet of references and text books), so please, feel free to throw a recommendation my way.
