Damn, I was just getting started, angling the blade just so, all slippery with this olive oil shave-goo, when Kriss Kross came on with "Jump!  Jump!"  I think, 'this must be a tag for a commercial; there's no way they're going to actually play the entire song.'  But no, the entire song blared forth from my shower radio (which I had to have because 25 minutes of relative silence was just unbearable).     Yes, most ordinary folks would find it high-near impossible to simultaneously shave  spazz out in a nostalgic booty-shake (at least not without slicing their legs to ribbons).  But me, well, I'm just that good.  Nary a nick or scrape... not even any missed spots!  Except for the knees,  who on earth can ever get knees completely smooth?!  I swear, I can go over them in 17 different directions and get out for the 30-minute lotion applying routine that blesses my day,  STILL find spots of stubble.  Grrrrrrrr!!!!!!  The plan was to Nair them (knee-nair, hehehe), but I keep forgetting.   Then there's that new lotion that's supposed to make the hair on your legs stop growing.  I got it, of course, because I'm a beauty-product-aholic.  But each time I use it, I wonder.  Don't bad things like radiation and illness make hair stop growing?  Hmmm... there's a pretty thought.  Ah well, we all have our stubborn vices.  You know, those smokers that say all tough:  "well, ya gotta die from somethin'!  you could get run over in the street tomorrow!"  Yep, that's me, with my leg defuzzing lotion... throwing caution to the wind!  Hey, ya gotta die from somethin'!  Why not from creepy lotion?  I'm such a badass.  Hey, that wasn't meant to be funny.  Grr.
