I'm getting kind of bored with it, and it looks like blogger has some cool new templates that they didn't have when I signed up.  Anyway, so if my links to blogs or other sites disappear at any point, this is why, and never fear, for they shall return soon enough.  I have a busy weekend planned (including, barring inclement weather, the Mississippi Picnic in Central Park on Saturday) as I have to get as much done as possible, since my family is going to be in town next week visiting, and I'll want to get to see them at least a little.  Anyway, all this is to say that the blogging may be light, but now that I'm back on the horse, there's no keeping me down for long.  In other words, I'll be back.
