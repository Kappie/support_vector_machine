When nothing makes sense, And your not completely whole. You don’t know why, You feel the way you do. You constantly wonder, But don’t have a clue. Everyone seems fine yet, You feel so confused. You feel mislead, Ignored and abused. You cant control these feelings, Or make them go away. We all have to deal, With our not so great days!!
