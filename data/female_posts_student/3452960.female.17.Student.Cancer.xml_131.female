For shame.  I am still waiting to see this reminder that Vicky put on my phone last night (I haven't looked yet!) and really can't be bothered to eat anything.. Damn alcohol.  In other news, I managed to actually tell my dog to bring me a lollipop about 10 minutes ago. How good is that? She didn't refuse to give it to me or anything! Now I just have to get her to bring me drinks.. ¬_¬  Also, now that I have my computer back, you can all start sending me stuff. Like photos :D
