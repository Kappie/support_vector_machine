It was really hot outside, and nobody wanted to play after a while, so I hit a few balls with some random tennis instructor at Big Woods and was told I should join the tennis team. Go figure. Then we went to Erin and Moe's and played ping pong and watched the Cubs game - I am still perturbed that they lost. Anyways. I'm so worn out from playing tennis for the past two days. I even fell asleep for almost 2 hours once I got home. Oh, yeah... And David still hasn't got the web portal working. Heheheh...     Last song I listened to:   Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Very Best Of Jethro Tull .    Last meal I ate:  Um... Some fruit.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I looked at a Woodwind  Brasswind catalog today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.
