Oh, there's this show called Dead Like Me.  Its the greatest show I've seen in a long time.  It's on DVD, Season's 1-3.  But season 1 is only the pilot.  That wasn't cool.  But I know your DVD player isn't hooked up, but if they have it on vhs you should watch it.  There's a lot of swearing and dark humor, it's great!!  Okay, that's all for now.
