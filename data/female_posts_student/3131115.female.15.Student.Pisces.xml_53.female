Anyhow, I made a new friend today. I named him Henry. Henry the Lobster. Although, what happened was..my mean daddy killed him and his brothers. My family is so mean. My dad fucked up and he killed them even before puting them in the boiling water because he wasn't supposed to put them in water he was supposed to freeze them. Oops. Oh well..Poor Henry. I'm going to miss you little buddy:-P. Okay, I'm pathetic...so ater my family ate Henry my sister brought me a pice of his leg and it's hanging on my wall. If I ever mention about my room starting to smell...maybe someone should remind me of it.   William and I never have anything to talk about on the computer. It sucks..we get on, and then we're in silence the whole rest of the time. I'm extremely tired and I want to go to bed right now, even though its only 7:45 or so. *blah*..today was a lazy day. All bill and I did was watch/play shit on NG's. I'm trying to talk my dad into letting me go to Warped Tour. I think that he's going to let me..hopefully.   It's really starting to upset me that I dont have any friends. I mean..Marrah is in Ohio, and her and I dont hang out anyway. Amber and I aren't talking and she's back being a stupif fucking retard with Brooke again, but..whatever..I dont really care I guess. I'm just feeling sorry for myself. My cousin came over, but that was just annoying and all she fucking did was want to take my cigarettes. So, I gave her some and she smoked them and she doesnt even inhale, which pissed me off because I have very few left. Yes, I've taken up smoking again..well, I have been for like 2 months or so..but..eh, I'm going to stop as soon as this pack is done..I hope.   Tomorrow my mom and I are going to start walking..4 days a week now. We're taking my dog and walking around Otsinango (?) Park...My mom wants to lose her stomach, so she says that if she does she's going to get her belly button pierced and she told me that I could get it done with her which is cool. I personally dont really like belly button piercings, but just getting it pierced will be fun. I pierced my nipple again the other day. It felt really good, and I want to do my other one..although, Its hard to get the rings in and I have to get better ones before I do it again.   Anyhow, I think Im going to go now...too much typing for only one post.
