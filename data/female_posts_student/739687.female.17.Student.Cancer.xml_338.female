And being so close to the bombings in Madrid...seeing all the candles in the train station and the streets...was quite humbling. Wednesday was also very humbling. Very awful, and it makes me wonder why such horrible things happen to such great people. I've been thinking about that alot over the past few days...and it really makes me sad to think about what a tragedy it was. I hate death. Death of cause by others...or by accidents. Like the deaths of those innocent people on the trains...like the death of my manager's 11 year old daughter in a car accident... I have a newspaper from Paris, and one from Madrid, that show pictures of the train accidents. The pictures that just kill me are the ones of the people. The newspaper from Paris showed these pictures of people...dead...lying in the destruction. And they are such normal people...they are all just like me. And it makes me scared to think that something like that could easily happen to myself, or the people I love and care about. It humbles me.  Anyways...back to the trip. I have to say that the most unforgetable place we visited was Morocco. It was amazing. We met this guy who took us across the border from the spanish territory (while muslims were yelling stuff at us in arabic, and the guy was yelling back, and I was scared for my freaking life), and then we took a taxi into the city. Oh my dear God those cab drivers are insane psychos. So once we got to the city, we walked inside the city walls, where people set up markets along the narrow walkways. The walkways were paved between tall buildings, and the city was like a dream. It reminds me of some sort of Aladin-like, arabian night kind of place. I can't even describe it really...you'd have to see the pictures. And of course we stood out ALOT. The country is a monarchy, and it's 97% islam. Yeah....you try to blend in. We then went up to the palace in the midst of the city, and as we were up there, we got to hear one of the prayer calls over speakers in the city. Many people went running frantically to go pray. However, Morocco isn't an immensely strict country, so prayer isn't always a requirement (if you have an excuse). My parents used to live in Saudi Arabia, and the women were required to cover their entire faces, except for their eyes, whereas in Morocco the women typically only covered their heads, leaving their faces exposed. Also, in Saudi Arabia, during the 5 prayers in the day, everything would close, and prayer was strictly enforced. After that, our 'tour guide' took us up on the roof of this building and gave us this absolutely amazing view. I took lots of photos. We had a view of all the city, and the casbah, and far past even. Then we went back down inside the building, and he introduced us to this Moroccan carpet designer. We all sat and had tea (a Moroccan tradition), and he went through his carpet selling skatch (yeah...it's not a word...but i'm sure you get the idea so who cares...but if you use it I swear I will rip your bloody face off), and my parents "discussed the price" of two carpets and raped the price down to less than a third of the original statement. Kick ass. Go mom. So then we went back outside and I bought some silk Moroccan scarves from a little boy. (Definately cheaper than shopping in Paris:-P) Then we had to get in a taxi and race back even faster than we had raced there to get back across the border and into another taxi so we wouldn't miss the last ferry back across the Strait of Gibralter to Spain. We made it by a matter of minutes. Sweet.  So yes...the rest of the trip was awesome as well, but I just thought I'd share that part, because it was really something I'd never been around before. I mean, I've been to big cities before, like Paris and Madrid, and I'd been to Europe before, and I've been to countries where I don't speak the language. But Africa was something new, and a country that's 97% islam is also quite...different. It was a very culturally enriching experience.  Well party time tonight cray-zayz. {crazies}
