It was fun, but all I could keep thinking was, "This is the last time all of us girls will be together for ten months." I'm going to miss Joanne so so much. I want her to go, because I think it will be the experience of a lifetime, and great for her, but I'm just going to miss her. I trust her so much, and that's really rare for me so there goes a person that I felt I could always talk to. We're all going to her house tomorrow morning before school, and she's going to make us pancakes! Yum! But, I just have this feeling tomorrow is going to suck like no other. All day, I'll just be thinkin, "Well, I guess Joanne will be leaving for the airport soon, I guess she's leaving now, I guess she's on the plane now." I jus wish I could postpone it a tiny bit longer. Just maybe..another day.   I can't decide if I'm angry or sad right now. I feel both. I think I'm more sad than angry, but I do still feel angry.   I think I just want to go sleep or do something to keep my mind off of it. I'm so scared I'll just start crying at school tomorrow. I don't cry often, especially in front of people so I really hope I don't. I'll be so embarassed.   And somehow this all just brings me back to Kari. I know Joanne didn't die, but still. I feel like I'm losing her. I know she's only going away for this year, but I feel like I've lost her forever. Like, I'll never see her again...and now I miss Kari. Man....why am I letting myself think about this??? I'm through.
