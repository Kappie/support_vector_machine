Gomen, gomen…… I wouldn’t have known if my friend didn’t tell me to read the comment part. ( thanks Alicia) I never check that for my own blog. Instead I always see what other people’s blog’s comment. Ha ha ha…  Exam is this Saturday!!!!! Ouch, teeth…painful….cannot….eat…junk…food…..so tempting… Anyway, I think I’m gonna have phobia passing up any work to my chemistry teacher. I passed up my “Lembaran Kerja” for chapter 2  3 and guess what happened to it. Lost! Ok, so I have to get a new copy and rewrite the answers. (Good for revision) I passed up my Laporan Eksperimen 6.2 and also she said I didn’t passed it up to her. My Lembaran Kerja for chap 4 also missing. She also hairan how come my stuff always went missing. Maybe someone thought that is a useless paper and used it to wrap nasi lemak since for the past few days I always see people eat it. Now I don dare to pass up my chap 5  6 since exam is just around the corner.       My father just bought a DVD yesterday. I know it's no biggie for all of u out there. He should have bought it before i went ot KL so i can buy the Sailormoon series-The last season- which is only available in DVD.  So sad. So sad.
