Yes, Maid Marion is mostly human; I was arguing in her defense on that one, and yours for that matter. And, wasn't Maid Marion was already a princess before she married Sir Hood? Probly just a slip-up.  And as to Belle and the technicality of being a princess, I did say: "I guess you could say she's one since Beast is a prince-thing if I recall, and that would make her a princess, marrying as such."  So, not a generalized justification, but it is a small justificiation nonetheless.  And again, here we are arguing about Disney characters. Hm.
