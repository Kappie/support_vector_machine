Does anyone else think that Nicole Kidman is an Ingrid Bergman lookalike?    I thought Bergman was fantastic--I'm sure my students will all think she's an evil femme fatale (and have a hard time explaining why she's working for the good guys), but I loved the way her character developed from a stereotypical movie-drunk to the almost tragic heroine we see at the end of the film.    My only complaint was that they had to stop the film three times to change reels... invariably as the suspense was building.
