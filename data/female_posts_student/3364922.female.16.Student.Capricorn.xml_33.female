(good for speed skating:P)    i told dad i didn't want to play superleague on sundays anymore.  he hasn't had a sad at me that big for a long time!  he's the coach you see, and for the last 8 weeks of netball i've only played half a game or less, which REALLY sucks, as i feel i haven't made any sort of contribution to the game or anything, so i decided to quit.    meh.    i'll miss it, but i'd rather not play, than only play half games every week.    one less day wasted in the week.    one more day to organise fun stuffs.    or to sit here.    hmm  i wish i could get some sleep...
