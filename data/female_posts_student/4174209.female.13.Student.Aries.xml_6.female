I was in a play called Banned Together and  urlLink  here   is it's website - or you could go straight to the Banned Together site  urlLink  here  . It was a super cool play!!! But I can't post the script because it belongs to 24 teens, not only me, and well, I don't think I really should, at least until it is completely copy-righted and everything, and well...you get my point. Also, if you look hard enough, you can find pics of me. I'm blonde and tall and wear white shoes with blue stripes on them. I'm on the front page. And I have a shot by myself, in a few pics I'm wearing a Snow Bunny shirt. Good Luck!!! If you ever hear about a musical called Banned Together - know where it came from - 24 teens who wrote it and performed it in 3 and 1/2 weeks!!!     -Sharpie
