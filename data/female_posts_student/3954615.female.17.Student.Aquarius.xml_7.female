I WILL NOT RETAIN!!!!!! YES! haha.. and here i am spending my time typing out all my innermost thoughts. my priorities are just not right.   oh yes. today.. had to pair up during chinese. my partner was sisuan. realised that our way of doing things is totally different. she has her own ways which i sometimes find it hard to accept. like the literature review and the chinese summary. i don't know what is wrong with me. that is definitely something wrong with me. i wasn't like this in the past. i was very tolerant, and i don't get flared up easily. nowadays there is a change in me. whenever sini they all started about the "pest", i'll get pissed off and started diao-ing everyone. then i'll began shouting here and there if things are not done the way i want it to be. this is totally unlike me. i can't seem to be able to control my tempers like i used to do it. and this is getting annoying. even if the people around don't sense it, i do. and this is irritating me. enough of this.  and in band, things are not any better. i am kinda influenced by huiqi's and benny's view about....... ok.. i better not mention his name. in case anyone happens to come across this blog and tell him about it. i can sense their biasness they have towards.. THAT GUY. and sometimes i do agree with them. there was once.. well, ms sia was teaching puileng on what she should do with the timpani, and the way puileng played the timpani was kinda weird. THE GUY and his gang of people, well.. maybe only one of his friend.. they burst into silent laughter and began to imitate puileng. that was the first time i see the evil side of them. and during sectionals, it is not that i am against him or something like that. but i don't like the method he approached. he often asked everyone to play one by one. this seems very unproductive and very time-consuming. sometimes, he also give me the impression that he thinks he is the best of all. but it is not the case. ok, he may be the best when it comes to playing, but he kinda sux at theory.. he used to tell us.. play concert Bb major, 2 scales. erm.. hello? 2 scales? ok, he meant 2 octaves. no one corrected him, but everyone understood what he meant. but now he changed already.. which kinda surprised me. i still think yanqing can teach better. she is more into detail and she uses the correct term. oh dear. haha, now it is so obvious who THE GUY is. i shall not harp on it anymore. time to bathe and work on my tutorials. Good night!
