In them you see rivers And veins you find Tolkiens Inspiration for the map of middle earth.  You can keep track of your movement In how many times you need to Roll over to  Answer the phone Grab a book   Right now is the reason You got the wireless keyboard and mouse set    A rested mind Is borne out of relinquished hope  Counting hours like days  Measuring success in failed  Suicide attempts   Ignore the  Hum of the t.v. And aspire to be too proud To pick up a phone  Remind yourself that hard work Is happening    Crave hugs like methadone  And then relapse  Into tears And fear  then kill something beautiful  Beg  for laughing prescriptions  Get through The next second The next minute  each day gets easier And asking for help is a step back  laugh at silly questions like…   What did you do today?   invested in a life worth saving  And  this as busy as it  gets
