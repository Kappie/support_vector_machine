I need a break, a change, to get away from all this here. It gets tiring after a while. And don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about!   Oh shit. I still need to register for Notre Dame. Ah, shiiiiit. I don't want to go by myself but I don't want to go elite either. What to do, what to do... ho hum.   Pointless entry. More later, perhaps!
