Ten minutes into the movie you will find yourself completely absorbed into the curious creatures offered by this world, and the mystical riddle-me-this poetic playfulness of the dialogue of which they speak. The story itself is one of legends. Nothing other then epic. The greatest scholars... even the most learned philosophers could, applying everything within their intellectual prowlness, do nothing more then merely skim the surface of the infinate depths which can only be known as Jim Henson's creative think-tank.   Having thought about this movie, many questions seem answered... yet many remain.   I have deducted that Sarah, the young girl and main charactor of the movie, is a symbol of childhood. One of which we can all relate. But what of the baby she journey's for? The baby is the duty, the responsibilty she hates but knows she must strive to secure in order to take the next step in her process of self actaulization. All through the movie she repeats "Because I have to" in reply to Jaroth's daunting pleas for her to stand down.  The Labyrinth itself represents the path from youth to inner growth and maturity, my Labyrinth was highschool, but the path may be taken many ways and hence... not all are the correct way, and not all journeyers succeed. Every landmark along the Labyrinth translates into a growing pain of socialization. Jeroth, the evil goblin prince which hold's Toby (the baby) hostage, is nothing more then the forces of peer pressure at work... because while he affects and causes all kinds of obsticals to appear and influences every creature who resides in the Labyrinth, he is defeated within his own castle at the end when Sarah realizes that "You have no power over me." His charactor is a direct physical manisfestation of this pressure, his revealing tight pants seem to hint at the need to show masclinality to the world, while at the same time being countered by his feminine hair (he has extensions) which makes reminds me of how we are expected to be all things to all people.  Every seemingly random encounter holds true to be the lessons learned, the personal revelations that must be made if you wish to reach the end of the maze. The old man with the flamingo bird sticking out of his head advises her that "Sometimes you have to walk backwards to get closer, but your always closer then you think" meaning that knowing your own faults and weaknesses actaully makes you stronger then those who fail to. Afterwards though, the bird demands a contribution to the old man, so Sarah gives him a ring... meaning the lessons learned often cost something: namely pride.  The pit of eternal stink symbolizes the lasting effects of a reputation gone wrong, as if any part of you touches it you smell horrible until death. Jaroth (peer pressure) threatens to throw Hoggle (love-deprived citizen of the labyrinth, i.e a class mate with self esteem issues) into this pit if he does not betray Sarah with the Peach of Forgetfulness. This peach is nothing more then an icon of self-concentration, as it distracts and makes you forget about your journey to self actaulization. Sarah falls prey to it and is sucked into a magical bubble of "im a self centered jerk" as she lives out her fantasy of being a Princess in a Fairy Tale complete with a smokey ball room scene... I ask you, how many girls have you met who are at this stage currently?  But it is only after she escapes this bubble when she realizes the material world is "just a bunch of garbage". Brilliant. All through this journey is the clock, an icon which appears time and time again to indicate the pressure to grow up as quickly as possible. I could analyze every second of this movie, but I will not. Instead lets move on to what I *haven't* figured out.   Why does the little overly zealous dog ride a larger dog which is mellow and cowardly? Is this some kind of symbol of political activisism, as only the people who speak out publicly are represented in government and hence, control everything about the larger group of silent people? Why can the Giant Ape Muppet thing beckon the command of boulders? And who are "the cleaners"?  Perhaps one day we'll have the answers... but until then, I invite you to come over and we'll watch it in speculation.  I'd even make brownies.  And now a song.   words fail  oblivious to the mirrors she's got for every angle you counter it with the sense of confidence you've bottled but when it all comes down when it all pans out there ain't nothing to be found in her there ain't nothing but the chance you missed the chance I can't repeat every song I sing that I can't complete and a mindless mediocrity I confess I confess I've been remiss I've been  too depressed to make myself this obvious cause when its all layed down when its over and out the me you see for me is only face deep so words fail they've been tossed around sunk like empty freighters run aground and chained to every future occasion  Copywrite **ME** YOU FILTHY SCAVENGERS!!! No copy/pasting! I'd have your retirement funds!! I swear!!
