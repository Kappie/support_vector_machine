So anyways, I've been back for a few days, and all that ignorant bliss of MB has already been pushed away by the miserable cruelty of high school.   *sigh*   I think I'm in one of my pissy-weeks, too. I am in an unusually bad mood, for no good reason at all. I just feel like it ^^; PMS? Maybe. *g* But it seems to occur a few times a year, especially in the winter, after Christmas and March break. Maybe I'm one of those mood-swingy people, unpredictable and rowdy.   Abruptly changing the topic, I want an 'I'm with Stupid' t-shirt. With the arrow and all.   I don't particularly have any more to say, except that my fingers are tired and I feel very... weak. Au revoir, a bientot and... yeah. Look out behind you.
