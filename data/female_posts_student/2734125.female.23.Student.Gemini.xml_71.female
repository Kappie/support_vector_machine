I set up camp, and felt a little guilty about that, but what the hell?  Its a grad lab, right?  I'm a grad student, right?  I have three papers due in the next six days, right?  I can set up camp.  So I set up camp, and played, wrote, and didn't write, and traded music, and got some food, and had conversation, and that is what the fuck life is about.  Fuck this thinking shit.  Its just that.  We need to breath, right?  Not worry about the next second and just be where we are, yes?  So a few beers later, I'm still in that place, but waffling on the quality of work that will emerge in my floating while sitting state.  High.  Why is that?  Do we never get low?  Do we never move down into the earth and find something more there?  Why do humans hold this secret need to get away, to move up, to move further from the moment and more into it?  In the darkness are we not also away?  In the hollow ground are we not also in the space, the second that is?  And what now?  What now that I am floating and spinning and moving within and without?  Where do I go when I am traveling in all directions?  I am thinking in every space, and sitting in every chair, and on the floor and the moon.  I am craving drugs and sex and that second that is not anywhere but where I am, and I am getting it at every moment of the day of late.  Playing it by ear, wondering where the next wandering will take me, and knowing that it will be into the moment.  Nothing else, no one else.  We sometimes glimpse that we are not the main character, and sometimes you say thank fuckin god that it is not about me, but in your heart, you know it is.  That other peoples words are just a tiny portion of the story, and the whole thing is about you.  So if I am writing from my point of view, and the whole story, the whole reason for being is to play a bit part in someone else's life, that the story is really about this other person?  That's bullshit.  I'm making a story, and my story is interwoven, and we are all making our own stories because there is nothing else to do really.  There is no where else to go with it but keep playing our part and hope someone, somewhere, might think that it is a story that is worth while.  That's all.  Its all that we can do.  And those moments, those moments of maybe, and no, and sometimes, and possibly and above all, YES, those are the moments that make the tale, that construct the essence, that is.  And yes, there is a meta narrative, and yes, we are all bit actors in that one, and yes, my story counts too, and yes, your story is just as important and just as valid, and that doesn't lessen any story.  We are not moving away from truth, we are making it, and we are drowning in it, and we cant see the ocean for all the fucking water.  That's the thing.  And thinking has left me, and drowning is becoming me, and the words that I read in that poem written a few hundred years ago are still truth to me, and no, I am not the evil in all the world, and yes, I am, because I can be both, all things, the ultimate grey, and that's okay for me.  Does what I say confuse you?  Does this speedy rant baffle you?  Then you are not my audience.  My audience are the ones that can listen and know that god and the devil, they came from the same seed, the same moment.  And my audience are the ones who can recognize that maybe, just maybe, birth and death are the same fucking thing, all wrapped up in one convoluted package.  Because you know what?   We are born to die.  We are born to die a thousand hideous deaths and not one of them is without a rebirth- not unless you let it be.  Not unless you lay down and choose to shut your eyes, and I wont buy it, and that is because the other day I was thinking about candles, and I was thinking about the energy in them.  You see, a flame is, your flame, my flame, all the flames that meet and part and steal and kill and give heart and heat and light and I was thinking, I was thinking that maybe, just maybe, there is something that happens when that flame goes out.  That lighter, that candle, that moment, and it is forced to be something more, because once the energy is in motion, well, it just cant cease to be.  Not until it is spend, its birth power changed into a hundred other things, not until it is gone in to the creation that is, the original birth light. This is how we know that there is a god, that we will not name as such, even though the naming is in us, and because it is so much larger then us- because the birth, the moment when all that potencial energy is centered in one space- space long enough to give life to a grub or a baby or a planet- because that comes together, and is given- then we know.  And what if that is pure luck, one second that the story is, so what?  Because we are moving in a universal dance that we will never really know.  Because we are moving in a sublte motion, one that makes us weep and quiver, because we cant separate it, but we can watch and listen and learn how to walk in tune with it.  We can learn how to ask and we will not be forgotten, because, frankly, and this will sound a little harsh but that's not the point, we were never remembered.  We are adrift and always tethered and there is nothing we can do but live an ordinary life in an out of ordinary way.  There is little to do but try to make our thread dance and stand out, tying and looping its way through a thousand others, making knots that the weaver wanted us to be in.  Be.  And we can do nothing but know that the spark of this body is what is keeping us tethered here, and that the things that we give gifts of life to, anger or love, punishment and hate, freedom and joy, well those are the things that we are supporting.  Those are the things that we are burning our life energy, our moment of clarity, our second of truth in this time and space on. Choose wisely.  Choose like your life depended on it, and don't be stingy because you are receiving as you give, not equal, but you cant know, and so live it up.  Live.  And when you get tired and start moving past this body, but not past the everything else that is, well know that you were giving to things that you loved.  I loved them with my body and soul and thought and moment and I caressed them and licked them and beat them and was consumed by them, and that consumption felt so damn good, better then anything I ever felt before, because it was something that I chose.  That choice is the only other thing we get, and all springs from that, and the energy we put out, its gone, and it comes in other forms, but that original imprinted lovely self, that false sense of the individual, well that is gone.  Its getting dark, and I'm clenching my teeth from the effort of telling you some truth that you may not see, and that you may not read as truth, but that I know to be a part of the whole, a portion that I have worked a thousand times for and considered a thousand more without moving from the same chair.  Frankly, it will all be gone, tapped, whipped, smacked and thirsty in the morning- but I am emerging and I continue and you wonder where it will stop, and its my choice when it does, and I am just too tempted to go all the way, to turn this into everything, and everything into nothing, and I will have power, and ultimate weakness to that power.  And I will let everything pass and touch all and nothing in a fluid motion that may be god, and then I will know that I have reached the stopping point.  Not till then, friend, not till it is over and done and my energy has touched and moved and been driven to the point of nothing will I fall into the whole, and until then, I will drink this wine and fuck this moment for all I am worth.
