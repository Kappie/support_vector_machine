Jennifer and Ricky think that a guy they work with (whom they refer to as "Scruffy Nick") is the perfect guy for me.  Well, not perfect, but someone who I'd take interest in.  I'm finding this odd.  Especially since Ricky couldn't really TELL me what qualities he thinks I think are important in a guy I'd date.  Anyhow, me and Jennifer went into Toys R Us today to go see Ricky and Druck, and so she could write their schedules down.  It was fun stuff...  I'm not supposed to reveal any details from while we were there... even though I think they're cute.  Okay, so... Jennifer's probably going to go to Warped Tour with me and Melissa... because Amy wants to go to the Paul Oakenfold rave that's going to be here on Tuesday night.  I decided not to go to the rave, because I'd rather use my money that I make tomorrow and Tuesday (from training) to buy t-shirts at the Warped tour AND at DMB... because I'm going to the concert on Saturday with my brother.  :-)  Yay... good times.  Anyhow... that's all for now... we're going to T-3 tonight... :-D  Good stuff.
