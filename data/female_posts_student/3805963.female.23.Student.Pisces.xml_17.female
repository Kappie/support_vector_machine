First couple of nights were my fault I admit, last night was just craziness, here I am, all set to go to bed at 2am, which is a perfectly good bed time for me 6 hours of sleep is just fine. Any less and I approach critical mass, start getting headaches and stuff. Kid has a nightmare and starts wailing, and now the house can't get to sleep until he does, which is right around 4am :( not fun.   I wake up at 8am, hit the snooze, thinking, hey, we can live with 30 more minutes of sleep. It turned into 9am without my knowledge, and me and Akcron tear off, we get out the door in less than 15 minutes, and when I get to work I setup my computer while reading the new deadlands book my best buddy gave me, and suddenly, I realized how hard it was to read. couldn't read a damn thing, eyes were blurry for a good 1 1/2 hours before clearing up.   So I've been reading up on deadlands, produced by Pinnacle, it's a pretty interesting tabletop roleplaying game, and I look forward to playing it, I'm going to probably make a couple of characters for the game to see what character I like.   Been in a writing mood lately, I wish I had access to my roleplaying master at work, I'd get more accomplished, but then again I really do need my D books to write effectively(as they provide the standard NPC's and major characters of DD) anyway, this weekend it'll be time to write more for my game, so look at my other blog  urlLink Nefarnomicon  for more information. Also been hungry to write my Website so I may start that task tonight or sometime real soon, going to add it to my Outlook Tasks.  more to come as I think of it.  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix
