I bought Target brand tampons last night... My momwon't go to the W store anymore b/c it's evil, so it's all Target and Shop-ko now.   Speaking of Target and shopping... My mom and I went on another shopping spree last night after we dropped my sister off. I don't know where this money is coming from... I  KNOW  that we don't have this money... My dad's gonna shit when he sees all the receipts... Oh well, it's school shopping and whatnot. Sorta... Anyway, the Dollar Store was having a 79 cent sale, so I got some cool socks and candles and shit. We spent $20 there... go us. Then we ate dinner at Panda Express. Muahahaha, I got my Orange Chicken!!!! After that we went to Target. Found some fun stuff at the $1 Spot (mini stapler/staple remover/tape set, magnets, mini highlighters) Saw Jason and Sami. Found out that they're moving into Gregg's old place, and Gregg's moving to Milwaukee. At least now I know where they live. Poor Sami, having to live w/ Jason. Muahahaha. Then I got some more clothes. A red shirt w/ Ralph on it picking his nose that says "Pick Me" ;) Plus, and here's where it gets good -- yes folks it's true,   I   gota skirt. *wiats for the shock to pass* Yes, a skirt. Green. For Homecoming and other random events for whichI feel like dressing up. B/c yes, I  do  do that every once in awhile. Infact, I'm in the mood to just dress up and wander around right now...Too bad I'm home alone and don't really feel like showering and callingto see who wants to do something. Maybe in a little while. After lunch or something. All because of yesterday's shopping excursion. Muahahahaha.Ohyeah, I got a hairbrush and chapstick too, but that's not very exciting, is it?  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm so hyper I really need to do something. Maybe I should go to Milton... but I need to go to the gas station first, b/c the pressure on my tires is really low... Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala *dances around* The internet gets really boring after awhile.. This isn't fair...
