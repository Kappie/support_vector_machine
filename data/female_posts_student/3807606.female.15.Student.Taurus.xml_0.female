Anyways, last weekend I went to the lake and Amanda came w/ me. It was fun. We played in the pool like we use to-our little goggles on. Hehe. Just like Amanda had in her post, I really feel like i'm still a kid at heart..yet part of me wants to grow up and part of me doesn't. Being a little kid was great because if you skinned your knee your mommy or daddy would always kiss it to make it better. But now, if you skin your knee you just brush it off. (That's kinda an analogy/example.) I'm looking forward to getting older though because there's so many more privilages. But the responsiblites are bad. *sigh* I guess everyone should just be thankful for what they have. Some people are dying as I write in this and there's nothing we can do about it. So if you just take day by day, God, friends, and family will help you get through every thing. 
     Monday I volunteered with Brad and we went to his grandparents house to play with his little cousins. One of his little cousins has a crush on me. (He's 6.) Yesterday was a nice day at the lake. I got to see my friend from Pennsylvannia, Leighton, again which was nice cause I missed her a lot. Brad came up w/ me and we went tubbing, jet skiing, and the best part..sitting in my brother's fishing boat watching the sunset. Even though we couldn't really see the sun setting, it was still nice. Brad said to me, "Some people would do anything to sit in a boat w/ their boyfriend/girlfriend and watch the sunset, and look, i'm with you right now doing this."; I replied, "I guess we're just both lucky." *sigh* I think i'm a romantic freak...ha Today I woke up around 11 AM and got some brunch and worked out. Then I did some laundry and emptied the dishwasher and made some brownies. I felt like a little stay-at-home-mom. Hehe. I enjoy working around the house because it feels good to help my parents out. 
     Well, that's my life...
