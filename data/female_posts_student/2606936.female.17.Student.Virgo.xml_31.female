(It used to be called festival but apparently all the stupidly non-musically-inclined teachers at school got pissed because they thought were were missing school to go to a party.....)  The requirement is that each band plays three pieces. One is a march, one is a piece with movements, and one is just.... a piece. The teachers pick these from a list.  We are playing a massively fabulous piece called "Of Sailors and Whales" By W. Francis McBeth. It's got five movements, and they are all scenes from Melville's  MOby Dick.  It is mucho fun-o.   One of the best parts, in my opinion anyway, is that the third movement is almost all choral. Tubas, percussion, and low reeds play, and everyone else sings. It's some of the words from the ballad "Father Mapple's Hymn" and it's a tune that's similar to "Eternal Father, Strong to Save," which adds up to a mournful song baout a guy stuck in a whale praying.  However, I love to sing. LOOOOVE to sing. I may not be so good but I enjoy it. I did a little theater and a lot of band and I can belt it o-u-t when needed.  SO, we're going over it today in class with CT's dad, who's a chorus dude, and every time the "women" had to sing, CT would be like, "GO AUDREY!" and people kept smiling at me and stuff. I thought the sopranos were just really soft (i'm singing alto) compared to the guys, but when we got out of class, I was informed that I'm the only girl who can actually be heard. Apparently I sound pretty good, since there was no malice or anything. i actually got asked if I'd had training!   So there's a nice feather for my metaphorical AP Lang/Lit Hat. As one guy put it ,  I am "the only girl who has gonads."
