Grainger is the rockin'est weird genius musician ever, and this song ROCKETH. (Horn dominance, anyone?)  I might could attempt to post the recording of the piece HERE, but i tend to hate that, altho that usually results from crappy midi files..... i'll look into something that doesn't violate copyrights.  AND if you've ever taken Zoloft, or know someone who has, and had odd moody side effects from it OF ANY SORT, or you just happen to know a whole lot about it, please leave a comment with ur story..... i am trying to find out something and yeah, ease my nerves here.
