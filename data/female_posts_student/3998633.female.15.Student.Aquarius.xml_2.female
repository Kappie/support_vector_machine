I do notknow how my friends do it, I mean not only do they update at least twice a week, but they manage to write almost a paragraph each time. Maybe they have a lot going on with their life, butbut to methat is devotion.   I love current events, so there will be a lot of news on this blog among other things, but just like any newssource it will be biased, but it will only be biased if you a a conservative nut, in which case you should slowy step away from the computer and punish yourself for thinking closed-minded people knew how to use "computers" (the "" are there because Mac's are not really computers, they are large pieces of hard candy).   I will update in the next month, if I do not forget, until then an insightful thought: Love burns like laser death rays of love.
