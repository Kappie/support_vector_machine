I dont think about it as much as i ever did, nor do i feel that i have to, or have to like him. The feeling of not starting to to like him is starting to increase. So i guess what im saying, is that im starting not to like him, alot. Which is good. Im sure he will be happy to hear so. Im going to bed. Goodnight
