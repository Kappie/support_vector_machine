He took us for lunch today to Yo China.  Firstly his bro is awesome (cool attitude). Anyhow we had Agzez Bloodfist (Nisheeth Sharma for the uninitiated)with us who 's a hogger. So we ended up emptying Apoorvi's pockets. I think the most shocking thing for Sinha was that he realised that i had table manners (which I usually do not showcase as most of the times we eat at fast food joints) One person who certainly didn't have them was SS (figure it out on ur own), who managed to get noodles on her hair.) Also this was a lifetime opportunity for Apoorvi as he had SS all to himself for once.(though Sinha also wanted some attention!!) NO OFFENCES MEANT. But anyhow we ended up in Barista and I ended up playing Chess with Rahul ( a friend of Apoorv's) whom i defeated in the 15 min play, though some would beg to differ. I think this is enough for the first posting.  Guys u can write ur comments too. P.S. Am dreading tommorrow (have our class assembly and will be getting Chem papers)
