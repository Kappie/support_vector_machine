I really enjoyed it, even if it was a full 128 minutes long (plus the 20 or so previews our theater insists on showing - 5 previews: good; 8-10 + commercials: just too many).  I just discovered that this story was loosely based on a real person!  Some guy has been living in the Charles de Gualle airport in Paris since 1988.  I was 10 in 1988.  Don't believe me?  I'm not quite sure if I do... but check it out  urlLink here.   Ah...I fear my internet may be about to crash on me...  And I have dinner coming up, so alas, I must depart.  I'm going on a cruise in August!  Yippeeeee!
