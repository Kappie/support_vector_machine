I got up and watched some of the Rumsfeld hearings, which were enlightening and disheartening at the same time. I was glad to hear that old bastard Rumsfeld give an unequivocal apology, and I also enjoyed watching McCain and Kennedy scold him for being unclear and secretive. While I was zoning out into deep political reverie, Lisa came back from her final way too early. Apparently she upchucked in the middle of the exam, and they sent her home. Hmm. After she went to bed, I went to class, only to discover class was cancelled. That happens so rarely at the UC that I was somewhat disbelieving. But I can't complain. I went home and watched some more of the Rumsfeld hearings, and mailed a letter (and I think our neighbors are all bastards. I smile at them, and they just look at me like I'm nuts. Shiteaters with screaming kids and nasty garbage on their step. And they leave their shoes all around the front door. I'm quelching an urge to steal a pair and put them in the trash heap across the parking lot.), attempting to scowl at the neighbors who I hate. Okay, so I'm dealing with a lot of rage today, and I have for the past few days. I think I need some alone time. I might make a drive out to Vacaville and shop or something. I'm just tired of being home and not getting stuff done. I think it's that I make myself a little crazy when there are other people around. I'm just feeling sorry for myself. I need to finish a reading and tidy the house before Jerm and Trina get here tonight.
