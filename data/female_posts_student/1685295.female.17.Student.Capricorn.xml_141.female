If you guys would get that whole don't move/breathe thing down, I'm sure he'd love you.  And I didn't *say* it, so it doesn't count. ^_^  Caramal Apple lattes very good . . .and make Dead's hands tasty.  Fatalistic is the new video game - chop, kill kick, kiss.  This makes sense, no?  And I hate that teacher. . .still, and a lot.  He's an invasion of my privacy! . . .I don't think that was what I meant.    Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat, Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best, Only the lull I like, the hum of your valv√®d voice.  -Walt Whitman, Song of Myself
