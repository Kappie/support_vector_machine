Never ever! the truth hit me hard...i noe it...and yet i still let myself get hurt...hu on earth wud b stupid-er den me? On my way home from hospital...i thought of 1001 ways of how to commit suicide...hmmz...dunnoe why... i'm in agony...can neone soothe my ache? i have no mood to study for my exams...much less do my english corrrections...wat shld i do? can God gif me a sign or wat? There is no colours in my life...everything is in plain black and white...mayb dat is a gd thing...or mayb it isnt. Everyone on this planet is an empty shell...a lifeless corpse dat can walks...a machine dat can toks...wat are we created for? where are my goals? where have they gone? I can't imagine myself all ALONE without her...will i still b able to carry on living? Of course i can. No matter how difficult it is...life gets on...be it whether u r in agony...or in cloud nine...life will get going...throwing all my thoughts a millisecond ago into e past. EVERYTHING is the past...there is no such thing present as it onli means a millisecond. Its either past or future...how much 'future' we haf is all predestined in our past...there's absolutely nothing dat can be done to prolong it...in other words, we are jus 'cutting' away our future n 'pasting' it on our past. The total 'area' remains unchanged. Can someone help me? Tears are streaming down in my heart... Mankind are complicated beings...and so it is.
