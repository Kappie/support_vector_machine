But she's 18, and even if she wasn't, her parents won't let us do anything that might make her mad.  My Uncle Dennis (not her dad) literally tried to kidnap her once, but even that didn't work.  Don't think we haven't tried.  We have.  We've done everything in our power.  That's why she was here.  We didn't exactly want her here, but she was welcomed with open arms because we thought it might help.  We've literally gone from one extreme to the other and back, from taking a firm stand against her seeing him and all that, to completely not caring, hoping that it was a control issue, and we've tried taking middle ground.  None of it has worked.  She's back with Blake and she didn't even want to be, really.  She just wanted to go home before she went to Tisa's.  And now she may never come back.
