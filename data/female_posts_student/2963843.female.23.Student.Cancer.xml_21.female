I seem to be staring more at the books than I study.. Eeek! Nothing seems to make sense...  Am I getting old? My memory is failing me...  God I hate theories..  What is the point? You try to cram everything into your brain, vomit them out for exams then whooosh! They are out of your life forever....  Theories are only the 'feeder bus' passengers of your brain! What is the point I ask? I hope, I pine, I relish the day when there are no more wasteful management theories that devours our youth away.. Argh...  Forgive me everybody,  Its the exams!
