I still have to write a toast, which I have to idea how to do. that should turn out interesting. me  mom are going up to jen's this weekend for fittings for my dress. I don't really want to have to stand for half an hour to get people poking around the dress, but I will get to see my neices, and I haven't seen them for awhile, so that should be fun. on sunday I'm leaving for C.I.A. (Catholics in Action). I'll be doing some service projects with another town since we couldn't get anybody from here to go. I'll get back on tuesday night.  I really should practice my clarinet...I haven't played it since school got out, and blair will be on my back once school starts, probably to audition for all-state. damn, I need to get some dress clothes for audition rounds. I totally forgot. maybe we'll go shopping tomorrow.
