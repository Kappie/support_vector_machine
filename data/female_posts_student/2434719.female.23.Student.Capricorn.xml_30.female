The game is like truth or dare, but only with questions of truth and no dares. We ask questions like, where do you see yourself in ten years, how much money do i have to pay you to sleep with me, etc etc etc :).  well one of the questions was, "what is one thing you would change about yourself?" the first person to answer was female, and she said something about her body... and that started the trend of answering the question with physical traits.   and i got to thinking... how come nobody answered with traits that would make them a better person, not just a better mold of society's beautiful.  even i fell victim, saying if i had to change anything it would be my hairy arms. :) but, there are hundreds of other things i wish were different. i wish i were more patient sometimes, i wish i were more self-motivated, organized, disciplined, giving, and a whole other laundry list of virtues.... but, i do work on those things every day. if we don't try to work on our faults, our ways of life that aren't making the world a better place, what's the point of being here? there has to be a purpose to life and i truely don't beleive it's to honk at that guy who cut in front of me, or to shut everyone out while i stay too focused on school to realize what's going on in the rest of the world.  the way i figure, hairy arms aint' so bad. :)
