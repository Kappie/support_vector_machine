I still want to think of an idea before actually learning though...I was thinking something along the lines of TFS Survivor.  Each episode will feature a different teacher as an "obstacle".  Or maybe that's not a funny idea?  I'd like to do something really funny and random... Ooooh!  I know! Heheheh....
