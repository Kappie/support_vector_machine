I missed him so much. :P I loooove you Trey.   I went over to his house on...Sunday. Maryann, Kelsey, and Ian came over too. Maryann is too cool. She made me a princess hat (with security tabs!) and gave me some sunglasses. She had pocky too. =0 That girl has cool running through her blood.   Trey came over yesterday. We didn't do much. I'm boring. =(  He was supposed to come over today too. But my dad wouldn't let me do anything. What bullshit.   He's coming over tomorrow though. YAY. I can't see why'd he want to. >_   Yeah. That's it.
