Like, same theme as Bicentenial Man and A.I. but with more action. Will Smith was really good...for any female readers, take your boyfriend or whatever and let him enjoy the action while you drool shamelessly over Will's nude body in the first scene. It was a pretty good movie nonetheless, and the storyline was pretty decent and logical and interesting. We (my Dad and I) drove through Kilmore on our way to the movies 'cause I had to drop of my resume in the newsagents -crosses fingers- and we decided to ask the twins whether they wanted to come too. He, half an hour later they drag their sleepy selves from their house and we were off. I had to do some shopping too, so it was pretty fun dragging those two round the plaza whilst my dad went to look for a scanner or something like that. Anyway, that night we went to my aunt's for my uncle's birthday dinner rugby match do, and I met the most fuckwitted guy in my life. His name was like Huey, or something and his wife and daughter were lovely but this guy was off his head. I came into the lounge where they were watching the Wallaby-Springbuck match and happened to stand in something wet. Naturally I'm all like "eaugh, what is this?" and he tells me it's wine that his wife spilt and he stepped into it to, and brandishes his own wet sock. I wonder aloud whether or not I should wipe it up, and he tells me no, don't bring attention to it...remember etiquette? Anyway, I gave him a weird look, cause who does this stranger think he is giving me a lecture in mannars and tell him that I was merely wondering whether it was water or something else. He smiles and tells me wine is mostly water with a little alcohol...(like he can talk)...and I just give him a look that plainly says...you dickhead, who the hell are you?  Anyway, there was a bit of a blue about the fire going out so I got up to see what I could do to fix it. The same fuckhead comes over and says "You're a good girl, a pacifist..." and I'm all like yeah whatever. Then he tries to help by trying to set a tissue alight. I kid you not...a single tissue. When he failed miserably, I went to look for firelighters. By the time I came back without firelighters, Huey was standing there a little lost. I pointlessly blew on the single tissue, and the whole thing burst into flame before Huey excitedly (and without a doubt, drunkedly) placed a large log on it. For all those who are not pyromaniacs or farmers, doing this is completely useless because the log will merely smother the small flame. I pointed out several times that we'd either need to find kindling or other suitable fuel, but to no avail. Eventually Bruce came with the box of firelighters, and let Huey do the honours of lighting them, an action that surely has a prerequirement of years of training, and I left the boys to bask in the glory of creating fire. Later, Bruce brings Huey back to the rest of the people, who is greated with uproarous cheering. Typical.  Oh, and today I have had the absolute pleasure of meeting two ex-boyfriends as well as someone I got with in the span of about 15 minutes. Jess, I think I'm spending too much time with you!!
