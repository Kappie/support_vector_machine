Oh well, I am good now.   Today, I do not even remember waking up really.   Nevermind, got it. My dad yelled for me to come to breakfast. That is a decent thing to wake up to. "Home-cooked food, something that you learn a fine appreciation for in the FIRST robotics program" - Jonathan D. Fournier circa 2000. How true.  Too bad last night I ate a lot lol. Do not give me that look. I'm serious. Ate Andy Capp's Hot Fries (a lot of them) with Sobe green tea at the rest stop, chicken/spinach salad from Wendy's, baked potato from Wendy's, and then two chocolate chip cookies at the bowling alley. I wanted starchy things for whatever reason. It was bizzare, and I kept mocking it.   But anyways, back on track, kids.   I want to walk that huge hill again...odd.  Two graduation parties today which I nearly somehow forgot about. Wrote up shell cards for both James and Marie. Yes, a shell card for James...muhuhahaha.  Walked to Marie's house, not trusting myself with her gift. She will get it eventually. For those who do not know, it was a birthday/graduation party. Now spiffy is that? Got there and chilled with her and her friend Jennifer from Enfield. Played a bit of soccer before Marie opened gifts and then I had to run over to James. His friend Jill gave him a DVD. A wonderful DVD I might add. Monty Python and the Holy Grail I might add. Beautious. We watched that and go figure everyone there knew it all lol. We want to make a broadway version...so be prepared for that. James noted my lack of hyperness-i-tude, buddy. Poo, I was still tired, and am a bit depressed from missing someone. Hell, James never met the kid and he said something along the lines of Tycho being the best for me. Thank you for that James. Remember, Tuesday...it is you, Monika, myself, and Eric the Viking lol. You need to tell me what food to have. I already know that I need root beer for you. I will give you more details such as timeage later.   So today was decent, I enjoyed it anyways.   I need to go to WalMart and get my glasses fixed. This whole "falling off of my face" thing is really ticking me off. Arg.   Anyways, more of what I did not stay awake for last night. I mostly just wanted to include more details and more of how I felt I suppose. If you are uninterested you may stop reading here. Yes, that means you, the reader, who is reading this.   I thought that I was so sure of myself and what I had planned to do the instant that I saw Matt. Whoops, how wrong of me.   I froze.  It felt like everything in my freaking body condensed and I could not have been more happy. I guess it was a good thing that I did not run to him, because his rents probably would have liked to injure me. Actually we did not even go near each other for a few minutes. I wanted to, but I was not sure if he wanted me to. So we all sat there. Tossed the frisbee a bit and talked - but mainly just sat there. We moved to go and play frisbee 'n such. Finally got a hug though.   Back at bench, pool. Finally got what I had wanted next to the hug there. I felt awkward because of Shawn, but I warned him...and I should not have refrained from what I really wanted. That was the largest test of self control  ever .   Eh, I will skip some. Back to the bench lol.  The  bench. I want to go and steal that bench lol. Just being on that bench has brought me so much. It was there that I sat the times at Frontiers when Matt was the only person to give me the time of day, and no, for you information, no I did not ever tell him to do the proverbial "piss off". That bench...yay. lol :-D ;-)  I have to eat, so posting is...er...postponed.  Please enjoy this commercial break/intermission.  La  Ti   Da  - Gonna be a while? Grab a snickers! - C'mon down to Bob's Discount Funiture! - JC Penny's One Day Only Sale, where everything is 10, 20  30 % off! - Wendy's: Eat great, even late! Introducing the new Wendy's late-night pick-up window, open until 1 AM or later! - Make 7-Up Yours!  Okay, okay. I'm done with that. The sad thing is - I really do not watch TV. Movies - yes, TV - no. Eh, some of those are pretty old though, from when I did, in fact, watch a bit of television.   Back to Battlecry...or rather...what I did instead of Battlecry...  Skipping...skipping...skipping...skipping...ah, okay. Near the wedge. Matt was kinda cold outside, and cars were being weird. Honestly, why would you watch a couple of kids ... er ... sitting on a bench? Anyways, we moved inside and chilled near some lockers. Besides the guy charging back and forth with the umbrella (which he sometimes opened!  ::insert exaggerated gasp here:: . That was actually pretty funny. I enjoyed it anyways.   That was where we missed the reservation at Sole P. because we were a bit um...preoccupied? Er...we were not hungry! Honestly! Then when we were hungry at like...what was it? 11:30pm? We decided to walk to that Eddie's place...where I think Tych got irritated because I was not going to eat...so I did eat. I was glad that I did, because I was pretty hungry and it helped with the energy part of things. Walked back to Claudio's ... rather quickly because it had gotten a bit more chilly and we were figuring on having to let Claudio in at midnight I believe it was. Got back there, I think his name was John was just leaving. He got some pizza. Well, waited for Claudio...he got back and then left for a party for a few again. Came back again, chilled for a few...slept.  Tych and I...really did not do much sleeping. We sort of made up for lost time until it was very bright outside... then  we went to sleep. That was awesome. I got to figure out a few things he liked n'such.   He, however, figured something out also...and I do not know if he did realize the extent to which what he figured out worked. I imagine that he did since he seemed to comment on it most of the time lol. Well, what can I say? Damn, I can feel myself turning red just writing this.  I think I could have potentially injured blood vessels in my face from blushing so much, especially since Tych figured out pinkching my cheeks and touching my nose makes me instantly "glow". Then telling me that I am red just makes it that much worse lol. It was pretty funny actually.  But yeah, I sort of said things then that I feel pretty silly for. Getting caught up in the moment, you sort of think for the moment, and then when you calm down later realize that you said things that you probably would not have said under other circumstances. That does not mean that I did not mean what I said really, I just cannot believe that I did say them, and I do not know how they were looked upon by the receiving end. Tough situation.  I am glad of how the night turned out though. Being able to sleep next to the person that means the most to you is the best feeling ever. Especially when you were not sure if you would be able to or not and then it works out in your favor :-D  Waking up was tough too, because I did not want to leave because that seems like it would speed time up and we would not be able to be together as much for as long if we did leave. We had to, sorrowfully. I caught up on the competition a bit and saw Brittany. It was nice to see her, and lucky for me she agrees with my being with Tycho and he thinks that she is a cool person. That is a step up from the days of old in itself too.   I could not help but think back to Frontiers a lot of the time there. I grew up since then. I can feel it. I thought of sitting on that bench hoping that someone would come and talk to me...like I used to do before I became as social as I am. I remember kicking myself in the ass because that was not how I wanted to act. I wanted to be known as a very social person, and that was not the way to do it. I was supposed to go find people, get along with them, and have a great time. Once robotics came around I did more of that. Other than my team in that competition, I really just did not mix well with the other students there. The PAs yeah, they were great, and I talk to them more than any of the residents next to Brandon. I seem to actually do that a lot too. I guess I am just more used to people that are older than me. Mostly what I thought of though, was again being on that bench waiting for someone to talk to me. Matt usually asked if I was okay, and if I was sure. I would just say that I was, because I basically was. I just reacted very poorly. I know if I were there now I most certainly would not have done the same things. I would be the way I would have liked to if I was. When no one did talk to me it was the dismay and depression that set in. I felt that I was unaccepted there, and that just seemed to confirm it. I was very self-conscious and almost self loathing. I was amazed that I did not cut myself when I was there. I just wanted to sit alone, and be alone until the end of the trip. I opened up to my team and Lisa by the end and became more myself. I was a bit fake about it, but I still got better. I would not eat around anyone, but I would sit in the room and listen to conversations. I sat with Kristen a few times. Sat with Kat's group a few times. Matt(not Tych) and Frank usually tried to help me.  I see that now, there were people I got along with and did not mind me being with them. Mike, Eric, Frank, Matt (again not Tych), Brandon, Lisa, sort of that group.   I cannot say I did nothing there. I set myself in here and there.  Crud helped. A lot. I even talked a bit to Tycho there, even though I was pretty sure he did not want me to. I still hate the fact that I did not hang out with him and his residents when I skipped out on the mall.  That bench though. That was where I got the most attention from Tycho, who I actually had a crush on during the program lol. A few people found out about that and were highly amused. They did not think I liked anyone there, nevermind having had a crush lol. They tried( maybe succeeded) numerous times to tell him about it too. I cannot say that I minded all that much because it was true. I ended up telling him online afterwards.  On the bench this year at Battlecry though, I was on that bench. Instead of thinking about how I had a crush on Tycho, he was there with me.   I was, and still am amazed.   Frontiers worked out for me. Every bit. Took a while, but it did. I have regrets, but yet, I do not. Everything happens for a reason.   I have rambled for quite some time now. I wonder how boring it was. That was basically everything that ran through my mind, unabridged. I am just amazed. I am with the person that I really wanted to be with since last July. Wow. I do not know what else to say, just wow. It is the most awesome thing and the most awesome feeling ever.  I will stop now lol, sorry y'all. We are free, so let me know if you want to do something even though I will probably contact y'all. My room is getting done so there is plenty of room to chill and sleep. Take care and have a good one!  -J9
