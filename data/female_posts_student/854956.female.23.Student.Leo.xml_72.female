Haloscan is doing server work... some of the comments are gone for now, but will return once they're done... don't fret, just help me look out for them... because if they don't come back on here, I'll have to notify Haloscan so they can find them and fix the problem.    And Now...    I'm going to start stuff in my room... Ricky thinks I'm going to be depressed... but I'm not!  This blue is a HAPPY blue!  :-)  Anyhow, my Dad and I patched the major cracks last night, so today I get to patch all the push pin and nail holes in the walls.  Oh, what fun!  :-\  And then I get to start painting today... WAHOO!!!
