I haven't written anything in a while.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Swirling lyrics Reminding me of Everything I’m missing  Don’t think I’d mind Too much if it was You I could be kissing  How lovely you’ll always Seem to me when Your eyes pour into mine  Always I feel As if I’ll never Escape this twirling vine  -3/28/03  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Sometimes it's okay Sometimes it's just fine Most times it's controversial If you ever cross the line   Sometimes it's not reality Seldom is it true Just hold me once and I'll recall A lifetime forth with you  -12/12/02  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  i'm empty inside...  i wish i could tell you how much you mean to me  my eyes are dry from crying  and you don't even know the only thing i fear is that you won't ever know the thorns outnumber everything and i  can't see the sky anymore...  "you're so very special i wish i was special"  just tell me what to do because you're all that i could ever want  4/26/03  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Then my hindered sight goes black Revealing all the things I lack The heart inside my chest gone cold Destroying that which once was bold All I thought I knew is dead I must have missed some thing you said Or maybe what I thought I heard The sound of lovely silent word Believing what you did not say Everything I hold at bay Salty tears in my eyes brew Gently falling drops of dew Marvel at the state of life Ignore the numbing sense of strife Enduring pain, I clench my fist And banish myself to the mist…  -Murder of a Feeling I don't remember when I wrote that  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
