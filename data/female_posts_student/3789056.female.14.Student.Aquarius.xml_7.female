Oh, bloody hell shit man. How am I gone to overcome this?   well, I dunno wat to do and rite now I need someone to guide me, but the problem is who?????   I felt that I am getting isolated from this world these few day, I don't feel like talking to anybody or go out with anybody. I just want to be alone. But I think this would only make the situation more worse than ever before(okay I am just exxagerating...).    Hmmm..... I was wondering if I could chat with a complete stranger whom none of my friends know... well like people in other countries except Singapore.    life is getting more and more boring.   what am I going to do now to salvage the journey ahead of me....   I'm going to have a serious headache if this kind of nonsense continues inside me, myself.. I can't concentrate in whatever things I do and I know that this kind of lifestyle wouldn't make me through...   I have a strong feeling inside me that motivates me to change for a better me, however, I am already strengthless. I have no will power to carry me through, and I am now too weak to make any decisions of my own.   My determination has been shattered ever since I begun to realise the I had been such a nuisance and was always making a fool of myself. I tried to cheer people up but in the end I get only glances of disapproval. What am I to do when the whole world had made me a sinner?--Time shall reveal the answer... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...... ... ...
