It would mean that every one had the same amount of things, the same chances and shared every thing. Do you want this? Instead would you have every thing for yourself and nothing for no one else? I think I would prefere every one to have the same chances in life, with the same amount of money than me being greedy and having it all. If we spread out the world's food supply, then there would be more than enough. Instead we consume more than neaded, and throw away food that could feed starving children. Is this right?
