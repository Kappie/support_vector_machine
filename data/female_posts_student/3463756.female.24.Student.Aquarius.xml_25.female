Me, I didn't think Io. i believe that  guy was attracted to my boyfriend, but so what, he comes home with me anyway. I would think I would be worried if he decided to go with the guy instead but since that didn't happen, I figure there is no need for worry.  Christopher street was a bit of a revelation. I expected a lot of gay people, but I guess I didn't expect it to be so in your face. I don't know why not, I guess maybe it was just a mistake on my part. K was a little shocked I think, he wanted to hold on to me tight, but they tried to pick him up anyway. Ha ha. Fetish stores, cheesy t-shirt stores, bars and tattoo stores all jostle for place. Enter a bar and what do you see? A man dancing on stage, cleverly concealing his you know what, and yet the audience holds its breath hoping that somewhere somehow he will drop the towel(or whatever he is using for concealment) and they will all get to view. The dancer was good though and I had a good time.  Its a humbling experience for a straight girl to go into a gay bar. You get the feeling you aren't worth much. You could walk in naked and noone would care much except perhaps some nice guy would ask whether you were cold. For the most part though you feel like you might just be a part of the furniture. On the other hand, its the safest place to be if you want to just walk in, have a drink and sit and watch the nice eye candy around you without the resident creep coming over and chatting you up. No need to wonder if you are dressed appropriately or anything. No snide bitches to pass remarks on your dress sense either. It's an experience.. One I don't regret having.  Fourth of July. Independence day. Looking back at other independence days back in India I remember quite a few. In my school days I remember having to go to school, marching and preparing for flag hoisting, in my college days, it became another holiday, one on which dad was home too. But here its an altogether different feeling. Maybe it was cog we went to NYC for the day. First the Bronx zoo. We didn't get to see it all but we did have fun. Tiring but fun.  but the fireworks display was the best. Its a different thing than what we experience it back in India. You just sit back and enjoy the show, previous experience for me at least shows how it can be just as fun to be more active in the setting off of the fireworks than simply be passive and enjoy the display. I cant decide which I like better. One thing that remains the same is definitely the smell afterwards. That brings a lot of fond memories back. Waking up, dial day, taking the traditional "oil bath" and always being late for going down and setting off a token firework. That was then and this is now and I just have to settle for the way things are now. And I point out, they ant too bad at all.
