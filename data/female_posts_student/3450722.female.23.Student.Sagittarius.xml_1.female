Since this class was taught by a democratic, tree-hugging hippie, we often had to watch some of his films and write papers on them. After seeing Bowling For Columbine, I was pissed about the way he portrayed owners of guns. I also thought him being a traitor to American when he went to Cananda to interview why they thought Americans were so violent. All I know is that he if he thinks America is so bad, why doesn't he go somewhere else to live? Maybe him and John Kerry can get together with the rest of Hollywood and promote French films in America... what do you think?I also think that he is just making himself look bad, since there have been so many discrepencies between what he calls "fact" and what really took place. He tries to make President Bush look stupid, when actually the only one who is looking stupid is him. I think it's awesome how Bush is being praised at being the "smart" one this time by handing over Iraq to their goverment early to fool the terrorists. Great Job W!
