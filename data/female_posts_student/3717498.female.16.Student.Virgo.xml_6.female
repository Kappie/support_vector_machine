u can't just sit there until something exciting happens....so basically we are suppose to get up and run around and make something exciting...like what tho?...ee i lived in the city for SSSSOOOO unberably long..and no doubt .. i love toronto...all those crazy cultures and street parties..but those can only last for so long..eventually u will get sick of chillin...i mean last week i went out 3 days in a row...to the mall and the next two to like downtown...i mean for the first two days, it was like WOW i am have so much much incredible fun but the 3rd was liek..dammit give me something new..i can't stand chilling for the rest of my life cuz i am sick of it already..man i wonder sometimes i am liek i want to become a doctor....but i dont' kno, theres liek an empty element to the whole profession. ok chances are u WILL get married but think of it this way...ur stuck in teh hospital treating people which is fun and rewarding for liek 14 hours a day..then u go home to ur kids and hopefully the HOT husband..try to cook a meal with all the energy u have left and go to sleep..wake up the next morning (or before the pager from the hospital gets u) and same shit all over..i can't stand that..i need something, something more i would say..liek saving lives is ABSOLUTELY cool and making all that difference in someone's life physically and hopefully mentally is even better but like the whole routine sounds so repetitive..medicine itself is not repetitive but the whole concept of it is..liek it is probably going to be a HUGE emotional roller coaster which makes life challenging but the whoel make money to feed ur kids thing is VERY VERY repetitive and i absoutely HATE repition..argh....well liek any job liek htat is today..most peopel just need to feed their kids and some poeple enjoy what they do... its like the feeling i always feel..of always wanting MORE..i can have the best time in the world but i go home i feel the same old way empty and grasping for more..i mean dont' get me wrong for the time being while i am caught in the moment i am having fun...but i dont' completely enjoy it..cuz i want MORE.....so waht is MORE i ask myself..liek i hope MORE for me is like living in abandonement outside the rules of society....i kno i like to travel but not for the rest of my life....hmm what do i want?..nothing seems liek it can fill up the weird MORE feeling..like friends i have and they make me laugh although i wish sometimes i had different friends..more like people who know how to have innocent fun rather then smoking it up and gettin high and doing all these weird illegal things....ahah it would be cool to be a secret agent of some kind..u kno liek the ones with guns and hi-tech gadgets and run around to get like secret information of some kind..aaahh u get the drift....i have a family and all though i dont' have a sister and we are a bit financially retarded..i am just fine with them..sometimes but meh....i dont' kno..like i have everything that some people would want...but i still want more..i don't kno..i can't get enough of anything...i figure now that i look at it..throughout my life..i was never truly happy...like i never have felt true happiness and everyone can come around me and tell me ooh ur so lucky man u are probably the happiest person alive that i know...am not....i may LOOK happy...but lots of stuff goes on inside..my quest for true happiness...i am trying to think of an event that has made me the happiest for a while...hmm going back to RI in May was wicked..i got off the car and everyone was like AHHH UR BACK !! and it was great to see everyoen again..i had the biggest grin on my face that day...such a great time..thousands of miles away from everyoen and thing that could cause me happiness and at the same time sorrow....is this feeling  a result of :   a) being an underappreciative brat b) taking everything for granted c) a gift from GOD?  for so long i wanted this weird I want more feeling to be a gift from God..almost liek a vocation..i want it in a weird weird way..but at the same time i am scared and confused about what it really can be...i mean for a while i thought it was a gift....like rey he starts to feel liek empty but hez happy when he finds a love interest...liek everyone else..but for me its different..i have felt it all my life...as long as i can remember....i never had a true feeling of satisfaction...could it be...love? i don't think so..i reall dont' feel any romantic interest for so far....i haven't mr mr..haven't really been attracted to anybody for a long period of time enough to want...ok well i have...but like deep down i kno i don't want one.but at the same time i do..jsut to see how it would change me...like to fall in love..but i dont' think it is possible to fall in love at this age....meh..sighz..someone i need to be inspired   complex noises and high pitched buzzes constantly fill my ear these are the sources of joy but also, great sorrow my exterior may show a very strong iron layer of exuberence but really, it is just a mask,  to cover up the pain that i don't even know why i feel the layer is really just a thin cheap porcelain  and if you look carefully into it you will feel the romance of my emptiness  [just can't get enough]
