But nothing's there! Eeeep! And then before I saw a head out of the corner of my eye looking into my room from the door way. And I thought I was my brother so I said "Shut up, Cole." Like I always do, and I almost think I heard laughter. And then when I looked down the hall, no one was there!! Jesus I'm so paranoid right now *rocks back and forth*... But in other news, Brendan just sent me them rejected cartoons by Don Hertzfledt. Bloody awesomeness! I saw it over @ Nikkis a while ago... and now I have it! Yay! *donces* I know there was other stuff I was thining about a while ago... Before I was poked in the stomach by something non-existant that is! Ha! Oh yea, well this afternoon I was talking w/ Brendan (for the first time since his Film Camp yay!) and we got onto the subject (well I just randomly brought it up is more like it) of why hot guys are gay. And I said that if Johnny Depp went gay that I would be gravely disappointed, even tho I don't stand a chance with him now. I guess we can only hope that he's a pedo, or else I might have to hunt him down and rape him and make him my sex slave.. Bwahahaha!! Heeee, no more sugar for me ^________^ But anyways, Brendan suggested that if he was gay then I could get a sex change, but then there's the akwardness of suddenly having a penis and then the bumsex... Boy howdy! But honestly.. I'm kinda lossing faith in the straight male catagory thinger... They all seem like jerks. So maybe it'll be my only hope. Or I could some how get a  urlLink gay boyfriend . Either way... the majority of straight guys piss me off with their jerkish ways. But.. meh.. I'll just cuddle my plushies for now.. Not like that you bastards. *shakes fist* I need a Johnny Depp plushie... >_>
