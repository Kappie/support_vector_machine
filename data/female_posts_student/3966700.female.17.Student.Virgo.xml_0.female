I dont know why i been acting like this but to me its just come naturaly. Its not a good thing. Ne-ways I have no way to fix it, I dont know whats cusing it. And then something happened and Yahoo ... was gone i kicked my chair and fell on the floor crying. Over nothing it was just a thing. I need to get checked. I think I'm a fucking nut. They are going to send me to 45th Street. I am going to e locked up w/ my grandmother .. So i can even go more nuts, I truely need to get my shit striaght. But again I am to young to go fucking nuts. I am just 17 years old shouldn't this be happening whenI am like 45? I dont know but ... Its nuts like Iam nuts! I truely just need to blow some hot air and everything will me ok!. I hope I pray! ... I think I will be fine!... :D
