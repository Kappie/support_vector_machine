This shall probably be my final entry for some time now, so you'll have to excuse me if it turns out to be quite longwinded; I have a lot of things to say.  I feel like I want to look back and see if I can wrap up what I've been talking about here; I feel like its time to draw some conclusions.  So what have I learnt? I don't know. In reality, I think that this subject is a lot more complicated, indepth and ethereal than I had previously assumed. I had the misconception that there were easy answers out there to why some people are able to find love, and why others aren't, and that I just needed to start asking  the right questions. However, I've found that it turns out that there are no easy answers, in fact, I don't think there are any hard answers either. Maybe there's no answers at all, and all we can do is stick to generalisations, stabs-in-the-dark, and work out what it is that works for us, rather than by designing some foolproof system that can be cut-and-pasted over every life and every heart of every person.       Frankly, I though that I was just missing the tricks, that I wasn't paying attention. I had always had the impression that life moved along behind my back, and ever knew the rules, and the score, and I was condemned to be the water-boy forever. But, so far as writing this blog has taught me, we're all water-boys (or water-girls, or water-persons). There is no such thing as the most perfectly-adjusted individual, completely comfortable in themselves, confident, and able to find (and hold on to love) with the greatest of ease, never ever experiencing the pain of heartbreak; like a master trapeze artist soaring while the rest of us fall flat on our faces from a great height.  But it instead though, I don't know, maybe it's depressing, but I think it's a little exciting and empowering to know that we're all in the same boat here. Sure, some people are better at it than others (and I am definitely one of the others) but that doesn't mean they have any better idea of what the hell is going on than the rest of us do. Don't you think that's sort of a good thing? I mean, it's not like there are winners and losers, it's more like we're all going around discovering stuff that works, getting hurt, and fumbling our way through love together.       In fact, even though I'm still completely dateless (for those of you who've just tuned in, I've never had a girlfriend), I still enjoy the silly games that people play with each other. Sure it can be frustrating, and sometimes a bit depressing, but I wouldn't give up the thrill of the chase for anything. There's nothing more exhilirating than the rush of adrenalin you get when you finally summon up the courage to talk to the girl you've had your eye for so long, and that great feeling as your legs begin to take you closer without you even thinking about it.  And even if it doesn't come to anything, who cares? If she has a boyfriend, or if she turns out to be the complete opposite of what you expected, you still have the rush don't you? Sure, it's not much when you think about what you might have experienced had things worked out, but still; what would you have had if you just sat there all night nursing a drink instead of getting up and talking to her? Nothing but stupid, silly, pining over a girl and guilt. Trust me, that aspect of love I'm an expert on.  So I guess that's the best thing that I'll take from this. It's the realisation that while you need to know the rules, the codes, the tactics of the game; these will all come to nothing if you don't get out and actually  play the game . You have to get out there, learn, get hurt if you actually want to experience the upside to life, love and all the rest.  Finally, I'll apologise for the generally cliche-driven, introverted drivel that I have written throughout this blog; please forgive me, I know not what I do.  PS, hope you like the pictures I've put up, and the new colour scheme.  Actually, one last final word before I go; how come nobody has realised that the title for my blog is actually a pun (or a play on words)? When I came up with it, I thought it was really obvious. Think about it.  Buh-bye.  Please go home.
