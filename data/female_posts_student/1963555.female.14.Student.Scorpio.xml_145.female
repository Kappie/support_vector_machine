Jake Gyllenhaal is soooooooooooooooo hot! I saw Moonlight Mile yesturday, He is so awesome. I remember I first saw him in Bubble Boy, and then I fell in love with him, next I rented Donnie Darko, weird but hot, and so on.  Like I wanna ask some one out and, I'm feeling very assertive, but I was thinking about it, I don't think I'm really obsessed over anyone at the moment. Like I'm not gonna go after Chris, such a waist of years, and I like alot of guys at school (not that I sare this info with ANY friends) but I honestly don't think I like them enough to go that far. It's so frustraiting! But maybe that's what dating is, likeing someone a little, and going out and seeing if there is more, I think that's it. I don't know I'm so confused! So anyway next to the romance rut, I might be going to Florida this summer, and next summer I'm going for like 6 weeks! I'll still update here ofcourse. But my grandma wants me to volenteer at the hospital she volenteers at. I was born there so I guess that's cool. I could get a job down there too! Maybe if I'm lucky I'll meet someone. Well I guess I'll be going. Oh and like this year I've been doing things that I used to automatically say no to, like if there's a sleepover I wouldn't go because I didn't like the people there, I force myself to go and it's been really working for the better with me. Maybe I'll do this with my love life
