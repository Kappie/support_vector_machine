What should I be?  I'm thinkin like a princess or something, but thats always what I am.  I need suggestions.  Hum...Strawberry Shortcake?  That would be cool.  Perhaps Dorothy?  No, that's way too over done.  Maybe a chef?  Oh, wait, what's the point in dressing up?  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  I got it.  What about my Aunt Stephanie?  Then I could act like her, and make fun of myself and my party as much as I want.  But that would also mean not letting Josh play.  No, that won't work.  I think this calls for a trip to Joann's.  Or my costume box.  Or Performance.  Hummmm..shopping here I come!!  Well, yeh, I need advice also on what sorts of food items and games should be there.  For the people who care, I'm going to have a kinda "Blast from the Past" costume party.  Meaning foods and games that we played as little kids.  They are just going to be set up around the area, so that people can go over and start playing.  I already have a long list of stuff made by me and Josh, but we could go for some others.  Would you like the list?  Ok, here it is:   Food  Pigs "n" Blankets Puppy Chow The animal crackers things with the frosting stuff on top that are really good when you heat them up a little in the microwave Ants on a Log (Just for you, Josh) Gummy Bears Teddy Grahams (How do you spell that?) Kudos  String Cheese (That might be a little gross after sitting on the refreshment table with no refridgeration, but I'll work something out) Ritz Bitz (both cheese and peanut butter) Toasty Crackers And any others that you guys might think of... Plus the birthday cakes that I am going to make no matter what you say, Josh   Games  Finger painting Blopens Hula Hoops Various Bored Games Hopscotch Jump rope Skip it Any other suggestions??  Well, have fun practicing and tell me how it goes.  I'm sure it'll be interesting. Meanwhile, I get to sit here at home playing the piano because there is nothing else to do in this stupid house.
