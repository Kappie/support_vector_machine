Cats are independent, they don't listen, they don't come in when you call, they like to stay out all night, and when they're home they like to be left alone and sleep. In other words, every quality that women hate in a man, they love in a cat."-Jay Leno  "I'll probably stay lucky if my tounge will stay tied so I won't betray the things that I hide. There's not enough years underneath this belt for me to admit the way that I felt."-Seven Mary Three  "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist when he grows up."-Pablo Picasso  "True love is always shattered by reality."  "The young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat."-William Faulkner  "Love is not something you're able to feel when you reach a certain age, it's something that's always inside of you. It just depends on when you find a person who can bring that out in you."  “Calling it a simple schoolgirl crush was like saying a Rolls Royce was a vehicle with four wheels, something like a hay wagon. She did not giggle wildly and blush when she saw him, nor did she chalk his name on trees or write it on the walls of the kissing bridge. She simply lived with his face in her heart all of  the time, a kind of sweet, hurtful ache. She would have died for him.” –unknown  “Love is sweet misery.” –Aerosmith  “There is one pain I often feel, which you’ll never know.

With $10,000...we'd be millionaires!! We could buy all kinds of useful things we love."-Homer Simpson  "How long can a girl be tortured by you? How long before my dignity is reclaimed? And how long can a girl be haunted by you. Soon, I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name."-Alanis Morrissette "Flinch"  "You only live twice or so it seems,/ One life for yourself and one for your dreams./ You drift through the years and life seems tame,/ Till one dream appears and love is its name./ And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,/ Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone./ This dream is for you, so pay the price./ Make one dream come true, you only live twice." -Coldplay, "You Only Live Twice"  “Think of me as someone who is very often thinking of you.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “Keep smiling! (but not so much that people begin to wonder if you are mentally unbalanced).” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “There's only one thing more beautiful than a beautiful dream, and that's a beautiful reality.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “If you can't say exactly how much you love me, try to make a rough estimate.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “Somehow, in my busy life, I am finding time to miss you.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “I don't wish to appear overly inquisitive, but are you still alive?” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “It would be nice to see you again - and again.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “Regardless of the date, I’m glad you were born.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “If you can't keep in sight, at least keep in touch.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “Writing is the only thing that… when I’m doing it, I don’t feel like I should be doing something else.” –Gloria Steinern  “ ‘Fool,’ said my muse to me, ‘Look in they heart and write.’” –Sir Philip Sidney  “Did you ever consider that God puts longings in our hearts in order that we execute them?” –Sophy Burnham  “If a story is in you, it has got to come out.” –William Faulkner  “I love that you get cold when it’s seventy-one degrees out, I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich, I love that you get a little crinkle above your noes when you’re looking at me like I’m nuts, I love that after I spend a day with you I can still smell your perfume on my clothes and I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it’s not because I’m lonely, and it’s not because it’s New Year’s Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.” –From the movie “When Harry Met Sally”  “At a glance, I love you with a thousand hearts.”  “After you’ve been to college for a while, you start to expect yourself to dislike a poem for certain stock specific reasons, because whenever you’re in a poetry class and it’s discussion time and you raise your hand to say that you like a poem, the professor will as you What You Like About It and you have to have some kind of definitive answer, in order to get a class discussion going, otherwise you’re going to look really dumb in front of a lot of other literary-type people. If you just say, ‘I don’t know really, I just like it a lot’ then there’ll be some awkward silence while the other students think snickeringly in tandem, ‘man, that dude just doesn’t get it.’ What’s ‘It,’ though? I used to kind of be really nervous about establishing what ‘It’ was about a lot of poems that I liked, and then I’d get frustrated because I also always thought that it sounded really stupid to spout off the same specific reasons for liking poems – because believe me, in class, you hear the same things over and over again, like ‘I like the imagry’ (that’s #1) or ‘the poem really flows’ or it’s the metaphors or the symbolism or the sounds or the way that X plays off Y, etc., etc. Whatever. Stock answers. It’s the same genus of stock responses as the ones you hear about burgeois-types at art galleries. ‘I love his use of color.’ (That makes me laugh endlessly – Leo even says it in Titanic.) ‘Wow, I really like the composition on this one.’ ‘Look at the play of light and shadow.’ Uh-huh. Even on the off chance that I DO like a painting because of its color, or its contrasts, I’d at least find another way to say it than what they say on every museum tour and in every Introduction to Art. Or do I even NEED to say it? Or anything? One thing I’ve learned from college (and I probably didn’t need to get the parents to shell out all the exorbiant amounts of tuition to get this particular nugget of wisdom) is that verbal appreciation can only go so far. At some point you start liking a poem for reasons that you yourself just don’t understand. You’re just not supposed to be able to articulate exactly WHY you like a certain thing in art or literature or whatever. It just makes you feel a certain way, and if you try to put that feeling into what few and feeble words we have at our disposal, you sort of cheapen the whole thing.” –Scott “Scotch” Herman  “A simple friend wonders about your romantic history. A real friend could blackmail you with it.”  “When I saw you, I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew…”  “I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood.”  “We can’t always be Washingtons, but we can all be patriots.” –Charles F. Browne  “If I have to lay an egg for my country, I’ll do it.” –Bob Hope  “We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees.” –FDR  “You cannot conquer America.” –William Pitt  “Too much time cannot be spent in a task that is to endure for centuries.” –Augustus Saint-Gaudens  "Wouldn't it be nice if we could live just twice in just one life? And then I would know what to do when I'm shaking in my shoes and my heart skips a beat over you."-The Promise Ring  "I'm drowning here, and you're describing the water."-"As Good As It Gets"  "Charlie Brown is the one person I identify with. CB was such a loser. He wasn't even the star of his own Halloween special."-Chris Rock  "I drowned my sorrows but they learned how to swim."-U2 "Until the End of the World"  "Anything worth doing is worth overdoing."-David Letterman
