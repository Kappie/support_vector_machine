I'm completely serious when I say I want to be a UPS truck driver ('cause if you know me at all by now you know I'm just odd like that), but I don't want to do that and only that. I want to do something else, where I can help people in ways other than delivering cardboard packages (....gorgeous ones...may I add....*cough*...) to them.  I do want to go to Columbia. With the current academic position I'm in, what I want quite possibly won't be what I get. I am trying to change this. I think I'm going to start taking more english honors classes during the summer, and start engaging in more activites that might look good on my college application. Unfortunately, one of these activities isn't creeping through a parking lot with engine-hungry-sugar, exhaust-pipe-happy-potatoes, and a baseball bat, but with the right medical care, I think I'll manage.  One thing I definitely will keep up with is writing on a regular basis. I have no proof of this, but I feel like putting my brain on paper (or computer screens...whatever) helps me analyze myself more easily. Putting my thoughts into words comes natrually to me, and I guess I should be thankful for that, if self-analysis happens to be a good thing. But, dude, look back at my posts from the beginning of my blogdom and compare them to what I write now. I amaze myself with how much I've matured. Don't get me wrong here- I still am an immature, naive freshman, but at least I recognize it, and if not embrace it openly, I accept and tolerate it. Just think- six months ago I though I knew everything my brain would allow. Now, I look back on my "old" (by half a year) self and laugh. And hell, I'm not even fifteen yet.   (OK, I realize that at this point I'm sounding a bit egocenteric, but go with the flow.)   Will I ever reach a point where I stop learning and put my knowledge to use in life? In ways, I guess not. Life's not about reaching goals like that. It's about working as you go along, putting the knowledge you've gained so far to good use, and being open about learning more. You can never know enough, and if you think you have it's only because you don't know that you don't know the things you don't know yet because you don't know them yet. Get me? Didn't think so (and I don't blame you...try figuring it out when you're really bored one day because it's not worth wasting valuable time on. Like that riddle.....How can you use only a jug that holds exactly 3 gallons, a jug that holds exactly 5 gallons, and an unlimited water supply to get exactly 4 gallons in one jar? Keep in mind the only exact way of measuring is by filling the jars- they don't have gallon marks on them.)   Off topic, off topic, I don't give a fuck.  My overall point: Life's wierd. But isn't that the point to everything?
