(please sing to the tune of britney spears' smash hit "Toxic")   check out btothethird.c-o-m it's awesome i'd go there right now it's a cool way to keep in touch with friends I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? at least when you update, you should do it more often.   now, i wouldn't have put in the last line, but how else would it rhyme?   Anyway, back to reality (oops there goes gravity)  You'll have to bear with me, my memory is a little fuzzy seeing as it's after one and i've been on my feet all day.  I do remember going to see the villiage (which sucked) but at least i kept people from getting scared (myself included).  Katie and Matt played drunk for y'all, and i have to thank all of my friends, all of whom advised me not to get in the car, most of whom offered to give me a ride home.  you should know that from a family of actors (...and matt) that we could fool y'all if we wanted.  MAJOR EVENT OF THE WEEK well, as probably none of you know (with the possible exception of mrs. davies, who i told in the car when she asked how involved in the theater our family was)  my father has been spending a lot of his time writing a play.  It is his second play, and his first production to be produced in it's entirety (the first scene of his first play won a ten minute play festival).   What does this have to do with anything?  well, this weekend we have invited some philly theater elite (including the artistic directors of three theaters) to attend a readthrough at our home.  AKA an opportunity for my parents to chill with their homies, impress the philly theater community, and fix my dads play all in one go.    Well, with so many people coming, we have been scourging the house, making it fit for human habitation.    so we have been cleaning or getting things for this party toda la semana.  no jokes.  I put my computer skillz to use (in getting out of real work)  to make an interactive visual database for mi padre.  He needed to scan and organize the actors, and i did him one better, including each of their contact info's and resume's.  All this in a handy little powerpoint.  you may ask how i know this,  well, besides my obvious genius, i learnt it in computer class.  I had to do something to keep myself distracted from hearing, seeing, or smelling mr. ripkey (*shudder*).  the point of this is, my mom told some people at the arden about it, and they might make it my graduation project.  (they currently store headshots and resume's in five filing boxes)  Anyway!   In getting ready for the party, we got rid of our sixteen year old couch (i'll miss you mr. springs-popping out the bottom!)  and We bought a new couch for the living room!!  well, COUCHES to be fair.  instead of one big one (what we traditionally have had)  we now have two loveseats facing each other.  tre adorable!  i have some great couch buying stories.  First off, we went to about a million stores, each more boring and footsore than the last.  When me and katie got bored, we went over to what looked like a high-class-business table and passed random papers back and forth, looking important and discussing our movie.*****see bottom of page for movie update... or just, ya know, wait till the end***  When we didn't find anything anywhere, we dropped by the new Raymour and Flannagan, despite their gouge-my-eyes-out commercials.  There we were occosted by TONY.  TONY is a very tall man, who i am SURE was trying to conceal a hunchback.  He had a very deep, slow, and creepy voice.  Now, this wouldn't be so bad, except for his shifty, shady eyes and easily excitable, stalker-like manner.  Also, i'm not altogether sure he wasn't hitting on my mom.  well, he kept turning up around corners when we least expected him, pushing sodas on us (date-rape-drug-city i'm sure) and talking about fabric guarantees.  Katie called him a shark, because he was always behind us, pretending to mind his own business, and then he'd circle and STRIKE.  one time, we were walking by the end tables, and i was sure we had lost him.  Me and katie couldn't crack jokes about him while he was around, and we both knew the other was holding them in.  I say something about pillows and then quickly whisper "I think he's out of earshot" "No!" she answers "he's here... somewhere"  All of a sudden he closes the door of a wardrobe he was pretending to inspect RIGHT IN FRONT OF US and asks us if we want to talk plaid.    This was a shady, shady man, and me and katie couldn't lose him fast enough, so we were glad when my mom decided to get us some pizza (by now it was seven or so) to wait for my dad to get home.  We ate at RInos, and met up with my dad when we got back to R  Tony was there, but he had another potential sell (TWO middle aged ladies)  and he handed us off to his young apprentice.  This kid wasn't so creepy, in fact, the only time he creeped us out was when, just as we're about to go upstairs, we noticed him across the store on the computer.  We walked about ten feet to the stairs, then climbed up.  HE WAS WAITING FOR US AT THE TOP!!!  ...one staircase in the whole place...  Anyway, my dad was hungry and cranky from working and not-eating all day, so whenever we expressed a preference about sofas (i.e. no poufs at the top, no faux-suede)  he snapped at us.  One time, when i said "look at this room, pouf-city U.S.A"  and then a couple minutes later katie said "Wow, this room is main street Pouf-ville" (blatant joke stealing!!) my dad turned on us and seethed "Girls, we have decided to spend a lot of money today, calm down, this is NOT AN ICE CREAM STORE".    it took all the strength we possessed to keep straight faces, and from that point on, anytime we'd see a poufed faux suede piece, we'd wride ice cream orders like ' 1 chocolate' in the fabric.  My dad was being kind of crazy that day.  when we were looking at a couch that they were getting serious about buying (i still didn't like it)  i said so.  I said these words "i don't think i like this couch too much"  My dad turned on me and said "JESSICA!!  STOP IT RIGHT NOW.  STATING AN OPINION IS ONE THING, BUT MAKING FUN OF A SERIOUS PURCHASE IS ANOTHER!! YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS AND MAKING FUN OF THAT IS MAKING FUN OF US. DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST TIME WE WENT COUCH SHOPPING?"   ME: "what?  um. no?" I had no idea what this had to do with anything.   turns out he yelled at me was because he 'remembered'  me making fun of him a year and a half ago, when we were buying the family room couch, which is why i was so confused.  see i wasn't there that night eighteen months ago when KATIE called him a baby because she cracked a joke and he threw a hissyfit.   I didn't get in trouble, and it wasn't that big of a deal, but for about half an hour i was thouroughly confused.  when we actually bought the couches, i was also thoroughly shocked.  before i continue, i should explain that me and my sister play a game (i'm the best at it) in furniture stores.  One of us points out a piece of furniture, and the other has to identify what piece of literature it bests belongs in, where specifically, and why.  Yeah, we're dorks.  so my mom had been very keen on this red patterned couch, it was very griffindor common room, covered in these kind of gold emblems and patterned with other faded color diamonds (patterns are HARD to describe)  Well, i didn't much care for it, but its partner was a tan number that i thought was stunning, so that was at the top of our list.  as we walked for a final check upstairs (to see if we missed anything before we bought them) katie pointed out these blue checked ones for me to identify.  It was very obvious that they belonged in maycomb county, in the living room of one atticus finch.  we kept walking, and after the vomit-plaid-don't-make-fun-of-purchases-blamed-for-katies-outburst, i found myself back at the blue couches!!  My parents loved them and took them home dat veery dai (said amerigo bonasera style)  Ah, it has been almost an hour since i started this post, and i am sleepy.  i don't wanna be cranks for the big shots tomorrow, so i'm going to bed.   The only other things of intrest that happened to me this week were not that interesting, except for the notice at the bottom of the page.  Well, once we met a squib at walmart (he stirred the paint for my room) and me and katie made a wand for matt for his birthday, but other than that, nada.    I promise i'll write about the bigshots after they leave manana.  In the meantime, visit a newly reactivated btothethird and LEAVE SOME COMMENTS.  if you don't keep up the record of at least 5 comments a post, i won't post until there are 5 comments.   jess    *****Movie update******  we have written a script and animated a production company logo.  This movie is NOT the ice cream sherpa movie (though i am in the midst of writing a script, four pages down, w00t)  this is a flash cartoon-turned webcomic-turned short film that me and katie star in.  It all stemmed from a discussion we had about pancakes, but i will tell you no more.  ok, i'll tell you two more things.  1. We need a site to host it on, so you may not see it until then  2. It doesn't have what some movie coinesseurs would call a 'plot' seeing as it was a comic at one point.  the plot is loose, but we're planning to make it more of an episodial thing.
