Just a little band of silver that no one would care much about except that I did because Syd bought it for me.  Four years of never letting it leave my finger, and I took it off in art class to make a fucking clay pot.            Josh, Ryan, and I spent a good couple of hours digging through garbage cans of wet clay and came up empty handed.  If it was there, then it slipped through our fingers, and I left the art room with my hand unnervingly light and my mood unnervingly heavy.     And my dentist wonders why I grate my teeth.
