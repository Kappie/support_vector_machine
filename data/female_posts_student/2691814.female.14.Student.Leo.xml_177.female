Anyway, ya, i bought some stuff, clothes, and today im going shopping again at the lil mall. ya, so at the mall, when we were close to being finished, the alarm goes off in the store. Okay well you think i'd be used to it because in HCMS the fire alarms are like Super loud but these matched it. So when we finally pay, we walk out of the store and it turns out that every alarm in the mall is going off! It was just one huge beeeeeeeeeeep at that time mixed together with all the little beeps in each store. We went into spencers while the alarms were still going off, but you couldnt hear them in there due to the loud music...i like the workers there now, i mean, they blasted good music so you dont have to listen to the shrieking. lol, ya but then we leftand got home around 9:30 ish.    I watched the new Degrassi, Emma kicked Alex's a$$ lol, it was a good fight haha. Ok well i guess thats it and Ryan finally wrote in his blog...its about time!!
