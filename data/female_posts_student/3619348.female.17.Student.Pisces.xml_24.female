I have started many a journal in my time, but I HATED the idea of my innermost feelings lying around in a book somewhere, and I was never really motivated to keep them up.  This resulted in numerous small books with about a months worth of entries, and many a page torn out.  I do believe this will be good for me though, I need a place where I can vent a  little but not worry about stressing out my family/close friends too much.  Just a place to say whatever, the important things, as well as the stupidest, minuscule thoughts.  Plus I would very much like to improve my writing skills, and practice makes perfect, no?  So thatâ€™s that.  It has begun.
