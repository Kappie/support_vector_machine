But then at the end when sam goes "do you think we'll ever be a story mr. frodo. 'i want to here about that brave frodo, dad'" and then frodo goes "your leaving out a cheif character, sam the brave. I want to hear about sam. Frodo wouldn't have gotten anywhere without sam. Frodo needs Sam." Thats where i lost it, i couldn't help laughing, I wanted to be quiet because people always hate people who laugh in theaters at inoppertune times but it was soooo FUNNY! i discussed this with camille and the resulting conversation was quite amusing, here is the funniest part (i think)  LOTRBabe (1:24 PM):	lol!!!!!! i know! i leaned over to my friend kaysea and was all "frodo likes talking in 3rd person"
