"Mark has got his work" They say "Mark lives for his work" And "Mark's in love with his work" Mark hides in his work  MARK  But from what?  ROGER  From facing your failure, facing your loneliness Facing the fact you live a lie Yes, you live a lie -- tell you why You're always preaching not to be numb When that's how you thrive You pretend to create and observe When you really detach from feeling alive  MARK  Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive  ROGER  Poor baby  MARK  Mimi still loves Roger Is Roger really jealous Or afraid that Mimi's weak  ROGER  Mimi did look pale  MARK  Mimi's gotten thin Mimi's running out of time Roger's running out the door  ROGER  No more! Oh no! I've gotta go  MARK  Hey, for somebody who's always been let down Who's heading out of town?  ROGER  For someone who longs for a community of his own, Who's with his camera, alone? (ROGER takes a step to go, then stops, turns.) I'll call I hate the fall  I'll be out of town for a week. See ya.
