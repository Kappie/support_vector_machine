My memory is wonderful and I can never completely stop liking boys that I am crazy-bonkers about. I hear a song on the radio and i want to call Scott, who was actually my boyfriend, so I suppose that's not a very good example, is it? I write a note and I want to hand it to Nate. I long for conversation and, in turn, Frankie. I drive by Frontier City and want to sit close to Drew. I swim and want to swim with Ken. I watch anyone making out and I want to be making out.   More tomorrow. My mom wants me to go to bed now.
