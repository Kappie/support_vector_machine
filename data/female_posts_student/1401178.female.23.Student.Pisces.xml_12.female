I can't believe it myself. There I was, just typing 'John Vause' on the group search, thinking 'Maybe..'. Then voila! There is a group dedicated to him. So now I'm officially  urlLink the group 's 6th or maybe 7th member. Hurrrah!!! There's a group to share my fixation.  I was going to put a link to another blog,  urlLink qHate.com . I read it once a while, the blog is about 'love and hate in Quwait'. It has a lot point of view from people who are Quwaities and live in Quwait. Right now, the reports on CNN are all about the allegation on Syria being 'helpful' to a lot of Iraqi officials. Whatever. Can people just hold that thoughts? There are a lot of other issues in Iraq than that, and more important! Humanitarian aids, please! A lot of people are suffering because of their wounds, but no humanitarian aids just yet. People are moving to slow. Get those damn aids there! You have troops all over, security is not supposed to be an hold-up for the aid. Aaaaaargh!!! I wish I could do more than this ranting. Is there any big air vessels that can carry a whole hospital? Guess not.  Oh what else? What else? Oh yeah, seems that Francesco Coco (the football/soccer player) is injured and would need a month to recover. Which means that he probably won't played again the rest of the season. Oh well, look at the bright side. I only need to watch 2 games now, Milan's and Juve's. Ah, 10.30 already. Better get going and watch that BOB vid. Let see...which episodes??
