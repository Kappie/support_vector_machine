I'm aware that I occasionally do this, and I don't particularly like it much.  I mean, I spent a good deal of time in my later years of high school dwelling on the events of my sophomore year.  Maybe this dwelling is somehow linked to old questions of regret, something I've mentioned in this blog before.  Anyway, I feel like my desire to keep a diary (well, in the past) or a blog, and to keep all old correspondences in part fuels this living in the past thing.  I was never more proud of myself than when I was finally able to throw away my old letters/pictures/etc from the Jason days.  And although less so, when I was able to let go and delete all those old high school emails.  Why do I want to be reminded of who I used to be?  Even in college, when I went home for breaks I would pull out the old diaries for a long evening's read, alternatively cringing and laughing at my silly little self.  I suppose do I like to remember certain moments in life, how I was feeling and what I was thinking.  Is there anything wrong with this?
