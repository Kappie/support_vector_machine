An energetic screwball comedy-action-adventure, that is expertly paced.  Now if you are just getting back from the moon, the story(based on a children's book by William Steig) deals with a big, green, swamp-dwelling ogre who, despite his difficult manner, found love with a ogrette/princess named Fiona. In the first film, Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) were married. Now, immediately after their honeymoon, they are summoned by the bride's parents to a festive welcome. The problem: The folks don't know that Shrek is an ogre; they kept Fiona's ogre-ness hidden for most of her life and expect her to marry the dashing but superficial Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett). Complicating matters is Fiona's Fairy Godmother, hilariously voiced by Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) as a cross between Estee Lauder and the Wicked Witch of the West.  The fairy tale characters from the first installment all reappear, but as much as Diaz and Myers earn star billing for their voice talents, they are curiously toned down next to their co-stars. Saunders gets a big part, as does John Cleese, who voices the role of Fiona's father the king of Far Far Away, but these characters get a bit tedious(just a bit) and I feel that they exist solely to drive the plot.  The real humor comes, once again from Murphy, whose Donkey is so genuinely funny and clever that he very nearly steals the film. Except that it's stolen by Banderas as a rogue Puss In Boots outlaw hired by the King to do in Shrek. His Puss is so endearing and charming in his less-than-honorable pursuits and so feline in his self-deluded pride, that the film brightens and magic happens whenever Puss appears on the screen.  Now officially this is the first Disney animated feature that I have seen from start to finish. And yes that includes   The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Finding Nemo  , and a list that seems endless. But I really enjoyed this movie, the only thing that took away from this movie was the crowd. I expected that, with all the little ones in the theatre, it would be loud and a lot of annoying voices would be coming from all over, but the movie was so enjoyable that it over-shadowed the noise coming from all around me.   Grade: B+
