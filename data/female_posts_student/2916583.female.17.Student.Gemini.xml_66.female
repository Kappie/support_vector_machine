My stomach hurts like crazy, and I'm still burping from what is perhaps the second most disgusting edible substance ever invented: alka seltzer.  See, I'm a HUGE baby when it comes to stomachaches, and I was looking for something to ease the monster brewing inside my stomach organ.  I thought, it bubbles, it fizzes (and it will keep a cold away), it will be just like Ginger Ale, a miracle substance that, unfortunately, my grandfather was out of.  I was WRONG!  It was sickly sweet and slimy, much like eating soapy water with sugar.  However, I have never eaten soap, so I'm not sure exactly what it was like.  I do know it was disgusting, and that I got my sister to tip it down the sink after about five sips.  In case you're wondering, the most disgusting substance known to man is Nyquil.  I'd pay good money to watch someone chug a bottle of that stuff.  Number three is definitely any cherry flavored medicine.  Nothing against medicine, I just don't like it, other than amoxicilin and a few other pills.  Man, that takes me back.  I took that stuff like crazy for my ears, cause I was always getting earaches.  Hmm, it really helped (for those who don't know me, I have terrible hearing).  However, that bubblegum taste completely makes up for it.  I miss that stuff. I bought this new stuff yesterday, that hair lightener I've wanted.  I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet, cause I haven't been in the sun in awhile.  I did use this texturizer stuff that came with it, and I like it.  You spray it in your hair, twist it and air dry.  I must admit, that's the closest my hair's been to beach water dried in it without bein at the beach.  My hair was really stringy, though (Emily taught me that word, it means your hair looks like crimped spaghetti - that's not how she explained it, but it's how I remember it).  I really liked the look; it looked very "I've just rolled out of bed, it's humid, I air-dried my hair but my hair still looks decent."  I'll prolly wear my hair like that more if I can find a larger version of that.  I may do the cheap version, and fill up a bunch of squirt bottles with sea water (it says it's sea water), and put in a tiny bit of virgin olive oil and lemon.  I'll let u kno how that one works out. As I normally do on a lazy summer day, I spent the day bonding with the television.  I was watching this thing on Ripley's Believe It or Not, and in India, they put cow's urine all over their homes and faces.  I looked it up online, and their holy book says that killing a cow is punishable by death.  Listen to this:   This explains why during the Second World War, "American servicemen in Calcutta were instructed that if a traffic situation arose in which the driver had a choice of striking a cow or a human, hit the human and proceed without stopping to a police station"  Wow.  I like cows (they're cute), but I couldn't hit a human being over one.  I love animals and all, but I couldn't kill a human over one.  I definitely couldn't put any pee on myself either.  The bathroom itself grosses me out.  Heather W. once told me that the particles in your toilet can travel up to six feet, and ever since then, I've never looked at the room in the same way.   Well my home antidote (ice cream left over from the party I threw for my sister) isn't working as well as hoped.  In defense of ice cream, it did work well while I was eating it.  Maybe there's still some Pepto-Bismol from my dad's trip to Peru last summer.  I'm gonna go tear apart the linen closet.  Later.
