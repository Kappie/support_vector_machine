Granted they have a pool, but I have a nasty bruise that I am not feeling like exposing as of yet. Anyway, it'll be nice for my mum to get out and see some people other than us and the people from her work. I come to the conclusion that I just generally want a guy. It is non-specific. Or at least it had better be because I am not(read:no way in hell) going back to the ex. I was seriously contemplating that but it would be a very very bad idea. Almost as bad as the one that started me going out with him. Yeah that was really bad. I talked to Erin last night and she is trying to get over someone also. There is a very sexy musician in her future though. That is one thing that I definitely do not have. If only... A sexy musician would be really nice. Just think about it, a gorgeous sensitive musician. That really would be perfect but it is also really too bad that it will not be happening. Especially because the only musician guys I know, while be very cute, are also very taken. Being in the school band does not count. I want a rock and roll guy, if anything.  I am expecting a visitor who is still not here. Which is making me sad because I am hungry and would like to eat lunch. Plus I have a huge list of stuff I have to do before my mum gets home in three hours.  1.) Write Erin an email because my other friends don't listen but she promised to. Will talk about stupid guys. Because some of you are very stupid. Not all. I am not that bitter anymore! 2.) Have to hang out laundry. I hate the sun so will have to wear sunscreen to avoid and burn and eventually an allergic reaction. 3.) Put away all the dishes and do the ones that are in the sink. I hate doing dishes. It is revolting and disgusting.  4.) Make my dad a Fathers Day gift or at least a card. He still hasn't phoned so, we haven't been able to ask if the patients are allowed to receive mail. We are hoping that they are but hey you never know. And it has to be mailed toady so I have to do this if nothing else. And really I have to do everything else because if not I will be in serious trouble from my lovely mum. 5.) Try to start cleaning my room as it is a filthy mess again. It should only take the rest of the summer. All right, so that isn't that much but I should go now and start to make a dent in at least some of those things. So, cheers!
