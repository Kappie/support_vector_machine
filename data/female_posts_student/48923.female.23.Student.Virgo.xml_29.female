(we did know that a lot of stuff goes on behind closed doors, and weren't worried about that..)   but then we realized, there were TWO more floors of booths full of toys that were larger than the first level we explored.  i'm in the state of mental/visual overload.   imagine a never ending toy r us, but with smiley people everywhere trying to grab your attention with their product (that they're playing with, of course) until they realize you're only Guest status.     at first, when we started to walk around we didn't quite understand why there were back massage places... but it all began to make sense after several more hours of seeing toys and no end in sight.  disturbing things to note, before i collapse into a heap.. 1. most toy buyers are very old white men. 2. a disturbing amount of toy presenters are older women in skirts. 3. a section of these women are dressed up, like mermaids, in a leather catsuit, showing what should be illegal amounts of clevage. 4. i got more swag that i could carry, even though i was trying to *not* get swag. 5. the more clevage i showed, the more swag i got.
