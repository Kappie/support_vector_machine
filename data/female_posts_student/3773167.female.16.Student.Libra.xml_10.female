Homework is killer: 3 AP Classes at an hour of homework each, and Dual Enrolled Plane Trig that usually sucks up another hour a night or so. So far I'm loving Trig... due to some unusual goings-on in the guidance office I somehow ended up in Mr. Durden's only trig class with 15 other people, including Chad--my second--and Sallah. (That makes my 4th period trig the smallest class in the school following the SPED class and AP Chemistry, which only 10 people are brave enough to take. There are 5 other trig classes with 30 people each in them, which only makes my class even stranger.) Accident? I think not. Durden wanted me in his class again so he could give me some more interesting problems to sink my teeth into.  I need to finish typing up the Math Team and Mu Alpha Theta flyers for Club Day on Tuesday or Mrs. Doo will eat me. "Math Research" (better known as "Math Team Administration Period") has been kind of a drag so far, but I guess it comes along with being President of Mu Alpha Theta. Things should pick up as soon as competition season starts and we start planning the calendar girl competition/fundraiser to raise travel money.  Speaking of money, the School Advisory Council is cutting Math Team's funding this year so I have to come up with some new fundraising ideas. We're still planning on selling advertisments to go in the school calendar, but we need supplemental income or else the trips are going to cost the students a lot more this year than they have in the past. Choir and band have candy sales covered year round. Car washes are ineffective and time consuming. I was thinking about maybe getting Sweet Temptations to donate some candy and have kids pay to guess the amount of candy in jars, or something to that effect. I might also look into a sponsorship from FES or Buffalo Rock... they've helped us out some in the past.  In other news, I recently started selling on eBay. I've always wanted to try it before but until recently I couldn't create an account (no CC number). I sold a few textbooks I paid $3 for at Goodwill... they went for ~$30 each, so I made a handsome profit while they got an awesome deal. It can be a lot of hassle, but it's a nice source of extra income; I'm doing at least as well as my friends working stupid jobs for $5-something an hour, but I have flexible hours (or no hours at all, if I don't feel like it.) It's mostly a weekend thing. I make 7-day listings starting on Sunday... they end the following weekend and I drop the items off at the post office on the way home from school Monday.  I mentioned making a good profit on those books, but that won't last. The only reason those books went for a lot is because the fall college semester is starting up soon and people need cheap books. So now I'm trying to think of other things I could sell that doesn't require a lot of hassle (taking pictures of unique items.) I'm thinking I might try to sell some DVDs or CDs next, perhaps some FAR items. Who knows.
