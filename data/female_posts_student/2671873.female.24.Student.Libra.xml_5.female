Its so odd, because the daffodils are peaking through the snow and you can tell Mother Nature did not expect this sudden surprise.  However, I must admit it has been fun to throw a snow ball or two and walk outside and feel the crunch of the snow beneath my feet (ok so its not snow...its slush).  I wish I had a digital camera so I could show all of you this amazing view and snow covered hills.  I don't think I have really seen anything like it.  Snow covered mountains, yes....snow covered hills in Ireland NO.  So today I am grateful for God for giving me one more reason to love this country even more.  There is something to be said for sunshine and snow all in the same day.  I guess it just shows that God is good....All the time.  Hopefully I will have a picture to share.
