I've kinda gotten used to not having it. At least now I can watch bbcamerica and ifc religiously again. hahaha. a few minutes ago mom threw a magazine at me "Pottery Barn Teen" the title alone is enough to make you cringe. Actually there were a lot of kick-ass things in there. It made me want to completely redo my room. And then I was like "oh wait, i have no money and my parents sure as hell aren't going to pay to redo my room, so giving me this magazine was really just a cruel joke on my mom's part" but anyway in like every single room they have they have their own laptop and i'm like "hmmm" gears are turning (which is quite unusual actually) so i'm going to go look up iBook prices (yes another mac, mainly because i don't want to pay for my own internet and networking a pc to a mac is much more expensive than networking a mac to a mac, besides mac isn't that bad)
