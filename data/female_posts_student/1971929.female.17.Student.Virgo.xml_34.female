The boys all decided to wear Zoot Suits and Fedoras. We nerds had a good time at the Italian Restaurant pretending to be Mafia members.  In order of appearance: Julie, Lucas, Jared, Katherine, Talley, Robert  Julie: That's me. Lucas: My date - we were still going out at the time of this photo. Jared: Lucas' best friend since like 6th grade. Katherine: My old best friend from back in 8th grade, we had some fallings out, I'm not really sure what happened, but we're fine now. We hooked Jared and Kat up because they both wanted to go, but neither had dates. They agreed to go with each other and they went in our group, of course. Talley: My best friend, duh.  Robert: Talley's date. He had a thing for Talley, but I'm not sure that he still does. Talley had an on and off thing for him, so she asked him to prom because I wanted her to go. Thanks Talley.
