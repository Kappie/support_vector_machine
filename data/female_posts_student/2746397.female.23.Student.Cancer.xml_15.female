We're getting kind of excited.  My Dad will be doing my posts for me in country.  I'll email him and he'll post.  I can't send anything out that is of a sensitive nature.  So if the posts seem kinda wierd, we'll you'll have to deal with it.  Thank you all for your support it is apprectiated by myself and those whose lives may be about to change (which also includes me).
