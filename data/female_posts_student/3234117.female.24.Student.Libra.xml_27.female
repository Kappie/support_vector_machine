Hey I need stuff to fill my time at the realty place.  All I do is file, file, and then file some more.  I'm actually running out of things to file.  This is not good as I need to get my 14 hours of work in a week.  Now do I work all 14 hours? Not really.  Not so much.  Rarely do I even get in 14 hours, but I probably only actually do filing for about an hour and a half the whole 4-5 hours I'm there.  I'm gonna get fired I just know it.  Alicia can comment on my work ethic as she spoke to a previous boss of mine on one ocassion who totally bitched her out about me.  Oh well.  Sorry Alicia!
