Houses with more bedrooms and a yard and pets allowed and a dishwasher and a big kitchen and a great room that I can use as a studio so I can start painting again. He wants to keep his place in Milwaukee for a bit, but if we find some place we love we'll sign the lease and the boys and I will move in and he'll pay half the rent and move in gradually and wouldn't that be awesome? He loves me, Thalia! And the great shit about that is  I  love  him,  too. So, my question for you is, should I be looking for a place with a bedroom for you, too? You know, so you could live rent free in exchange for a minimal amount of childcare, go to school at a local tech place  and  hang out with me a whole lot? *waggling my eyebrows* The only rule of the house is that after the kids go to sleep, you have to walk around nude and maybe jump up and down a little.
