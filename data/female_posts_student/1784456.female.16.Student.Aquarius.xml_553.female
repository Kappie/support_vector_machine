So every one wrote over it and Laura put I heart Postman Pat but I don't! Oh, and apparantly I'm Bob the frog! Wow, kind of cool I guess, so long as Mango doesn't eat me! Hehe! Oh if you've got Kazaa then download: don't let the bastards grind you down by the toasters! It's really cool and a good pick-me-up! Or buy the moon ska europe cd. Oh, and guys, I'll try and copy it or record it for you! It twas scary, I came home and all the lights were on and the computer was turned on but no one's home! Ok, so it was my brother (doh!) Hmm... oh and I was going a bit hyper today! (Just a bit!) Teehee, scarily so... and what's this? I've run out of things to say! Guess I'll go hide in my hole now...
