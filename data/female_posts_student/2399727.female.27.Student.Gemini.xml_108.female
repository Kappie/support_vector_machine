Thought suddenly struck me today: I won't be able to stay in this housing if I do theology.  So, not only will I be penniless, I will also be homeless (theoretically of course) ... I am so mixed up and frustrated and I can't decide if this is God telling me to give up literally everything and follow him (in other words, do theology) or if this is God telling me that I should go with my original decision, which is definitely easier, and do education.    PP was a  big  help.  Quoth he,  "The unforeseen fallout from changing majors (loss of money and housing) is not God saying anything to you by means of those things, it seems to me.  It also seems to me that you are not only discerning a vocation and career, but also mixed in with this is your need for psychological and emotional safety and security.  Indeed, it is possible that this latter need is the one driving everything else.   Your spiritual director needs to know your full story so that all the data needed for a good discernment is in place.  The recent written recommendation you showed me would seem to indicate that your references do not know as much as they perhaps should about you."     I think I'm going to swear for the first time in my blog ...  More to come...
