It's Spring Fling week, tonight's video night or something, and I think I'll go just so I can watch Steven's 30 minute monster movie, his stuff is always so cool. Then me and Charlotte are goin' to see 13 Going On 30... we'll see how that is, I've gotten mixed reviews. My dad liked it, so there's a chance.  THREE DAY WEEKEND Oh the possiblities of a three day weekend. You can do CRAZY things like, have a sleepover on a SUNDAY or... well that about sums it up. Either way that means that there's a four day work week! Oh how I am easily overjoyed. I got a pretty red shirt yesterday and I feel very ... red. Or is this magenta? But I feel red. Even though.. it's magenta. My throat hurts very badly, I must stop singing so loud in my car. But when it's Queen you just got-ta!
