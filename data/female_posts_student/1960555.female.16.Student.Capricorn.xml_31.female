There was understanding and formatting and the need of html knowlege which I lack unbelievably... But I figured it out all on my own, with out once threatening the life of my computer! (Yes, you should be cheering for me right now! -bows- "Thank you, Thank you")  So now you can check up on the comings and goings of my website (which I really should update soon, I've just been really preocupied here), theres a link to my favorite band (actually one of my favorite bands) Mest, and a link to Punk Lyrics.  Good site... full of... lyrics.  Also, I've added one of my numerous email addys up top, so feel free to send me some emails, tell me to shut up or whatever.  I'm out... school tomorrow and I need sleep like you wouldn't believe.
