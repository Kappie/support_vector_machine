Alice if you're reading this, I want you to know I'm always there if you need to talk. Pray =)  So many things make me realize so much. And everything makes me so sad. The way so many people can't see such simple things. We study our asses off to get into university to get a good job to get our children into a good school to get into university to get a good job and the cycle goes on and on. There are so many solutions that people don't realize. I'm not really as dumb as I pretend to be. I think a lot. Probably too much for my own good. But I still do think. Some people realize things that others don't. Things that can fix up so many problems... Iunno... I'm just yapping away now... well, dinner's ready. I'll blog tomorrow maybe. I'm off.
