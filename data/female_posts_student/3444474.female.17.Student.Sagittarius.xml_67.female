It's so cool, I can take videos, pictures, send picture messages, I downloaded ringtones. I have downloaded "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand, "Cold Hard Bitch" by Jet, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen and "California" by Phantom Planet. :D  I went bowling tonight, as the night progressed I got better. I actually got a strike and a couple spares if I remember correctly, which was good. Cameron got four strikes, two of which were in a row, which was pretty sweet. Dos Equis, lol.  He asked me to marry him. I said yes. Whether or not he truly meant it, I dunno, but it's fun to pretend sometimes, lol.   He seemed to get along really well with Daniel and Camila (my god brother and sister) who we went with, along with Carissa and their mom, and Katrina, who's also their sister. That was good. He was being touchy feely, lol, which I dunno how they reacted to it, but, I didn't mind, it's just how he is with me. I like it, for once I don't have to initiate anything. It's a beautiful thing.  I took a picture of him on my phone, it's now my backround on the phone (everyone do it with me now: "awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww").  All in all, a good night :)
