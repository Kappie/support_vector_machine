I don't know what I did, but if it were to happen right now, I don't think I would forgive easily. What a sec., what am I forgiving anyways? There was nothing done wrong except MY stupid mistake to be the bitch that I am. I hate myself more and more everyday, and I'm about to take a knife and plunge it through my heart. I wish I could rewind my life to the first big mistake that happened, which was being born. I can't wait to go to college and never see some of these people ever again. Unless I become friends with everyone I thought I cared about again, cause I do like people, and being with them. There's nothing wrong with you, just me...
