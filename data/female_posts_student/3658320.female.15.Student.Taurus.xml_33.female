Neva say I love uif it isn't really thereNeva talk bout feelingsif you really don't careNeva hold my handif u'r gonna break my heartNeva say u are gonnaIf u dont plan to startNeva look into my eyesIf all u do is lieNeva say helloIf u realy mean goodbyeIf u realy mean forevaThen please say ull try ..Never say forever..Because forever makes me cry..  You know, the worst part about having to fall asleep when you have a broken heart is having to wake up, because right when you start to open your eyes you are about to feel happy until you realize your life is terrible and the pain nearly swallows you whole..*  I loved you more than I have ever loved anyone. Why did you hurt me? You caused a lot of pain and you took a small piece of my heart with you. I try to forget you but something... something tells me not to. All I need, is to see you again... I need to know if it was real. I need you to look my in the eye and tell me that it wasn't.... But most of all... I need to see the look in your eyes when you say it. That will tell me all I need to know... and maybe then, I can get over you... or maybe, just maybe, I'll still let you keep that piece of my heart that you took away.      wow..my life kinda sucks rite now..i dont no how i feel..i'm in total shock! how could someone do this? i dont no wat else to say..i guess these poems kinda show how i feel rite now! heartbroken..i just need some1 and the some1 i need is the person who can't help me..                                                      :'(    Melissa-
