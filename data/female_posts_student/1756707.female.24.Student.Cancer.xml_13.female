Blend together, then add to potatoes: 4 oz sour cream 3 oz cream cheese, cut up 1 T butter 1 t onion or garlic salt (more to taste) 1/4 t pepper (more to taste)  Put potato mixture in greased casserole dish - I prefer a low-sided oval Corningware dish - and top with: 1/4 - 1/2 C milk 1 T butter  Bake uncovered at 350F for 1 hour, stirring twice. Can be made in advance, then heated up - just be mindful of moisture and add more milk or sour cream as necessary. When I make them in advance, I usually halve the baking time - baking for 25-30 minutes, then covering with foil until it's time to prepare the meal - then baking another 30-45 minutes, adding milk or sour cream and topping with more butter as necessary.  I sometimes like to add 1 C cheddar cheese and more garlic - the cheese tends to burn so if you add it, you'll need to stir more often. I hate peeling vegetables - hate it hate it hate it - but it's worth the ten minutes with the peeler to have these potatoes. I know this all sounds like propaganda - but try it! You'll like it! I've been assured that they're just as good with low-fat ingredients.
