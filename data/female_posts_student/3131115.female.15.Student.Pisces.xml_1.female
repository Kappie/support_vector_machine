I feel like him and I have something in common. Tonight, I came home from the movies and a great day with Bill, and my mom says that Nibby is being taken to Pennsylvania. Something shitty always has to happen. My best friend is being taken away from me. He's mine...no matter what my sister or anyone says. I love him. Everything is taken from me..always. I'm beginning to think that Im not aloud to be happy. William is trying to make things better, saying that we can go pick one out at the pet store and such..but I dont know if I want another one. I'm thankful that he's there for me when I need him, like he has been since I started feeling this overwhelming sense of lonliness all of a sudden. *sigh*...I dont think that things could be going much worse. I'm feeling sorry for myself...Im so selfish. Going to go cry myself to sleep...  -Hold on to me, we're fading fast Nothing in this life will ever last Attaching myself is only a curse Dont think things could be much worse-   ~You think that Im a child and I may just be but children are able to have responsibility Willing to give up space to make a new home for something neglected, and always alone Something in common, this creature and I have tell me, wanting to help, now is that so bad?~    Im alone....again.
