So I've wondered for a while if my computer burns them in right format at all.   But just now, my housemate Terhi, tried playing a CD that I burned for her on her stereos (she's listened to it from her computer only so far) and it works! So... my first suspicion was if her stereo system is able to play CDs in other formats also. I don't know, because she didn't know when I asked her. Not I have to do some research... and go see what the technical info on stereosystems of today is, lol.  I'm sure some people find my stuff amusing.... but hey, it's my life :P Laugh all you want :D So do I! Hahaha.
