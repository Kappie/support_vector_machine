Its been an aweful long day but I came home to my roommate offering me some Filipino food which was awesome. Who would have known that having a 40 year old mother of two living in my room would come in so tasty. Oh by the way, can I have Montana back when you guys are done with it. I think I could do better things than fill it with radiation and then Sean wouldn't have to jack any nukes for you. Just a thought!  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');
