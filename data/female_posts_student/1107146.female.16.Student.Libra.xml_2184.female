And Sky Masterson...well, whoever he was...made a rousing performance, mostly since every time he hit a note, it was so flat everyone woke up. God bless the guy, he tried hard, and that's all that matters. Well, at least it looked like he tried hard. But you never know.  We were looking for you. I took Jonathan Thompson and Billy was there (eventually), but no dice. But it's all good. You could see Abby if you looked really really hard. I did, and Jonathan said he did, but he's just such an agreeable guy, you never know. Hm.   Yeah, I'm really stalling for time here. I don't want to do this stupid paper. I went to the Mainstreet Festival with my mommy, I cut the grass, I shot the shit with Alex for a while, I'm on here, I've checked my email a couple of times...anything except doing this stupid paper. O well. It's alright because this is the last one for this entire year! Woo! Isn't that scary?  Ok ok, sense of duty just kicked me in the pants, I'm going.
