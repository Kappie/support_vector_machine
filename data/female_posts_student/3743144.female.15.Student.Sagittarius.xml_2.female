I would've given anything to have wut u had w/him and u juss...killed wut u guys had...and now b/c of that I'm hurt more than ever b/c I was stupid enough to pick up ur scraps...I was stupid enough to believe I could've had wut u had, but no...u ruined any chances of that ever happening cuz u ruined him you have no idea wut ur irresponsible actions do to others around u b/c ur hurting them more than u think...ur hurting me more than u think...and u said u wud never do that to me cuz I was ur best friend but I guess ur word doesn't count for anything b/c I'm through holding it to ur last breath...I'm through thinking you'll keep ur promises...I'm through hoping u'll change cuz it's not going to happen...u'll never change cuz this is how u've always been and this is how u'll remain... it's clear to me now that I've put too much into this and I've wasted all my time caring about it this much cuz none of it is working; I'm not helping u in any way. My words are worthless to ur actions...so now everything u do is worthless to me b/c I'm sick of trying to help u...I'm sick of hoping u'll listen cuz my words don't even get thru to u...just continue screwing up your life more than it already is...I mean u've done a good enough job without anybody's help already haven't u? do u have any idea wut u've done now?
