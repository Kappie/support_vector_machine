So in short only my mom told me and a few friends from online who I had been gloating to for a few days. I went to work today with my landlord. Which wasn't so bad but he had forgotten it was my birthday too. Then I went to dinner with my mom and a friend...to IHOP and got my usual...if you know me you know what it is. Then just chilled with my girl. So in short it was like any other day. So thank all who membered and fuck all who didn't care enough to give me a call.
