It is with a culpable fascination that I hide them Each by Each by the stark of midnight. I take them out secretly One by one and revel in the juicy desire of pain I so badly yearn to entreat upon myself. Do not pity me, Friend. I would rather you merely observe and take part in this delicious perversion of  the human soul.
