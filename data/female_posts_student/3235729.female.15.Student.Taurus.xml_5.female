I lift the veil up to reveal fascination, and if you crave it then you know that you are injured. And I'm holding on...And I'm holding on..." 'The Distillers - Love is Paranoid' 4 days...4 fucking days! There was an article in the Previews section in the newspaper yesterday..."The Distillers Provide A High-Energy Show"...This concert is gonna kick so much ass! Hehe! We've got it!   ...so I'm currently on the phone with Lindsay. And we're just talking about whatever, and she's like "I'm gonna go get a needle and thread." "What the hell?!" "...I need to fix my backpack. No, actually I'm going to make a skirt and a pair of pants. And wear them. At the same time." "Hoh. Big skants." (skirt pants) "...Or pirts." (pants skirt) Then we were discussing how Mark (somehow when we're talking about somewhat girly things, he's  always  added into the conversation in one way or another. It's  really  creepy, in the sense that it's starting a nuclear shwan war...don't ask) would practically  worship  these skants or pirts and possibly sacrifice himself to Lord Bun-Wah for them then Lindsay's like "Yeah...one size fits all. Because they're made of SPAAANDEX!" "and CAAAANDY!" Yeah...that's a really,  really  long story, so...don't ask.  Anywho, today was relatively boring because I was too lazy to phone a million people asking them to do something. But. I did go driving today. 3 times. The first time I did...oh my it was so bad. We were like at the parking lot at Superstore (the part that's kinda to the side and no one generally parks in it) and I was just driving around aimlessly then I didn't realize it (well I did, but I didn't...it's confusing), but I was about to enter into the part of the parking lot that was busy, and my dad's like, "What are you doing? You're not ready to drive in traffic" or something to that effect. So I was kinda pissed off, because I had to back up, then he's like bitching at me, "You're not watching if anything's behind you!" and general shit like that, so by now I'm  really  pissed off and I go to park it, but I'm not thinking straight and I put it in park before the truck was completely stopped. Anyway, it made this rank ass tapping noise (it was so brutal) and my dad's like "What the fuck are you doing?! You hear that noise?! That's you tearing the shit out of my transmission!!!" He was  so  mad at me. Oh well though. What did he honestly expect? I did nothing but slack off in the driving class and I started out driving his obeasty fucking truck, and I couldn't even see what was behind me because he has one of those truckbox thingers and it was all fogged up cuz it was raining. And then the other 2 times I was with my mom and her car, which was  so  much easier. But she is  so  annoying. I can't even begin to describe how annoying she is to drive with. I wanted to  kill  her with a pair of tweezers and feed her rotting remains to Snowball. The entire time she was like "Don't forget your signals! SLOW DOWN! You didn't signal. Watch the fucking curb! Watch out for the glass and garbage on the ground!" Ahh it was so annoying. Ohh well.  But yeah I've evidently run out of things to say, so I'm gonna bail...   -Joebie
