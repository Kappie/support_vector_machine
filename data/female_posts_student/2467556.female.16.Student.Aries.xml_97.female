We were doing this video scavenger hunt and stuff and now i will give you the play by play of how i met 2 of the Dallas Stars!!!:  Brittnee: hey look cute guys, lets go talk to them and ask them to do something stupid! Everyone: ok! Brittnee: *walks up to guys* Hey its my birthday blah blah blah...... Me: Hey wait a minute! You're Antti Miettinen!!! Antti: *smiles* Yeah i am. Me: You play for the Dallas Stars! Antti: Yes, i do. Me: Omg, my friend thinks you're so awesome!  You're her fave hockey player! Antti: Oh thats cool Me: *turns to guy thats grinning at me* And you're Mattias Tjarnqvist! Mattias: *smiles* I am. Me: Wow this is so awesome! You guys are both so great! Everyone else: Who are these people!!?! Me: *explains who they are* Antti: So you're a hockey fan? Me: Yeah Everyone: don't even get her started.... Me: *turns to Mattias* Can i shake your hand? Mattias: Yeah sure....*gives me this weak handshake but smiles anyways* Me: *turns to Antti* Can i shake your hand too? Antti: Sure, of course! *shakes my hand with strong handshake and smiles* Me: *thinking "omg you're so hot..."* Other guys with Antti and Mattias: ok we have to go..... Antti: bye! Mattias: *waves*  Brittnee got all pissed off/irritated because she said that i scared them away except i don't think she heard me when i tried to tell her that a) they don't speak english, b) they're foreign and c) they're shy and those are most of the reasons why they wouldn't do what she wanted them to do on camera.  She also didn't really hear me when i tried to tell her that they were developing players and they weren't famous or anything.  I'm just a huge stars fan and thats how i know who they are.  So while Britt was all irritated or whatever, everyone else told me to forget it because it wasn't that big of a deal.  So whatever, i got to meet 2 Dallas Stars that were really hot!!!  So i got my license yesterday too.  I've been driving all over the place now!!  Its so awesome.  I've had my license for not even 2 days now and i've:  * done 4 illegal U-turns * went at least 20 mph over the speed limit (Its Jessica's fault because she's bad at lying! lol) * Backed into a mailbox (Nadia, who put that mailbox right by your house!?!  Thats a stupid place for a mailbox!  thank god that my dad has that spare tire on that back or the car would've been screwed!) * broken at least 10 traffic laws  oh yes, so much fun having your license......aah the memories already.  Now Nathaniel wants me to give him a ride so he can see how good i am at driving.....except he's probably going to make fun of me then entire time for backing into that mailbox within my first hour of having my license and speeding really bad within the first 2 hrs.  And then he'll probably purposely run me into a mailbox JUST so he can laugh at me.  Lol jk, Nathaniel would never do that.  Yeah so my reasearch paper is finished!!!  Thank god!!!  Now i can finally NOT do hw period.  Gotta go!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
