[-i really dun blame my senior at all- it was alrite]  yelin was SiCK. imean really sick....she was lyk so pale lo whn i saw her. DO NOT EVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS cover, daria, lynette, lea... dey are actualy NICe people. dey were really serious in work and quite considerate and helpful ba. hmm, great to know em in guides.  woo... i stepped into the artrm and met mr hoHoHO...  he was lyk kept saying my artpiece didn't hav 4 and 5 values. HE IS A RACIST! he kept reminding me tt indians hav white teeth coz they are BLACK.omg, when i amended my artpiece wif his famous DERWENT pencils, he was still chit chatting wif his girlfrens. omg>>  yea... i was totally FREAKED OUT whn bennett wrote PLS DO NOT TREAT TIS ROOM AS UR NP RM... oh, why sum seniors can put deir uniforms dere, for eg, NCC, scouts??? haiz, seniors just dun really respect us anymore. RESPECT?! we hav to show em respect but dey did not show as respect? wut is tis...  hopE ThingS may work out..... - wun be blogging so often liaoz.
