WEll anyway Paul came round this morning and we chilled and listened to music, then I went to work and got myself covered in bathroom sealant, then I came home to change before the rehersal, and was feeling quite ill too, now I feel even worse, and I'm going back to bed cos my head is spinning. Have a very nice holiday Jackie, to Tom and Nicki- See you 8am Sunday, to Max, um, hello?!
