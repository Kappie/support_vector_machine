Im 16 and seeing my frens up there takin their O's later tis yr.. it realli saddens me that i cant be there to graduate together.but i feel quite proud that i noe these ppl and i feel so happy for them..well..back to myself.  Im in a family of 6..im the third child out of 4.I have an older bro,he's 22 i tink and is currently serving his NS and my older sis hus 20 is in NUS..yeah,she's damn bloody clever bt sometimes i tink she's stupid,when it cums to choosing boyfriends.Im not gonna go into that.All i can say is that I dun LiKE her boyfriend!okay..moving on..My younger sis is onli 12..and taking her PSLE later tis yr..She better not slack and go into my bloody school..I'll screw her if that happens.My mom is one of the ppl i love in the world.Of cos,she gave birth to me.And i appreciate her for everything she has done 4 me.She has done alot for me.Im not good in showing my love,but if she ever comes across this blog of mine,i hope she noes how much i really love her despite giving her hard times and rocky turbulences in our family the last 2 yrs.That brings me to my father.He loves me in his own way,that i know and i love him too.I love him so much now bt yeah..I cant seem to express my love to my family tt easy.Bottomline: Im a i-love-my-family girl.  Yet,im so stubborn.And naive.And emotional.And bloody noisy.And egoistic.U'll tend to noe more abt me in times to come..
