DAD: They used to use electricity to get rid of bank robbers. They called it "Old Smokey". PHILEDA: That's kind of sad, imagine saying 'She died by old smokey'. MOM: Well... DAD: The electric chair isn't used any more, probably for that reason. ELISE: Do they let them go after they get electrocuted?  Sadness....... lol. Yup, we were like, "Uhh, yah, they let them go."  So anyway, what do you do when you can't figure out what you want, if you want the person you think you want, and what they want is completely unknown to you? God I'm so confused right now.   Libra     Lazing around the living room with your feet kicked up may sound like as much fun as hanging out with a crowd today. Don't feel guilty if you spend the whole day doing nothing at all.    No problem. lol. Today I woke up late, like at 12:00. I had a headache, ahem. I had stayed up until like 2:00 thinking though. Very confused but I think I have a sort of decision. I think everyone will like it. Lol, read posts below were I say I'm not going to make any decisions. Ah ha. Like that lasted very long. That shows what my will power is. About NOTHING.  Well I luv All u guys,  ~*Phileda*~
