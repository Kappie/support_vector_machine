I FOUND IT w00t  Haha yes, I have located the elusive camp somehow...I was able to find an article about the sponsoring of the camp, which in turn lead me to finding the name of the camp grounds, which in turn I got directions and thusly a map to. It's...damn. It's out in the boonies. Right on the line to Dickson, on the Cheatham line...not too hard to find.  Ok, so it exists...hard to believe, but yes.
