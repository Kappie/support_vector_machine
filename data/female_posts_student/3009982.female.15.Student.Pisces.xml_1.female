HAVOC. ok let me see, Monday morning- i woke up late, barely had time to bathe and dress. then all the projects have been piling up and more homework is on the way. Tuesday- i missed the van altogether. i came down, waited for 10 mins and was wondering why my neighbours who took the same van werent outside waiting. doh'. then i realized i had missed it. doh' doh' doh'. the reason why i was late and didnt realize was becos i usually set my bedroom clock a lil faster. but that day, my mom set it back to normal time, she didnt know. and so tada, the van driver left without me, thinking i wasnt going to school. Today, was Wednesday, i did the probably dumbest thing of my life ever.  You see, since i missed the van yesterday, decided not to take any chances and so i set the clock early. when i woke up, realized i was nearly late AGAIN, rushed to washup and bathe.. rushed down the stairs and waited for the bus. this time i was very sure i didnt miss it.. but after waiting 20 mins, the van still had not arrived! and my neighbours were still not in sight. Doh'. i had missed it AGAIN??   so we got into the car and my mom started the engine, and LO AND BEHOLD, the car clock said 5.50 AM! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I had gotten up 1 hour early and i didnt even realize it. ohmygoodness, i feel so stupid and dumb and daft and blunt and idiotic.   well, thats the mornings of mary-ruth, recounted for you.  i bet you dont want to know what goes on in the afternoons and evenings. so, later.  cheers, m-r 21.47 hours, 14 April 2004
