A nap sounded nice too, but heh that did work either.. I guess cause im sick and feel like chit that its makin me not feel satisfied with anything that i do... ive been losing my appetite the past few days also.. maybe thats a good thing so that i dont pig out on junk but then its probably a bad thing cuz im not eating... i ono its a pain.... Right now im listening to a mix of Vertical Horizon, Ozzmosis, Blink 182, Oleander, and NickleBack.... then watching Lethal Weapon 2 and yeah well being online... yup im multitasking lol.. *sigh* its been a long lonely/depressing and shitting feeling day...
