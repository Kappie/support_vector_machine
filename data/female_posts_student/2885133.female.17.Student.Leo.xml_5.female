The birthday party I attended was for a six-year-old so I ended up being the unofficial babysitter/mother/sister. It was AWFUL! There is a reason why I do not ever babysit. Some people say it's a good way to earning money, but I prefer a job like research or even filing papers. For one, I can't stand insubordinate children. You ask them to do one thing and they do another. When you get strict, tears flood and I start crying too... *shudder* There were at least ten children under the age of ten. Aack! I never got to work on writing of any sort. It seems I will be busy completing an art history paper while trying to finish a chapter of biology. Oh crappie.
