Well, not necessarily a lot... just more than everyone else does.  Does this make me a bad person?  No.  Does this make the rest of SiT bloggers bad people?  Damn straight--I mean, of course not.  ;-)    Perhaps I'm just the loser with the least amount of non-virtual goings on who has the time to write on the most neglected blog of them all.  B/c she feels rotten about it... she has empathy for the poor bugger... it's not fun being ignored, especially when all the other blogs are so popular.    *tear*    Today was an interesting day, I suppose.  Went to church, ate lunch with the G-Master, went to Inga's reception, by myself nonetheless.  I trekked the trip all by myself.  I'm pretty sure 'trekked' isn't a word.  I should probably delete it.  *shifty eyes*  Yeah, I'm gonna go away now.  I understand when my presence is needed, and when it's not.  Wallpaper knows its place, Manda
