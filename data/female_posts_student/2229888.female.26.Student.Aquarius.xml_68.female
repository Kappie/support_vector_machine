Farthest Star   we'll drive to the farthest star you and I watching waves of clouds roll by losing a lonely tear to cry tip-toe on wonders in the sky  wandering milky paths criss-crossed space we'll flee to darkest ebony place midnight horses setting pace laughing at the moon's bright face  we'll wake and dream without seam we'll cry and sigh while rivers dry we'll growl and quake for nothing's sake we'll glow then dim 'til dawn light's brim  fly fly fly goodbye bye bye
