This is nice as I was not too excited about having to pack up all my crap. I really love the area and I know without a doubt I wasn't going to find anything comparable to where I'm living, especially for the amount I wanted to pay. For some reason, my overly gracious mother rationalized she would rather help me out with the difference, since I will be unemployed, than have me move. I won't complain. I'd be sad to move. Plus I've noticed a plethora of hot babes in the building lately. Particularly the one that lives on my floor. But.....I don't think living in the same place is the best idea. What happens if you break up? That would suck to see the ****** everyday. :)    I'm not  just  seeing the babes at my complex. I'm seeing them at the JCC too. I guess I forgot about them since I haven't been in awhile. It made me feel especially good when I was approached by someguys at the gym and asked why I hadn't been in awhile. What could be better than for a guy to be hot, wealthy, and Jewish? My dad sure wouldn't complain. Not that I care about the Jewish part. But hot  and  wealthy is always an added benefit! I've got those two qualities down between the JCC and my complex.    So  of course  I notice all these potentials when I have no desire to be involved with anyone. That's how life works though, right? I'm in a good spot; not yearning for anything in my past and not worrying about what I want in the future. I'm happy. It's good to be Rebecca Holtzman! I feel like I have everything I need and everything I want. For today anyway. Ask again tomorrow. There is this skirt I want.
