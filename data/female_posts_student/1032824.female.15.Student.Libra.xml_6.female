I was really upset when i found out that there was a 3rd day for the course.  the test . honestly, i would rather go to the kayaking course. * tsssssk . really extremely confused cos i don't know what to do.. until  fungi kor  suggested something.. felt relieved afterwhich.  however ,  mr lau  later sms-ed and said that the test would end at 10am, when my kayaking course starts at 10am too. and it takes like 1 hour to get there by taxi i think. * sighs . geeeshhh okay wanna go polish my boots oredi. ciao friends! =) *huggles*  And  welcome back joanne!  haha. =)
