Mary came down, so i'm having fun chilling with her. and i have a new guilty pleasure: Christina Aguilera. but who doesn't secretly love her? anyway, today was a lot of fun. i love my family so much, you know, they're just so cool to hang out with. tonight, my dad, my aunt, mary and i went to go see "wes craven presents: they" and i hated it because the ending was so... sudden and stuff. but today was fun, so i'm happy. i've gotten lots of hugs, and hugs make me happy, and i've gotten lots of just... fun stuff. and stuff. i don't know. anyway, go out and buy christina's stripped because its the best and its so surprisingly good, so someone PLEASE  please PLEASE  get me that CD. i've got to go Jules
