Got a new CS clan (EN - Endless Nights) they are alot of fun, Dave is almost like a second father lol. We've been doing more scrims and are enter cal-O sometime this month :) it'll be cool to see where this goes, though I'm going to have to find a way to convince my dad that I have to play....that'll be tough seeing as he still is restricting me from the computer occasionaly. There's alot to work on, but it'll all get done in time.  Planing to go see Ally over the 4th of July, that'll be fun :D then Jordan and Anton want me to stop by them in Chicago...yeah right lol...that's a little far away, but we'll see. Might be cool to go site seeing for once. So yeah, that's all I really have time for, gotta finish a movie :)
