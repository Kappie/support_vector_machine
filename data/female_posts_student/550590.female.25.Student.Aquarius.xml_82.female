The call from Connecticut never came, and I went to Chilis to hang out with Christy et al. for the first time in what seems like FOREVER.  All of what remains of our little happy hour group is graduating in May which means there will be less happy hour times to be had in the future which makes me...more un-happy than usual.  Tonight one person in particular was being a little more flirty than usual until Jason called him on it which seemed to cause him to cuddle up to JAson instead.  :(  I must clarify that this is not the Jason who left work before 3 o'clock today, but rather the Jason that is Christy's wonderful and annoyingly perfect boyfriend.  Tomorrow it's off to Alligator Rocks for a much-needed night of debauchery.  All I can say--it's about damn time!  I intend to get well lubricated--liquored up you sickos--so that I can spend the rest of the week stressed out beyond belief.  Despite the upcoming stress, however, I'm really looking forward to dinner with some of my favorite men in the whole world next Friday night.  0= )
