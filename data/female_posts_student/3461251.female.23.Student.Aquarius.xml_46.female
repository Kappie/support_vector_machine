I finally had the talk with Josh and to my surprise, which I sorta knew deep inside - He thinks we're only friends, that's all we've ever been, even after I sleep with him!  I can't help but to feel used though!  He knew that I was never into being friends with someone and having extra benefits.  I've told him that from the start of our friendship but I guess it's funny how guys remember what they want and forget everything else.   Anyways, now I need to decide if I want to keep being 'just friends' or just move on with my life and forget it.  I mean is the friendship that good? If it was, would he of done this to me?   But the main thing that really gets me is - When we met, I was really shy with him but he keep trying to get me out of it, which finally happened and we sleep together.  However, if he just wanted to be friends - why the hell did he work so hard?   Blah.  I'll figure it all out soon enough but for now I'm keeping my distance and if he wants to stay friends, he'll just have to prove himself.  I don't think I'm asking for to much there! :-)  However, on a good note!  I love my life right now! I'm happy with the way things are going, I'm even happier that I'm more active then I've ever been, and the best part - I'll be returning to school in the fall to finish my college degree then I'll be able to move on with my life.  And who knows where that will take me but I think good things will sooner or later come!   On another good note - One of my cute dresses in my closet FITS! It use to be so tight before surgery and now I can wear it again! Oh I'm so happy and I look cute! Hehe! :-)
