Bucky was not an ordinary squirrel, he had the misfortune of being raised by a pack of wild pigeons. However, Bucky has overcome his obvious pratfalls by learning to be a messenger squirrel. Bucky currently works for the Pigeon Express earning menial wages. (I wrote this one..)  Bucky's life long dream was to become a New York pigeon. Ever since the beginnings of the Pigeon Express he tried but always failed to be a pigeon. One day Bucky ran into the oldest, wisest, and most trusted (*drum roll*) grasshopper, Kanga Roo Jack. Now Kanga had the best plan for Bucky-- Since Bucky was always in trouble and was often called a klutz Mr. Roo told Bucky to travel to the other side of the moon and recollect all memories of lost treasure recovering green bean casserole. One thing about Kanga Roo Jack-- he has little memory and makes no sense when he talks. But that doesn't stop Bucky from traveling to the other side of the moon and recollect all memories of lost treasure recovering green bean casserole.

Now, you may be thinking, "Nair??". Yes, Nair. It has been proven that nair, in shot glass amounts has the same affect as alcohol does. The only extra side effect is massive hair loss. This may be the reason why Bucky is experiencing squirrel pattern baldness at such a young age. This may be an advantage for Bucky, seeing as the best-looking pigeons are the hairless ones. (>Yep I wrote this)   Bucky notices his hair loss and at first is in extreme drunken shock, but after a while (although he loved his fur very much) he decided if he was ever gonna be a New York pigeon, he was gonna have to be bald. Taking Kanga's offer he goes to the Moon and notices that well there's no gravity. The now Bouncy Bald Bucky floats around looking for the casserole and after plenty of looking his space ship runs out of gas. After realizing he only has enough food for 2 weeks and no gas reserves or phone, he gives up his dream of being a New...York...Pigeon. WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, A METEORITE starts going straight towards the earth! Bouncy bald bucky gets an insane idea to jump on and make it back to earth. He crash lands in Africa where the native pigeons confuse him for their King. (this was by urlLink  Josh )  Because of the extreme impact of the spaceship to the ground, Bucky is experiencing a slight case of amnesia. In a last-stitch effort to regain all remembrance of his past, Bucky goes to visit the local knowledge Pigeon, who is really a slightly confused sparrow. "O Knowledge Pigeon, tell me who I am," pleads our buck-toothed friend. The Knowledge pigeon, who is really Sir Sparrow, tells bucky that he is the great one who fell from the sky. "I fell from the sky?" asks Bucky. "Yes," replies the Knowledge Pigeon. Although the Knowledge Pigeon isn't really a pigeon, he still knows everything there is to know, and Bucky realizing this fact, asks Sir Sparrow to become his mentor. Sir Sparrow accepts Bucky's invitation because of his secret desire to be just like Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid movies. (Yep, another beautiful paragraph by, me.)  Sir Sparrow and Bucky begin training right away.  Mrs. Sparrow, Sir Sparrow's mommy, and also a chef, serves them everyday after training.  And everyday its always this dish, best described as stuff.  After a few weeks of training Bucky begins to wonder what exactly it is he's eating so he asks.  Mrs. Sparrow informs him that it's a recipe that's been in the family for years, back from when her great-great-great-great-grand-sparrow used to live on the moon.  "I call it green bean casserole".  Bucky can't believe his luck..  Bucky's Lucky!! The next day during his training he can hardly concentrate "I could get Mrs. Sparrow to make some of this stuff and I could take it back to Mr.Roo. He's ancient and he cant remember much anyway, the old kook wont be able to tell the difference.  Besides, its a genuine recipe, it came from moon-inhabitants."  are the thoughts that fill his mind.
