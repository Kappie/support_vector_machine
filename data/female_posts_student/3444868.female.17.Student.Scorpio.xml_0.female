It's really depressing, but I'm not ready to drive.  My dad thinks something is wrong with me.  He thinks I'm scared, but I'm not scared of driving.  However, I just realized recently the truth in what he said.  I'm not scared of driving, but I'm so scared of growing up.  I don't feel old enough or ready to grow up.  Growing up means responsibly and making choices about my life that I'm not ready to make.  Driving for me is a major step in my life that means I'm one more step to independence.  Every year on my birthday I think I'll magically feel grown up.  It has yet to happen.  So yes dad I'm scared, but I'm scared of growing up, not driving.  Those are my depressing thoughts of the day.  I'm also afraid of what a idiot I'll look like going to get my permit renewed for the second time.  I just need to grow up whether I want to or not, but it's so hard.
