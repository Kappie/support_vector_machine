For instance, the only folders that had binder holes in them were ones with really stupid pictures and plain ones that only came in about three colors. Yeah, I'm one of those crazy people who like to organize all of their stuff by color... So that worked out pretty crappy. But it's not like it really matters.  The only messenger bags they had at Target were an olive green canvas one and a blue one which was pretty ugly. I got the green one, which I really do like, only it's a little small. But it is more or less what I wanted. I'm just afraid that when I get more stuff in my trapper and my bag that things won't fit well at all.  Hm. Time to stop thinking about school.  Unfortunately, I haven't got much else to think about. So I guess it's goodnight.
