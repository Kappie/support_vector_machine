(ty!) i have been so stressed and emo lately, i cant wait till its over! these past couple of weeks have had their ups and downs, as does life in general... it will be okay... i have a lot of love and support from a lot of different people and i love all of you who have helped. thanks a bunch :-* hugs and kisses... anyway, i gotta go get ready for the concert... love always ~Nikki~
