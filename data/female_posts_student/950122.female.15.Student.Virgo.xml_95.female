Before we actually went to the memorial, they showed us this video clip/short documentary about the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was so sad to watch. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of an attack like that. The thought scares me.  Recently I went to Borders! Borders is a bookstore here, and it's paradise. Soo many good books to read, and they don't mind if you get a book and plop yourself down on the floor somewhere. I could stay there for a day and be happy. *daydreams*  I'm coming home on wednesday. I have a lot to catch up on.
