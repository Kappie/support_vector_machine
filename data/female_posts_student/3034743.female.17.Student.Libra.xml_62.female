Tonight Amanda, Alex, and Holli came over for movie night. We watched the movie Grind. It was pretty funny. There was this character in there named Matt, and he totally reminded me of Matt Belding. It was funny. ADAM BRODY was in it!!!! SCORE!!!! I know Amanda has taken a new quote from that movie! (greetings from the interior)haha. good stuff. well that was basically it for today!
