My mother emailed me on Saturday morning to tell me that my Great-grandmother - everyone called her Mammy - had died.  The news has saddened me, though not for the usual reasons.  It is sad that she is gone, but she did lead a full and meaningful life, which is more than any of us can ask, and she didn't die in any pain, she just gradually faded over the course of the week and slipped away from this world sometime in her sleep.  What grieves me the most is that she lived so long and saw so much - she was 100 years old - and yet I never appreciated that fact, and how much she could teach me about the world as it was and as it is.  It is rare to meet a person who has lived through so much...even now that people are living longer, it is still a somewhat rare occurrence to meet someone who lived so long as her.  There are so many things she must have seen or been a part of or been affected by, from the great historical events from last century that are just pages in a book or images from the past to me to the mundane and personal family traumas and triumphs that now exist only as stories from people who weren't there or are too young to remember.  Other memories are locked tightly away in her mind.  In recent years, it might have been difficult to extract such information from her - she was still as alert as possible, but hard of hearing and slightly forgetful.  But when I would visit her, she would always, after a second, upon prodding, remember who I was.  And that is what is sad, for I don't have the capability of remembering who she is, because I never really knew.  And I could kick myself for not being more curious about her when I was younger, when I could have gotten her unclouded perspective on things.  Someone very wise once chastised me for not knowing more about the past of my family and its individual members.  I didn't listen, so it is too late for my Great-grandmother.  But it is not too late for my grandparents, at least the ones that are left.  And the next chance I get, you can bet I will extract from them all the knowledge and remembrance that I can.  I will not tune out my Grandfather's military stories, or my Grandmothers memories of her childhood in Mississippi.  I will listen, I will be curious and ask questions to elicit even more information than is offered, and I will learn, before all of it is gone forever.
