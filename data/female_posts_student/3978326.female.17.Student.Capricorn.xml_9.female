Situated at the 1 st floor, it was a place where functions were held. As it was a multi-purpose building, it was currently in use for examinations. Upon further enquiries, it turned out that the students enrolled in the Centre for Pre-University Studies were having their term and also trials for the upcoming Cambridge A-Levels examination. Consequently, or maybe not, high levels of abnormality was recorded in our electromagnetic wave device. We then went closer, for a through examination of the events ongoing while the students sweated out in the dark, unfriendly atmosphere...  "That teacher was born and raised in hell!! "Precisely, how are we suppose to complete a paper with 2 hours worth of question within an hour?" ....."I couldn't finish that #$*%ing paper!" "She purposely did it....remember what she said..."I would give you 2 long questions where you have to balance accounts with no objective questions...how's that? It would be easy! " "Those accounts couldn't be balanced....I'm going to fail it...." "Oh screw it man!"  Not far away, we heard another group of students..  "Sir, there's no time. How can you do this sir?! "Was it hard?" "No, in can be done, but, there was NO TIME!" "Sir,....our grades, 100% from this paper?" "Yah..." "NO, sir....NO!" And with a sly smile, he said, "Just take this as an experience, go back home and try it out again...we will see how...this paper...." and left, with the doors swinging back. "How could he do this, I DIDN'T complete so many questions!"   In another case,  "I'm so tense, how the hell am I suppose to hold this up? I missed an exam because of some time table mix-up. Ms(--) told me that this paper would be now, but when I went there, the place was empty", "Oh, another classic case of teachers from hell..." "NO...SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED IN HELL!" "You should calm down, you got another test in 10 minutes..." "Gosh! I'm so dead man, so DEAD!"     Point  : It is rather interesting how much of pain those 'creatures from hell' can incure to these students. If they were truly from hell, wounldn't they carry and emblem of some kind, like two horns, projecting upwards like the rather over-americanized devil - Hell Boy? Incognitos had many reasons to believe that these 'creatures' had been suited with many disguises....then again....maybe not...      Sighting 4 : Zombies.    Many complained of being dead and only present in a vaguest way possible. Incognitos found this an interesting fact. In many conversations that we overheard, many references were made about death and the cycle of life, in rather interesting ways. For example :   1) I booked the incinerator last week and decided to keep my date with it after physics paper. 2) What are you guys talking about?..huh..amoebic movement...multinucleic? I'm in the    twilight zone right now.... 3) Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder how close you are... 4) I am so dead,I'm twelve feet underneath.. 5) I would be lucky if I could see the day light 6) -I am dead -If you're dead, I'm already eaten and digested by animals -And through amonification, I'm already a nitrate -You can't beat this! I'm denitrified and already in the air as N2 (nitrogen gas)      Point  : The students still managed humour although they claimed to be dead. Are zombies     capable of human emotions while facing physical erosion?
