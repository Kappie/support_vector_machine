I bought my mom a sweater and a rad little stuffed giraffe for Hannah. Andrew got the same one, and is all mad at me, but he won't ever see it unless he decides to hang out with my little sister.  weird.  but i don't think that'll ever happen. She decided to stay another week in pendleton, so I can't drive over and see her and bring her home, sad... so now I wait until Thursday.
