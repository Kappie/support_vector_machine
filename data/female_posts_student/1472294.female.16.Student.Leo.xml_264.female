This Princess Diane's is an illustration website, I accidentally clicked on the link, of course stupidly thought that it would be about THE Princess Diane... But her website was filled with sweet, sweet and cute pictures of a little girl she drew. Very kawaii! I always have a thing for this kind of cute, cute stuff although I admit I don't look like one who will carry cute key chains or draw these icons. That's really not me. But I love the little girl and the hostess's love for everything. But a caution for non-chinese browers, you must download a chinese sofeware, if not you can't really read what exactly is going on. But her icons are in English, so it is easy to browse. *Running off to check on my more websites...*
