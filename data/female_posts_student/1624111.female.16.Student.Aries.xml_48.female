OptiMist 23 6: i dunno  Auto response from yellowfuzz13: "The most I can do for my friend is simply to be his friend." -Henry David Thoreau  yellowfuzz13: er, sorry OptiMist 23 6: ok.... OptiMist 23 6: whose friend? OptiMist 23 6: ur friend's firend? yellowfuzz13: my friend yellowfuzz13: any friend OptiMist 23 6: ok OptiMist 23 6: how can u be a friend tho OptiMist 23 6: what defines being a friend? yellowfuzz13: lots of things OptiMist 23 6: such as/// yellowfuzz13: i suppose loving someone so much as to want to offer them anything you have to give if they should need it, not expecting or desiring recompensation OptiMist 23 6: wow OptiMist 23 6: ok OptiMist 23 6: there go a lot of my friends... OptiMist 23 6: they at least want friendship in return OptiMist 23 6: :-) as do i OptiMist 23 6: i'd say OptiMist 23 6: ... yellowfuzz13: see, thats the thing... i mean, i think that, but then i think "is it so much to want time with someone? to want to be with them? talking to them? that is not asking for anything beyond what is expected of a friend, is it?" but then... i dunno. its not unreasonable to want that, of course, friends see each other. friends talk. right? however...its better to think about it like...its not about caring about each other equally and being as good a friend as the other person or whatever... if you love the person, then you give them all you have to offer.  i think it is better to have the attitude--especially if you feel like maybe youre not seeing someone enough or losing them or wahtever--of, like, "this is what i promise i will do for you whenever you want me to. i dont know how much you care about me, but it doesnt make a difference, i'm here should you want anything." ...i dunno. something like that. OptiMist 23 6: that's wonderful yellowfuzz13: because love, real love anyway, is always selfless.  aw, me on friends...
