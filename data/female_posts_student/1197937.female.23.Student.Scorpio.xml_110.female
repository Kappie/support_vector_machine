'splurge' happens.   apparently, it's also my muse. i figured out exactly what i'm going to write for my personal statement. just a little bit of research and i should be well on my way and done by the end of this week. hurray!   this is a miracle considering how i read every single essay in princeton review's "law school essays that made a difference." can i just say, BIG MISTAKE?? seriously, ppl could get writer's block for life from reading that thing. there are way too many overaccomplished ppl in this world. i will get down on my knees and kiss the ground if i make it to ANY law school. or as i promised a friend, i will donate my entire wardrobe to unicef, sin recent purchases.  don't ever hold me to anything i say. arnold is growing on me already.
