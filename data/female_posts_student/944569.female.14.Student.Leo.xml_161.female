I especially hate fics centered on them...IN PRINCE OF TENNIS. omg, you won't believe how many MS are running amok in the PoT fandom.  I found a particularly HORRIBLE story on ff.net today.  *shudders* Left an extremely long ass review to make sure the writer NEVER does that again.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Sakura *snort* it's a rip off Sakuno.  Who's that person?  In her profile it said Tomo and Sakuno dont fit Ryoma and that her silly little Mary Sue named Sakura is better because she's better than Tezuka in tennis, best friends with Ryoma and is extremely pretty, is a prodigy.  HELLOOO!  That's so perfect that it makes me want to puke.
