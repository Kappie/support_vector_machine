"It's the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next month, and next year --- and to explain afterward why it didn't happen." ~Sir Winston Churchill    I have no choice but to share my thoughts on the California Governor problems.  I am from California, born and raised, and I moved to Texas in June of 1999.  I am glad I did.  I would seem that in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor, along with him, Larry Flint –Hustler Porn King- is also running.  I would hate to be a resident of California right now!  How could someone like Larry Flint even be considered for governor in California?  Who would vote for him?  I certainly would not.  I don’t believe I would vote for Arnold either.  Yet I wonder what real chance there is to choose, Larry Flint would definitely be a far worse choice than Arnold would, but by how much?    Take for instance Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is running on the Republican ticket, yet he is married to a Kennedy –who are known for being flaming liberals!  So by this evidence, it doesn’t matter what ticket he runs on, he’s in bed with the Kennedy’s!  He goes on TV and says he will not take campaign contributions and turns around in the same sentence and says that his promoters are planning fund-raisers for him.  Someone should tell the man that fund-raisers are accepting campaign contributions.  He is an actor, he oversteps his boundary.    LARRY FLINT!  Who in the hell would vote for Larry Flint?  What would his campaign promise be “Two whores for every house!”?  What skill does the man have that would qualify him for such a position, other than a big mouth and a perverted mind?    To say there very least, Californians are in a touch spot right now, thank god I am not one of them!  ~Kristyn
