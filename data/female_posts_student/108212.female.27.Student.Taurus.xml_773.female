I think it's Pacino) are brilliant in this early 70's masterpiece of the "gritty realism" psychodrama genre.  Some icky moments, especially a prison-attempted-rape-scene, but worth it.  Don't think I've seen it since its theater release 30 years ago, though - I'll have to remedy that.  Watched  Monsters, Inc.  on DVD this weekend - much better than its reviews.  Captivating story, and very good job of creating a fantasy universe that explains our own "observed" interactions with monsters (kids' closets, Loch Ness sightings), without being too grownup about it.
