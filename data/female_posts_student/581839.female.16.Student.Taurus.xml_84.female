It is fine here, it's just that on that particular day, i was really missing some of the places that i've visited. Dude, i just don't think that Texas has much culture compaired to some of the other places i've visited. i've looked all through dallas, and all through fort worth, and i don't find anything that APPEALS to me. don't jump to conclusions about things that you don't know the complete answer to. i think that sometimes girls dress up too much, and show off too much, when they are young. i just didn't like that. and that other person you don't have to care. i just talk to you like your my diary, so if this is the way that it's going to be about this other person. than i'll just stop talking about it all together. and also, you've never seen me around this other person, so how would you know, and call me a hypocriteok? i was depressed that day. big deal. sometimes, its human to have MOOD SWINGS. earth to brent, i don't think that you get what i was saying. you do have mood swings, and often, no offense. but i only have these "depressed" mood swings once in a while. for petes sake child, i was JUST DEPRESSED. deal with it. i've been hanging around down people all week, and that is why i came to school quiet and tired. antoinette and caroline re-powered me, and thats why i was hanging around them. sometimes, you've just got to let go, and get a break. do you understand now? Mary, what is a word that rhymes with, speghetti. ask your italian friends, they'll know. i'm triying to post a blog that i made on saturday, but it's not working right now. it is really weird, and very critizising, especially to mary, but i was just venting and trying to deal with the fact about mary changing and going to college. anyway, i have to go, because i'm at school. Jules
