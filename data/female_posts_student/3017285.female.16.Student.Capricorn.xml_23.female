I COMMAND YOU!!!  .......pweeeeese? *puppy dog eyes* I feel all lonely......      -----------  AAAAnyway, what happened today....  Ms. Grieble unwittingly quoted a bit from my essay in english class today.  Well, she knew it was from an essay, but not from whos. Uh-huh, go me! go me!    And Aram distributed free candy so we'd vote him president. mmmm, candy........ ^_^ I *like* being bribed
