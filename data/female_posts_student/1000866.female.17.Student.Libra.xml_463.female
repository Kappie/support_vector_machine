Talking to Bryan definitely put me in a better mood though. :) I think I somehow like him more everytime i talk to him. I mean...I like him...a...hmm, I'm trying to think of a phrase that doesn't have a swear in it..a heck of a lot, so..it's hard to believe I can like him more every time I talk to him. Not that I'm objecting or anything... :) I just hope he still likes me as much. I'm so paranoid. Heh.  I think I'm going to go sleep now or something.
