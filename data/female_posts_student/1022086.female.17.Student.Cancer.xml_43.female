I slept very little this week, and no one's left me alone for a freaking second when I needed to be alone (save for the Chemsitry all-nighter I pulled). I suppose I could sum things up a bit.  a) The County Honor Choir rather sucks. I don't really like the music too much, and we don't seem to have too many great participants. Eh.   b) Took ChemOlympiad test today. Likely bombed it.   The food was good, though! =-D  c) Asia is pissing me off. A lot. She's very mean still, and she's tearing up the house and attacking Shah. I don't know what to do.   d) All State is tomorrow. I'm scared. My audition is at 10.50 am. Moo...  e) I feel like crap, and I'm tired. Life seems so empty and lonely lately, and I'm hating it.  f) Side, non related note: over time this semester (or maybe this year, in general), I have learned to appreciate some people that I was previously very closed-minded about. I feel like a real jerk for thinking so badly of them now that I have made up my mind that they aren't such bad/snooty/detestable people after all.    All right, there was my update. Sorry for no more and no happier, but I suppose that such things happen.   Adios, amigos/amigas.   "Let that Be Enough"  by Switchfoot   I wish I had what I needed  To be on my own  'Cause I feel so defeated  And I'm feeling alone   And it all seems so helpless  And I have no plans  I'm a plane in the sunset  With nowhere to land   And all I see  It could never make me happy  And all my sand castles  Spend their time collapsing   Let me know that You hear me  Let me know Your touch  Let me know that You love me  Let that be enough   It's my birthday tomorrow No one here could know  I was born this Thursday  22 years ago   And I feel stuck  Watching history repeating  Yeah, who am I?  Just a kid who knows he's needy   Let me know that You hear me  Let me know Your touch  Let me know that You love me  And let that be enough
