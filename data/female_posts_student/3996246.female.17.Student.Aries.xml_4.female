He thought I was mad at him, so he didn't speak to me, and I thought he was mad at me, so I didn't speak to him. I cleared it all up at the end of my shift and everything's cool now  Everytime I get stressed out I get really bad pains in my stomach like my stomach is eating itself. It lasts for about 45 minutes to an hour and then it usually goes away. Today at work it was really busy and I was working with all new people, I was getting really frustrated and I started the pains. I went on my break and I couldn't eat so I just sat there with my head down for 15 minutes. Lynn suggested that it might just be dehydration, so I drank a few bottles of water and it didn't help. I took some pills, it didn't help. The muggy weather is really bothering my knees as well, I already have bad cartlage in my knees and during certain weather-types I experiance more pain than usual in them.  I really am a hurting unit.  Work again tomorrow, 11:30-8. Ashley is working until 8 too, so after work we are heading down to the North End to see Xiu Xiu. It should be a good show.
