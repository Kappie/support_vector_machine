Cuz I felt pretty dumb today. yeah. The highlight was Sara's weirdohead card thing. Haha. I'm marrying the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES- Eric Meland. Hahahaha. I kill Aaron, Marc is a hippie/ fashion designer, and NIck marries britney spears and lives on the streets.  Haha.  That was quiittee amusing. But, sara and I forgot to meet all of our people! Like the kid who loooks like Emily and the kid with cool hair...sad times.  After school I ate 4 popsicles (they momentarily remove my pain!) and took a shower. Then I went to tennis! It was SO fun! Everyone was being super nice to me for some reason..I got to play singles! It was crazy weird! but I still won! Wahhoo!!! Now, my rating is POSITIVE! I have won more than I lost! YES! Happy days! These days are ouuurrrs, HAPPY AND FREE! These days are ouuurss, come share them with ME!  Then I went to Katies house...that was interesting in a very scary way. Heather and Johanna had to leave early so it was just me, Kaite, Garrett, and Nick...I was like alrighty...this is akward. her mom cooked really good mexican food! It was tastyy. Then she gave us desert which was rice crispy treats, or as garrett calls them "KRISPY KREMESS!" yeah..  Then we watched this weirdo movie called "Hangmans curse" it was..interesting. Verrrry creepy...in a funny sorta way.  Now I am at home because my dad has his friends over who are missionaries in Indonesia. They are cool. I wanan be a missionary, but not in indonesia!  I am dreadfully sick...I am going to try to get super sick so I wont have to even face the world tomorrow, we will see how it goes :)
