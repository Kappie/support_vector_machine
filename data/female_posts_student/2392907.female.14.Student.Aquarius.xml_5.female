But I only had a few sprites.. ah well, sprite has the effect of ecstasy tablets on me I guess.  She drags herself out of her bed, disgusted that she hadn't changed to go to sleep the last night and is still in her mini and low low low top. She goes to shower.   Why have I got some number written on the back of my hand?  she wonders. She decides not to wash it off and carefully tries to preserve it. When she comes out, she decides to make up for last night by wearing a long sleeved shirt and the baggiest trousers she can find.  She picks up the phone and dials.  "Hello?" "Hello? Who is this?" "It's Ryan."  Oh, so  that's  who it is.  "It's Jane." "Oh hi. Hi."   What am I supposed to say now? I can't just say "Oh I just phoned to find out whose number I had on the back of my hand". I'll have to invite him somewhere or ask something. Oh God. Help.   "I erm... do you wanna, do you.. I-I.. no, I mean.."  Crap crap crap think of something.  "You wanna have coffee some time?"  Saved!  "Yeh, that would be great." "Starbucks in about an hour?" "That's good." "OK, see you then then." "Bye." Puts down phone.
