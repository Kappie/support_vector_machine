All singles are $0.99 and most albums are anywhere from $9.99 to $14.99 depending on the album.  I love this far more than buymusic.com.  The difference is the layout and since it's a downloadable program it gathers all your mp3 files and becomes it's own player and it's own cd burner as well.  Check it out and be on the lookout for the new napster coming out as well.
