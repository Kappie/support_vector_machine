She will only stay a few days a month but thanks to her I can get the place I want AND she is reliable enough that when I need to stay for school I can. I'm glad for that. So here is the good news :) Tomorrow I will go in and see about getting the place. YAY.   Today has been hectic. Tomorrow I have inspection for the house which is fine I just have a few things left to do and it will be ready. I just wish taht I had a bit of help but oh well none around. No big deal. Easier in some ways to do it myself. Though I wish to fricken hell Joey would have finished the bedroom. Oh well.   Keeping this short it's almost 11 and I"m tired. I want to do a few things in my room before I go to bed.
