I probably won't actually update it like ever... or do anything with it... but I might as well have one.. right?  Anyways... school is almost over, life is good, and I'm getting Distinguished Honors for the last quarter of 8th grade, if everything goes well that is.  That means I have gotten Honors every quarter, and I get a special star next to my name at graduation!!! Yay for me!!! Lol.  So basically... my life is boring as crap at the moment, so who gives a fuck?  Not me!  w00t w00t.  Now that you have read that pointlessness, have fun writing a comment!  ...la Gu  P.S.  And by the way, if you were wondering, the dates are in Hungarian! w00t!  Go Hungarian heritage! Lol.
