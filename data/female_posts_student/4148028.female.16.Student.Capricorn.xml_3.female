Goddamn it! i wish i knew what the fuck was going on. i trust him implicitly...but i don't know if he was really trying to make it and it didn't work out...oor if he just lied to me...but...ya know...if it's not gonna work out...he coulda let a sister know...he's supposedly driving an 18-wheeler in texas at the moment...but ya know...if he had promised me he'd be here on the 8th and he wasn't gonna make it...even if he doesn't have his cell phone anymore...every fucking corner store has a damn payphone!...but...ya know ...i guess i'll get over it...i don't have any other choice....well i'll c ya'll later.
