Obviously. =P  I love his character.  So sweet but hates to admit it, and not because of humbleness or manners but because he is one confused vamp.  Haha  NOTE: No need to say so, but I'll say it anyway.  Mutant Enemy and Joss Whedon owns everything.  And I mean all the words and stuff.  These are  quotations  here.  I'm merely picking out and providing you with the good tidbits =)  --------------------------------------------------  SPIKE: [crashes into "Welcome to Sunnydale" sign] Home sweet home. {Spike's first line}  SPIKE: Yeah, I did a couple of Slayers in my time.  I don't like the brag. [can't keep a straight face] Who am I kidding?  I *love* to brag.  DRUSILLA: Do you love my insides? The parts you can't see? SPIKE: Eyeballs to entrails my sweet. {ever the sweet boyfriend}  FORD: I know who you are. SPIKE: Yeah, I know who I am, too. So what?  CORDELIA: 'I aspire to help my fellow man.' [marks] Check. As long as he's not smelly, dirty or something gross. XANDER: Cordelia Chase, always ready to give a helping hand to the rich and the pretty. CORDELIA: Which, lucky me, excludes you. Twice.  {locked in the basement} CORDELIA: How will she know where to find us? XANDER: Cordelia, this is Buffy's house.  Odds are she'll find us.  SPIKE: [after ritualistic mumbo jumbo] Right then! Now we just let them come to a simmering boil, and remove to a low flame. {too much tv?}  CORDELIA: Die! Die, die, die! Die! XANDER: I think he did, Cordy.  ANGELUS: Well, maybe next time I'll bring you with me, Spike.  Might be handy to have you around if I ever need a really good parking space. {poor crippled Spike in wheelchair}  DRUSILLA: At the museum.  A tomb... [smiles] with a surprise inside. ANGELUS: [holds hand to her forehead] You can see all that in your head? SPIKE: No, you ninny.  She read it in the morning paper. [hands over the paper.]  SPIKE: It's a big rock.  I can't wait to tell my friends.  They don't have a rock this big.  SPIKE: We like to talk big. [indicates himself] Vampires do. 'I'm going  to destroy the world.' [looks at the officer] That's just tough guy  talk. [steps over to the car] Strutting around with your friends over a  pint of blood. [sits on the hood] The truth is, I like this world.  [pulls the cigarette pack from the officer's shirt pocket] You've got...  dog racing, Manchester United. [pulls one out and drops the pack on the  officer] And you've got people. [exhales] Billions of people walking  around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. [lights the  cigarette and takes a drag] But then someone comes along with a vision.  With a real... [exhales] passion for destruction. [takes another drag  and looks at Buffy] Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Picadilly.  Farewell, Leicester Bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?  BUFFY: The whole earth may be sucked into Hell,  and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me  take this opportunity to *not* care.  SPIKE: What, your mum doesn't know? [about Buffy being the slayer] JOYCE: Know what? BUFFY:  That I'm, uh... in a band.  A-a rock band with Spike here.  [looks at Spike pointedly] SPIKE:  Right.  She plays the, the triangle. BUFFY: Drums.  FORREST: "Oh...Check her out. Is she hot, or is she hot?"  RILEY: "She's Buffy."  FORREST: "Buffy? I like that. That girl's so hot, she's buffy."  RILEY: "It's her name, Forrest."   SPIKE: "I don't understand. This sort of thing's never happened to me before."  WILLOW: "Maybe you were nervous."  SPIKE: "I felt all right when I started. Let's try again.  Ow! Oh! Ow! Damn it!"  WILLOW: "Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?"  SPIKE: "Not to me, it doesn't!"  WILLOW: "It's me, isn't it?"  SPIKE: "What are you talking about?"  WILLOW: "Well, you came looking for Buffy, then settled. I--I... You didn't want to bite me. I just happened to be around."  SPIKE: "Piffle!"  WILLOW: "I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always like, 'ooh, you're like a sister to me,' or, 'oh, you're such a good friend.'"  SPIKE: "Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat."  WILLOW: "Really?"  SPIKE: "Thought about it."  WILLOW: "When?"  SPIKE: "Remember last year, you had on that... Fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath?"  WILLOW: "I never would have guessed. You played the blood-lust kinda cool."  SPIKE: "Mmm. I hate being obvious. All fang-y and "rrrr!" Takes the mystery out."  WILLOW: "But if you could..."  SPIKE: "If I could, yeah."  WILLOW: "You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying."  SPIKE: "Don't patronize me."  WILLOW: "Buffy, earlier you agreed with me about Thanksgiving. It's a sham. It's all about death."  BUFFY: "It is a sham, but it's a sham with yams. It's a yam sham."   SPIKE: "Oh, damn it! look, I'm safe. I can't bite anyone. Willow, tell' em what I did."  WILLOW: "You said you were gonna kill me, then buffy."  SPIKE: "Yes, bad, but let's skip that part and get to the part where I couldn't bite you."  WILLOW: "It's true. He had trouble performing."  SPIKE: "Yeah, well, it looks like they've done me for good. Um..."  BUFFY: "What are you saying?"  SPIKE: "I'm saying that Spike had a little trip to the vet and now he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore. I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people."  BUFFY: "So you haven't murdered anybody lately? Let's be best pals."  SPIKE: "Oh, someone put a stake in me."  XANDER: "You got a lot of volunteers in here."  SPIKE: "I just can't take all this mamby-pamby boo-hooing about the bloody Indians."  BUFFY: "Uh, the preferred term--"  SPIKE: "You won. All right? You came in and you killed them and you took their land. That's what conquering nations do. It's what Caesar did, and he's not going around saying, 'I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it.' The history of the world isn't people making friends. You had better weapons, and you massacred them. End of story."   SPIKE: "You exterminated his race. What could you possibly say that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here. Take your bloody pick."  XANDER: Maybe it's the syphilis talking, but... Some of that made sense."  GILES: I made these points earlier, but fine, no one listens to me."   BUFFY: "A bear!"  SPIKE: "You made a bear!"  BUFFY: "I didn't mean to."  SPIKE: "Undo it! Undo it!"  GILES: Look, look, Spike... we have no intention of killing a harmless.. uh, creature.. but we have to know what's been done to you. We can't let you go until we're sure that you're... impotent..."  SPIKE: "Hey!"  GILES: "Sorry, poor choice of words. Until we're sure you're, you're..."  BUFFY: "Flaccid?"  SPIKE: "You are one step away, missy."  BUFFY: "Giles, help! He's going to scold me."  BUFFY: "You want something nicer? Look at my poor neck. All bare and tender and exposed... all that blood just pumping away..."  GILES: "Oh, please."  SPIKE: "Giles, make her stop."  GILES: "If those two don't kill each other, I might lend a hand."   BUFFY: [about their 'wedding'] How 'bout a daytime ceremony.  In the park. SPIKE: Fabulous.  Enjoy your honeymoon with a big pile of dust. BUFFY:  Under the trees.  Indirect sunlight, only. SPIKE: Warm breeze tosses the leaves aside, and once again - you're registering as Mr. and Mrs. Big-Pile-of-Dust  SPIKE: "We're out of Weetabix."  GILES: "We are out of Weetabix because you ate it all- again."  SPIKE: "Get some more."  GILES: "I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood."  SPIKE: "Yep. Well sometimes I like to crumble up the wheetabix in the blood- give it a little texture."  GILES: "Since the picture you just painted means I will never touch food of any kind again you'll just have to pick it up yourself."  SPIKE: "Sissy."  ANYA: ...All you care about is lots of orgasms. [Spike sits up with wheat-a-bit biscuit in his mout.  Giles takes off his glasses.] XANDER: ok... remember how we talked about private conversations and how the're less private when they're in front of my friends. SPIKE: oh, we're not you friends.  Go on. GILES: Please don't.  SPIKE: [to Xander, who seems offended that Spike thinks he's not worthy of being bitten] Alright, yeah fine you're a 'nummy' treat.  SPIKE: "Soddin' sleeping chair is bloody... sodden."  XANDER: "The quake just knocked a couple of pipes lose. There is a wrench hanging up over there by the workbench. Try tightening the coupling."  SPIKE: "Do I look like a plumber to you?"  XANDER: "No, you look like a big mooch that doesnâ€™t lift a finger around here. But I have to get to work."  SPIKE: "Yeah, delivering melted cheese on bread, doing your part to keep America constipated."  SPIKE: Don't look at me. [Xander turns round to see Spike not in his usual black attire but wearing Xander's Hawaiian shirt with red and green leaves and a pair of knee length shorts - graphic comedy]  SPIKE: [after discovering that though he can't hurt humans, he can kill demons] What's this? Sitting around watching the telly while there's evil still afoot.  [turns off the tv that Xander and Willow are watching]  That's not very industrious of you.  I say we go out there [rubs his hands together] and kick a little demon ass! [They stare] What, can't go without your Buffy, is that it?  Too chicken? Let's find her!  She is the Chosen One after all. -Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty! Let's annihilate them.  For hustice - and for - the safety of puppies - and Christmas, right?  Let's *fight* that evil! - Let's KILL something!  Oh, come *on*!  SPIKE: "And . . . by the way, why the hell are you suddenly a Fyarl demon? You just come over all demony this morning?"  GILES: "As a matter of fact, I did. Thanks to Ethan Rayne. You have to help me find him. He must undo this and then he needs a . . . good being killed."  SPIKE: "And I'm just supposed to help you out of the evilness of my heart?"  GILES: "Y-you help me and I-I don't kill you."  SPIKE: "Oh, tremendously convincing. Try it again without the stutter."  GILES: [after being turned into a Fyarl demon - has ram-like horns]  I refuse to become a monster because I look like a monster.  I have a soul.  I have a conscience.  I am a human being.  Oh, stop the car. [runs out and creeps up behind Prof. Walsh, then roars threateningly and waves claws at her.  She runs screaming and Giles rushes back to the car] Right, let's go, then.  WILLOW: It stole Giles' car. XANDER: Why would a demon steal a car? ANYA: Why would a demon steal *that* car?  SPIKE: "Hey!  Wipe your feet when you enter a person's home."  GILES: "Oh, yes.  Careless of me.  Tracking mud all over your, uh . . . mud."  SPIKE: "I admit, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.  Needs a woman's touch. Care to have a crack at it?"  SPIKE: [rushes in, smoking from the sunlight] Close the door! XANDER: Spike? You may want to give up these morning jogs.  ANYA: "You really should get yourself a boring boyfriend.  Like Xander.  You can't have Xander!"  BUFFY: "That was the idea.  Riley was supposed to be Mr. Joe Guy. We were going to do dumb things like hold hands through the daises going tra-la-la."  WILLOW: "Poor Buffy.  Your life resists all things average."  ANYA: "So dump him.  But you can't have Xander!"  BUFFY: "I'll try and remember that."  SPIKE: "Grr! Oh, it's you."  ANYA: "Spike! What are you doing? You made me yell really high."  SPIKE: "Hey! Yeah, I did. I scared you. Gimme money."  ANYA: "I'm not paying you for scaring me."  SPIKE: "You're not paying me. I'm robbing you."  ANYA: "Oh, well now that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me because you've got that chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is... when it's mine."   SPIKE: [angry as Anya brought him to Initiative bar] What are you doing?  You brought me *here*? XANDER: Anya? What are you doing? You brought *him* here? SPIKE: That's what *I* said! Only I hit the 'here' part.  ANYA: [about Spike] Wow. That chip in your head means you can't even point a gun.  How humiliating. XANDER: Doesn't work anyway.  It's a fake. ANYA: Can't even point a decorative gun? XANDER: Give it up for American chipmanship.  WILLOW: Crack a government encryption code on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie.  SPIKE: [about behavioural chips that are in Adam and Riley as well] Oh, so, it's chips all around, is it?  Someone must've bought the party-pack.  GILES: No, i-it's not working out. BUFFY: Giles, are you breaking up with your car? GILES: Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty! BUFFY: Little two-door tramp.  ANYA: "Oh, crap. Look at this! Now I'm burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children, more cash than I can reasonably manage..."  XANDER: "That means you're winning."  ANYA: "Really?"  XANDER: "Yes. Cash equals good."  ANYA: "Ooh! I'm so pleased. Can I trade in the children for more cash?"   HARMONY: "Oh, yeah. I've got my own gang now."  SPIKE: "Is that what those circus freaks are?"  HARMONY: "Uh huh. I mean ... shut up! We're gonna kill the slayer."  SPIKE: "Singing my song now, are you? You should pay me royalties for that one, or at least get your own tune."  HARMONY: "I'm not gonna make the same mistakes you did. I've been doing my homework, reading books and stuff."  SPIKE: "What, Evil for Dummies? Look at you, all puffed up and mighty, HARMONYyou're the new Big Bad. It's, uh... well, let's face it, it's adorable."   HARMONY: So, slayer, at last we meet. BUFFY: We've met, Harmony, you halfwit. [they went to Sunnydale High together]  SPIKE: And I should do what in my spare time? Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?  BUFFY: Would it keep you out of my way?  RILEY: She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.  [Buffy exasperated at Riley] SPIKE: Oh! I saw that. Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome. You should take him home, Slayer. Make him stay there. I've got knitting needles he can borrow.  SPIKE: [looks at Buffy walking away] I will know your blood Slayer. [dramatic pause] I wll make your neck my chalice... and drink deep.  [turns around and strides away purposefully, but falls into an open grave.  As camera pans away...]  Ow!  SPIKE: Okay, is it bigger than a breadbox? HARMONY: [smiling] No. Four left. SPIKE: So it's smaller than a breadbox. HARMONY: [giggling] No! Only three! SPIKE: [quietly annoyed] Harmony... is it a sodding breadbox? HARMONY: [clapping and laughing delightedly] Yes!  Oh my God! Someone's blondie bear is a twenty-question genius!  SPIKE: ...bath in the Slayer's blood.  Gonna dive in it. [with relish] Swim in it.  I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.  --------------------------------------------------  And there's loads more.  One's I've missed, ones that are later on.  This isn't even half season 5 yet.  Gotta love BtVS.  Not Buffy though.  She's quite annoying.  Exasperated annoying.
