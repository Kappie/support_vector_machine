But once we reach the summit, you must go down again and going down is faster than going up. It takes just one section to slack, the whole band won't sound balance or motivated, confident. It takes just one person to change their position in their section and the whole band will sound so different. It just takes one roll for a person to dash down to the bottom of the mountain...   Today there is the napha test, which almost make me die with regret! It's just 10cm! JUST 10CM!! Yet that Mr Lee wanted to go home so much, he didn't want to sacrifice his time. What about mine!? I've never found myself putting others for blame when it's my very own fault. I didn't bother to practise half a year before. I didn't do my very best. I've disappointed everyone that had thought I can do it... I'm... so...sorry.    I hang a fake smile on my face, my heart is dead with regret. Why didn't I bother? WHY!? Sigh. So I dashed up to set my instrument and then get downstairs to play.    It just take one person to change their position to affect the whole band. We switched. Shiting flew to first while hani came over to the thirds. She couldn't play, my confidence disappeared and Nizam no longer had that kind of feel, that urge to enter on the first beat together. So we switched again, we changed over to Jaslyn and Hani went back to seconds. My old pal is back! We played through the pieces loudly and there was no problem until...   One people, One nation, One Singapore. So we changed again, she went back and Erica came in. There shouldn't be a problem. She's a primary school clarinetist! Just the problem with the loudness... Everything was quite OK... But it's pathetic! It's really pathetic! We had gone through everything yesterday! Yet it sounded a thousand miles different! God, what had happened!?    Nizam was in such fiery anger, something which I had not seen before since the last muster parade. It was the sec1s first muster parade, so we just let it off. But now, it's the second. We really cannot afford to lose anymore! Their comments had affected our band so much...  He no longer wear that friendly smile but a stern and strict face. It was so different. Everything can affect the mood of the music. The players who come in at the beginning must have the correct rhythm, correct pace, correct volume. They're the players who are supposedly to boot up other players' confidence. It's just like falling in, isn't it? Everytime, if someone started the trend to say 'ic' loudly with a special intonation, it will follow on and come to an end on a VERY PARTICULAR SPOILER!!! Qiuming!!! That idiot. And the amuse will die off. It's like the same, isn't it? But it's difficult to go up, but very very easy to come down...    And I didn't see Nizam coming out of the school... His anger, was something that had not been expressed a long long time ago... It's such a simple task, a task which every single one of us is capable to fufil. It's everyone's wish, but why? Why isn't everyone motivated? Many are dead with tiredness. My left leg is aching with pain...    I just wished everyone can fufil this very simple wish...
