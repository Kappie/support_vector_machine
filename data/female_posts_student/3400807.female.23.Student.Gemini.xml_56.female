It's weird, but somehow, deciding to get a haircut tonight also motivated me to go work out. :) My friend  urlLink Ilsa  calls it the "reverse Samson" effect. That made me smile. But it seems like it does make a difference somehow, and it's nice to know that it's not just me! :) Um... yes, that   did   in fact deserve an entry all it's own. I'm working on two very deep, very philosophical posts, so cut me some slack! :)
