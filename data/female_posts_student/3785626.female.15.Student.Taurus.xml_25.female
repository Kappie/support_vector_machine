I talked to Tregory today. :) And I think I trust him with everything I have, and that may be a stupid gamble, but I'll take it. I have to understand that my past relationship was the PAST and the present is a gift to me, especially because it's not my past! Is that confusing? Anywho, I was talking to him awhile go and this is like the conversation or close to it. Me: "Have you thought of a boys name yet?"    Him: "No." Me: "Why?" (I'm always asking Why because I like too.) Him: "Because I haven't been thinking about it." Me: "Why?"   Him: "Because what I am thinking about is more important, I'm thinking about the person I love." Me: "Ohhh..." Him: "Do you know who that is?"   Me: "No..." Him: "You don't know...?" Me: "It could be your mom..."      Okay and then we got on a whole different subject. Anyways Saturday, hopefully we can go see Catwoman. Yay! Today he is supposed to come over...Yes!!! I    I love Tregory.   Yes I do.   No question about that.   My trust in him is 100%.   Yes it is.   If I get hurt. Oh dam* well, I'll get over it. Won't I?      Love Cherry Loving Tregory Love
