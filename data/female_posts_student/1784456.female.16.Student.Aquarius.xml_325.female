I rememeber your brother when you were little, and every time i came round, you would have a fight over the T.V remote, and he always won! Ahhh happy days. It's fun being the older sibling, only that my little brother seriously does think that he knows everything so you have to bite your tounge a lot! Ok - big decision - SHOULD I GET MY HAIR CUT? I'm thinking of getting it cut short. and I mean short SHORT SHORT kinda short. Oooh! It reminds me of thet song - "I like short shorts, you like short shorts!" So yeah - ALL COMENTS WELCOME!!! AND WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE USE THE CHATBOX FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!???? Owww!! I have SERIOUSLY *hurt* (What would Moomin Moma say!) up my ankle. :( poo. it hurts every time i move it now. Oh well, i'll just hobble along. Wahoo! I have new trousers! Wooppee! Cos the other ones broke... um... in a kinda embarrasing place! So anyway... Oooh! look at that cloud! It looks like a racing car..... heh heh....
