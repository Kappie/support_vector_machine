It's like oil and water that gets mixed and turns into bullshit, if that makes any sense.  Anyway, tonite I saw Ms. Reid, and 'twas fucking awesome (for lack of a stronger and better phrase. You can't get much better than "fucking awesome"; actually, you can't get better than "fucking awesome". So now I'm in a good, less EMO, more xHARDCOREx mood, and that's what I like. Sorry about the "Death Is Good" post. Well, not really, but if it makes you feel better Ms. Jiang, if you can buy that, please do.  I am about worn out. I just took 4 of my beautiful trileptols and I'm dying. It's time to hit the sack and stare for a few hours (too many naps today).  Peace.
