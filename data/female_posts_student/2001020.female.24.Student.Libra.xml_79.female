I HAVE: a bloated tummy. I WISH: that my dating situation shapes up in 2004. I HATE: the fact that no matter how far ahead I think I am, I am usually wrong. I MISS: my friends in Syracuse! I HEAR: some infomercial on TV. I SEARCH: for that "one true love." I WONDER: if that "one true love" will ever happen to me. I REGRET: leaving LA. I LOVE: not having anything to do. I ACHE: to find my real love. I CARE: about too many things! I ALWAYS: feel tired, no matter what I'm doing. I AM NOT: as happy as you think I am. I DANCE: anytime, any place, when the feeling strikes me! I SING: in the car, where no one can hear me! I CRY: at stupid things. I DO NOT ALWAYS: brush my teeth and wash my face before bed. I FIGHT: with my roommate quite a bit. I WRITE: random poems when I'm procrastinating. I WIN: everyday just by being alive and smiling. I LOSE: my mind sometimes when it comes to X. I CONFUSE: love and lust. I LISTEN: to what my mother says, if she says it the right way. I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: in front of the computer in my apartment...or the bar. I NEED: to lose a few pounds. I AM HAPPY ABOUT: the fact that I'm halfway finished with law school. I SHOULD: get right on job searching over break.  Argh.  So tired.  I had good intentions of spilling my guts (or something like it), but I think I'm too tired.  I honestly don't have one interesting thing to say, but I think I'm just bored.  Ahhh, BORED!  What a lovely concept!  I have already watched three movies (well, part of Seabiscuit, so four) in the span of about 30 hours.  That's so unlike me and sooooo refreshing!  I haven't had an ounce of alcohol and I haven't had a shower, either.  Sometimes I wish I could be a hermit and not care about seeing people or being social.  I should just live at home and let my mind turn to mush and enjoy it!  Look what law school has done to me...made me fantasize about being a good-for-nothing!  My soul is just tired, that's all.  And it's up to me to save it.  I never want kids, I really don't.  I'm 24 and they still make me cringe.  I just want to find my soulmate and live a beautiful life with him.  I wonder where he is...I think I may have worn myself thin with all of the sex I had this past semester.  Every boy I slept with (except 1) had a girlfriend.  I am a despicable person.  My friend C was reading this article in an old Cosmo called, "I Sleep With Your Boyfriend."  Basically, it explains why girlfriended boys seek single girls like us out.  It's supposedly because we are what their girlfriends aren't.  Maybe they can't admit to themselves that their girlfriends aren't enough or maybe they take personal responsibility for it.  Either way, there's something lacking and they see girls who represent the antithesis of their girlfriends, and they're drawn.  I swear I have not pursued any of these boys.  I promise I didn't.  I don't know why they are drawn to me in particular.  Maybe that'll change next semester.  Maybe I will.  And maybe it'll all stay the same and that's that.  I dunno.  My friend R says I have to save my soul.  But am I really affecting my soul this way, or just being young and having fun?  I have a great time, and I'm detached from all of them except X.  Maybe it's X that I need to save my soul from, not the others that are just sex for sex.  -sigh-  I don't wanna think about this.  MERRY CHRISTMAS!
