In hate… I squeeze More and more… In hate… I scream: - Take away this pain!  - Take away my darkness!  Die my sweet angel Suffocating in my hands.  Where used to be Love Now! Is full of Hate.  Die my sweet, innocent angel.  Burn in HELL!  Cause now, I just don’t care!  ]-[ellMistress * Strait From Hell 4U
