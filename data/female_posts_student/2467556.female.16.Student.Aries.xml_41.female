Have you ever had that feeling of how you REALLY wanted to talk to someone like right then, but then they weren't online and there was no way you could reach them by phone?  Yeah i had that feeling today.  It sucked.  Coppell plays tomorrow and Dallas plays Atlanta tomorrow.  Joy.  I hope Niko scores a goal when i come home.  That would be great.  It would totally brighten my next couple days.  I get my late christmas present from Nathaniel tomorrow!!!!!  Yaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  I think its a cd of some sort, but i dunno!  I'm excited.  Hmmm lets see what else can i talk about......Oh yeah! My 13 yr old 7th grade brother started shaving his face today.  I dunno why, its not like there was any hair to shave......but whatever, its his face and skin.    Je ne veux pas travailler, Je ne veux pas dejeuner, Je veux que l'oublier, Et puis, Je fuis. ^ part of our song we have to learn in french...don't know if i put all the words in though....  Happy Hockey Thursday to all!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
