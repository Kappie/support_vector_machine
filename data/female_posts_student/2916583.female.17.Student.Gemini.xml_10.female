I live in the very small village (cause it's too small to be a city or town or some crazy other name for some group of dwellings with more than 20,00 people) of Chester.  I go to TD, and I'm in 11th grade.  Here's a cast of characters I'll mention very frequently.  First names only!  Me - of course!  I suppose that since this is my random blog that I should mention myself.  Well I'll have to finish this later. bye.      My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    (note: I'm sixteen, so I act my age.  yay!)
