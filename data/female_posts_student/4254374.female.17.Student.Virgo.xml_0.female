He came back later  shared his lunch though I'd a sandwich. We discussed Korean  Singaporean politics (of all topics!)  he left again to study. Though I'd work, it's good chatting with Mi-suk. Later, we met Young Kyu  Thamar outside the cafeteria. I bought Mi-suk Tiramisu gelato  got myself my favourite pistachio. Thamar tried some but he preferred chocolate stuff. Mi-suk  Young Kyu then invited Thamar  I to dinner.    We watched a bit of Bruce Almighty. Dinner was superyummylicious, though I ate less pork stomach. As it was late, I accepted Young Kyu's invitation to sleep overnight. Opa's vacanted room smelt of cologne. It's been 7 days since his last night in Sydney. Mi-suk  Young-Kyu got me settled in very comfortably. At 11.30pm, I snuggled into the bed, entered slumberland quickly  slept for a good 9 hours.  A warm bed is a great way to end a day.
