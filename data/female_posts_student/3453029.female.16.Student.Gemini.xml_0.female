Jason Mraz, Fuel, and Live were the ones that performed at the concert!  They were all really good!  I think Jason Mraz was my favorite though!  He has a really good sense of humor and he seemed really nice...plus...his music was a little more low key than the other two! The only bad thing was that I forgot to change into tennis shoes before we left, so I had on these big brown lace up dress boots, and since we had a long way to walk when we got there, I've got five blisters on the bottom of my feet now!  It really sucks! Anyway, we left at 11:30 and the band, Live, was still playing.  We still hadn't eaten anything so, we stopped at The Waffle House to get a bite to eat, since it was the only thing open that late.  LOL!  So, it was a fun night! Then, since today is Memorial Day, we had a cook out here at my granny's.  It's been fun so far.  I''ve mostly been sitting around just watching movies. I just finished watching A Walk To Remember!  One of my favorite movies!  I cry everytime!  Well, I'm outta here!
