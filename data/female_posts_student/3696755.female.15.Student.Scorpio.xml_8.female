You know the type the one that know matter what has got a smile on and is just like everything is fine things will get better :-).It really bothers me. Becasue think about it, when somtings worng, somethings wrong, its not healthy to bottle up feelings like that and if your always so cheerfull and have this BS attitude about everything being perfect then, your not expressing our self right. Like ive been talkin to people and they can say to me with the biggest smile on their face that "things could be better", its never "things suck" "fuck everyone" "i wanna die" it just "ehhh cant complain i guees, things could be worse!" And it makes me mad. And then another thing that bothers me even more is when somesone tryin to make me feel better. And theer just all cheerfull liek "thigs cant be that bad?" and im like ya they are. And the every cloud has a silver lingin thing, every cloud doesnt. And i dont liek to be to overly positive when im down case it just makes me feel worse, cause i look at it like wow things could be sooo much better, but there not. There crappy. It sucks. But like someone told me resently, thats "my fault" and im just "a bitter little bitch." Witch made me feel better, esp. since it was followed by and "its ok tho u can fix that if u look on the brite side more..."????? And then i was just like, grrrrrr. And when i get mad at them and tell them to stop they get all "mad" and are like im just trying to help, well your not. I love the people who dont sugar coat things, who are just like, dude that sucks. Like "itll go away eventually but that really sucks right now im sorry man." you no?  id much rather have a person tell it like it is ( casue that makes me feel better to no that people half understand) then for them to lie to me. And tell me how great things are when they dont even know. Like how do they no how great things are or arnt? Theyre not me? They dot go threw the same shit i do. But whatever, i guess theres nothing i can do then to just block em out and pretend there not all "mr. sunshine on my god dam sholders" all the time.
