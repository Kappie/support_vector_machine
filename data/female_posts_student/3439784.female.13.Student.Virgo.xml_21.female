"Kiss Me Fool"    Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  Kiss me fool, if you care If your words have any meaning. Playing it cool is so unfair Why this veil of secrecy? God forbid, your friends found out what we did Why can't someone like you be someone like me?  Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  Touch me fool, if your allowed. I'll be dancing in the corner It's so cruel to play it proud, take your hands and cover. I'm aware that all in love is fair, but that's no reason to make me feel this way.  Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  And it hurts me so bad to deny it, oooh these feelings are out of control. Do you know what it's like to want something so bad... and then having to let it go? And it hurts me to know that this time in our lives... so soon will be in the past and you spend it pretending your playing it cool. Never knowing, never knowing, never knowing what, what we should've been.
