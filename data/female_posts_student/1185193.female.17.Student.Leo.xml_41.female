He showed me that my heart can still flutter, and that was refreshing.  But he was just the object of infatuation (oh, did I  mention he was like 25?).    I can't deny true love.  I don't use the word love very lightly.  So it's important to me...  Feeling pretty bleh today for a million reasons, but one in particular. I present to you, an ode to love:  Artist: Sheryl Crow Album: Tuesday Night Music Club (great cd, btw)  Song: Strong Enough   God, I feel like hell tonight Tears of rage I cannot lie I'd be the last to help you understand Are you strong enough to be my man?  Nothing's true and nothing's right So let me be alone tonight Cause you can't change the way I am Are you strong enough to be my man?  Lie to me I promise I'll believe Lie to me But please don't leave, leave, don't leave  I have a face I cannot show I make the rules up as I go So try and love me if you can Are you strong enough to be my man?  When I've shown you that I just don't care When I'm throwing punches in the air When I'm broken down and I can't stand Would you be man enough to be my man?  Lie to me I promise, I'll believe Lie to me But please don't leave   And this song too: I Shall Believe  Come to me now And lay your hands over me Even if it's a lie Say it will be alright And I shall believe  I'm broken in two And I know you're on to me That I only come home When I'm so all alone But I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly you won't give up on me And I shall believe And I shall believe  Open the door And show me your face tonight I know it's true No one heals me like you And you hold the key  Never again would I turn away from you I'm so heavy tonight But your love is alright And I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly You won't give up on me And I shall believe I shall believe
