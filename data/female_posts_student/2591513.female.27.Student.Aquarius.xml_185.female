Like my sister said, it is always good to keep an open mind and to read from different sources.  When I get a chance I think I am going to read more into all this.  I just thought I would share the link...only if you are interested.   urlLink Moore   Went bowling yesterday and had a lot of fun.  I left the sisters at the bowling hour for almost 5 hours...SORRY!  I seriously didn't mean to, just had to run around Oceanside yesterday to pick up Ed.  So for Jessica, Leila and Kata, so sorry.  Hey I did pay for the bowling and a pitcher of beer.  Sorry again...and yes I would have been pissed...but if you had a good excuse, I would have understood, after a day...haha  Okay everyone enjoy what is left of the day.
