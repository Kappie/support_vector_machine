Now I'm listening to my H.I.M. CD. I think next time I'm going to get Breaking Benjamin. Costs 13.99 at Sam Goody. And then maybe CKY, but I have most of the songs burnt on CD's. Lol. Talked to Tregory today, I'm happy. I wish I could just tell him how I felt. I wrote a poem, it sucks, but tells exactly how I feel I guess....  Words don't express enough for me When I try to tell you how I feel It just comes to these 3 words: I Love You I don't know any other way to let you know this Except stay by your side and always be true Do you really know how much you mean to me? I think about you all the time I just can't get you off my mind I wish I could tell you everything I feel But all it comes down to is... I LOVE YOU  I believe I started to cry. And that's never really happened before, I've never cried over a boy, and especially for no good reason, or is that a good reason? Anyways *sigh* And because I'm 15, it just scares the living bageeba's out of me, I might get hurt. But that's just a chance I'll have to take, right? RIGHT!!!
