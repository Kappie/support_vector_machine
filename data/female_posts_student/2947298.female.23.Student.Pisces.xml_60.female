Cafe Express (second year they are re-doing the facilities we all use) 4. H Wing Lecture Hall 5. Outlook Housing  Most of these projects are on their second year.  Non of them will have been finished at their projected time, or within the projected semester, or year. Somebodys relatives are getting paid very well for doing these jobs and it sucks because it is an inconvience I am paying for.  I would like to see the gym, they have been doing that for three years, before I end my fifth year here.  So we have no facilities to work out in, and then the eating.  We have had all but one semester with all our cafeterias open in my five years here.  The mansion is being changed for reasons unknown.  Lecture hall would be nice thank you for removing the asbestos, or so we hope.  And outlook, another housing project that was supposed to be sustainalbe but do to the purposefull slow progression it will no longer be that way, in fact we are lucky if the 300 students that are moving in to part of the building will have housing, lets hope.  Lets not even start on the fact that this seven floor building has only two elevators (oak and maple have only two, that never work and they are only 4 floors i see a coming problem morons).   Personal:  My Dad and Diana were married this Friday, Congratulations!  It was a very nice small ceremony and the reception was great.  I was glad to be able to see my family all together again.  My Aunt Goo has not been able to attend a family function in over a year and finally she was able to take off to be with us.  And even the weather was nice, despite the forcast for rainy skies. Now I must go back to work and then finish my very long and boring term paper... yay
