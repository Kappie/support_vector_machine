The whole time as a child and a teenager, your supposed to be finding your self, but what if you can't even see who you are. All my child hood I was never forced into religion by my parents, we never attended church and I had never saw a bible. My grandparents on the other hand, sent me a bible in the mail for me to read. I thought it was a pretty good story. That's all it was to me was a story. Then I was shunned from the people at school, because in 5th grade, the only thing you really know about your self is what you belive in. All I knew was that I had nothing to believe. In 7th grade, I had made a choice to myself that i would study diffrent types of religion, to make sure I was affirmend in my agnostic ways. At the same time there was need of participants in the local youth org. i went for 7 or 8 months. Comming to the soild conclusion I am agnostic. I had to go threw all of that just to reach a conclusion that I am havingto defend from people who were forced into it and had no choice! I think it's bullshit that these people can go around and say shit about my religion when they dont even have a clear mind of thir own. I am so pissed off about it....im gonna go clear my head...I get so worked up over this...someone save me..
