For a long time I lived in denial, not wanting to accept that a person, such as myself, could, in fact, agree with conservatives on more then one issue. Over time however, I came to realize that I wasn't nearly as liberal as I originally thought.   I'm not a bleeding-heart liberal. When it comes to money, I'm pretty much a free-market conservative.  The republican party headed by Reagan, is a party that I have a lot more similarities with then the Bush administration. I'm not saying I agree with everything Reagan did or stood for, because I don't. However, I'm simply tryting to point out that, I am, at times conservative.   Reagan's republicanism was one of much more optimism then today's. It was more expansive, and focused less on government. As  urlLink andrew sullivan  said, "He would never have presided over the massive increases in domestic spending that Bush has; he would not have signed onto a new entitlement for Medicare, a program he first opposed in its entirety; he would not have played the anti-gay card that Karl Rove has; and he would never have recast his party into one where only fundamentalist Christians are ultimately, fully at home."  The religion issue, is perhaps one of the biggest differences between our current president and Reagan. Reagan's position is obviously much more liberal. I mean, he was a divorced man who hardly went to church, and on top of that he campaigned against homophobia and brought AIDS awareness to the public's attention. In addition, according to sullivan, "there was always the old Democrat in Reagan's new Republican, a deep sense of civility, a wry sense of humor, a faith leavened with skepticism, a conservatism informed by liberalism's faith in the future."   I'll end this little spiel with a quote: "I hope that when you're my age you'll be able to say, as I have been able to say: we lived in freedom, we lived lives that were a statement, not an apology" -Ronald Reagan (1911-2004)  hmmm. i wonder if we will.
