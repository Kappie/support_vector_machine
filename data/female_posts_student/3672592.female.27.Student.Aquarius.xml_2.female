My Dad likes to tell people that we are from Union Valley. Union Valley is small community just big enough to get a sign on the road, but not big enough to have the population put on it. The only thing other than houses in Union Valley is a gas station, a fire department, and a couple of grease spoon eating joints. Not to much here. My parents house sits on 16 acres of beautiful landscape.   urlLink    Picture of My house       urlLink
