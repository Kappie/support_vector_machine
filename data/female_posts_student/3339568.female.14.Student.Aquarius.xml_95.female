And then we had a flashback memory of the good 'ol Mimosa days, where Mrs. Crummy (the librarian) would be talking, and we would all be sitting in front of her, not listening, just concentrating on the maze screensaver on the computer behind her. Haha. She got very frustrated. Ahhh...good times, ay Gem? Good times.....
