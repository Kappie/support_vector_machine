This causes Wal-Mart to mark down their bananas every Tuesday so as to compete. SO if you want bananas  - buy them on Tuesdays. There seems to be a local banana price war going on. It became a big joke for my husband and I "Banana Tuesdays." There are people out there who rescheduled their grocery shopping trips for Banana Tuesdays...and I know we have made many an extra trip just to bananas on a tuesday. These days, the gas price and cost balances out any money one might have saved on Banana Tuesday...so its really not worth an extra trip. But if bananas are your fruit of choice...Tuesdays are your favorite day of the week. Thus Banana Tuesday.  --Mack
