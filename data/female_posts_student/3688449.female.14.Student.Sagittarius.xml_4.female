Blogs should be spontaneous, not premeditaded. Haha. Um, my french teacher told me that I should proofread my work, but did I listen? No. I do whatever I want! This is another entry that shows that I have no life...Um...so yah, if you see any typos in my blog, just deal with it, cause I sure don't care. Well, I really think this might be the last blog of the day folks! But guess what? THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW!!!! LEBIF!!! (yah Joy, I made a little change to it. Now it stands for Laughing Evilly Because It's Funny) LOL! I'm off all, and remember, Love and Madness! (not that I'm stealing the autograph saying from the gay guy at Sheer Madness or anything...) YAY 2004 WASHINGTON DC TRIP!!
