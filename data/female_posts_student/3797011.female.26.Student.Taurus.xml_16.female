There's a secret place in my heart  A place where I love you so true  A place where the attraction first started  This is where it lives and blooms and grows  Cherishing our every memory, every feeling  I will love you forever, this I know.   But are these really secret places?  Unknown corners of my very being  Hidden without the slightest traces?  To you they are open, you have the key  These places are just as much yours as they are mine  For without you these secret places would never be.  ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
