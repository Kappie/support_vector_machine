Content, I guess you'd say. I haven't got any complaints....or at least, no REAL complaints. lol  This week has been wonderful so far. I can't wait for Saturday!!!!!! It's going to be so much fun. Though I do wish Barry could have come. Ah well. Charlie's coming! ^_^ He hasn't come to a DDR Party in ages!!! I don't have the heart to write a long blog today. Too much other stuff that needs doing.  Love you all! Shannon "Does it look like a Q to you? How about now?" Quagmire from Family Guy
