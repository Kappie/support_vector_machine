"I woke up this morning, The sunshine was shining I put on my happy face I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful To put on my happy face"  okaledokalee so I realize that the sun wasn't shining when I woke up, but you know what I mean don't you?  Ok so this has recently been described by one person as legendary (yes you know who you are), but I think that is going a little far, I would however say that it is confusing and random! Probably nothing more and nothing less……ok maybe less, lol,   la de la de da woop de woop de do la de la de da and a woop de woop de do  ‘can ya tell what it is yet?’  hmmmm how to cheer up a step by step guide:  1.    Realize that its probably not as bad as you think  2.    You are young and whatever it is, is a drop in the ocean of your life  3.    That you are alive  4.    Talk to someone (I’m always here for any of you, I am always happy to listen, I’m always happy to try and help)  5.    Lastly if none of that works come and see me, the Queen of being Happy and if you don’t feel slightly cheery after spending time in the company of someone that never lets a frown cross her face, then I dunno what to say, and I doubt this shite guide will help you!!  Ah yes in case you haven’t yet been able to establish the meaning of my blog, let me help you, it has no meaning, lol, it is here purely for me to write random stuffs about random subjects, on a very random computer, that has a very odd owner, that has a very strange house, that is in a very little street, that is in a very dodgy town, that is in a very squished country, that is in a very large world, that’s in an infinite galaxy, that’s in a extremely un-explored universe, that is probably 1 marble in a bag of marbles, that is one bag in a store full of bags, that is 1 store in a retail park, that is one retail park in an land full of retail parks, that is 1 land in a world, that is one world in galaxy, that is one galaxy in a universe, that is one universe that is probably 1 marble in a bag full of marbles……………and so the idea continues!!    And breathe  La de la de da Woop de woop de do La de la de da And a woop de woop de do   Personilty Disorders       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Low       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Low       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Low       urlLink Narcissistic :    Low       urlLink Avoidant :    Low       urlLink Dependent :    Low       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --       Ooh yes, i have decided to add a title to my posts, they will always be quotes, lol  Ah what a beautiful day it is today, its days like today that we should all be thankful for those who have payed the ultimate sacrifice and died so that we can enjoy freedom and prosperety!! Today is day that if you have feeling low, you should look outside and see the beauty in the world. You will realize and be thankful for the life you lead, yes so everyone has their ups and down, (even me-but not very often-once in a blue moon), but the trick is to realize that you are more fortunate than many!! Ok so having low self confidence is a different story, and i have no idea how to fix it, believe me i know all about that, i have probably the lowest confidence ever recorded,lol, but i still wake up in the mornings with a smile on my face, and go through the day enjoying every second of it! i wont let having no confidence ruin my life, and neither should anyone else who has this problem!! I love each minute of my life, and i cant wait to keep living, i enjoy the challenges that life throws at us,  I LOVE LIFE AND SO SHOULD YOU!!!  Life is a beautiful thing, experience, enjoy, and dont regret!!!!   Live life and enjoy it to the full Don't let anything or anyone hold you back Have dreams and aspirations, try achieve all that you desire!!  "Live life to the full, there is plenty of time to be dead"  What else to say.....nothing i don't think, hmmmmm what else what else could there possilbly be, sod it i don't know, my brain (lol) has been exhausted by todays lol!!!!  Much Love  Love Your Nat  Who after reading this you will probably no longer want to be your Nat, but the nutter you pass in the street, a nutter you don’t know, and never have known, lol  XxxXxXxXxxXxXxXxXXxXxXxXxXxXxxXxXxXxx
