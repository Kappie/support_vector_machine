Souls that brush up against each other, that can be familiar with one another without having to meet, or without having to spend a whole hour together. Entities because it can happen between a sick old woman and a business man, or a child and a dog, or a person walking and a lonely teen staring out from the doorway. People can know each other from a gesture, a glance, without having to go for coffee and make superficial conversation. What gift is this? It isn't a bond between the two - more of a silver thread they both know is there, they both might not mention, but that replenishes both, quenches their thirst. It heals wounds, gladdens hearts, brings tears to eyes, draws people together and leaves them wondering if the other felt the same thing. It somehow brings slight pangs of what can only be described as compassion or nostalgia, the wish to know the whole of someone, not just what the hazy window of the retinas shows. It turns two into one for an instant, and in that instant they are each other's grandparents, each other's children, friends,  soulmates , vulnerable but strengthened through each other. Some friends can achieve it over time, some friends have it from the very beginning. But everyone feels it once in their lifetime, that this person understands them, could embrace them, could cry on their shoulder and have the other cry with them.  ...or maybe that's just me.
