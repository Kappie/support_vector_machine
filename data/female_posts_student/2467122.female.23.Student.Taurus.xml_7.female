Went with Vinnie and Vanessa (who of course made sure to get totally decked out in B's gear) and we had a great time.  The nosebleed seats were just not cutting it, so we used the penguin connection to move ourselves down to some comfy chairs- with padding!!!  Got on the Jumbotron- ok, so just my head and Vanessa's hat- but it still counts!!!  I'm on the STAR 93.7 website, at least that's what they told me when they took the picture... And I even got a free shirt.    But that's not all...  TONS AND TONS of awesome pictures with the Bruins (the Rangers were not in very good moods after the game- they all booked it out of the locker room).  The B's are not only awesome on the ice, but there are lotsa hotties on that team.  I got to take pictures and shake their hands.  SWEET!!!  Topped it all off with some yummy food delivered straight to my room.  Now I have something besides Reduced Fat Triscuits... HOORAY!!!  Life is good... If only I didn't have homework to do, it would be perfect.  *sigh*  Damn my procrastination...   *me*
