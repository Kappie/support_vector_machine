I don't know why or how this even started, all I know is that this crush developed soon after my seeing my first Bond movie... and since then I've been hooked on Sean Connery c. 1960's, guys with really atrocious sean connery accents, and short, slightly hairy guys who seem angry that they are short in the first place . I don't quite know how this will begin to help my single situation although to be quite honest...I don't think it could hurt. :)
