There were no complications, no critical areas were damaged, and she is doing great!  She was awake through most of the surgery so that they could perform electromagnetic mapping (in order to avoid cutting into her speech and motor areas), and was actually able to talk to her mom at one point.  She said to her mom over the phone, "Yeah, I'm doing fine.  Don't have too big of a party out there without me!"  Apparently she just ate a big dinner and is now getting ready to take a nice, long nap.  This just goes to show the power that prayer has.  I had a very good feeling about this surgery, and I really wasn't worried at all; I knew that Brandi was in the best of hands here on earth as well as from the Man upstairs.  For the first time in what seems like forever, they are talking about Brandi's future in terms of years, not months.  Dr. Sawaya gives her at least 4-7 years, and that's with current technology.  He told her to go back to teaching, to get married, and to have children.  That last part brightened the rest of my life, because that's all that Brandi really wants to do.  I want to see that she gets that chance, and now it looks like she just might.   Thank you everyone who has been praying for Brandi and our family--it means more than you'll ever possibly know!
