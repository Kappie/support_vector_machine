Loonies and Loonettes -- start your engines and let's warm-up for the hump. For this warm-up, put your humility away and using the letters H-A-M-B-U-R-G-E-R reveal to us nine wonderful things about you.    I am:      HOPELESSLY devoted to those I love;   AMAZINGLY creative and smart;   MAGNIFICENT at my job;   BEAUTIFUL inside and out;   UNPREDICTABLE and loads of fun;   READY always to explore and learn;   GRATEFUL to be alive;   EAGER to grow and become more than I already am;   RADIANT when I am happy!      [Wow, I think a lot of myself :)]     This week let's do a getting-to-know-you-hump mixed with some cwaziness to make it a fun hump too. Ready? Hump it!   01. You have opened a fast food joint that features YOUR favorite food prepared in many different forms. What would the name of your joint be? List several things that would be on the menu.  Potatoes 'R' Us. (ripping off  Forrest Gump)  You can broil 'em, bake 'em, fry 'em, boil 'em, mash 'em... there's potato salad, potato pancakes, baked potato, potato chips, creamed potatoes, french fries...   02. You are holding a public auction for all your belongings ... what is the oddest or silliest item that would be on the auction block?  I have a collection of several weird and wonderful pillows... Hello Kitty, Powerpuff Girls, Daffy Duck, fuzzy hearts...   03. If you could buy "instant anything" what would it produce when you just add water?  Instant money, bay-bee!   04. If it were possible to miniaturize any sort of environment and keep it in an aquarium-like enclosure, what type of environment would it be and what sort of creatures would you keep in it?  My workplace, and all of my coworkers, especially the evil ones, will be my little pawns to play with as I please. Wah-ha-ha!   05. If you were offered a "Get Out of Jail Free" type of card today (i.e. magically fix something, get out of doing something, etc...) what would the card be for?  I would get out of going to work all week (but still get paid) and get my butt down to the beach, stat!      Hump-a-rific!
