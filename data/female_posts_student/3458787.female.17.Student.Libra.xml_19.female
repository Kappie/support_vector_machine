And thereis also this certain group of people whom we do not really know (can say they are acquaintances or maybe sometimes even a little more than that) but just see something in them that we do not have- sometimes its the way they carry themselves, some behaviour of theirs or maybe just the way they look.    In your mind, you see them as really nice, interesting people that you would like to get to know better. You basically have a very positive impression of them. Then when you come to discover that they do stuff that are against your ideals (for example if they lied to someone, tried to smoke or drink when they are underagedor stole something for just the trill of it), you tend to get really disappointed. You don't immediately get a negative impression of them - you still like them and all but you get really disappointed with them and kind of feel sad. Have you ever experienced such stuff before?
