I hung my favorite shirt on the floorbaord, wrinkled up from pulling pushing tasting. You keep twisting the truth that keeps me thrown askew. Misguided by the 405 'cause it lead me to an alcoholic summer. I missed the exit to your parents' house hours ago. Red wine and the cigarettes... hide your bad habits underneath the patio."                          "She had a history of killing herself  I had a habit of dying  I think she gave me something to live for  I guess I helped her pass the time   And I had a vision of seeing things straight  She had the heart of a liar  I never saw her leave me once  She never felt me beside her "
