And typing is so much easier than writing.  I'm not terribly concerned about being able to be honest. That's never been a problem. I'm honest to the point of making people uncomfortable. Sometimes they would much rather have tea and ignore the elephant in the middle of the room.  Being too honest is much more of a concern, that is, since I'm writing whatever is on my mind that means I'll sometimes be writing about the people around me instead of just about myself. We can't write about ourselves in a vacuum as none of us live in one.  So if I write about my interractions with other people am I disrespecting their right to privacy? This being online and all? It doesn't bother me to write in a book that never leaves my house. It is okay with me if someone reads what I've written about them. If I say it I should be willing to own it. But if someone else reads about a personal conversation between me and one of my friends or relatives have I betrayed their trust or embarrassed them. If the situation were reversed I wouldn't care, but not everyone feels that way.  On the other hand if I write about an issue that other people are struggling with then I've helped them to see how someone else feels.  Either to see things from a different perspective or to know they aren't alone. There have been times I desperately wanted to know how other people were handling situations I was going through. It would have been wonderful to come across someones honest deep down thoughts. Their internal dialogue. The world needs more of that. The public face people put on is never helpful and often harmful. Are these theoretical friends and relatives being selfish or just  big fat babies? Is it my place to decide?  And what about me? I could certainly use a table of sorts to lay things out on so I can sort them and try to make sense of them.  And go back and reflect on them later when I'm in a different frame of mind. Getting feedback from other people would be so helpful.  Let's just see how it goes.
