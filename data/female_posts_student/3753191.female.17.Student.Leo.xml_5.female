I can't wait for classes to start so I have something to do.  I had planned on doing something with Christina, but she's leaving for nursing school soon.  This sucks.  Anyway, I don't really have much to say today.  I did want to post my favorite picture from Sophie's 2nd birthday party we had for her at Chuck E. Cheese.      Just hilarious and adorable all at once.  lol.  I absolutely love it.  :)  I'm hoping that storm, Earl, doesn't make his way up here.  If he does, he'll hit on my birthday and we had planned on going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg.   Um, what else?  We're going bowling today (yippee).  It should be amusing to say the least.
