But I'm so sick of that bullshitt I'm not even going to elaborate.  grr I have a bio test tomorrow... This week we've been growing bacteria in agars, which was a real kick seeing what grew more crap, the swab from the doorknob or the on from the inside of a desk.   my head is totally empty, actually... blogger seems not to be working so I didn't get to read much, maybe I should try the recently updated list, but they always turn out to be in another language.  sorry for this pitiful post, but I'm tapped.
