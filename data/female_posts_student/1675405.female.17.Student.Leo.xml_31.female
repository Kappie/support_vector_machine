It is nearly 1,500 words long, which isn't really a big deal, but then again it is because it was an extremely difficult topic to write about: The Positive Benefits of Human Relationships. I'm so proud. :-) I learned a lot of new things, and I'm actually really surprised at how much I enjoyed writing it. I've spent the last 6 weeks trying to pen an acurate definition of love, and I've finally realized that with all of the words I've written about it, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface. Love is just to deep to describe, and to varying to pin down. It's different for everyone, and how am I supposed to be able to honestly say I've written a definition when I've never actually felt love for someone of the opposite sex in a romantic manner.   Tomorrow I get to stay at home again and chill, and yay (!), get to go shopping tomorrow night and skip the game at the same time, if that isn't the best thing that's happened to me all week. I am really hating those darn games, and it's just too cold on top of everything else. The people aren't actually that bad. Okay okay, Jessi and Aaron are always drowing in each others eyes, Ricky keeps asking me if Heather likes him (which, God no, she doesn't), and Marie is too busy reveling in her own baton twirling skills to notice anything around her. But I have fun with Heather, and that is great.   Mom and Dad's 18th anniversary was tonight. They went out for a few hours to eat at Kork -n- Kettle (where I might be going for homecoming?) and came back home because they felt a little sick. But on a more "romantic" note, I think that is so unbelievably awesome. Mom just told me not too long ago that she was 16 when she got married to Dad. That is absolutely crazy, yet so completely enthralling that I am left drooling to hear more. I couldn't even imagine acquiring a worthwhile boyfriend this year, yet alone find the person that I am destined to spend the rest of my life with. But, hey, you never know; I doubt either of my parents thought it to be too attainable at the time either. I guess sometimes things work out totally different than you may have expected, and who's to argue? God is keeping an eye out, and He wouldn't let something too bad happen to those that He loves so dearly.... right?
