But, thanks to blogger...they were closed for construction...so, without it i stayed up until 2:30am in tears because...just a mixture of emotions. I got less than 3 hours of sleep that nite and was still mad enough to fuel myself for the rest of the day..well, maybe it was just because everyone execpts to see this happy girl all the time and when you lie to yourself and others you kinda turn into that i guess. I would find myself thinkin about how this guy i had liked so much, the first guy i didnt look at one day and say "omg hes so hot im gonna chase him", hes not even hot honestly...it was just we clicked in so many different ways he was almost just like me. I dont even know how to explain it. After a lot of thinking and crying it hit me why i was so pissed off..it wasnt because he liked my best friend and a girl he could NEVER get with because of her love for her current boyfriend and she has no intrest in him what so ever besides being friends, but it was because of the potenal of ruining our friendship. He took that step that could have caused me to drop all feelings for him, even as a friend and end it all there, over something he cant have...i wouldn't risk a friendship over something i couldnt have or get. It just made me feel really used and like i was just something for entertainment. Yeah, he said "we're really good friends and i dont want to fuck our friendship up" yeah..well u said some pretty fucked up things and it hurt me..do u think i'll honestly look at you the same again?! Guys make no sense. Just when you think you have everything going for you and things are looking brighter your "good friend" puts you in 2nd place over someone he's only known for a week max and has only seen once, and it will prob be the last time. damn..part of me just wants to kick and scream and cry and tell him how much i hate him, and then the other part of me wants him to hug me while i do it and let me get it all out and then tell me how everything will be ok. It's weird..idk how to explain it, i just know it sucks major ass. It's hard for me to hate people and its hard to make me mad..but he did it. he did something only a few people have managed to do. I dont think he understands, yeah, he told me i made him feel like shit..but how does he think he made me feel?! i felt like shit stepped on twice. I want this perfect guy who will be there for me and not lead me on and not even think about liking my best freakin friend or any of my friends. Yeah, he told me he didnt like kaela like that..he swore to me...then the next day his excuse for lieing was "i didnt want to hurt your feelings" bullshit..u could have been honest with me and i might have taken it a little better. But yeah, he also cares about me and my feelings...yeah ok. He sure does show it. It's not the fact that he doesnt like me the way i once liked him, its the fact that he risked our friendship..like it meant nothing to him. OVER SOMETHING HE CANT OR WONT EVER HAVE. Oh well, i decided i was gonna make him feel like a total dick and like shit. So tonite when he gets his sorry ass online and pops up and says "hey" like nothing ever happened (cuz according to him we should just forget..how can something like this be forgotten?! hello i still remember 2nd grade) i prob wont talk too much and it will get him wondering..and then i'll end up snapping and letting him have it like the little girl kicking and screaming with tears running down her face, i'm the same girl but with mascara to follow. I'm growing up, but i still want that little girl. I want that worry free blonde child whose only concern is if she gets that piece of candy at the checkout after she's been good while momma shopped. I dont want to worry about grades, school, realtionships. I dont want to grow up just yet. I want to stay behind..and maybe that's why some say im so immature. I am immature, i can be serious at times..but why waste lifes good moments being so damn serious? One day there will be a time where i will have to be almost all but immature, so i want to be immature while i can. I want to live my life with no regrets. I want to hold on to so many things, but most of them are already out of reach. Well, tomorrow is my 16th birthday and i should be excited..wow 16!!! i've always looked forward to it. But, honestly..i'm just not in the mood for it. Maybe tomorrow i will be...but idk. I hope so at least. I hope tonite things get better with jordan and i hope kaela talks some sense into him and i want him to say hes honest to god sorry and give me the biggest apology imaginable. I want him to honestly be pretty damn sorry. He hurt me. It reminds me of the time Trevor pulled something simimlar, execpt it wasnt my best friend..it was just me. He told me he didnt mean "lylas" when he told me and how i didnt mean ne thing to him...yeah...that hurt worse than having jordan like kaela and not me, but trevor and i moved on..and we're ok today, as ok as i'm sure we will ever be. Things just flow better when i can type them out while listening to a song (100 years by five for fighting). "the sun is getting high, we're moving on" I wish i saw a bunny like donnie darko....
