I was a little sad at the end of JOA today even though it was a sorta happy ending it was sad too. I was noooooooo.   I had a dream about Chris last night it was very odd. We were fish and sally-anne was a fish too and another boy, it was very odd and we swam for ages but then we turned into people and i was climbing out of the pool which was right next to the trainstation, like in the road when Chris took my hand and pulled me back under the water but the crazy thing was i could breathe and we swam to the bottom of the pool, he picked something up and we swam back up again and then he did this incredable smile that made me melt (not literally).  Then i was on the school bus and lee and scott were there and they were laughing at my socks, which were my whote arm warmers. Then sophie was smiling at me. I got home and amanda asked me if i wanted to earn some money cleaning houses. SO we went to this huge house down my road and it was open so we cleaned the stuff and took the dog that lived there "kate" for a walk. I accidently stepped on this man's garden adn he began yelling at me. We gave back the dog and then i woke up. it was very weird.
