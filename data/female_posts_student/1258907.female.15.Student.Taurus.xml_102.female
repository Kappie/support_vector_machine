A moment of worship to some anti-hero  A who-did-what person with a moment of shine A low life gang banger with nothing to lose Saved some people from a burning building  In a sad attempt for some headline news Don't worship that low life gang banging anti-hero with no love to spread Turn to our God and worship the truth instead Don't cry out in vain for that pain that you feel Don't ask our God why that pain in you is real Just take a moment and ask yourself why Take a moment and think of those people who died Turn to the truth, not some anti-hero with nothing to lose Hoping to make some boring headline news Don't stare at some old TV set, waiting for the next horror to hit  Go outside, see the hate crimes and the people who wont ever admit That for one measly second, a person becomes a star But every star has its moment, and burns out in good time Every person around has committed some crime Don't worship that anti-hero with nothing to lose Living their life to make headline news Worship our God, and the truth you will find That the feelings of scorn that were born inside Will soon go away and will have easily died Flip on the TV set and I promise you will see That same fantasy hero you once worshipped on sight Will have committed some hate crime the very next night Flip on that TV set and I promise you will see It was an anti-hero with nothing to lose Still hoping to make some headline news.
