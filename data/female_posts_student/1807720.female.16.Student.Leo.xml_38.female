After drivers ed the lady I well didn't like very much and well I am not too good at driving.  Everyone is always talking about "Oh I want to drive" and "oh driving is so easy."  Well it bothers me cause I find it really difficult to learn how to drive and well I feel the pressure to drive, and get my license and stuff.  I feel pressure but I know deep down that is not what I want right now.  Just this morning I did not want to wake up thinking about that stuff but I did, dumb dreams.  I guess they really are a reflection of the conscience.  Oh and Travis asked me today if I wanted to do something friday so of course I told him sure.  I mean why not try something out.  I have nothing to loose, afterall Alex did not turn out to good.  Well I have to go eat supper and then I have some major studying to do for chem.  I need to boost the average and I know that I can do this test.  Note to self: You can do it Vanessa!  You can do anything!
