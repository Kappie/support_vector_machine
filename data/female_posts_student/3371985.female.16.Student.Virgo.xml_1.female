But anyways the SFX were cool! Then yesterday i watched   The Chronicles of Riddick™   *waaahhh* VIin Diesel's soo sexy!!!! But i didn't get to finish the film. Kasi po i was looking for someone to come with yesterday kaso di pwede si Rosa Isabel. Shermie wasn't replying. But in the middle of the movie my phone beeped. Twas Shermie! She said sorry coz she left her phone at home and she was at her mom's office. She asked kung pwedeng syang humabol and she did. So i didnt get to finish the film. But twas ayz. Its better naman to be with friends e.. besides the man beside me was creeping me out. Parang may gagawin kakaiba. Natraumatize na ko a ganyan e! Before i watched Mulan with my mom and bro. I was seated at the seat near the aisle. Then i man stood beside me, first i wasn't bothered then napansin ko may hawak sya!     OH MY GAWD THE MAN WAS MASTURBATING BESIDE ME!!!!!    *waaaahhhh* We invited Chantel to come to SM but took back her answer. Apparantly her friend has a gig on Megamall and she's going there. Nagtampo ko syempre. It's been such a long time na huli namin nakasama si Chantel. But then again she has her own life. So i leave you guys with a copy of me and Shermie's pictures at SM. ciao! ü
