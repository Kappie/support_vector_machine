he's the only 1 in this house who understands how psychotic and unreasonable aunt cheryl really is. i couldnt believe it when he told me about how she always twists things so its somehow ur fault. i thought it was just me. but after he's gone, it will b only me. abi's her little princess who can do no wrong, she only yells at timmy when he deserves it, and she has my uncle right under her thumb. but me, im the perfect 1 4 her 2 take out all her frustrations on. i came 2 her when i was young enuff, young enuff 2 b retaught evrything, or so she thought. so she decided 2 go the hardest on me bcuz, between me and my brother, i was the only one young enuff 4 her 2 b able 2 change. so she decided 2 take out all her anger toward r mother on me. i not only had 2 b completely responsible 4 myself, i had 2 b responsible 4 evrything abi and timmy did, and even my brother. but now im 17, and i havent conformed yet 2 the perfect daughter she always wanted me 2 b, so shes desperate. so now she finds things that i hadnt the least bit of control over and somehow makes it my fault. i have so much more responsibility than my brother, and thats only cuz she had long since given up on ever changing him. so she's come 2 c him as a parasite, taking everything from her and giving nothing back. taking her time, hopes, and money from her, and not caring. but that isnt it. he's tried 2 change. he changed so much, but it wasnt good enuff 4 her. nothing ever is. but its ok. i agree w/ her that theres nothing else she can do 4 him. hes 22, and he needs 2 make it on his own. i just wish it didnt have 2 b that way. i didnt realize how much i've come 2 like him since he moved in a few years ago. not like i ever didnt like him b4. but we were younger then, and sibling rivalry was definitely an issue. but now, things r different. we're both older, and i have the brother i always wanted, but never thought i would have. we understand eachother a lot more. sometimes, we're the only ones who understand eachother. and we talk about stuff and do stuff 2gether, and i dont feel like such a pest like i did when we were younger. im gonna miss it. it was good while it lasted, i just wish it didnt have 2 end. but i guess i should b glad. i got 2 experience all sides of the spectrum. i got 2 b the younger sister 4 most of my childhood. then i moved here and i was the older sister. then my bro moved in and now im the middle child. but i guess now its back 2 bing the older sister. not evry1 gets 2 experience all sides of it like that. but i have 2 say, i think i definitely enjoyed bing the younger sister. i used 2 wonder wut it would have been like if my little bro had survived, and i could b the big sister. i told myself that i would never treat him the way jim treated me, and i would take him everywhere w/ me and not just cuz mom told me 2. and he would look up 2 me just like i look up 2 jim. but its just a dumb old fantasy. and now i realize that it was better this way. not only was i the baby, but i was my dad's only child, and he gave me evrything he could 4 12 years of my life. and i wouldnt trade that 4 nething. mayb he wasnt always the best parent, but he was always there when i needed him. and i wouldnt have wanted 2 share that w/ nebody, not even my own brother. so i guess evrything does happen 4 a reason. so i can only hope this will eventually turn out ok 2. it has 2... well there it is, everything thats running through my mind 2night. and i've worked myself in2 tears. y did i have 2 bring all this out? im crying 4 stuff now that i havent cried 4 in a long time...
