My half was a little burned yes but in actuality I didn't mind.  I'm that girl that purposely burns her hotdogs over an open flame because I think they taste just that much better.  I got that from my mom.  But since I don't have a car right now... or a wallet... which I will explain momentarily, I had to make myself lunch today and since i was out of just about everything... I had to actually cook my lunch today.  I broiled some salmon last night with a little olive oil and a little lemon pepper... and I just finished it... OH MY GOD it was good.  Salmon is easy I know.  But I am always in awe when I don't screw up a dish.  You are talking to the girl who managed to almost close her mother's throat after putting two cups of Baking Soda in her sugar cookies... (DAMN COSTCO'S LARGE CONTAINERS!)  I am thinking I need to make a chicken dish tonight.  Maybe some chicken parmesean without the pasta...
