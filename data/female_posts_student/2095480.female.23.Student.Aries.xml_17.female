How long does this take? I'm not so good at traditional dating -- never had practice at it.   Second, apparently  Rick  thought I snipped at him. I didn't mean to if I did. I was just like "well, ok, I thought I would give you a call and see if you could hang out but it seems that you have made plans already." If I were to "snip" the whole world would know.  Third, had a chat with  Sam  tonight about a number of topics, including but not limited to senior recitals, receptions, actions, words, feelings, friends, exes. The more I get to know him the more I wish I had made an effort befriend him earlier in college. He has alot of good things to say. To him I say "Long time actions speak louder than short term words, so don't stress."  Fourth, had a quick but meaningful dinner with  Miranda  and  Rick . He was much quieter than usual. Don't know why.... strange. I guess he is in a quiet mode today, I have those occasionally.   Fifth, it seems that I have truely broken  Andy's  heart. He commented that  Beth  was urging him to ask me to the formal. I was shocked that she was trying to interfere, and responded with a "are you serious?" and "why does she keep interfering?". However, being that we were chatting via AOL AIM the connotation was completely lost, he took it as I had no interest in him at all, which of course, then upset him and we had a few harsh words said. That is why I do not like using IM as a primary source of conversation. I don't know if I could have gone to the formal with him, I just don't know. First of all, I have other possibilties, second, I do have that huge CIP (Center for International Programs) event that night, and third, the more I talk to Andy the more he seems totally depressed and he surely acts like the world is out to get him. This bothers me because he is a nice guy and the world really isn't out to get him. So, I worry about him - alot. I'm not worried in a "he is going to show up to school and blow everyone away" type of worry, but rather a "he does have alot going for him why isn't he responding to it better?".  I know that I absolutely crushed him in that I am not dating him - I'm sorry Andy. You need to take care of yourself before anyone else - and please, please, take this as concern from me - and nothing else.  That is all for now really. I'm just confused and why everyone is just being weird. Hopefully things will improve tomorrow.   Now would be a good time for a quote on confusion, but I don't have one right now...
