AYE? im super pumped for camping!!1 i leave on sunday and i cant wait to go... i just hope that we dont have a moody max on our hands because that would suck and if he does get moody then he can just sit in the tent all day and listen to his beloved ipod because i dont want him to ruin my time there... well i must be going now... bye
