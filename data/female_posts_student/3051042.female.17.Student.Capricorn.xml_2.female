Since it went by so fast I'll explain in incomplete thoughts.  Woke up. Sat on ass. Got off of ass. Listened to my mom bitch about break up. Dad walked in. Expected him to bitch about break up. Turned stereo down to talk to Dad. Dad turned stereo back up. Dad danced to Sunshine Underground. Looked at Dad weird. Dad does what Joce and I call, "Big Man Bounce." Dad does what Joce and I call, "Everybody Was Kung-Fu Fighting." Slammed head on keyboard a few times. Burned Dad CD w/ Sunshine Underground on it so he could dance somewhere other than my room. Dad left before receiving "Dad Mix." Threw on some Zero 7 because Dad hates it. Laughed. Went to work. Made sure Sebastian's shift was covered. Sebastian's shift was covered. Joce calls during "Gay Alex" conversation with 'Wrench.' Joce and I go to A2. Joce and I walk. Joce and I shop. Joce and I get coffee at Espresso Royale. Have expect Max to stumble in. Wonder if Max is dead. Assume Max is dead. Hope Max is dead. Wipe the dry-erase board in my head clean. Walk to parking structure. Get in car. Pinball Pete's. Have a blast. Talk herb. Head to Henrietta Fahrenheit. Buy nothing. Go to Mother Flechers. Haggle over price. Get what I want. LIKE A RHINESTONE COWBOY! Play taxi. Go to B's. B is perma-stoned. People passed out all over B's house. Leave "Dad Mix" at B's. Mom's walking the dog. Go to schooner Cove to meet up with Mom. Get a call. Mom says dog is in car. Mom is stoned. I am stoned. Sebastian's stoned. B is stoned. Girls on B's couch are stoned. Everyone is stoned. Go home. Change. Sebastian shouldn't work for a florist. Refuse to put horrendously ugly flower arrangement in my room. Leave it on dining room table. I LOOK HOT! Damn, I'm a sexy bitch. Purposely smuge the ?-mark on cheek. Drive to A2. Drive seems to take forever. Walk out of parking structure and into someone's student film. Walk to get coffee. Walk to get books. Walk to get music. Walk to walk. Diag is fun. Blisters mysteriously appear on toes. Walk to car. Sit on the roof for awhile. Wanted my poetry book. Get in car. Wait in traffic jam. Hit S. University. B-line to Sabastian's house. Get major headache. Drive seems to take forever, again. Finally get home. Jason is in my basement. Walk up stairs as pissed off as possible. Wonder why Jason is spending time with Mom. Wonder why Jason is spending time with my brother. Slam door shut. Shut off all recollection that Jason is still in my house. Blast music. Make it sound like I'm having fun. Really drowning in a sea of thoughts. And I'm here. I'm annoyed. I'm pissed. I'm over-reacting. I'm wondering who's going to read this. I'm aching. I'm slamming my head on my keyboard (for the second time today). I'm broke. I'm stupid. This is lame.  So there's my entire day... congratulations.... to me.... I've bored you to sleep. Congratulations... to you... you've now wasted you life reading this. I'm beginning to realize why I'd stopped blogging.  I'm going to check my e-mail, like that's going to give me hope.
