Due to the the fact that it's $5000 and my mom has her back problem right now..she's bedridden right now ( i don't feel like getting into that right now) but i also cancelled it because i've been away from home for so long that i've gotten really homesick, so it would erally suck having to go back home and then leave again. but ANYWAYS. I come home june 22nd. I'm still enjoying it here....but i'm just homesick. i miss my home. i miss my bed. i miss my shimmy. i miss my car ( haha) i miss my friends!   but i have to go now.  JENNAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is my friend.
