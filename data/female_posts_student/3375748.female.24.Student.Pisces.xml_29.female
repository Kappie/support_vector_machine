Tuesday was a raining day, but we still wanted to go. We took Lemon with us too. However, we had to leave Lemon in the car because she got so wild in the woods. When we just got there, it was still raining. We had to eat our riceballs inside of the house. There were around 10 young people who looked like teenagers, but they were drinking beers. After we ate our riceballs, we went to mountain climbing. And, we met a father with two daughters. Both of his daughters are so Cute!!! The younger one is really cute. We were climbing together, and they had a lot of fun with Toshi and Masa. Masa was so funny, and they called him the "Monkey-boy". Toshi had long talk with the father, and Masa and I just played with them. It was a good time. Those kids are too cute to grow up.   上个星期二，我，敏和正一起去野炊。一大早，敏和正就开始做饭团，做好了后我们就出发去我们的目的地。开车大概40分钟的一个公园，我们还带着柠檬一起去哦。可惜，柠檬到了野外就开始发狂了，到处乱跑，我们怕她跑不见，只有把她放进车子里。刚到公园的时候还在下雨，我们就去了一个像屋子的亭子里，里面很大，而且有10多个人在。他们开起来挺像高中生的，但是都在喝啤酒。我们就在离他们最远的地方开始吃饭团，还不错。吃完后，我们决定去爬山。在去的途中我们遇见一个带着两个女儿的父亲。那两个女儿超级可爱，特别是小的那个。我们就这样相遇，然后一起爬山。蛮好玩的，她们实在是太可爱了。  urlLink     urlLink
