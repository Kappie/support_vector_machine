She did a tarot reading on me, we lit a white candel for protection and purity and then i picked seven cards from the spread. I'm not saying what the cards said but, i guess some good stuff is going to happen but, yet some stuff about loneliness(what else is new)...so anyway, we went to the beach in Venice and I got a bit of a tan but, not really, im so pale its unbelievable. Not as white as ryan tho lol but close. I'm going to call Franny tonight (its her b-day)..plus i want to talk to her anyway. She moved to her new place on saturday.-i think- but anyway, there were some uber hot guys at the beach...yummy, but um, ya ANYWAY. hehe, Yes, new Degrassi starts June 4th and i guess it'll be good. I mean, Manny gets pregnant (supposedly if they show that episode) but i know what happend oh ya, and i couldn't believe it when i read it. I swear i'll never be able to watch One Tree Hill the same way again. Ryan totally ruined it lol, but it was bad timing cuz the show got alil too dramatic lol. But ryan just thought it was funny, therefor he started making me crack up while watching the show so, i really can't watch drama shows the same way. Crystal was on Entertainment Tonight!!!! ya, and i didn't get to see it cuz grama didn't tell us!! grrrrrr.....she was on there for 5 mins talking about how she's gonna be the new model for Lane Bryant. (HUGE clothing store) great job for her. I'm really happy for her, i mean, she's not a stick anymore, she's healthy and she's getting these major jobs.  Ok well im gonna go...just catching up oh ya and the move Day after Tomarrow is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
