I'm planning on trying that, this November. But I'm also using the 1,500 words a day meter for THIS month, and August, too :) So far I've only got 9,700-something words, but that's in four days. heh. 1 r sp33d 7yp3r. w00t!     It's not the epic story, it's a different one. I got way too bogged down with the Chisien outline, and it just got tedious. This time, I've tried a different tactic: write the 'idea' like a blurb (vague, but exciting and  going somewhere ), and then write how the ending will work out, and every time you get an idea write it down. Whether you think it'll work or not. So, I've got I think 5 documents, all for the same book :P One's the plot document, the other's just to keep track of the family (I'll explain that later), then there's the glossary, then there's the log (how many words I write a day, and the total for each day), and finally the story itself. So far, it's going really well! The site  urlLink www.hollylisle.com  helped a lot: candy bar scenes was a good idea, as was just 'having the end in mind.' Not an outline, per se, but just knowing how, eventually, it's going to end. That helped. It allows a lot of freedom. Holly Lisle also gave me the idea of 'scenes,' which makes it easier to keep track of progress and where I am. I've always been  aware  of scenes, of course, but now I'm actually using them consciously.     NaNoWriMo also helped because it got me to realize that, mwahaha,  QUANTITY  over  QUALITY . My entire first chapter needs a rewrite, because my style changed in the middle of the second chapter, and I like it better now, but I'm gonna wait until I'm further on. Let's get the  story  out, and then fix it up, ne? :) Hence keeping track and making a log. Looking back on your progress is a real good motivation.     So far, my biggest problem is POV *sigh* Too omniscient! Must... focus... on... Taj!! :) I'm working on it. I'm even thinking of switching to first-person, but I've never entirely liked that POV because you're restricted to your character's voice. My main character happens to be only 12 years old (at this point in the story), so that wouldn't work. I like describing settings, surroundings, etc., and first-person doesn't usually allow that kind of freedom. I haven't had much difficulty actually coming up with the plot (in fact, so far it's all been winding together quite nicely, with very little direction from me at all -- yay!), so that's good. Another big problem, though, is just sitting down and writing. Sometimes I'll just sit there and stare at the screen and agonize over how to start. Usually, once I actually  do  start, I'll end up liking it. It's just taking that first plunge. As I said, though, my  first  first plunge wasn't too good :P I'm starting to cringe at the thought of that first chapter... heh.     Oh, right! I was supposed to explain why I have to keep track of the family. Well, this is mostly because the family's pretty big.     Oh, all right. I'll explain more ^^;;; Taj is a princess. Her dad, the Emperor, has five wives. He had about thirty kids, too. So, it's hard to keep track of them all ^^;; I've only named the wives, the dad, Taj, and maybe three of her siblings. But, I just wanted to make sure nobody started switching brothers and sisters, or ages, or training (all imperial kids are 'dedicated' to a certain caste, like the arts, craftsmanship, etc.). So I've got a seperate document for that. Yeah.     I won't go on to explain the entire story unless you ask me to :)     A is insisting that I have other things to talk about. Other than the fact I've only written like 700 words because today is music day and I'm being swamped with practice, there's not much going on. My harp lessons are going surprisingly well, considering I play the harp once a week (at the lesson). My piano lessons aren't going so well, but I'm planning on going over the songs before I leave. They're  hard songs! They're grade 7! I'm still in a grade 6 mindset!!     That's about it, though. Have fun! *gives cookies to A and A*
