No words were exchanged between the two, but right as they passed, they slapped hands in mid-air! It was crazy!  When we were taking the AP practice test, Se√±or comes into O'Grady's (he had to teach 8th period) and goes "Keep going, I love you guys!" I was like "Dude, you're going to get fired!"  Ann and Megan and Trisha picked flowers and gave them to the Chair Nazi, I laughed really hard. Now I am procrastinating. Bye bye jar jar.   P.S. All that bear wanted was some s'mores!
