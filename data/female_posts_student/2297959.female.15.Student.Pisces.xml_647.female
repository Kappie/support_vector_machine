APPARENTLY my brother talked to kevin williams online last night and now a movie romance is gonna play at his little concert at jordan's. this is strange and i am greatly confused and surprised by this occurance. so now i will be attending and it will prove to be interesting. i finished michael moore's book last night and it was superb. it was interesting and well written. i wish i could vote. and also, if bush gets re-elected i may be moving to sweden. i decided that a bit ago but my parents won't let me. i saw a gorgeous hippie bus yesterday and i pet it and kissed it (not directly). it had a stove in it. it was tan. then today i saw yet another hippie bus and today this one was a spectacular bright blue but it wasn't the camper type. neither were for sale. i desperately want one. they are seriously one of the coolest cars on this planet. i think just about any car from the 60's and 70's are amazing. although i have seen some ugly ones. but anyways, enough about cars i will never get. i am going to talk my mother into taking in my pictures because i would enjoy looking at them. i love taking pictures because they are such great and easy ways to show your life to others. i think it is really neat that someone invented them. i wish i could be so smart as to invent something as great as pictures. i'm just so happy that i can blog again!! i missed it so! i got2 cool shirts on the mission trip, one says "youthworks be like jesus 04" on the front and then on the back i got people to sign it. the other one is orange and says "possible" on the front and on the back says something along the lines of "for nothing is impossible for those who believe"-jesus. but i can't remember exactly what it says. oh well. we had devotionals every morning outside and after i finished the questions i decided to read luke. i'm not sure why but i felt like it. so i read it every day and i'm a little more than halfway finished. my goal is to read the whole bible by the end of high school so hopefully i can do that. it's a tough goal but i really want to. so i'm going to attempt to. i don't think i will read it in order though. i dunno it just depends.my new favorite verse- 1 Corinthians 15:10 "But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect." there's another one i like- luke 1:37. it is simply "for nothing is impossible with God". i adore psalms and proverbs because they are pretty and poetic. so moving on, i am going to try and post more thoughts of mine. since mostly i just say "well i went here and there adn talked to so-and-so." i thnk that is boring and you probably don't care anyway. so in conclusion, i enjoy blogging and will be blogging more often.
