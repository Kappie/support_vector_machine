My dogs are afraid of thunder, it's the funniest thing to see these two big dogs (a chocolate lab and golden retriever) jumping every time there is a clap of thunder.  I went back over my blog and I need to use more paragraphs, it all looks like one long essay.A little hard to read. Sorry about that.  I can hear my step-mom laughing upstairs with my step-brother.It's a strange sound.I wonder if anybody knows what it feels like to be the unwanted-ok maybe not unwanted but certainly unwelcomed-child.He was gone all last week at a soccer camp at UNC.And, I've noticed this before but more so this time, the step-mom decided to forego any parental or maternal duties for that week. She didn't cook dinner once, she would come home and go straight up to her room without even saying hello, she hardly ever acknowledged my sister or me, and completely closed up. I know it is natural for a step-parent to feel more love towards their own child, but does she have to make it so damn obvious?  I try to do my best to please her, to make her proud of me.I have given her no reason not to be proud of me or to love me. I get good grades, don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, I don't stay out past curfew, my friends are good people, I do my chores more often than not, I clean my room, I shuttle my siblings wherever they want to go, I usually only have to be asked once to do something, and I don't deliberately try to hurt her or my dad with my actions or words.It just seems like I will  never  be good enough for her.Never.Nothing I do or say can change that, I am sub-par and always will be to her.I wonder why my dad married her.The following thought may sound a bit hypocritical so beware.  In all honesty though, I really can't imagine living without her.I think she makes my dad happy and I really love my step-siblings.If I were given the choice of whether or not my parents were to get a divorce, I would probably say no.I love her because she is family (sort of) but I can't stand her otherwise.
