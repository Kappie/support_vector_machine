    Kelly, My buddy, My friend, May have to move to Kentucky. Although we haven't been friends for very long, I still love her and am grateful that she's with me.          She Lives with her grandparents and they have been fighting, and the thing is, If they do infact get a divorce, She will have to move to Kentucky. There are the possibilitys that she can live with her mom, or if worst comes to worst, and I hope they don't, She may come live with me ((depending on how open my parents are to that subject, but she's a friend in trouble, and I'm suspecting if they were needed, that they would come in handy)). And if infact that did happen, and I doubt it, She would be open to a whole new world of problems. I really care about Kelly, and know that this really hard on her, So Please, Please, Please, Pray for her, and that things work out alright.
