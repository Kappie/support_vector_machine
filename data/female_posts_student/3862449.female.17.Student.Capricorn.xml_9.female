Light curves graph time versus magnitude, so they show if the star varies in brightness at all throughout the viewing period. If the curve is relatively straight, it is a normal star. If it has regular waves, it could be a variable star. Sometimes the curves have irregular shapes, and this usually just a result of experimental error. Most of the curves i looked at yesterday were pretty normal, but i did find one that looks like it could be a variable star. I looked up the coordinates on Aladin and Simbad, and it seems as if no one really knows anything about this star already, so i might have found a previously unknown variable. This would be really cool. To be sure, i have to wait for another clear night so we can get more measurements of this star using different light filters. Then, if it is truly and variable, it can be reported!
