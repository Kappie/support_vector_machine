Yup, that's how it usually goes. I've had this happen so many times. I would be fighting with a person and they would know exactly what to say to piss me off and hit me the hardest. And the people you least expected to ever say the one thing that would hurt the hardest,  always do ... Another thing, I hate how people speak out of anger. Because usually speaking out of anger leads then to people saying the worst possible things. Also, I hate it when you give people a second chance and they  throw it right back at you ...
