Sleep: What they didn't want you to know  	Sleep is a topic which pans out to be more controversial then any of us would like to believe; however that is precisely what I plan to discuss. This paper will cover all aspects of sleep which I deem important for the student to know, primarily it’s importance to school through the effects of sleep deficit, society’s attitude toward sleep; the misconceptions and false assertions as well as the connotations these imply. Most importantly, I’ll discuss ideas to help change your sleeping habits if you feel touched by the information I’m providing, followed by my own reaction.  	Amongst the priorities accentuated by society, sleep as one is almost non-existent. With the integration of electric lighting and the progression of the twenty-four hour society, our biological cues for rest are often offset by a constant barrage of stimuli. Traditionally productivity was only practical in the daylight, hence providing a natural barrier for our body’s to align to. The recent availability of round-the-clock services and entertainment combined with the increasing value and desire for time however has changed this, more then ever discipline is required to meet the demands our body’s face us with. This is true of relaxation and nutrition, but I speak namely of sleep. The irony here lies in that while trying to attain the highest standard of industriousness, society as a whole has sacrificed the importance of sleep- thereby hindering the potency and effectiveness of that productivity.  	 This reality has manifested itself in tragic ways. Such disasters as the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and the Exxon-Valdez oil-spill have been attributed to sleep loss, as well as the near melt-down of the 3 Mile Island nuclear reactor. On sleep related accidents the American Psychological Association states: 	 “The NCSDR estimated that the total societal costs- including such indirect economic costs as loss of productivity resulting from disability or premature demise- might be 10-fold greater, approximately 150 billion. A recent publication (Leger, 1994) provided detailed calculations of the total costs of accidents owing to the basis of 1988 statistics. Leger’s conclusion was the economic impact of sleepiness-related accidents in the United States during 1988 was between $43.15 and $56.02 billion.” (Carskadon and Taylor, 1997)	  	Pressman and Orr state that on average, one hundred people die on the road every day across America due to sleepiness related accidents. The results of a sleep study (Hirshkowitz, Moore, and Minhoto, 1997) showed that, while compensating for disease and age, people who generally got less then 6 hours of sleep or more then 9 hours per night suffered a 30% higher death rate then those who slept a normal 7-8 hours a night. The same was true even for people claiming to have no health problems.  	The monetary cost on society is apparent, but to understand why this occurs, or moreover, how sleep loss directly affects you and the way you live your life (and therefor it’s impact on others), it would help to understand the changes your body undergoes while under a sleep debt. The most scientifically measurable alterations (Walsh and Lindblom, 1997) include changes in the autonomic nervous system; your body temperature drops, blood pH lowers, and blood pressure rises 25% in prolonged cases. A dropping respiratory rate parallels a lowered oxygen consumption, which hinders exercise. A shift in cerebral blood flow has been attributed to a shift in metabolism, this also alters the balance of hormone production which affect mood.   	The noticeable changes occur with mood and attitude, people suffering sleep loss are generally more fatigued physically and emotionally as well as lacking vigor. When deprived of REM sleep, numerous research shows a decline in concentration, creative problem solving ability and intellectually divergent thinking (Hirshkowitz et al., 1997). When this research was done in children, this translated into the symptoms of ADHD (Lippincott/Willians  Wilkins, 2003). Short-term to long-term memory transfer also suffers (Hirshkowitz et al., 1997), which may explain why sleep deprived subjects in another study had severe difficulty learning and executing new tasks when compared to normal sleepers. These all fit very poorly into school and work performance. Even more disturbing is the impairing effect it has on motor skills, coordination, reaction time and judgement. An international study on CNN.com found that sleep deprived drivers performed worse then drunk drivers on test courses. The same study states that 16-60% of road accidents involve sleep loss. Combine this with cell phone usage, food on the go, and the stress/anxiety/depression which often causes or is caused by sleep deprivation, and you have a dangerous road situation... especially in California, as they don’t follow the law anyway.  	These impairments seriously detriment any task which requires an amount of thought or interaction to carry out, for example, anything you do of importance during the day. Social interaction- your relationships, making a living, carrying out responsibility of any kind; feeding your animals, remembering errands, making appointments, there is no end to the list. School would be near the top, as your ability to learn and process information- especially in college, largely depends on your brain’s higher intellectual functions. The overwhelming majority of evidence has suggested that sleep serves as your body’s primary process for retaining new information. School is not the end of it though. A student’s lifestyle and schedule are typically chaotic in nature, often balancing work with school with family, apart from social and personal life. One could argue that sleep is the single most controllable factor for success which cements all these together, and often it is the first healthy habit to give way, perpetuating stress and an overall less than enjoyable quality of life. All of these can hinder performance in one’s endeavors; be it school, relationships, career, or hobbies.  	Fixing sleep problems can be simple or extremely difficult. Many times conditioned sleep abnormalities exist long after the cause of their existence depart, leaving or creating separate health problems of their own (Spielman and Glovinsky, 1997). The problem could also be due to a sleeping disorder, which may include having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, waking up and or/ quality of sleep. The only true way to know would be to meet with a sleep specialist. Family MD’s on average receive less then 2 hours of education regarding the diagnosis of sleep disorders as well as the medication of them (Carskadon and Taylor, 1997); they more often then not regard sleeping problems as symptoms of depression or anxiety, which may delay proper diagnosis as sleep disorders often exist independently and cause depression themselves. This is due to a lack of information carry-over of recent research about sleep into the widespread public eye and medical education. The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research refers to this as a “pervasive failure of knowledge transfer” (Carskadon et al., 1997). For the purposes of keeping this paper concise and effective, the information I’ve acquired regarding the self-assessment and behavior modification techniques for sleep related issues will be distributed in the form of handouts to the class.  	The above information would have helped me immensely had I been so well informed during highschool, where many of my classmates and I suffered from chronic sleep deprivation throughout the greater duration of the years. The act of staying up to complete homework was often regarded as noble by our teachers, who remained as ignorant to the real life ramifications of sleep loss as the students themselves. It bothers me that the school system has not taken serious measures to address sleep loss via the education of school staff and students, because whether due from poor time management or poor habit, it is a silent killer among students who often become burned out from the inability to cope with multiple assignments. When one considers the similarities between a sleep deprived person and drunkenness, one has to wonder why the school system doesn’t aware itself to these problems but has policies against students coming to class drunk. A projection by the NCSDR (Carskadon et a., 1997) estimates by the year 2010 79 million Americans will be affected by sleeping problems. Age- like cancer- is a major factor in determining one’s susceptibility to sleep problems. If the current generation proceeds with present sleep habits, I would imagine this number to mushroom as time goes on. It is my assertion that social education on sleep would be extremely beneficial in the national health interest, as it stems to all tiers and facets of society. I hope this knowledge will help the students of this class.   “Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” - Ben Franklin   Here are my references... because they took just as long to format as it took to write the paper in the first place      References       	Staff and Wire Reports, (2000).
