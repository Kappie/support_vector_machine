Like I was close with her, and she was always really nice to me and all but these people were like with her every day and stuff. I dunno, I cried though. I hate funerals. And like, theres like nothing to say ya know? Like what do you say to someone who just lost someone they love so much like that ya know? I told Dino and Patty Ann that she was in Heaven and I know shes gonna cause a ruckas up there. Then, after we said goodbye to her, we went to see Grandpa Mario. It was nice to see his grave. It's really nice. It's like this angle like woman playin the piano and underneath is like a few notes. It's nice. But... then when I was in the car on the way home Deb called and she came to my house around 1:30 and then we hadda go to drivers ed and now I'm gonna chill out and then Erica is gonna come ova and we are gonna chill and then I'm gonna go to bed cause I have a meet tomrrow. Fun huh? I think I'm goin to Albert's party tomrrow so, that should be fun. Okay, peace x0x00x0x0x
