Sometimes I love him to death and sometimes it's just like an "Oh my God, you're such a GUY!!!" type of thing.  And that probably made very little sense to you because you ARE a guy, but it's really the little things that take us by surprise that we really love.  Oh well... boys are stupid, throw rocks at them.  I went to sleep when I got home and just woke up with that phrase in my head, so I had to put that one out there.  I just wish he would open up to me, you know?  It's been a month (and a day, not that I'm counting) now and I feel like we've just barely progressed from where we were a month ago.  And then there's the whole thing with what's going on in his life that he won't share with me.  I'm just so frustrated.  Why won't guys talk?  This isn't a hard concept.  Ok, I'm done for now and I'm quite sure you didn't understand half of it, but that's ok.
