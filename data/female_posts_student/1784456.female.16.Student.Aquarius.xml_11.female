Izzy Bird  Upside down, Inside out, Dancing around, Prancing about, It skips, It sings, It larks about, Give it a prod and you'll hear it shout "Get off! Go far away and there you stay!"  They scream, They slither, All as strange, And weird as each other. They;re red, And blue, And purple, And black. Whatever you do, Don't look back.  By Kes Sims!  Now wasn't that good? (no comment) Wahay! I should become a professional one day oh wait- I am one! Nohohoho!  (Unlike some :P)
