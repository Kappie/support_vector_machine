After the tragedy, I think Singapore and the doctors need such an encouragement to motivate themselves harder. And what's more? The Korean baby girls are ssssssoooooo kawaii!!! (*_*) They are so fair and chubby. I did not even noticed that they were joined near the spine in the papers until I read the news. So cute, how I wish I was like them (I mean not joined lah!). I was like a boy in my baby photos....
