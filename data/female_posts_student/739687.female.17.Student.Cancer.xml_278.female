Tomorrow I have the Chemistry letter K test after school, and then I have kickboxing that evening. Then Wednesday is Girl's Night Out, Thursday I'm hoping to do my second interview for Algebra, and Friday I'm going to the Door in Dallas, because  THE BUFFINGTONS!!!!!!!!!  are playing. Quite a week ahead I suppose. Fun.  Well, I can't think of much else to say. Keep yourselves busy, crazies.
