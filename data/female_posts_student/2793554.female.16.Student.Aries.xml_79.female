Today is Melissas birthday. Everybody wish her a happy birthday. Shes 17! Woohoo, she can go see rated R movies! And uh. Drive still?  Ugh. So bored. So procrastinating. I hate how at the end of the year all your teachers are all "OH NO! we forgot to teach half the curriculum, lets give them all the homework we can and cram it all into one week and drive them INSANE!"  Stupid school. ONLY 9 MORE DAYS! YAAAAAY!  bleh.   ~abby
