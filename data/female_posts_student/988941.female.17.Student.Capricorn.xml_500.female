I've just got back from my mum's work- I went to see if Harry Potter was delivered but it wasn't; so I've come back annoyed and I'm now munching through a box oc chocolates to make me feel better, lol. Probably just end up feeling sick. Oh well! Anywho, weather looks a bit grim today, cloudy, threatening to rain, and where I am it smells like a bonfire, yet again! Yuck mocha. *bins current chocolate* I dunno what to do now. I was hoping to read hp, but it isnt here so I'm annoyed, as previously stated. I suppose there's always the tennis to watch, but the minute I turn on the tv it'll start raining in wimbledon and they'll have to abandon play, it always happens when I sit down to watch! Anyway we know what'll happen: One of the Williams sisters will win the ladies, Tin Henman will do a dramatic crash out in the quater finals, and some obscure russian will win. Probably. well like I said, hope everything went ok today, I can't wait for my indcutvion day next week, hopefully it'll be good! talk yo y'all later now
