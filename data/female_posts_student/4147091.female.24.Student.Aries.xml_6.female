Now that injury and well, university, have pulled me away from the one thing that provided me with absolute joy, I have become an armchair athlete (and occasional runner).  So I spend the last 2 weeks on my time in Newfoundland watching the greatest sporting event in the world, the Olympics.  I was up at 8:30am to watch the beginning of the morning session os CBC's broadcast and even though it was cycling and beach volleyball, I sat rivitted to the tv screen.  I learned today that the 'group' of followers in a cycling roadrace is called the...crap I"ve forgotten already.  But 10 minutes ago I swear I knew it.  I learned that this year in Beach Volleyball there is no side out...very different from the volleyball I played in high school.  And the very fact that the number 2 in the Canadian womens team is 5'5, gives me hope at 5'6 that I am not short.  But i think we have lost the Olympic spirit.  None of my friends really care the its on.  And they have resigned themselves to the fact that I will be a hermit for the next 2 weeks.  Even those people that I feel should, at the very academic level understand and appreciate the Olympics, do not.  Like my Classics minor friend, who also majored in Philosophy...pre-Decartes philosophy.  Even I, who took only one Classics course in my undergrad, and it being the intro to greek civilization, can appreciate the history of the games.  but alas, I stand alone, curled up in front of my tv, cheering on the Canadian team.  I also feel the need to inform everyone that the first commerical I saw this morning, at 8:30am was a commerical for the new Exorcist movie.  I was so doe eyed that I didn't realize waht it was at first...and ofcourse CBC weren't going to broadcast such a commerical at 8:30am on a Saturday morning! But they did and I gave a little yelp and changed the channel.  Oh boy, its going to be a long Olympics!
