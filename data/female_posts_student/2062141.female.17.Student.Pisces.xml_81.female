Why is your purse a dog? Why are you so crazy!? Answer: Cause I'm just cool like that I guess. Get freaking OVER it. I know I'm unique, but I can't be anyone else. No one appreciates that I guess. What's wrong with standing out? Maybe I like to be interesting. Maybe I don't like how boring people are considered normal. Maybe I'm just too weird. Shit.
