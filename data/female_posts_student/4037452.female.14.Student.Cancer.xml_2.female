I feel like such a snob, and at the same time a sl*t.      I can't help it. I think I may be a very dangerous carrier of some new yet-undiscovered syndrome. Like 'Chronic Boy Lead-Onnerer Who Won't Stop When She Should And Is Stupidly Self-Absorbed.' Yeah, that's the one. I wonder if it's hereditary? Goodness knows I'd hate my future children to have it too...      I wonder if I will like my children. I know that sounds horribly  wrong , but I wonder if I'll be close to them, or if I'll suffer some form of post-natal depression or  something !! I can just imagine myself being really jealous of my children eg. they're smarter/prettier/nicer than me.       I think I'd make a bad mother.      Yes.      I would.      Amelia
