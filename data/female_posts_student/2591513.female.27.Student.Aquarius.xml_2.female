We got him at a pound like 40 minutes away...he is an energetic puppy (A Black Lab mix).  He is too cute and sure does live up to his name Stitch.  Bailey had the honor of naming him.  We wanted him to hook up with Kawaii (not really like that, that would be a funny looking dog...haha) but anyway, it won't happen because Kawaii is a Gay.  I told Jess that it was okay because Stitch will probably be a gay too.  haha  i am saddened by a chain of events involving my immediate family and not so immediate family.  So much miscommunication and carrying grudges makes family unity so difficult.  There are somethings I have to change, like my attitude towards someone (you all know who I am talking about...and no she isn't related to me...thank goodness)...but that is hard when they don't make an effort to be nice.  You know?  Anyway...it will all happen when she grows up and starts showing some respect.  Well the other problem, I won't get into...but know this...money can only take you so far...once money takes you away from your family, it has taken you in the wrong direction.  I will NEVER let money become an issue in my family...not to this extent...and I will NEVER do business with family.  Too many unpredictable things can go wrong and too much to risk....  I hope you all (umm...that would be Leila and Mica...haha) have a good weekend.  I have a butt ton of homework to do.
