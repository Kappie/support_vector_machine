Well, first off, I've enabled comments on here, so if you want, comment away! I'm a littlescared though -I mean, please don't tell me that my life is boring or something like that because believe me, I alreadyknow that, and I really don't need to hear it from other people!    Okay, so here's my good news ... I finally got everything organized into my  Ashden  folder today, and I really had no idea how much I've worked on justplanning this novel out! I'm pretty proud of it, but anyway, that's not my good news. I went onto the  urlLink Nicholas Sparks  web site today because he has this page that tells you how to write a query letter, and it even gives you a sample of one, and so I thought that it would be something interesting to keep in my file. After I printed that out, I started looking at some of the other things on his site while thinking, " This must be so easy and normal for him... " But then I stumpled upon a page where he has notes about writing all of his novels, and I was reading the one about  The Guardian , and it started talking about how hard it was for him to keep writing when he felt like the book was never going to come to an end and how that this was one of the hardest points in his life because he started toloathe writing! I know that probably sounds really sad to all of you, and believe me, it does to me too, but it's also awesome for me to readat the same time because I've felt exactly that way! It's good to know that even famous authors have trouble writing and even hate it sometimes. After writing  Out of the Ordinary , I started to question myself and then I started to question my writing, which then eventually lead to me questioning whether or whether not I even liked to write anymore. By that point I felt horrible because I knew that writing was my passion, and I knew that it was one of the things that I am meant to do with my life, and so feeling like I just flat out didn't like to do it anymore scared me. I didn't think that was normal, but now that I see that even authors like Nicholas Sparks have felt that way,I feel a lot better.   It's a lot of pressure being a writer, more than some people know. For me it's hard because (well, for one thing, I am only 16) many people that I know around here seem to expect me to be famoussome day. At first I, of course, took this as a complement, but it quickly changed to pressure. Someone was saying to me once that they thought that by the time we have our high school reunion I'd have like 100 books published, and well, that just freaked me out! Believe me, I'd much rather go to my high school reunion and have people say, "Hi Jennifer, I've read your BOOK and I loved it!" than "Hi Jennifer, how many books have you written since I last saw you?" That's why I'm working so hard on  Ashden . I've even had a friend at school just nonchalantly come up to me and ask, "Have you written anymore books lately?" I, of course, almost started to laugh, but once I realized that she was actually serious, I kind of didn't know what do say. I guess I said something like, "Well, um, you see, writing novels takes time, you can't just write a novel in a day or a month, and for some people, even a year isn't long enough..." I was just flabbergasted when she asked me that! Do people really think it's that easy - because it's  NOT ! I really don't even think about being famoussomeday - okay, well, maybe I do ...just a little. I mean, oh yeah, that would be nice, but all I really want to do is write the type of unique book that people want to read over and over again. I think that I can do that with Ashden just because of the fact that the more I plan it out, the more I fall in love with it myself. lol You know you're a pretty damn good author when you can make yourself cry by something you write!    Well, that's all for now. lol I had to rave - hope I didn't bore you too much! I'll type later! JKM - OUT!
