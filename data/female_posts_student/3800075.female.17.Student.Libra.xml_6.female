Sometimes I don't think she realizes how many things she has to offer.... She has been my best friend since we met in 6th grade, and she still continues to amaze. don't ever lose that light in your eyes sugar :)  Leslie is one of those peoplewho is radiant in every sense. I remember we used to talk about when everyone would go off in their separate ways, for college and whatknot, and she and I agreed that it would be extremely difficult to make new friends due toour tendency to be shy. However I don't seea problem for her there, I've seen the way people react to her- shes electric. Maybe thats not immediately apparent to her - but every new person wemeet just thinks the world of her- and rightly so. Now I could go on about how pretty her smile is- how bright her eyes shine when shes happy- or how refreshing (and to me, flawless) her sense of humor is, but it would be impossible for me to enclose all of these things in just one blog. So I will just say this- her beauty is unparalleled, and her modesty is shaded only by her personality, which cannot be outshone.
