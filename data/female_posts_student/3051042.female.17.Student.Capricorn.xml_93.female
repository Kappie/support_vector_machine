I was backing up out of the land mine of cars sporadically parked throughout the driveway when I hit ned's car. yes... the benz. go me. i really shouldn't drive anymore. i wasn't even that drunk. maybe it was the vicodin fucking with my perception. but ned told me, "chicks can hit my car and i'll still be on my knees kissing their feet." how odd. at any rate, he moved his car (because he's an asshole of a gentleman) and guided me as i backed up, safely this time.   julian and ned put up a fit for me to stay for awhile longer. i said, 'no.' they were worried that i'd get a DUI. oh fucking well. i gave ned my cell number, and he gave me william's number. i got home safely and called ned to 'check in.' because ned has all of a sudden turned into my father or something... whatever.   my dad talked with me for a few. he didn't seem pissed that i got home so late. but i have work in the morning so i'm outta here. g'night. i'm so numb.
