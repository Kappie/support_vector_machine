It'll last about 3 days looking nice, till i decide it's too high maintance and give up :P.  Am still off work, and tis no fun. I miss it, which is why i know i'm ill lol, AHHHHHHHH!! 2 days till results :/.  Not much to write about, My best mate has gone and left again to go on holiday, but she's back in a week so thats not so bad :P.  Oh and by the time i write my next blog, i'll have whooped gemma's ass at yahoo pool! haha go me :).
