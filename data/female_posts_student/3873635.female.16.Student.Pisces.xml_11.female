Today I played so bad :( I was playing really good the whole week until today. I don't wanna get demoted. So, I'm stressed about that. I need to go hit groundstrokes with someone.  Yesterday was a really good day though. I went to a fun party. I have to look at the good things in life.  I mean tennis was kind of fun today, because we had our annual Mother's Pizza thing. And Caitlin gave me a souviner (can't spell). That was cool.
