It's my only complaint (besides school in general, which is a given). Some of you know what I mean. When you have that person in your life...that person that you can't live with, and you have to try to live without. And I know how to distance myself from that person. Honestly, I'd been kind of a bitch to that person (not that they didn't completely deserve it).  But being like that is always just a phase. And tonight I let my guard down. I let myself smile and be friendly. I let myself sit down and have a conversation. And I was strong about it, and they noticed that. Every time he sees that I'm stronger without him, it draws him back. I don't want him back. I let him run his little 'scam' once, and I'd never go back. But I swear it's hard to doubt someone who can be so genuine. It's just hard to hate them. I have this inner resentment because I know that he's not who he pretends to be. It's like befriending a con-artist. How would you ever really know who they are? You wouldn't. You would only know who they present themselves to you as. I just need to prove that I'm stronger on my own. I need to keep standing my ground. I'm doing a good job. But I almost slid. Almost.  I have to be better than that.  And here is my lesson of the day:  I've learned that you have to be a stronger person than people expect. You have to hold your ground, no matter what. People will only learn to respect you when they realize that you're independent; when they realize that you don't need them, and quite honestly, you don't want them either. I don't need anyone.  Especially not those type of people.  Of course...I still need YOU, crazies. :-P
