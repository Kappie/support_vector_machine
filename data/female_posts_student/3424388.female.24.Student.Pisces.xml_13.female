It's not that I'm popular by any stretch of the imagination, according to google's all-knowing algorithm, but I do it more to check the pulse of the internet.   And I'm frequently surprised.  I've not scientifically looked at this, mind you, but when I google myself every month or so, I find that the number of pages related to my name have multiplied exponentially - and the sites have nothing to do with me.  Usually, I explain away the jump using my last name, which resides in the gray area of commonality -- common enough that those put-your-family-name-on-a-satchel catalogs periodically show up in my mother's mailbox and uncommon enough to still be mangled by the increasingly rare telemarketer.
