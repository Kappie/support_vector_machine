It was something that everyone on the theatre board was doing, some kind of cameo thing for the members, I don't know but the manager of the theatre loves me and asked me to do it and my dad was doing it too so he made me. I really didn't want to, it was just a stupid little part and I didn't feel up to it, but my dad really wanted me to and it's "Father's Day" so I did it with him...and it actually turned out fun. I need to start being more open to the oppurtunities thrown at me. I mean, I got to dress up like a convict and wear handcuffs, (that I got out of) how awesome is that! -and no that was not sarcasm. Fun fun great fun. One thing I realized is that I really love being on the stage. It's such a thrill. I'm hoping this production class next year will be cool because I am definitely looking forward to it.   And then we went to I Love NY Pizza. That was cool too.   And did anyone else realize how much good stuff was on TV today? I think the Sci-Fi channel is once again rising up on my list of favorites. I watched Village of the Damned, Jeepers Creepers (not a good movie I know, but still entertaining), AND Urban Legend. Final Destination was on too but I missed it.   And I finally got my camera developed with all my prom pictures on it. Too bad it was like a 34 picture camera and only about 12 pictures came out, and only about 5 from prom. Oh well. There's always next year. And there were a couple good ones.    And I think my dog as ADD. But I love her for it.   I like how random my thoughts are...no connection whatsoever.    (Most of that stuff was boring I know....sorry, I just typed and that's what came out)
