Julie's such a fuckin brat. A bigger brat than even me. Grandpa's talking to her, telling her to give him the bowl so he can wash it but she's ignoring him even though she heard him say it. She just continued talking on the fuckin phone. What a bitch... If that kid wasn't my sister, I'd have fuckin beat her up already.   Trying to call Nima at his cell. Oh well. Dunno if it works... *sighzZ* I wanna talk to him before I go out. Moca just got outta the shower so yeah. Gotta wait for her. Nobody answering... I'll just hang up. Oooh he picked up... haha. Oh well... he said he'd call back after a while. Blah... oh well. I should go now... bye bye. Blog laters.
