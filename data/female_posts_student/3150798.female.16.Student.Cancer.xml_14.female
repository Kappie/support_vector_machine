I gt my first piercings this January, and though I expected it to be awful, it didn't hurt at all. I have always considered my self to have a low tolerance for pain. I've been known to be violent when the doctor said I needed a shot. It took me years just to get the nerve to get my ears done. But that first small piercing is behind me, and this is something I really want.  I've been researching nose piercings. Most people say the pain is quick and not too bad at all, but I'm not entirely sure. I think it may be worth it, though, because I think nose piercings are adorable. And it's not a rebellion or anything. my parents have okayed it, my mom will take me, and sign the form. She wants me to look into it more, and think about it more, which I am doing.  So, it is quite likely to happen. I don't want anything big, just a small stud. Maybe I'll buy some different coloured gems, but I'll probably mostly stick to a clear crystal. And I know some people will be so envious- most parents won't even consider it. So my parents may be sticks-in-the-mud about  dating  and boys(which they have actually loosened up a great deal on, since they know they can trust me in that area). But they will let me get my nose pierced, so they are actually pretty cool. Belly buttons and eyebrows are out of the question, as well as anything in or around the mouth, but that's okay. My nose is what I really want done.  So, it may shock the grandparents, but I'm sure they will love me anyway. If I actually get the nerve, this will be so much fun!
