This is a video I would expect from some watered-down industrial group, like Crappity Kills.  Still digging TGWOTR.  My favorite Skinny Puppy album to date.  Although it's no Rabies or VIVISECT IV, I like the direction they are taking.  Forward-thinking industrial-it's about fucking time!  After listening to all the "new" industrial releases of note, this was a breath of fresh air.  I had almost written "industrial" (if you can even still call it that anymore-dead genre) off entirely.  Groups like Zeromancer and all the Cleopatra/Metropolis shit had put me off of even listening to industrial anymore.  Thank Jeebus for the Pup.  All praise the Kevs!
