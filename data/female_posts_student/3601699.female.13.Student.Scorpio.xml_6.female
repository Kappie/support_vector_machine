Well, except for the project due on Thursday...and getting our yearbooks on Friday...and our homeroom the following Monday BUT OTHER THAN THAT, there's nothing.  No more grade 8 classes for the rest of my life. Ta-da!  To celebrate, I got pizza and watched Scary Movie 3.  Not too festive, but damn, that movie's funny!  As a final little note, I was very proud of the cast of Kill Bill in the MTV Movie Awards last night.  Uma, Chiaki and Lucy certainly deserved those awards, and I must say, Lucy Liu's evil laugh was a wonderful touch. Go Kill Bill!
