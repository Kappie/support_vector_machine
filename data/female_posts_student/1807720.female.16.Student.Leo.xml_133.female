I feel like whatever was missing before has now just arrived right infront of my face.  Even I am not sure what this means, I just know I feel good.  I got my brows waxed today and went shopping again and bought myself - YES I TREATED MYSELF - anyways a pink spring jacket.  I LOVE it. , and I can't wait to show chels.  I think that her and I and some of the uiversity/college guys are going to Edi's house to play some pool and stuff.  And well yeah I guess that jacket was a reward to myself for all my hard work for making honors and I used part of my grandma's $40 that she gave to put towards the total value.  My mom also bought me a roxy shirt which I love.  And well I got my eyes checked today too, and my vision is still the same.  Did I mention that I also ruined a pair of my new underwear that had little glimmery jewels on em.  It wasn't suppose to be my T.O.M. til like next Saturday but you know how it is.  The monthly visit always comes when your least expecting it, lol - that sounds so bad!  Anways year grr. that was like my favourite pair, but well it could have been worse.  In fact, I have had and been though worse things than that.
