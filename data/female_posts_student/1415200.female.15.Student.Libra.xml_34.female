I guess that comes from thinking too much.  Loneliness is a state of mind, not a state of being. :: jaTR 3:07  ::   Wow. Isnt that a true mission statement of life.  I think later, like around noon, im going to place a call to the guys and see if they want to do anything. Im thinking sno-boarding. but its fucking-cold-ass outside and I dont know if I want to brave the weather.  Yeah, im still sick. But i dont think they know whats wrong with me. Sometimes when I eat, well after I eat, I get really cold, and really sick to my stomach all at the same time. Then I get really dizzy, almost blacked out. I dont think thats good. but thats between me and you. Im almost done reading the first vol. of  Ceres  it's pretty good. then again I like alot of Yu Watatse's works. So there you go. I know this is short, but I gotta go. Im getting really sick again, because I ate a pop-tart. I'll blog later. Maybe when the guys are here.
