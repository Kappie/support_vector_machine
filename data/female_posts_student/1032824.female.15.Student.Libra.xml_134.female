It reminds me of how Ms Low brainwashes our class with her anti-malaysian statements. No insults, but I used to execrate the malaysian government when they were under Mahathir.  I don't know what am I laughing at, I just find that piece of article  really  entertaining! Politics! Wooyeah! :o)  I think most of our teachers are on the verge of exploding. We're sucha noisy and mischevious bunch of kids.   "Quiet children!" -- Fengrui, on asking the class to keep their mouths sealed.
