Not only did I tidy, but I vacuumed and dusted, making me feel much better about myself. I've decided that there is no point to living in a messy house: it's harder to find things, I get panicky if people come over, and I don't get to enjoy my lovely decorations and knick-knacks. So I am attempting to be tidy. It's somewhat more difficult over at Jerm's, because we tend to be messy together, and I hate cleaning up after other people (something that I  will  get over when I have kids). When I finish with my room, I'm going to get over my weird issues over dealing with strange people and go to the grocery store and the water store. And I'll spend this evening reading, with a break for either the OC or the Bachelorette... I'm not sure which right now. Damn the TV programmers!
