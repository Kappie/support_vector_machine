My eyes are so tired of crying and wish to close for all eternity.  Soon I shall become but a walking shell of Nicole who has eyes but cannot see, lips but cannot speak, ears but cannot hear and a heart but cannot love.  Is this to be life when one has lost love?  The sole purpose to live?  One day, when i have finally conquered Life and Love, I will look back and laugh.
