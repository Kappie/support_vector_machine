Then when I put my contact in it hurt SOOO bad but I couldn't take it out because I didn't have anytime. Then, I don't think I told any of you this but I have been having a lot of hearing problems recently, I don't know why...but I couldn't hear at all in one ear.  So I was blind and deaf :)  Then when I got to school I realized that I left all my books on the dining room table with all my homework in it.  Sad times.  Then, I was in a rush to get to tennis and I went to go get my bag out of the bathroom and it was GONE. Someone stole it...I had 150+ dollars worth of wonderful stuff in that bag. Including my favorite shoes. waaa   So at tennis I had to use my horrible shoes that don't have any grip so I slipped and slidded all around the gym. It was kinda funny...in a really not funny at all sort of way.   Uh oh.   My play starts soon so I got to go.  I will recount my horrible day maybe..tomorrow...
