I stayed up til 5.00am to listen to sub-standard audio and sit helplessly as my team forfeits the opportunity to steal top spot on the ladder and instead slip to 4th. Fuckity fuck fuck.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with this new blog *pats* I'm unsure how different it will be from my melo and all the rest of it. I'm thinking the melo might be for sculpted entries ilke those from the good ol' days whereas this blog will be an effective dumping ground for my useless ramblings.  I'm done now. You can go play some  urlLink games .
