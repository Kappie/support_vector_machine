I am not sure i could take being away from him for much longer. I miss him so much. But last night was a lil rough. After i wrote my entry last night i read Kristelles blog and found out some things I didn't know. And in wone part she claimed that " ...so even when he was going out with Kari he liked me..."! So of course I was all upset and crying and all upset. I called Andrew and i started to think that maybe i did like him becuz Jessie told me that the guy who is really ment for me might be right under my nose and i just never relized it. Well i don't think that is true cuz i miss Jake way to much. So I gotta go take care of him and tell him that when i said that I like him that I was just a lil confused. I still have to break up with Brenden but I don't think that it will be to hard.  Ok I am so cold. Yesterday was so warm. Today it is SOOOOOO cool. I just wish there was sumone here to warm me up. (hint hint JACOB) LOL well that wasn't obvious. O well. Just thought i would throw that in there. Cuz I love my Jacob. Ok well I am out  Peace out,
