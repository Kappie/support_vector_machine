I have been trying to study for classes but life just keeps me away from the things that I need to get done. I am trying to stay focused but it just seems to be too hard. I am on the verge of just giving up completely. Anyway enought bitching today. Let's just pray that I don't go crazy in the next couple of days. If I can just make it till friday everything will be okay.
