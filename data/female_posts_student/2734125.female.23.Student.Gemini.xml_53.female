I found that I have themes: reality, dreams (at times blending), and flowers.  There are things that will come up over and over, forming some sense of a linear narrative, and others that only are said once.  I have an audience.  My roommate was talking about blogs, and journals, while we stood in the snow.  She said that blogging is a way to gain intimacy without risk, a way to ask for immortality, a way to romanticise someone listening to you.  I have done this, I have written about it.  I have wondered in a morbid way what this typing has meant, if anything, to anyone.    I am writing a paper on this strange thing called blog.  I would request (in the name of research) that if you read this blog, leave me a comment.  I don't need to know who you are, or any of that.  Just tell me how often you have read it, if you've kept up, and a general sense of what you may have gleaned or not from it.  Maybe why you read blogs.  If you don't want to... whatever.    I cant believe its snowing out.    In fact, don't tell me who you are, because she (my roommate) may be correct.  I don't really need to know who you are, may not want to.  I have a sense of some of the readers, people who have mentioned it or who have posted in the past... but to a certain extent, I want to write as if you are listening and you is someone who I know and don't know.  You are someone who knows something about me, and I might talk to you, and smile at you, and you could be thinking, "I know a few of your passions.  I know some of what is in you."  Because, honestly, despite the knowledge that I have an audience, I have been honest with what I have given.  You do know parts of me, and I don't always know those same parts of you.  It is an exposure, and sign of tense giving, revealing my neck in a head tilt.  I wonder if it gives you any power over me.  I wonder if I have power over those that I have read.  This blog thing is a question of performing, and it is a question of wanting, and is it a call for attention, a nod in the authors direction, some kind of narcissism that we allow our selves, thinking we have something to say.  We are in a culture where no one really listens that often.  No one really asks how we are and means it.  No one is really wanting to listen to me talk about reality, about how frightening it is, or how exciting.  There is not so much intimacy daily- there is a thin sheet of plastic between ourselves and everyone else.  I am afraid to expose everything to everyone.  there is rejection, and a small self that is really not all that sure, and there is the ego behind it that would never really fail me, but I don't want to put to the test.  So maybe this is an attempt.  I wrote the other day that this was a confessional, and I think that it is, but in a different way.  this is a confessional not for the sake of getting rid of sin- no, sin is just an excuse to have the moments of safely whispering to another person.  It is a moment of openness that is secure as well.    It is a pale replacement though, to real exposure, to real trust.  It is a sad fill in for the moments of real connection.  I like writing here, I do, but can you hear it ring a little hallow?  Even from your side?  When you read here, are you looking for something?  Are you finding it?  Is there something that you want to ask?  Something that you want to know, but cant say, so you read this, avoiding the exposure?    My story, my narrative, is larger than this.  It is in the middle, and it is wide and deep, and it is not contained here.  This narrative is back and forth, I jump in time and twist from thought to thought.  You can tell time is passing, there are the flowers that I mention in bud, then bloom, then death, and there are the dates, but I couldn't tell you if it is real time.    In my mind I am begging to be held, and am not finding comfort, and am not finding connection to others.  I have been gifted with some connection to the things around me, the moments that step out of the normal flow, but there is a strange lack tonight.  I will sleep off my uncomfortable gap, and in the morning have an outlook less shadowed by the sound of rain.
