I'm also looking at shifting my main site over here, possibly along with selected items from my other  urlLink D-land  site which I shut down because... well, as a  urlLink friend of mine  put it, because my husband and my diary didn't get along. :) Honestly, I started writing at that site a very long time ago and we (my now-husband and I) had some really serious issues to work out. I needed, at the time, a place to vent and say the awful, hurtful things that I would never want to actually say   to   him. If that makes any sense. But, if I may say so myself, I did some beautiful writing there. So I'll probably pull in the ones that I'm most pleased about from there. So it's going to look like I did an insane amount of posting all at once. Really, though, these are all old posts... Well, you know, except for this one, obviously... :)
