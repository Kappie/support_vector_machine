     
      My grandfather died on Friday morning (March 12, 2004).  Daniel P. Dodd.  It's been an odd couple of days and I don't really wish to comment on my emotions because in too many ways I haven't even begun to grieve and I am feeling everything from anger to immense sadness.  Unfortunately much of the anger is manifesting itself through selfish comments but I'm getting through it...  The funeral is Tuesday.
