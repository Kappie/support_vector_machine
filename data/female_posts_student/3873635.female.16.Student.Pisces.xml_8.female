I usually watch tv, but I spent 2 hours watching pure Jessica Simpson last night, and though at the time it was fun, I really regret it now. I just am not the type of person that deals with being bored easily. I guess I could do the SAT and ACT books my parents bought me... actually, no, I don't want to. I could also read, but that doesn't seem like doing anything to me! And I can't go to the pool becuase of this gay weather! >:(
