The morning was pretty routine, and in the afternoon we won the squad competition, so we got to perform our little show during the demonstration tonight that all the parents and such attended. That was fun. In preparation for this, we covered Mr. Heath's, Mr. Lesniak's, and Mr. Buckley's cars in streamers and car paint. That was fun. And on the backs of our shirts we wrote messages informing them to check their cars. More fun :). We had a lot of fun with the squad competition, and I guess the show went pretty well, too. Band camp is over! Hooray! Except for the fact that now there are about two weeks until school starts up again :(.      Last song I listened to:   Tuesday's Gone  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Last album I listened to:   Prounounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd .   Last meal I ate:  Chicken sandwich and jalape√±o flavored chips.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  We won squad comps! Yea!   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.   Favorite song today:   Happy Jack  by The Who.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  We won squad comps! Yea!   Funniest thing that happened today:  Lots of stuff. Primarily decorating the band directors' cars ;). And making shirts for the squad competion.
