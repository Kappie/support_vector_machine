She described him saying he is not to tall, fat, bald, with glasses driving a car with a sunroof (couldn't remember what colour)... This is likely my ex... he and his family have been harassing me but now its turned into stalking... And last Friday my place was broken into I think it was him or his crazy fat sister or his insane girlfriend who looks like a little boy... I have had to change my phone number because of these freaks, add extra locks on my door because of these losers and now he sits in his car all day while i am at work occasionally leaving it to look in my windows... I am really creeped out.
