And it's definately better than the lives of some people I no... Ai ya, I can hear my parents sing... *shivers Life's not fair... I ramble a lot don't I? I've said so much yet I've said nothing at all. Let's start over.  I'm a 15-year-old Chinese Canadian with longish hair. Longish as in longer than any normal guy is ever supposed to have but shorter than that of the guys in Media Garden. I suk at pretty much everything. In fact, I'm failing Gym class... And I'm still in a state of shame after losing at air hockey to a girl... It's one of the delimmas in my life. I'm not good enough at anything to be clearly defined as anything.  I do, however, have a passion for writing. It's sad cause nothing I write ever gets published. Except what I just wrote, and that, and that, and that... Right, so maybe my stuff do get published. Some of my poems got published at Poetry.com and then they started scamming me for money... Nevertheless, Criff is the main character of my current major project. Well, my first major project anyway. I've got about 5k words into the story so far. Basically, it's this fantasy story involving magic and stuff. I'm really too lazy to give a basic description... But if u want one or want to c what I got so far, don't be afraid to ask me through e-mail. Sigh, I'm so bored that I've resorted to this... I still can't belive it.  Well, I supposed I need some love right now. But I doubt I can get any without giving first. So here it is, I LOVE YOU! Now love me back or I'll hunt u down and make u give my love back. That's it for now. Cya.
