But he cant do anything and he cant come hang out with me cause "Im not worthwhile" or something. what the fuck? somebody needs to get stabbed. Or maybe someone is blowing this out of proportion? In any case, its pissing me off and making me horrendously sad. Fuck those fucking fuckers who fuck everything up in this stupid  fucking place.   ::stab::   ~abby
