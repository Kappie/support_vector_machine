       
      Leave it to me to have a mini-breakdown and semi-sleepless night the eve of an easy school day, promising a solid 2 hours of sleep-in time.  Nothing really new to report.  The same, obligatory overwhelming wave of realization about just what I've gotten myself into, resisting the duty to act accordingly and all the while having a sneaking suspicion I'm not doing enough.  What in the goddamn hell am I going to do with myself?  Signing up for diversity certification training in April helped a bit.  And writing the motion to suppress tangible evidence this weekend will help substantially.  Productivity is our friend.  Just trying to figure out what this bout of doubt/vulnerability is trying to teach me.  Typing notes from class is helping, too.  Can't seem to escape the fear/worry that I'm wasting time, opportunities, not applying myself fully, etc.  But at the same time, I realize that anything I'm supposed to do/find will never let me pass it by, no matter how much I may try to ignore it.  Sigh.  This seems to be my favorite struggle.
