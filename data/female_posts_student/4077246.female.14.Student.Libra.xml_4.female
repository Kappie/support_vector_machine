But yesterday while we were at Arby's(we includes Ryan Wildes, his mom, my mom, my sis, and me) this bush outside the restraunt caught on fire. We were thinking ok someone must have thrown a lit cigarette in it. The manager walked out with the fire extinguisher thingy and put it out. When she walked back behind the counter,I heard one of the employees ask her if the cigarette theory was right. The manager answered, "No it was the same bush that caught on fire the last few times." Needless to say I don't want to go there again.                                                                                I'm outtie! buh bye
