She has really good advice sometimes, and one of those times is now. I hate those times when someone just changes and you dont know why or if it had anything to do with you, and if it did, what you did wrong. Oh well, I just feel really overwhelmed right now. I think I need to just take a break for a little while and hang out by myself and not plan to do so much. Well, I am being forced off the computer. I have a lot to say, but I guess it'll have to wait until later.
