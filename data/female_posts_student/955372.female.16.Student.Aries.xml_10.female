I'm like ok whatever it'll only take like a minute, i'll just put my away message up. Then my sister goes "Yeah I need to check my mail too" So i'm like fine alright whatever it's not like i was doing something online or anything, OH WAIT A SEC! yeah so before the comp was stolen from me (ps it took a total of like ten minutes or more) i was just about to say something really important to somebody (don't worry if u think it's you, cuz it wasn't trust me) so then by the time i get back on, the person signs off. HISSS. And then i'm like yeah "thanks guys" and my mom says "stop being so sarcastic" god! somebody give my a friggin gun. grrrr.
