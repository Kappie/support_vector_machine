AP bio students chime in plz, i hope i can write this simply enough so other ppl aren't reading greek  So certain bacteria infections develop immunities to antibiotics (tuberculosis is one of those infections that has developed near immunity to antibiotics, in Russian prisons at least).  That developed immunity is in the DNA of the bacteria.  So, theoretically, one could isolate the immunity DNA sequence and create a second specialized sequence of DNA that would disrupt its function.  This disruption DNA could be sent into the immune bacteria via a plasmid and obliterate the bacteria's immunity, allowing cheap antibiotics to function once again.  Similar results could come from some mechanism of methylating (disabling) the immunity DNA of the bacteria.  Make sense? Plausible?  Done before?  Jason?  Carlie?  Maggie?  Looking at some abstracts of research, and it seems like methylation is being tried now.
