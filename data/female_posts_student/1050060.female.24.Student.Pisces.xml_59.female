I felt so good when I was not smoking. I didn't have that taste in my mouth. It was nice when I would brush my teeth and they would stay clean. Anyways we are have one heck of a snow storm. I am happy I don't have school tomorrow. One of my uncle's friend died so we are going to Edmundston maybe tomorrow for the day. Anyways I have a lot more to say but I will keep it for Wednesday or Friday. Have a good day!
