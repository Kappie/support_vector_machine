Along with the fact that he probably hasn't yet finished high school and has a child, his grammar is a total turn off:   "i'm vary outgoing. looking for long lasting ralationship. who injoys the same intersit i do. no short ralitionship.im vary funney. my deam date wold be at the water front with wine waching the sun set and talking for hours. so try me and you wont be dispointment"  Um...okay.
