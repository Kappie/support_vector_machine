Well on the way to the mall I decided to show Amanda and Alex where I used to live in Lake Oswego. I showed them my house, and then I decided to see if my old friend Mika was home (we used to be neighbors). She was, so I got to see her for a bit. It was nice because I haven't seen her in quite awhile. I think it has been a little more than a year. We are going to try to do something on Wednesday. So anyway....we go to the mall. Well along the line somewhere, Amanda's plan of finding a bed frame got lost. So me and Alex just follow her around while she looks for bathing suits. It was fun. We did some weird things, and took some weird pictures, but it was all really fun. Even Amanda said she had a good time, and needs to take the both of us again. After that, I decided to go get some black licorice ice cream with Alex. That was fun too. After the ice cream we were walking home, and we decide that we want to watch a movie. We want to watch one that Amanda owns, so we call her, and Amanda says she'll come pick us up. Me and Alex, being the bright ones, decide that it would be funny if we just sat down on the sidewalk and waited. Of course we embarassed ourselves, but it was all in the name of fun. So we go to Alex's house, and watch the movie. Then after the movie, we decide to go through the field and take the sign that says "Be prepared to stop", which we've had our eyes on for awhile. It was dark, so it was the perfect time to take it. On our way there, we heard something in the grass, and it scared me, and I jumped behind Alex and grabbed onto her. It was so funny. Well, after we got the sign and were out of visibility we just kept laughing and Alex fell. It was so freakin funny! We decided to put the sign in the fort, and going in there when it was dark was way scary. It was really fun tho. Then after that, I went back to Alex's house for about 20 min, and then went home. Today was a really fun day!
