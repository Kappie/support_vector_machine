John's not commin though cause he don't like Stasi lol. So.. oh yea.. I just had like a 30 minute converstaion with a telemarketer. It was kinda funny actaully. He said he wanted to talk to me about switching Verison for long distance phone calls and I said "I'm not the bill payer of the house." and he goes "Oh, are you the daughter?" and I said "That would be me." and he said "Oh, how old are you?" and I said "16." and then hes like "Oh, well I'm 18 so don't think your talking to an old man." I'm like "Okay." so then he asked me if I had a boyfriend I could call long distance to and I'm like nah. And we started to talk about who casues more trouble: boys or girls. Then he asked me my nationality and asked how Staten Island was (I guess next to my number it says that or something) and I'm like "Cold. It's really cold outside." and hes like "Oh really? Im in Alberquirkie (sp?), New Mexico." and so I asked "Hows the weather there?" and hes like "It's nice, it rained this morning though." and I'm like "Well as long as it's sunny now!" and then he told me that hes from Long Island origonally. And then I don't know he asked me if I had an e-mial address and I said yes, but he didn't ask for it. And then he said "Okay, I'm sure you dont want to say on the phone with me." and I go, "Nah, I don't have anything else to do" so we talked for a little while longer and then that was it and he said he would call back later and the phone just rang five minutes ago but I didn't get to it in time. Oh well lol... okay, I'll post when I get back from Vins! Peace x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x
