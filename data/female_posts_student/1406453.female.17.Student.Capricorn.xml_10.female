The 20's was an era of party, freedom, and ecstasy... but little enlightement. We all forget that in that time of "flapper" freedom, women barely had the right to vote, blacks in the south might as well have remained slaves, and homosexuality was often, while understatedly, considered a disease. Cole Porter wrote some of the most brilliant musical literature of the modern era, as directly recognized by such other shining stars as Irving Berlin and the Gershwin Brothers, some of my personal favorites. His personal life was beautifully intertwined with his witty and clever lyrics. The movie "De-Lovely" completely embodied the delightful and deep spirit of Porter, with outstanding and true-to-character performances by both Kline and Judd. The intensity of the cinematography and editing underscored the terrific direction and cohesiveness of the cast. Truly a movie for the oldest of this generation and the youngest of the past century. A fantastic whirlwind!  Cliche, eh?  I went for my physical today, just to see if my body is held together by scotch tape or wood glue before I head off to D.C. My favorite moment of the day: Nurse: "Do you take birth control?" Me: "No." Nurse: "Are you sexually active?" Me: "Uh, no. I thought the whole no-birth control thing kind of explained that." Nurse: "Oh, well then, one last question: is there any chance you might be pregnant?" Okay, now my two favorite jobs in the world: #1- Naming new Ice-Cream flavors for Baskin Robbins, #2 Writing questions for medical examination forms  Also, I got two shots: Menangitis in the Rt. arm, Tetanus in the Left; don't ask me how I'm even typing. I think I'll just keep going until I can lift my arms again.  Doing lots of laundry as I leave for Yosemite in 2 days. Gone until 7/25, folks. Let me know if you want a postcard or a picture of me completely sunburned.P.S. --> COMMENTS
