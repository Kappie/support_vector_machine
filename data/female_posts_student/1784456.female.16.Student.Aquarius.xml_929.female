Hehe... think I scared him away. It's always the little green men that muck up my web page! *sigh* Any way, know that I can actually blog and not just be met with a pink screen I better blog! I didn't go to Emma's party yesterday, I was waaay too sick and tired. I'ld probably turn up and go straight to sleep! But I'm meeting every one at the park... err... which park? Ahh well, I'll just go to any one! Whoopsie! Some one commented on this but seeing as we're all wearing blinkers no one noticed! Hmm... saneasakitten takes ages to load! And apparantly it's got an error on it... any one wanna help me iron? Ohhh sorry pete person who commented *go annoy him here:  urlLink http://www.petejakehall.com/  Wait a sec... lemme hold on to this feeling... wow... some one commented... ahhhh. Ok, so any way about the Lifehouse lyrics. What is real is just a dream. I think those lyrics are good! They actually make people think. Like a John Mayor song saying erm... wait a sec lemme go validate... hmm can't find the lyrics in my head or the song! Damn! Ahh well... I'll just listen to John Mayor then... ahhh....
