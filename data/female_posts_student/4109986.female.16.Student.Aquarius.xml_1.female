First-off my tahoe wasn't running right and that really sucked. But then we kinda got it fixed. Secondley we ended up borowing my grandparents vehical. That was cool. Then we were off to the Clack Co. Fair for some Freestyle Motocross some Quad War's  some Mini War's it was awesome. I wasn't really into the Mini War's but the Quad War's and the Freestlye WAS AWESOME!!! Clark Co. got there first backflip and tons of amazing tricks. And I got to get it all on camera. I have got some of the most awesomest pictures that I never would have imagined capturing of my digital. And I had a really great time!! The Quad war's were awesome too there was the Washington team .VS. the L.A. team and of course for the third or fourth year in a row WASHINGTON KICKED ASS!! It was awsome! well anyways off for now. I'm going to go get into a little bit of trouble today! Tata for now!
