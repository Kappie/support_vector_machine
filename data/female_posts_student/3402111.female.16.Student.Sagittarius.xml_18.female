It is an excellent movie and has really good views in it.  The quote above is from the main character's (Russel Crowe) "roomate."  Who does not truly exist, but he is a good guy.  He is played by the actor who acted as Chaucer in  A Knight's Tale . And I, bringing out the analytical part of me, remembered this quote.    For the most part I agree with it.  A majority of the components in life are arbitrary.  Nothing is set in stone.  All you have in life can be taken away.  And everything wrong in life can take a change for the better.  And no matter how many times you promise you will always be there for someone, or that you will always love someone, it always has the chance of changing or something or someone else can come along (as horrible as it sounds, it happens).     However, it seems kinda pessimistic at times.  For instance, my life is at, possibly, the highest point is has ever been.  But then, it isn't sure.  It can always change and become worse.  My best friend's situation proves that.  All of a sudden things were fine, and now they're not.     I prefer the optomistic view.  That even though things seem perfect, they can improve even more, beecome a degree of greatness that I can't even imagine.  I like thinking at all is well and will always be.  It may not be entirely healthy.  I mean I acknowledge the bad things in life and face them with the best of my ability.... it just helps at times to wish they weren't there.  And it seems kind of sad to me when I think that things can change.  Because I have so much that I couldn't bare to lose.  I have all that I need and more, and I know that I don't deserve them.  They are too good for me....
