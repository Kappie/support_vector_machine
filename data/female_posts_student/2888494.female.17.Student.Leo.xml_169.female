When disappointment and discouragement strike- and the will—you remember and never forget that if our eyes could be opened we would see horses and chariots of fire as far as the eye can see riding at reckless speed to come to our protection. (see 2 Kgs. 6:16-17) They will always be there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham’s seed”  							-Jeffrey R. Holland,                                             “For Times of Trouble,” New Era, Oct.1980, 15
