We were all commenting on how neat it was and how we'd all like one, and of course ADYP had to bring up the buring question: "What if you jizzed into one?  Could you create a new master race of seamonkeys?"  Alas, I come into work this morning and there is a Litre of  urlLink Poland Spring  on my desk which has been there festering under the light for about 3 weeks to a month.  I'd only drank about a quarter of it before I forgot about it all together.  I notice there is some green algae starting to grow in the bottom of it.  Now, for the sake of science I will leave this bottle here and see if I have created life through a little saliva and a lot of forgotten, overpriced bottled water.  Perhaps I will create a race of small people who will in turn capture me, shrink me and make me their Goddess, like they did to little Lisa Simpson.  That could be neat.  I bet being a diety pays well.  So here it is, officially,  Day 1 of the Great Ecosphere Experiment  has gotten underway.  All I have to report is a thin layer of green algae.  I'll keep you posted with developments.
