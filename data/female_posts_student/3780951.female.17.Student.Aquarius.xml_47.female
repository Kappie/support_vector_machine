WOW, so much dust. By time we got done we were sneezing like a crazy mad man! I found GoodWill is gonna have some nice AE clothes. And Cara got a lot too. I'm telling you in about 5 months come to my closet, you might just get yourself a new wardrobe! We finally got done 2 and a 1/2 hours later! I forgot to tell you what happen during the first part of the evening! The coolest rain storm came. A huge 50 year old oak tree fell down in caras drive way. Its a long gravel drive way but none the less this was a huge tree!! It was crazy, we were stuck out there for 2 hours. So much rain caused the grass to by slick and muddy since they live on a hill. But it was fun being entertained by Tanner, Cara's brother!! Well i'm done. I'll talk to yall tomorrow. :-D :-) Arent smilies great, Adam! Yea, they are!!  Peace and Chicken!
