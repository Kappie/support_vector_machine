I had a hard time finding him, but thank god for cell phones.  So we say the usual hellos and go buy our tickets.  More good conversation and the movie, well, the movie just made me scared for the future of America.  Not just because Michael Moore portrayed Bush as a dumbass, but I don't think any person can handle that much power of running a country.  Big heads start to show and the hunger for money builds up.  I won't give too much detail, everyone should see this flick before November-for whatever reason.  My dad doesn't want to see it, I told him he has to.  He thinks Kerry will raise our taxes.  "But Dad", I said,"Just go see the movie."  'I don't like the guy' he tells me.(meaning Michael Moore)"  Because of  Bowling for Columbine .  My dad, oy.  I cant disclose that kind of information, but don't ever try and take his right away to bear arms.     urlLink Article [IV.]   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   don't come messing with his daughter either!  =)  After the movie was over, we had more discussions over some good ole' BK and I had to get home.  I think we might go to the baseball game tonight and see some fireworks, that or I'll be making cupcakes till  6 in tha mornin'.  Might be doing that anyway.  More exciting news, I WON the CONTEST!  You can check it out  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . Please visit both, a whole lotta fun.  I guess I have to decide what I want as my 'prize'.  Sod says a gift card for $2,000 to  urlLink amazon.com .  Doubt that will happen.  Now for the fun stuff!!
