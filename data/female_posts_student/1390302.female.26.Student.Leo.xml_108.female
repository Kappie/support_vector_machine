It never gets back out again." ~Bill Austin    Well, It looks like Matt and I will be moving to Stephenville on the weekend of July 9th-11th.  We got a mobile home, not a used one, a new one.  We’re going to go back this Friday and pay for it, then, we’re going to have it moved and set up in the park on the week of July 5th and move in that weekend.  Out move was originally planned for the end of August, then it was planned for the end of July, not it’s been moved up.    To all who know me, I’ll send y’all my new address, and my new phone number (as soon as I know my new phone #).  This takes a HUGE weight off my shoulders.  I have been stressing out big time, now I can relax, pack, and prepare for my move.  Hopefully, unlike every move we’ve made since I’ve lived here, this move will go smoothly.  Matt and I are paying a company here in central Texas to move our belongings for us.  It’s surprisingly inexpensive when you break down the cost.  The last time we moved it cost us upwards of $400, having someone do it for us is only going to cost $500 or so and they’re insured.  Meaning if they break anything, or everything for that matter, they pay to have it replaced.  It’s a really nice thing!  Not to mention the fact that it’s the middle of the summer in Texas!  Texas has to be the hottest place on the face of the earth –except maybe Ecuador.  Moving our own things in this heat will kill us.  When I was young I had severe heat exhaustion and ever since I’ve had trouble with the sun and heat.  The heat and sun have a really bad effect of Matt as well, but I won’t get into that.  So now, the only thing I am stressed about is getting everything in order in the next three weeks.  I have been thinking about it and I am not sure that the place has phone jacks, so we may have to have them installed, which is pretty expensive.  Hopefully C.L. will help us out with that if it needs to be done.  I suppose we’ll see on Friday.    Yep, this Friday, for the 4th Friday in a row, Matt and I are making the trip to Stephenville.  Then, we’ll have one or two Fridays to relax before our move.  Life is just flying by right now.  We are also both still in school until the first week of July so that is a really stressful thing as well.    All in all, life is coming together pretty nicely.  We are getting things done and soon we’ll be residents of Stephenville, TX.    Oh and did I mention that we’re probably going to get another cat?  We’re going to go look at Fuzzy Friends for another kitty today.  We want to get Chummer familiar with a little kitty before we change his environment.  That way he can adjust to one thing at a time.  So wish me luck in the next few weeks.    Regards, Kristyn
