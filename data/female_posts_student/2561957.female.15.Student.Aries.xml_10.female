Probably. Probably not. Oh, well. All we can really do is hope, right?      Hope, oh, that was something I used to always try and cram into his widdle mind... Crap. I'm missing him. I'm missing him way too much, and it's been about an hour. I can't stop being bitter... Whenever I'm depressed, I always go into different stages. Let's go through the stages?   Stages of Depression:   (1) Spite   (2) Sadness   (3) Verbal Brutality   It just kind of repeats until I get over it. Isn't that awful?      Anyways, I'm just going to go... I'll try and work on the blog thing later today. Maybe. Oh, I don't know...
