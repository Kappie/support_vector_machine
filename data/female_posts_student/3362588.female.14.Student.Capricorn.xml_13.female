Went to Better Design, and the hat I WANTED to get wasn't there anymore (it was just your ordinary flex fit with red embroidery on the holes and the bill).  So instead, I got a hat that looks exactly like that, but it's mesh stuff.  Like the mesh they use for sport jerseys.  It's lined though, so your hair doesn't show through.  I'm getting Jack embroidered on it in red in cursive.  For anyone who wants a custom hat, Better Design is the place to get it done.  Only $3 a word.    I ate a ton of watermelon for breakfast - like half - and felt bloated with water for the rest of the day.  That was really good watermelon though.  Really sweet and mmmmm.  heh.    Nothin' else has really happened today.  I was home alone all morning 'cause mom and dad were at work and Clarisa has been at Alisha's for the last two days.  *sigh* I swear she lives there.    Can't believe camp is Saturday!!!  Yeahhhhhh!!  Slug time... haha.  'Twill be fun.    Awwww Man.........  I have a test in Spanish....... Oh well.  I know all the stuff.  It'll be easy - I hope.    Signing off-  Yours Truely
