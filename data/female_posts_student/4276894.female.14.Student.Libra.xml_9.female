Like you could go on a date, or you could make up with a best mate, or you could throw a party! Either way, in your lowest, deepest, darkest moments, there'll always be those who'll stand up for you and keep you going.    You might not be best mates with them, you might not even like them... but it's those people who keep the world going. There are loads of people who have made my life at the moment the best it's ever been, but there's one person who I know I can always turn to, and who has always been there for me.    ----------
