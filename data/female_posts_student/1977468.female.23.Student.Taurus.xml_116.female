Ahhh, the good old days of college, when one finishes and starts each year separately, with the blissful 3-month period of refreshment, fun, and completely sedentary thought life. Forget high school summers. Who even misses that? Just as a warning to you all, if you ever meet a person who laments in a wistful manner, "Remember high school? The best years of my life!

Most likely Evie will be scratching away at her Californian hives, which appeared like a bandit in the still of the night and spread all over her person in blotchy swollen blooms. And when I say everywhere, I mean everywhere. While "Life is a Highway" blasts through my speakers and the wind from the sunroof ruffles our unkempt hair, Evie will be driving and rubbing her face on the steering wheel, and I'll be balancing my Addictions homework on one knee, a Narrative Therapy novel on the other and the road map out of this popsicle stand on the dash, held fast by my bare toes. Wish us luck. Here we come, Washington. ...
