But it was because Max called!!!:) and he talked to Britt and Mandy and then I talked to him and I kind of just kept talking... he had me believing that he was moving to Canada 4 days after he got back from Costa Rica... I feel so stupid for believing him... what a meanie?!?!?! oh well it made me laugh... he also said that he had $40,000 and that he was going to buy me a car for my birthday... hahaha... At least I didnt believe that one!!! haha... Well I am tired and We need to go to sleep I have to get scheduled for school tomorrow... eep... that means I have to get my picture taken... AHHH I have to actually fix my hair tomorrow... that sucks!!! oh well... It was nice to hear from Maxipants and it was nice to have Sumi meet all my friends... good times... well      nighty night     -gabby
