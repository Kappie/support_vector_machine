Man do I get crabby if I don't get at least 10 hours. Last night I think I got about 12 and I feel like a different person. I hope someday I will be more like other people who can sleep 8 and remain functional and happy. I would get so much more done. But I really would miss my many hours of dreams, which don't seem to happen when I cut the 12 hours short.   Raul also helped me through the stress of moving into an apartment that wasn't ready in a number of ways, most significant: the toilet won't flush and the carpet in the bedroom looks like 30 cats got trapped in there for 30 days without a litter box. I had talked to the landlord about ripping it out a long time ago and he agreed. So now all of my stuff is in the living room as I wait for this deal to happen. Raul reminded me that everything will be resolved and that some good will come out of it, as with any drama.
