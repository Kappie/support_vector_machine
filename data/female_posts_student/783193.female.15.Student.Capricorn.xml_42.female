We're also going to "celebrate Mother's Day as a family together once again", as my mom says. She's kind of weird. Also, we were supposed to play the School of the Deaf today, but apparently, the game was cancelled without our knowledge of it, and we all trooped there and stood in the wind like a little red-shirted group of lost sheep. My goodness, that sounded really weird. Anyway, I was dumping Milo's litter pan today, so it would be clean before we leave, and I looked around the corner when I was going down the stairs, and there's this huge mosquito hawk on the carpet! Those things are really freaky. They're those really creepy ten-times-bigger-than-regular-mosquitoes-which-are-already-kind-of-creepy mosquitoes. I didn't know what to do with it, and I wasn't sure whether it was alive or not, so I blew it a couple of times, but really gently because I didn't want it to fly up and around. That would be scary. Speaking of gentle, Kristyn says that I should stop being so gentle. Yuck, I just used that word twice in the same sentence. I don't know how to write it otherwise. there'll just be a lot of weird grammatical errors in the entry. Oh, and speaking of Kristyn, me, Jodi, Hannah, Kristyn, and Caroline were in Caroline's car, but it's not a van, so four of us were squishing in the back, and then on the way back, there was a cop right behind us, so Caroline was trying to pretend there were only three people in the back, so she leaned over , and her head didn't fit anywhere, so she stuck them between my legs. It was really uncomfortable, so I told her to put her head back up when we passed the police, so then she did, but she was being all sleepy and was like, face-down on Kristyn and my thighs, and so Kristyn was doing her I-love-to-mess-people's-hair-up rubbing thing, and so Caroline put her head back between my legs for the rest of the trip. And she was tickling my knees the whole time, so I was like jerking around and trying not to laugh, so I let out these little explosions of air once in a while. Yeesh. Anyway, I have to continue packing...
