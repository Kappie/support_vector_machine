It was great to talk to her again, I really miss her. We decided to meet sometime next week. That's going to be great! Then I remembered that it's my friend  Yorda's birthday today . So I called her, and she found that very  sweet ! :D  Tomorrow I'm taking her out for birthday lunch. I really miss her too. But not the same way. Cause she'll be in my class this fall. So I know that I'll see her a lot anyhow. But I still miss her.  After I talked to them I went to the tiny amusement park with my mother and the kids at the Kindergarden where she works. I helped out, cause I love kids. And I saw a  gorgeous  guy that works there. His name is  Olle  and he's one year older than me. He's so hot! :D  I smile just thinking about him...    After that we went to get ice cream! Let me tell yu, kids are not good at eating ice cream! By the time we were done, they had ice cream all over themselves. It's unbelievable.  *sighs*  Now I'm home relaxing. Waiting for tomorrow to come.    I love my friends! :)
