After im finished getting ready go to the mall to get some clothes because i only have 2 pairs of jeans and jeans are pretty much what i wear. Also to get a shirt or two and maybe a purse. Also show my mom the winter jacket I want and the shoes i want. I mean come on i have to get on the ball my birthday is in 10 days and plus i didnt get any new school clothes when school started so i might as get them now ya know? Well after the mall i'll come home and hopefully make contact with my friend Courtney who is supposed to be spending the night tonight and then going to church with me tomorrow. I'll probably watch some movies i got from Block Buster aka Block Blister...sorry inside joke...you know how those are. Well thats pretty much what ill do today. I might go to the marble slab but im not sure its pretty expensive. Oh by the way last night at Sertoma my school lost 14-0. What a way to start off the football season right? Well i gotta go finish cleaning and stuff. Much Love. Save the Whales!
