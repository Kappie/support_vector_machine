Most of the time, at least one parent speaks English, so they can then translate to their children the waterslide rules, however, the kids almost never speak English. As I discovered last night...  We were busy to begin with, our limit is 42 people max, and we had been at about 37 since noon. ("Why can't we sit here in the hot tub again? There's only 20 of us in here..." "Yes. That is exactly it. There are 20 of you in there. There is supposed to be 8!" - How is that even ccomfortable? Don't get me started. lol)  It is now 5:30. You have a nervous German kid, unsure of what to do... What will you do??  So we finally come to the conclusion that his father will catch him at the bottom of the slide, and after using a wide variety of hand gestures I got him to sit down on his bum and go down the slide. (No, you do not want to know the hand gestures I used! lol)  Well, I guess his bathing suit was sticking to the slide (This happens with some synthetic materials.. lol that was very technical.. thank you! lol *bows* -lol that was for you Mark.. lol) and I think he got scared, because he stood up (IN THE SLIDE!) and started grabbing the side of the slide, and kept looking down the middle, preparing to jump or something..and proceeded to WALK DOWN the slide (because apparently that was the answer...)  By this time, Adam is also at the bottom using a wide variety of hand gestures, trying to get the kid to sit back down on his bum to go down the slide. This didn't pan out so well.. (You think??) because there's water shooting down the slide.. when you add a kid walking down all that, it's not good.. so I had to shut off the slide and Adam had to climb in and get him. I was so worried he was going to jump.  Why are all these Germans here anyway?
