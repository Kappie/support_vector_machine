As we approached, we discovered that there was a senior picnic in full swing there--with real, octagenarian seniors, all in various stages of aging and mobility. They were dancing on the steps of Memorial. An ambulance (just in case!) was parked in front of Thayer.  I walked back from breakfast this morning to see a black truck parked near the steps of Memorial. It was labeled DEATHWISH, with creepy gold trim. I looked around to the side, and apparently DEATHWISH is the name of a piano moving company. I was slightly offended..."My piano was moved by deathwish!"  On a side note, I find it amusing that piano moving is actually a business. But when you think about it, it's so complex that it has to be. I try to remember, did they install our piano in pieces? Did they separate the legs? I don't remember, then.  Futher into the yard, I met a Japanese man in a half pirate/half Catholic schoolgirl costume. He had the boots and a little black pack with a gold emblem on it and an obvious pirate hat, but he was wearing a plaid skirt and a white blouse. Trailing behind him was an entourage of what appeared to be Japanese tourists. I thought, ok, people dressed up in Revolutionary-era clothing lead tours on the Freedom Trail, but a pirate/schoolgirl in the middle of Harvard Yard!  I'm really looking forward to journalism senior year.  I still have a headache and that crazy dizziness thing. I don't know what's wrong with me...might it be dehydration? Mom suggested that. I'm consuming a reasonable amount of food (in fact, more than reasonable!) and sugar at that. I'm not even taking the Tylenol Cold anymore. I think of all the creepy things I could have. Meningitis. West Nile (it's in Southern California!). I should stop being a hypochondriac and get on with life.  I got hit yesterday with a large amount of anthro work. I just finished the professor's book on the Runa. The fact that it has six "used" stickers and obvious liquid stains is cause for concern. I wonder if they'll take my copy back for a seventh go. The Ecuadorian Indians are even worse at "alphabet soup" than the New Deal. I still have an article to go in the coursepack, and then on to Calvino!  I'm still listening to the Strokes. I'll stop. Maybe. My roommates must think I'm neurotic since I listen to the same CD's over and over. At the beginning of SSP, it was Transatlanticism. Now it's the Strokes. Is This It? was on for a good part of yesterday, since I was stuck at the computer writing the paper...  Austin's getting home tomorrow from CTY. I wonder if Mom and Dad and Grandma miss not having kids around, but at least they don't have to feed us and take us everywhere and deal with cries of "Mom, I'm going out!" I'm sure this opinion's going to change, so I'll think about it now: Mom and Dad and Grandma are each special to me in their own special way. At least I get along with them most of the time now, though I can think of instances in the past when I was figuratively at war with all three of them. It's particularly nice to be so close to Grandma. I probably don't talk to her, etc. during the school year as much as I should.  A thought just popped up in my head: will Mom want to use my car more and more now that she's undertaking her after-school project? I don't want to compete with her. Grandma still likes to retain control of hers. I understand why Mom doesn't want to drive her good car, but I still have places to go too. Hm.  I'm actually wearing shoes today instead of flip flops. Yay for funny tan lines.  Time for more reading.
