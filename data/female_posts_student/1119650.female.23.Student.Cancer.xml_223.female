I've already gotten the room...now I'll be stuck at a rainy beach community for the whole weekend as it pours.  Oh well, I get to spend time with my Lisa anyhow, no biggie.  (c:  Someone I know, who I almost forged a relationship with has passed away.  He was in his early twenties.  Tonight is his wake.  I am going to be a support for one of my friends who was closer with him, but also to get some closure on the situation myself.  It doesn't seem quite real to me yet, but on the same hand I don't want to see him in the coffin, I don't know that I can handle seeing another body of a person my age in a casket.  I think I have to see it so I can stop being all deluded by it and try and get it off my mind, but its a scary thing.  Some people are using this as a really disgusting opportunity to further their own causes and shop for new clothing for themselves.  People like that make me want to scream.    Last night I dreamt that my mother was letting my father move back into our house.  He kept trying to talk to me and I was snide and cruel to him, I eventually just burst out into to tears and began kicking and screaming throwing a tantrum and commenting on how I don't need him and I've gotten this far with out him and I told him how great my life has been with out him.  I tried to move out, but I ended up homeless just like he had been.  God, I hate him.  Rain, rain, go away, come again some other day.
