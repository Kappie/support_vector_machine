I'll tell him all about Xavier and how he asked me out and I wasn't interested but I told him I'd think about it that one night we went bowling, and how I walked him to his door when we dropped him off and he kissed me (yes, he kissed me. No, I didn't kiss him back. He caught me off guard.) and how I went home and cried and bawled because I felt so horrible for even letting that happen and I knew how he would have taken it. He would've taken it like any boyfriend. He would've freaked out. And everyone that I've told said that as long as I didn't do anything wrong but...somehow I've developed a conscience between last week and yesterday and I feel...horrible.
