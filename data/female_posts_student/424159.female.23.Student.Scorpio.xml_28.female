Not only did Tobey McGuire look totally hot in that tight suit, but the plot, the action, and the acting were excellent.  Jake would disagree, saying that the movie was "allright", but that's ok.  They picked an awesome cast for the movie.  Wonder if they'll make a sequel?  I hope so!  Rating:  5/5 stars!  *****    urlLink The Official Movie Website
