Lawrence carried me some of the way back to Marissa's and it was putting a bit of stress on my arms, but I dunno if that's why. It's the only thing I can think of... Anyway...Cody came by today to visit Cindy.. We all hung down at the laundry mat. Jojo was there too, or I probally would've bored myself to death. Hmm, I'm naming all these people you people dunno, so... let's see here...{1.)Cindy- My best friend...or supposed to be...let's just call her one of my best friends. My girlfriend. LoLz.}{2.)Jojo- My ex bf, still the love of my life tho..Another best friend..and he's MINE!! All mine....}{3.)Cody- One of many of Cindy's bf's..well, ex bf's. Just a friend. Altho he text messages and calls me. Yet, he's like 5 yrs older than I am.. Well, 3 or 4. Maybe 5.}{4.)Marissa- My, I guess you'd call her my ex best friend.. my wifee. She's still one of my best friends, we go waaaaaay back...}{5.)Lawrence- One of Matthew's friends, Marissa's ex. He's got a g/f from what I've heard, but I don't know her, He should bring her to church sometime.}Ah, yes...And church...where everything began...Many people would probally read this and be like "Yeah, church...*Sigh* Boring ol' church. Church sux" But nooo, not mine. Our youth group's the stuff... :P~~~ yes, I said "the stuff", cuz I don't cuss, used to...REAL BAD...Ask Marissa, lolz, but now, I don't see any point in it. It's stupid, really. Alot of ppl think I'm crazy for it, yeah. I am. But my friends...my REAL friends.. They stuck with me after I gave up all that crud.hey, whatever. ANYway.... Me and Marissa got bored at her house, so we decided to go to Matts. He wasn't home at first so we went by Lawrence and Shannon's house, didn't knock or anything, she was just showing me where they lived {6.)Shannon- Lawrence's younger brother. He doesn't come to church as often as Shannon does or anything, but I know him enough to play around and joke with him. }. After we past their house...after being honked at about 5 million times, we went to Fashion Cent and looked at a buncha clothes there.Then, Marissa called Matthew again and he answered this time. She told him that we were comming over and he said it might not be such a good idea to come over because Chalind was going to be comming over too. Plus, Shawn was there. {7.) Chalind- Another guy, met thru Matthew. Reminds me of a teddy bear.} {8.) Shawn- Yet another guy met thru Matthew. He's like a teddy bear too, cept he's more of a big scary bodyguard teddybear..if you can picture that...}. Well, I had to talk to Matthew and tell him that I hated that Chalind was mad at me...It didn't seem right. He's never been mad at me before...Whatever. We went anyway, I wanted to make up with Chalind. He's goin out with Tatiana now, I heard. {9.)Tatiana- Another chick from church I've known for a while... She just recently came back for VBS at church..Didn't see her after that..}. We got there, yadda yadda yadda.....Played video games while Marissa and Matt were in his room and junk. Lawrence kept whoopin up on me and Shawn in Dead or Alive..We won like 3 times, big whoop. But, hey whatever, had to go home and All 3 of the guys decided to walk us home. Lawrence decided he wanted to carry me...His mistake..Or so I thought. He carried my big behind to the park. Then, Shawn was talkin some junk about me gettin married or somethin.. So, I got bothered and told him to tell me who I was supposed to be getting married to, and he said "Remember, you said how bout I (I forgot what he said here) yadda yadda yadda, and I said how bout I meet you at the chapel instead?" So obviously implying He said he was gonna marry me...or something.. Well, anyway, got back to Marissa's .... yadda yadda yadda... Alena was gonna drive me home and Marissa up to her step mama's house...She decided to tell Shawn, Matt, and Lawrence to hop in the car so she could give them a ride back to Matt's too...*sigh*. 4 of us (From Left to Right-Matthew, Marissa, Me, Lawrence) Thank God Shawn wasn't in the back seat...of that lil Honda. I was tryin so hard to get on Marissa's lap, ended up on Lawrence's instead. Felt so bad, cuz he's got a g/f, and I've got Jojo. It felt..dirty...is that wrong? Yadda yadda yadda, everything else went smoothly...I never want to sit on his lap again tho, lolz. I'll stick with Jojo's.I got home and went outside after tennis, heard that Jojo went with Frank and his Mom (Franks Mom, that is). I was like "Wait a minute, he wanted me to meet him when I got home, why would he go out?" Whatever. Bobby told me he saw them leave. {10.Frank- One of my neighborhood friends... Big guy, Love him tho, he likes my teams,he's one of my big bro's..Rock on!!} {11.)Bobby- Rather weird neighborhood friend...Big blue eyes..man, can't really explain him. He's sweet, but never....Never.} Even Matthew and Christopher told me Jojo had left with Frank and his Mom, so I just gave up {12.)Matthew and Christopher- Brothers of Jojo and Cindy. Their awesome. It's cool cuz both of their b-day's are on March 1, yet their a year apart. Matthew's 9, Christopher's 8, heh..} Me and Bobby were walkin down the street, met up with Maya...and with her, was the lil brat...Max. {13.)Maya- Friend from skool, Love her ta death, I own her, she owns me..It's all good...She's a giggle-ball} {14.)Max-Lil brat..he's like, 8 or 9.. Threw my CareBear over the fence. EVIL lil kid, lolz.} Bobby left, I walked with Max and Maya, walked Max home, found out that his lil 5 yr old bro, Brandon was missing.{15.)Brandon- One of the cutest lil kids in the world!!! I dunno what happened to his 15 yr old bro, Brett, He doesn't look like him at all...} So, we went out lookin for lil ol Brandon, yadda yadda yadda...walkin around the whole neighborhood...lookin for him.. Walked Max back home, they'd found Brandon. I get a text from Jojo for me to come outside... Here's me.. thinking "Wait a minute, when'd he get home?" Then, here comes Bobby around the corner, "Jojo wants you". So, I raced Bobby to him and Jojo said "So, I heard you were at Chiko's." WWWWHHHHAAAAATTTTT...but I only said that in my head.. Started a big fight...yadda yadda yadda...We got over it...about 10 minutes later... Mom was gettin paranoid again, probally thinkin I was outside alone with Jojo.....*clears throat*.. which I was, but that's beside the point..Frank came later. Hmmm, I think that's about it. Me and Mom got in a fight about Gay ppl. Said since we're christian's we shouldn't accept it or something. Said she used to be gay/bi, whatever, and that the topic was something she felt strong about. Said I should hate the fact that their gay, not them. I'll have to get more info on that now...Whatever...Not sure how to feel about it all. Anyway..That ends my night, I guess. I'm gonna hurt Brent...Really.`'`'`'`'`'`'`'I told you I write alot...'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`:P~~~~~~~*~KrIsTeN~*~xxo, XXO, xxo, XXO, Which do you prefer? Big, or Small??????
