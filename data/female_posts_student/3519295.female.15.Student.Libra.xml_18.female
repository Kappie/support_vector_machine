The nights are long  And I am left while the tears fall.  Did you think that I would cry,on the phone?  Do you know what it feels like,being alone?  I'll find someone new  Swing, Swing, Swing  from the tangles of  My heart is crushed by a former love  Can you help me find a way  To carry on again.  Wish cast into the sky  I'm moving on  Sweet beginnings do arise  [HE]knows[HE] was wrong  The notes are old,  They bend,  they fold  and so do I to a new love.  Bury me  ([I] thought[MY] problems were gone)  Carry me  (away. away, away...)    I DON'T KNOW (FIRST, WHY I'M TYPING IN CAPS...IT'S FUN, THOUGH.) IF I TWEEKED TYSON RITTER'S WORD TO RELATE TO FRANKIE OR NATE, BUT YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS BETTER WHEN I'M SINGING OUT LOUD BECAUSE I DON'T SOUND LIKE A TOTAL LESBIAN OR ANYTHING...  SO, MEIKE, I'M SUPER GLAD THAT YOU'RE BACK.  I RECRUITEDBRYAN TO THE BLOGGING WORLD, JUST AS U RECRUITED ME, MEIKE. I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IF HE'LL EVER GET ON IT AGAIN, THOUGH, SO I CAN STILL CALL HIM A MAN-SKANK AND NOT FEEL LIKE HE'S READING IT.    OH, I BROKE DOWN LAST NIGHT AND RANG FRANKIE. WE'RE GOING...ON A WALK...AT NINE, SO I DON'T KNOW... I THINK I'M GONNA TRY TO PSYCHOANALYZE HIM AND THE HYPNOTIZE HIM AND MAKE HIM ASK ME OUT ON AN ACTUAL FACTUAL DATE. THE THINGS HE MAKES ME WANNA DO...I'D KNOCK OVER A QUICK-E-MART FOR HIM...(RANDOM TWEEKED INSERT FROM AN ATARIS SONG.)    I WANT TO BE WITH HIM SO BAD. IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S BEEN A MAJOR CHARACTER IN MY DREAMS FOR THE PAST WEEK.    OH, AND, NATE IS AN AWESOME GUY, BUT I'VE FINALLY REALIZED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT'LL EVER HAPPEN BETWEEN US IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON A FOLDED UP PIECE OF COLLEGE-RULED LOSE-LEAF THREE HOLE PUNCHED PIECE OF PAPER BETWEEN THE DESKS IN THE DIRTY GERMAN ROOM, AND THAT THE SEXUAL TENSION IN THOSE NOTES CAN BE CUT LIKE BUTTER...OR AT LEAST ERASED BY AN ERASER.  MAN, I AM SO DEEP.......AND HOT.  I DON'T KNOW WHYI DON'T HAVE GUYS THROWING THEMSELVES AT ME. DO YOU, MEIKE? HM...MAYBE I NEED A FEW MORE PARTS EGO IN MY SOCCERGODDESS77-MILKSHAKE. (SEE OLDER BLOG ENTRIES.)  YOU GUYS KNOW I'M JUST KIDDING, RIGHT? (OR AM I?)
