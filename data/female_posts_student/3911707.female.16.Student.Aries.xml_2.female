Kat just called me not too long ago and informed me that she's for sure pregnant. She went to the doctor and she's about 7 weeks along. Wow. She just turned 17, but at least she waited until she was married. When I told Pat, his reaction was, "already!? They just got married." Oh well, I'm happy with her, it's exciting. Chris is hoping it's a girl, but I'm sure he'll love the baby no matter what. I made plans with Kat for Saturday, because I totally forgot that it's her weekend off and I already made plans for Friday with Pat.  I sense it to be another night of staying home. Not because I want to, but because I have nothing to do. Ugh.
