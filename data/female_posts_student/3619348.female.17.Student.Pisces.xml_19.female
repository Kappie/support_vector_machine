Anyways, I got off at about 12:45p.m. and fell into bed.  The alarm went off at 5:00a.m. and I out I went, walking.  It had just stopped raining and the air was steamy, but I didnâ€™t mind.  There were water droplets on the end of all the leaves, it looked like they had been coated with glass.  It was gorgeous.  Eh, so yeah, I walked again.
