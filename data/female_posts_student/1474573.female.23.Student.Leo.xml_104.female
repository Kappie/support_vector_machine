It's not ready for  full coming out party and I have to go over some of the poems I have there because they might be old versions of somethings but damn I finally have the elusive  urlLink WEBSITE!  For now it's being hosted on the newschool server and who knows how long that's going to last. Guy, you can finally delete those e-mails cuz you should be able to access what I sent you on the website. (check first though ) I want it to be this online library of my writings as well as those I think should be readily availble. It's mostly for me but y'all should have a good time and it's a good a thing to have after a show , when people want copies. It's not all that it could be just yet but soon there will be a merchandises page , picture page, movie reviews, maybe even a webcam....the thing is it's there so enjoy.... there will be a guestbook soon
