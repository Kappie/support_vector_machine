(not really, hes married and has children.) soo anyways we got to pack the cars back up and i hugged them all goodbye. jon was sweaty, joe smelled good, andy was hot and joel was trying to whip me with a towel. they drove the cutest minivans. ever. we were inside after and andy pulled up and i opened the door and he yells "hey we're getting some food want anything?" (note- this is during the famine) so i yelled "come on dont even" and then he said im just kidding.. and then he drove a little and then he said actually im not. that was the last i saw of them. ya know ill post again the rest cuz this is so long.
