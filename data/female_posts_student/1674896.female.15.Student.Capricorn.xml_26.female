HAH!! its not like she ever has a chance with him anyway. shes like, "admired him from a far" for like a century. the girl wont even speak to him. lordy. ok so, whats new with you?? oh yeah? thats great!! i love that kind. ... ... so yeah i think im gonna go listen to some a' that grand ol' FRANZ FERDINAND musica!!! byebye
