We tryed to figure out songs for our band..that never goes well. I think we have one song on the list, good job kids. Then we decided to act like moe-rons, and try snowboarding, even though we have no snow only mud. Then we played twister for like 3 hrs. omfg my knee hurts like a damn mofo!  It's so cold outside. I hate the cold. I hate hamburgers. I hate peppers. Yeah, now what.  I dont want to go back to school tomarrow. Nope I dont. I like the weekends. Sleep. Food. Music. How much more fun could it get. Besides not having to do fucking mid-term reviews that the bitchass teachers give us.  The parentals are bugging me about college already. They wanna know what im gonna major in, what school I wanna go to, tuiton costs...I have no clue. I want to go somewhere in New York City, Like NYU. I want to do advertising layouts for people, like musicians. That way I get to meet awesome people, and yet I get paid good money. What more could you want? I wish I lived in Cocoa Beach. That way I could surf all the time, and be really good at it. And it would rarely ever get tooooo cooold. Oh well. Not like anyone is reading this besides you. Not like anyone cares. But oh well. I dont care anymore.
