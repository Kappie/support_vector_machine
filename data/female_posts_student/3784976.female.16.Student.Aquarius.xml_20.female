Today, I was sitting on the couch singing a song about my other nephew, Rylan. It went like this:   I don't like baby boys I don't like baby boys Especially thefat ones!  No, he really is chubby, but he is kind of cute!Just kidding, he is cute. Anyway, I got a new stereo for in my bathroom tonight. It is so small, but it is really neat. And something else happened today, but I can't remeber what it was. Oh wait, I remember, but I can't say. You guys wouldn't understand it anyway! I have nothing else to say right now, except for I can't wait until Saturday. Yaaaahoooooooooo, Cedar Point!  Hasta la vista...baby! Kate
