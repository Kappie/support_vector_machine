Unless one counts watching Match Game on the Game Show Network.  Interestingly enough, I was watching this last night (actually very early this morning) and there was this woman on there from my hometown.  I wish I could remember her name.  But when they each did their little bios of themselves that they give at the beginning, she introduced herself as being 23 years old, and just as I was thinking how this was odd, because I am also 23, she then introduced herself as being from Gulfport, Mississippi.  And I thought...wow.  Of course, this episode was over 20 years old, so she'd be my mother's age now, but still it would have been cool if I could have caught or remembered her name, since you never know...
