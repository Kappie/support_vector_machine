I woke up at 11 because I was not feeling good. I had some bad pains. I didn't get to go to the funeral either because I could not walk and I felt so sick! I didn't have a lot of energy. I was so tired today that I ended up staying home all day! I watched TV and I played alot of games! I am tired of sitting at home. I am actually going to Crossroads tomorrow! It will be weird because I have not been there in SO LONG! I hope it isn't too awkward! Tomorrow, my mom and I are gonna go to Lytle and try to see if we can see my brother! I guess then after that, I am gonna go to Sea World and watch the Fireworks! Woo-Hoo! I hope I am feeling ok to go though! I hope I am atleast feeling a lot better! School is so close! I wish it wasn't! I REALLY don't wanna go back. I am not excited about going back to O'Connor! I miss Taft! I wish I was keeping touch with all my friends! I think I have lost alot of them. YEAH-My hair has a grown a little. Not a lot, but hey-I am getting there. I am so tempted to cut it! I hate my hair. It's like I dont have a stlye! UGH...suck a nut! I have not been excercising like I had been wanting to. I get so lazy! I hope I can get fit soon. I don't wanna be all fat! So yuppers-I wanna hear "Roses". I love that song. I don't even know why! All I know is that I really like it! Everytime it comes on, I start singing and dancing! YEAH :o) Okay then, I probaly need to get to bed early tonight since I have to wake up Early. Nighty Night...Love you...M U A H xoxo
