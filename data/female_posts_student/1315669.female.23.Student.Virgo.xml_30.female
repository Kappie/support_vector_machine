Flashbacks of the 9 semesters revision suddenly bombard my puny brain and suddenly, I'm so lost. Eh, don't blame me. This farking helluva long half a decade of my life is suddenly just over. Actually well.. *shuffles uncomfortably*  It isn't THAT suddenly. It was more of..wow..I wished upon my stars as I begged and pleaded, that I can no longer study for the most stupdious, nonsensical, abnoxious and soundless idea that cramping 4 months of work within 4 days into the puny brain and reguigitating the info out as required and ur destiny being determined within the nextg 2 hours of your life is totally ..*BULLSHIIITTT* Life is so mundane and so redundant this way. Damn, I'm getting nostalgia at this moment in time which no other relative or even remotely close gets near to mah mah.....
