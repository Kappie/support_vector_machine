Now that's not a bad thing but it may get on peoples nerves when I do do this. Also I'm not using my real name. Just for seceurity stuff, I'm not trying to be mean by not telling you my real name but I'm doing it for my own security. But  I can tell you my age, I'm 16, and I'm going to be 17 in November. I'm going to be a junior in high school this coming September.         I'm also going to be yaking about my arts + crafts stuff, I really like to knit aand draw, but I also love to read about physics and stuff like that. I'm trying to go to this knitting group near me, but it's on monday nights and I have drivers ed on moday nights until the middle of August. But hopefully when I get the time I'll go.      Well, that's all for know, I may write later tonight if something interesting happens. I'm going to an event at my local library and it's "Meet a Video Game Desighner". So I may write, type, w/e about it later.
