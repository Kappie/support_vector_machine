(the match!) also noticed wat a gorgeous color he's wearing under his tunic thing. its like a light  metalic purple. its so pretty. would kill for a dress same color. in fact, i plan on designing my own dress for next fd dance. either based on legolas's costume or perhaps a version of arwens. she's so pretty. i want to b liv tyler. k. if i dont finish this science stuff tonite i think he'll no for a fact i havnt been doing the homework. he wore a cowboy hat today. thank god i didnt hav science today. i wouldnt stopped laughing.
