And I guess I can comprehend why he is acting the way he is. But I don't *understand*. I am just a girl, and no one needs to worry about me.  Marie keeps telling me not to worry about these little things, but I do. I worry about a lot, but I have reason to. Things always get spoiled, so I take extra precaution these days. Who can blame me for wanting to keep what I've got?
