I use so many short cuts for things but the tests don't accept these as proper responses.  I was hardly thrilled with my evaluation- it was marginal at best.  Oh well, despite the hindrance, at least I have an appointment to start training in like a week.  Don't know if I'll be getting paid for that time (a whole 8 hours, blechhh!), but I DO know that the rate of pay after that is $18 an hour... Can we say new car for Annie!!!  In other news, I am still completely bored here.  New York is not nearly as much when you're broke.  There's plenty of things that I would like to do in the city, however my dwindling bank account forces me to opt for spending more time playing Lingo online.   urlLink The Game Show Network  is a pretty good way to pass the time, though.  I must admit that Lingo is quite addictive!  That and  urlLink [adult swim]  keep me sane... Or is it insane?!  Who knows!  More later...   *me*
