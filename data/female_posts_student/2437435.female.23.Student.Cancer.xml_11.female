It reminds me of the Jainas in India. They practice extreme measures of faith and live extremely aesthetically. They eat once a week and spend most of their days meditating. When they walk, they even sweep with a small broom the organisms in front of them as to not step on them. They believe this because on a person's body there are millions upon millions of cells and Jainas believe that each cell has it's own soul and is on the path to liberation (the highest form is humans). So the act of bathing, scratching, moving, etc is killing of souls and is violence. They are truly the only non-violent religion. At any rate, I have a wonderful view of this hillside with raspberries, trees, grass and flowers. As I looked into the menagerie of vegetation, I thought how only a thin piece of glass and a screen held me back from a world (for the most part) untouched by man's hands.   I have probably mentioned my analogy for life already, but I think it's worth noting. Life is like the hottest summer day. The only relief in sight is a semi-long walk to the seaside or pool... There are 2 kinds of people. Those people who will walk regardless of anything because they know what they want and will accomplish their goals. Then there are people who will sit inside or under a tree and wonder what could have been or criticize the others.
