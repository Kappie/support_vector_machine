But it went ok, well, anyway, here's the story...  She picked me up from Anil's and we went to  urlLink Bistro 990  for lunch, which of course was fabulous.  "If you're going to be getting into the business, you've gotta know where the hotspots are," she tells me.  Apparently the Top of the Hyatt is also a big pub-house hotspot, but that's not where I was, so I don't care about that.   urlLink Gary Busey  was seated at the table next to us, my Aunt swore she overheard some book-talk going on.  She said that the story is, years ago, some publisher brought Mordecai Richler to the Bistro and after that it's been the place to go to sign all the sure-things.  I took this as a good, scratch that,  great  omen.  Would you like to play something called "tickle and pee." ("I tickle you and if you pee you win a set of luggage, a chocolate bunny and some Halloween lips.")  Aunt Colleen was clear: she couldn't necessarily offer me a job, but she could dress me up and take me out whorin' to all the publishing houses in the GTA, she'd take me to trade show orgies, and my business cards would be as popular as herpes.  Oh yeah: the pay is apparently terrible for the first couple of years.  Just terrible!  I think I'd make more at my current job...?  Maybe a liiiittle bit more.  Goddam I'm gonna starve.  The lunch itself, like the food, was also outstanding.  I'm gonna marry the dessert... or maybe the chef?  Had a couple glasses of wine, too, and good stuff--none of this "Growers" nonsense!  And left that place feeling a little buzzed.    Later, Anil picked me up (somewhat reluctantly???) with some chick friend of his -- she was pretty and nice, and was overall just pretty nice -- and we went to some place in Yorkville for lunch.  I just had wine.  Then we walked all the fuck over, and when we got back to his place I was friggin exhausted.  I passed out on the couch, woke up in bed and it was dark.  I had to work the next morning, so I told him I had to go.  Originally, the plan was that I was gonna leave after my lunch, but he promised to drive me home if I stayed until later.  But all of a sudden he was being a huuuuge biatch, telling me he wasn't going to let me leave.  So I started packing up, figuring he'd snap out of it, and he just sulked.  It was 10, so I knew if I took the train I wasn't even going to get back to the station until 11:30, forget how the heck was I gonna get from the train station to home with nary a dollar in my wallet.  But that was it, he was bent on being a bitch, so I didn't wait too long.    It was a long wait at the station.  It's always a long wait at the station, and the train was full of creepies.  The train is always full of creepies, especially late at night.  I managed to get a cab--pure luck.  Getting closer to home, I asked the cabbie to take me to a bank machine near my house; the fare was already $11, so I was like, fuck this, I'll walk.  But I only walked 10 feet and the cabbie offered to take me the rest of the way no charge.  I wish good karma on that guy.  Anil left me a message "apologizing" and it made me gag.  It was forced, contrived, it was like he called one of his friends and they told him what to say.  Fuck, I don't get him.  We get along great on the phone, but one-on-one there's just something missing.  I dunno.  It's like he craves the wanting and not the object, and of course he's just used to getting what he wants.  Asshole...meh.  Really, if he's the "rebound guy", which he is, this really is only temporary.  I'm starting to wonder just how much longer I'm really gonna tolerate this bullshit.  And I complained about Brent!  Yikes!  My sister never talks about Jeff anymore.  Never.  It must kill her to have that part of her life so separate from the rest of the family.  She doesn't tell us when she's hanging out with him, he doesn't call the house, yet they still hang out constantly!  Mom and I had a terrible talk the other day.  She doesn't believe that two people who were at one time very serious about each other can ever be friends after the break-up.  She thinks it's just a tease.  I disagree.  I saw Brent last week when he just "showed up" at the mall (how friggin' coincidental, especially since he called my house first,) and we had a pretty casual chat.  It was a little weird at first, and he slipped and called me "baby".  I won't say it didn't hurt a little.  And then he left, abruptly, to go and meet up with his friends.  "But you can call my cell anytime" he tells me.  Yeah, Mr. Social Freakin' Butterfly.  WTF?  I guess the bottom-line is that we're both alive and well.  He got into school, he's getting a place, and hopefully he'll still be getting his bike this summer.  Hopefully his parents won't find out about that part, and ruin it for him.  In a lot of ways (some that I feel really guilty about) I'm almost glad that we've split up and I don't have to deal with his parent's shit anymore.  I mean, fuck, I have to deal with enough shit from my own parents, and then his too?!  My parents never caused any shit for him, at least none that he didn't deserve.  Seeing Brent last week made me miss him so much.  I really want to call him, or show up, or even just send him a text so he knows I'm thinking about him.  But none of that's a good idea.  He doesn't need to know, just like I don't need to know what he's thinking about, because it would not be conducive to maintaining the very amicable silence that we've cultivated.  Yes, very amicable.  Well, I'll have to get in touch with him sooner or later to see about getting back some of that camping equipment.
