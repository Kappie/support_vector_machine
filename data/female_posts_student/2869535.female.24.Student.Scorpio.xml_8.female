The other day, Kim was hit by a car....it was tragic...but funny. She didn't get hurt or anything....it was some old woman driving....really slow....well....this woman needed new glasses....and when she hit kim she got out of the car and asked if the cat was ok. SO i was like "hey lady, that was no cat! That was my friend!" She was a little upset...then she went into how they would send her back to the old folks home if we told on her. So...we let her run wild and free...but we did make her promise to buy new glasses. So we got her number and we called her the next day....welll....she answered and she was breathing all heavy so i was like Mildred...whats wrong...and this old lady...like 80 years old....started telling me how she was having sex w the lawn man. I was like "Mil, how old IS he? She told me 50...."so i says to Mildred, I says Mildred....thats just nasty..he is young enough to be your son" so she says to me she says....WELL I am paying him well and tipping him!" So needless to say....kimmy got hit by an old granny perve. more to come later....
