An example of this is the whole shady transaction made when we bought this house.  The person is now having to pay for his shadiness (for lack a non-vulgar word).  That is why I TRY to think before I spew my mouth off or do drastic things.  Is it wrong to believe in karma?  LOL  So anyway after further thought I feel sorry for people who go through bad karma.  Life is not pleasant for them.  My poor (quite literally by the way...you know I love ya Leila) sister got news from the school.  It seems she has reached the limit on units attempted.  I still think she should appeal because dammit, 30 units in Chinese...that isn't her fault.  LOL  I think she might be bale to pull it off especially since she only really needs one more semester.   I on the other hand may need a year to finish everything at the GE level.  All because my other school said I was ready when I wans't.  So I have all these other courses to take care of.  THANKS!  Thus is my life, school and school.  I have to go to bed now.  Gotta wake up early to take the kiddos to a WIC appointment (the milk, eggs and cheese help a lot) and then to a doctor's appointment so they are ready to go for school.  WISH US LUCK!  UGH
