Today at school, I had a very traumatizing morning.  I was injured!  This girl thought she could get through the doorway the same time I could and ended up pushing me into the pushy bar to open up the door on account of she was much bigger than I am.  My poor hand got a huge mark on it and swelled up all morning.  Now, I am left with a mark and it hurts!  This afternoon I brought Jessica home and it took us around a half hour just to get out of the parking lot.  UGH!  Tonight, my mom made me to the dishes while she and my day went to my brother's band concert.  When she came back, I had everything done except the silverware that had peanut butter all over them.  So she asked me or rather yelled, why I didn't do the ones with peanut butter on them.  My response, "Those ones were icky!"  But you see I did attempt them, but the smell of the disgusting peanut butter was overwhelming and I couldn't take it anymore.  I hate peanut butter!  It's sometimes okay with chocolate and sometimes okay on toast but otherwise it is just gross.  My mom then proceeded on to say, what if my roommate in college liked peanut butter?  I answered, "Then she can eat it outside."  But she couldn't leave it alone, she added, "What about your kids, are you going to deprive them of peanut butter just because you don't like it?"  My come back, "Yes."  Now, don't get your undies in a bunch I won't deprive my kids of peanut butter, but I won't buy it willingly!    Oh, Oh, Oh, I had a really, really, good third period today!  You can ask if you want, but just know it was good.  Night  ~Kay
