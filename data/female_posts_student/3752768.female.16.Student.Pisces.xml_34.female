We hung out until the party and Ryan ate all the cheesecake and checked out the freshmen girls. Yeah it was fun. Lol. I love Ryan he makes me laugh! We had balloon fights...I got into a fight with Kyle and that wasnt fun. Well yeah it was fun and I LOVE RYAN!  Today I went to work at Cazones.... It was pretty fun I met a new friend named Brandon.
