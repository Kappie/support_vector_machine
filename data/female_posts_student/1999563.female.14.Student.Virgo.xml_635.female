But, then again, I am in no sense normal. I don't really want to be a normal kid or anything. What's the fun in that?? I mean normal kids don't run across train tracks a minute before a trains crosses just for a thrill. A normal kid would never tear off those "Do not remove under penalty of law" tags on blow dryers. But, come on, why would I use a blow dryer while taking a bath?! It defies all senses of human competence.    Speaking of blow dryers....I had to go to wal-mart today to get one. This was my second time in 3 days going there!! Cuh-razyyy!! Wal-mart kinda scares me at times. Like today this street guy followed me... Then all the normal wal-mart shoppers glare at me where ever I go. I always smile at them but I guess they can't even look at a girl who wears real adidas shoes. AI wish I could just go into wal-mart and give each and every one of those people there a brand new pair of the nicest shoes money can buy, but, I cannot. So, instead I just smile.  I know, who would want a smile instead of a new pair of shoes, but it's the least I can do.  So I picked out the cheapest blow dryer that would actually blow dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. It's like the Rembrandt 1385 or some group of fancy sounding numbers. It's not the best blow dryer but I am short on cash. Then I had to get this braces cleaning tool because I left my other one on the plane. I actually ended up buying three because they only come in packages of three. I also bought some shaving cream! Hahahha.  Speaking of shaving...So, a couple days ago I went into the shower in a total daze. I started shaving and I was like wait a second..Something is wrong. And instead of shaving cream I was using shampoo! Haha! It was odd.  After picking out all my necessary items I went into this line. It looked like the shortest but it turned out to be really long. I was right behind this guy who was getting mad at everything. The poor lady ran out of coins so she had to get more and this man was like "Could you move ANY slower???" I was like "Whoa, Nellie! Do you want change? Then your going to have to wait!" then she was having problems loading the change so she had to get this other lady to help her. The man just stood there with his arms crossed anxiously tapping his foot.  Then it finally was his turn! He breathed a sigh of relief and placed his sleeping bag and sun block on the counter. Then, this poor lady, she couldn't get the sleeping bag to scan correctly. He said "It's $9.83, okay??" right after he said that it scanned. The price showed up as "$9.97" "Well, I deserve those 14 cents." "Are you a Washington resident?" the cashier said. We get that a lot. We are close to the border. Oregon residents don't have to pay sales tax, us Washingtonians do.   "I'm a Washington resident and proud!!!" The man said quite loudly.  It seems like a lot of Americans have this problem. We are proud to be from here but we don't put our pride good use. Maybe if this man was truly proud to live in this beautiful state he should try to make it a better place. It's not like he had to save the forest or anything. All he had to do to make a big change is just  be patient with the cashier.  If we are proud to be American we should get involved. I know you hear this a lot from everyone... But there isn't much to it! Maybe if you see trash on the side of the sidewalk throw it away. Smile at everyone. Give a quarter to a homeless person. Do whatever.  But really, all we have to do is just love others.
