Believe me, in addition to being an Ohio native, having half my high school class at OSU, and having people from my high school on the ol' BUckeyes team... I still had alterior motives for cheering for the Bucks (ohmigod, what if my interviewer was a big fan and gets pissed off if the bucks lose??). Anyway, it was a bizzare scare, but it prompted me to watch the entire game and i loved every minute of it. FOr those of you who saw it, you definitely know why. A nail-biter to the very finish!  Other interviews I've got lined up are Wash U, WRight State, Vanderbilt, and CWRU. I don't have a first choice really. Pretty much whoever will pay me the most to go to their school (weighed by their academic reputation also and whether or not I get into MD/PhD somewhere).   IN the meantime, being healthy again is so nice that I have been spending all my time planning and dreaming and organizing all the "cool fun stuff" that i missed last semester. Hey, theres always time for make-up fun! I want to travel this summer, and read a lot of books that I have been putting off, do a lot of research, volunteer, etc. Theres a ton of things that I have missed doing and right now it feels like the pull is every direction.  BUt luckily, Dan keeps me (relatively) sane with all these futuristic goals and helps me enjoy these moments that we have as seniors. Its also exciting that a lot of my pals from last year that were gone fall semester have returned, so lots to share and catch up on yet.   Well, thats all for now I guess, have a lot of reading to do and work first thing in the morning (I guess morning is going to creep up soon enough since its already 5:30 am! yikes!)
