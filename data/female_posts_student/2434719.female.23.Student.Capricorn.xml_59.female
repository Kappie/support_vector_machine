FOOD IS ALWAYS A GOOD TOPIC.  you know i eat the same thing for breakfast every single day, right?  you know i'm an old lady, right? GO LEAN CEREAL with BANANA, BLUEBERRIES, and SOY MILK. and none of this dried up fruit in a box. i like the real stuff.  old lady, i told ya.  unless jason says it.  then i'm not.
