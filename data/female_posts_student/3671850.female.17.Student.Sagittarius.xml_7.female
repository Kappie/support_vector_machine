I like spending time with "Linda", lol, I even got her to dance in the car with me... to some Gigalo  (gasp).I got some clothes and a bookbag today. I bought some "plan of attack" jeans.. waaaa haaa haaa. lol. I did miss my buds today though. My mom and I sawthe  Bourne Supremacy  it was a good action film, but i prefer the drama/comedy. I wonder what Jess and Blake did on there lil' date... can't wait to hear the juice. :)   Song of the day: Let it Bump by missy elliot. This song was playing while I was  shoppin  in AE today, and it reminds meof my favorite dance at  Chad's recital  :)   Sorry myposts are soooo short.. but not much happens with me. ~Meg
