Sometimes the people attitude is just unacceptable.   As in my case, I have some classmate who is irresponsible. They do not care about other people's feeling. What a selfish person they are. While we were doing experiment in the Laboratory this morning, one of my friend and I were the one who readied the apparatus for the experiment, but they were the people who did the experiment. They refuse to get the apparatus from the back of the Laboratory and they do the experiment without giving much time to other member in the group the experiment, we are the ones who clean up the place but they are the ones who leave first without glancing back. I hope one day they will change their attitude. ......!!  The form 5 librarians do not seem to accept my explanation. They have prejudice towards the Form 4 librarians. Some of them heard that the Form 4 librarians stab us in the back. Ai... Why should we care about that? Those were just rumours. Let's just concentrate on our studies and look up for the party. Instead of having bad mood everyday, why don't we take it easy?
