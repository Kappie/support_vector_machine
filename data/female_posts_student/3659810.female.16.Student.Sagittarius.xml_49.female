I don't even know why i feel like this, its not like anyone really ignored me today, maybe i just need alot of attention like a puppy.... hmm i don't like that...... dead puppy? i can't really imagine how much attention a dead puppy needs..... how about just an evil puppy.... hmmm.. something still doesn't fit..... i'm an evil puppy with fireball eyes.... and....and.... a wagging tail of doom... okay....maybe I need alot of attention like an evil puppy with fireball eyes and a wagging tail of doom.  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
