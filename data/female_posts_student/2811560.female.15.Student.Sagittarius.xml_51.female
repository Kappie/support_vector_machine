And then Emily, Bob, Melanie, Jasmine, Paul and I went to see Shrek 2. It was really cute, I had a really good time. And then we had to go to dinner for my brother's birthday. Yeah, I honestly don't think it could have been any worse. My Mom made a huge scene because the waiter didn't tell her there wasn't free refills. Then she told him that she wouldn't give him a tip if he didn't take all the extra drinks off our bill. Ugh. I don't understand why people just can't relax and let things go. Whether or not you pay a couple extra bucks for drinks is not going to impact your life that much. Plus, what really made me angry is that she was proud of the fact that she made a huge deal of everything and then got her way. I'll never be like that. Yeah and I guess my Mom told my Grandma that Paul was coming over tomorrow, and she goes "So your boyfriends coming over tomorrow?". Um, no. And if you bring it up one more time, I will throw my iced tea in you face. Lol, I was in a bad mood the whole time. Anyways, marching band tomorrow morning. Hopefully people will learn to tell their left foot from their right so I don't have to scream "LEFT! LEFT! LEFT!" the whole time. Oh well. Paul's coming over tomorrow, yay. We're going to watch The Breakfast Club. Fun stuff.
