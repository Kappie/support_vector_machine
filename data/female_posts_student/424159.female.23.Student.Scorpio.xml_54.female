While waiting to leave, I decided to check my Yahoo! and OSU mail accounts.  My OSU mail popped up and I found an e-mail that changed my life.  My future is now prospectively laid out for me, and, well, what I'm trying to say is:  I GOT INTO X-RAY SCHOOL!!!  I'm very excited and anxious at the same time.  It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I think I"ll be ok.
