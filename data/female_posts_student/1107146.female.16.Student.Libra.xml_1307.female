I just kind of throw things in drawers so she can clean around me.  I'm excited about Ren Fest.  And Josh, you might want to bring another guy along.  Liz, Abby, and I may be able to overtake you and rape you ;) Well, the opposite is what my mother thinks, so why not?  Seriously though, if you don't want to hang out with just us girls, we don't mind another guy.
