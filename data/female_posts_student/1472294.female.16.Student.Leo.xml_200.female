But unless somebody is a friend of the LJ and so- called 'pick me', THEN I can log in as one.... BUT I am still very happy and satisfied as a Blogger user. DON'T KICK ME OUT! I really, really am hoping and wishing and praying for one Super Dollfie doll. The dolls look so nice with the eyes and beautiful face.... You can even customize it through esthetics (something-like-that, spelling maybe wrong), I really want it!!!
