Like stopping at every single store on BOTH SIDES of the main strip in burleson. How crazy is that...Oh I used this new face stuff today and its really nice on my face...you should look into face stuff...Im not for sure what it was...but what can ya do. Then friday I plan to clean, and go shopping with mom if she can get off work, and then going to the movies  so if anyone wants to go see Little Black Book, friday and well I dont know what time, give me a call.  Then saturday I cant remember. Well today I woke up and went to the South School and helped Tracy with her room for about 4 hours, went to eat lunch, and watched a movie, went to get a snow cone and to drop off clothes at the second hand place. Then back to help some more, went to eat dinner and played Uno. Now Im here and kinda tired. Oh man and I almost died 3 times today...terrible...oh man and I also saw a horse thingy...LMAO...I have never seen one before...it was exciting...lol. Well I guess thats really all I have for right now, just about the same thing that happens everyday. Same stuff, but I love it. Till then, Later Days.
