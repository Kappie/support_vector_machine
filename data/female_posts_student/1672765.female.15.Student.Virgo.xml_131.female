It was such a great movie, so funny. I love seeing movies too, doesn't matter what movie, really. Afterwards we went to Dairy Queen. 	At Dairy Queen it was packed! All these kids had the same shirts on and everything, they were some kids from Fuqua. Fuqua, this private school. This is the like the epitome of all that is stereotypically private school. These were the beautiful people that will go to Duke because daddy has "connections" they will be everyone's boss, they will be the boss of the kids they beat up in high school, the kids that qualify way more to be the boss. They will grow up sheltered, most spend their entire lives at Fuqua, or at least private schools in general. And it's a nice thought to think that after they graduate then they'll finally see things, and fall on their faces flat. But no, that won't happen. They will all go off to their private colleges, and be with the exact same type of people from high school. This will be their life. I pity them. 	I could be one of them. 	I used to go to Fuqua, you know. Through fourth grade. I remember when I went their it was my worst nightmare - to go to a public school. To me, that was the most horrible, scariest thing that could ever happen to me. Then came the day I found out I actually would be switching. This was crazy, I couldn't handle it. I don't have a good memory at all, but that is one of the few memories that stick vivid in my mind - finding I was switching from a private to public school. Black kids? I would be going to school with black kids? Aren't they all like dirty, bad people? And gangs...and fighting...isn't that all at public schools? What was going to become of me? 	It's one thing that really makes up what I am - looking back, making that transition. Now I would rather slit my throat and let the blood drip into a cup then drink it back down then go back to a private school, namely Fuqua. I'd rather gouge out my own eyes than to never have left Fuqua. I realize this is weird to say because I would never know any different, but I'm just saying I'm so, so glad I left.  	And seeing all these kids made me wonder how I would have turned out. I couldn't be the same, could I? I think this is the eternal question that everyone asks...especially with the cloning issue. Are our personalities predestined? I mean, naturally environment plays a big role, because one kid who grew up in the White House is obviously going to be different then if they grew up in an alley. Right? Or, wouldn't they still at least have some similarities? At a first thought you immediatly think, "Of course they'd be different!" But I think hard about it and I'm not sure at all. If the White House kid is self-righteous and self-absorbed and uncaring about other people, you'd think someone living on the streets wouldn't be like that. But couldn't they? They may have it alot harder, and are probably way stronger, but they could still be like that, couldn't they? 	So I'm so confused, what the hell would I be like?? Would I, today be sitting here typing on my computer, listening to Interpol with my AFI poster next to me and my TryVeg.Com ad on my door?  	Then, I look ahead of me and see my photograph of me, Shelby and Amanda together. That stops me. Never met them...I would never have me them...what would have become of me? Who would I have been friends with? Because, I don't think I would fit in with any of those people at Fuqua, I think I would eventually have drawn away from them and been an outcast throughout middle and high school. But I was thinking...when I was younger that would bother me alot...wanting people to like me...and doing things just because I wanted them to like me and I thought it would make them...but eventually I broke away from that...gradually though...and now I still have an occasionally weakening but that's it. Was that because of switching schools and growing up somewhere else?? Or would I have grown up to always be like that if I stayed? I'm thinking maybe yes, because it was so sheltered.  	I remember the second day at the public school I saw this little girl in a wheelchair who was acting so strangely and I went home and just bawled. What was wrong with this poor little girl? I was so scared. I had never been exposed to anything except white, capable, rich kids. And here, kids were specially educated, they had reduced lunches.  	At Dairy Queen I recognized a couple kids. One was my best friend. My best friend. I know it was her even though she looked so different. She was my best friend of course I recognized her. I haven't seen her since 6th grade. I didn't say anything to her, though. I didn't know if I really wanted to or not, and I still don't. I'm sorry for stereotyping people, but she looked like even if I did say something to her and she did recognize me she wouldn't have even wanted to acknowledge my existance. I mean you've seen the movies - this is the girl the dorky guy wants and then in the end just when she finally falls for him he finds out he really does love the losery girl that's always loved him. I remember she always was the most popular girl in my grade, and was well known in several other grades. This girl had a "boyfriend" in 3rd grade, she made good grades, all the teachers loved her - you know, that type. I really never did figure out how she was my friend, and she really did like me, didn't she? She did, she really did. Huh. Imagine that. So maybe she wouldn't have seen me as lowly...but she could have...I would have liked to know...but maybe I don't.     Music: Leif Erikson - Interpol
