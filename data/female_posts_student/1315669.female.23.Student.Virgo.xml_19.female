All that medical terms and ambiguous microbial names eludes my puny brain which to worsen the 5-sec memory that I already have, the virus is gnawing inside... making things not any better. Too stress up lately.. maybe its like some pay back time where u enjoy too much and the sequelae is mockingly slapping u on the face.  Ha ha ha  yea.. I'm nuts. I came back home in a cabby today cos I just can't seem to drag my fat body up to the bus and sneezing all the pathogens out from my body to harm those innocent victims (then again I shld rite? Anyway, we are too overpopulated). In case, anyone kena SARS there, I might be the primary person for quarantined. Tsk.   So much work, so much stress.. from everywhere.. No wonder I'm sick. Too much bombardment of shit on me and now i'm turning into one sh**hole.   My baby is coming back later (he's prolly reading this,  must be checking routinely if I update the blog). Heh... Miss him quite  abit.. But then again, sadly I can't see him with my infected viral body. Hiakz. Miss his red red nose and perky butt.   Heee.... =P  ok lah, me got to go and die once again in tat stack of notes.. nites peeps. See ya in sandman's dreams
