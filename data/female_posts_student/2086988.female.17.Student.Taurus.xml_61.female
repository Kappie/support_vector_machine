But the worst thing was him leaving today. If only I could stay in his arms a little longer, the whole time we were waiting for the bus I was trying so hard not to cry, then once he got on I went into my car and just cried, I couldn't help it, then I basically cried all the way home, lol I know I got some looks but I didn't care. Now that I'm back home it's really hard because I can still smell his colonge on my bed and pillows, on my clothes, and in my car. I think this has got to be one of the hardest things I've ever had to do...I miss him so much, I wish we could just lay in each other's arms forever, :::sigh::: maybe one day...but until then I guess the next time we can see each other would be at Spring Break and maybe even during the summer, so those are some positive outlooks. These past 3 days have been the best ever...David, sweetie, I love you so much and I hope that one day we can just be together and we'll never have to leave one another again...  How do I get through a night without you? How do I live without you? What kind of life would this be?
