Sadly, there are enough BAD things about this morning to make up for it, so I guess it all evens out.  My locker smells like something died in it.  It is... Nasty, to use a polite term.  Very... very... very  nasty. Oh, how INTERESTING!  I just tried italics on this stupid thing for the first time and it looks funny.  It's one of those... html... things.  I have no idea what I'm talking about, and I can still smell my locker.  I am in the LIBRARY now.  I should not smell my locker.  So, either the stench has been imprinted on my brain and not until death does my brain (and, thus, the smell) die....  OR the option with the higher probability of correctness, which is that it hooked little tiny evil smell-feet into my clothing.  I, luckily, have solutions for each of those problems (excepting the rather grievous grammatical landmine).  If it's God's version of psychological warfare, I will inhale altoids and explode my sinuses and my brain.  If it's on my clothing then I will proceed to inhale the altoids AND drench myself with perfume (which wears off in three seconds anyways).  My plan is that I WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT which is really what counts.  I have to live with myself after all.  THEY all just have to sit with me for an hour a day. Hmmmm....  I'm gonna go check what I already posted about this weekend, because I can't remember very well.  TEN MINUTE BELL, OH HOW I DREAD THY COMING!
