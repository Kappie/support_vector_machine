Eh, after I come back I gotta go to school. :( BUT, I got a TI-84 Plus SILVER EDITION! I'm such a goob, I get excited over an effin' calculator. But it's a nice calculator.       AND, I got a credit card... kinda! It's sweeeeeet!! It's for my trip, but what I'm gonna do is this: I'm gonna be really stingy in England and not spend much, then come back and spend all of the money meant for my trip on clothes for school. Smart, no?
