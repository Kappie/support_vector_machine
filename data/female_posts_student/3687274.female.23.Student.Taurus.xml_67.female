I just want you to try and understand what type of person can have this kind of reaction to a specific type of situation. I don't think I overreacted. I don't think I expect too much.  Well, this is just to get something off of my chest. It's my blog.  So okay, here goes.  Dear Tracy,  I just heard from Robin about what happened last week/earlier this week. Really sorry to hear that. Just kind of wandering why I didn't hear it from you? I realize that this is probably something that wasn't really that big of a deal, but the way Robin explained it, I think it was. But who cares, right? I don't really want to talk about this...at all. I'd just like to explain why I feel this way, in my blog. If you read this and you want to comment go for it, if not, cool. It's just that I know that we've had these talks so many times and I'd rather avoid it this time as much as you would, because obviously neither of us were listening to eachother. I continue to expect things of you and you continue to not deliver. Well, I think that it would be nice if you felt the need to update me on your life. I don't think that you ever will. I remember I told you a while ago that I'd like to be apart of the good and the bad. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was something. Maybe you got it out of your system. Maybe you just didn't think to tell me. Wouldn't that last one suck? Well, I don't really know how to react to this. I'm actually hurt that I heard it almost a week later from Robin. But maybe it just wasn't important. I don't know the reason. I don't really care to. I just had a bitch.
