It says I'm in circle 7, but the day before I took it and was in the 8th circle of Hell, the Malebolge (huh huh...I said male bulge).  Damn it I wanna go back with all the other panderers  gypsies.  Anyhow, big ups to  urlLink Boz  and  urlLink Kevynn  for putting this up for me to take.   The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Seventh Level of Hell!
