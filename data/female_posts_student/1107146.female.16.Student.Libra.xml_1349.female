And I want to see the song...this should be interesting.  If you're not going to post it, at least e-mail it to me or something.    So, today was super fun.  I enjoy hospitals and waiting rooms and needles and coloring books.  (Sarcasm, for the slower ones...)  Anyway, people call me tomorrow, please.  I can already tell that I'm going to be majorly bored cause my mom will be at Habitat, and my dad at work and my sis at school/work.  So, I'm going to be calling a bunch of hair salons and making little button faces all day long!!!!  Boy howdy, I CANNOT wait!
