My complete inability to open up to even my closest friends on certain things, my constant pretending to be some variation of who I am, but never completely myself, around people because, try as I might to deny it, I really do care what others think of me, sometimes to the point that it is pathological, is all beginning to frustrate me just a bit.  Also, though, I feel a strong and compelling fear that is forcing me almost not to change.  I continue to see people at school that I would like to know or want to learn more about, yet my stubborn and unassailable refusal to DO anything about it depresses me to my very inner core.  I don't let people see myself for fear of being broken, yet I end up broken anyway, unable to operate in the world at all.    And all this after my weekend seemed so hopeful.  I guess there is still hope for the week as well.  I do have a certain resiliency of the spirit that comes out; it acts as my defense mechanism in times like this, especially at times like this when I am very stressed and very susceptible to these thoughts and feelings and depressions, and hopefully it will save me yet again.  And hopefully one day soon I will learn my lesson, learn to be more assertive, and go for things and just tell people how I really feel, regardless of the potential harmful consequences.  It's better than living a lie, and it's better than being alone.
