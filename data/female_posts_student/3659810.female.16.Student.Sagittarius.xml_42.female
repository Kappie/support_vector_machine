I went back to my blog and looked at my last post and thought.... what the fuck was I on? oh well anyway. Jonathan and Jenny came over last night for movies. we watched secret window - very good the crow - very good  Jonathan had to go home. damn parents not trusting me around guys.... or is it the other way around? but Jenny stayed. we talked for ages and i realised how much of a whiney bitch i've been over the last week... i hope it doesn't last  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
