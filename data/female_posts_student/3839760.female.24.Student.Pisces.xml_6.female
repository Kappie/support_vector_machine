Weird...Anyhow...I don't really have anything particularly interesting to say. I start this new job technically tomorrow but I am going in for training today. It's a little weird. I'll be teaching little kids how to play golf. Dude! I don't even know how to play golf!!! Holy Macro...what have I gotten myself into?! I guess I'll find out tomorrow. YIKES! I need a nap...so I'm going to sleep now. Bye.
