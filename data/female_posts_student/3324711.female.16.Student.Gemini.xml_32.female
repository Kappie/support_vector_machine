Plus  on Friday I am now Kates special guest for the show! aka I get in free. Swicked. I love free stuff.. specially when its food :)  I hate doctors, and their crazy appointments..   ---------  8:42PM   I officially love Laozi and what he did for Daoism. And Im done studying!  "Damn you You and your activites"  Well Im off to do something productive.
