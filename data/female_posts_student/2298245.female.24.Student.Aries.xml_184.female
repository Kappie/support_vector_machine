Then, upon arriving at school, she realized that she'd forgotten the charger for her computer, so she couldn't do half of the things she planned on doing in the library because her battery wouldn't last long enough.  So now, Shannon,  sans  brain, sits in the library doing her reading, which is the only thing she can do without prolonged use of the computer...Except for updating the blog, of course.  They say talking about yourself in the 3rd person is a sign of great trouble....Just think how well it served Bob Dole.
