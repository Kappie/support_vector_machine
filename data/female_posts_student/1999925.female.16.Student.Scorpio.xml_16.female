If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?  If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call  If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all   I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now  We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed?  If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head?  If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life?  If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife? (husband >.  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true  We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  And I wish that you could be the one I die with  And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with  I hope I love you all my life   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away  And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today  ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right  And though I can’t be with you tonight  And know my heart is by your side   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
