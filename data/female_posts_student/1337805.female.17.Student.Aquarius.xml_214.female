He walks out the door, and goes down the stairs to the deck below.  I look at Laura, and wait a few moments, then follow. I open the door, and follow his path down the stairs, and see him standing near the wall.  I walk to him closer, and he wraps me in his arms, and kisses me. I kiss him back, shuddering because it is cold outside. He pulls me closer. My arm is around his back, the other pressed against his chest. His arms are on the small of my back, one creeps around and slowly is tracing the outline of my jeans, the other, pulling me closer to him with each kiss.  The hand finds the edge of my shirt, and travels up my back, sending tremors through my body as the cold air hits the exposed air, and at the feel of his touch. We kiss more, as time flies by around us.  We pull away, and I run inside. He sits beside me on the couch, and puts his arm around me, pulling me closer to him. He whisperes things in my ear, kissing my neck, cheek, earlobe. We all talk and laugh, and he sneaks in a kiss or there, here and then, carefully placed.  I couldn't imagine myself with him before, and now that we're together, I can't imagine how I got a long without him. And where this sweet side of him has been hiding.   I love you.
