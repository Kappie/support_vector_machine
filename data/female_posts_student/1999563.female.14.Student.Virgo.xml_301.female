The concert was pretty good but mosh pit=bad! :)   One quote, the quote of ALL quotes.  Okay, this girl who ran the merch with me gave tricia some cookies and a picture her little sister drew of trish and tricia was like "Man...this will probably be the only valentine i get because all the boys in the band want a valentine from a barlow girl, not a brock girl."  Hahhahaha  I love her.   She hugged me and I am her little sister, so she says :) I love Tricia and Melissa to death.  I didn't get to talk to Mel as much becasue I was running the booth the whole time :/   But, they gave me a free shirt so its all goood.   Yeah. :)
