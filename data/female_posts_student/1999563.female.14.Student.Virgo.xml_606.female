Except, I have a problem. i can't think of a thing to say!!  This is quite depressing.   But, I will turn to the word of God.  And guess what. It aint good news.   James 2:2-4  Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?   This is a totally relevant problem in our churches and just about everywhere today.  It seems like we pay special attention to the people who are good looking and/or rich.  A school they are always the most popular.  They always seems to have the most friends.  if some we didn't know came to youth group and she wasn't attractive at all it seems like she would just get ignored.  But, if a beautiful person came they would probably be flocked to by a couple people as soon as she entered the room.  James 2:5- Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?  If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.  We need to reach out to EVERYONE. It doesn't matter if it would "hurt our reputation" to be seen with them. It really doesn't.  God died for EVERYONE. Everyone gets to heaven equally.   We need to love everyone.  We need to start a change in society. Reach out to the "unatractive" people. They need it way more than the rich and beautiful. They are also SO amazingly beautiful in there hearts, if only we would get to know them.
