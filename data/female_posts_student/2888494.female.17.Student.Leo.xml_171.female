(They’re definitely NOT in my closet, believe you me…)  Mom:  “Well, that explains a lot. I saw the purse in your room so I peaked inside and was confused when I saw all of your stuff inside. Where did you get that mascara? It works like a dream.”  Remind me as to why I ever felt privacy existed in this house….
