I was all ready to submit work to school, but the site is still down. It will either be up later today or tomorrow, I guess. So at the moment I'm reading the Bible and awaiting baby sitting a little while from 8:30/ish through ??.  Later today I need to go to the bank and like, Wal Mart, or the Mall or something. Oh, and yesterday mom and I watched Renaissance Man starring Danny DeVito. And last week I saw Cold Mountain, which was a  great  movie! Now I want the soundtrack.  Heehee
