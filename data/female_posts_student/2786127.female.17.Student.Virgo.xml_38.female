I usually Don't want to write about past events in my blog...i more feel like rambling nonscence usually. I bought some new pants today, but no prom dress :( I think i might want this one but its a whopping $180...I don't know if i want my greedy little self to spend that much on one freakin dress. I went dress shopping FOUR times this week. Punch me please...i hate the mall.  hmm. So you'd think that when you went in for a physical because of *depression* they'd only do things like...oh you know, check glands, draw blood and such to see if you have some sort of chemical imbalance... or something. Well my friends don't ever let them fool you like that...my doctor turned out to be a *secret* gynocologist...thats right..."So Jessica, have you ever had a pap smear?" OH MY GOD.  so. that was uncomfortable. If I ever have to put my legs into *stirrups* again when NOT placed on a horse....well....lets just say I won't. ever. again.  ONE good thing about the crazy doctor was that usually doctors scales crazy add like 10 pounds to my actual weight...and this last time mine was excitedly low. yay loseing weight! wooo.  I need to cool it with the bad self esteem. Its driving me crazy. This weekend is going to be full of homework and working on how to answer matt for prom(yeah...thats still not done)   I need summer and summer clothes and hanging out on the lake on a nice sunny day with all my friends...boating and wakeboarding a playing volleyball...those days are definatly the best I have all year...  So. Nate was supposed to come over after school today. Wonder what happened with that. Nate pisses me off...I try not to think about him anymore or I'll probably get extremly sad. I wonder why he never trys to hang out with me anymore. Can anyone say douche.  Easter is on sunday... i love easter because i love peeps, and pastel colors, and sunshine and happiness. yay!.. what i don't love about THIS easter is that my dad wants us to have dinner with this lady he's dateing. So that would be uncomfortable enough, but throw her 15 and 17 year old daughters in the mix...well...awkward. And i refuse to be there. I feel bad because i want to be there for my dad but seriously, i already hate them and i haven't even met them. Kind of weird...but i know dinner would just be awkward silence and glares and my dad saying "mmm, good dinner good dinner" for a conversation filller. Ugh. Must escape...but if i did i wouldn't be able to avoid feeling completely guilty about leaving my dad...RAWRRR...I guess i should talk to him soon about it, because otherwise i probably will just leave the house on sunday...and that would be bitch of me.  I'm going to a movie with ben tommorow. Good...bad...meh....I haven't actually *explained* to any of these guys that I'm not dateing anyone right now...I'm assuming they *know* except....i doubt matt and nate do. I feel somewhat guilty...but whatever. I'm in a whatever mood about the entire situation. I don't want to be in a "serious" relationship again for a long time...I'm sick of giving any (even an infetismal) part of my heart to any guy anymore when they all just turn out to be complete and utter jerks. SO NOW the tables turn...and I'm in control and I'm going to do whatever the hell i want with the guys in my life. Take that bitch. I'm sick of being hurt...I just can't take it anymore...  I need to go to bed. Its two am and I've been up since 6 this morning. yay...mornings...
