[cackle - geeky referance allert]  I have this little experiment that I want to conduct, and I'd love it if others out there did it too, to get a good survey.  Ok, Pick 5 or 6 large charches in or around your city. Go to confession and confess the same sin, write down what the pennance is for each church. This way all people will know where to go to get the best bang for you buck, so to speak.  would be really interesting to see the contrasts within a single church as well.  yes, It could be said that this is extreemly disrespectful of other religions, and I have to dissagree. because I in no way am insulting or demening any institution that builds so  many bad-ass buildings that would make excellent bars. as long as your respectfull, no harm no foul  And If there is a hell that I'm going to rot in, at least they'll have taquilla and AC, thank you very much.
