"Nobody puts Baby in a corner!". Hehe, classic. Anyways, I babysat last night, and then slept over at their house. It wasn't that hard. I pretty much fell asleep on the couch watching the Disney channel while the girls played. Kinda sucked, though. I did make $32. Thats cool. I'm so tired. I cannot wait for one acts to end. I am so sick of it. It will be really nice starting next week when I can focus only on Anything Goes.
