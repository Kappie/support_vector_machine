Especially because that person wrote it, i think its good when a person isn't afraid to show what they wrote. Ya but anyway, there is nothing and i mean nothing going on.....its 11:22....and im bored....kinda tired. Wrote some more poetry for the site. So i guess check it out if you wish. I'm just chillin out right now, thinking about life...whats left of it anyway. Thinking of ppls i miss, like everyone i know because everyone i know is somewhere else. *ugh* how can i be so bored?!?
