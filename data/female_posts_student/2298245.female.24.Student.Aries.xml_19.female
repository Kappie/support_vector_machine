As a side note, to anyone reading this who might be thinking about attending law school:  DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THREE WEEKS BEFORE FINALS TO TRY AND GET CAUGHT UP ON THE READING.  So now you know.  I cannot recall what the main point of this post was supposed to be.  I guess I'm just a little down because I'd really like this blog to be a place where I express my thoughts on the big important issues of the day, but with all the time that law school sucks up, I only have the time or energy to post about...well, about how much law school sucks or how much my life sucks or how much I'd rather be at the dentist than sitting here getting caught up on my Criminal Law reading.  I know that these things cannot possibly be of much interest to the great folks out there reading this...I mean, they're barely of interest to me.  Hopefully, once the semester ends, I will be able to get caught up on the world around me, and will have interesting things to say.  In the meanwhile, check out  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  (also linked to the right) for content along these lines much better than anything you could ever hope to find here, even on my best of days.  Chances are if you're reading this, though, you already know who he is, and the link is completely unecessary.  Ah, well.  Enough wasting time.  Back to work!
