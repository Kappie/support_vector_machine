I already wrote heaps in Finnish, now I'm tired of this blogging shit again but still something draws me to writing also in English. Oh maaaaaaan.  I also decided NOT to go to IRC but lookylooky, there I am.   Erm, what then... Yeah. I'm gone. Read some Finnish. If you can't, tough. Just ask me, how I'm doing and I'll tell you what you want to know.
