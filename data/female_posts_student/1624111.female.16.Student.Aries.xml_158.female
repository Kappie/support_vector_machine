"no" "you know, ill bet somewhere up in heaven theres this big pile of all the good things amanda does for emily" and there might have been a bit more to that conversation but i dont remember it.  i hardly said anything. i almost told her i didnt care if it was futile and that i only truly fail if i give up, but i didnt. silence is good too, sometimes.  it was kind of depressing though...cause here i was...all decided that i wouldnt be too sad that i couldnt see emily tonight, because i was gonna call her and talk to her on the phone for a while...and that would be good in its own way. after all, its not the action of us going somewhere to do something that i care about, its talking to her. and phones help with that. too bad she never gets online anymore. and so i was writing this note to her and being all....not mopey.... and being constructive and thinking positive and trying to do all i can to fix everything and....and...all that. but then out of nowhere micheles like "you know, its not going to help" and what?!? nononono. dont tell me that. i mean, her opinion doesnt motivate me to give up or anything, but... it kind of made me sad. though she did say the bit about God keeping track of all the things i do to try and be a good friend to emily, so maybe that balances out the negativity of the first comment... if shes going to praise my efforts that would mean she thinks its good that i keep trying at it, right? i dunno, man, i dunno...   You think God smiles on my efforts at being a good friend...however fruitless?   i dunno...just...an interesting interaction....  and i wish they werent so negative on emily... be a little understanding--im trying to be. she has her own life. she has a right to be concerned with her life...gotta deal with your life before other peoples'. stuff like that. i dunno. she doesnt mean to hurt me....and its not her that ever does...its lack of her. you know? i dunno. i dont understand what she does sometimes, and i dont always like it, but i respect her waaaaaaaaaaay too much to be mad at  her  for this unpleasantness. shes still a good kid. if she wasnt, i woudlnt care so much about seeing her. and she deserves her sleep. and her boyfriend. and maybe not her homework, but she deserves to take what accelerated honors ap crazy hard classes she wants and be as busy as she can stand if it makes her happy. so lets not hate emily because amanda misses her and never gets to see her. hate her schedule and her desire to be busy, but dont hate her.  not that anyone does...but... i dunno.   and i dont know ho much sense this makes anymore cause im really tired and im going to bed.  since she was sleeping when i called tonight, i think im gonna call tomorrow just to talk and propose the journal idea. heres hoping it is well received.
