If I want to be a vegetarian at some point than instead of going cold turkey (hahaha), I shall begin by just cutting out the red and white meat as of right....(swallowing last bites of taco) now!   James thinks I can't give up brats but I've done it before and I'll do it again.   I won't miss:                    bacon                            ribs                             anything BBQ'd roast kielbasa
