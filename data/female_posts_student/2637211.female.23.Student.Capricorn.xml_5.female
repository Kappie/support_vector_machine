And there aren't any other good cute funny guys on SNL besides him. Horatio Sands is not gonna make up for the loss of Jimmy Fallon. I'm so depressed. Honestly, the only thing that'll keep me watching is Tina Fey, and she's branching out into movies. Did you see 'Mean Girls'? Brilliant stuff. She has a career ahead of her, a very witty and clever career. Yay for smart, pretty girls with glasses!
