If they laid eggs, the woman was pregnant.  Europeans used to predict the sex of an unborn child by dropping a frog near the expectant mother. If the frog landed on its back, she'd have a girl. If it landed on its belly she'd have a boy.  -- Posted in the frog section of the  urlLink Vancouver Aquarium    I can't wait to return to school tomorrow. The past 2 days have been absolutely terrible. That's why I hate being sick. :( My fever hit 39.4 Degree celcius yesterday morning and I was petrified. Thanks guys for all the sweet sms-ses. It's because of all your thoughtful messages that make me want to recover asap. :)
