Yeah...that's the background music ;-)  I'm such a goober, but I do love the Lord of the Rings so much.  I think because it epitomizes the struggle between good and evil, among other things.  I read somewhere about elves in the story:  "They have more beauty than any other creatures on earth, but also possess the most extreme happiness and sorrow"  I can identify with that.  Perhaps not the beauty part, but certainly with the ability to feel things so deeply.  I met this one man at a coffee shop once who has been reading palms for 13 years, and he took one look at my left palm and said:  "You have the uncanny ability to experience emotions more deeply than any other human being I've ever known.  You absorb extreme amounts of energy from everything around you; you absorb energy from that coffee table over there.  This can be beneficial in some cases, as it would enable you to be deeply affected by others around you, and you can experience the most extreme sense of euphoria.  But be careful--because you are so deeply affected by everything and everyone around you, you can also experience the most profound sorrow."  Note to self.
