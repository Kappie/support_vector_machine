Beki didn't come to school so at the end it was just me and Izzy in our class... and boy did we feel insignificant! Every one was ignoring us in Spanish and it was fun! Then I had these head phones on and this really loud music came on and I screamed. Aparantly every one noticed but I wasn't too sure... Oh and I had to wear black flower trouses today *sigh/cringe* Hehe, but I'm so head strong that no body said any thing! YOU PUNY MORTALS! Any way... *cough* slightly ignoring that! Heeey but I go scary when I'm around my friends so every one's ignoring me already! Fun! At least we won't have to deal with the WSL's any more... I hope! Oh and Izzy said that her mum told her to punch Rosie! Woah! Go Izzy's mum's influence on Izzy! (If that makes any sense!) Oh and I'm oh-so slightly addicted to Final Fantasy X so I'm not blogging as much as I used to! Sorry! I'll breathe on this now, blog later bubi.
