I really dont think I have read such a powerful series in a long time. Garth Nix's Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were good but Queens Own was better. I didnt know it was possible to write a book that well. .....oh my goddess.....I love her books. I would die with joy if I had them all, although that would be pointless seeing as how I wouldnt be able to read them...*sigh*....well.....I am just going to sit here in awe...bye...  Goddess Bless.
