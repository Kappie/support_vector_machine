Freaky weatherman,  urlLink Jim Castillo , told me that we would have 3 inches on the ground for the commute to work which would start mixing with sleet and freezing rain.  Where is  urlLink Nick Gregory  when we need him, Fox 5?  All I have to say is that it better start snowin' A.S.A.P. and close my job early so that I can just go home and nap, othwise it's gonna be Jim Castillo's cross-eyed head!
