NO ITS NOT. nobody llives ina box {with the exception of hobos} and my little "bubble" is bumping into other ppls bubbles. this chick i talk to online that i met in a room where chatting happens is a little whiner and i am getting tired of it. She lives far away from me but like come on shut up. I want to tell her that it get annoying wen she tries to make me feel guiltty. I hate it so much but she is like a good friend {one of the best} and i dont know how to tell her with out her making me feel guilty i hat it i hate it i hate it.      Ne wayz i am totally getting into this blog thing and i am looking forward to trying to get some comments on my shitty life. How messed up in the head i am.     my biggest issue is that i am 14 an i have NEVER had a boyfriend and i dont know y i mean i am not wierd or a sped or ne thing and im not rude {i think} and im not a lesbian. I am not completly ugly and im not extremly fat but ill let you know i am not hot and i am not thin at all and i never have been. I even have friends {had friends old friends not the ones i have know} theat r ruder uglier and fatter than i and they have had millions of bfs.    Enough of that lets move on to "happier places" the world is a beautiful plase. I am an athiest and i do not want to affend ne of you but i think of it a santa clause. I have too much time on my hads in the summer. I am going to go to my school this summer and run sprints and i am going to become  hot.       Whta do you call it wen a smurf relieves itself on ur lawn........................................................................................................................blue grass.         Whoose line is it ne way at its best. I looooove mad Tv stuart ROCKS.           Girls spend too much time thinking about guys........or maybe i just spend to much time thinking about guys.           I love dejavoo do you i mena it is just like a mini premaniscian
