It was to get me to, unbeknown to you.  What was tearing me up, you had no clue.   You walked in the town late that night,  The streets lit dimly with little light.  The road was narrow dark and bleak,  Your pace quickened as the wind begun to sneak.  Houses lined the street ever so tall,  Staring down on you, waiting your fall.   You turned to look at where my house should be,  Instead an ugly grey structure to which you hold the key.  Seemed to be in place of my loving home,  “Watch out” it almost seems to moan.  You open the gate and the door to follow,  You shouted my name into the hollow.  No response was heard, not even a creak  You thought, “Why is it she wont speak”   20foot tall the walls grew  Holding their breath as they new  What was after you was going to take me  No chance at all for you to flee.  You tried flicking the switch but the light stayed dull  No sounds, no noise, not even a lull.  You started to wonder what was going on  Where was I, what happened, what went wrong  Before you even had time to think  It came and took you in a wink   You never fussed, you just stayed calm  When this dark creature pulled out her gun.  With one quick shot your lights went out  As dark as the rest in the house.  I looked into you eyes, what have I done  My insanity had over come  I had just sent the one I love  Into the heavens of above.   My jealousy of you all these years  Had finally come out with many tears.  You trusted, listened and guided me,  Im sorry I couldn’t help it, I went crazy.  It’s just not fair, for me to be here  I took the life of the one I held so dear.  I cant live with myself its just too tough  Load the gun, pull the trigger, I’ve had enough.   This one was written for school haha.....pretty funny lol...
