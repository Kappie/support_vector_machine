Over the past few years, I've discovered that I have this grand talent and tolerance for putting myself into crappy situations.  I do this for two reasons: 1. I figure I don't deserve any better than crap, and/or 2. I think I can redeem the situation from the crap it's housed in.  And, as I've been living out this weekend, neither of those scenarios are true.  I've stuck it out in relationships, jobs, classes, etc that no person should have to put up with.  Often, I'd realize I was in way over my head, but I'd be too prideful or scared to  get the hell out.   So this weekend, in various arenas, I left some folks high and dry.  I pulled myself (quite belatedly) out of promises I never should have made in the first place.  And I'm endeavoring to be a bit more discerning before I jump into things.  The problem with being a "Yes Woman" is that you lose all sense of perception.  I have a habit of saying "Yes!" to the first thing that comes along, because I'm afraid of people not liking me or being afraid this is the best shot I'll get.  So as some of those dratted self-help tomes I devour say, "Don't let 'good' get in the way of 'best'."  I'm truly,  truly  sorry for the folks I've screwed over.  Even when I saw the situations going south, I didn't take the more noble and mature path and get OUT!  No - I lingered, and hemmed and hawed to myself about leaving, and ended up faltering in place, and eventually failing and causing more damage than if I hadn't gotten involved in the first blasted place.  So I must remember to tell myself - "It's better to feel like I'm screwing people over early, than to truly screw them over later."  I can't afford to spend my life building it around what other people expect of me.  Or, even better, building my life around what I  perceive  people expect of me.  So, this marks the beginning of my end of desperate living.  I have choices, I should act like it.
