Whatever. I tend to exaggerate things. Or just completely make them up. Either way.  I just ate a salad. A  salad , of all things. But it's a nice experience, strangely, sitting around in your dark house in the middle of the night, eating salad. Try it sometime.  Today was pretty good. High levels of insanity, mosquito bites, apologies to pieces of furniture, and a well-planned lie here and there. Ah, summer, when it doesn't really matter whether it's the weekend or not. Summer, when the days go by slowly and you  like  it. Ah, summer. Summer, summer, summer.  I think I must be very tired right now, though I don't feel it. My sleep schedule has been altered greatly from a few very late nights and even later mornings, so now I'm all messed up. My mind seems tired, though. Then again, I think my mind's perpetually tired. I should try to go to bed now.   Speaking of sleep schedules, I want to be nocturnal. I really do. You know, just for a week or so, as an experiment. It seems like it would be very interesting. I'm certain it would work out just fine: I would eat breakfast when my family eats dinner, I'd fix myself lunch around midnight, and I'd eat dinner when my family eats breakfast. I'd just have to force myself to stay up for a long time to make the transition. Sure, I'd hardly be able to  do  anything, but I could live like that just fine if it was only a week. All in all, it sounds like a great idea to me. But I asked my dad, and he said no. He didn't even consider it! Yeah, so it's not exactly surprising for a father not to allow his daughter to  turn nocturnal ... Oh, leave me alone.  Yes. I am tired. Definitely.  Current... Song in my head: Oh, that crazy techno thing that VW's sister listened to in ninth grade, the one with the "lalalala"s...yeah, bad song Taste in my mouth: Italian dressing and gingerale Most annoying compulsive habit: Checking blogs Attitude toward life: Confused, though accepting of the fact that life confuses me and will always confuse me Mood: Relaxed and content, though not particularly happy
