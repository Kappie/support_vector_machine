Cuz if I finally am in a good mood, and then I see someone down, ill automatically be taken down too. grrrr. It's also funny that 99% of the time that the person is down, it is completely un-related to me, but it brings me down anyways... hmm. I think that people who are in shitty moods, shouldn't be allowed to talk to other people.  Well as you can see im not in the best mood right now, and I have no reason for it. Randomly ill get my feelings hurt, or wtv for no reason.  Maybe I should just go to bed. yah I think ill do that... maybe just slleeeeppp. I want to cry. I had the best day, I have awsome friends, I have an awsome life, yesterday was my 17th bday and it was fun. So really I have no reason for this. so goodbye..... maybe ill listen to happy music. Music effects my mmooood toooo. :(   ps... emily U. hahaha
