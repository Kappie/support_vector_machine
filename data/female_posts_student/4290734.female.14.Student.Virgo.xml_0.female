My dad's shirt blew off when we were going fast so i reached and failed, then katie, then tom (my brother) and then my dad and my dad fell in the water and he was right by the prop and my brother matt (who was driving) was just standing there watching. I was like matt turn off the moter!!!! and then my dad lost his glasses and his cell and checks got all wet. But he saved the shirt! haha. And then after dinner at some place along the canal my brother matt was way late to pick up erin from her work and then we rushed back to the dock and we broke the trim on the moter. Sooo we couldn't get the boat out. And Tom was trying to pull the boat in and he fell in... his cell phone also got wet. But then some guy who just happened to have the exact same moter launched his boat and helped us out. Which is pretty amazing cuz my dads moter is really rare. So yes, my life is just oh so exciting.  and tom is a slut (not my brother).   im going to hang out with katie... later!
