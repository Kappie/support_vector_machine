I hope you don’t mind terribly, but I wanted ask for your prayers for my mother. My mom has lived with major problems with her knees since childhood. Recently, there’s been a very frightening bout where there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what was causing her current pain. Possibilities from  urlLink meningitis  to  urlLink MS  to  urlLink Lou Gehrig’s disease  were discussed, but none of the doctors really seemed to know what was wrong or how to fix it. I got an e-mail from my dad yesterday saying my mom went to go see a specialist. Praise God that it looks like it’s not anything likely to be terminal! We would appreciate, though, any prayers directed her way... their way, actually. Neither my mom or dad are Christians and... they need Him desperately. (Please don’t take that as a disparaging statement! They’re both hurting and He could help them so much!) So what I’m asking for is for God to reveal Himself to the two of them by healing my mom... and that He would do it in such a way that it couldn’t be credited to anyone or anything else. “Where two or three are gathered together in My name...” That’s the Scripture that keeps running through my head. Mom's name is Kathy and Dad's is Bill. Thank you for your patience and God bless you.
