"He was such a great person...Mr. Blue never hurt anyone! Who would do such a thing?" wonders Mr. Blue's next door neighbor Al Cohol(far right)    "Its chilling...makes you fear for your life" said Bud Weiser, local sherriff in these parts. With the 18th Annual Crunk Fest coming to Ale-en Town in less than a month, police officials are now taking precautions to make sure this doesnt happen again.        "We are starting a furious manhunt to try and capture the cold-hearted person that is responsible for this crime against humanity" said Deputy Anne Heiser. "They wont get away"        Police say if you have any information to please call 1-888-555-3333.
