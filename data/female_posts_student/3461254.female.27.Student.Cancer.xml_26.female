Although I'm no longer on the path of librarian enlightenment, sometimes something interesting occasionally shows up.  Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which American City Are You?"     New York  You're competitive, you like to take it straight to the fight.  You gotta have it all or die trying.  Also, Friday night/Saturday morning's showing of Lawrence of Arabia was grand.  I can't believe it!  I'm technically seeing a nice guy with manners!!!  He was also the only non-relative to wish me a happy birthday!  I've invited M. to watch the Detroit Fireworks with me on Wednesday, but I just emailed him this morning and since it's a Monday he's probably busy.
