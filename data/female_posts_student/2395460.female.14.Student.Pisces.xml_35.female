Best Buy conducted the survey, by the way, but I'm sure they made the non-electronics choices sound just as appealing as the gadgets available at BestBuyBestBuyBestBuy.  Some suggestions for last-minute shopping:    Buy Dad a Hummer. I mean GM's HUMMERÂ®. I'm a little short on the 50 grand for the H2, but I'm going to splurge on the $29.95   urlLink Hummer Shake Flashlight . 30 seconds of shaking will power up the LED for five minutes. Add  urlLink Outkast's Speakerboxxx  and he'll have the perfect soundtrack while he shakes. Let him go crazy because the Shake Light is shockproof and rubber-coated for protection.       urlLink The Personal Warm+Cool System Wearable Peltier Effect Climate Control  will help your dad keep cool while he mows the lawn. He'll also up his street cred in the neighborhood by looking like an electronic collared felon.      Shower your father with negative ions with the  urlLink Feel-Good Desktop Fan and Negative Ionizer . Negative ions are actually a good thing, and make the stale inside air feel more like the outdoors. Outdoors, in my case, brings a blast of fiery-hot swampiness, but negative ions should help refresh a stuffy office.     The  urlLink Nikon LaserCaddy  has a laser that calculates exact distances between tees and holes and is almost as accurate as the one implanted in the  urlLink brain of a baby boy in 1975 . It won't help anyone's swing, but is sure to look impressive to gadget-mad golf fanatics.     If you're a very very good (and rich) daughter, you can get your dad the ultimate television, the  urlLink RCA Scenium DLP Micro-Display HDTV . 61 inches of picture so clear and so true to life, he'll see Britney's pimples before she does. And his  urlLink anamorphic widescreen  DVDs will look incredible.
