We aren't really even friends. (remember...i don't have real friends..)  On saturday we went to rehersal. It was awful.  I was so tired from the night before I couldn't do anything.  Then voice.  Thank god for voice.  for some reason I "stopped singing like Britney Spears and started to sound like an angel" It was kind of nice. But considering I was sick from a reaction frmo my shot and I had a really bad headache...I was in bad mood. Suddenly I started to feel really sick and my face got really red.  Thats when my mask disapeired. I could no longer hide behind my canvas smile.  My teacher was like, "Are you okay? Are you having abad week? Trouble with friends?"  right on the dot.  How do people figure out my life like that? Ha.  I will update more later.
