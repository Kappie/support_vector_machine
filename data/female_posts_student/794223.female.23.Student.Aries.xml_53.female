I had no idea that MD Anderson was the #1 cancer treatment center in America, but I'm very glad that Brandi will be having her treatments there.  She is most definitely in good hands.  I'm praying for a miracle, like a completely different diagnosis.  Not likely, but who knows.  I bought my plane ticket today to visit Mildred in Boston over her spring break, and I'm very excited about it.  I hope that Brandi will be doing OK by then.  She is in good spirits now, and feels fine; but I know that will all change when she begins her radiation and chemo.  I'm just going to try to spend as much time as I can down there with her.  In the meantime, UT's grad application is due Thursday, and Tulane's is due February 1st.  I still need to tweak my proposal statement, which I'm planning on doing tomorrow.  I also need to drop by campus to a) turn in a library book, and b) hand in my check for the Student ILASSA conference in February.  Hopefully I can see Sarah sometime tomorrow also, because she's leaving for Brazil on Thursday and won't be back until June or July.
