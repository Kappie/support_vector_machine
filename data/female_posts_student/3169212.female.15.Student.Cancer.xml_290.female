I really haven't been around that much violence, but I've been shot in the leg once and zatted, let's see, at least twice, probably more.        Vinnet: My host thinks she's been though so much. I have been shot a couple times by staff weapons, once by a weapon of the Tau'ri,     and countless times by zatn'katel.          Sarah: Well, technically, it was her hosts getting shot, not she. *senses Vinnet's temper rising* But, you know, symbiotes feel every bit of the pain hosts perceive. *Vinnet seems satisfied*
