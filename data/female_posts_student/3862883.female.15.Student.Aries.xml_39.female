It seems to be that ever since the fat mans son died he never cried or felt sorry for himself. And when his son dies he looked at it as the son died happy and for the country. Although the fat man never looked or though of it realistically, it was all just a big front so he didn’t have to show his emotions. And deep inside he is very sad and when the women asked him if his son was really dead he then realized it was true. The fat man all those years kept all his emotions in for so long. And in that very moment he realizes his son is really dead and all the memories of his son go through his head. That is when he has his breakdown. It is a emotional topic and is going to affect him mentally and physically, although it has already happened, he just hasn’t shown it.
