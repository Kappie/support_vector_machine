First I was dating this *really* ugly guy, and it was freaking weird as hell. Like...it made no sense why I was dating him, I think it was out of pity, because I wasn't really hanging out with his friends, because they were all ugly, and I was being all pimpish and such, and yet I was dating this dirty dirty guy. And he didn't have a car, so I guess I was supposed to take him home, and we were both walking out to my car, with distance between us, and this guy was parked next to my car. So he opens the door and I lean in and kiss him, with my "boyfriend" standing right there, looking destroyed. Bahahahahahaha......well shit, it didn't make me feel bad. I just kinda looked at him like it was time for him to run and that was that. Then me and someone else were like going back in time to all these fucked up events, all of which my life was in immediate danger. And I guess it was supposed to give me some understanding...but after a long long journey I suppose...I was angry. I was pissed off. Something about the past made me realize that...everything was shit. But it didn't make sense because I don't know what pissed me off. And I got back and all these people were happy to see me and I was like "Yeah...YOU FUCKING SEE ME!" And I ran off all pissed off, full of rage and such.  Stupid ass dream.  So lots of crazy stuff has happened in the course of the past week.  Oh, and I have this big problem with zoning out. Like, dangerous problem. Like big portions of events just disappear. I mean, we're talking running red lights and crazy shit. Not remembering what I'd been doing for 3 or 4 minutes prior to the current.  You know what's good? When you wake up from a night of drinking, not really hungover...but really really freaking thirsty. And you go and you drink like 70 billion gallons of soda. God that's so good.  Haha. Okay okay, I'm sorry...I quit.  Until next time, crazies.
