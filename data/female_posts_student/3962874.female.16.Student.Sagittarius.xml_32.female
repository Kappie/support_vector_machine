She must have taken an early ferry over because I didn't sleep in too late this time. Daniel wants to go to his house sometime today but that takes a couple of hours so we probably wont do that until later. Sarah wants to hang out and so we'lll probably do that soon. Other than that, I have no idea what I'm doing today. I was just getting ready to take my mom to pick up her car that is finished being worked on at my dad's shop but then she went and decided that she didn't need a ride because she is just going to take another vehicle in for an oil change. And now I am stuck here with nothing to do. Daniel just finished mowing the back lawn for my mom and then he took a shower. We might go shopping today but that probably wont happen unless I go with my mom because Daniel wants to go tomarrow. Maybe I'll go both days. Exciting isn't it? Oh yeah, I'm going to get my hair cut soon because it is getting really long. Daniel is mad because he loves long hair. It bothers me so I never wear it down... I'm cutting it to shoulder length. Fun.
