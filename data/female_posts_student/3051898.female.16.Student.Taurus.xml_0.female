And then I came online, but nobody is online to say bye to. I did cry in bed last night, but I'm feeling okay now. Not super happy again I'm afraid, but I'm alright. Wow, this really will be my last post before I go on holiday.... I'm going to see if I can ask Chris not to be online when his mom goes out at night so that I can call him... maybe I'll be able to finally tell him that saying he loves me and then saying he doesn't is actually really upsetting for me. And maybe he can cheer me up because I'll ask him if he's been thinking about me (which I reckon he will :) ) I bet my parents are glad that I'm awake.... they were going to wake me up at 6:30, but for reasons not even I understand I woke up completely on my own not long after 5am.... Odd. I'm tired but I'm not going to get back to sleep... I guess I'll probably just have an early night tonight.  Nobody's going to read this for a while except maybe Lauren, so Lauren I'm warning you now there's loads of repetitive crap written on some days!! I hope you enjoy finding out how things between me and Chris are seeming different.... we act more like a real couple, even online last night we were asking each other if we'd miss each other and saying how we wish we were together and doing the /skiss thingie on msn and wishing they were real kisses. Actually thinking about this is cheering me up more and more... Also the fact that when we're alone we usually kiss and hug and stuff (in fact we've kissed a little bit with Louise in the room..... but I usually try to resist the temptation when she's around). I guess just because he doesn't love me it doesn't stop that things are great between us and that I reckon he's on his way to loving me (or possibly does but doesn't realise as he doesn't know what love is). Ok, now I know I'm going to be okay, I've reassured myself.  When I come back off holiday I might try to put some holiday photos on here.  Bye for 2 weeks! (unless I find a computer in Spain... *has hope*) ~Hannie xxx  P.S. A message for Lauren: Lauren my parents still don't like the idea of Shell Island... so I don't think I'm coming. I'm really going to miss you over these holidays.... When we're all together we'll have to see loads of each other to make up for it!!! And I won't moan at you too much for wearing revealing clothes! lol. Buy some credit so you can text me, as I will text you. I'm already missing you, I hope you miss me! Bye for now, luv Hannah. xxxxxx
