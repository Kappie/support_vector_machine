Heard 'bout sumthin' like that hap'nin' Saturday, but I dun even know if I can make it. I'm also busy alluva sudden, and this fuckin' ill's kinda caught up with me.  I went to the doc's to see what the fuck's wrong with me. Turns out I've got a throat infection of some sort, and it's not viral so he gave me some antibio's. 5 day treatment of Zithromax® (gotta have that "®" there) and that shit has some pleasant side-effects - I would've rather stuck with the infection. Reason I felt so incredibly weak and nauseous is b/c the thing affected my digestive system first, must've been introduced there first some how, and probably interfered with my absorption of nutrients.   Heh, I saw that commercial again for those "Brush Ups" things. You know, the very bumpy things that people slip over their fingers and can brush their teeth anywhere! Sooo gonna get discontinued: those things look like french ticklers! You know some sick individual(s) is/are already out there up to no good with those.  Oh yeah, I got a cut card...for the last day of school. Appareantly I never went to get my diploma or my report card, both of which are actually right next to me, and, according to the cut card, my continued absence could put my school success in peril...  Well, I'm the Zenman, and...wow...that's some impressive stupidity...  "Did you say the F-word?" "No, that's not my kind of thing" "Did you curse at him" "Maybe" (Paraphrased)
