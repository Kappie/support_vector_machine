I have to be at church at 5:15 a.m Do you realize how early I have to get up! 4:30 a.m cuz it takes like half an hour to get to church. BAH! I better get to sleep on the way there. I'm riding with Courtney,Karen, Ashlynne and Ashlynne's mom is driving us. I'm so excited! Dah! Tomorrow I have a flags meeting. Doo dah, I'm bored. Okay....well I'm going to stop typing and go away until something exciting happens. Oh and the way exciting should be pronounced in that sentence is like "exiting" yeah....
