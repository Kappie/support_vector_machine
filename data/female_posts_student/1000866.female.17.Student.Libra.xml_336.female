I went shopping, and I bought quite a few new tops, and a new pair of jeans. They're so comfy. I love you gap jeans. I'm not a fan of gap usually, but I LOVE their jeans. I could just marry them. Err...right, ok, moving on.  I'm in such a silly goofy mood right now. I don't know why, but I am! It's great though. Tonight, when I was peeling potatos for dinner, I had a potato family, and I made them talk with each other and stuff. Seriously, it was amazing. So much fun. I made a seemingly boring blah job fun. How old am I turning in October again? I know it can't possibly be 17. 16 year olds don't make potato families. It was so fun though. Why am I scolding myself then defending myself? Catie, you're so weird.   Hm hm hm, what else? Really, not a whole lot has been going on. Oh, I went to see Freaky Friday with Kathryn. Lots of fun. I wasn't expecting much out of a 40th remake, but...it was good....surprisingly good. It was fun just me and Kathryn hanging out and stuff. We haven't done a lot of, "just us," stuff, so it was nice to be able to talk and stuff.   I wish I had the channel, "the N." I could be watching Degrassi right now. I sort of got hooked to that show last summer when I was at my grandma's, and now I can't see it anymore. Stinky cow dung.  So, according to Lauren, I now have a fellow, "bus slut buddy." *Sigh*  I'll get her someday, I really will. I'LL GET YOU TJ!!! Well, that was nice to get out. I suppose now I'm off to the land of lolli pops and...  Something just ocurred to me. I am EXTREMELY weird.  Diane got me hooked on this game, "Snood." Now it's hard to stop playing. Ahhh. Well, I suppose Diane didn't really get me hooked, I got myself hooked. Buutt, (hehe, butt) I only played it because she said it was fun. Haha. the blame game. Gotta love it.   Along with being weird, I'm quite random.  OK, A. Why is this song playing? And B. Small children listen to this stuff. Such...dirty lyrics.  I don't even remember dl'ing this song. I don't listen to this kind of music, but here we have it...  "Don't be so quick to walk away. Dance with me. I wanna rock your body..."   Etc., etc., etc.   Don't these people realize there are small impressionable young minds at stake? Mine being one of them. OK, so I've already been corrupted, but there are so many potentially polite young people out there. La la la, I really have nothing else to say, but I sort of feel like typing in here.  Wow, band camp is soon. I should probably make a list of stuff I need. Registration is soon too. Eeek. I'm scared. I don't want my picture taken. I think I'll just wear a paper bag over my head. Really. I am NOT a photogenic person at all.   I need to stop typing now I think. I really doooo.......Oh, I dooo, cherrish youuu....why did that song come to my mind?? What is this, boy band night?? Really, what's wrong with me? OK, OK, seriouslu.....I'll go now.....  After I write the first line of my up and coming novel. I'll write a novel someday...really....  Ok, here goes....  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Is that not the best line ever? It sounds somewhat familiar, but maybe I'm just so overcome with my own satisfaction at my brilliance...  Fine, fine, fine. So Charles Dickens wrote it. Come on. No one's ever really heard of Charles Dickens anyway, and really, who's actually read Tale of Two Cities? Hem, ok...I'll be shutting up..... right .......about..........now.
