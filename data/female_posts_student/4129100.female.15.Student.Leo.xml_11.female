Calm and serene, not much going on in my mind.    The song I have playing right now is "Center of the World" by Bright Eyes. Connor O'burst's voice is so full of pain and just raw emotion, it grabs hold of your lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The song is slow and the lyrics are poetic, it's perfect for how I am feeling.   I'm not talking to anybody right now. I am waiting for Remington to get home from work. It's hard to describe Rem with words, but I shall try.   Rem: His beauty is not only in his apperance. He is such a great person to everyone and he can make you feel things so much clearer, much more pure. He is smarter then I, but he doesn't make me feel stupid. He understands that I have less life expirience and he helps me to learn things about myself and about life. He seems to think he is flawed, but in reality, who isnt? I wouldn't have him any other way then how he is now. Even if he were to change, to grow, I know that I would grow with him... or perhaps, without him.    I would try to describe myself, but I am not sure how. I am still not comfortable with who I am, which is understandable because I still have phases and such to go through, being only 15 and all. Well, barely 15, in 6 days I will be 15.      The book I am currently reading is "Welcome to the Monkey House", which is a series of short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut over the span of his lifetime. I am not sure if Vonnegut is yet deceased but I will assume he is. My favourite story as of yet would have to be "Harrison Bergeron". There's really no way to explain it, it's incredible. I suggest you attempt to find it and give it a read. The story I am on now is called "All the King's Horse's", and it's about kidnapped American soldiers and the family of the Colonel. The Colonel has to play chess for their lives with a small Asian crime lord of sorts. It's quite interesting.       I do believe that is all I have to speak about currently.  Good day.       .:-Sam-:.
