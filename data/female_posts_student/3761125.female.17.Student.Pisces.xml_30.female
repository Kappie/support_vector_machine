Yesterday, went to Kelsey's for dinner.  The day before, I saw The Village.  That movie has such crazy reviews; the people I know who've seen it either love it or hate it really.  I love it.  I really do.  The overall message of the whole thing is beautiful.  And the character, Ivy, was wonderful.  She'd be the kind of person I'd want as a good friend in my life.  She was blind but the way she acted it was like she was a blind person who could see... but could see the world just in a different way than the rest of us.  Overall, there were some incredibly lame parts where I couldn't contain my laughter and really, at those points, I was thinking that the movie sucked.  Then the end comes and everything turned around and what I thought was lame actually wasn't lame at all.  That's all I can say really.  I don't want to ruin it for any of those who actually read this.     I'm going to edit this and write more when I get home.  Later.
