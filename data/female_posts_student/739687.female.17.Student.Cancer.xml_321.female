But alas, I'm in an era where people do nothing but evaluate and speak simply for the sake of running their mouths.  I'm guilty of it. Who isn't? Everyone talks to talk. 95% of the time I'm talking I have absolutely nothing of importance to say. 95% of this entire blog, over the past 2 years...is complete bullshit and nonsense.  But then isn't it the perfect expression of life? Nonsense. If my life was exciting every day, then it would be filled with so much interesting works. But no one's life is that interesting. I mean, hell, my life is way more interesting than I go in to detail about in here. But even then...it's still boring.  If I wrote about all the crazy things I do...all the good things and the bad things...not only would you think I was a total nut, you'd probably think I told too much.  I do talk alot, but there are still things I leave to the imagination.  So my title is suitable. All I do in here is think. Think and think and blah blah blah about pointless shit. But no one in history has every been acclaimed for writing about actual substancial things. That's my opinion at least. Everything is always so metaphorical...that way people can interpret it in a thousand different ways, everyone can relate, people can argue and debate....that's the writing that makes history. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Take the bible: by far the most popular book in the history of the world. So why? Because it's so abstract, nothing's in clear print, everyone can interpret it differently. Dozens to, hell, hundreds or religions have spurred off of one book, simply by people's interpretation of it. The bible was literature of pure genius. I mean people will never stop debating over that book...and it's controversies from interpretation to inerpretation. To write a book that inspires the world for hundreds and thousands of years would be impossible if you wrote it straight forward. Because times change, and views and people change. The bible was written in such a way that it adapts and appeals to so many people, because it's sketchy, elusive, and anything but straight forward. Definately, the most ingenious piece of literature in history.  I'm not debating over fiction, nonfiction, who wrote it, blah blah...I'm simply pointing out that it's genious. Pure genious.  I'm the type of person who sees all sides. I could take stand on either side of the fence. Not just in religion. In life.  I have this way of seeing alot of different aspects.  I'm not a die-hard anything.  I don't think that really makes me a leader; I think it makes me more of a....  You see what I mean? THIS PENSIVE WASTE OF MY LIFE! I could be finishing homework.  Ahh, see ya crazies.
