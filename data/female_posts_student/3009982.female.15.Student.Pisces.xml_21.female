Both of em aren’t exactly my thing. Yeah that’s just an excuse, you’ll say. But really leh, come to think of it. Anyways, I chose ushering because acting is a definite no-no. But I still sorta hesitated. Yeah cos I don’t like meeting new people what more welcoming em? And I believe superficiality and first impressions plays an important part in this. But its okay, Mary-Ruth will take heart and face em! *grins*   Speaking of superficiality, I’m getting kinda fed-up with a few of my friends. They’re so self-conscious it makes me sick. There should be some limit to this nonsense.  -Oh my gosh, that guy is cute I could die.  -Do I look pretty today? Eeyer, there’s this huge pimple on my forehead.  -I hate my face, I hate my body. Duh. I feel so sick and disgusted typing this out. And it does go on and on. Down there, deep inside there’s a voice encouraging me to go on, being their friend, because they need me and they do not know Christ. And I’m to help them get to know Him. Oh, if only they could see, that there is so much more beyond boyfriends and pimples and branded clothes.   Father, help them see! I feel so limited in my friendship, you could say. I have so much things to say about Jesus but they either don’t wanna listen or its just some awkward situation we got there. During one of the workshops last week, they said you gotta help em find Jesus while on their wavelength. I guess that’s my fault. Cos sometimes I’m not on their wavelength. Yeah I’m their friend and all, but I’m live a waaay sheltered life then they do. Or rather They’re not contented with the sheltered life they have now. SO they look for an exposed one, if you get one I mean. They want the things in life: popularity, guys, money, branded stuff, look cool.. those stuff la.   They say I’m too deep. I use to ‘cheem’ words. Bombastic English. Sigh. So I should start sharing the gospel in Ah Lian talk… Woohooo. *grins* ‘So ah, that fella mati lor on the wooden thing. Look like ‘T’ wan… but then inside our black black heart no more. Become white adee. Then we can get to meet Daddy.’  Urgh, yuck, no. Anyways I’m exaggerating. My friends aren’t Ah Lian extremists. I don’t think I could bear them. Yeah I’m prejudiced towards ah lians. In fact, I think I should stop calling them, whoever, ‘ah lians’ cos it is criticism. I’m criticizing them when all they want acceptance and a sense of belonging. I think. I don’t know, I don’t understand them well. I don’t try to understand em well. My fault.   Ok, everyone hear, tonight, Mary-Ruth solemnly vows never again to call anyone or any group of people ‘ah lians’. Why? Because it is wrong and hurtful to do so.   Back to my friends, I guess all I need is a lil more patience on my side. They need help. Imagine, I know Jesus and I struggle so much. Imagine my friends, how much MORE they would struggle.  Hmm, I hope none of my friends will visit this blog. I only gave a few of them my url and I doubt they check it often. I once heard someone say, don’t ever ever share your spiritual problems or matters with a non-Christian. ‘Cause it might chase them away from Christ, knowing there’s so much struggles and difficulties while walking with the Lord. I wonder if that’s true. In a sense I suppose its true but then there’s like so much more to walking with the Lord then just struggles and difficulties. There’s rejoicing, comfort, happiness, belonging, acceptance.. L O V E is what there is.   I’m reading C.S. Lewis’ Mere Christianity now. His biography said that when he finally accepted Christ as his Saviour, he was probably the most reluctant person to become a Christian. “In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God…perhaps the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.” He lost the argument, the debate. And I’m reading his debate now.  People like him got to find God because they didn’t believe in God. They got all their arguments down and argued, and lost, surrendered and gave in.   But what about those people who don’t argue? Who don’t bother? Or rather, they say they’re not bothered.   Oh, *ting, light bulb comes on* I know. God works through brokenness. So it would take their brokenness to find out they really need God in order to get through their brokenness.  Interesting, huh? That’s what makes Theology just lovely. God suddenly just comes down and surprises you ever so unexpectedly. And it’s nice to know that you know a little bit more about God today. =)  I feel drained for this post. Might write another one later. While I still have the holidays to give me the allowance to do so.   Goodnight,  Mary-Ruth
