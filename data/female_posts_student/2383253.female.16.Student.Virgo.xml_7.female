Definetely bad that we have to be caged up in classrooms while the weather's like this.  I'm scared about this summer...with all the crap that has to get done I don't even know if there's going to be free time :( Miracosta for Government and Econ...Portugal festival for 2 weeks...Greece...college visits? I don't know. I want to have a summer like the ones in elementary school when summer would actually seem too long. Time just goes so much faster now, doesn't it? The years are flying by. I keep having to stop and remind myself that I need to have a good time and not stress so much that I ruin each year, each day, each minute...can't do them over again, can I? This post is making me feel older than I should feel :) Anyway. I promise myself that I will do homework faster from now on and sleep early every night. I'd forgotten how good a full night's rest felt...perhaps a lingering side effect of Chem? But I can really see how freshman year I could get away with doing my Carrillo homework and French workbook crap right before class and not stressing out about it. The only times when I freak out in school are a result of not letting my brain rest enough. Hey, it's a muscle too. Haha. Well, as of right now, I have to study/read/take notes on three chapters of Bio (one of which I do not understand in the least), do a lab, and organize some PALs stuff.  It's gonna be another long night. (Which means more late-night frantic panic-stricken convos with Leela...and her calling me at 12:30 to ask if it's too late to call my house :D)  Good times, good times.      I love you guys. Bonsoir.
