I think my brains gone all weird because im shoo bored.So whatever i write next will probably make no sense at all and bla bla bla......     Wouldnt it be really cool if you lived in like a fairytale type land place?And you where a princess...and there were dragons?And everything in the land of make believe was perfect and everything you wanted you got?     Also wouldnt it be really freaky if your dreams and nightmares came to life....how scary would that be...expesh if you dream about a giant chasing you because you have his medal...and you run away from him...and he finds you and he starts crying....and then you leave the island on a raft and drift off into the sunset with the giant crying and waving goodbye?      *Shivers*      I'd like to know why i said that.strange really.Well i got a kinda of idea.Hmmmmm.        Well im going to leave you with that weird-ness of a blogg.     I hope my mind gets better soon.          Goodbyb!
