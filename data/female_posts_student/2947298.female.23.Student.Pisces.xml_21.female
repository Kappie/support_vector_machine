I do all organic now, started my own garden, and no I still bath rock out and do anti hippie things, but I am being better to my body and environment cuz I plan on being here for a while.  Now my pessimistic blurb, “I went looking for love, and it let me down. I’m in college and I can’t find money...” I just remember a comment someone once said, and it was ironic because it was someone who I spotted countless times and was broke all the time. They said all woman are whores and only want money, when from my perspective this guy was out for money... but it just pissed me off to be lumped in to some imaginary catagory this obvious insecure male made up. So I’m talknig to my friend and my obvious pessimist view on relationships comes out AGAIN. That whole people fake themselves into being happy, fleeting, hopless and unequal.  See last blog...  And now I am at work sitting here waiting for the computers to upgrade sometime this century...  I have a story to tell, I’ll add to this later but for now I’M GONE
