(In the words of Lynne)  And its bad on charlotte for trying so hard but not realising that she's getting the wrong kind of friends the wrong way. Oh dearie me. (Uh oh I just sounded like my grandma) I don't actually have any major probs right now. Thats admazing too. Ok I've given up trying to type and restrain russell's wild instinct, so i'll just let him roam free throught mum's room. *Sings* Born freeee... Free as the wind blows...Free as the grass grows.... (shutup izzy) Sorry.
