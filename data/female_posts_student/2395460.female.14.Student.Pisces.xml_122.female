It certainly didn't take away from the game at all. In the Four Swords Adventures, the graphics - although playable one both GameCube and GameBoy Advanced - were obviously meant for the GameBoy. Still, many people would agree that the game is one of the better Zelda games, although to play multi-player you need to have as many GameBoy Advanced and GameCube GameBoy Advanced cables as players.  In 2005, Zelda will go back to it's original style of graphics with The Legend of Zelda (working title) for GameCube. From what I've seen of it, the new game's graphics are even more realistic than before (but I mean, that's comparing Nintendo64 graphics with GameCube graphics so it ought to be). As for whether the game and the story are as appealing as the graphics, we'll just have to wait and see. All I know is that it takes place before Windwaker and after Ocarina of Time and Link is adult Link.   Watch the trailer for the game at  urlLink IGN .
