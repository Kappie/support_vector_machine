I have a sore spot at the back of my tongue where the cough drops have somehow mutilated it, maybe from too much sugar, like when your lips shrivel up from having too many salty fries.  Not nervous about driving tomorrow. Just hope traffic is good and the signs are auspicious.   I need a drink. I really really do.
