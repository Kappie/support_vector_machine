Aproximatly three minutes ago I was informed by Matt( the guy who *thinks* him and I are dateing) that he was apparently asked by three girls today to Morp. He told me that, i said thats cool, and then there was silence. What did he want me to do? freak out and tell him he couldn't possibly say yes, because he HAS to come with me because im clearly in love with him.    See, I'm such a total bitch, why can't he see that im not interested in him?    Maybe everyone is right, maybe i do lead boys on...not nessacarily with the intent of hurting them, but because by having guys like me it boasts my self esteem.And trust me, its self esteem that I'm in dire need of at the moment.  That and i don't want to be the one to hurt them. That sounds like a bunch of bull shit but i find it only to be truth.  I guess I do lead guys on. MAAHH! I'm a horrible person, but i guess I'm only searching for happiness, or something.      I think part of it also is that 3 of the 4 guys "pursueing" me at the moment are x-boyfriends...and i think a reason i won't let them go so easily, because I remember what we had and such, but at the same time i can't make a choice between any of them because, again, I'm afraid of hurting people.     I'm thinking i need a new boy...yes! A new boy it is.    Stupid Nilla wafers, so damn delicious and irresistable...     speaking of nilla wafers, Chris finally broke up with Staci today. A tragedy we all saw coming, but now that its here not only is staci heartbroken but in a small way i am too, because i know exactly how she feels. I've tried to explain this to our other friends so they might possibly show her some compassion (though mostly everyone hates her at this point...for many reasons) they refuse to, makenzie even said that Staci has it coming to her.    True, she did ditch us all the time for Chris, and used us for rides to get Chris presents, and basically treated us like shit...I still feel for her, we've now been in the same boat. Meh? meh.   I need summer terribly, but i'm also afraid its going to be a bore fest. That and I'm not going to have any money because i have *yet* to find a job.    I sound like a snob in this blog.  please ignore my randoms.  Stressed! school is crazy.  I want to go swimming, i'm going to force Mark to allow me to swim in his pool. and i'm going to force him to let Genie come to. mahha!  I have to go work on my us history papes.
