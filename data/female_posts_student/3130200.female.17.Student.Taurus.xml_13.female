One person, possibly the driver, was laying on the road with his shirt torn and blood on his chest and neck.  Another person was trying to get out of the car through the sunroof, I didn't get a good look at him.  I didn't see the accident so I don't know what happened exactly.  I must have driven by mere minutes after the car overturned.  There were all ready people helping the two guys so I didn't stop.  It scared the hell out of me.  I know that accidents happen everyday but this was bad.  I mean, if either of those guys survive it will be an absolute miracle.  The whole front end of the car was destroyed.  The windshield was shattered and the hood and bumper were smashed down, almost like a boulder fell on the car.  I'll check the paper to see if there is a story on it tomorrow.  I'm dead on my feet tonight, so that's it.
