We all have one you know the one who got away who we refused to commit to etc, any way I saw (lets call him Mr fabulous) as I got of the tube laden with bags after my mum quilted me into going food shopping in marks and sparks for her. I was having a particularly bad clothes day. I woke up EVERYTHING was in the wash so I had to wear my pink trench coat (which, being me I spilt my morning cappuccino on) boring black skirt, and a t-shirt from David and goliath that I liked at the time of purchase saying “boys are stupid throw rocks at them”. So there I am practically falling of the bus with all these stupid, bloody bags, when he comes walking past with a stick thin girl who looks like she has never been tempted by Thornton’s in her life, in the Miss Selfridges jeans that should have been mine except they didn’t fit me. He smiled as he walked past and started talking to me” hello how are you, this is Helen “blah blah blah. And Miss Selfridge’s girl just stood there smirking obviously thinking god what does she look like! (Just for the record my clothes are usually great) then he was all like “great talking to you I have to go, me and Helen are getting matching bracelets” bracelets!!!! Has he gone mad! Ugh! Was so depressed I rang up my friend jer and forced him to meet me for a coffee. And we realized something sad, as it is I still really like Mr fabulous! I mean it has been ages, and I hate relationships, yet I still know his mobile number of by heart! After about 3 coffees and a pack of silk cut we decided on this plan:  1 I don’t need Mr fabulous to make me complete 2 Miss Selfridge jeans has really boring hair and mine is much nicer  3 I actually have a brain (Mr fabulous is yet to realize that being born into money does not make you clever!) 4 I don’t need a guy to validate me!
