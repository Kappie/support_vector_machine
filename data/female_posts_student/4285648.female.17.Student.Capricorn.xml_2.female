I swear, at every store i went to i was in b/t sizes or they had exactly what i wanted but didn't have my size, or had my size and fit me awesome, but was way to blasted expensive. damn jeans. I ended up getting a pair at aero, and a pair of khakis and a sweater from aero too. plus a free t shirt b/c we spent over $65. but i also got a pair of pumas that kick so much ass! they totally rock my world, i'm so pumped:D Then we ate at Applebee's, that was alrite. good food there. No birthday songs from hell this time, thank god.       Earlier today i had to paint benches that go in our backyard. that was ok except for that i had to get up at 9 after staying up till 2 and being used to sleeping till 11 or later. going back to school is gonna suck. routine sucks.       anyway, i'm going to watch without a paddle in about 15 minutes, thats right, at midnight, b/c working at a movie theater rocks and so do the perks. employee viewings the night before opening day. rock on.
