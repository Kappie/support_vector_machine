I know I never felt carefree and light without any cares or worries. Does that mean I was old? Maybe it did.  today I realized for sure that I am officially an old woman. An old, nagging woman.  I know I never used to be the nagging sort earlier on. In fact I really didn't care what the other person did or said. I am fairly easy going I believe. I know that. So then why is it that now the smallest things bother me?!  that's what I really don't understand. Whenever K refuses to take my opinion on something I tend to take it personally. Maybe he means it that way, maybe he thinks I am incapable of thinking and acting independently. But the way it comes across to me atleast is that he really does not think what I think counts for much. I know he definitely does not think that anything I do measures up to his irrational standards.  So why do I continue to try to measure up to these standards? I gave up trying to fulfill any expectations a long time ago. I knew I had to follow my own path and ignore what other people thought about me. I learnt a long time ago that it is impossible to keep everyone happy. And finally I learnt that if I kept trying to make other people happy I just made myself miserable. I think that I could be headed for misery. Oh Lord how can someone or something make me as happy as possible and as miserable as possible? Is this what love is to with?
