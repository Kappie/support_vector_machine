Today was the last day of school... which means that I'm probably never gonna see my friends that are going to Harriton ever again... *tear*.  All that we did today was get more people to sign our yearbooks, take pictures, and go to the talent show, which was pretty crappy.  They cut out all of the 6th grade acts, and I heard some were really bad, some were really good.  There were these 3 random 7th graders dancing.  Can you say future sluts of America?  That act made me even more nauseous than I already was.  The bands were all pretty good, like Tim and Sam ;)!  Lol.  But most of the solo singers were crap other than that first singer, and that random opera kid dude.  The little child prodegies of the Qian twins both played rather simple piano pieces.  The kid who cracked his knuckles was disgusting.  But the teacher band was soooooo cool.  Go Mr. Eskin!  Flute!  Lol.  I didn't know that Mr. Pitonyak played bass, but he was really good.  Does Ethan ever sit down while playing piano?!  *shudders*.  Dre and company were good.  It took me forever to realize that they were paired off in short colors, lol.  But the MCs were pretty bad.  They tried too hard and their jokes were horrible.  "Mirror, Mirror, in my hand, who's the fairest in the land?"  Haha.  After school I went to Kim's house for a pool/graduation party.  It was fun fun fun, though Alicia didn't go.  All we did was swim, eat, gossip, and watch  Love Actually , which is a very good movie.  The pool was so heated that there was steam rising from the water, lol.  They had this random guy from LM there as a lifegaurd and he knew my sister.  Eh, whatever.  It was fun, though Kim's mom was overly protective of her couch.  NO MORE DAYS LEFT OF SCHOOL!!!!!  ...la Gu
