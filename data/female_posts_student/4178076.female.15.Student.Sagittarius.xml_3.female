Well after the high speed chase and the resulting hang over... Alright so I woke up late, I watched bad TV, I went on the internet, then my dad came home and that was the end of it. Also I tried to find Jacki's phone number which I don't have. This is depressing. She is going to my school this year and I have never had an HCT person at my school so I am, excited about it. All you HCT people out there, if you have Jacki's phone number, let me know. Now today I woke up late, but not as late as yesterday, and I went online. Then I showered and got dressed and watched more TV. Then I had to go to Tai Chi with my father. Last time I went I sat on the side and read a book. This time, however, Dad's young (22), hott, male, instructor decided that I wanted to join in. So I did. After a whole bunch of exercises that were basically stretching and meditating at the same time, we played with the energy ball. Unfortunately this is not energy volleyball or energy basketball that Andrea and I play while we are supposed to be paying attention to acting instructors. This was individual energy ball and I don't think you were supposed to bounce it. Then we learned some the beginning of a tai chi form. (series of martial arts movements done slowly) This is rather like dancing with sticks. I think it offended my father's manliness when I referred to the opening foot position as ballet first. (which it was) Since I have no kinetic memory, this took a while for me to get. I hate to admit this, but it was actually very fun. Now dad wants to do it on the beach in petoski when we go camping. (So watch out, Rachel) but it really is fun. Then we came home and watcher this old movie called bladerunner. It is from back when Harrison Ford was still attractive. I have to say he aged well. Yesterday I distinctly recall wanting to talk to Ben Tomaiuolo. I don't remember why but if anyone talks to him tell him I wanted to talk to him. I probably had something important to say but I don't remember what it was. Maybe if I talk to him I will. I haven't talked to Andrew in way too long. He keeps having stuff to do. But he and Mel both got good grades so congratulations guys. I have talked to Kimmy (James) lately and I don't recommend it. He kept talking in code and he thinks there are hackers and he really might be losing it... or he lost it a long time ago. I read some of his Lobster Comics yesterday. He has some online and they are funny. Not as funny as when I get to read them because I have stolen his sketch book and hit him with it however. I was supposed to tell him that he can still use my scanner but I forgot. I talked to Japneet today. This was very surprising since I haven't talked to her since 8th grade. It was nice to talk to someone from back then. I always wonder what would have happened if I had stayed there. I really want to see everyone from my year. Just to see them, to see how they turned out. So apparently Japneet has moved to Toronto! That really seems like it would really stink! Well this has just gone on too long about nothing at all so I think I'll end it here. Right after the biggest news of all. BREE IS DEAD. This sounds cruel, I know, but it is so amazing. My house will finally smell like a house not like something died in it. Apparently she died of heart failure. I think that it had been so long since she had a bath, that she got wet and melted. So good night, but with a quick shout out to Marissa-I'm sorry it took so long for me to return you calls Andrew- Thanks for getting me through this summer Chasya and Christina-I am going to miss you guys so much this year! I can't believe you re off to college already Chana- Don't be silly. You rock, I wouldn't have spent my summer with someone who didn't. (the Rob thing not withstanding, that was a different situation) Don't get yourself down. Alright! I love everyone especially all HCT people, my Enfield people, my NJ people (lol, just garrison), and my Michigan people (Rachel and Christian)! Good Night. Oh and if you made it all the way through this post a comment so I can give you an imaginary cookie.
