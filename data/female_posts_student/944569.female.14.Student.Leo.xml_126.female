Also, I would suggest that the maker of that skin have put the whole thing in dark blue with the words as white.  i would have loved it if that's wat it were like.  If you're wondering what skin it was, it was Wishful Wonders on blogskins.com.  if you have the time, plz tell the author how i feel because i'm too shy to do it.
