I just looked at my diploma like 4 years in this hell hole for this funky little piece of paper. That's pretty messed up. My family and boyfriend were there to watch me walk across the stage. I'm just happy that it's over with. Anyways I've just been kicking it with my bay since graduation it's all good most times right now we're mad at each other I hate that feeling. I hate that he has that much power I hate that I give in just so I don't have to argue. I'm just tired I guess cause the same shit just keeps happening over and over again I just wis things that you wanted could changed by a wiggle of the nose despite me being upset I don't want comfort from anyone but him. Even though he's not my favorite person right now I still want to be in his arms and only his arms. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR .......... until tomorrow.
