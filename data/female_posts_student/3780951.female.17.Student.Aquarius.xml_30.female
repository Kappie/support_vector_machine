The original plan was to go to Mellow Mushroom, but since all the Clemson students are coming back we decided not to. Well we laughed and laughed and i was all giddy and really nervous/excitied. I was on a sugar rush, i think! Anyway, it was great fun. I love those girls!! :-)  So, im giddy like all get out. I dont know why, well maybe I do!! But, its starting to get on my nerves. I hate shaking!! HEHE!! WOW, im going crazy right now...calm down, breather...........okay.  I gotta go do push ups or something,   Later homies
