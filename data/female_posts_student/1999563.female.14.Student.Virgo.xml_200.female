Everyone lately has been thinking I am anorexic.  Maybe I am...   We went out to eat last night.  All I had was two peices of pita bread.  Everyone in my whole family had these gormet drinks.  I asked for water.  When I told the waiter I was done withmy untouched food so looked at me super funny then said in a forceful way "Are you sure...?"  Yeah, I am sure.  I can't eat.  Then I probably looked even more suspiciour when I excused myself to go to the bathroom after I ate.   Today at christmas dinner I had two olive on my plate and my cousin was like "Got enough food?! I don't want you over eating.. ;) "  And I don't know why, but it made me feel odd and akward.  I felt like everyone was trying to force food down my body.  Then she was like "Not etaing anythign till Florida, eh?"  "I eat."   I think.
