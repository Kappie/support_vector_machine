I woke up this morning and had to go out for dim sum, for A's birthday.  I was so tired from being up half the night worried about being so behind and the other half the night coughing up a lung with this horrible cough that I am having.  I am trying to do everything in my power to make it go away.  I have even turned to remedies I said I would never use such as  "ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE", indeed will I be put at the stake and burned down?  I have tried using halls, echinacea, codeine but alas nothing has worked.  As I am ever so perceptive I happened to leave my codeine cough syrup out in the light so I doubt that at this point is good for anything other than it's awful taste.  I will do pretty much anything to get rid of this cough if someone was to tell me that showing my naked bum to the full moon while at the same time bathing in goat's milk would cure my cough I would do it.  In any case dim sum was pretty good, as usual I ate too much.  The title of this journal should really be "the adventures of a woman who eats too much and goes to med school to try to teach others about self control and healthy choices".  Yes, I am an example to be followed by all, moderation is my motto.  I tried the fried chicken feet.  I thought it was ok (not my favourite in flavour) but some of my friends could not eat food that looked like a foot.  Which kind of makes me think of the way boars used to be presented at banquets in the past, with the apple in their mouth.  Maybe the apple was supposed to be the salad.  They may have though wow that pig looks like it used to be a nice healthy pig who enjoyed apples.  Maybe people in the past were more connected to their food.  There was no reason to hide the fact the pig was alive at one point, its form may have been beautiful.  It seems like in this culture we don't want to know where our food comes from, we are disconnected from the fact that some food use to have a beating heart, and some may even have had feet.  The most interesting is when people tell me they can have fish, well it has big eyes that are looking at them.  If only fish like chicken feet would make themselves more attractive, the possibilities are truly endless with genetic engineering: chicken born without feet, fish that will not look at you.
