That works, too. ^_^  The kitten's still alive - and by bigger I meant longer, since I can still see it's ribs pretty clearly.  It's getting used to me . . .and by that, I mean that it doesn't take off once every three seconds anymore.  Now it's once every five seconds. ^_^  But tonight it ate til it got full, then looked at me and did this slow, squinty blink thing kittens do - and flopped down (out of reach, of course) and just stared at me. . . .Does this mean I'm making headway?  *shrugs*  Who knows?  But it'd be nice if the people at the gas station would stop asking me what's wrong!!!  And hitting on me, for that matter.
