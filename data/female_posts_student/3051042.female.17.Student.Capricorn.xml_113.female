That's alright... I would say so much more but it doesn't really matter.    Other than that the past few days have been weird but I'm alive. (alone... *back space*... alive). This is the first time I've had trouble typing. I'm too drunk to care right now.    One is the loneliest number... especially when you've just lost all hope.    Ned, if you actually read this, call me please....    And as for everyone else, I'm placing the blame on me. I'm glad I'm too drunk to drive. I'd probably be in New Jersey by now, if otherwise.    Blue-eyed, brown-haired girl.  A youth to each their own  And unmarked graves for the undead  Though these ghosts walk among us  We never divert to such a lifestyle  Beauty's face and Purity's scent  This crowd of beloved ones  Nothing can change the position matter has taken  Self and the state of "one"  A worship of an addictive feeling  Clearance to sleep though I will never partake  Fear that life will pass us by  17 and scared  I never want to miss the good times  Or the lust of pleasure  Thunder rolled over my heart  And all was wondrous  Intoxicated by Euphoria herself  Kiss my lips and let me experience the culinary genius  Taste the majesty that is happiness
