Those are probably my two favorites, although Mrs. Doubtfire is up there too.  I looked on imdb.com because I knew we were forgetting some good ones.  By the way, Dead Poets Society was made in 1989.  I also saw on there that Robin Williams was in a movie actually titled Seize the Day in 1986.  How weird is that?  Not quite twilight zone, but definitely somewhat interesting.  LaChelle came over tonight and we  finally  watched Dawson's Creek.  I have the first season on DVD, and we always say we're going to watch it but we never do.  But since the stupid aggies were playing basketball tonight and preempted Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill, we had to get our wb fix for the night.  I can't believe osu couldn't win a game to help OU out.  Oh well, at least Nebraska beat Texas Tech.  Thanks for nothing, aggies.  Anyway, back to Dawson's Creek.  It was so fun to watch it with LaChelle.  It took us back to high school days.  Ah, yes, the simple days when the toughest decision was where to go to lunch and who was driving.  Or what dress to wear to prom, although that was a bit of a drama since LaChelle and I bought the same dress.  But she was really nice and took hers back because I bought mine first.  Still, those days were so carefree and fun.  Now Field of Dreams is flashing through my head as I long for those great golden glory(notice the use of alliteration) days of youth.  Wow, I guess you  can  relate those movies to life!  Anyway, I think I've rambled enough for one night.  As much fun as the blog is, Jaci needs her sleep.  Besides, the later it gets, the more random my thoughts get, and I'm pretty sure they're random enough already.  Goodnight all!  Boomer Sooner! (I just had to add it!)
