I volunteered for SAFE at the end of May and have done mainly web related things and gave my opinions and ideas. At Saving Antiquities For Everyone, we're commited to the preservation of cultural heritage and the stopping of looting of historical artifacts through public awareness.  In October we're having this big benefit in New York with John Russell, who was the Senior Advisor to the Cultural Ministry of the CPA in Iraq (yes, I copied and pasted that part.) So, they want me to do this video thing... We're doing a lot of simutaneous parties all over the world, hsoted by other members, but I can't do that...especially if it's my birthday weekend. I WILL have SOMETHING I at least want to do this year. They want me to talk about why I want to member of SAFE and about my love of hostoryu and any questions I have for Mr. Russell, etc etc.   WELL   1. Mom wants me to stop the SAFE thing.  She thinks that this woman caling me is a bad thing and that me doing somethinf FOR FREE is a bad thing. AS OF NOW, I WOULD LIKE OT STATE: I refuse to un-join. But this would make video thing complicated to pull off...  2. I am SOCIAL PHOBIC and my problem is what people think about how I look, etc. I jus decided I would do a photo for the website....but..but..a video?  -shrugs, then dies-   I really bring this all up because today Mrs. Cindy called about an e-mail I sent her because my crimson-light.net e-mail went down. Well, amid this conversation, on the other end of the house, my parents started fighting and cussing each other. AND THEM, BEING THEMSELVES, DID IT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD. They sounded like they were standing BEHIND me yelling at each other. Now, who wants to bet that the reason Cindy stopped talking mid sentence, right when my parents got their loudest and started using the "F" word, that she heard them?  -dies, yet again-    I'm going to aplogize for anything she may have heard in the background today in my next e-mail.        Well, I am plugging  urlLink CHRIS , who has been super nice and let me talk to him about this a bit and is a pretty good writer. Check out his Xanga, there. It's mainly writing, but it's good.
