Just as Penman is getting used to how to sail it, and I am too, it fucking breaks  again . Oh well. I  hate science, but if I have passed them, I have just done my last ever peace of science. Yay! Kind of yay anyway, cos if I fail I have to retake them. Cue ppl saying, it'll be fine and I won't fail. God I am pissed off with exams. Grrrr! Damn them into hell, or hades or some other rather unpleasant place. Birmingham, for instance.
