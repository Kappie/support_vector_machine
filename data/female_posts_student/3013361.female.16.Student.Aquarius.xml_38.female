Yet another one of those decisions, having a free hour sounded like such a good idea but now its time to pay the consequences. There are 29 days of summer school left. That is 58 hours. That's 29 days where I'll have to get up way too early for summer and go sit in a stuffy room listening to other bad decision makers make speeches about god knows what. Kill me now.
