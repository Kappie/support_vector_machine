Been perusing my email and other blogs to find people listing what they're thankful for and such.  Don't know that I need to go to such extremes, but we'll see where this goes, and it may just end up to be exactly that.    Received an email from my former Argonaut-editor-turned-lesbian-pal last night.  Ordinarily, such an event wouldn't be much to write home (or even a blog) about, but she doesn't do email.  Not that she's against it morally (you're not, are you?), it's just that it's never really been her mode of communicating.  She's a successful journalist, after all; she makes her living writing writing writing, and I can imagine that the idea of sitting down at the end of a day to write more just to keep in touch with long lost friends across the land would be a bit defeating.  Instead, she wrote from work.  Yay.  And it was such a nice surprise.  So I'm thankful for our chats in her old office and our October Starbucks gay pride sit-in.  Been thinking about my boy.  If you haven't already read on his fine blog, his dad's and step-mom's house is being pulled out from beneath them by the farm Mitch (that's his dad) has dedicated more than a few years' worth of blood, sweat and tears to.  Suppose it's situations (and days, tear!) like these that remind you to get a deal in writing and all, but fucking hell.  The company's given them til March to vacate, and anything could happen between now and then, but still.  Can't quite imagine walking through a house, knowing it's not yours anymore.  And really, if they've decided the folks needed to go in the first place, not sure much trust is being placed in the stability of the move-out date, either.  Could start in on all the "everything happens for a reason" stuff, but this is just shitty; there's no getting around it.  And maybe it is happening to make room for something else bigger and better, but for now, being pissed, hurt, shocked, etc. is allowed.  This could be the part where I say I'm thankful for my parents' house and home, that we can all gather here whenever we want and be secure in knowing that's never going to change.  But actually, with everything that's been thrown at each of us and our families (his more than mine) this and other years, I'm thankful that we'll always have the other to talk/shriek/sob about it with.  And if it all comes tumbling down around 2, we can always gas up the car and head to Jersey, the mixes blaring.  Okay, I think the rest will turn into a list, otherwise, I'll be here all damn day.  I'm thankful for:  Dave's smiles, warm and cheeky alike; wishing him a safe trip home and an even safer week with family;  Carrie's phone calls, messages, pep-talks, determination and perseverance;  Not having to use serial commas on break;  Lorraine;  Susan's refusal to banter with me at school;  Alycia's banter in and out of school;  The London Mixes; and  2003: the year of celebrities, signs and big damn changes.
