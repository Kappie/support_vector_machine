We stayed up watching Sweet Home Alabama until 1 or so and then went to sleep in our beautiful double twin bed bedroom! This house is amazing, the pool is warm and all the families are just as nice as I remember them from our last trip! I hope  you're having fun at home! Talk to all of you soon...o by the way...Bonjour mon ami, Je t'aime *wink wink* au revior!
