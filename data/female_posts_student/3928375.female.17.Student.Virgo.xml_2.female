I was so not used to playing singles- I was tired super fast. Im not even going to mention the score lol. Last night I also hung out with Tom and friends. I was poker queen last night :) I also very much admired Will's new goatee.Funny how college changes people. I really wonder what will happen to me in ten years. And especially what will happen to my sister- what school shes going to go to and what she will look like. Kids change so much every year. She was so cute today; well- she's cute every day. She asked me "why is your phone (cell) on the floor" and she wanted to take a bath with me. She is so funny and extremely bright. She asks, " why do u need to take a shower?" and I told her it was because I was dirty and she says "eww, like a skunk". It was very funny. Well I have to go :)
