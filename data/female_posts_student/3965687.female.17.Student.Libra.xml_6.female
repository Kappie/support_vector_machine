Tonight I was more angry than I have been in a long time, and since I have my father's Irish-Italian temper, that truly is an achievement. The cretin responsible was one of those bottom-of-the-barrel     blue-collar rednecks who drinks copiously and often for no other reason but that he can. He was standing at my counter, looking at the menu board. His son, a cute little blond kid of about ten, was doing likewise, but simultaneously spinning the coin-catcher situated to the left of the second register, and had to raise his right arm up to do it. His father, having made his decision, came up behind his son and shoved his finger into the boy's side, just below the armpit, right at the gland; in martial arts, I've been trained to aim at that pressure point to induce debilitating pain and vomiting. The kid flinched, and so did I. I knew that had to hurt at least a little, for his father had done it with a none-too-gentle hand. He then proceeded to grab the boy's hair and pull him foreward. The boy uttered no protest, and since the man was just dragging him rather than yanking at his scalp, it couldn't have been too awfully painful. But my left hand knotted itself into a fist nonetheless, because of the mere action, and I thought: if he does this in public, what must he do to the poor boy in private? The man caught me glaring at him and said,"You have kids? Well, this is how ya do 'em..drag 'em around by their hair." It took everything I had to just glare. I don't believe I took my eyes off of him unless I was talking to the little boy. The broom was so close at hand....while not the ideal weapon, it is roughly the same size and weight as an escrima, and after training with my jo staff, swinging that would have been nothing. I wanted so badly just to knock this man down to prove a point, but I didn't, and I managed to hold my peace. I caught bits and snatches of their conversation as I cleaned the dining room, and the father would say something in one of those harsh, terse undertones that I could tell was unpleasant, and I even heard him break off in midsentence a few times when I came near enough that I would have been able to distinguish his words, then continue when I moved away. There are few things in life more despicable than hurting a child, and I wanted to run up to the boy and shake him, to say "You don't have to take this bullshit, you know." But it's easy for me, a spectator, to have such thoughts. And earlier than that, an even younger boy had come in with his father. This kid's pants were too short by about three inches or so, and his shirt was worn through in some places. His father was a rather large man with long greasy hair, badly mended glasses, and what seemed an aversion to bathing. He seemed, however, to be a pleasant enough man...rather quiet, bashful. The boy had a resentful quality; he was about seven or so, and he wouldn't look me in the eye. Probably because I was a stranger, but I got the impression that he was perhaps embarrassed about something....I wish, and always have, that I could make up for all the wrongs in someone's life, correct them somehow...especially with children. I know how much it hurts not to have confidence, and think that everyone who criticizes you is in the right. I wish that just a few words, one person believing in you, could be enough. I used to be That Kid, the one who dreaded school, who walked with a bowed head, wearing a hand-me-down windbreaker gotten at one of the rich kids' yard sales, the one who laughed quietly when everyone else said their lives were screwed up because their parents never gave them enough lunch money. But I had that one person to encourage me, at various times in my life. I wonder what would have happened if I'd been like one of these two kids, and had not had that single accepting voice.
