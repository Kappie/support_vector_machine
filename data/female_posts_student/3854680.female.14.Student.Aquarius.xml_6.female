It's weird, because I kept getting woken up by noises around every half hour (7:00, 7:30, 8:00..), and kept blaming my mom since all of the animals were right by me. But I just looked at the alarm clock, and it says that she got up at 5:00, which means she started at 6:00..which means she wasn't even HERE.  ..hm..   Creepiest dream..me and 2 other friends were driving in a car (me being the driver) and this guy pulls out in front of us..I swerve to avoid him and end up going into the other lane, where this semi crashes into my side of the car. Next thing I know, people are by my bedside at the hospital crying and praying and stuff, but I'm like.."wait..am I dead..how can I be standing RIGHT HERE and no one can see me..???"  Then I woke up.   Well, the countdown begins..3 days till I go to South Carolina.
