They have their own party van and they have an ice machine. Who has an ice machine in their home?? When they came home, the mom was like, "Our husbands dragged us to this party with nothing but pimps and whores! We were the only white people there!!!" Okay, I just want my money and to leave. So that was good. Erica and I want to take their party van to prom, but my mom said I couldn't ask.  Today I babysat at Church and then helped my mom with the Easter egg hunt for the kids. Those kids go crazy. Later, I found my underwire had come out of my bra. So, I pulled it out of my shirt, and my mom said, "What is that? A headband?" AHH YES THAT IS JUST HOW BIG MY BOOBS ARE. Thank you. I've been doing some homework and cleaning my room and eating candy. It's a fine life it is. I just got off the phone with my dad and I laughed. AHH, I am actually starting to like my dad, it's scary. Well I'm off to self-tan, one of my Easter presents (that and a Billy Joel CD). WAIT. Let me just tell you this! So I had a bad day a couple days ago, and my mom wanted to give me an Easter present early to cheer me up. So she pulls out... a Hot Topic bag and says, "Isn't this where you shop?" Oh mom! I only get band t-shirts there sometimes. Anyways, she got me a Warped Tour 2003 CD, which is pretty good, and a pair of earrings I kind of like. But then she gets me this pink t-shirt that says "Young and Angry" because she feels that is how I am. AHH I know! Then she gets me... platform flip-flops which are referred to by the receipt as "Black corset thongs" because the strap part has like leather X's across. They're pretty bad, my mom thought I needed tall shoes to wear, basically we're taking them back. It was nice of her anyways, though. Well goodnight!
