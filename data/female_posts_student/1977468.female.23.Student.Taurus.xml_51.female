Your doing your own thing, and the door swings open with a bang. Everyone turns their head. The poser enters, grinning, possibly holding a skateboard for everyone to see, or more offensively a guitar. The poser struts in, feeling the warmth of everyone's gaze while scanning the room for whoever's inperceptive, whoever might think he's cool and accept him. He then heads for the group of impressionable freshmen girls.  He walks with his arms suspended away from his body, as if to incinuate that he has overly developed back and chest muscles, which is never the case. Every hair on his head has been carefully positioned with twizers. He is the textbook definition of whatever is currently "in" at the moment, from what he wears to the music he talks about to the shows on television. More importently he is the textbook definition of whatever his "group" (the crowd he is trying to appeal to) thinks is "in". Therefor his powers are useless outside of his range of influence, his target audience.  As the poser nears this group of girls his eyes sparkle with a sense of determination, as if to say "lets do this." He greets them warmly, following every rule of social engagment. The girls smile and giggle,  boyfriends are great for social standing  each one of them secretly thinks. His conversation is preplanned, he's considered every possible senario. Thus he talks about about nothing for awhile, until they notice the guitar. One of the girls unwittingly says "Oh! is that a guitar?", or "You play guitar?", or "Oh goodie! Play us something on your guitar!" - Interpretation:  Dance for us man puppet !  But thats precisely what the poser is. A puppet. A social shapeshifter adhering to the clichic fantasies of every young girl who has them.  His lip twitches slightly up in the corner,  just what I was waiting for  he mentally chuckles. So he cracks his neck and prepares to pose. He takes his time, as to attract as much attention as possible. After all, the more impressions he can make with one operation the better. He then kneels into the traditional acoustic players position. He'll strum a few chords to "warm up", something obivously only an authentic musician would know about. The anticipation festers.  He then begins the song he's been practicing for a couple months. Posers usaully never have more then 2 or 3 songs. Any song with the key lyrical phrases "my heart", "flying" or "dreams" are highly effective and candiates for poser-worthy material. If your an edgy poser however, look for the the lyrical phrases "falling", "crawling" and anything that has to do with "rain". These are more useful against girls who talk about being into the "heavy" or "hard" music scene, i.e. POD and anything else on your local Alt Nu-Metal radio station.   During the duration of that thing he does with the guitar which people assume is music, he scruntches his face as if to say " Look at me. Look at me being an Artist ." and another face that says " I'm so serious about this song written by someone else about a theoretical situation involving a girl ", faces he both learned off of MCI Commerials and Album covers from his expansive collection of one-week-radio-wonders.  When he finishes he may or may not attempt to conceal the expression of cool satisfaction with himself which he carries on his face.  Operation successful . The girls are probably giggling right now, and some new guy in the corner who doesn't know any better is in envy.  Know this, however. Knowlage and perception... aye, and general social intelligence is the only device in which to detect these people, but be loving. A public thrashing is their worst nightmare. These people will not rejoin authentic society if crippled. Rather, let them dig their own holes. Eventaully they will figure things out through their own means, as painful as they will make them.   Remember: At the heart of nearly every poser is a little boy wanting to be loved... that or a little brat who just needs to be loved... either way they need love.  If they harrass you then also know this: they have a tendacy to alienate and avoid those who are on to them, who have a healthy sense of self confidence, people who are self actualized. So next time a poser shines his Crest-Teeth-Whitening-Strips shiney smile, realize he's a super stupid sauce head and ask him a question about a topic that is actually relevent to life. He'll shudder where he stands.  Interesting Facts on the Poser:  He often has 2 to 3 vassal posers which follow him around and observe his behavior. They are usually victims of insecurity.   The poser will plow through relationships based on social temperature and trends/currents.   The poser cannot stay in one group for extended periods of time, and does not react well to spontanious behavoir   The poser will often change his faction depending on which social resources he's already exhausted.   "Hi everyone, welcome to the Casbah. We're the Quarrymen and we're going to play you some Rock and Roll." John Lennon
