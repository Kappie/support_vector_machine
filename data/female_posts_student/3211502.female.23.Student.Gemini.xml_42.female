I walked over to the door, opened it, and this guy proceedsto tell me this story: "I was supposed to borrow a pot from your neighbor, but he isn't in. Do you have a pot that I could borrow? I need to cook pasta. I'll wash it and have it back to you in twenty minutes."  In shock, I said "Sure." I didn't know what to do. During the next twenty minutes, I worried that I wasn't going to get the pot back. I mean it wouldn't be a big loss if that pot never returned, but it matches all of our other pots and pans. Thankfully, the doorbell rang again, and there he was with my pot, freshly washed.   It was a very strange night. Okay, so who thought I was talking about another kind of pot?! Ha.
