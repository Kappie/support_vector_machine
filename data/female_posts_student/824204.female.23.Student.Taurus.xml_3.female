I've come to figure out some things.   I figured out that you can't change the way you feel, but you can do something to make things feel better.   I figured out that HOPE will make some of the hurt go away. I figured out that GOODBYE doesn't mean always means ENDING.. sometimes its the BEGINNING. I figured out that LIFE GOES on... no matter what happens it has to go on.   The most significant thing is that PEOPLE change.. sometimes its for the better sometimes it for the worse.. but they change.. I'm HOPING one day YOU will change so that our ENDING can mark the BEGINNING and our life can go on.    I will love you always.
