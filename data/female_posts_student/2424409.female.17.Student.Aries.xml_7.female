I have to do i stupid project about the worms humans can contract....it is wrong in so many ways...im sitting next to Miss Emily, who's site is  http://www.bardintraining.blogspot.com, and she feels that same way, no one deserves worms in there butt...The pictures make u wanna vomit, and the info's so descriptive its not much better... you most definetly don't wanna see these pics people there awful...    On a new note...I have allergies, to what i dunno, but my sinuses are acting up hella lately, it sux...And i never had allergies before, why do i have to have them now??    I talked to "todd" yesterday...and i've decided that he'll get whats comming to him, and im not gonna be the one to give it to him...though im definetly not attracted to him anymore, i will still be his friend!    Im soo tired, i've not got a sufficiant ammount of sleep in the past couple days...because i've been staying up working on due projects and studying  for tests that i have to take before the long weekend...it sux lotz but whateves, no biggy, i'll just sleep lotz on the weekend, other then saturday...my dad is comming down on that day, to see us and give us stuff from the "Easter Bunny" that he left at dad's house...like its real or sumthin?? And then I have to go up there on the weekend, and try to make the best of it...so i won't be on the comp from the 16-18 because he lives in the stone age and has no computer, and if he did, we'd never be allowed to go on it, and i doubt it'd even have internet...stupid old people....tee hee hee...well i guess i'd better go and work on this project thing, cuz i think i only have today to work on it, so i gotta get lotza stuff done....Oh ya, and only about a week left in term 3..then i get a spare..YIPPEE!!!!!
