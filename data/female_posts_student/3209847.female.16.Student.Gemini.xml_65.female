Friday, May 28, 2004! -     Last day of my sophomore year. My crazy sophomore year. I'm really glad its over, but very sad at the same time. I'll write my description of my Sophomore year using adjectives that being with "s" (Remember: I'm a dork, so shut up). It was stressful, strange, and sexually awakening.  -     After my two tests which were both relatively easy, Sarah picked me up and we went to her house. Jenny and Leah came over for a couple hours and we pigged out on food and swam. It was soooooo much fun! =D. Lisa came over for about 30 minutes before Jenny and Leah had to leave! -     Me, Sarah, and Lisa swam some more and then watched three movies, Gothika, School of Rock, and Sixteen Candles. It was a lot of fun. I started to become a brat for a while because I felt that Sarah wasn't giving me enough attention. It was incredibly stupid of me.  Saturday, May 29, 2004! -    I was still in a pissed off/angry/depressed mood because of my stupid behavior from the previous day. I just layed around all morning, feeling like the world was going to end. Read a few pages in Catch-22.  -    Sarah tried to cheer me up. She's so sweet. Even though  I  was the one mad and angry, and she didn't do anything, she STILL tried to make me feel better. Is that love there or what? If that isn't love, I don't know what it is.  -    We went to Andrew's house that night to say goodbye to him because he was leaving for college on monday. We watched Spice World! It cheered me up a little bit. -    Started my diet this day.  Sunday, May 30, 2004! -    Basically happy by now, We went to Scarborough fair with Lisa and her parents. Okay it was hot, sticky, and sweaty, but I didn't get a sunburn AND it was a lot of fun -    I did really well on my diet still =) -    Sarah and I got into an argument about another stupid thing I had done. I swear, I fuck everything up. Anyway, we talked it out, and we're better now!  Monday, May 31, 2004! -    First day of Working out! Oh god!! Sore?? YES! -    My mom is cutting me off from laundry service, so I have been doing that non-stop monday and today. -    Sarah came over around 4:00 and fixed my computer! (well as much as she could) It runs alot better now. We then went to California pizza kitchen, and i DEFINITELY cheated in my diet. Yeah. -    Saw "The Day After Tomorrow" I don't care what people say. It was an EXTREMELY good movies. Very thought provoking and emotionally stimulating. I'd say go see it.   Tuesday, June 1, 2004! -    First day of working! I figured out that i don't have to work from 9-5 everyday, which I am extremely happy about! I mean, wow! I'm only working a "part-time" shift you could say. no pay, but its okay, i enjoyed doing it today. I'm working at Casa Manana. On Mondays i work from 8:30-1:00. Tuesdays are 9:00-12:00. Wednesdays are 9:00-1:00. Thursdays are 9:00-12:00. And i might stay afterwards any day that Valerie, the director of education and outreach, needs administrative work done. No work on fridays! YAY! -    Continuing laundry  Okay so that catches everyone up I believe. June 9, my birthday. June 13, ANNIVERSARY! yay! June 16, Sarah's birthday! There's some events that are coming up. Any more June birthdays out there besides Ashley's on June 13? Comment if you have a June birthday that I didn't talk about.   I hope everyone has had a great summer so far! I really have. I don't want it to end. I really don't want to go to Europe right now because I'm going to miss Sarah too much! Oh we got a new background. I hope you guys like it. It's only 16 days in europe so i should be okay. Sarah's optimistic about it, and she says that it's only 5 more days than the Italy trip. We're going to be alright! =). I'm going to be gone on our 7 month anniversary. Oh well! I was gone on our THREE month anniversary during Italy. I think that's a little worse! Haha! Anyways...I haven't gotten a tan, no sunburn at least, which is good. For the rest of the day today, I think I am going to work out again and read some Catch-22! I'll post later!  Bye and *KISSES* to Sarah
