I'm really worried about my future. I don't know anything about what I want! >  Then, there's the Presidential Elections in the Philippines. O God, please help our country.  And, there's the War in Iraq. I believe in the cause, but it's so hard because moral is low... and I know people who are there,  right now .  The Iraqi prisoner torture, the ambushes..   It's just so SCREWED!! I hate how everything seems to be so damned screwed. I hate how ass presidents are elected, how people die over stupid beliefs, how evil always seems to get back at the good. It's so horrible, it makes me angry and sad at the same time.  I hate how human we can be.
