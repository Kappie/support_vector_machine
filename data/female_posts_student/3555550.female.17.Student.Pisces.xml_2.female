After suffering two days straight from the worst headache EVER, I have to sit here and talk to Ben about the chick he likes when I liked him forever. He has to tell me whats so perfect about her and blah blah, and then I'm supposed to give advice. Right. Me. The girl who can't ever keep relationships, who dumps guys once they like her, who is completely scared of commitment, but cries herself to sleep because she craves it. Yeah, please tell the girl that liked you about the girl you like who isn't her.   I just want to smack him.   It's not like I can tell him anything about people I like since one of them goes out with my best friend, so he's out of the picture, and the other is Ben's best friend.  And it's not like anyone takes my crushes seriously anyway.  Just because I am attracted to a lot of people at one time doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when I'm rejected. It's not like I put them up as back-ups. I am hurt everytime I see a guy with a girl. To be this alone feeling this crappy is not fun. fuck all you "glad to be single" fuckers. You obviously are content with your singleness because some loser treated you crappy. I haven't even had the chance to be treated fully crappy. I am never happy. I am always sad. And even when I think I'm happy, I am actually sad. It's all a stupid circle of hell.  My hands are still shaking. I can't believe he is telling me about this girl. It's too hard to be supportive. I mean, he put me through rejection hell. Not even normal rejection...he just plain ignored me until it all cleared itself up. Not a "not interested" or a "just friends" bullshit. Just: PRETEND SARAH ISN'T THERE COMPLETELY DEPRESSED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HER. I WILL GET MY BEST FRIEND TO CHEW HER OUT FOR BEING STALKER-ISH.  creepy stupid fucker. usually I would do everything in my power to get him to not like this stupid bitch, but i realize that is low, and will not resort to that. I just want someone to talk to about the way that I feel. I want to lay in bed a sob right now. But if I do, my parents will ask me what is wrong and then shove pills down my throat to make it ALL BETTER. fuck shit fuck. I just want to cry with someone. I just want someone to listen.  beyond that...  ... I just want to rip my hair out of my scalp. Or ride my bike to the ocean and drown myself. I can't seem to feel content. Everything has a problem with it.  fuck.
