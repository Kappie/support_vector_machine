Hopefully things will brighten up next week otherwise these school holidays would of been a waste of time.   The Past week:   Thursday last week-  was the first night of my drama performances. There was more people in the audience then expected. We made a few mistakes but overall the performance piece was great so i heard.   Saturday-  i performed the last of our drama pieces, there was one at 2pm and the last one at 5pm. both performances was great, no mistakes but there was smaller audiences. At our last reflection i  NEARLY  cried. I guess it was because going to the drama workshops has helped me alot. It's basically the only place i can feel happy and good about myself. Plus i made a load of new friends. In one of the workshops Andrea saw my arm and saw that i carved my name in it and she gave me some really good advice which really helped me out. Saying goodbye was really hard but then again goodbye is for now and not forever. Plus Roushini is gonna have a party before the end of this month so yer it aint the end! and hopefully Chris (the director) will have another set of workshops for us.  Sunday-  was the day of Nathaniel's (my baby cousin) chiristening and Nigel's (Nathaniel's older bro) birthday. No one really paid any close attention to Nigel because the baby was more exciting. So yer we went to the church and after went to the party at my aunty's house. The *Fab 5 especially *Bernice were pretty cut at me cos i spent most of my time catchin up wid my cousins and talking to the other *filo teens. But hey i see the Fab 5 all the time and they'll get over it. The party went till late but i left at 5pm with *JJJ cos they wanted me and *Di to stay over there house for a couple days. According to *Patrick, *Jasper and *Jodelyn hit it off which is funny cos Jodelyn likes him and yer (i think, i so wish i was there.  Monday-  was spent hanging out wid Aunty Jhen and Jeremiah.  Tuesday-   was the same as Monday just chillin and stuff we also painted a table which was fun cos Jeremiah made a mess and Di got cut. *Kuya ley gave me some hash cake and i don't think i got high till mid wednesday at the shops cos it had no effect onme that night. Wednesday- Aunty Jhen went to get her eyebrows waxed and Di and I came along. I was acting so weird cos i'd laugh at everything for no reason but i don't i think it was that hash cake. That night we went home.  Thursday (yesterday)-  The *Cruz's came over except Allister (He was probly working) and yer stayed for a bit. When they left we went to the Morayfield Plaza and i saw *Trent with his mum. I wanted to stop and talk to him but then mum would be like hmmmmmmm..... And that pretty much is what happened the last week.   * the **  Fab 5:  consists of Me, Bernice, Di, Charmain and Nicole. Our families usually do stuff together and now we're pretty close friends.  Bernice:  is a Cruz. She's 11 turning 12 but she looks like a teen. Heaps of people think we're sisters or something cos we're somewhat alike.  Filo:  is short for filipino  JJJ:/strong> Aunty Jhen, Justin (aunty Jhen's boyfriend) Jeremiah is their son.  Di:  My little sister who is now 13 years old  Patrick:  is a Cruz, he's 14 (same age as me)he's like my guy best friend here in caboolture  Jasper:  is a Hughe he's half filo and he's pretty good-looking which is why nearly all the chicks are after him.   Joelyn:  A brissy filo, who's the same age as me  Kuya ley:  is my big bro who's 19. His name is Leo but i call him Kuya for a mark of respect.  Cruz's:  Tito(uncle)Art, Tita(Aunty)Riza, Allister, Patrick, Bernice and Nic.  Well if you bothered to read all of the above congratulations cos it took me ages to type.  better go cos jeyar (lil bro) wants to use the net  ciao, monmon
