There wasn�t a whole lot of people there, and the real party didn�t start until the lead of the show, Kelly (a 14 year-old), left with her parents. Parties, I believe, are best described in keywords�such as: cake, sushi, dancing, Sir Mix-A-Lot, Smirnoff, Corona, Daiquiris, Scott�s House, nicotine, and loud music.  Now that I am not stressing over the job of being a stage manager, I can focus on my life again. I need to get a job and then I need to get a car. I am also rehearsing �Machinal� at the college. I will be playing 3 different roles and then some; bit parts and walk-ons and such. It is going to be a really great show!   So I have had a lot of time to think lately. I know�big surprise. Since I spend so much time RIDING in cars rather than DRIVING them�one�s mind tends to wander. I have decided that I am not educated enough. I have so many friends that quote authors, bands, and playwrights. I know what I talk about, I can relate to what they are saying and respond in an intelligent manner, but I can�t start the conversation myself. I find this to be a problem and short coming on my part. I need to be able to keep up with my peers and understand, comprehend, and relate to a lot more of what they say and think!  With this thought running through my mind, I think about maybe going back to school. Educating myself and rounding out my personality. I currently pay no rent, have no car or insurance payment, and will only have to work part time to cover the other bills I have every month. Time wise I could work it out�but then the question is raised of how I will pay for it. It is times like these that I wish there was someone to make the decisions and tell me what to do and also be there to make sure everything works.  Student aide would be a logical choice�although they maybe a little upset with me that I haven�t started paying what I already owe them yet. And what would I do if I went to a University out of town? This brings up so many MORE things to think about. It is easier not to, but alas�that is not a choice as well.  I will stay here and wallow in my state of confusion for a while longer and let you be on your way.
