Currently, I am materialistically in love with both lip gloss and coffee pots.    Lip Gloss:  Lip gloss and I have always had a flirty thing going on. I have always been in love with the idea of lip gloss, but for some reason, I could never fully commit to rigorous applications the stuff. I would buy a new lip gloss, use it a few times, and then toss it into the depths of my makeup bag. I'm not really sure what has changed. Perhaps it was the attacks on 9/11 or the war in Iraq that has forced me to put things a bit more into perspective. Thus, I find myself married to Burt's Bees Wax Lip balm. But of course I am not faithful, but rather a glorified polyandrist among lip balms. Usually, I like to apply a base coating of lip balm, and then give sloppy seconds to a nice fruity lip gloss on top. Sometimes, I prefer something with a bit of color. It just depends on my mood, and it's fickle.   Coffee Pots:  Coffee Pots and me merely have been friends for years. Strictly platonic. We would meet up at social occassions with friends, usually at Starbucks and the like. Sometimes we would hang out everyday, even multiple times a day. Other times, we wouldn't see each other for weeks, perhaps months. Gradually, things have become more serious. At the beginning of last year, I bought my own coffee pot that brewed just a single cup of coffee. It wasn't until around finals time last semester that coffee and I really became close. So close that I have upgraded to a 12-cup coffee pot. Now, that's love!
