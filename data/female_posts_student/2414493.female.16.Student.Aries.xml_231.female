Everything's just beginning, and it's beautiful.  I guess you could say that today's the last official day of freedom since classes start tomorrow and with that comes homework and reading and the like. The last day left blissfully untinted with obligation, at least. I'm ready for whatever comes, though. It's the dorky, scholarly side showing through.   Went to church this morning for the first time in a long time. Actually, not this morning if this program is still on western time...it's 12:41 am as I type. Memorial Church is everything you'd think a church to be. As Matt and I were walking in, there was Handel playing on an organ, and one could only stare in awe at the vaulted ceilings, the corinthian columns...just everything on such a magnificient and ornate scale that it beats any "normal" place of worship I've seen. Well, I can definitely say I've forgotten a lot of what I've learned in church, but I think it's probably a good habit to start again.  Woke Charlie up, went to the activities fair, got lunch. Waited in line for three hours--my fault, of course--for Yale and Brown trips. The guys are going to Newport, I'm almost tempted to go too. Should I? It's another $25 and Mom and Dad could probably take me. Oh, but I want to be home for registration. That just occurred to me. Went to Starbucks, met up with Jen, had a good, solid conversation. I must admit it's really nice to be talking like that...everything around here lately is so superficial (as in, merely scratching the surface) since nobody knows each other. I know the danger of just staying friends with home people, but for now they're excellent company. And it's funny. I think I get along better with guys than I do with girls.   Sarah, Ishita and Shoan Yin rented a microfridge. I was the only one who opted out. I feel like a loser.   Aunt Hong Ha also tried to drop some food by, but I either wasn't there or didn't get reception. I felt so bad and sat through the rules meeting with a knot in my stomach. I was itching to go, but only to see if I could catch them before they decided to give up and leave. Well, I didn't. But I activated my voice mail and found 10 messages, haha. Next Friday I'll see them. I feel bad, though. I mean, I don't know how I would've made it through early Saturday without getting a ride from them to Harvard, but I really don't need them now. But I feel an obligation to be nice for Mom's sake. I'll work it out.  Rules, rules, rules. But it turns out we can have weekend stayovers with us, as long as a whole bunch of people consent.  Classes start tomorrow. I think I'll preview Principles of Editing just because, and then I have psych in the afternoon. I'm meeting Charlie and Matt and Jen and taking Shoan Yin with me to breakfast. See, I think meals are awkward. There's 1000 kids and it's outright scary to expect to walk into Annenberg alone and find someone you know and can bear. So I think we'll stick together for the next few days, at least. Until schedules are settled.  I really had a good day. I wonder what I'm going to do now, though, if I prefer guy company to that of my dorm mates. We'll see. It's late. I'm kind of hungry, but I'll sleep it off. And there's always the promise of breakfast.
