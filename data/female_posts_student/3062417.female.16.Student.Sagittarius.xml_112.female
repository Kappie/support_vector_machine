I can't even describe how I'm feeling inside anymore. For the past couple of days I've just been so down. I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning. I seriously think that if something terrible happened to me and I died right now noone would even notice that I'm gone. It's a terrible feeling to feel so alone and so hopeless. All I want to do is have *someone* hold me in their arms and just let me cry. That's really all I need right now.  Every day it gets harder and harder to pretend that I'm happy and I don't think anyone even notices how unhappy I truely am. Noone has any idea how hard it really is to literally put on a fake smile as you walk out the door in the morning and not be able to take it off until you walk back in that door. I don't even know if anyone cares. I just can't take all of this anymore. I need to get away from everything. I'm sick of everyone. I need to find some new friends that I can actually talk to about how I'm feeling. (no offence to my friends-I heart you all)  Everything is closing in around me and every day it gets harder to breathe. I'm drowning in a pool of misery. I just need to find someone that I can share this with. Just someone that understands where I'm comming from.  I just don't want to talk to anyone anymore. There's only one person that I feel I can talk to right now and that's Gavin but I can't even tell him everything.  I just hate being alone so much. I'm alone about 3 or 4 nights a week lately from 4-10 and I hate it. All I want is someone to spend that time with me. Someone to fill the void in my life. Someone to make me feel remotely happy again.  My mom hasn't been home much lately and I don't really have a father figure in my life. My mom even missed me play in the concert last night for the first time ever. You have no idea how much that hurt me. There's noone home to guide me in the right direction and I feel like I took a wrong turn a long time ago and I'm just completely lost.  I try to cry. But I can't. My emotions just continue to build up inside of me and I become more wreckless every day.  When will I hit rock bottom? Or is this an bottomless pit?  [Out Of Control by Hoobastank]  I've done everything as you say I've followed your rules without question I thought it would help me see things clearly But instead of helping me to see I look around and it's like I'm blinded  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you I don't understand what you want from me  I feel like I'm spinning out of control Try to focus but everything's twisted  And all along I thought you would be there (Thought you would be there) To let me know I'm not alone But in fact that's exactly what I was   I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you All of the things you've said to me  I may never know the answer To this endless mystery  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me  Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control...  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you All the things you've said to me  And I may never know the answer To this endless mystery  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control
