Who want sunday to pass so quickly and welcome monday when work to starting again!? I want more holidays!! hehe. :D. In such a great mood. It's always great to be back in school even though a whole lot of examinations are waiting for us yet again... Monday! The energy booster of the week! LOL. Well. It's so bad to start a fresh day like this, sitting in the parade square under the sunshine, listening to the principal talking like eternity. Well. After that, we headed back to our classes, sit down and started the day. One good thing is that ray chua is not here! Two bad things is that there're going to be history test on wednesday and the chinese spelling afterwards. But it's music after reccess! so it's time to cheer up! Music, is my passion. But it's really not my thing...I passed the four levels and thus headed to the fifth. However, I almost passed with a 47%. "Bravo".  For the entire day, I felt so sick. I'm down with flu and had no idea why I got it. I just woke up and found my nose blocked and kept on sneezing like madness.  After common test, I packed my bag and followed them out of the school gate. At first I thought I am going back home, but I was thinking and then I dun feel like going home afterall. Thus, the six of us boarded the bus to west mail, I as the outcast. =P. Whatever. It's quite an enjoyable time, really, with the exception from those who sat beside the old lady who criticised about our school and bragged about her own children. I really felt like bashing up the lady after I heard it from my friend. It's really rude and insulting and she showed no respect to other schools! Not really bashing, mind you. But it's REALLY REALLY TOO MUCH!  The day went on quite nice actually. except that I'm quite sick. I reached home, cut my hair. it felt so refreshing.  I remembered that memory flashed back when I saw Jaslyn boarded the famart train. Yes. I remembered it so well and perfectly. It started off with a clear blue day. Then, it started to drizzle. Then. It started to rain. We were running like mad in order to reach farmart, "unwet". But it's a too naive thought. Everybody was wet. Even me, who was holding the umbrella. We went there, look around thn walked back to school! OMG. It's my first ever trip to farmart, but it's also quite fun. Till now, two years had passed, but I still remembered it. Cos it's my first ever trip being wet while walking...
