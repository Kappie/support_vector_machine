You told me that you saw  Adaptation (another self-indulgent Charlie Kaufman movie), and you said that it "is an incredible movie, because of the outstanding performance by Nicolas Cage". But you wrote in your last post that  Training Day  is a decent movie, even though Washington gave a great performance. So tell me why you don't hold Charlie Kaufman's movies to the same standard as all other movies.  I wasn't trying to say that the AFI choosing Lector lacked imagination and originality(which I feel it did). I was trying to say that you choosing Lector lacked imagination and originality. One of your reasons for choosing him, as you wrote in your first post, was that the AFI chose him. And with the exception of your #4 choice Catwoman, All of your villains were in the top 15 on the AFI's list. I have tried to stay off-beat, granted The Joker and Alonzo Harris are both on the list(#45 and #50), but I felt there performances are vastly underrated.    As for your opinion on Agent Smith, you said it yourself "he is the perfect villain in the first  Matrix  film, and I mean perfect." Now that is a direct quote from your post, but you had the audacity to say that overall you are not convinced. I agree with you that the two sequels were gaudy monstrosities, but like I said, I am choosing to focus on the first film. The first  Matrix  film is the only one that can stand alone as it's own movie(taking place months before the two sequels). And I think  The Matrix  has done more for cinema than any other movie in the last fifteen years, due in no small part to Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Agent Smith, one of the greatest villains ever.  I really can't comment much on your choice for #1. I know it sounds bad but I have never seen  Schindler's List . I'm sure Ralph Fiennes gave a powerful performance, I sure that it was an intensely powerful movie with an emotional swing very few movies have ever been able to obtain. But like I said, I haven't seen the movie, so I cannot cast a decision on Amon Goeth being a great villain.  Now it is time to reveal my last villain. Another underrated performance by an actor who has given us one of those characters that you love to hate. Joaquin Phoenix delivered a performance for the ages when he brought Commodus Aurelius to life in  Gladiator . What defines a villain? Webster's dictionary states "a wicked or evil person". How wicked is Commodus? He kills his own father when he discovers that he will not be Caesar. He orders death upon the person in which his father was to name as the next Caesar. He commands the death of that man's family as well. When he finds out that his sister has betrayed him, he threatens the life of her only child(his nephew). Russell Crowe gave a tremendous performance as Maximus. We have seen that many times actors and actresses cannot hold their own opposite Crowe. But I truly felt at times in  Gladiator  Crowe had trouble holding his own against Phoenix. Commodus was the first villain that came to mind when I asked the question "who are the greatest villains in the history of cinema". All this makes Commodus a no-brainer in my opinion.
