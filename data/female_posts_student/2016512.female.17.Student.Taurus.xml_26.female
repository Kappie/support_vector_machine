I don't want to get all Hallmark or anything, but we all have worked really hard to get where we are today, and I think we should get at least  something  of a self-esteem boost from that acknowedgement. Do you get my point?  You guys--we need to have a good summer. Need. I don't have a lot going on, so I'm expecting lots of lunch dates, lots of movie parties, lots of bike rides and walks. AND, I want to plan a sandwich toaster party at my house. I'll bring the toaster if you bring the fun. Actually, I read the box, and it's a "Snackster." How quaint! I love it. There's even a recipe guide in the owner's manual, so we can make all sorts of edible jazz. I used it for the first time a few days ago, and it worked out well, despite the fact that I couldn't really find anything to cook in the sandwich. I resorted to using bread, dry salami, and graded parmasean cheese. It turned out pretty well, but I have plenty of room for improvement, and I need some guinea pigs; any volunteers?  Well, I have plenty to do today. I think I'll mow the lawn because that relaxes me a bit. I like being able to see what I've accomplished.  PS: Betso--did the pump work out? I hope it's running smoothly.
