I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do.  And your hair smells of smoke.  Who will cast the first stone?  You can sin or spend the night all alone.  Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold in the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone. You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start.  If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart.  Cause it's all you can be.  You're a drunk and you're scared.  It's ladies night.  All the girls drink for free.    like i no alot of whoever read this might not no what night im talking about but its something that happened a year ago this february vaca im not gonna post it on the blog becasue its kind of private but maybe you might understand by this hint o well umm i had a good day so far its fn cold out like -4 with a windchill of -25 what the f is that about im asking you lol i hate this cold weather :   The time has come for colds and overcoats.  We're quiet on the ride,  we're all just waiting to get home.  Another week away, my greatest fear.  I need the smell of summer,  I need its noises in my ears.    yea all these quotes it may even look like i wrote alot lol well im gonna go watch heather and joe play a game its kinda fun o yea i cut my self yesterday right well i ripped off hte peice of skin that was hanging off cuz melissa and joe like made me and adam did too but he wasnt in shop when i did it ok im gonna go   bye
