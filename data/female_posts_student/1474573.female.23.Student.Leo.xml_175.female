I'm not going to Honduras to go see a guru, but my soul is being thoroughly searched.    I just need a break y'all   Tap on my window, knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want   -Maroon 5   Till next time
