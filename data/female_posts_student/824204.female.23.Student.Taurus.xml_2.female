How does one go from having a wonderful, maybe not perfect but almost harmonious relationship to that of something I can't even begin to describe...   It's funny how you think you know someone and then you find out that you really don't.  It's funny when you think about the past.. you still smile at how things used to be even though your heart is breaking and your tears are falling.   It's funny how you go from one relationship full of lies just to end up in a worse one with even bigger lies and deception..   It's funny how you would stand up for someone and have them stab you in the back and then act like it's all good.. like they didn't do anything wrong...  It's funny how you can make love with someone when all along... it's just sex..   You feelin me yet?  It's funny how I use the word funny and I'm not laughing...
