Anyway, aside from my wonderful rhyme making abilities I can also make websites *cough* In FrontPage temporarily *cough*. It should be up soon in some nice shades of blue :) So calming.  My otolaryngologist(Ear, Nose and Throat) appointment is on Monday. I have my hearing back, which is a good thing, but i have to have a hearing test before I see the consultant.  I also think my wrist is sprained as it hurts like hell when i bend it. Thank You Clare!  My History Book Review is in for Monday and I have not started the book.  I must be the most organised person in the world right now :)  xx
