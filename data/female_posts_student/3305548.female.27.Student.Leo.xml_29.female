(Woot $28.00 being my first check of the summer...) and we splurged just a wee bit. Wee bit. Triple feature paycheck = triple feature movie!!!!  We went and saw a Matinee of "Day After Tomorrow." I really wanted to see it and dragged my husband (can we say "role reversal" I thought we could...) It was the best "end of the world/disaster" movie yet. I guess I should invent a ratings system...but I dont know how to do that and still keep the genre in mind. I dont see how I can rate movies from different genres against each other...I would naturally rate favorite genres higher thus...missing the point really. I will try to rate the movies within their "class" to help people get a better perspective of a flick. Thus comparing to other similar movies.  The good: The plot/story line. No one tried to stop the natural occurences (no missles or nuclear warheads put into a storm or military rescue mission against all odds ala "Independence Day", "Deep Impact" or any of those other corny ass movies. Nature was not to be conquored, it was to be survived. Jake Gyllanhall (sp?) - need I say more? And it left me chattering in my seat...which means that it was good/real enough to encompass me in the world of the movie and thus feel several degrees colder. Its the most likely scenario type for "the end of the known world" and I think a good job was done representing Meterologists as cool people we ought to know, and the government that gets choked up on its own bueracracy and causes more problems before it solves an issue. Yep. Good work. Oh and no overblown heroic/tragic soundtrack. What a relief.   The Bad: Eh, well the time scale seemed a little forced...but it did have to fit into a two hour movie...and the pressure had to stay on in order to keep the "edge of your seat" effect cranked. It made several people in the audience have to pee. It dealt with the typical divorced family further split by disaster and their togetherness and importance blah blah blah. Not even 5 natural disasters could bring my family back together - although it might be interesting to see the weather try. Some production inconsistancies...the very important little red line drawn on a map for evacuation moves from one shot to the next...about 400 miles north...I know they must have used more than one dog to represent the Border Collie pet dog and the markings are distinguishably different, and why not burn Niche? He believe in the nothingness of our world and would be proud to have his book burned as the annihilation (think: nihilist) of the known world was occuring.  The Ugly: Some plot strings left loose. The boy with cancer? What happens to him in the end? Suprisingly the audience cares. Going back for survivors is all well and good, and it makes sense that there would be some. But did they go back to any city other than NYC? What became of LA? The West Coast mysteriously ceased to exist after the opening sequences. And although I really liked the space station perspective added in...why was it that they were always staring out the window for quite a while before they commented? It was like scene: pause...pause pause..."Look at this!" All the cosmo/astronaust did was stare out the window apparently... and we didnt need the dramatic pauses. Oh and what did the rest of the world do? We got international perspectives up until the solution/coping phase of the movie. Then nada. So where did all the Russians go? Or are we to assume the rest of the world died and only "Americans" will lead the world forward from the Southern Hemisphere. Most important plot drop: the Scottish Weather Station personnel. We understand that they are doomed...but we never really see what happens.  Still, for a disaster/end of the world movie and summer popcorn flick - I recommend seeing it. Its not oscar worthy (other than maybe for computer icicle effects and whatnot...) but its still worth a matinee at least.  Ack...Bear is home an hour early from work!!! Blogging time to be...cut short...drastically...(think Captain Kirk)  My husband and I also went last night to a Drive In double feature. Drive in theatres are rare any more, and it was a nice treat. We saw "Hellboy" and "13 going on 30" Both of which I enjoyed for different reasons. And was worth the $3.50 per flick.   Hellboy isnt the top of the best comic book movies of all time by any stretch (This List Being: The First Batman, the original Superman movie, Spiderman I, Dick Tracy, and XMen I and II...) But it does rank slightly above "Daredevil" in my book and somewhat better than the "Hulk" far better than "Spawn". Within its genre it falls right after the bastions of the comic book genre...and some of their sequels. Somewhere right after Batman III (which is ranked above Batman II in my book - I am sucker for Poison Ivy and still waiting for Harley Quinn) and before Superman III.  "Hellboy" is one of the few comic book based movies that recognize the character as being from a comic book within the movie. I have to give props for working this into the plot effectively. Some great momemts: spying from the top of a building eating milk and cookies with a random kid, horn moments, the pervasive human-ness of this demon character and his love for cats, rescueing kittens moment, and actually some decent one liners for a change. James Bond take note. Fish guy character - loved him!!! Where's his spin-off??? Bonus for Selma Blair...although she didnt put alot of effort into the underused role she was still the coolest "fire starter" since Drew Barrymore. Ron Perlman did a great rendition of the demon monkey himself...and deserves more credit than he got in the critics circles.  Downsides? Somewhat obscure character that didnt generate large box offices. Overuse of computer graphics (and lack of quality in such graphics according to my hubby) Everyone knows the Nazis were bad...we didnt need more proof. And most of the audience has no clue really who or what Rasputin really was...other than seeing Anastasia. So the roots of the comic are set deeply in history that is mostly obscured and unknown to the contemporary audience. Eh, and I had a little trouble with the opening scenes and their anachronisms in technology and concept. If a gateway to hell was opened during WWII I dont think it would look like something from "Contact."  Right oh then, still an engaging and entertaining Comic Book romp with lots of closeups of red pecs. I recommend rental or second run since its out of the theatres mostly now. See it some night when you are doing a comic book double feature.   13 going on 30...I enjoyed immensly and made me wish ZoZo and NicNic were with me! (Even if ZoZo is 14 now...) *sniff sniff* It was funny and well done...and full of imperfect characters to varying levels. I like the concept of a life gone wrong...when you dont even remember what it was that you did...and what to do now? Good: Jennifer Garner's performance as a 13 year old stuck in a 30 year old body, some nice touches and visual gag moments. The 80's flashbacks were fun...but does anyone know what Razzle is? Somewhat original story line (See "Big") and in the first version of the wished for grown up life...things dont all work out. Love that. And TomTom (Lucy) is the kind of girl we all love to hate. The thirteen year old sleepover...great conceptual moment. Loved that.  Bad: The ending was more than unclear. I dont want to ruin the ending but I was left wondering what happened really? Did she zoom back to 30 as a jump from 13 or are we to assume that she lived her life in a milisecond to get to the last scene? Hmmm. It raises some serious plot questions... The Poise magazine editor in chief put in a dismal performance. Rowan Atkinson would have done better...and I really dont like Rowan Atkinson. Perfect casting choice? Rupert Everett. ("My Best Friend's Wedding" - played part of Julia Robert's gay friend...not to caddycorner or typecast him as gay...as that was really barely touched on or indicated in 13 going on 30...) He would have done a much better job. So would have Mr. Bean. And thats saying something.  The Ugly: That green/rainbow dress. Ick. Her general fashion experiments were kind of scary. Even scarier than an 80's 13 year old would have chosen. Plus 1987 was not really (to my memory) what they portraid it as. I was in 5th grade in 1987 and remember it well...We had moved past most of the hideousness of the eighties and were starting to blend into the pastel hideous era of the 90's. Music had started to revert to R blech...and the golden years of the eighties...ala Thriller would have been old news...and uncool to the kids of 1987...Michael Jackson was already a has-been. They played out the 80's as 1984...which was the quintessential 80's year...) not 1987 per her age requirements.  Still a good flick...catch a matinee if its still in the theatres...and dont forget the popcorn and for the hell of it - its the perfect movie to dress up for...as in dress like you are from the 80's. Oh, and retro as cool...hadnt been born yet in 1987...so Jenna would have no concept of something being so retro that it would be cool. Just a note.  Allrighty theres the triple feature. One note: my hubby wants to see a "Hellboy" and "Passion of the Christ" double feature. What will happen to the world if he ever owns his own movie theatre? Ack!  Likely to have another triple feature next weekend with Harry Potter, and more Drive In goodness with Van Helsing and Connie and Carla. Woot! Oh, and the Drive In food is good, bathrooms clean, mosquitoes werent bad, it was a little chilly, and there were some pretty annoying teenagers present. But all in all the Jungle Drive In just needs some marketing badly.  Pembroke Welsh COrgi...we have decided to expand our potential dog breed interests. There are alot of reasons a beagle isnt a great apartment dog...and I have a sense that we need to make dog ownership as simple as possible. I first "met" the Corgi as a breed in the anime series "Cowboy Beebop" which is completely awesome and requires no level of anime geekness to enjoy. WATCH IT!!!! Great Blues music featured as well. "Ein" is a cool character and although I dont think any corgi we get will be able to hack computers...its still a cool dog. :) There are rescues for adult corgis and corgis are represented in shelters in our area...and there are West Virginia and close Ohio breeders as well. When it gets closer to the time when we can have a dog...I think I will have ample contacts. Its important to get a dog that will blend with your lifestyle and living arrangements. Corgis seem flexible and apt city living dogs... I will post a piccy of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. My Welsh travelling friends might be more familiar with them...  NO BOOTY BLOGGED HERE.  I did discover car sales on EBay...and when August comes upon us and my BIG financial aid payment is here...it may be a potential source for a new run around car for me...Nothing fancy..but the cars are newer and less expensive...(I found a 93 Mercedes for $1950 - $1000 less than what the local guy wants for a 83 Mercedes...sheesh!) and its in EBays best interest to offer some buyer and seller protection - and many of the sellers are dealerships! Roadtrip anyone? Right well then, I wont get hooked on EBay for another couple of months yet...And I will still peruse the local shops...I wont give up on finding a good car in my own backyard.  Going to my mother's tonight...ug. She has baited me with the promise of my cousins who are too cute and cool to resist. Tomorrow will be family day with the inlaws...and then who knows what after. More news to come after I survive all of this mess. THings are getting less happy with my mother in law...although she doesnt know it...I am getting less and less pleased with her in general. What is it with me and moms?  But there you have it for now...All the News in Fits of Print. And then some. --Mack
