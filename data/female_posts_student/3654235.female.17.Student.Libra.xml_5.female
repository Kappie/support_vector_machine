I spent the night at Angela's the past 2 nights along with a bunch of other Fusion girls... we stayed up late both nights  had "girl talk." There was also some late night swimming, batter-eating, cooking, scary phone calls (which turned out to only be Nathan), chick-fil-a runs, movie watching,  video camera mishaps (sorry Jess! haha) So much fun...     Tonight was Danielle's birthday party. We had fun hanging out, dancing (cha-cha slide rocks!), and eating. I'm spending the night with her tonight... so I gtg b/c I gotta get up for Sunday School in the morning. Bye bye! Love, Jenna
