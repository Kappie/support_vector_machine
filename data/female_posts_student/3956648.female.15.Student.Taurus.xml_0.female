I hope that if my parents do get a devours that I don't have to move. I hope that my mom (who will be the person I'm going to live wit) stays here in Cherokee. But they way they was acting today I don't think that they will get a devours but like my mom says "only time can tell" man I think I deserve some ice cream. well I don't think my parents would think the same way because I guess I am the reason for them spreading further apart. Which to tell the truth really fucking sucks. I think I might have said that in the last blog. Oh yeah Jessica you know how I said that I was gonna become (you know what) well today I ate a lot of the funnel cake shit. And just to let you know you don't make funnel cake with just water and flour. HA HA HA Member when you told me that on the phone. I miss ya gurly. I hope my dad talks to my mom and lets me babysit. But my thing is will that lady let me. I mean she don't even know me. But yeah I am gonna go clean my room and vacuum it.   LOVE PEACE AND MUTHA FUCKING CHICKEN GREASE!!!  Q TO THE P HOLLA
