Home, is where I am, Here, is where I land. The place where I make friends, Is where I'll always defend.  Though I may leave somday, But I'll always be sure to say, You always find a way, To let me have my ray.  Singapore, where Home is the Best.  Dedicated to Singapore for her 39th Birthday.    Happy Birthday, Singapore!
