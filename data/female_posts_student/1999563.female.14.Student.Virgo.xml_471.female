When I reach 60,000 we shall have to have a big par-tay! :)   Today I have to go to the dermatologist with my brother for some cryptic reason. Then I have to go to the orthodontist. Yuckkkk! I also need to start studying for my spanish test. I am so nervous! I always do really bad on spanish tests for some reason. They are dummbb!   A person from my old rowing team got a scholorship to go to yale because of his rowing talent..isn't that coool?! I wish something like that would happen to me, but alas, it never does.  I want to go a really coool college. I'm thinking maybe in florida because I love beaches and its just the perfect temperature during the school year. :) But, I really want to go to somewhere on the east coast (i know, florida is on the east coast..but the northern east coast!) I love big cities and everything but its just so stinking cold! I hattteeeeee cold!   I better go...skin doctor time! :/  Laura Fantora
