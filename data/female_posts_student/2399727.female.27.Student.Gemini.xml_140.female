We're eliminating the Xalatan on a trial basis because she discovered some inflammation in my iris that wasn't there before (perhaps an allergic reaction to the Xalatan or Alphagan, but historically, Xalatan is harder on patients so we're going to get rid of it first.)  The inflammation might explain why things have been so painful recently.  She's going to do a letter for a Canada Study Grant for high-need individuals with permanent disabilities and she's going to send in the CNIB registration form so they can help me with visual aids.  My vision hasn't changed since the last visit so we're both glad about that, and the pressure was good today (13 O.S., 16 O.D.).    urlLink     urlLink     I got an email from my course advisor at USMC and we're going to meet early next week to select my courses. I'm hoping for 2 philosophies and 3 theologies per term.  I also have my eye on a history of Church music course (for upper-years, unfortunately) that, I think, would be a nice respite for me.  More to come...
