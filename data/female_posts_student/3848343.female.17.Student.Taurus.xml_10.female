I sat on msn and dyed my hair...back to the same colour it was b4 but at least now i dont have my inch or two of regrowth hahaha. It was sooo totally freezing today...not funny! mummade me go and pick up my sister from work with her and well we came outside to see that the SES was there cleaning up a tree that had fallen right outside our house ...we didnt even know hahaha. so yeh as u can tell my day was sooo boring up until about 5.30ish (except for when i got to talk to my sanja who came back from perth woohooo...got to hear stories about her basketball hotties...yes please) when i started getting ready to go meet the girls. I made mum drop me to jennys and then her mum drove us to my dads to pick up our video camera and then we went to beverlly hills for dinner. We got there b4 everyone else and were standing on the corner (no not putting out) freezing ourselves. Jenny decided to try and hide between two bushes and well she hurt her legs and couldnt even lift them...was hilarious hahha...Kate and alana arrived together and then mine and alanas mum rip round the corner in a car and there is my mum shouting "SHOW US UR PINK BITS"....she didnt realise i was recording....stupid woman lol hahahaha... finally as everyone arrived including sarah, bridey and then kirily we got them each on video and made them do a little dance for us (this video is mine and jens lil recording basically of this whole year...or untill we run out of tape...we arent allowed to watch it untill it is totally finsihed then we can laugh for hours)...shake ur bootys gals ...Mwhahahawe walked the streets terrorising people, then we ate our dinner at "3rd rock cafe", ate gelati at "mama mia" and then met up with the people giving us lifts....i will fill u in on all the fun details but....things brings me to the topic    [+] things we did on our Beverly Hills adventure     asian fish boy -  our first target was this guy in the asian reseraunt. Along the front of the store were these fish tanks filled with big fish and lobsters and well this man just happened to be at the window. we filmed him grabbing some tray at the bottom of the tank, i think we was pulling out pipies or soemhting and he kept showing us them, i dont think he go it...all i wanted was thumbs up..but what can i say my message probably got lost in translation - couldnt understand aussie hand signals lol....  some boy in a resteraunt -  all we did was walk past and there is this guy looking outside going OMG so gave him a few dirties back lol....stupid dick. lol...  two ladies in DtoD cafe -  just happened to be alana and my mum, we had the camera on them i think we embarresed them enough considering they were at the back of the cafe and everyone in there could look out the glass window and see what we are up to lol... =>....no shame girls!!!  ate dinner at "3rd rock cafe" -  most of had the chicken parmagania with chips and some got the chicken rissotto but jen chose to get the childrens menu and have he chicken snitzchel...lol...after laughing at these women we thoguth were lesbians behind us we ate our food and then just filmed ourselves at our best...bridey and her laughing...we had a nice convo about a dildo shop and were trying to keep it subtle untill the waitress goes "dun worry i know where the told shed is (that being the name of the shop"...we were like omg hahhahahaha. We payed our bill and then left after jenny got her ice cream that she got cause she ate a kids meal hahaha. we decided we wanted desert so we left that store and went walking around  kebab boi -  on our travels as we were crossing the road some guy outside of the kebab store started shouting to us so OF COURSE we started filming him hahaha....we decided to cross the road and go back that way considering we were going to eat desert on that side and well stopped tot alk to this guy on the way....bridey should never be given a camera cause she chooses to do close ups on ppl that are just not called for....plus that guyw wanted bridey bad "cya sexy mwa" hahahaha...hook in b!!!  asian in the milk bar -  this man just wanted to be famous. we had the camera on him the whole time, annoying him, asking stupid questions, of course bridey zoomed in way to close and got a good view of ALL his black teeth....eewww...he kept showing us his kids and we told him we were from aussie idol hahaha....he loved it...gave us free lollies which tastes good to start off with but then were like eating dry off milk....just so u know thats NOT a good thing!    mamma mias -  got to love the italians aye hahaha...the place was filled with italian stallions *cough* behind the counter lol...one which was sooo hot i dont knwo what was hotter his smile or double chin, i will let sarah decide....u have the italian blood after all....she said she will only go for them if they have 4 or more houses...talk about the standards lol ...we did some more filming inside the store, just of us eating ice cream, everyone having there own stlyes ; )....kate if i ever see u pretend to lick out an ice cream again i think i will slap u but yeh it was allll good =>    crossing the road -  who ever thought that crossing the road could make the night for us. We thought we might let bridey score some points out of it (its our daring sysatem...who ever ends up with the most points gets a prize) so we all corssed king georges road and were standing in the land strip in the middle of the road...she was gonna get points if she pissed in the bushes..but she decided that the bushes were small and evryone could see here...not a suprise considering it was MAIN ROAD lol... on the way the two cripples alana and jenny (jenny cause she hurt her legs at netball) couldnt even get onto the land strip at first and then wen we had to cross the road i dropped brideys il purse and were praying the cars woudlnt run over it....luckily for me they didnt...lol... that pretty much concluded our night other then the drive home with jenny across all our laps hahahaha.....boney ass bitch.... so yeah as u can see i had a fun night, for me anyway lol...hahaha its great just haingoing out with the girls....ur all the best....hopefully next time more of u can make an effort to come aye lol..jksjks..i dont think i have anythign else to say....but here is a quote    ".....Why must I be the one who has to know?I'm not the one who messed up big time, So spare me the details if you don't mind...."
