Her sister may be psycho, but Katie's pretty cool sometimes :)  Muahahahahaha...  Anyway...  Hopefully I get to see Ken tonight... He called me around 9:30 last night and was all like "Will you be terribly disappointed if I don't come over tonight?" then he listed his reasons why, and told me he'd come over right after work tomorrow.  Of course I was just like "No, that's fine" and we said good-night and that was it.  I mean honestly, what was I supposed to say.  "No, that's not fine, I want you to come over right now."  Dur...  but yeah, I'm gonna go check my eggs..  See if I can get rid of this damn craving...
