N*E*way it'll probably just be my luck that i won't get to stay the night out there, b-cuz my mom has been home for about 30 min. and mark still hasn't brought it up yet you know. And i got in trouble 4 not doing my laundry,b-cuz i was going 2 be nice and let my sister finish theirs before i did mine. i would call, but i don't want to get into anymore trouble, even though i wouldn't kno why i would be getting in trouble b-cuz its not like i'm grounded from the phone or ne thing i am just waiting for them to make up their mind and i don't want to do anything else to make them want to so no, yah kno? Well ne wayz i am just sorta rambling on now so i guess i'll publish this post now!! Buh Bye     I     â™¥     Matthew     &     Kevin!!!!
