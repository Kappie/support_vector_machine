I am back after a great swim during the public holidays, mayve not so great, but at least it was fulfilling... ~_^  Tuesday was a great day, apart from getting a scolding from my mother to get my butt off the bed for a morning swim. I woke up at 7.30am and we delayed and dragged until we can only leave at about 9am... *grrr* Luckily, there were not many people in the swimming complex... *phew* I hate crowds! We went to the deep pool, I have not swam in the middle and baby pool for many years, I kind of cherished the moments... The deep pool, as we know, is deep. Plus I did not touch chlorine water for at least 3 years! At  most the sea water for canoeing during camp... I TOTALLY forgotten my freestyle! I am shocked! Flabbergasted! Should I go into the water twice or once before coming out to breathe? *uurrgghh* And I could only go for 1 lap of breaststroke before my arms called help... At least I could still dived deep into the water and my brother and I dived through 3 adults 'split legs', in better English format, it is legs apart in the water. Hiaz... I better improve my swimming skill, I used to be in the advance level (not bragging but now downgrading myself -_-), now I cannot even finished 1 stupid lap. You want to hear the funny stuff? Here goes... My brother had a kind of a fit. He acted like a kid, stopping the whole family from coming up the water... And we had a so- called fight and I managed to escape. But he was strong and he must have thought I was one of his Indian or Malay friends and particularly dragged me into the water and I cannot continued anymore... It was too embarrassing, I was ducked into the water, and the next minute,  everybody  was looking at us. The old and young. And fortunately I never screamed like a girl supposed to. Anyway, I will go swimming EVERYDAY, that is a promise to slim myself down...
