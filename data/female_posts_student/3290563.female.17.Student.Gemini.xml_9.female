I still have to add a background, and make it so that it scrolls! I want my blog to be pretty, and I hope it's just that right now. Anyways, I'm dead tired. I am, so I think I'm going to head off to bed. Ok, I lied, I'm tired, but I don't want to go to sleep at the moment, I'm just done messing around with this thing for right now.  Much love
