       
      Sometimes I just wake up so happy, it's incredible. This morning, I set my alarm for 7am so I could go run before work. I woke up 15 minutes before my alarm. I lied there for 45 minute, feeling the warmth of the sun from the windows on my exposed legs and the breeze of my fan caress my face, listening to the birds sing me the song of morning and watching the white curtains of my windows dance in the wind. OH! I love the mornings sometimes.
