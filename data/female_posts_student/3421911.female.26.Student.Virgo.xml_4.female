HELLO?!) so i thought i'd talk to him about it.  just to clear the air. because i don't want people saying anything about me when i come up to him, not that what people say matters, i just don't want that in my head right now.  i'm gonna take the bar, for crying out loud, i don't need shit like that.  so we talked and he explained that he wasn't the type of guy who would spread rumors about his female friends nor would he try to hit on any of them, myself included. then he left our table with the message that we'll just be civil and that nothing of the sort can ruin our budding friendship, 'coz he is nice.  and he could be pretty useful since i need people to help me out when i review for the bar.we shook hands.  we made  beso .  i was even joking for him to give me another kiss, because i am like that.  it's how i know everything's cool.  i don't really like people to put malice in what i do to them nor do i put malice in what other people say and do to me.  i can even joke about doing it in the bathroom with a guy (or girl, as the case may be) without actually really doing it.  but then, i forgot that "this guy"  has already had a couple of beers on him.  definite no-no.  i came up to him again to ask him to light my cigarette (next time, i'll remember to  ALWAYS  bring my lighter with me) when he asked me if i was going home already, where my dorm is, who were at the dorm at that particular instance and that nobody was gonna know.  KNOW WHAT?!  then i remembered, fuck, i joked about doing it! he had his arm around me and our backs were turned against his companions and he was asking me if i wanted to do it! damnit!  NO! NO! NO! come on, he's nice, he's fairly attractive and he also said some ten, twenty minutes ago that he doesn't hit on his friends!  i could almost be his sister, for Christ's sake! well, i am his sister, sorority sister. he kissed me on the neck and his arm was around me and he kept touching my butt! i told him no, even when he kept on saying that no one would find out about it and that no, he wouldn't enjoy it 'coz i would only leave him hanging, i'm known for that and no, I DON'T WANT TO.  i flirt with everybody, i can do it(have sex) just for the sake of doing it, without commitment and without regrets.  BUT HELL, I DON'T SHIT IN MY BACKYARD.  we go to the same school, we're in the same organization and we almost have the same set of drinking buddies.  i just cleared the air because i don't need trivial issues to deal with while i'm reviewing for the bar then he gives me this?  i could call it sexual harrassment because even if i was the one who provoked him by joking about it (probably made him fantasize about me all that time i was seated away from him), he was the one who kept touching my butt when i didn't want him to.  i said no.  it could well be my fault because i shouldn't be joking around men who drank too much beer.  i don't know.  i just don't need this right now.  not ever. but it's not just my fault. he should've known better.  we were both drinking, not together, but the fact remains, we weren't totally sane about the words coming out of our mouths.  he shouldn't have assumed that just because i joked about it i would actually do it.  hello?!  NEVER ASSUME OR ELSE YOU WILL FALL FLAT ON YOUR FACE. that's how this whole "clearing the air" thing started in the first place, because of false assumptions.     people assume too much.  i can't always assume to be right 'coz most of the time i could be wrong.  people shouldn't assume.  I HAVE TO STUDY.  650 pages is a long way to go for me to wrack my brain over sex.
