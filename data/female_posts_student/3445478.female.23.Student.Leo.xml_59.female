Grandma Pam watched Nick while Shawn  I brought my car to be fixed-it's not totaled-and then we went to Target and Taco John's for "Taco Tuesday" and finally home alone. I had a blast just  being  with Shawn. He is so much fun. I love his incredibly unique sense of humor. I can't believe how much I miss him right now. He left for the cities at 5. I told myself I wouldn't cry and I felt so strong up until our good~bye hug. Nick is only 10 1/2 weeks old and he can tell Dadddy's not here. After Nick's bedtime bath usually Shawn does the last feeding in our rocking chair and I gave Nick his bath and then went to feed him in the chair and he did his heartbreaking pout and cried until I got up and feed him someplace else. I am so glad Shawn will be here on the weekends and not have to work. Only 3 more days until Shawn's home!!! YEAH!!! I can't wait. My sister Keely is spending the night here tonight and tomorrow night. I am such a big baby and scared of  every  noise so it will be such a relief to have her here.-and a great distraction, too! Tomorrow is Nick's BIG Day...SHOTS! ***Don't forget Grandma Lu***If Nick's up to it, we are going to go to Keely's soccer game.  That's about it...Shawn when you read this, I LOVE YOU!!!HAPPY ANNIVERSARY HUNNY!!!
