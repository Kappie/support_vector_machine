"chocolate chips" in all reality. Anyways..  MONDAY-  oh gawd, nervous and scared as hell outta my damn mind. I went to the hosptial at 6:30am and sat around for a good hour. My aunt Linda was there with my mom so that kinda helped, shes funny shit. Well, they finally called me back and when i was walking down the white bright lite halls i start bawling and i mean BAWLING. then i get into my lil curtain room and i change into this ooo lalala sexy gown. it was white with red and blue stars and white half moons. :p awww can i get a AMEN! lol Well...i was still crying all in fear of the shot that was going in my ass. WELL...they did it, and it didnt hurt for the record. Needles dont hurt i just panic over nuttin. but oh well, my brain is messed up. THEN, i was feelin nice after like 10mins and they took me to get my IV. Scared? oh hells yea, but i didnt cry. They numbed my hand, i didnt cry over that needle either..and then i didnt even feel the IV. Then i dont remember my mom leaving me..but i remember being in the operating room and they lifted my bed up and told me to move onto the metal table, i got half way and passed out, they shook me and told me to go some more, i passed out, it took me 3 tries to get on that metal slab of death. They put my arms out away from me and i asked if they were strapping me down, no was my answer. They then put a mask on me and told me to count backwards from 100. i said "100" and then i was out. I woke up and remember them taking the sticky things off of me (which they put on me..i do rememeber that) and taking the oxygen thing outta my nose and i said "i want my mommie" lol like some damn baby. lol And they told me i had to wake up more first. Apprently, the old lady volunteer wouldnt let my mom outta the waiting room cuz she didnt believe she was my mom. LMAO. my mom and i had diff last names. Anyways....she finally came. lol I dont remember this, but i called my doctor JESUS. of all names!! i chose jesus!! lol thank ya jesus!! anyways, i asked for a cherry limeaid and as my aunt was leaving to get it i put my hand high in the air and said NOOO I DONT WANT IT!! ..yeah...along with shaking my head around making a horse "nay". yea...
