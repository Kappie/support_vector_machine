Yesterday, we noticed a foul odor lingering in the kitchen. We snooped around the trash can for a dish of cat food that may have escaped us, but found nothing suspicious. We worried that a toad may have crawled under the stove and died of indigestion, we speculated that perhaps some large roaches had perished in the walls. It wasn't until today that I learned the terrible truth.   The smell was worse than ever. I took out a plastic bag and began loading the few items of recycling that were loitering around the garbage can. As I reached under the kitchen stool to pick up an innocent wine bottle, I realized I had hit paydirt. The green bottle lay on it's side, and as I picked it up, a putrid layer of black sludge slopped down in it. Through the dark glass, I could see wriggling. Horrified, I ran a bit of water in it to loosen the sludge, and, holding the reeking vessel at arm's length, carried it out behind the old tree and dumped it. What I found would have amazed and delighted any entymologist.   The maggots were huge and grey, wriggling and fat amidst an astounding collection of cockroach parts. There were the wings of at least a dozen full-sized tropical roaches. Presumably, they crawled into the bottle in search of the teaspoon or so of wine within, perhaps to quench a thirst induced by the poison. Perhaps there were fleeing the Sumo Toad. Twelve or fifteen of them crammed in atop each other and, unable to escape, died. All afternoon, my mother and I have been lured behind the tree by morbid fascination to peer at the squirmy pile. We can't see why the maggots haven't been eaten by the birds and praying mantis, but they have begun to change color, becoming a translucent orange. Some have already produced tiny flies, and the odor is overpowering. I have included a picture, in which you can see the maggots if you look closely. I can't begin to count the wings. Imagine, if you will, the sickening stench of rotting flesh as you examine it, for full effect.   This process has been an unusual way to overcome my fear of roaches, I must say.
