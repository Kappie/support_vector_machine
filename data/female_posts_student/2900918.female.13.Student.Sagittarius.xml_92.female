Irvin and Shiru[Zhe rui] were told to move to their seats away in English cuz they kept talking in that vacant classroom, they also moved away in the "formal" classroom. I'm not really sure if dava knows that three of us were sitting in a row in the "formal" classroom, but they moved neways.   Thus, today's my first day of isolation.  And I coloured my nails BLACK.  Pls, if u see me with BLACK nails, pls dont ask why it's black.  And Ms Soh [Guat Ee], I have NOT burnt them, thank you very much.  Answer:   I was BORED!!!   oh, special thanks to Shi Ning for givin' me the disc, I'm gonna try it out as soon as my bro comes home. I hope he knows how to work it, yes I'm one pathetic lil' ass...
