I have that special someone, I just can't be with them at the moment :( Only 20 more days...  So I'm trying to choreograph a lyrical dance to Justin Timberlake's "Never Again" it's actually a really good song, and I just really like lyrical dances and hip hop, but lryical are more emotional and they interpret alot better. I have come to really like dancing, I'm even thinking about taking some outside dance classes like ballet and modern, that should be fun. I miss swimming though, but it's just not going to fit into my schedule. Plus, dancing helps out alot in theatre. You usually have to act well, sing well, and dance well, I can act and sing, but I always was afraid to dance, now I'm not and it's really fun, so woo woo!  Valentines plan tomorrow, me and Kiera, eating chocolate and watching movies, prefreably Office Space? :)   Funny how a few words turn into sex
