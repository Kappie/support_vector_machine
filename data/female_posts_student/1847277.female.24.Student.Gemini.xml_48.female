I was told the primary reason for me to get the flu shot is basically so if I now come down with flu symptoms I have  incentive to get to a doctor because I may actually have SARS.  Great.  Just what I need.  More paranoia.   The possibility of more juggling around in my schedule has put me on edge yet again.  I think I need to work in a fairly stable country where this won't be quite so much of an issue.  I'm a psycho-freak about planning and always have been.    Damn.  I wish I had something clever and/or witty to say.  But I've got nothin.  Ah well.
