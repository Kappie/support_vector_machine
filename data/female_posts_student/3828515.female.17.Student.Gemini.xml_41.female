There were some British people sitting and talking in the park next to the courts... It was interesting to hear that type of accent in Chicagoland (Chi-CAAAAA-go-leeeeaaaaand). Crazy Illinois people. I will never conform :P! Anyways, like yesterday, I played the piano for hours on end, and I played some stuff on Xbox Live. And it turns out that I am going to Six Flags yet again tomorrow because my brother wants to go. So there. More fun for me :). And if you didn't hear about the other time I went last week or so, that was a lot of fun. I went with my church choir buddies. Andy screams like a girl! Heheh... Anyways. Right now, my mom is at a refresher class at Delnor, and she took my car :(. She called during her dinner break and told me about how she had to practice artificial respiration and CPR on a dummy. Heheheh. And my dad is in Cincinatti, Ohio, at some client's factory. I wanted to go with him and take a side trip to Paramount Kings Island, but that never happened because the "weather was supposed to be bad" :(. But since my parents aren't home, I can blare my music as loudly as I please regardless of the time >:). Well, I think that is all for now. Woo hoo! Tomorrow should be fun :). I bid you good night.     Last song I listened to:   Too Late Too Late  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Garage, Inc. .   Last meal I ate:  Spaghetti.   Last movie I watched:   Seabiscuit .   Last movie I saw in a theater:  Friggin'  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban !   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I'm wearing my Florida trip T-shirt today :).   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Somebody mentioned something about zinc oxide in sunscreen. Wow, that really took me back :P.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   The Element of One  by Killswitch Engage.   Favorite food today:  What? Julia enjoying something sweet in nature? Mmm... Peanut butter Rice Krispies treats.   Most interesting thing I did today:  I'm blaring Metallica in my room with the window wide open right now >:D. And tennis was fun.   Funniest thing that happened today:  I reminded David of his pants :). Heheh... A guy in a game I was playing kept yelling, "Gitterdone, y'all!" Oh, that was great. And some little kids attacked Melissa's car, and she bitched 'em out. That was great, too.
