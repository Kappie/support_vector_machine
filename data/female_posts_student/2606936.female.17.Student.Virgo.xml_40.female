However, it's not the gifted kids that set the school's standards.  You see, darling Bushie-Wushie decided that no child would be left behind in terms of education.   This is a nice policy, i guess. Make sure everyone is educated, blah blah blah. I mean, it was crappy when in fifth grade students couldn't even read properly bc teachers were sooooo lenient with them.  But do those of us who care about what we're doing in school, really ever need to be exposed to the mundane stuff? I mean, I would hope that having passed all my hard-ass classes I would be prepared to graduate. But no, Georgia like to do this "high school graduation test" - a big standardized test on math, soc stud, science, and LA - and if u don't pass it you don't graduate.  This is also a great idea. I totally agree with the concept.  But OH MY GOD. The things they consider testable knowledge, learned in school, at a high school level? ANd the fact that people fail this stuff? That just fills my heart with dread for the future of our great nation.  We've only had science and social studies so far, but here's some stuff i saw that was memorable. I'm typing a few from memory and a few off of a study guide i was given....  1) A chemist drops a beaker holding unknown chemicals onto the floor and it breaks. Which of the following is    NOT    part of the correct safety procedure for cleaning this up? a) Use tongs to move the glass shards. b) Wash hands after cleaning. c) Do not rinse chemicals down drain. d) Carefully pick up the glass shards with your fingers and deposit them in the nearest trash can. PROBABLY GEORGIAN ANSWER: B. We too deep for chemical burns.  2) Which of the following is    NOT    a responsibility of a U.S. citizen? a) vote in elections b) talk other people into agreeing with your point of view c) obey the law PROBABLE GEORGIAN ANSWER: A.  "Evolution: don't let it happen to you."  3) The Senate campaign in Jane's state has become very controversial. The chanllanger, John Jones, has accused the incumbent, Harry Havelock, of being unconcerned about an issue. Where should Jane go to  find out how Mr. Havelock really feels about these issues? a) the encyclopedia b) her parents c) the COngressional Record d) her social studies textbook a) vote in elections PROBABLE GEORGIAN ANSWER: B. Mostly Republican, huh?  Enh.... i don't wanna think any more.....
