I usualy dont have anything to do with the animals but since my mom is working and nobody is home all of the time but me and my sister I guess i have to pitch in. Its also like 100 degrees right now in my house and im wondering now why we dont have air conditioning. I have to go get a shot on Tuesday and im not looking forward to that, I also have to get a physical just in case anything is wrong i know about it before i leave. I think that the hardest part for me, on my trip, is that i wont be able to check my email. That is the way i communicate with all of my friends. Its going to suck but ill survive somehow!
