He was my favorite character on the show, and I really looked forward to the episodes he was in.  I miss him so much, though, the show did the very best they could in replacing him with Gary Cole, who is a wonderful actor.  I just hope they end up doing something more than they have so far with the character.  I've got my fingers crossed for this week's show, but I'm not holding out too much hope.  A once great show has proven, this season, to be a major disappointment.
