I'd rather just throw up and gfet it over with then sit there for hours wanting to throw up...ugh...I feel a little better right now but thats because I had a shower. 15 minutes of a shower in fact, I do think that is a record time for me. I am never allowed to be in that long but no one is going to be home for the rest of the day so... :) anyways....gah..I have nothing else to say. oh well.. g'day.   Goddess Bless.
