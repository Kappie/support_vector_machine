A local kid was beaten to death Saturday. That much I found out last night. His name was Jamahl Jones, and I went to school with him. That much I found out today. Last night I found out a friend of mine was having issues helping his/her friend that was a friend of Jamahl. And now, I have a friend saying that he/she thinks that she knows how the situation occured. Yea, I know it is confusing, but I want to keep actual names out of the obvious. I don't want to be the one starting rumors. Especially not on a diary. How is it that I always find things out the difficult way? In news that I will use real names in, Anthony told us last night that Jordan had been arrested. He said it was a kidnapping charge. I have more inside information that i am not at liberty to say anything about but for the time being, i can be happy. I guess some people get what they deserve while others just live tragedy that William Shakespeare wouldnt even write. Anyway, that is all for now. I might write more after work tonight
