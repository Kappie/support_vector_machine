When I said 'Melanie apparently wants me to go' (as in to Canada) I didn't mean I am only going because she wants me to - I am desperate to go. But what I meant, was that apparently as well as me wanting to go, she also actually wants me to go. Something I find hard to believe. Sorry for any confusion.  Ok today has gone totally wrong but hey. Went to bed v late last night and so slept through alarm this morning and missed meeting I was supposed to go to.  Then I found out that although I had managed to get Fairtrade orders of Â£172 yesterday, the 27 Co-op eggs which people had ordered were no longer in stock and they wouldn't be getting any more before Easter. So now I have to go back to church on Sunday without eggs and apologise to everyone and give them their money back.  I feel SO bad about this and although everyone out there will say, "but it's not your fault Karen" I feel like it is a total reflection on me.  I really wanted to encourage people to buy Fairtrade, show them how easy it was, how good it was, and everything has gone wrong.  Was I doing it for the right reasons? I guess I wanted to prove myself and thats why. Now all you lot will again be saying that this is why I need to look to God for my affirmation, not the things I do, or the things people think of me BUT ITS NOT THAT EASY.  Anyway met up with Lizzy this afternoon which was really lovely and ended up chatting for about 2 and a half hours! Told her all about being in hospital and some of the things I struggle with. Wow scary hey - she might find out about the real me!  Am going to see the Passion on saturday - might take a cushion to hide behind when it gets gruesome!
