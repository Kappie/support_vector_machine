We went downtown together on the Skip, before we parted, going our separate ways, stopping for a brief drink together at Starbucks. I cashed my paycheck and bought a hot dog. I went shopping and came home, for the rest of the day, I read for a while, my book Iceland's Bell, and came home.  I am going to a film tonight. Accidently I think. And I am trying out a retro skirt/blouse from the 70s, seeing how it works. The polyester doesn't breathe very well. Oh my.  I think I am not important, but I want to regress a little, so I am looking like a different person in a way. I am not at all put out at the concerns at Trident, but it mildews over to a point, I am often tempted by it, when I am not in the mood to drink tea at home. But there are so few students there that I am totally out of the element that I am seeking. I can't enjoy a cafe full of middle aged parents, divorcees, and teachers. I don't like it.  I am young. At least, but life moves on whether I do or not.  I just wanted to be original, not copy everyone, and I am not sure anymore what is or isn't like the trend, I just don't know enough about other people, if I did I might know what is reasonable to expect, what is reasonable to look for, and what is good enough to settle for in the way of romance. How good is good?  Goodbye.  Alisia
