What's the betting it's wrong) and all the mum's are really wise and patient. All the dad's are rash and don't back down easily. Hmmm! I'm sooo tired! We were playing rounder today and I was the last person not out. I had to run around then bat, then run around again. Aargh it was madness. Rounders is fun! Even though I hit the ball behind me it's still cool! I'm gonna go explore the web, does any one know any good webbies to visit? Bubi. :) :) :)
