Playhouse concerts with North Somerset are sooooo much more fun, cause the playhouse is HUUUUUUGE and it has loads of stairs!!! Wow. Fun. Actually everything about North Somerset Orchestra is better than School Orchestra. Its more fun, the pieces are easier, sound better, the conducters are actually better than Mr.K, you get a break when you can buy food and sweeties etc!!! And you get to meet loads of people! Its just down right cool! ("down right" where did that come from?) And Mr.K insists that school is better! Pah! (Dont tell him about this; the very mention of North Somerset Orchestra was enough to get him shouting at me!)
