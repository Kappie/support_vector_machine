The reason why? BECAUSE MY MOTHER KEEPS READING IT AND BOTHERING ME ABOUT IT. Now every time i feel like killing myself, killing everyone else, ect. I'm like "oh great and I'll have to listen to momma whine about it later".  Friday was the renaissance monologue thing. You know, i never realized what a ham i am!((caitlin, are you calling yourself fat?))((ha)). So i get up, squeeze into the iridescent blue nightmare, and have to go searching for my shoes((that are new)) in the goodwill bag((because my motherfcuker sister put them there to be mean))((and this all happened AFTER mom told her to wake me up early but she decided not to, making me extremely late))((growl)) so i finally got to school, hopped on the bus, and did my monologue for a whole bunch of kids who couldn't care less at three different schools. It was exhausting, but i still got to miss school and perform... Something i didn't even realize i liked so much.  Friday night Devon wasn't here ((w00t w00t w00t)) so i watched TV with mom and we had fun just chatting and enjoying the lack of bastardness that comes with Devon being out of the house. We also ate a really nice dinner, she had made a pork roast a few days earlier, so we cut it into slices, sauteed it in butter-garlic-lemon-thyme-olive oil, and ate it on hoagie rolls with feta cheese. It was super delicious.  Did anyone know that the guy who played Georgia in "Cold Mountain" was actually Jack White of the White Stripes? Turns out he did the majority of the songs for the soundtrack and so they gave him a part in the movie. ((go him!))  Saturday was pretty much a waste. i invited some people over for the game, made the batter for some bleu cheese popovers, and super-cleaned my room((in anticipation of my friends coming over today)). The only bad part((which was also kind of a good part)) was when Devon came home and would NOT help me clean our room, would NOT leave me alone, and would NOT even try a little bit to be even remotely nice. So because she was being more of a bitch than usual, mom screamed at her, and it made me smile.  In case you haven't noticed, i hate my sister Devon and i love whining about it.  Well now I'm here today, none of the three people i invited is coming over. But hey, it's more chicken wings for me. ((i could actually care less about the chicken wings right now, i cleaned my whole fricken room so they could call and tell me no))((i feel SO unloved!!!))  Mom is all pissed off because last night i ate some of the guacamole that was meant for today. Who cares?  I found some of my old journals((from before i had a blog)). It was really depressing, but at the same time, even though it's all about death and despair, it's quite poetic, maybe even in a good way. Perhaps I'll post some of it up here?....  Well crap, my very last hope of a friend during the game cancelled, and now i have nothing to do but sit around with these cromagnons and eat. Maybe I'll redo my template? i think it's been a month since i did it last. i think my blog has had more facelifts than Joan rivers, i saw her on the red carpet fashion thingy, and she gets scarier by the year.  ::depressed::
