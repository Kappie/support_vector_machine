I went home today by bicycle, and it tired me out (That's my excuse. What's yours?). Was lying in bed reading The Best American Essays of 2003, and now I'm tired and envious. Not a good feeling. So, in a spur-of-the-moment decision, I decided to go down to the PC room and churn out whatever I can. This is my excuse. Go figure.
