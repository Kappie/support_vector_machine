I'm not too worried about the english one.  My analytical skills are...improving? I don't know, maybe it's just me pretending that I can read.    The musical is this week.  The band improved  slightly  since friday.  At points they make me want to shoot myself.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't want it to be over.  I'm such a loser when it comes to the end of things.  I have such a hard time letting go, well...mostly with people.  It seems in most cases they disappear or we just drift apart.  I hate that.  Amber's leaving.  What am I gonna do next year? I hate always being the one left behind?  Well, I'm probably not the only one, but my mind insists on telling me that I am, which makes me feel even more alone.  If I were graduating this year I'd be a much happier person.  I would know where I was going and wouldn't have to worry about studying for SATs and ACTs and grades would be a little less bothersome.  All I use this thing for is rants...so by now, if you happen to read this, you should realize most everything I say will be a little on the negative side.   *sigh* I feel a little alone at the moment.    My parents are leaving after my performance on friday for tuscon, yay! I love the house to myself.  I think my mother's a bit worried about me killing myself, well...maybe not that extreme, but I think she's worried i'm going to slash my arms up.  I had an awkward moment with her last weekend, after seeing the recent "incidents" on my arm she insisted on talking to me, which i guess is what you can expect from any parent.  But I get the feeling that she thinks she knows exactly what it feels like because she's a therapist, but that doesn't entitle her to really understanding what it's like.  Gah, but that's over, the awkwardness has passed, and I'm ok.  I need to go to bed.  My mind is starting to get crazy and I'm going to fall over if I don't get some sleep.
