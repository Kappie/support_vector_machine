Is it knowing their favorite color, band or food in that random collection facts that now seems so middle school to me, but still seems important as though it's part of my childhood that I'm trying desperately to cling to as it's swept away?   Is it knowing how someone feels at every moment and about everything in that connection that only comes when people have known each other long enough and deep enough to know each other's darkest secrets and therefore their very souls?  Is knowing someone knowing when you're hurting them and feeling that pain rip through you, even though they've driven you to distraction, and you need the distance, but you can't bring yourself to completely sever that connection and there's always a link to that person, even though you half wish there weren't?  Is knowing someone the same as loving them? Is it like they're part of you no matter what happens and you can't help but feel incomplete when they're not around, even though you're angry at them and can't stand the thought of them?  Is knowing someone being angry at them and saying that you hate them when you don't hate them at all? Is it needing to find yourself in that deeper sense that the other person knows you in, and you can't even begin to understand?  Is knowing someone a mixture of all these things or is it none of the above? Is it something deep or that random collection of facts like knowing their birthday?  I don't know.  Faylinn
