Hope your grandfather's doing better.  You're still moving him to the place you had originally planned, right?  Hope he's all right with it now.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  Remember soup kitchen on Tuesday. Please someone come with me.  (Rosie, hint hint)  I need to know whose name(s) to put on the list by tomorrow or Sunday.  We'll need to be at BUMC at 10:45 am.
