With access to a computer (although it's a bit of a POS...). But anyway... this is just a little overview of how my week went, even though most of you know about it or where there.   Sunday:  Play practice was from 12-3:30ish, and that went ok, although Fred was there, which kinda sucked. Poor Hanlon... Anyway, then Mande and I went to Fran's. Sat in the pool for awhile, which was fun. Played with Goofy for awhile, which was just funny. Then Mande left, and I passed the time idly by unpacking my stuff, making random cards, blah blah blah... Spent the night alone in that creepy house... Fell asleep on the couch, but oh well.   Monday:  Mande came over in the morning and we hung out for awhile. We were supposed to go swimming w/ Lainie, but her mom freaked out (b/c she showered before she cleaned Nick's cage...), so she couldn't come w/ us. So Mande and I went to Taco Bell and the mall instead. That was fun too, b/c I haven't had Taco Bell in awhile, and we looked at all the fun Hello Kitty stuff at the mall. Then we went back to Fran's and played was (3 min game!), then Ken came over and we played cards some more... Then Mande went to babysit and Ken and I hung out for awhile... which didn't go very well, but oh well. Then I went to play prac., then back to Fran's. Lainie and Mande came over and we watched movies. Pookie spent the night. We stayed up until 2 talking about theimaginary rapists Leonard and Luke, bobbing for apples, and random other things..   Tuesday: (The best night of the whole week!)  Pookie and I woke up around 8:45 when Mande got there. Dropped off Lainie's van, then we went to MFR for breakfast, which was yummy :) (even though the creepy cook was flirting w/ us... EWWW!) Went to the park and played, then went to the mall. Then Lainie and Mande went home, then I went to play prac. Made lots of random phone calls in ref. to the bonfire, went to Subway to get dinner and saw Sarah, blah blah blah. Then after play prac. all the fun started. :) I went straight to Fran's. Then Mande and Max got there, and we tried to start the fire but that didn't work. Then Heathy got there, then Robert and Beth, so Robert got to fire started. We sat and made s'mores and talked, then Robert tried to throw someone in the pool and it just went from there... pretty soon everyone was in the pool w/ their clothes on, wrestling and having fun. Sam got dropped off shortly after all the pool stuff started. Then Heathy left, and we hung out in the pool a little more. By the time we were done about half the water was in the grass, and the other half was brownish and filled w/ mud, grass, etc. So we drained the rest of the water, started refilling it, and sat by the fire. Luckily I had other clothes, but everyone else had to stay wet :) Then we had marshmallow fights, then played Red Rover for awhile. Mande and Maz left around 1, and me, Beth, Sam, and Robert sat by the fire until 2ish. Then we went inside and played w/ the magnets, piano, cat, food, etc. until 2:30. Robert burned his socks in the fire then put them on... Then we drove back to Robert's house, and Beth went home to say she was 'home', then snuck back out. Then we stopped at Sam's then went to Perkins, which was really awesome. The sign in front said 'ALL U CAN EAT PUSSY $8.99 FRIDAY 4PM-10PM' I noticed it and started laughing, then pointed it out to the rest of them, and I think we laughed at it for at least 10 mins... Then we went inside and ate and made disgusting things w/ our food. Robert hit his head on the light when we were leaving... We played the crane game, and Robert and I won matching hippos. They've got some pretty damn ugly pants... Then we went to Woodman's to get a camera. Took pics of us in carts, then went back to Perkins to take pics of the sign and the love hippos. We used up all 27 pics in the 1 hour span... Muahahaha. By then it was about 5 and it was getting light out, so we went back to Fran's, talked until almost 6, then crashed until 8. Beth had to babysit, so Robert took her and Sam home, and I fell back asleep for awhile.   Wednesday: The first half of Weds is up there ^. I woke up at about 11 and just sat around idly. Watched a lot of MTV and Fuse. Cleaned up the rest of the backyard from the bonfire. Slept some more, then took a shower. Went to Dress Rehearsal, which went pretty well except for Fred. He had a script in front of him and he still missed some of Jessica's lines... idiot... Then I went back to Fran's. Mande and Ken came over. We watched TV for awhile, then Mande left, and Ken spent the night. That went horribly, but that's a whole different story and I don't want to go into it right now...  Thursday: Woke up at 8ish. Packed up all my stuff, did the dishes, cleaned things up (removed the 'unwholesome' sayings from the fridge), blah blah blah. Watched TV, ate some Ramen noodles. Left a note for Fran, put all my stuff in ny car, then went to Milton. Picked up Beth and went looking for Robert, but we couldn't find him so we called his cell. Turns out he was going camping Thurs night, so the party wasn't going to happen... GRRRRR! Beth, Sam, and I all remembered him saying that Thurs worked better for him b/c Fri night he was going camping... Oh well, it doesn't matter b/c everything's straightened out now... Then I dropped Beth off and went to play. I was surprised, b/c I wasn't really nervous at all when I did my line. I thought I would be, b/c I was alone on the stage w/ the spotlight on me, but it wasn't all that bad. My mom and grandma came to watch, and Ken and Pookie and Jen. Pookie and Mel gave me flowers :) Thanks guys!!! Then me, Heathy, Mande, and Lainie went to Perkins. Had yummy pie, then went home b/c I was tired and I wanted to wash the stage makeup off my face.   So yeah, that's how my week has gone. It's been pretty cool :) I've got the paly again tonight. Beth's gonna come watch. Then we have the party at Robert's. I might go to the cast party for a little bit, but I'm not really sure. I'm not even sure how I'm going to make it to Milton on time tonight b/c my 'wonderful' mother failed to leave me any gas money. She won't be home until prob almost 5:30, then I still have to go to the gas station, pick up Beth, and get to school but 5:45. I don't think I'll make it to Milton on the gas that I have, and I have enough $ for one gallon, which isn't going to help all that much. Grrrr..... Idk, I'll figure things out later.
