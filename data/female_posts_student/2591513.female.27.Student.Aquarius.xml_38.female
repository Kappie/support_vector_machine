Life is difficult, full of twists and turns.  I know I have had my share, gosh at this point I am probably getting dizzy from all the twists and turns on the road I have chosen...but it doesn't kill you.  I think I have to remember that.  I won't die.  i can do this and get through.  The headaches aren't too bad.  But they are still there...I limit my vicodine intake.  I don't want to rely on those for the rest of my life.  UGH  So I try and ride it out and do other things.    Take care everyone and a very good nite to all.
