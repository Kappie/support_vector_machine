My butt was all wet and same with my top.She wet cristine then i ran to the house and wet denise soooo bad =D We then stood in the sun for like 2 mins and we were dried off (Kind od weird since we were SO wet) We went back inside and we are just cooling off right now with the fan on.Wow, today has been a sure drag untill now! Its weird! Its like one day its icy cold and the next its boiling! (Im talking about my connection withmy cousin) Its odd but its getting better.Were going to draw after this (We are drawing fans! And we dont suck either =D) But ya, just wanted to inform you on the crazy water fight =D
