Just got done with a round morning pages on the back deck and straighten..er, I mean, doing some light cleaning before Mom gets home.  I inherited her eye for clutter.  I can't have it.  So, I made my way from room to room, organizing this, folding that; I even scrubbed down the countertops in the kitchen.  Wonder if she'll notice.  She called while I was on the phone with Lorraine to let me know I have a dentist appointment tomorrow, even though I've outgrown their insurance, to deal with my gingivitis.  Whatever.  I flossed and brushed my teeth twice this morning; that'll fix it all.    Getting excited for the Bozeman trip.  It will be nice to lounge around with the Boy and our books.  They're like kids, really, except they don't pee their pants or have pork product issues.  Then before we know it, the parents and I will be making our way to the Oregon coast for a couple of days.  Yay.  Actually feeling better about that than during the last few days.  Getting my strength back and all.  Ready to deal with any shenanigans or goings-on.  And then it'll be time to trudge back up north for a month of normalcy before the whirlwind of second year begins.  Lorrainey may or may not be up for a visit, which should be good for a story or made-for-TV-special.  It's been a year since the last get-together and even though I realize I'm probably too excited (read: attached) than is good for me, I'll be okay with whatever happens.    I miss my peeps.  It's nice to be in a place where everything's taken care of for me and all I have to decide is which movie to see or pair of shoes to pick out (got a couple new pair yesterday, score), but I'm getting ready to be back in my cozy apartment.  Got a good fortune at lunch yesterday.  "You have found good company--enjoy."    Mom, of course, took it to mean her.    I said, "I like to think it means my new gang."    "Huh?" she scoffed.    "My law school friends.  My peeps."    "What does that stand for?" she said, thinking it was an acronym.
