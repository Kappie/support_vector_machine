That place, it sucks your brain clean out of your ear and makes you part of it if you're not careful.  I was one of the fortunate ones who got out and lived to tell about it.  Honestly, as I spent the evening doing pre-counts and re-counts amidst the incessant beeps and buzzes of the audit machines that surrounded me, it all came back.  See, in order to be a successful and efficient counter, part of you has to disconnect.  Certain areas of your brain just shut down - suddenly it's just your eyes, your fingers, and the merchandise in front of you as the numbers roll along in your head as if on a mental odometer.  It basically shuts down a good portion of your ability to function as a human being, and increases exponentially your ability to function as an abacus.  If you've never done it and felt it, then my words probably don't begin to explain the phenomenon.  But, trust me, once you do it and are conscious of what is taking place, it freaks you out.  On a lighter note, I have a bit of a tradition called Quotes of the Week.  I just know too many people who are constantly saying hilarious stuff, and so I feel the need to recap the cream of the crop at the end of each week and share it with those who may have missed out the first time around.  And now, it's time to share it with any and all potential blog perusers.  Here goes:  Quotes of the Week:  "Did a guy ever say to you, 'I'll make an honest woman out of you?'  Just wondering."                                   --Katrina, inquiring about Erica's college days  "I'm so excited I could shit myself!"                               --Jen, upon hearing about "I Love the '90s"  "I do enjoy the woody goodness every now and then."                                                --Jaymie  Conversation of the Week:  Matt: "Were you drinking wine tonight?" Me:   "Yeah, I broiled some salmon, had a baked potato, green beans, and some        white wine to go with it." Matt: "Aww, you had a nice romantic dinner with yourself." Me:   "Yep.  And then I masturbated."  And there you have it.  A tiny window into the kaleidoscope of weirdness that makes up an average week.  Some people have told me I'm living in a sitcom.  To that I say, get me some canned laughter, a catchy theme song, and a sucker of a network executive to push a 7-figure contract in front of me, and I'm all over it.
