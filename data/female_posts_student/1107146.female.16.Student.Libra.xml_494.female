Except it smells like popcorn in there constantly, and fresh popcorn is a really frickin' cool smell.  It'd be nice if our school could have more of the commodities that MLK has, like popcorn machines and junk. Altho ours looks a lot less evil, almost bleach white in comparison.  Speaking of...I wanted to post my "Truants in the Hands of an Angry Principal" lecture, and see the rest of y'alls too, this being a gathering of the most diabolical minds in all of the English classes, I would reckon. So, here goes...  "How is it that my untamed wrath could ever be questioned Behold!, I am the scourge of your kind, and you are but fodder for the machine of my dominion, the harvest of my malice, and the beacon to my hate. Your furthered existence within these halls is naught but a testament of my mercy, yea! I hold your souls from that precarious edge of expulsion as a debt to the gods of patience. But, weary my arm but a trifle, that closed protal that saves you from the perdition of exile and shame, and lo, shall I drop you and invite such demons of failure to feast upon your paltry, blighted souls. Think you, your purpose here, be it one of choice? Nay! Your time in my realm has been forced upon me, and may I be smote by the fury of the cruelest stuff of creatoin if I do not maintain the mask of my authority! It has been written: no flesh, no excuse, no thing of man or nature born may save you from the blood-blackened blades of my endless power, nor shall they lesssen the price of your sins. Hear my words! I am Logosian, I am both North and South, yea East and West, and every step erstwhere, I am your redepmtion and your executioner, I am the silent imminent in every conversation, every echo and bump when you may earnestly believe your solitude secure. And above all, my thirst for the flaying of young fleshes has yet to be quenched. Behold!, I am Principal Harshwords, demigod in my own accord, above all with the iron gauntlet of my reign bearing the contract of your soul tight within. Hence, let no man step forward, or may he ever be contained in the crucible (bonus points!) of my fury, ever a depiction of the eternal advent of my anger."  I thought it sounded rather dumb so I wanted some suggestions, if anyone would care to give them, and I want to read y'alls too so gimmie.
