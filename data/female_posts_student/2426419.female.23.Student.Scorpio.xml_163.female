There were a couple of hours learning about the culture, which was cool, then we went to Don Pablo's to eat and salsa dance until about 1 a.m. I could have danced longer into the morning, but Stacey wanted to get home to see her hubby. I love to dance more than anything. I'm not really sure how I look swinging my hips and moving my feet around on the floor, but I like the way it feels, the maracas swimming around in my stomach.   After we dropped Stacey off at home, Jaci and I banged on the door of The  Well. There had been a concert there that had probably ended about a hour earlier, but we saw the light in the back room, so we knew that a few of the guys were fooling around on the instruments.   They let us in and we hung out on the couches for awhile, listening to them, then I got up to the mic to make up words to the random songs they were playing. I wasn't very good, and I mainly mentioned the walls and a cross in my soul made up of fruit and gold. Jaci and I played that game where you have to sing lines from Top 40 songs, making up our own rules, of course.   I went straight to bed at 3 a.m., and now look how I am awake once again. Showered hair and I just had some peach yogurt and soymilk.   But anyway, people are all going to some town way out to have dinner tonight. I don't know if I'll go, even though it seems like it would be fun. Maybe I'll just hang out with Mom today, go to Edmond, and check out some antique shops, see what time I get back.
