I am going away to the  Canarie Islands  (One called something like Furtaventura) with the rest of my family, so there will not be any posts for a week...But I will write down what happened each day and then when I get back type it up on here so you know what's going on.        Soooo today I will be doing mostly packing and stuff, but inbetween that,I hope to get a chat with  Kat  before I leave as she will be arriving here while I am on holiday. Damn I wanted to be here when she arrived, and even meet here with a hug when she came through the arrivals terminal at the airport. I will be thinking of here alot this week, more than usual, and thats a lot!        This morning it was quite odd as I awoke from a dream, I'm sure it was about her, but I can't remember, and she was the first thing on my mind, and she is normally the last thing on my mind before I goto sleep. Yes, go on, you can say it, I am obsesed with the girl. haha. I'll get back to you later. Bye!
