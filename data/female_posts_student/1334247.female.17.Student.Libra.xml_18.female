A friend of mine is back from Colorado. He's only back for a week though. But, I got to hang out with him on Wednesday. It was really nice to see him again. He's leaving tomorrow though, so I probably won't see him again until summer...and then he's back for senior year. yay! Swing show tickets go on sale Monday. I still have to perform my song to Mr. Weinrich, and I haven't practiced it in a long time, so I hope I don't screw up too much. I'm really looking forward to swing show though. It's going to be great.
