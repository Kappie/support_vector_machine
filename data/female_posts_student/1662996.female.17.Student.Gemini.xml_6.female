However, i must speak with the authority figures on the subject because technically this ISNT my house... derp.    Tomorrow is mom's day (and MY mom's birthday... how cool is that) so heres my plan for tomorrow: wake up early, go to McDonalds and get Ryan some chow for breakfast, grab my mom some flowers and a card on the way home and continue the mothers day festivities. Then homework for the rest of the freakin day. i have a ton!   but anyway. hoes need their sleep. peace!   ryan = thaumaturgic [::dreams of you::]   night all ::hugs for all and a kiss for ryan::   $ kuff dawg $
