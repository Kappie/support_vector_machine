I just need to meet new people, see new faces, and most of all just get away from all of my problems here. I'm thinking Europe. Maybe Rome, Paris, London, Sicily, Dublin, Berlin, somewhere in Finland and probally one more place in Germany, and more places. Mostly I want to go to Ireland. If anyone would like to go with me, it is going to be as cheap as possible and I welcome company. Leave a comment in the comment section if you want to go. My plans aren't final but this is what I really want to do.
