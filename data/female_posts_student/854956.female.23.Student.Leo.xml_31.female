My biology 2 final was really not bad, of course that may be in part to my studying for 2 days!  :-)  Tuesday I had my World Civ final, and I must admit, I was really very scared about taking a blue book exam for a final.  It was so much easier than I thought it'd be.  My essay ended up being about 3 1/2 pages long.  The identifications part wasn't bad either.  When I turned in my blue book I also got to find how I did on my paper.  I got a B+... pretty good, considering I seriously thought I'd get a C-.  :-)  I didn't really read the book till the week it was due... and I didn't type it out or put anything thought into it REALLY until about 11am the day it was due.  And I had to have it turned in by 5pm.  hehe  I'm so bad.  If I would've put more effort into it, I would've pulled off an A+... which is the norm for my papers.  I love writing... but only about things I like... and I can openly admit I don't like history... let alone the comparisons on the Crusades and Jihad.  BLAH!  Anyway, the last final I had was this morning at 7:30am.  ACK!  I hate early finals... but, I think I did okay.  Not my best, mind you, because I was really not as prepared as I should have been... but I sorta burned out... I just kinda knew that I didn't have enough time to REALLY learn some of the concepts... well... not learn... to keep them straight... Anyhow, so I just sorta said, "This is how it is..." and finally went to bed, because it would've done me less good to stay up all night studying.  Anyhow, I'd say I knew about 80% of the exam.  Which is about how I did on the other 3 exams.  So, with luck, I'll pull of a B in that class... if not, then I'll settle for a C.  He was a difficult, but AWESOME professor!  The only good thing about waking up so FRIGGIN' early, and being at school to take a final that FRIGGIN' early, was getting to see and chat with Mike.    Check this out!!!  Last Weds. morning (last day of Psych class) I was sitting on the bench outside of the lecture hall.  I was sleepy, so I decided to let myself doze for a bit (I had an hour).  There was this guy sitting next to me on the bench, and he was reading some intellectual magazine (like I think it was a modern sociology mag or something of that nature... didn't pay TOO much attention to it).  So, I curl up, and I was sitting sideways on the bench (the back of the bench was on my right side...) I had my knees up (so I was curled up) and I used my red hoody jacket as a blanket and leaned my head on the back of the bench (on my right).  So, I dozed off, and having no perception of how much time had passed I decided I should survey the area and see how many people had showed up for class (more people, less time till class started)... anyhow, about 20 feet away, standing along the outside wall of the lecture hall is Mike... looking dead straight at me... staring... when I noticed... he tried to play it off, and sorta looked away, but kept looking back.  It sorta weirded me out... I'm not used to people WATCHING me sleep.  Anyhow, there were only a few people there, so I laid my head back down and dozed off again...  now... this next time I came to, I again opened my eyes to see how many people were out there now... and I almost peed on myself... because no longer was "modern sociology" guy there... but Mike was sitting RIGHT next to me, and watching me sleep... I was sorta taken aback... but, then he sorta just smiled at me, and asked, "Did I scare you?"  And I said, "Sorta... being that when I saw you before you were about 20 feet away... and now you're 2 feet away... and I didn't even hear that other guy leave... or you come sit here in his place...."  OY!  Then I couldn't close my eyes anymore... I just couldn't.  I was too freaked out that he would watch me... and he STILL kept looking over at me... like I couldn't see him... and he'd get this gleeful smirk on his face... then he'd sorta look away... one of the last times he looked at me like that, I looked right at him... and I asked... "what, silly?"  and he made some comment about how he was "taking in the moment"  it was so odd... he also kept doing miscellaneous things to like, try to keep him busy... and he at one point had a piece of paper and a pen... which I have NO IDEA why he got it out...  I don't KNOW about this guy... he seems so odd... but it intrigues me BEYOND belief.... I also was talking to a girl that sits in front of me in Psych, and she frequented SI sessions and got to know Mike a little better than me... and anyhow, she was saying she felt bad for him, because she didn't think he was with any family or anything for Thanksgiving... apparently he's adopted, or something... and I didn't quite understand... she was being very vague, I think she started feeling bad about talking about him... but I think he knows his birth family... and he wasn't able to be with EITHER family (adopted or birth).... so sad... Anyway... that's what's happened since last week...  Comment if you must...       urlLink  postCount('11Dec2002');
