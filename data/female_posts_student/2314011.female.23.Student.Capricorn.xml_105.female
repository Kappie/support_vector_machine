It was remarkably different from today thus far.  There's no snow, my hair is still long from the winter and it's a bit overcast.  I'm immersed in a new writing assignment I find myself getting more excited about by the day, and don't plan on leaving the Grind or my homework until 7.  Then I might go home and watch a couple of discs of QAF Season 2.    We love circles.  The story's published in the law school newsletter today and I've already received my first piece positive feedback.  "God loves you, hon." was the last line of the note and it reminded me of my landlord's wife's reaction to the news:  "God will get them in the end."  It may have been a different sentiment if I'd explained my theory about why the attack took place, but it was sweet, nonetheless.  So it seems the most important bits of that day and that time have stuck around:  the friends, family, car, the smile, laugh, and Queer Debbie with her brownies; while the hardest to let go of bits have managed to fade away:  the worry, anxiety, fear and suspicion.
