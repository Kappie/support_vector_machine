The group was impressed with what I came up with; a full 11 pages of Anger Management and now they want me to do Stress Management which was of course, not of my responsibility.... WTF THEY THINK I AM! CBCBCBCBCBBCBCBCBC!!! 5 people in a group and 2 did nothing as 1 is a fucking Malay girl and the other is a Chinese from China! The other 2 are my beloved Brother Liang and Sister Amelia who are busy with their Stress Management! They kinda lost their way in this project as they had been doing it constantly over the weekend but still not out with any shit… As for me, 11 pages of Anger Management in 1 day and best of all, everyone in the group sang praises… HOW PROUD AM I! KAKAKKAKAKAKAK!!!!    Oh well, lets talk about everything a little here and there. On Thursday night last week, I went to Mount Faber with Von and Laura. It was very nice to be able to just get out and relaxed at a place that you fancy. I was happy that we could once again indulged in the beautiful atmosphere and the freshest air perhaps. Not so true though as I stayed beside the hill and the trees on the hill give the freshest air every morning… HURHUR! That night I recalled a lot of things, sweet memories and such. When I was still in Secondary 3, Von, Suelyn and me always go to the airport every now and then. Those were one of the most fun days. Always buy blueberry ice cream from Swensens and eat happily! HURHUR! After Mount Faber we went to West Coast Mc Donald’s drive thru and bought some nuggets and fries. Yummy! On the way home, we dropped by the petrol kiosk and I bought a tub of Swensens’ Ice cream for Von and Laura. Hope they like it.    On Friday, I went to school as usual and after school, my group was supposed to stay back and plan for our projects. We booked a room in the library and discussed about how we should go about with the Anger and Stress Management thingy. Brother Liang and Sister Amelia went to another room and continue with their Stress Management leaving the rest of the group and me in the first room. I couldn’t work with that stupid Malay girl, as she is too assertive and she is one who talk the most, disagree the most and yet, did nothing for the group so far. WTF! MALAYS ARE MALAYS! I give up on them…. Jing Jing the Chinese girl aren’t so bad as she still does her research and her part but still I decided to do the whole part MYSELF! I can’t work like this, I prefer working alone as working in a group is time wasting and when our ideas don’t match, there are bound to be clashes. SICK OF THESE SHITS!    We had team building to do after the project discussion and everyone are supposed to stay for dinner, somewhere some place. Jing Jing did mention she couldn’t make it for dinner but would stay for a drink a day before. When the clock strike 5.30pm, Siti came into the room and said her mum need her back home… WTF AGAIN! Always full of craps and excuses… She left with Jing Jing and I was like DUHZ. I joined Brother Liang and Sister Amelia in their room and continue reading my part on Anger Management. While doing our stuffs, we chatted a little and suggested going Geylang for Tou Huay! They were brainstorming and I gave them a lot of my ideas. Well, shocked to see that they actually did use my ideas as part of their part on Stress Management. We left at 6.30 as the Library was closing. Brother Liang agreed to get us to Geylang! So happy, we hopped on his car, a Toyota Corolla and went on the road but to our dismay, traffic was really bad and we were stuck on the road for almost 1 hr. Reached Geylang only at 7.30pm and were busy looking for a parking lot. Lucky we found a lot soon and proceed to Yong He Dou Jiang for our dinner! YUMMY AGAIN! Left Geylang at around 9pm and reached home around 9.45pm. So shagged man!    On Saturday, I woke up feel tired and sianz as I have to get started and do my project. I had breakfast and was watching TV in the living room when I suddenly had the urge to play game so I went ahead. HURHUR! I miss playing games as I basically had lesser time to do so now… Haiz… I got mad at Darling in the game because he said, “Lets mate” when he landed need me. I was furious to be exact, the word mate reminds me of him and Amy. PUI! That whore! Anyway, I was sarcastic and said, mating is for you and your exgf. Well, she did once asked him, “No love can make love meh?” and the answer given to her make her tear like shit. Yes, man has needs! When she asked that question, I insisted that darling should answer what I had told him, “It’s not making love, its merely fucking or perhaps, having sex!” Of course he did not said that lah… KAKAKAKKAKA! AM I EVIL?    Min called me around 7pm and she was crying then. She asked if she could come over to my house now and I said okie. What else? Must be that stupid boyfriend of hers… Always break her heart in some ways… Guys are simply insensitive horny creatures! Can’t he understand or at least appreciate what was being cooked for him… Still wanna be so choosy, might as well go restaurant lah. We went for movies since both of us are not really happy. Caught Mean Girls at Westmall. Nice show though, worth the weekend charges I supposed. While at the movie, darling SMS me couple of times telling me he is going drinking with his friends. I was not very happy with his decision to go drinking, as he is not a good drinker and seldom drink but why now? Well, anyway, he assured me he would be fined and will not get himself drunk or so as he is a back up driver in his gang of friends. I reached home at around 11.30pm and bathed. That night, I chatted with Shamus until I think we should talk over the phone. He called me and we started talking. I wept a little as he was saying; he said he would never stop loving me… I was very touched. I intended to wait for Darling to get home and speak with him but because I was too tired, I fell asleep without realizing.    On Sunday, I woke up did the usual stuffs and got online to play some games. Darling called me when he woke up and I was delighted because I did not get to speak with him the previous night. I played game with Darling and it was fun because it had been a long time since we can really play for so long. KAKAKAKK! Darling is lucky as he doesn’t need to work as he was given his day off. Nice! Actually, I can’t recall much of Sunday except that Von is not feeling well and does not wanna go out. Hurhur! That’s all for Sunday. Anyway, I was supposed to be doing my project but I am so lazy and decided not to go school on Monday so I could stay at home and finish up my part on Anger Management. Brother Liang and Sister Amelia have been working hard on their part man. They went out on Saturday and Sunday to do Stress Management…. POOR THINGS!    On Monday, which is yesterday, I woke up feeling lethargic and refused to go to school. Well, second week of school and I am playing stunt liao! KAKAKKAKAKAK! My fucking conduct is always D or E because of my attendance. I got counselled twice during my diploma time because I always absence myself and did not produce any MC. WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL MAN! I am a genius! Like I always believe, sleep in class and talk in class did not prevent me from scoring well. Well, so why bother going to school… PUI! ARROGANCE? SO BE IT! MY LIFE! KAKAKAKAKAKKAKAK!    I played game in the morning and early afternoon. Was still trying to get into the mood of working on my project man. Anyway, my fucking pc got infected with virus because I downloaded some shit the previous night… I was panicky like hell, as my pc cannot fail me at this time… I need to work man! I scanned a lot of times and found the sources of the virus then I deleted the virus and restart my pc immediately as I was told in the past, always restart your pc to prevent the deleted virus from infecting again. When I switched on my pc, I was damn shocked and surprised because I just couldn’t get online at all… OMG!!! DID I DELETE SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS ME FROM GETTING ONLINE???? I was furious and worried at the same time… I off and on the fucking pc again and this time round it works… LUCKY! Since the pc is kinda down with flu, so I decided to do my work liao… Cannot wait till it really shut me off then I wanna do…    I started brainstorming and writing down points. I read and go through all the articles that we have got and also surfed for a lot of things to do with Anger. Finally I got started and was really stressed as I am somewhat lost… I took some time off and smoked a lot… I was trying hard to relieve my tension. I got back and did my very last touch up and at 11pm sharp, I am done with 11 pages. Satisfied and happy, I called Sister Amelia telling her I’d send her my part now but she said her printer has no more ink so I sent to Brother Liang instead. Darling was on night shift and while doing my project, I keep thinking of Darling. He was always on my mind constantly and I start to believe, when you are lost, you’d think of the person you love a lot. TRUE! I waited for darling to call but fell asleep at 3am, as I was too tired le. Woke up at 5 plus and was wondering if I should give darling a call but thinking he could be resting already so I decided not to call him lah.    Today, I woke up at 9am. I called darling and he told me he was very tired because last night he went after some ah bengs who chopped another ah beng with parang! So scary! He describes the scenario to me and I was like, KAOZ! SO DANGEROUS! Hiak! Anyway, I went back to sleep and woke up at 11am. Speak with darling a little and went to prepare myself for school. I decided to put on make up today, as there was a big big mole look-alike on my chin… SIMI SAI! KAOZ! I did not use any concealor but merely power and blusher. As for the fucking mole look-alike, I apply a bit of concealor to make it look lighter… HAIZ… FUCKING FAT AND UGLY! I FEEL LIKE DYING! I put on my skirt and was surprised it kinda loosen up… I think I was too stressed last night, I puked my dinner and that’s why today my skirt so loose… I had a bit of lunch and got outta house at 12.45pm, the fucking cabby took me the long way today and when I reached school, it was 6 bucks! 2 bucks more than usual!    School was as usual, Min did not come to school today as she was having her menses… It was so boring without her because she is the person sitting beside me everyday, entertaining me! Haiz… *was watching the HAI YOU MING TIAN now and saw that guy who looked like Chris… Haiz… * My project was appreciated by the group so I was pretty happy. HeeeEeeeeeEeEe! At 2 plus, I received a SMS from darling and was shocked he is not sleeping. I called him and he sounded rather disturbed and anxious. He asked if I’d be going out after school with a female classmate or so and demanded an honest answer. I said no as I intend to go home ma and he let out a ‘hah’ tone telling me he felt better after hearing my answer. I was told he dreamt something bad happened to me and he don’t want me to go anywhere except home. I said okie, I’ll go straight home so don’t worry and we hang up. He SMS me couple of minutes later and see below.    “darling… pls be extremely careful out there… I can’t live without u ok?? My tears juz rolled out when I got shocked awake by the nitemare… so pls be super careful.”    AhhHHhhHhhHhh… So sweet… He is really a darling, my dai sek! I was shocked when Joscelin asked me to go collect our books after school… I showed her the SMS and she said, “then ni hui jia loh”. I was thinking, actually go take book nothing will happen one lah so I did went after school. Jos said how zhun can it be man, it’s only a dream but I told her, “you are wrong man, I woke up last night at 5 plus without knowing why and when darling told me he went after those parang bengs at 5 plus too…” See what I mean? When two people are in love, you get extremely sensitive about their well-being and all. Even sleeping can wake up and I must say that this is not the first time man.    Got home feeling wonderful. Today seems like a fine day for me except that those cabbies I met today all trying to take me the long way… SIMI SAI! Haiz… I miss Von and Veili… I miss Velong and all their names started with V! KAKAKAKKAKAKK! That’s all for today man… Having backaches now… Tall people get backaches easily okie. I wanna include Chris pic for u guys to see. Hurhur!     urlLink    Chris~   Kisskiss!
