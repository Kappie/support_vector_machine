Never thought I'd start a blog...see, it's all because of you Wanniehead...you keep bugging me like mad until I can't stand it anymore...grr...well, if I don't like it I can just abaikan it lolz :P Anyway it's Friday and it's holiday time!!! Yay!!! :D But (sigh) I still hafta study cuz exams are very near...this near...the Japanese girls from Fukuoka(that right?) have gone back...when it was recess there was like a huge crowd cuz the 5 girls were clad in kimonos and our girls were like mad, taking pictures like there was no tomorrow lolz :) nice view from my recess spot actually...it was like a celebrity had come to our school! Why trouble yourself when you could just order a pic of all 5 of them in kimonos for a buck from the P  J Club? Of course, your face wouldn't be there...Yaso my dear friend was busy wrapping gifts for Sakiko, mind you, there're loads of gifts...postcards, a bracelet, a card, a shirt, and pics! She even wore her um...special contact lens just to take a pic with them :D Anyways gtg watch the Olympics...love the Equestrian sports!
