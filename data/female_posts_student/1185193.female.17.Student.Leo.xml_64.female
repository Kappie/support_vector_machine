I was going to tell you about how on Sunday, between dancing at the 8:30 and 10am, I spilt hot chocolate on my white dancing outfit and drove 55 mph back to church cursing until I got Amanda to change clothes with me because she was only going to dance at the 8:30, but I decided it wasn't worth it because you all already know what a clumsy dancer I am.  I like going out to eat at restaurants by myself.  About 2 months ago, I would never have entertained the idea for fear of people chanting and gesturing "welcome to Loser-Loner Land population 1, YOU."  Remember that from grade school?  But I've now concluded that I honestly don't care.  In fact, I find it comforting dining alone.  And I don't feel stupid or out of place whatsoever.  I went to The Elepahant Bar for lunch today and got the crispy chicken tenders platter.  Sometimes I just have an intense craving for the juicy chicken dipped in mouth-watering honey mustard sauce.  So I decided to cowtow to my penchants (hehe, that's a fun sentence to throw at a dense person!).  I just dislike when I go up to the hostess (no, not the cupcake) and she asks if I am meeting someone.  What, just because she doesn't have the audacity to dine by herself doesn't make it wrong for the rest of us confident go-getters.  I feel nauseous when people are "afraid" to do things on their.  Sometimes--only occasionally--will I have a speck of  compassion for someone like that because I was once like them.  For a paradigm (can you tell we are in the "p" section of our vocab books in school?), David and I will be sitting in the cafeteria, and he is afraid to walk 10 feet to go buy food because he is terrified of being seen alone.  What a loser!  He is so unconfident.  I used to have compassion for him in those situations, but now I'm just fed up.  I have decided to not feed his insecurities by walking with him to get food; after all, he's a big boy, he can do it!  At this point in the story, my dad would say to me again, "Megan, you're going to have boys," which infuriates me so much.  He says this because he thinks I am a tough drill lieutenant.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with boys, especially Alexander Knapen, whose perpetual cuteness will turn into being a hot teenager someday.  Not that I care if someday my children mature from cute to hot.  But I can always tell with little boys if they will be hot when they are older.  Sadly, most of them will not be because of unattractive parents who should have never procreated in the first place.  I plan to be one of those attractive women who marries the opulent, dashing gentlemen.  And if I don't turn out good, and least my well-endowed husband can fertilize me with his above-average sperm.  Oh my, see what happens when I let my boundless imagination run wild?  So, in conclusion, I deliver some words of advice to everyone:  You are not the center of the universe and no one will think twice about you eating alone because they are too self-involved with searching for their own Midas/millionaire mujer and figuring out their own lives, so grow some confidence and get out there!
