I'm listening to Gary Beals on the radio.LOLOLOLOL it's actually an ok song. ~~Summer days are made for people in love, summer nights are made for lovers!~~ *dances*   erm...that never happened. Look away.  SO today I hung out at home and was bored. I joined Habbo Hotel. http://habbo.ca  fucking join you fucking fucks. Sam's all addicted to it. I'm still a little intimidated though. I can feel an e-obsession coming on...OH NO SWIM AWAY, SWIM AWAY! I've also been more active on E-SPIN THE BOTTLE http://www.e-spinthebottle.com/ I met 2 guys by sending them notes. They're cool but I don't talk to them much. The only person to send me a note so far was a girl so I think I better edit my profile...it's swinging a little too far to the lesbian side of things. I went on a BOOK ADVENTURE! It was not as awesome as it appeared before I left though. First I found 24 Woozles book cards, that's 10 dollars off a book. They went back to 1997. Fucking rock on. I found a $20 bill and lot's of change and my Library card. OFF I WAS ON MY ADVENTURE. BUT while walking downtown I got weird looks from people and I started to feel sad. At Woozles I bought "Princess in pink" 5th book of the Princess Diaries series. I didn't go to the library in the end, and I also didn't go to Subway like I had planned. I did go to the Big G, but Fred wasn't there ;_; Then while walking up my street I saw Jordan and I think he said Hi *confused face* but I wasn't really paying attention so now I'LL ALWAYS WONDER. geez. Ok then some stuff happened and cue the evening it's dark out and I was lying on my deck on a beach towel and couch pillows reading my book. What a load of crap. The series went so far down hill I think I'll vomit. So far I've read 20 pages (it's hard to read fast when the book sucks) and it was all Mia whining that her boyfriend hasn't asked her to Prom. SO GIRLY AND GROSS AND EEWWWWWW. Fuck you Meg Cabot for abusing the knowledge that people will buy whatever crap you stuff into this series. The 3rd book should have finished it, but nooooo, you had to keep milking this money cow. Now there's a second movie. IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME STORY. Everyone's only going to see it for Julie Andrews actually singing a song. BUT BUT BUT YOU HAD TO RUIN THAT BY HAVE RAVEN SING WITH HER. Fuck. You really are a retard. I am so angry. >:(    That prom stuff set off another rant. I don't have a boyfriend, and I never did have one since I was 12 so maybe I just don't know how things work. But it seems to me if you're going out with someone it should be a given that you go to dances together. You shouldnt have to be shy and whatever anymore. You know they like you back, they are your BOYFRIEND for crying outloud. What the hell am I missing here? This must be why no one likes me, I'm not a freakin idiot...geez.  I'm still really angry for not really good reasons.  oh how I love my bloggy :)  OH OH you see how it says "look away" up there? well I just read that and remembered where I got it. OH MY GOD i love those beer commercials!!  ~often I've dreamed of standing at a lake of beer...but not like this, never like this  ~*sings*I'VE GOT A DATE ON SATURDAY ~What do you get when you cross a beer drinker with a hand talker? ^__^   I dunno...   A spilly talker >:( Dumping the pride of nova scotia (and so on) yay beer commercials yay. I must be the only person ever to love those. I don't even drink beer.  On the subject of commercials, I freakin love the White Point commercials. You know? "Rush hour, at white point" and they show something not rushed at all. I only love the Sand Piper one. All the little birdies go running from the water and ITS SO ADORABLE! deedlydee deedlydee deedlydee (this is birdies running noise) GO BIRDIES GO!!  wow I can just go on and on and on can't I?  It's really fun for me. I dont know why. Well readers who dont exsist, I hope you liked it!
