I spent 2 and half hour ont he Navigational Bridge this morning with about 20 VIP guests. It was so neat to stand there on the bridge with the Captain, Staff Captain, Safety Officer and the pilot and watch as we sailed trhough HUGE chunks of ice into the Glacier area.  I took a ton of photos so everyone will be witness that we were there. It was neat, very neat.   It's very cold in Alaska right now (obviously) but apparently this is nothing compared to the deadpan winters the locals experience. Nonetheless, it's a helluva lot colder than Mexico was two weeks ago.  I must say, I miss my little haunts in Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta  Ixtapa.  i wonder how my friend Elias is?!?! I should email him. Mental note just made.  So, everyone is clearing out of here like crazy.  The Chief Engineer is leaving on the 17th and then my favorite chief engineer is comnig back - Baltsavias.  He's so freaking awesome. My little Safety Officer just got back onboard. I sat with him in Disco last night for a few hours - I, of course, being the lush that I am, had about 3 CC's and sprite to his 1.  Hahaha, anyway, he was laughing at me because when i first got onboard I got toasted in the crew bar. He had to walk me back to my cabin as I kept banging into doors and falling over. Not a pretty sight at any rate. At least he has a good since of humor about it, I suppose. The program coordinator, Gina is leaving in Juneau tomorrow. I will miss her. Then a lot of us leave on the 29th.  A whoel new batch of people will arrive. I just can't wait to see my replacement - whew! I will then just hand over the pager, mobile phone handover notes and get her a uniform. I have already decided I am not working after she gets onboard. I can't wait!  17 days and counting. Everyone wish Jennifer a safe trip to Cambodia.
