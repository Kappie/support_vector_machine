It is going to be a day filled with trying to get as much reading for the week done as possible, so there will not be much time for anything else, such as finding fascinating things out there on the web or sharing my deepest and scariest thoughts with you.  Perhaps, if I have a really early and productive day, I will be back in the evening in all my splendid glory.  But I'll probably be too tired and cross-eyed from all the reading to think, let alone post.  But we shall see...Until then, a little quote from the Good Book to help remind us (meaning myself) of the task at hand:  Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth - Proverbs, 27:1
