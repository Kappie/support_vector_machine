Yeah this kid like ran into me and i managed to keep balanced, but just leave me to skate by my self and i'll trip over myself. oy ve. So then we went to the Oregon Diner in philly, except the "rego" part was like not lighten up, so it was the "on diner" anyway this guy gave us free pastries because we were italian.... (he worked there though, like he got us stuff from the counter, he wasn't some crazy from the street) mmmm cookie.... Yeah so then we came home and here we are. Tonite we are going to my cousins' house for new years. That should be fun. We'll get to make fun of the drunk adults, woot. alright i'm tired of typing i'll update tomarrow, maybe.
