I loved my cabin (girls 1). We had so much fun. There were also some pretty powerful evenings. Among the favorites for the teens was the stations of prayer. They went from place to place around the camp where a passage of scripture and a suggestion for related prayer were posted. I was impressed by how focused each group seemed to be.   I did get to do the devotionals at campfire every night. That was a very good experience for me. I ended up working with the youth minister from Glendale instead. It worked out well. August complimented me (which meant a LOT) and said I may end up with the job every year. :-) We shall see.   After a day and a half home to do laundry (which turned out to be a fiasco as I washed AND DRIED a pen) and enjoy the restful sleep my bed provides, Erin and I headed to Idyllwild to Kings Kamp. This one is for 4th through 8th grades. Erin had a cabin of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade girls. Totally wiped her out, but it seemed to be very good for her. I got to room with two other girls who were staff for the week. Audry and I had an especially good time and enjoyed our conversations with each other. I'll miss her. She was in charge of the music videos the cabins made all week. I helped with the twice daily recreation times (one for the boys, one for the girls). I think the hike was my favorite.   Yesterday during our carnival time it began to rain big drops with incredibly beautiful peals of thunder. I think that actually turned out well as the games were more toned down and everyone spent a lot of time carving soap and making lanyard keychains. Later that evening an artist came and created a very cool landscape chalk piece. Under the blacklight appeared a picture of the risen Jesus. Pretty cool. Then I helped clean up the camp until 1am and got up at 6.30am to shower and pack up. Now for the unpacking, laundry, and catch up.
