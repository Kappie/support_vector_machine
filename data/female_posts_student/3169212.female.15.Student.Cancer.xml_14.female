It is wrong and illegal.      ***   Kurama stalked through the forest angrily. Why did Kuwabara have to wave his spirit sword around like an imbecile?   He continued through the woods.   Suddenly a huge, ugly, monstrous demon walked through. The other demon looked as though he was pieced together from the parts of other demons. It had ugly bluish-gray skin and sickly yellow hair. The demon had a small horn on its head. Small, white, feathered wings were barely visible over its gigantic shoulders. Its finger and toe nails were green and yellow and all jagged. Kurama didn't even want to dwell on its swelled, bulbous face.   "Show me to the nearest human flesh depository and I will devour you quickly and not so painfully," it roared.   Kurama took the rose tucked behind his ear and it immediately turned into the long, green, thorny, and elegant Rose Whip.   Suddenly, there was a streak of red glowing energy that pierced the demons ugly face. The grotesque demon exploded in a bright white light and was disintegrated.   After the carnage had cleared he looked up into the trees to see a demon holding a bow made entirely out of red demon energy. She had dark brown hair that was split into two short braids that hung just a bit below her shoulder line and two black tails tipped with white could be seen swishing behind her. She had black cat-like ears with a magenta interior and blue glasses over her deep brown eyes. The demon wore a hooded sweatshirt that was ragged and too large for her. It had gray sleeves attached to the maroon body with two gray dragons flanking a yin-yang sign a little bit under the neck. She also wore tattered blue jeans and blue and white tenis shoes that were on their last legs.   She jumped from her branch and landed shakily on the ground, lacking the grace that normally accompanied demons of her nature, but on her feet.   "That's the second one I've had to kill today. Name's Baka, by the way," she said in a clear alto voice. "And you are?"   "Kurama," Kurama responded.   "You know, you have the same name as that famous, dead thief, Yoko Kurama," she pointed out.   "He's not dead. I am him."   "But he had white hair."   "I had to escape into the human world."   "Oh, I feel stupid now."   "That's not surprising."   "What's that s'pose to mean?" she asked angrily.   "Your name is Baka..." He never finished his sentence. Baka hit him over the head. "Hey!"   "No one makes puns on my name," Baka warned.
