Just WOW       People on the Internet always amaze me.           People in general always amaze me.Overall, NSYNC fans NEVER fail to amaze me.           When I say that, I mean in intelligence, care, friendship, wonderfulness, and...     in their downright naivety and ignorance.          I'm not calling anyone stupid, but I will call some people blind. Of the people I come in contact with on the Internet, 90% of them are NSYNC fans. Ok, I'll chalk that up to an overwhelming 99.9%. I'm a people watcher, both on and off of the Internet. There's a lot to be learned by how people speak and act when you're not completely engaged in what they're doing or saying. It gives you time to see what their opinions are, what their beliefs are, and how they have been manipulated by thoughts or practices that aren't really their own, but they have accepted as "truth" in their world.          Oh I'm definitely an NSYNC fan. There's no doubt about that. I would never insult anyone's intelligence by saying that they don't interest me or turn me on quite a bit...but there's a difference between being a fan, and being a rabid card carrying fan club nazi. There's a big difference between supporting them, and having them become every part of your existence, including the points you make in arguments. (stupid or not)          I visit many NSYNC boards, I have a board of my own, and I also get enough emails to keep any good fan club staff in business for a LONG time. But overall, I don't see these as fan adorations or even "contact" letters towards me. I see them as opportunities to see what people are like out there. Now that I have a journal that people respond to, I get to people watch even more.          Some people call me psychic, some of my close friends wonder if I have a sixth sense, but in all honesty...my skills are honed and perfected by watching. Watching watching watching wherever I go.          So it stuns and amuses me when I travel around the Internet and see what people write or express with their names attached to it. It stuns and BEMUSES me what people will throw out as their "opinion" or the "backing up" of their opinion. When in all reality, it only makes other people's arguments sound that more intelligent.          I'm in my mid-twenties. I've been through college. I've lived more life than most of my readers out there, or NSYNC fans in general. My opinions are set, yet they are open to new views and new interpretations. I don't look at the age of the speaker, I look at the message. If the message is worthy of my investigation or ponderment, then I pay even closer attention. But there are a few things that need to be said in regard to that.          Now that I've said that my opinions are set, I'd like to clarify that. What that means (in regard to NSYNC, other bands, etc) is that I'm not easily swayed or influenced by rumors or argument trends. You know what I'm talking about. The same old debates that float around endlessly. The debates over Britney and Justin, the debates over OTown, the debates over Lance or JC being gay, and so on, and so forth.          Here's the core of my argument:     I made a statement in my last entry that I was listening to OTown at the time. I also put the quote that it was scary that I was actually listening to it. Immediately there was a response of anger and insult that I would dare hint to the fact that OTown isn't worthy of listening to.           I never said that. But I will say it now. OTown...is not...a group...I think...is good. But that's not the debate here. The debate is the REASONS, the ASSUMED reasons why this person thinks that I don't like OTown as a band.          Because of a dislike that NSYNC once had for them, or still continues to have.          I know that a lot of people out there are greatly influenced by their idols. If Justin eats popcorn, that is now their favorite food. If JC hates BBQ, then they will never touch BBQ again because JC MUST know what he's talking about. Maybe it's even a small tribute to the man every time you sit at a BBQ restaurant with your friends and casually sip on water instead of partaking in the festival of food.           But all it's really proving is that you have no mind of your own.          I have a mind, a damn good one, and I'm not going to let people I RESPECT dictate what I do, think, eat, say or live my life. Why on earth would I allow a pop-group full of men who wouldn't alter their lifestyles for me, tell me what I should do, think, say, eat, or how I should act?          I don't like OTown. It has nothing to do with them being with Lou Pearlman, with them being disliked by NSYNC at one time (or currently), with them being jackasses, with them being great guys, with them being anything other than mediocre pop-artists IN MY MIND. Am I saying that everyone should believe that way? Nope. I can understand why people love them and love their music. However, it's just not for me. I have my reasons, they're tried and true, and they work for me and my life. But what sadness it is that people believe that humans in general are so stupid and ignorant that they would pass up the opportunity for a band to be part of their entertainment enjoyment, just because another band dislikes them? This is like saying that I hate all brunettes because my mom doesn't like brunettes. It would be a mindless practice, and one that shows immaturity and the lack of a backbone.          The other debate I see all around the Internet, is about Britney Spears. Can I roll my eyes now? I don't think I can roll them enough.          Is she a role model? Is she too sexy? Is she a slut? Is she sleeping with Justin? Is she cheating on Justin? Is she a bitch? Does she sing live? Is she a studio creation? Is she using Justin? And on, and on, AND ON.           What's the famous retort that Britney supporters give? "You're jealous" OR "You just hate her because she's dating Justin."          Are we seeing the stupidity here yet? Are we seeing the fact that those people who throw those two excuses around, are really doing nothing but making themselves seem even DUMBER than the ones who can't initially back up their opinions? Not everyone has to like everyone else. If Britney is your queen, you go! I think it's great that you've found someone that you look up to, admire, and enjoy. But that doesn't make other people wrong when they find her faults. That doesn't mean that you liking her, is the way it SHOULD be. Why do the supporters find the need to convert those who dislike? Does Britney need a posse of supporters who recruit people in like old people to an Amway convention?          But the number one thing I'm saying here...just because you dislike, doesn't mean you're jealous or angry over her relationship with Justin.          I don't like Britney Spears. In fact, I dislike her so much that I'm numb to her. She doesn't bring joy to my life or bring disappointment and anger. She's just not there. I'm not going to go into the reasons why I think she's the biggest waste of space that Jive ever signed, because that's nobody's business but mine. However, at the same time, I DO understand why people like her. And I'm cool with it. If you want to love her, then love her. I'm not going to shove my distaste for her into your face, don't shove your admiration into mine.           But at this point I can see the anger already. I see the fingers that are just itching to say "Lyn, you only hate her because she's with Justin." OR "You only hate her because you're jealous." I don't have to be envious or jealous of someone to dislike them. I don't have to yearn to BE like someone, in order to not like what they're doing. I don't like her, I have my reasons, she's not my thing, and that's that. I will not be converted, nor will I stand for someone TRYING to convert me. It's an insult to my intelligence, and it only solidifies in my mind (when someone tries with these stupid reasons for adoration) why I dislike her to begin with.          I guess the gist of what I'm saying here is...if you're going to argue or debate, come up with original material. Come up with things that make you sound somewhat intelligent or would push people to see your side. And for goodness sakes, be open-minded! RESPECT the fact that not everyone can be into what you're into. Not everyone loves Justin's smile, or Chris' sense of humor, or Britney's hair. Not everyone loves songs about wet dreams or dream of Ashley Angel.           And you know what? That's ok!          Walk away with the attitude of...."They don't know what they're missing."         I just love this entry. Deep, really deep. Really cool person. I'm seriously speechless. This lady here could very well be my role model... inspiration.       -Speechless-       One...your like a dream come true...     Two... jus wanna be with you...     Three... girl its plain to see...that your the only one for me...     Four...repeat steps one to three...     Five... make you fall in love with me...     If ever I believe our work is done....then I start Back at One.
