"This month will have its plusses and minuses. What else is new? Always the practical one, a Capricorn gets upset at nothing I say. Bless your heart. Your balanced, practical approach to life is the secret of your success and the envy of your friends. I love your spirit. Don't ever change!   Let's start at the top of the month and go through each aspect in chronological order.   Yay!  Let's do it to it!!   (edit)  One tough day is sure to be May 25 when Mars will meet up with Saturn. They will stand toe-to-toe in your seventh house of committed relationships. Mars will make you ache to be assertive, while Saturn will say, "Wait! Not yet! Give this time"! Saturn will win this contest, so you might as well resign yourself to being patient.  Think this has already happened, but okay, whatever.   This matter has to do with a romantic or business partner, and you will feel this aspect gaining in power for the whole second half of the month as it reaches perfection.   I love perfection!   (edit)  At the end of September 2004, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will enter the zenith of your chart, your tenth house and ruler of your career status and promotion. It will be the first time in twelve years that Jupiter has visited this house.   About damn time!   This is a sensational prospect. Jupiter will remain in this house for thirteen MONTHS! This is the best and biggest aspect you could possibly want for professional advancement. But wait! There is more! In mid-October, five planets - half the solar system - will crowd into your sector of fame and honors, making October 2004 one for the record books.  That October always finds a way.   It's important that you don't let Venus retrograde get you down in the dumps or distract you from your purpose.  Stupid Venus.  Everything you are doing now will count toward your impending victory in late September or October, so you want to keep your record strong. You have been waiting literally years for this massive opportunity, and you will want to be in a position to take full advantage of it.  Shit damn right!   Venus also rules romance, of course, and with Venus in your sixth house of work projects, you could become smitten with a coworker or a supplier who you come in contact with frequently.  Like my dealer?   In general, there are some key points to consider when Venus goes retrograde. May 17 to June 29 would not be a good time to schedule plastic surgery.  It would not be the time to launch a big party, spend a great deal of money on clothes or jewelry, or go to that la-de-da spa.  Well, shit, what's the point?   (edit)  Some of the best news of the month concerns romance. Married or single, on May 19 your love life will get a huge boost by the new moon in Taurus. If you are single, even with Venus retrograde you should see a new romantic, social influence start to dominate your life.  Maybe a little bit!   After a long drought, your love life should start to sparkle and it will become easier for you to meet a new romantic partner. A friend seems willing to make an interesting introduction - allow her ( you mean him? ) to do so.  Shut the fuck up.     (edit)   Speaking about talent, you may show off a wonderful talent yourself this month. This new moon will bring out your creativity in a big way. If you work in a creative field, there will be no limit to what you will be capable of turning out. A new moon brings two weeks of very, very powerful energy, dear Capricorn. It is there for you to use or - if you don't take advantage of it - to lose.  Sucker.  I'm coming evening pages, I promise.       Jupiter, the great benefic planet, has been retrograde since January 3 and will turn direct on May 4. This is sensational news because Jupiter will begin to work very hard for you for the rest of 2004! As a result, exciting travel may come up now or later. (Mid-September appears to be a major time for a journey.)  Journeys rock!   If you want to travel during May, you will have two distinct moments when this would be a fabulous idea:   First, from Saturday, May 15 to Monday, May 17 you may take an unexpected short trip that will turn out splendid.   And it did.     On Friday, May 21 though Sunday, May 23, you may take a long trip. If so, it would work out sensationally well. You will have the action of Mars combined with the blessings of lucky Jupiter to thank for these golden days.   If you choose not to travel, you may find the dates mentioned will stand out to advance educational interests, international commerce, citizenship, relationships, or a publishing or legal matter.  Oh good!  That book I've been writing about a secret community of junior honors English professors who travel abroad and become embroiled in the white slave trade with Irish-American militants while exploring their growing mass attraction for their tour guide/attorney, Hanz, will finally be published this weekend!!  SCORE!   So you see, dear Capricorn, you do have some very dazzling aspects along with some less-than-perfect ones. Your sign is known to have a great sense of humor - the best of any sign in the zodiac. This month, laugh. It will be your best tonic, along with love and affection, which should be in full force this month, too!"  All in all, a pretty good one, I'd say.
