Besides being chased by random people who want to kill you and know exactly where you are, plus playing piano competitively, my next ugliest feeling is doing something, but knowing that there's going to be something weird about it. Like going out to lunch after APs that one time. And going to the mall tonight. In Angela's Ashes, Angela talks constantly about being in Limbo, and maybe that aptly describes it. Almost there, but not. Hanging, and you don't know if it's the right thing to do. It's not going to work out.   And no spoons tonight. Hah.  My favorite question is "Are you happy?" I was tempted to ask Dad tonight. I also wish I could go upstairs and say sorry to Mom.  Huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou. I've tried Maya, but not huevos yet. I'm not hungry.
