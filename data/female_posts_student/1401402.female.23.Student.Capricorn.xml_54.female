Not that I didn't respect it but happiness isn't what i'm looking for rite now.   Don't get me wrong! Happiness and success are two different prospects. Happiness is being with people you truly love. Amazing things all around. Being with a person won't make me happy for the rest of my life. I need to be experienced in the outside world. I need a balanced of both, being happy and work hard for what I shall succeed for.   I don't think that leaving him was wrong. I wanted someone with imagination, who is manly enough to take charge and untangle problems. I need someone with a positive inspiration. I need someone who would make me romantic dinners. I need someone who can give me feed backs on my opinion. I need someone who can be vulnerable and adventurous. I need someone who can make me smiles at all times. Someone I can look up to is all I need.   We spent hours on the phone last night. Why did you have to call me? My feelings for you aren't there anymore. You're not the person I want to be with. I've moved on and now it's your turn. Dont make me live in the past because that isn't where I want to be.   In just a few short lines I brought myself back to some of the darkest days I'd ever experienced. So lonely so hurt so bleak and hopeless and depressed.
