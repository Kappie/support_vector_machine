Unfortunately I'm the only one who will eat fish without batter or a frydaddy. I'm definitely going to have to find someone to go with me. But who...  candice called and invited me to Juri's. I said no, because I don't have a ride, I don't like juries, I don't want to go anywhere, and I MUST study for my biology test.  gag me I don't feel like going back to school!! But it will be a short week, and hopefully I will do something interesting next weekend.  Mr. Beach canceled. It's ok though, I haven't practiced much. I wonder what kind of presidents day function he's playing at?  this was an extremely uninteresting post.
