So yeah, we had our performance last night, and people actually laughed, so that was good. And then I played my song. It was really cool, because they forgot to put that I wrote the music in the program, so they announced it. It was like "In tonight's performance of 'Uncool', the music was composed by Liz Hutchinson." It was really nice to be recognized for that. Anyways, I played I few wrong chords, but overall it went really well. Emily, Melanie and I are going to the Catchstone concert tonight and I'm really excited. I'm also volunteering at the LP Winterguard competition tomorrow afternoon. That should be amusing. I thought it would be good to support them, as a member of the marching band. Plus, its not like I have anything better to do on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, so I think thats it. Yeah...
