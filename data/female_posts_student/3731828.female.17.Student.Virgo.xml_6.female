Ilosaarirock festival is this weekend and I still don't know how and when am I going to get there. My two friends don't know if they're going there tomorrow or on Saturday, and they don't know if they're going by bus or by their own car. I really wouldn't want to go by myself, coz it's a two-hour drive and it's just boring without any company. So i wish they would just make up their minds already and inform me as well so I could take a same ride as they do! :/  Another things that piss me off: that I just can't get any sleep even tho it's almost 3 am, that it's just impossible for me to get myself out of bed before 11 am, and that my latest driving lesson didn't go very well (apparently I drive too fast :P).   One happy thing, tho: I visited a friend of mine today that I haven't seen in ages. She had the cutest little puppy! He was so tiny, black, happy and way too adorable. :) Too bad I didn't have my camera with me.
