As weird as it may seem, I still like watching it LOL :)  The EURO Cup 2004 in Portugal has started yet another soccer fever in the world :)  The opening match between Portugal and Greece to me and I bet everyone else too by surprise. I never once, before the match, thought that Greece may actually win the match.  But six minutes through (when Greece scored their 1st goal) I found myself supporting the Greeks. The Portuguese were playing a very haphazard game where there seem no be no flow or planning. Their expected smoothness and confidence must have hit rock bottom after their opponent's goal. It was indeed a sad game for then- 1st match, playing in home grounds against underdogs... And LOST!   Then came France vs England- that was war against the goal keepers! Too many penalties and free kicks to be given out. Apparently France's goalie is better :)
