(thanks twiggy for reminding me) so at the moment im listening to my favorite song of the moment. i dont know wut its called but it goes a lil something like this :  "i'm tryin to keep my feet on the ground .im gettin to like this feeling i've found. i'm gettin to love the thought of having you around . and i will never let you down." do any of you know that song? see i kind of love it to death . and it stops like half way through cuz bri SUCKS at burning cd's so i have to keep pressing repeat and listening to the same 2 minutes and 25 seconds of it over and over and over. not that i mind at all though! so did you all know that i got dumped? im not sure if i've told you yet. well yeah nathan dumped me so i better change my profile . [sigh] he claims it was because im a homo. but what i find quite ironic (and im sure you all will too) is that he dumped ME for being a homo ... but the girl he has a fancy for now (lauren) is know for making out with her girlfriends ... hmmm ... now humor me people ... WHOS THE GOSH DAMN HOMO ?????????? sigh ... sorry had to vent a bit there. whooo. lalala. its amazing how good that made me feel. stupid boys. wutever. i dont neeeeeed a boy. although some of my close gallies know that im already looking at someone. however i would like to stress the fact that i am in fact JUST LOOKING! like a rich woman window shopping for her children at khols .. shes just looking ... shed NEVER buy it. see wut i mean? lol i know im great at analogys. i must go now im afraid of my life. wait ... is it supposed to be afraid FOR my life. wutever kisses ~D~
