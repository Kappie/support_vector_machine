This seems to be the logical fate of most film scores, but in the case of Eternal Sunshine, Brion's insistence on certain themes popping in and out of his textures seems particularly appropriate, as the soundtrack's fluid matrix performatizes the cinematography's mind/body collapse: In the film, Brion's organi-synthgaze postlude "Phone Calls" plays after Joel decides not to try and save his first memory of Clementine, but just to enjoy it. Here, Brion's score meets Eternal Sunshine's oculophilia halfway, and fittingly comprises one of the film's most potent scenes." -  urlLink Nick Sylvester , Pitchforkmedia.   I may not know a lot about music, but these things should be understandable to persons of moderate intelligence, of which I believe I am one.  And this makes no sense to me whatsoever.    This is a nice segue, since I did see  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  I thought it was good, but not great.  I think there were certain problems with the plot that I will not go into here because I would not want to spoil the story for anyone who might want to see it.  But there were things in the plot that were secondary, and seemed tacked on only to advance the main plot.  And things like that annoy me, because secondary characters and plots are ususally my favorite parts of movies, and when they are independent, yet integrated, then I tend to get annoyed.  Perhaps those of you who have seen it will understand what I am talking about, without my being more specific.  Otherwise, I would recommend it.  It's unlike most things out there, and is very engrossing, while being distancing at the same time.  Of course, I haven't seen anything else out there at the moment, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.
