YAY!!!       Then we went to KMart so I could get Rachel's b-day gifts. Of course I got some of my OWN as well. This IS me we're talking about! Grams bought me 2 new pair of shoes. One are white SOHO courts w/ blue stripes on the sides, and the other are navy and pink leather tennies for gym. But when I don't HAVE gym they're for all the time. FINALLY new shoes!!! I miss shopping SO much.      And then we went 2 eat at Mangia's and I saw Eileen. DUH b/c she works there! But w/e. Then I came home and got online. GAH! I almost 4got! KEVIN'S BACK FROM HIS DAD'S!!! NOOOO!!!! Friday can't come soon enough so I can go to Rachel's and get away from him!
