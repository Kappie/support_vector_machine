I really enjoyed myself, another fab party from Andy - nice one! Found it hard to pull myself out of bed. No hangover for me, I didn't drink that much. Can't help but laugh at Matt W, I bet when he got up today he felt awful. Tsk tsk. Well I enjoyed myself and can't wait to party with Paul and Neil etc... again.
