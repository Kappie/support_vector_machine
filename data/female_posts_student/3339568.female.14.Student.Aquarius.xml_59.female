I just realised how much i had 2 tell her - i actually had 2 write a list of all the things i needed to say so i wouldn't 4get! It's going on 20 pages now, this is gettin ridiculous (haha)...she'll neva reply, she takes ages wen its a 2 page letter...ahh meh, the worst part is how if i want to tell her one thing, then I have to actually explain a whole other thing, like for eg. if i wanted to tell her how it was so funny that last wk at church Joel told me he actually wanted to BUY a Speedo Joel T-shirt, the I'd have to explain the whole story of Speedo Joel!  And I've also been complaining bout mi lack of luv life, and the complications of others! I spend half mi time worrying about other peoples luv problems and how I would solve them, and the other half worrying bout the lack of mine! U know, I'm just thinking now, that I luv the movie 'Love Actually', and that you're sposed 2 feel all good at the end, but i kinda feel sad, and kinda sad 4 miself, even tho that may sound weird, i can't help it. Like I'd like to have a bf, but i 'spose i just hav to trust god with it all, even tho it is hard, like wateva he has planned 4 me i just hav to try mi hardest 2 accept, i mean, if he wants me 2 hav heartbreak then no luv 4 ages, then mayb thats wats sposed 2 happen 4 sum reason, i mean i realli hav no idea, mel and hannah and i were praying outside at helens house about helping all of us just to accept what god has in plan 4 us and to always put him first, but u know, its hard sometimes....pray 4 me peoples  Beth
