I met Jon on Friday, and apparently, he's head over heels for me. He's called me at least twice a day to check up on me and flatter me some more. He left early Saturday morning for work and has been on the road since. Every minute he gets, he calls me. I talked to his partner and I'm told that all he does is talk about me. Jon tells me that he has a lost for words when it comes to me, and all he can think about is coming home. Buddy; you don't know me. Don't get me wrong, it feels good to already have someone practically wrapped around my little finger, but damn, give it some time! It makes me feel good about myself, but on the other hand, I feel shitty. I mean, who wouldn't when the guy you've been on and off with for a year and 8 months wont even talk to you? I haven't spoke with him since Thursday. I understand that he might be a little pissed off because of what I said to him, but DAMN, you don't have to be an asshole to me. 4 days later and you're still pissed? Get over it and grow the fuck up. It's not like I did something unforgivable. All I said was that I was pissed off, and that I had the right to be pissed at people who treat me like shit. It's true, right? I was just hinting to him that he needed to step it up and start treating me right for once. And look what happens when you do that shit! Someone else picks up where you left off. Serves you right, you fucking ass. I deserve to be treated like a fucking princess, and Jon agrees. So there you go. Ya damn right I'm going to rub it in your face. Maybe you should listen to your mother when she tells you to call me now! Your mom's a smart woman, why don't you try to learn something from her? I can hear it pouring outside my window, and I just realized that I don't know who I'm talking to. I'm talking to myself, yet some of the things I write are pointed to a person in particular. It's things I'd love to say to their face; out of anger; but can't, because I'm too sweet to be like that. No, that's not why. The truth is; I don't want to lose anyone. Speaking of losing people. FUCK YOU TWO WHORES. Though I know you aren't reading this (no one does), I just wanted to let you know that you BOTH such. You deserve each other. What's better than having a back-stabbing, trash-talking, fake-ass friend when you're one yourself? Maybe some day you'll both grow up. Have you turned into lesbian lovers now? You sure as hell look like it. You're damn near attatched at the hip. Maybe I need to grow up. I'm just pissed that it took me this long to find out who you both really are. I should've seen it. It feels like I've lost two of my best friends, but I'm better out without you. I don't need to turn out like either of you two. August 14 was my nephew's 5th birthday. Every day is a blessing with him around. I love that boy more than anything in the world. He will always be my life, even if I don't see him as much as I used to. Shame on my big brother. Shame on him for lying to my family to their faces. Shame on him for lying his ass off to me. Shame on him for calling me today and interrogating me (not like I told him anything anyways). Fuck him for being the lying bastard he is. At first I felt bad for his girlfriend, Katie, but after last night's incident, I'm not sure I feel as sorry as I was. Julie gave me Alayna's old clothes to give to Katie for Kaylin when she gets bigger, and you know what that bitch said to me? She told me she didn't want anything from her (and some other shit-talking). Okay, I understand, but she was rude to me. I was just being the middle-person (like always), if you have beef, give it to someone else. You fuck-face; I do favors for you left and right and now you think you can walk all over me, call me up for more favors out of no-where, ask me to drop everything I'm doing and then be rude to my face. If you didn't want them, you could've been nice, taken them, then drop them off at a goodwill. Don't get me wrong though, I love seeing Kaylin, but the only time I do see her is when she's dished to me for a favor. I'm 16, sometimes you can tell, sometimes you can't. I suppose you can't really tell reading my blog, mostly because I let myself go here. I mean, my childishness comes up, and so does my anger.
