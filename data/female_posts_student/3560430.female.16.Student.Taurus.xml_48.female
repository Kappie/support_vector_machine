Well to sum up, I disscussed,          My guilt at not haveing edited last night      The Sumptuary laws of the Elizabethan era      The brilliance of the Addam's family      My tragic book dillema, whether to read Voyager or Queen of the  Damned next, and the fact that regardless I will be takeing the other  to Calgary with me.            The fact that my wrist is cramping up and I need to go to edit.             No that that is summed up I shall go becaue of item number five. And a little bit of item numer two.
