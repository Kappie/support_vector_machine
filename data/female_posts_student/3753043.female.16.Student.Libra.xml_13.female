I changed the colours cuz it was too "Ooh looka me I'm black~~!" Or something like that... I cannot think T-T It's like my brain's there but it's all "I'm sorry, I'm not available right now" and it's all like wtf??? o_O I don't understand what I just said.. ah well. I got.. uhm.. 2-3 hours of sleep last night.. It was the most eventful sleep over ever.  First we (me and Nicole.. that it) took Cozmo and Skippy for a walk and this scarey old man was swearing at them. I think he was drunk. Then a bunch of dogs kept on running out of their yards and up to them which was  really  great x_X.  Then we got like food poisoning from the frozen yogert... or yogart?? I can't spell... T-T But then it was all like.. blah.. and then we decided to chat after watching many an anime.. I can't remember exactly what we watched... but it was good... >_>  So, yes, we were chatting and then strange guys kept on attempting at trying to convince us that we were lesbians and that we wanted to cyber (what else is new?)... needless to say we weren't either of them, so the horny little bastards lost.  But then comes the most eventful part! Cuz Derek had to go to bed so we had to get off his comp and go into the comp room to continou (how do hell do you even spell that word anyways!??) chatting with strange peoples. But then... there was a SPIDER!! And then Nikki decided to be brave and try to catch it with a cup but it was scarey and it ran scarily which made her jump and us both scream. But then she hit her knee on a bunk bed post that was behind her and gashed it open. Blood was every where, we went to the hospital and had to wait at least 15 minutes before anyone would even give Derek the papers to fill out. And this was in a the emergency section which makes me loose faith in the reliability of our medical services.  Anyways, then nurse thay wheelchaired Nikki into the medical room asked her "Why are you crying so much?" in a pretty snotty voice. She then said "There's a lady with a fractured knee in the other room you know." I mean, jesus, way to treat your patients with repect. Even if it was 3 in the morning, no reason to be such a bitch. I felt so bad for her cuz the doctor kept on prodding at the gash for like five minutes before he glued it up. Then after it dried this ditzy sounding nurse came up to Nikki and was all "Where's you wound?" cuz she needed to tape it up. I guess it would make to much sense to just look near were all of the blood was. Anyways... it was a pretty interesting and memorable experience. Anyways, nothing I'm doing right now can really top that so I'm not going to mention it.. except maybe the fact that I'm in a garage. Yes, our new comp room is our garage. It's strange...
