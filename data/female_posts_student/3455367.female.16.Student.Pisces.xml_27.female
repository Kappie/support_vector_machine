Furthermore our school is not stupid, alot of people in our school are really really smart and lots get over 90 in there UAI's.. but we also have the stupid people which drag us down. It is quite Immature to generalize, really.  Also Maya and Joelle got highest in the year many times in year 10, and furthermore Joelle got highest in English, Geography, History etc. on practically EVERY test in year 8 and 9, and maya went well also. *snort* Joelle also got 100% in 7 assesment test in year 8 and Maya got 100% in 4 tests.  lol. And yeah..Joelle got accepted to one of those selective schools when she lived in Brisbane.. but chose not to go. Joelle. Maya and Simona *choose* not to work as much as other, and study all the time in year 11 because it doesn't count for anything and there is more to life than SCHOOL, school SUX. You only live life once, why waste it by STUDYING!? *shudder* Just because we don't go to a EE school and study all the time doesn't mean we are not academic. Pfft.. not mature, like you can talk.  WHO was looking at porn on Danyells login...BENJI!!!!!!!??????? LOL! just kidding.  Also, well I can't say much for Simona, but Maya *cough* (she made me put that in) and Joelle do CARE about real shit and politics (although they would like to stress that politicans are evil.)   Sincerly, Noushi. (evil minion of Joelle and Maya.)  p.s. don't take this fully serious or anything Benji ; )
