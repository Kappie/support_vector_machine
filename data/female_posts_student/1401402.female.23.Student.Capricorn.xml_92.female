You're handsome as ever. You're still the sweeties guy I've ever known. You were a lover with the sweeties touch, with a slow hand and an easy touch. But that was five years ago.   Reuniting and a nite of singing our ass off at a karaoke bar was amazing, but you know what no matter how hard you try you'll never win me back into that old position. I'll never fall for you ever again nor will I ever date you as a boyfriend again.   So what if you sang "All I Have To Give". It eventually brought back alots of memories since high school but that doesnt mean anything to me anymore. I've moved on and you know I did. So quit trying to play games with my heart and quit trying to win me head over heels.   Many many years ago I would say, I've alwyas been in love with you, I guess you've always known its true. You took my love for granted why? Its only fair that we say good bye. So good bye Josh.
