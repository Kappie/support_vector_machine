I had a nice long talk with her about how her trip to Texas was and how I dont want school to start. I dont know it was nice to hear from her.    I decided that I am going to start the morning Kardio Kick class at the karate center. It starts tomorrow and I cant make it because of my ortho. appointment but I am going to go on friday. Its only on wednesdays and fridays which kind of sucks but maybe I will do the night time ones on some days. I dont know. But I know I need to get myself into shape. I want to look good before school starts. And I want a job before then. And maybe even get my braces off before then, that one might be pushing it but I am praying.    Oh my goodness. NipTuck was so good tonight. I love that show. I really love Christian Troy, he's one sexy man. And I didnt have to watch alone because my sister came home early from work because she didnt feel well so it was kind of nice to have someone there. I was bummed that they arent showing it again right now, instead Rescue Me is on. GRRR. They are determined to confuse me.    Man... I cant believe that I am going to be a Junior. It just doesnt feel right. But I'm also not going to complain because that means 2 more years and then I am done with high school. And that thought makes me sad but also I am ready to get out of here. Its so weird growing up with the same people forever. I mean I have been with these same kids all my life so even though it sucks that I dont have a boyfriend, I also have to realize these are just a few of the people that I will meet in my life and I have known almost all of them too long to date. I mean the only people that I have been interested in are people that I just started to talk to. Everyone else are more like siblings that love interests. Okay I'm lame. I am really really lame. Who cares. Its the truth, isn't it? Anyways I still cant believe it. Holy Crap!! I feel really old. When really I'm not old at all. But older than I used to be. Which is logical.    Well I have to go to bed because of my appointment tomorrow morning. We have to leave by 10 so that means I have to get up at 8:30 or 9:00 because Kevin and I both have to shower.   Goodnight   -Gabby
