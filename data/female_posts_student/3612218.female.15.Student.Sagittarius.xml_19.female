Lots.. Then mum and I went shopping at town. Ha. Bot many things as well. Caught a movie with her too. Harry Potter was a disspointment. Im totally shacked after that. I have no idea. Mum seems very energetic, still happily looking at all the stuff she bought. I need sleep terribly. Hadn't complete any shit yet. Gotta go for tuition early in the morning tmr. Haiz.. Wad to do? Juz have to do wad i need to do.. Im happy! :)))    Ok, off i go. I need to ... zzz  Not forgetting.. Today is Nicole's Birthday! Happy birthday! :)))
