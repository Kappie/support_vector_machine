I stumbled upon the GREATEST thing ever: a new  urlLink Rainbow Brite doll!  and it even came with her sprite, Twink.  Now all I wan to get is Starlite so I can be seven years old again.  Rainbow brite is my all time favorite 80's thing ever, so needless to say I was super stoked.  We went and saw Jersey Girl and as I previously mentioned in the Don's comments, it was really good.  You all should definitely get out to check it out.  Saturday we went to the car wash and to  urlLink Costo  for chorish stuff we had to get done, and then we met up with Billy to go to lunch at Applebee's, which was yummy and since it was such a beautiful day we met up with Bex and all cruised around in Bill's mom's convertible.  It was a lot of fun, except for Bex's death-defying attempting to climb into the front seat with me while we're on the highway and she only weighs 3 lbs. and will get blown away.  After we watched  urlLink UConn  make their way to the Final Four, Andrew decided to cook dinner.  It was yummy steak and biscuits (muffins, whatever) and rice and string beans.  Lemme tell ya, the boy can cook.  Certainly cooks better than me, but to be fair even a retarded chimp with glaucoma and one arm could cook better than me.  Ice cream was gotten with Todd and Melissa and then we all came back to the apartment and watched Event Horizon.  I was a little disappointed.  I remember seeing the movie when it first came out in theatres and being scared poopless.  Not so much that its scary, but the concept of it is fucked up.  Execution of said concept was pretty poor though.  I just liked it because at the time I was crushin' hardcore on Jack Noseworthy who had recently ended his stint on MTV's Dead at 21.  (Okay, I know it wasn't a good show, but gimme a break, he was hawt!)  After only seeing the Alien Quadrilogy for the first time in December 2003 I've come to realize that almost every space movie has ripped it off in some way shape or form, be it sets, plotlines, etc.  Sunday I headed home and got girlie with my mom and grandma as we got our manicures and pedicures and I visited the spa for a quick trip.  I finally managed to almost entirely clean my room (all i have left to do is take out trash and make the bed, hollaaaaaa!) I ate a totally yummy dinner with my family and then went to watch Andrew in action in his hockey game.  He did a great job and his team plays really well together.  I have to tell ya: shut-outs are pretty sexy.  (c:  I hope all of you enjoyed your weekends as well.  Hopefully I'll get some pics of how hardcore Rainbow Brite is!  Peace out, kids!
