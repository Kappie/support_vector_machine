"someone" showed me their drugs at school today..it made me feel sick. drugs seem so stupid and harmful that i dont know how people can do it. i guess you just have to really want to do them, and be rich. Anyways i am totally happy to be going to the concert tonight. it will be very fun, i can tell. if it isnt i will be shocked. but i mean come on chris will be there and that makes it fun!
