Ah well. Going with friends will be fun, right? Of course. It'll be a lot of fun. It would just be cool to have a date, y'know? I'm sick of being single. Lol. Even if I just had guy friends, that would be cool. I really don't have any guy friends. Being around girls all the time gets boring.  Anyyywho.... I guess I'll go do homework.
