Back to LA for games 5 and maybe game 6.  Tuesday nights post might be full of 'yey pistons', but I doubt it.  Like Sod said, I want the Lakers to lose more than I want the Pistons to win.    Superfly won!  Vegas looks good on me!  Uh, yeah.  You know what I mean.  Hot August heat, slot machines and free liquor.  What more could a Midwestern girl need?  I'll tell you what more....well, no.  I cant do that.  But it  might  involve Tequila, lemons and  BTCS .  Maybe some  Crash  and  R2T.     So joys- Went to Target to pick up a few things, and of course she thinks she needs to get something every time we go.  "I need this Barbie." "No, you don't."  "Mo needs this car."  "Yes, Mommy needs to get Mo something for your birthday."  See, I never thought of it before, but I always say "your birthday", I mean, it is, 'their birthday', but it's also 'her birthday' and 'his birthday', I always go back to 'your birthday'.  Wow, I just confused myself.  After all that present talk, someone said they had to use the restroom.  Got half way there, no one has to use the restroom.  But this someone decides that since she isn't getting anything, that she'll just lay down on the floor at Target and start screaming, then proceed to yell that she cant get up.  I felt like I was in that commercial where the old lady can't get up.  Instead of letting the entire store hear my daughters beautiful voice, I went over to her and got her up.  Everything was fine after that, like nothing happened.  She is good at that.  One minute it's total drama, the next is if nothing happened and it's just a great day.  I tell ya.  I didn't have Mo with me, he went with Grandma.  Its good for them to spend time apart.  Dinner @ this really classy place where they already have the wine glasses on the table, which got fingered and violated right away when we sat down.  "Please don't mess with the glasses."  "I WANNA SIT BY YOU MOM!"  Great to be Mom.  Dinner was great though.  Good food.  Told Sophia that we would probably go somewhere else for ice cream.  So when the waitress came and asked if anyone wanted dessert, she told her we were going somewhere else.  Guess you had to be there.  It was cute.      Why can't I get just one kiss? Why can't I get just one kiss? Believe me,  Somethings I wouldn't miss But I look at you pants and I need a kiss.  Why can't I get just one screw? Why can't I get just one screw? Believe me, I'd know what to do. But something won't let me make love to you.  Why can't I get just one fuck? Why can't I get just one fuck? I guess it's got something to do with luck But I've waited my whole life for just one  Day after day I get angry And I will say That the day is in my sight When I take a bow and say goodnight  Oh my my my my my oh my mum Have you kept your eye Your eye on your son? I know you've had problems You're not the only one When your sugar left, he left you on the run  Mo my my my my my mo my mum Take a look now Look what your boy has done He's walking around like he's number one You went downtown and got him a gun.  Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me You know you got my sympathy But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me You know you got my sympathy But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me   Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs Can I mix in with your affairs? Share a smoke, Make a joke Grasp and reach for a leg of hope Words to memorize, words hypnotize Words make my mouth exercise. Words all fail the magic prize Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs  Oh my my my my my mo my mother I would love to love you lover City's restless It's ready to pounce Here in your bed from ounce to ounce Sayin' oh my my my my my mo my mother I would love to love you lover The city's restless It's ready to pounce Here in your bed from ounce to ounce  I've given you a decision to make Things to lose, things to take Just as she's about ready to cut it up She says Wait a minute honey I'm gonna add it up Add it up (x8) Day after day I get angry and I will say That the day is in my sight When I take a bow and say goodnight   So sings this song and it's a riot.    Peace.Love.DMB.   |5 days|
