Old ones aren't too reliable, new ones aren't the most reliable either but that would be really cool.  You guys know how ryan went to that parade in San Francisco, right?  I'm watching the video he took of it, and it's pretty halarious!  Him and Brad are having a heated argument with this guy over Bush and things.  Anyways.  Yeah
