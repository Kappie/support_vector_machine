They didn't have a face or I just don't remember that part... My grandfather was playing a piano and he was wearing the same light blue suit that we buried him in.  Then right before I woke up my grandfather whispered in my hear "Everything is going to be okay!"  .... Then my phone rang and woke me up!! So I have no idea what he was telling me but I find this dream so strange because it seemed so real.  Today... Pap has been gone for 5 months!  I miss you and love you, Pap! Merry Christmas wherever you are!!
