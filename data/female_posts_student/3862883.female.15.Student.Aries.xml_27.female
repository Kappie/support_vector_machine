It plays a big role because it servised a lot of men to whom the nation is all proud of. Some men go and fight for their country or they go to discover different areas of the world. Some come back and some don't come back, all for the task that they set out for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              People go out for treasure for the thought of becoming famous. The sea is a part of history because it is an allie to the person who despritaly wants something.
