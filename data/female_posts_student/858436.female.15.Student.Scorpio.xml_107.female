It was so great, just a nice convo with one of your best girl friends. And we both came to the conclusion that we both feel the same way on guys right now - confused.   I'm so confused. I've been liking the same guy for, well, a long time, and absolutely nothing has happened between us. Not a freakin' thing. And now I don't know if I like him anymore, but it feels weird to not have a crush on him. It's like, I'm supposed to since I've had it for so long. More or a routine and ritual than based on feeling anymore. And at JP's awesome party, I was like, "dude, there are so many other guys out there that are so awesome, don't stay stuck on the same one!" And so I dunno if I even like anyone right now. It feels weird. I'm sick of having a "crush". I want to  like  someone, as in, they know it and they like me back which could lead to more. I'm so fed up with being single. It's very overrated. In case you haven't noticed, I'm not overpouring with self-esteem, which accounts for a lot of my "crushes". I'm SO TIRED of not being 100% confident of myself.   But yeah... Today I went to Memphis with Mamaw and went shopping, which of course is one of my favorite pastimes haha. Got some cute stuff.. it was a lot of fun! Um.. guess that's it..
