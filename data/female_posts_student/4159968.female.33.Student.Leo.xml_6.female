After my last blog he asked if we could talk on the phone. I found that talking to him was very easy. He managed to follow my jumps in topic and converstation. Friday *chuckle* I do not know which was more amusing. The fact that nothing seemed to go exactly right for him or his reactions. I literally laughed more than I have in a long time. He was attentive, courteous, lol and amusing. He arrived a bit early lol and proceeded to win the girls over. I finished getting ready and we headed out. First I forgot the sketches that had the measurements for the cabinets we were checking on. Then we get to Home Depot to see what was available and find that the truck has a flat. So we head back to the house to drop that truck off. When we return to the house, he offers to drive. So off we go. First we go the wrong direction lol but I have never seen a vehicle that could not turn around. So we head off again. Lol there were a lot of little things that seemed set on frustrating him.. lol and tickling me.  Even the stops we made... things always went a bit off. A store that almost always carries what I went for was out... lol things like that.  We returned to my house. I have to admit I was still a bit apprehensive. Probably because we are still in this getting to know you stage and its awkward and annoying=p. But I think things went amazingly well.
