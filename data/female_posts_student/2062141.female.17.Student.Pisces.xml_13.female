Those things are expensive. Like 50 bucks. I wanna be Tinkerbell. But yeah anyway, last weekend was PSATs (wow I totally don't know math.... what are they teaching us???) and then I had to practice that quartet thing with Mallorie's friends for 4 freaking hours!!! But then I didn't have to babysit after all and Charlotte got to spend the night. Hoo-raaay! And then I was in a bad mood because I had to finally go play the thing we've been rehearsing for... but mostly because of what I had to wear to it... see, Amy Wither's mom's Jane Austen society... it's one of those weird things where everyone's dillusional and thinks they're in oldie times (kinda like a renaissance fair aargh) so we had to wear ugly stupid dresses (mine looked like a baby's Christening gown it was HORRI-BiBLE). But it's over. Aaaah.  I can't wait til this stupid quarter is over. It's cursed I tell ya. Only horrible things happened this quarter. Except like those times my friends came to eat taquitoes and walk to the park, or watch (and make) bad movies. Or when Charlotte sleeps over. Or when me and Josh go cruisin'. Then it would turn Monday and everything would suck again.   PS. So are we going to Seattle on Wednesday or not???
