To the Scotsman he says, "You're in charge of shoveling." And to the Chinese guy, "You're in charge of supplies." He then says, "Now, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you guys to make a big dent in that pile." So the foreman went away for a couple hours and when he returns, the pile of sand is untouched. He asks the Italian, "Why didn't you sweep any of it?"  The Italian replies, "I no hava no broom. You saida to the Chinese fella that he awasa in a charge of supplies, but he hasa disappeared and I nocouldafinda him nowhere!" Then the foreman turns to the Scotsman and says, And you, I thought I told you to shovel this pile?" The Scotsman replies, "Aye, ye did lad, boot ah could nay get me self a  shoovel! Ye left the Chinese guy in chairge of supplies, boot ahcouldnay fin' him either." The foreman is really angry now and storms off toward the pile of sand to look for the Chinese guy. Just then, the Chinese guy leaps out from behind the pile of sand and yells "SUPPLIES"!   My apoligies to anyone who is offended by this joke! i assure you it it just a joke and not ment to be taken in any racisist manner!
