Oh interesting stuff happening...not a lot, apart from Dumbo Laura saying 'I am an idiot' 1,000 times! Yes, she kept count! (Nuts) I was like really early home too! I'm so happy! I kind of ran out, at jogging pace! Well today my knees killed and they started going half way across the field that I walk over! (field, I mean playing field of a school, not a country one!) and it hurt a lot. :( And then it decided to be smean and not let me bend it which, if you're trying to walk hurts a lot. You would think that if your knees hurt you would walk slowly, odviously I'm an exception because I legged it home more than usual because of the pain. When I got home, I pumped myself full of Ibruprofen, actually two tablets and got hassled by the cats. I'm in a colapsed state, state of mind really but my knees have gone all woobly. Isn't woobly so much better than wobbly?! (See what I mean by collapsed!) Two l's or one? I don't know, I've colapsed. *Whatever* Oh yeay Neighbours is on! (Wooh!) In...about an hour. :( Well see ya! Keep on woobling!
