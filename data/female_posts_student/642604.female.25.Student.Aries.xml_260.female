I clearly aced my quarterly exam today in Ear Training, I correctly answered the solfege question in my harmony class (which is 9 times out of ten answered incorrectly to put it in perspective for you) and my three o'clock ensemble was cancelled.  So here I am watching movies and hanging out till I get ready for the party I am going to tonight.  By the way, I want to know who put this one together... we're dealing with a beach party in Boston in the middle of February.  It's not like I am going to wear my flip flips on the T in February.... looks like I have to plan for this one.  Oh and one more thing.  I just finished Runaway Jury and I really liked it.  Of course I always like John Grisham movies.
