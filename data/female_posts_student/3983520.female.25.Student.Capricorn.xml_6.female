After all the drama my children's father caused he has even agreed to keep the kids for me. I just want to be foot loose and fancy free. It is not very often that I get some time to myself to do what I please without having to worry about the boys. I am going to miss them though. Elijah always make me laugh and Jeremiah is as cute as a button. I hope I hit the Jack pot! I still have a lot of running around to do though before I can settle into that plane seat and let it whisp me away to the land where dreams can possibly come true or I just leave you broke. LOL Wish me luck out there because I am going to need it according to how my week has been going.
