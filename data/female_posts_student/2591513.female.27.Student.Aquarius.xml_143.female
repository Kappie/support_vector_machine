We got to see Ed's old pals from high school...Noreen and Frank...whom we haven't seen in ages...and then the next day we saw Svetlana and her husband Sydney...we also saw an old acquaintance (friend for Ed, acquaintance for me) from St. Barnabas, Shannon and her cute daughter...we saw his friend Joyce from a distance...we saw Tim from a distance too...that's a long story...all in all it was nice to run into people.  It is amazing to see Aaron all graduated, it is too bad he couldn't come down with us, Alanna too.  I realized that life up there is so different from what we left and as much as I would like to come back since everything is better, it is a place I don't want to return to to live.  I want to raise my children here and hopefully have them retain strong ties to the life we have in the bay area.  I am just glad to be around a very different environment for my kids.  Don't get me wrong, I love the bay area but first of all we couldn't afford to live out there and second of all we couldn't really raise children there...but the family we have left there all adore the children and I know they would be surronded b y a lot of great people who love them above anything.  We were also glad to be up at that time because Ed's uncle was in the ER on Saturday...when we left him, we thought he was okay...only to find out the following day that he had a minor stroke.  We saw him beofre we left to be sure he was okay...thank God we did because he ended up having to have a stent put in one of his arteries...I am sure it reassured his mom and aunties to have Ed there.    We drove back and Ed got lost, go figure, I knock out and he gets us lost...haha...then we backtrack and go to Patterson to see his cousin Rob.  He and his wife are great people...we had our differences a long time ago, but things are better and it is always nice to see our kids play together.  So we drive back home...I took the last 3.5 hours.  It was a nice and quiet drive.  I was getting tired towards the end.  After further discussion Ed and I have agreed to leave the children to Leila should anything happen to us and we aren't survived by my parents of course...initially they were to go to Keiko, but after thinking about it I knew that they would probably feel better being left to family and Leila has seen them through a lot of their growing an I know she would make the perfect "second" mommy to the kids...plus she knows me better than anyone.  I know her and kata would raise the children well.  Keiko loves the kids with all her heart, but it is such a great burden to leave to her.  I want her to enjoy her own children...and well I don't see my sisters having children...well anytime soon...I don't know.  Keiko was very kind to accept the responsibility, but it is such a great favor to ask of a friend...plus I know my kids would be more comfortable with their cooky aunties (am I?  haha yes I am)  Anyhow, I miss my two oldest friends Keiko and Tim, but it looks as though our paths have diverged...I hope that our paths one day cross again and I look forward to having a stronger and deeper friendship when the time does come.  Friendships never end, I am a great believer of that.
