Oh god tooo early.. lol.. It was my dad.. :( I got bitched at for a lil while.. then we got on my grades.. and then moving.. :( Well then I started to get pissed cuz he just doesnt listen to anyones opinion but his own .. and its total bullshit because hes gonna ruin my life.. I mean I have lived here all my life and he expects me to just act like I wanna move and like its not gonna bother me... and that is not gonna happen.. Well after that I went to the mall for like 10 minutes to get kimmy a present... I got her the New Found Glory CD.. and I got it too.. Then my lil bro go the Autopilot off Cd.. so yea.. it was cool.. then I went to kimmy's and swam like all day. It was fun then I went out to my grandmas house with my friend Jacob and visited people then hung out till my mom got to my grandmas.. That was fucking retarded so I walked to JD's which is like 2 minutes away .. he wasnt home but I got to drive his moms new car so it was cool.. Then I went back to my grandmas and we left.. I got Checkers on the way home!! That was seriously like the highlight of my day but when I got home it said that someone had been on my s.n in 2 other places! and the only person that haD my password was Amie.. and she must have been on in 2 diffrent places... Thats fucking stupid I mean damn how fucking stupid can you be!   Yep well .. I am getin of and gonna call wayne cuz Im bored..
