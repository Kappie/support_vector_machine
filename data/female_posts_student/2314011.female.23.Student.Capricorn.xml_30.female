Last year at this time we were down at Grandma and Grandpa's, throwing back a few egg nogs, admiring the shaggy carpet we were beginning to miss but didn't know why and trying to make my passport appear in the mailbox two days later.  I had plane to catch on the 27th, after all.    Spent the day seeing Return of the King again.  All else feels so insignificant when you come out of the theater after that one.  Cried a bit again, although no where near as much as the first time.  Made it though the first hour of the first viewing just dry heaving and the next two in wrenching sobs.  Dad will be home from worky soon; might venture out again, as a family, to another movie.  Not sure how I feel about visiting the same theater in the same day, but it's Christmas and there might be a chance of catching some naked Diane Keaton action...PARTY!    Talked to Natalie earlier today.  She's so damn cute and funny and hot.  And that's just over the phone!  She's the only gal from high school I still try (I should try harder, I realize, and I make no excuses) to track down whenever I'm in town.  I watched her performance in Highland's Dracula production in awe (and a wee bit of attraction), and nearly swooned when Levi brought her to the Mountain Fortress Get-Together the eve of the last day of junior year.  "Your bathroom is bigger than the blue banana!" she said as she made her way through the house at her own pace, and we haven't looked back since.  Imagined her zipping all over town in her new VW Golf without a care or worry about carbon monoxide in the world.  Forgot to ask her what she named her new charge.  If she hasn't named it yet, I think it should be called Gimli.  Not sure why.  She's coming out with the Boy and me to help celebrate my birthday Friday.  Should be nothing less than a sweaty, sticky, drunken good time.  Haven't seen her since this summer, but I know we'll all pick up right where we left off.  That's what's so great about her, really.  No matter where you've been or what you've done, when you're together again, it always feels like you never were apart.
