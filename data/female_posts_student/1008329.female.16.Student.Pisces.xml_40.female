I suppose that's good, but it doesn't stop 14-22 from wondering if 18 26-14.  He 21-15-18-9-7-22-23 with 14-22 all 8-11-26-13-18-8-19. Go figure. It all is like a 15-18-22.   Movin' to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, I'm movin to the country, gonna eat me alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches.  Peaches come, from a can, They were put there by a man, In a factory downtown. And if I had my little way, Id eat peaches everyday, Sun soakin' bulges in the shade.  Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches.  I took a little nap where the roots all twist, Squished a rotten peach in my fist, And dreamed about you, woman I poked my finger down inside, make a little room for an ant to hide, Nature's candy in my hand, or can, or pie.  Millions of peaches, peaches for me, Millions of peaches, peaches for free, (repeat till fade) -The Presidents of the United States, "peaches"
