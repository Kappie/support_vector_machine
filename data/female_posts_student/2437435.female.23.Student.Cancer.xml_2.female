He said he thought me being indecisive was cute... I don't know about that, everyone else thinks its annoying.  We had discussed religion and he doesn't buy into religion. Well, I remember at one point being an atheist.. but upon reflection I had discovered I was an atheist out of spite. Things happened that I didn't like, and bad things are perpetually happening to good people so why believe? Well, as logical as it may have been to me at the time; that theory did not hold up. Francis Bacon once said something like, "A novice in philosophy rejects God, but an expert returns to Him." I am not by any measure saying I am an expert. All I am saying is that, its harder to prove his existence than to be another great american skeptic. But I have been fiddling with a few possibilities. One, that man is innately good and does bad things (these bad things don't make him bad. There is a separation betwix act and man.) Or bad things happen to everyone equally just in different times, stages and ways, so no one is above this dealing. Thirdly, as Mia Farrow says, "Life is about losing, and doing it as gracefully as possible." Just as I said, no man can escape time, no one can escape a bit of bad luck and misfortune, and I would not want to. Granted I am super pessimistic anyway, but these things which seem to paralyze us for multiple moments and what makes us us. I do not think my life was at all as bad as some of my associates, though through different eyes I would see why other's would think it. And no matter how much pain is there, why wish something that made me whom I am today disappear, or block it out of memory?  I am resolute that things are not as bad as I make them out to seem, though I hate it when I am having my "Pity Party, Table for One" moment, and someone interjects to tell me that. I want to experience all aspects of life. The good with the bad. Besides, there is can't be a rainbow without the storm, the light without the darkness, the joy without pain and the life without death. There are enough     Momentomori in life, without Rob reminding me of them.
