Now we are watching "Star Wars"  hahaha. This holidays I'm going to sydney and staying on oxford street which is cool because Simona and Maya are staying there too.  I have to save up LOADS of money to buy manga, might buy some anime too, while I'm there.  Benji's friend James told me about some place where I can buy lots of Manga, which is cool. It's the strike today, that's why I'm not a school (thank bloody gawd).  Oh, this weekend I'm going to go to a doof in MainArm and also this party in Ocean that's on Friday. They should be fun. We were going to go camping but tonight, Friday and Saturday...but that didn't work out. Oh well, must go..  nye..?
