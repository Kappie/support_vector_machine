"Tell me why, tell me why," "Or am I just to late"  "You're not late." he tells her "You'll be better off without me." "I can't give you the happiness here and thereafter." "Why till now you still can't see?"  "Have you forgotten. have you forgotten?" she said "Oh, have I become a dream?" "What have we done to make this happen?" "Or will I forever be in your sleep."  "You can't love me in the day." "You can't be with me, I'm not real anymore." "I exist in you imagination, in our play," "At least love me before dawn"  "If I can't have it whole, I'll only take half" "In which I'll do my part" "I know you can give me any love from the start" "Before I fade I'll give you my heart."
