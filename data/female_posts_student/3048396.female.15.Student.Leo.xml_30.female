My mind is full of shit that I dont feel like thinking about right now so hopefully this will help. So yeah. Not much has been goin on. 14 more days of school...I'll probably end up failing Algebra cuz of the test I took Friday. My parents will kill me. *sigh* My life has been kinda sucky lately but oh well. I barely remember what happened last week. Is that sad? Yeah. Mr. Musle was gone a few days last week so in band Tracy, Camy and I hung out. We talked about everything and it was quite amusing. They also got a little crazy with the markers and they wrote all over my legs. I had "HOT!", "Tan me!" "And ME" and a whole bunch of arrows on my legs and then Jen and Paige drew on my arms and Paige had fun coloring my shoes and yeah it was interesting. I had piano that night and Julie just looked at me weird but thats okay. So yeah. On friday Tracy and I created a new game. Ghetto Shooter. Very amusing. We didn't have to do anything durring choir and we were in the gym so we got pony tail holders and started shooting em around and then one got stuck in the basketball hoop so we tried getting more stuck and we did and it was just great fun. We couldnt stop saying Timmy either. Timmy from South Park. Yeah. Very amusing. And in band we sat around some more and I wrote the part of our song "Yeah Pineapple" all over her arm. We are gonna try to record it soon. It'll be awesome. We're thinking maybe we could have a talk show someday and just have it all stupid with our stupid dumb things we say n do. So yeah. Friday night I stayed with Kim and we were bored so we went for a walk and picked up some red bull on the way. Gosh I was wide awake like all night. Damn that stuff works good. I love it! So yeah we went to the park to bring back memories and we started telling jokes n stuff so I brought up the one Jacob told at YC bout the Foo birds shiting...anyways after I told it I stood up cuz we were gonna start heading home and I looked down on my arm and what did I see? Bird Shit. Gosh that joke was a curse! lol yeah so I almost barfed and Kim laughed and we walked home to wash it off. So yeah that was amusing. Then on Saturday Kim and I went shopping didnt get much just a new purse and a ring cuz its awesome LoL. So yeah then that night I babysat for my sweetie pie who wasnt feelin so good. Poor thing. I couldn't get her to eat but I got her to drink a lil bit but then she got up took the bowl with her to the bathroom and then starting barfing. I can handle it. Wow. I didnt even feel like I was gonna get sick or anything. I just pulled her hair outta her face and made her feel better...after that she was okay but yeah. So I guess I passed that test. LoL I can handle little kids n barf...so yeah. Well today not much has been goin on...Ashley came over and we filled out all of our crap for NYE. It took us like 2 hours. But we kinda got sidetracked alot to but yeah. It was fun. Also tonight I've been pissed for alot of reasons but yeah I dont wanna go into them all cuz Im actually feeling alot better now. I really wanna go write a story. Its an odd urge that I have. So yeah. I guess I wrote alot bout junk. So I'll let you all go back to ur normal lives now.......  -Tara
