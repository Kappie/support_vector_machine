I say You never tried To stop the walls  From tumbling down You never tried to help me up when i was down I would have broke through I would have been strong I would have let go If I could Stop the echo of you Running Fast I go Everything I dont want You have What I need Coming back Everywhere I go There you are You ask What did I do? I say You never tried to stop my life From crumbling  You never tried to talk to me When no one was around I would break through I would be strong But I just cant stop the echo of you I walk away Dont leave Im going away Believe me I will stop the echo Of you!
