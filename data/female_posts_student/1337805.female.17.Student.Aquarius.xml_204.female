It was commented yesterday, why we haven't begun to date...He's the perfect boyfriend, we go out on the dates, but there is no commitment.  But I find it hard to try and focus on other guys when all I want his him.  He's not a looker, he's the exact physical opposite of a guy I could love. But he's the best.  Last weekend I thought was the best time I've ever spent with him. Now, yesterday was the best, sitting on that cliff, gazing at the water below, at the Malahat across from us, hot chocolate.. perfect.  He said his friend had asked why aren't we together? And my friends ask the same.  Now that I'm home, and I thought, why not?  Why not?  My heart throbs at each beat thinking of him, laughing in the truck, trying to find our way out of the maze of roads.  I wish we had never left.
