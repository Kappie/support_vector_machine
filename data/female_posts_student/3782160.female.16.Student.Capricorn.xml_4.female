I just wish each passing day was as perfect as each of the 50 thoughts above.The song and the thoughts just go hand in hand for me.Just 1 miracle can make my life as perfect as the thoghts above.Anyways i have been longing to blog since quite sometime now but i wonder why i hadnt done ot for quite some time now.Maybe i just was waiting for the right moment or was looking for something special to put on my 1st blog.But...I guess I couldnt really keep things inside me for so long.I had to put them somewhere.And have just got so used to blogging last few days that its more of an addiction now more than anything else.Anyways just a week more of this and then god knows when i would get a chance to update in school.  My trip to bombay was one of the trips i have ever had.As in though there was nothing really special apart from the fact that it was the last time i was seeing bits before she got married and it was the last time we were getting to spend so much time together maybe.So she did do her best to spend most of the time she could manage with and it did feel nice.Chins and i have always had great fun together so it wasnt any diff this time.She took me shopping all over and our choices are so similar that bits disliked whtever we chose so much and we just laughed it all.hehe...But anyways she was another naucturnal like ME and infact there were times when i failed to give her company to b up till whatever time she was.A few moments i spent in bombay were just so awesome.As in I just look back and I realise i hated the beach,I could never sit in silence,I never really saw the beauty nature possessed.But the two evenings spent at  BAND STAND  and then at  MARINE DRIVE were just so awesome.  25th JUNE(Friday),2004 11.00PM Taking a walk at Juhu beach.The breeze is blowing hard against my face.Bits Romit Chins Sonti and I just taking a walk and all of a sudden when chins romit and i go to have this kairi chaat.It simply rocked!So many memories attached to this place apart from just the yummy pao bhaji.The last time i came here was with DB,Bits.Chins,Sameer Pulkit,Dolly.That trip to bbay was so awesome.Bits DB a few others and I would come to Juhu every single evening and buy gas balloons,tie them all to an empty coke can and just let them loose.I used to be so fascinated by the site as a kid.And Db like a sweet bro would do it each evening just to see me smile.hehe...  This is one thing i always wanna keep a track of-26th JUNE(saturday),2004 7.50PM Today exact....actually just forget it i dont even wanna mention about the person or whteva!The situation was just so  IRONIC .I always thought of sitting at band stand ________ and sitting there for hours together(Bits u know what am talking abt!).________.Today I am finally sitting at Band stand _____-with one of our all time favourites "Tu Aashiqui Hai" playing!The breeze blowing hard agaisnt my face,the sun has almost set and the waves crashing hard against the shore.The sound created by the waves seems so soothing to the ear.What could be better?All old memories come Flooding back just as the waves rushing towards the shore.I want to shed a tear or two but i just hide it all behind a fake laugh.I'm lost in my own world of thoughts.Only if I had _______.It is the most awesome feeling one can ever have.All am asking god for is not to let this moment pass.Just the perfect moment which am trying to hold onto though time is just slipping out of my hands.I just capture the moment in my camera and the memory of this moment wil stay in my heart forever.I just dint know that one could ever feel this way without feeling the need of a companion to share the same feelings.I could just feel something beautiful around me.I just experienced something i have never done before and though the feeling i cant express in words... IT WAS JUST SIMPLY AWESOME! (the blanks(_______)are just few things i dnt wanna recall,i had it store as a note on my phone so just editted it and put it on)  The next day a similar incident takes place.27th JUNE(Sunday),2004 8.00PM I'm sitting at  MARINE DRIVE  with again 1 of my favourites songs  "BHEEGEY HONTH"  playing as soon as i put on FM.Wow!It just feels so good.The feeling just cant be expressed in words.As a smile at times can say much more than a laughter the same way the feeling can not be put down in words it just something which can be felt by the heart!It just made me realise that how nature could just over whelm you by just giving you the perfect moments.This trip to bombay has changed me tremendously.It seems the old aahna has sunk sumwhere down the deep blue sea and all those past memories just dont exist any longer.It feels so much nicer!  Probably thats the reason why i dint want this to end.But ya the change though is there but not a complete change.Maybe thats the reason I wanted a little more time out of this same old place(delhi) to get it all out of my mind.Maybe thats the reason on the last night I was just thinking about stuff and on that day maybe i just wasnt able to hide my emotions.Bits chins could both see it on my face(i have a very transparent face) and kept asking me what was wrong.But what was i to be saying?Coz i myself dint know what was wrong.I myself dint know what thoughts had taken over my mind.Maybe now i know what they were.But yet not sure.Sometimes its so wierd that you just cant figure out about your own life and things just feel so strange.You become a stranger to your own self!  Anyways I can go on writing forever.Maybe i surely can express much better by writing than i can when am talking.Its difficult for people to understand me.And i know i gotto improve my communication skills as i always cant be writing and expressing.As thats what a close friend complains of that i never talk.Now i just dont know what to say to some one who doesnt belong to MAYO.Its so sick.I gotto change this in me.Anyways i have started staying so quiet.I dont understand why.I never was this way.I dont know if others have noticed but I have.I'm hardly able to make conversation with my parents forget any one else.Probably the only one I can express everything is to rasna coz she's aware of everything that goes on in skool as well as at home.But i know the same thing's gonna happen again.Once we get back to skool Rasna n i wont be talking for another %months.And i hate that to happen but it always does happen that rasna n I though best of pals but yet we hardly communicate in skool.We talk much more at home.I am hoping there would be a change this time as things have changed.Though now as days are coming closer i dont feel like going back.I dont know am feeling damn low about going back to skool.Its something that different than the usual feeling i have before going back.I always do feel low but this time there is something more to it and am unable to figure out what it is.  Anyways am supposed to be going to dubai for a three day trip.But for now due to whatever reasons the plan has almost been called off.And am just hating the whole thing.Specially the reason is just pissing off.Its not even something genuine.But i cant do jack about it.I thought of going to chandigarh to meet diya incase i wasnt able to make it to Dubai but cant even do that.So guess gonna be home.But its a nice satisfying feeling altogether to be home.  hm..thats about it.God knows what all i have written.Still have so much to say but gotto put an end na.Probably just wanna thank each one who cares for me and understands me and wanna thank god for another beautiful morning.The sun rise was so beautiful this morn but it might hav just looked better if I was still in bbay.hehe...Next time...Which aint too far just abt 5 more months and then i'll be in bbay again and this time DB is gonna be there.Wow meeting him after ages!Though this time we wouldnt go to juhu and buy balloons but this time's gonna be surely better as we gonna hav so much fun as finally bits n him are tying the knot.Wow!!!  Ciao...I better get going before this blog never ends and Mum and Dad to wake up finding me all crazy being up so all night!hehe....
