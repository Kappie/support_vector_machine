Well I found out that he supposedly kissed my cousin. Great cousin I have huh?   (Large portion of this post deleted at the request of one of my good friends, Gavin. So sorry if it seems like something here is missing. It wasn't my place to write what I wrote and I am sorry to Gavin for it.)   I am just so worried about him and I just want to see him succeed in life and be happy no matter what he does. Did I mention how much I care about him? Because I do so much.  Well, tonight I'm going to HCCC for a college night. I'm going to go check out Oneonta, Le Moyne, Utica, Potsdam, and a couple other colleges. All I know for sure is that I want to be able to play music still and I want to take a class in phsycology and I want to be able to drive home on weekends (maybe).   So right now I'm looking up directions for HCCC and just typing on here. Today started out horrible. I thought I had lost my best friend forever and I couldn't stop thinking at all. After my talk with Carol it got better a little.  I just want to know how the hell I deal with all this drama? When will it all go away?  And I would also like to retract anything I said about the whole Raik thing yesterday. It was completely inappropriate and I was completely wrong. I hope everyone can forgive me for what I did.
