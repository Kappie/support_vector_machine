I can go straight alright but not far b/c my skateboard, which was not purchased by me, came from Wal-Mart of all places...so the bearings suck! And the wheels also suck! So, there ya go..lol. As far as tricks go,...nope, none, nada, don't think so..hehe. yeah! I'd even settle for learning an ollie. I need someone to teach me...
