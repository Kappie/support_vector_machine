Perhaps anger toward something which should be neutral to me, or neutrality toward something that should outrage me.  When I take a step back and examine these feelings that catch me off guard, I often find that my morality /or ethics has been compromised or offended in some way that I would have never seen or believed.    Take for instance a situation with a couple that is friends with my husband and I.  I can honestly say that I am not fond of the male half of the relationship.  He’s overbearing and treats his wife like a subservient piece of meat with absolutely no regard for her feelings or even the fact that she is a person.  My morals are offended already, just talking about it!  He would rather sleep and play video games than spend time with her and if she gets fed up with it and picks up a book he accuses her of not spending time with him.  Selfish doesn’t even begin to cover it!  She cooks for him and he won’t eat it, then wakes her up in the middle of the night to make him a sandwich, a damned sandwich!  He’s cold and irrational and believes a wife is a sex toy!  I have never really been fond of him, even before they got married, I had always thought he was a bit… oh I don’t know what the word is, he was just so damned nerve grindingly annoying!  Take her, she and I get along really well, mostly.  She’s a bit too willing to put up with his shit.  A little too willing to let him treat her like she's a sex slave.  It’s nearly aggravating to no end!  The whole situation just makes me want to scream!    Okay, now onto how this example would betray my sense of ethics and morality.  I feel like they could not possibly love one another.  To love is to see in another soul what you are in the depths of your own.  To love is to connect with a kindred spirit, another person who can see you.  A true love is a person who can walk through the walls around your heart as if they were never there at all.  To love is the most profound sense of self, in the deepest sense of your own life.  To be in love is to have a person who you are not complete without.  A true lover is a person who would leave an irreplaceable emptiness within your soul if they were ever lost to you.    So if they are not in love then why does she put up with him?  Why would he stay?  If they are in love then I wonder why I like her at all.  Under the above definition of love, because I dislike him so, how could I truly like her at all?  I see her not doing anything for herself in the situation and it offends a deep part of my soul in a way that I could never explain in words.  It makes me angry that I would waste my time with someone who refuses to do something so profoundly basic for him or herself.  I only want my friends to be happy, truly happy, not some weak shadow of pleasure with life.   I really don’t believe it’s too much to ask.  I suppose that I grow more and more aware of my own sense of morality by the day.  I never doubt from where my morals are formed and how they have been influenced over time.  I believe in God and know that he will guide my in making my moral decisions.    Still, I sigh at some situations around me and wish and pray that I could do something to change them, to make them better, or at least help them in some way.  Yet the world is an expecting one, fully of political correctness and lies.  That by itself offends my morality and ethics.  Niceties offend my ethics, political correctness and everything that it implies offends me to no end.  My husband said to me the other day, “Aren’t you tired of always being nice?  Doesn’t it feel fake?”  To which I answered an unequivocal “Yes!”  Still, being a Christian teaches us to be tolerant with the world and those around us.  I can be tolerant, only so long as my own morals and ethics are not severely compromised.  ~Kristyn
