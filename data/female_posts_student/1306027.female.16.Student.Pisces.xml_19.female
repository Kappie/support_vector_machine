I mean, when you ask someone nicely to do something, aren't they even the least obligated to do it, especially if they are getting paid for doing that thing or some thing(s) that you have asked them to do?!?! I mean, ok so new people are a tad clueless, I know I was as a new person- but at least I was willing to learn how to do something. And then do it.  I guess I can't complain anymore- I don't work there! AHAHA- Freedom. My summer job is officially over, this is the official documentation proof I do know that I'll be missed.... I was just starting to reach my experienced employee stance.    Enough with the bragging  So I finally got finished redecorating my room,  Almost . It is so(o x 100) awesome!I mean- For a middle class white girl's room it is pretty sweet. I better describe it before you die of curiosity.   Once you walk through the door the the first thing you'll see is  The Movie/Music wall- Posters galore. Here you will see some movie and music posters on a corner like section of the wall.   And to the side we have  The reading spot- Over here we have a black mosquito net hanging down from the ceiling... cool, I know. And inside the net we have a papasan chair (o la la) so comfortable and such, I fell asleep in it last night. Also, On the wall inside the mosquito net there is a display of my art and a Barnes n nobles bag with a buncha classic books on it. It also has this name plaque thingy that says my name and why I'm so great...lol. There are also some bamboo porch lights hanging from the ceiling providing some much needed light.   Moving on  Once you walk away from the magnificent chair(if you have the will power to get your butt up that is), you will see my little tribute to Zen corner. Over here we have a cherry wood dresser with stick-like handles, a bamboo lamp, a Zen garden with a masterful design, and a plaque with a Chinese character representing tranquility.    Now if you'll please look up and to the right   You'll see my kimono poster (fetish i acquired from my Aunt, who happened to live in Japan for 2 years) with Japanese character plaques on either side... one says faith, and the other says ambition. Hanging from the wall over here is this nifty little Origami thing I bought at my hometowns yearly festival.    Take a U-turn(driver's ed speak)   Now your facing the bed, newly complete with a spiffy dragon bedspread(Black N White). On the headboard resides a new stereo system- It changes color as the music plays- isn’t that awesome?!   Lastly- You'll see  The black curtains that allow me to sleep during the day.    And with that my room is done...almost.   Tomorrow is the first day of my sophomore life  And to think, I have to travel all the way to my kitchen to start it. The line up this year seems weak in comparison to last year's line up. Physics, AP American History, Algebra II, Honors English, and Advanced Lit. Ok, so maybe this year isn't going to be so  easy .  But hey- gotta get that expierence if I'm gonna get into an Ivy League or it's equivalent. Don't read this and think- O it's another brain child who spontanously generates A's and goes through life being worshipped and will make a booku amount of bucks. No  I work very hard and not enough people seem to respect that. I'm not stuck up and I don't flaunt my accomplishments here and there and everywhere. *sigh* Some people don't understand.   I’m tired and I have some more reading to do- The Fountain Head. I suggest you read it... that book rocks my socks.
