I want more people to visit sites like  urlLink www.freedonation.com/hunger/ and  urlLink http://www.feedthechildren.org/ and  urlLink http://www.wvi.org/ and  urlLink http://www.give.org/  . It would be great if more people donated money to such great causes, but there areplenty of other ways to help!!It's important forus to care!!However, it is not my choice. It is yours. Please visit those sites to helpend hunger  poverty,promote education, supportart,protect the environment  animals, preserve our land, and much much more. We can all help!! Take action!
