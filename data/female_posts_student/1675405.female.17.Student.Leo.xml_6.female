Heather wasn't at the game, so I had to sit with my fellow saxophonists and I was ready to cry I was so upset. No one would talk to me past 2nd quarter, and I'm really really frustrated! WHY? That's all I want to know, because believe me, if I knew I would fix it. I'm really tired of always getting left out of everything by everyone.  Marie's obsessed with John and wants to hook back up. John doesn't. They both tell me what they really think, but I'm too afraid to tell the other, but know I should to save each from humiliation. But I don't have the heart to break anyone's hopes!  Me, well, things for me have just been peachy. I absolutely love the fact that I have friends who really care about me, who will stop talking about themselves for one freaking moment and ask me how my day went, or how am I today.
