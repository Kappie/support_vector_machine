Had a short breakfast and after which, we went to SAC. Miss See kept saying stuff bout wat cheese, meat and watever... It was very boring and i kept yawning, hopeing she'll notice. Haha.. Jason, Hong Guan and Kheng Wei fell asleep until she woke em up wif tat loud voice over the mic. Lolx...  After the 'torturing' session, we(chunseng, ivan, yipeng, po tiong, junrong, jianqiang, zhanyuan, guowei, jianlong and me) went to play basketball at the court near the school's bus stop. I had great fun although my team lost by a close points of 19-21. Haiz.. Time really flies. It seemed like yesterday when i jus came back from school to start 'holiday-ing'.. But now.. HaiZ!! 4 more days left.. Oh ya, talking bout yesterday, ron and jianlong came 2 my house 2 play PC, PS2 and watch Naruto. Naruto is a really nice anime tat i'd introduce to anyone. Yesterday i watched World Idol too. Tat Kurt Nilsen won in de end! Oh man. I was supporting Kelly Clarkson and Will Young. But Kurt managed to get full points(10, except for own country 12) for almost ALL the countries! He got a total of 106 points with Kelly in the runnerup with 97 points. Geez.. He sang okay to me. But not *THAT* appealing. He dont even have the looks.. Haiz.. Spent my holiday soo fast. As usual. >_  P.S: Both quotes in this post r from Naruto and sorry, the first one is pretty long. But meaningful. ^^  P.S2: Soo many people have bloggies now... Jus look at de links there! WoW!    Naruto   Quote: Flesh wounds bleed, and they may seem painful. But as time goes by, the pain eventually disappears. And if you use medicine, it will heal even faster. But the tricky ones are the ones in your heart. Those are difficult to heal. A wound of the heart is different from a flesh wound. Unlike a flesh wound, there are no ointments to heal it, and there are times when they never heal. But there is one thing that can heal a wound of the heart. It's a troublesome medicine and you can only receive it from another person. The thing that can heal a wound of the heart is  Love . Quote 2: Love is the spirit of devoting yourself to someone important or close to you. It is expressed by caring for and protecting that person.
