But yeah lol that was kinda random there lol... You know what we have this new director, Mr.Downs... well hes a pretty cool guy but i've noticed that hes been starring at me and is always watching me..(kinda freaky) then he gives me this half smile/grin then walks away... i cant wait for this weekend so that i can get out and relax before the real stress kicks in next week. For those who were or are in band, we do this excercise to stretch out sides and turn our shoulders flat against the "side lines"... but newayz well we learned a new way to do this and we have to hold out arms out to the sides in "airplane" style and keep them up throughout the entire excercise... geeze i thought my shoulders were gunna fall off afterwards lol im not jokin it hurt... i mean i have enough problems with my shoulders and crap its like what more can i do to screw em' up...welp im runnin out of things to say for the moment so yeah im leavin..  Rock On!!!
