Parents are having a bit of a freakout with me, never fun, while my baby brother (ha!) is in the foullest and most grotesque mood known to man...  Ah well, /ignore mayhem around self! hehe.  Stayed at Chris' house then Alison's house recently, which was ver' fun, and we saw Spiderman 2, which I deeply recommend to those underprivileged souls who have not yet seen it. Also walked through a thunderstorm, and that, also, is most sincerely recommended (apart from lightning risks of course...) Got soaked to the skin and arrived back at Christina's with our clothes apparently glued to our skin!! Hehe twas ver' amusing though!  Queen off now, listening to "Shout!" by the Isley Brothers. ver' good!  Anyway, intended to write something deep, philisophical and totally unconnected to my boring life, but cannae... brain *appears* (:p now you just look stupid!) to have fried, so bye!
