The girls are finishing school tomorrow and they are trilled...they start day camp and our summer fun begins.  A week in Cobourg, Ontario and one in St-Andrew by the sea in New Brunswick plus all kinds of smaller trips here and there.  I have also completed 2 modules, 8 exams to my Relaxation Therapist Course and my average is 87 %...  yippy.... I have so many plans with this.    I will be back tomorrow and hopefully I can upload some pictures of the girls playing soccer....If you know how to do it from here... please let me know.    OK this is it for now and I will be back.... so is Arnold...  Night Night and...........Be Good
