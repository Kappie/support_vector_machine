We all did. The park was absolutely packed with families-kids, dogs and food vendors. We listened to a band called,  The Fish Heads . It's a bluegrass band. They are awesome! Nick played on my lap for an hour without fussing! He smiled, danced, and even sang! Nick Sings! He really likes looking at dogs and babies that look similar to him. It was sooooo much fun. Next Tuesday Keely and Nick and I are going back to hear Beatles music. This early afternoon Keely and I took Nick down to the lakewalk and there was a huge boat coming in. So, Keely and I walked fast and found a spot along the crowed pier. The boat blew its loud horn and I said something to Keely about I hope that doesn't hurt Nick's ears. The spot we found was not so conveniently located under the bridge so when the bridge answered the boat by whistling back, Nick cried. It was one of those scared out of his mind cries. The type that break my heart. But, it didn't last long...10 seconds maybe. I took him out of his stroller and held him as the boat went by.    Nick's weight update...19.5 pounds.
