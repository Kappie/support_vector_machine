Hip hooray another Birthday day, Over the hill you slowly climb, A shot of tequila and a squirt of lime, From cows to trucks, You live your life, Not giving a care to a duck, Enjoying, Loving, Another Birthday and another year, Added to your file up there, Up there in the sky above, A place that is full of Birthday love.  Hope you had a great birthday. Love you. Happy belated B'Day
