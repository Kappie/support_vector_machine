As I was driving back towards the house, I looked up at the sky.  It looked alot like the photo above.  My eyes lit up and I just started grinning from ear to ear; whenever I see a sunbeam like that in the sky, I think of it as God's little way of saying hello.  I felt silly for being in such a bad mood, and it was as if God was opening up the sky and saying, "Why are you so upset?"  The photo, by the way, is from  urlLink here .
