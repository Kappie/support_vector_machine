Today- well... simply put I'll say that a certain someone I know was annoying the living hell out of me! I won't say why, or what they did- it'll give it away. But damn, that girl was annnnoying.  I'm excited for Friday night. Last dance as a Langley girl! And today was our last block of FRENCH and MATH! So I'm in a really good mood. Also not to mention that I'm basically living outdoors now, preserving my sanity before the damn cicada's come out. I'm not a bug person- I'll say that now, and I have to admit I'm somewhat nervous about the giant bugs.  What's up with the guys and that stupid hit the penguin game? I just remembered that. I swear, everytime I walk into a computer room that's what they're doing. And it's not just one of their obsessions, it's like half the grade has gone hit-the-penguin crazy. Got enough blood? Actually- Got spare time? jkjk. Whatevr, you guys were even teaching the kid who visited to play!... talk about corruption. Aiiiiiii.  May 17- First day of exams May 18- FOB's New EP comes out. May 24- AssAteaGue! June 4- Graduation.  Time is gonna fly. I have a confession to make. 'I will remember you' came on the radio today. I started tearing. I'm gonna miss you guys.  Out for the night. -Darcy
