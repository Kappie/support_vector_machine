Just s o all of you don’t think I am a rotten wife to my soldier husband, everything that has happened to me I have openly shared with him. He understands that I am just looking for people to talk to and that I cant find that comfort with our friends because they always seem to be too preoccupied with themselves to listen to anyone else but themselves. Friday night I went out with my friend Dale, who if you remember has been having relationship issues and was the cause of all of my stress a little while back. I took him out to eat and then took him to one of Jesse and mine talking spots, I told him I wanted to take him somewhere Jesse and I frequented just to watch the sun set. We sat there and talked a long time. I told him about how I was doing and how I felt about this whole situation, a lot of it I needed to get off of my chest. There were some things he told me that I don’t think/ remember I said from the night I went to his apartment and drank a little too much (Just so you all who don’t know are aware, Dale is Jesse and mine gay friend and is just about the only guy, besides Ron and Paul who are also both gay, that I hang out with). I asked my friend Jack, who lives in another state, whom I was also on the phone with during the time if such things were supposedly said and he told me that I didn’t say anything like what Dale told me I said. I know this is confusing probably to read, and believe me it is very confusing when I think about the whole thing. Today I spoke to Jesse about the whole thing and he said not to worry about it because Dale was drinking that night and he has a tendency to say things happened that didn’t. I told Jesse that I love him very much and he knows that if I could I would move the stars and the earth for him, just to be with him in Kuwait. Because I don’t remember much from that night I have to wonder what all I said to Dale, Ron (who were both there) and Jack (via phone). Supposedly Ron is going to call and talk to me about the whole thing but I am still waiting for that call and I doubt it will ever happen.  Anyway once again the reason why I am not going to be drinking anything until Jesse comes back.
