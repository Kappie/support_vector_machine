We heard about this palce called paradise and so we decided to go their. First let me tell you that earlier in the day I went to Walmart. Walmart is my favorite place in port.  Uma and I went there to pick up panty hose and we ate in the McDonald's there. I had a McPechuga sandwich. Hahaha. It was a spicy chicken sandwich but the entire menu was in spanish. I don't know how but often I forget I am in a foreign country. Moments like these in McDonald's quickly remind me. Anyway, Paradise was beautiful.  The most tropical restaurant i have been too. it was in the plaza area of Acapulco. In th emiddle of the restaurant (which was all outside and open on the beach), there was this huge bungee jump station.  We order pina colodas and ate some wonderful food while watching crazy people take the plunge of death. It was crazy cool. We took a lot of pictures and as promised they will be coming soon - almost done with the roll!   LISA and KIM are my new friends. They are awesome. We all blend very well. Kim is from Holland and wants Lisa (Lizaki as the greeks nicked her) and I to visit while on vacation.  Lizaki and I are thinking of vacationing together a bit. She wants ot come to Texas so maybe you will get to meet here. Think Pam Anderson. That's what she looks like. Gorgeous girl but breaKing hearts all around the ship. This girl is freaKing cool as shit. All the canadian girls adopted me last night. I am now canadian. Hehehe.  I have to run.  If you have left me a voicemail, I will call once I am in San Diego on Monday. Love you bunches. Shelly
