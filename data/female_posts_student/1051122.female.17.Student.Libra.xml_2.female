By the way, I'm firmly convinced that it should be considered treason to write this kind of filth.  "Ashcroft has been incessantly attacked on the op-ed page of the New York Times by the same columnists who are now angrily demanding to know why the Bush administration didn't imprison all Arabs before Sept. 11. He has been compared to the Taliban. (And you're not a patriot in this war until a liberal has compared you to the Taliban.)"  "Like everything liberals oppose but don't have a good argument for, all reasonable national security measures are called "unconstitutional." Whenever liberals are losing on substance, they pretend to be upset about process."  "While undermining victory in the Cold War, liberals dedicated themselves to mainstreaming Communist ideals at home... Betraying the manifest national defense objectives of the country is only part of the left's treasonous scheme. They aim to destroy America from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and the truth. (p. 289)"  Oh, yeah. Let's destroy America! Hey, people! Where are your liberal grenades? WHAT?! You lent them to HALLIBURTON?!!  "Whether they are defending the Soviet Union or bleating for Saddam Hussein, liberals are always against America. They are either traitors or idiots, and on the matter of America's self-preservation, the difference is irrelevant. Fifty years of treason hasn't slowed them down. (p. 16)"  Fifty years of Treason? If treason includes making sure that a bunch of fat pot bellied men don't take over the world, then bring treason on! *snorts* MANIFEST NATIONAL DEFENSE OBJECTIVES, indeed.  "McCarthy's fundamental thesis was absolutely correct: The Democratic Party had fallen to the allures of totalitarianism. It was as if the Republicans had been caught in bed with Hitler. (p. 71)"  Now we get to my favorite part here; this is where Ann Coulter idolizes McCarthy. This is the same bastard who ruined thousands of lives and kind of ruined the country, but he wasn't a liberal! He must be great! Bitch! How DARE she?!  "When the Democrats' bluff was called in a roll call vote in Congress, many voted for war with Iraq. Inadvertently performing a great service, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd revealed the Democrats' treasonous calculations. She explained that Democrats would be forced to fake enthusiasm for the war on terror or lose the American people forever. Democrats, she said, "fear that if they approach" Iraq the same way they did during the Gulf War in 1991, "they will be portrayed as McGovernite wimps." Consequently, liberals would lie and pretend to support America. With their votes duly recorded, they went right back to attacking the war. (p. 14-15)"  While Maureen Dowd is not the nicest person in the world, I have yet to see her condemn every conservative in the world as having committed treason. Dowd might be petty, but there is a line where she stops and rarely crosses. Coulter on the other hand, has no problem discrediting actual achievements of people based solely on the fact that she does not LIKE them, as can be seen here:  "Carter would travel to Norway to accept the award in December 2002 - two months after Congress had authorized war against Iraq. Article III's definition of treason is narrow. But after Congress's action authorizing war, for any American to accept this award on the ground offered does sound terribly like "adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort." (p. 257)"  Yes. Carter has actually helped people and done more than you ever have to help anyone else. Carter has saved lives, and Coulter has caused grief. Let's see. Who's the better person? I'm thinking here -  Oh, Clod. She is, indeed, a horrible person.
