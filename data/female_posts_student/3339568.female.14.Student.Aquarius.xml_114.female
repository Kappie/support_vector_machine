Hav a look at the pic of it, and change it to T1 and Luke struggling on the bottoms next 2 a swing, and Monty on top fiddling with the swing chain. Hehe, it was funny. Now there's a Kodak moment 4 you. Isn't it a shame we didn't have that camera on us...  They would have made good cheerleaders...  Shame really  Haha
