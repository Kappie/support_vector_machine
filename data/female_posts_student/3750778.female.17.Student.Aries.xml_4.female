I have come to the conclusion that people are generally just plain stupid, and that is why we have to look our best and take pictures to show it off(not like mine are gunna be any good or anything). So while I wait I am gunna rant about how superficial people generally are. Why do we have to look good? I have no problem looking like a slob and going out in public, I do it all the time. But to some people if they see someone looking grundgy they think that that person is poor or stupid or something. Just because I don't feel like taking 30 minutes out of my day to fix my hair or put on make-up or pick out cute clothes doesn't mean I am poor and it doesn't mean that I don't care about myself. It just means that I don't care what other people think and maybe I just don't feel like it! hmm I feel better now. Hee, well I am off the see the wizard, wish me luck!
