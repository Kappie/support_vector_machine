I felt awkward cause I was so quiet..But I guess it doesn't matter. He invited me to go for a walk with him downtown to get a drink, so of course I accepted. But with my 2am curfew about 10 minutes away, I knew I was either going to be very late, or I should just invite him to my house.    I love his flirting methods, they're so cute. When we were walking, we both kept bumping into each other as an excuse to hold hands. It was cute and sweet and made me smile with delight. This bumping shoulders also became and excuse to start a passionate kiss, right on the sidewalk! We got into it and couldn't stop, he tasted so good. His lips are gorgeous and delicious and I can't help but kiss him and kiss him, every chance I get. We were finally interrupted by the sounds of drunkards wandering the streets.   So we snuck into my house and worked our way through foreplay to sex. I was nervous and self-conscious about myself and my ability to be completely honest. It also didn't help that my parents were in the house, above us.    But then again it was our first time together, it's a new body with new likes and dislikes and it's hard to master someone in one sitting! But there's another aspect of me that is really self-conscious, where I feel like he actually wasn't having a good time, but was just being polite. I am deathly afraid he doesn't actually like me and just wants sex. However he hasn't quite displayed that complete mind set. He has been very sweet and he cuddled a little after sex. But I still feel he is one of those completely polite guys who thought he was interested in me, but after having bad sex with me, in uninterested. Maybe I'm worrying too much. But I can't read him, it's so difficult to tell if he's being truthful.   I'm also scared that he went back to sheila's and told everyone how horrible it was. Thinking about all of this makes me even more self-conscious. Maybe I'm not very good at sex, I thought I was...But....   I really wanted to pleasure him and I really wanted him to cum...But it wasn't happening through sex, so he asked me to trying sucking him. But it didn't seem like I was doing it right, he wanted me to go as deep as possible, to use tighter lips, and to play with his balls. And even though I tried meeting these requests I don't think it worked. I suppose I could argue that it was our first time and we need to get to know each other's pleasure requirements...But I felt bad because I wasn't masterful.    So we switched back to sex again, of course the problem is he has to pull out...So that can be argued as an underlying reason for his prolonged cumming. But why do I still feel it was my crappy ability that was the problem? Am I really bad? I'm kind of upset now. Maybe he doesn't want to try with me again. Oh man, maybe I'm just being too drastic, but I'm so scared!   I really want to see him again and I can't wait to show him what I'm made of on Saturday. But I wonder what his intentions are? Does he want to just "see" each other and have sex and a friendly relationship? Does he want a relationship? Or does he just want to fuck, cause he's decided he doesn't like me or my body?   I've been reading sex tips since I got up...I want to hit him hard with some really good sex on Saturday, so I'm shaping up. :P   Apparently he's calling before 5...Thinking of work - I have to clean my uniform and I'm probably going to be working upstairs tonight. Damnit! I'm going to be pooched. I want to talk to Sheila...See what went down when he left my house for Sheila's. Did him and Juan go home? Did they stay till 5am? Did Danielle and Stef hook up or flirt or talk about how bad I am? I need to talk to Sheila. I'm sure things aren't as bad as I think, but I can't help but worry.   I can't stop thinking about it.   I wonder what he's doing tonight...I think practicing with the band? Who knows. I wish I could see him, but I've dated musicians before and it's not cool to interrupt band bonding sessions. Not that I care that he practices, I'm glad he's playing his bass. It's just that I'm selfish and want him all to myself to give him a real taste of my real skills. I can be quite crazy and fun, so I'm told and I know I can show him a good time. I just have to build myself up a bit, I suppose.      Anyways, off to prepare for work.      I'll write again.
