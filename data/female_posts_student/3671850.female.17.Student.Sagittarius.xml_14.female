I'm trying really hard to get out of it, but I'm just toooo frustrated for words right now.  On a lighter note, school wasn't tooo bad today.. no wait, yes it was, Mrs. Cannon assigned 40 new homework problems.  Considering I didnt completely understand the previous 20 AND it took me 2 hrs to do 20... I cant WAIT to do these 40 something, joy.    Pew, pew .  I only saw  Chad  for like 2 seconds today so I didnt get to talk to him :( , but thats okay ~ Just adds to my wonderful outlook on life as a senior :( I really miss talking to him.  I did get to spend my day with Jess though because we have EVERY class together on Bdays... and i can live with that.  Today I went to school, went with Kellie to pick up Austin, started Calculus, ate and ran... exciting.. i know.   Okay, I'm finished  complaining , sorry about that.  Song of the day:  I Miss You  ~Blink 182  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight  I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides  like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me  you're already the voice inside my head   (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
