But met up w/ three of them at the stairs then at the escalator. And someone else went into stalking mode, too. Seriously. She's obsessed. Like crazy stalkerish.   Wtf?!?!?! I don't understand this.. Are we friends or are we not? We act like friends.. Then again, I don't know. What does he want us to be? Seriously, I'm so confused.. Why must guys always tease me? I can never figure out things when they're chasing me or vice-versa. I'll watch very closely during the next beachness. Hopefully I'll be able to figure out something.
