I told her no, I don't like him, I love him. She went on to tell me how she and her bf used to be like that, they went out for a year. One day she was joking and said I don't know if I love you, and he was like yea I know, I like you only as a friend, I think we should break up! She said that he was the first to say he loved her...just like Brandon. Also she said that her bf wrote poems to her telling her how he feels about her....just like Brandon. So one day he loved her, the next he realized he liked her just as a friend. But, the thing is, they aren't friends. For me to hear this is totally devastating because I love Brandon so much and I would never think him do something like this, but...it's possible. I know that earlier in my blog I said that I shouldn't worry so much because it does me nothing good. But, what if? Wow I really don't know what to do. I mean I don't want to think about these things when things between me and Brandon have just started! How confused I am right now, you do not know. Like I said, my life is confusing. But, let this be a lesson to everyone. You realize how much you love someone after you have lost them. I mean, I'm not saying that I don't love Brandon, but wow this is crazy. I need to talk with Brandon, I could never imagine our love ending like that, and I don't want it to.
