Everything was ok ....I was happy today which is a good change of pace from my regular mood lately! But there is always some one who will ruin your day.... For me this was my mom...She is like always up on me about shiznit and im so tired of it ....Today after school she tells me I need to ride the bus home which aint happening! No way! So I get a ride from a friend...And then another friend of mine and a friend ofmy friend needs a ride ...... So ok both of us get a ride..... but my friend cant take my other friend home cause he lives in the middle of nowhere so I say he can come to my house until his original ride can pick  him up but of course my mom has a problem with that but I do it any way but try not to get caught ....But of course I did and now im grounded!!!! And thats about it totally gay!!!!!!!! you know what crap im mad soo..... you know bye!!!
