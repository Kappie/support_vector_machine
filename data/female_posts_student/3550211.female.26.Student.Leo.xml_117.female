A friend of hers went on a date last night with somebody she met of this site, and evidently had a fabulous time. They hit it right off. The sparks flew. Instant match.   Excuse me as I gag.  Seriously though, her question has led to me ponder,  just what do I think of romance on the internet ? Can it really work? And if so, for how many?   There is a part of me that thinks in a world such of ours, one that is filled with technology, that yes, of course online dating can and will be successful. However, there is also a part of me that is very skeptical. Well, maybe skeptical isn't the word I'm looking for. It's more like, online dating, gives me a bad taste in my mouth. It's like a small part of me still views it with distaste.    "Oh.  You  had to meet  somebody  online, huh?" [Turning to other friends to laugh.] " How pathetic."   Please don't misunderstand me. I know this isn't true. I know that online dating is very popular. And in fact, logically, I have nothing against it. It's just that I still have this stereotype set in  my head. And truth be told, I've met people from websites such as myspace, and friendsters, so I'm not against the entire process. The difference in meetings, however, was that I didn't harbor any romantic notions. I didn't expect to meet the love of my life, I was simply meeting friends. Which, by the way, was a success on almost all accounts.   But, I'm a clever girl and I realize that, yes, I have a negative and perhaps unfair perception about online dating. The truth of the matter is, who am I to say that it won't work. It is for that reason, I told my friend to try it. WHY NOT? One of my personal philosophies is to try anything, at least once. How will you know whether it is a success or failure, if you don't at least try.  Right?
