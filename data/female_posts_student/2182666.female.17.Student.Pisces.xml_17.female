Britney Spears 'the things i did weren't cool'" haha ohh man.. im not going to go there.  today was fun. in chem we made peanut brittle with the peanuts I bought at 6 45 this morning. it was wonderful. in english we're watching RADIO. i have no idea why we are watching it but im definately not complaining. spanish was better today.. ohh wait, that was a lie.  mr. matysiak made fun of my purse today after school. he kept saying peace and groovy and how hip it is.. lol so i bought a new one.  ok so sometimes you hear things you wish you didnt.. like after school when andrew said that john mayer is hot and he would do him. he's mormon too.. that has to be illegal or something.  ok so not being able to use AIM is KILLING me.. i seriously did not think it would be this bad and it's only the second night.. lol i dont think im going to be able to do this. seriously though.. call me to help me take my mind off of AIM. alright well im gonna hit the shower. bye guys. yall are amazing!!  j co
