By the way, She, I changed my mind.. Instead of uploading it to the Golden Sushi site like I said in the email, I uploaded it to your space. The actual URL of the picture is  http://www.goldensushi.net/~she/nokncam.jpg . Once you get your FTP program installed, you can upload more pictures to your personal space and link to them in the same manner.    DAF, your "crooked nose" post makes me think of Owen Wilson (of  Shanghai Noon ,  Zoolander ,  Behind Enemy Lines  fame). It's his signature look!    My biggest abnormality is my greenish mole on my right arm. It's huge! I think it's gotten bigger as I've grown older. Thankfully, it's not cancerous!
