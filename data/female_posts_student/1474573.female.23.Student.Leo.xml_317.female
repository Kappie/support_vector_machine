The seven or 8 cab drivers honking at you for a ride in the minute it takes when you're waiting to cross the dang street. 5.  The music blasting out of houses and cars and the kids on the street until all hours of the night the moment the temperature goes above 70 degrees.  Things I love about Washington Heights: 1.  You can ALWAYS get a cab. 2.  Platanos are like, 6 for a dollar, yo! 3.  I know my way around and where to get the best a) chancletas, b) mangu, and c) cuban sammiches. 4.  My grandmother lives there and she's really cute. 5.  You can get your hair blown out for like, a dollar, an' shit.  And they do it RIGHT.  I'm on the fence about the fact that I woke up to a ROOSTER crowing on 173rd Street and Audubon Avenue... Those fuckers dont let up until the whole friggin' WORLD is awake!  I felt like I was on a farm.  Actually I think I dreamt that.    I realized yesterday that I truly grew up in the little Dominican Republic.  Half the people cant speak English, the food is great, and there are ROOSTERS in the friggin' back of buildings as if we were in  el campo .  What's funnier is that, as anxious as I was about taking care of my grandmother, I never feel weird going back to the old 'hood.  I actually kinda miss it sometimes... Shhh!  Dont tell anyone!
