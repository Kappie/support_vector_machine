It also gives me the chance to relearn my abilities with HTML.  I had the idea of completely designing the thing in Photoshop then, with a small bit of cheating with Imageready, do the HTML myself. It's so much easier having the end result right there to refer to. It's probably not an original idea, but it was for me.  I am still adjusting to my new name, but I think I'm going to stick with it.
