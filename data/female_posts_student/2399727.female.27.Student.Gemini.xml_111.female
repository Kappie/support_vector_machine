I think I shall do what my mom did.  Decide on two things and flip a coin.  Heads or tails.  No other factors like loans or fear or vocation.  That easy.    ... Just did it.  It came up Theology.  I can either analyze it to death or just submit the damned application already.    ***** Having some troublesome realizations about D.  My first experience with  urlLink agape love , so an expert on the subject tells me.   He thinks I should be honest, but I think I would rather poke out my good eye with a dull spoon.    ***** Why do I find it so hard to believe that I could be loveable?  ***** Coming to realize I don't like the expression "good eye" anymore, because in essence, it has been a very, very bad eye.  I think I shall use the term "dominant eye" from now on.  ***** Watched  urlLink Intolerable Cruelty  last night.   Absolutely rentable.  George Clooney is hot as always.  Website has cute quizzes on whether or not you are compatible with your mate.  ***** Reading Richard Rohr's "Job and the Mystery of Suffering" (1996).   A little heady but not impenetrable.  ***** Just because it says "buffet" you shouldn't take that to mean "all you can gorge yourself on" as  urlLink this couple  discovered.  Not that I'm sure I'd ever actually eat at a place called " urlLink Chuck-A-Rama ".     ***** Came across this  urlLink Disability Etiquette Handbook from Oklahoma  yesterday.  Contains some very valuable tips in addition to some "duh" statements.  ***** More to come...
