That means I can't go to school, work, or anything. And my step mom was already a $%$#@% this morning! This is honestly too much for me now. I have lost all confidence in everything I do. I can't get  job, I can't afford to insure Speedy Reidy, I can't do barely anything. Why does this hapen now? Why during the time where you should be happy? I hate this a lot. It's so hard to go anywhere with a smile now and just put everything behind. I've already hanled so much crap, i don't want to go through anymore.
