Sad because it means I have to leave Matt and the cat and people here.  So according to Adam I'm an "alcohologist."  Well, not me, in particular, but archaeologists in general.  Interesting to see how we're viewed by the other subdisciplines.  Ah well.  That really doesn't characterize me, given my general lack of drinking, but I suppose I know a lot of people to whom such a label would apply.    I'm working on a paper on volcanic eruptions and human evolution.  I have realized that one of the generally accepted viewpoints is totally wrong.  But that's okay.  Gives me something to write about, I suppose.  Too bad I'm not the only one to notice that or I could try to get something published.  I want publications!!!!!  Okay, no more procrastinating.  Back to the volcano articles...
