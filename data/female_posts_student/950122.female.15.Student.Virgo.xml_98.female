We got there early tho, so I was able to go to a comic shop! I bought the first manga of Gravitation. :P At the theater, my parents and my brother watched Troy, while Maelle and I watched Mean Girls. It was pretty funny. Our movie ended an hour before Troy did, (we even started before they did) so we had to get picked up early. After that, I hung out with Maelle's neighbors. They had a bonfire, and it was pretty cool, considering bonfires I'm familiar with usually has my dad burning a grass field near our house. :O Anyway, we had smores and watched them play Mortal Kombat 3. SNES. Hmmm.  We leave for Hawaii next week, May 19th. Then we go back to the Philippines probably on May 26th-28th, and before I go back to school, we're going to Iriga! O_o Still a lot of travelling in store for me..
