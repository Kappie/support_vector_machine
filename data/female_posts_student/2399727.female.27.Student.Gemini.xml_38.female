My parents came by with a lighter winter coat for me and some gauze to do my eye scrubs.  I bought some salt yesterday.  My eye is already beginning to feel better but the vision is fairly poor.  Grading is done.  I need to drop them off by about 10am tomorrow but the instructor is being quite lenient so if I sleep in, I will not be concerned.    Finished reading/skimming six Robertson Davies plays.  No references but they were enjoyable.  I picked up his complete first trilogy for perusal this week.  Apparently  A Mixture of Frailities  will be the one that will be most useful.  Going to rest and watch TV this afternoon.  I'm very tired.  More to come...
