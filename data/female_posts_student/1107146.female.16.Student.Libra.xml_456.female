I'm still puzzled as to why he hasn't gone and be'd a loser and sprung that shit up already. Not that we've met him...he doesn't even come to the door to get my mom, he calls from behind tinted windows on a cell phone. My mom says the reason we haven't met him is so that "You don't get too attached in case things don't work out." I mean...ok. We'll get attached, sure, because I have, let's see...no girlfriend? Nope, I've got Abby...no friends? Naw, lots of good friends...no biological father around? Hmm, I've got that too...so THAT, friends, is exactly why I would become attached to him and the separation anxiety would simply be too much for me and lead me to death.  ...  It's all just so dumb.  Well I didn't go to school today. Hoo-ah! I've been under influence of Quil du Ni all day, and it was wonderful. Great for dreamless sleep. I'm pretty sure I'm already biologically addicted and I'll die without it tonite, but I already feel pretty durn good, altho the acetaminophen takes a long time to wear off with me, so I dunno if I'm actually better or the drugs and doing what the bloody hell they're supposed to be doing.   I watched  The Two Towers  today...:in a word, "Eh." In another, "It's alright." And another, "It was ok." Perhaps another, "I've seen much better." Et cetera. Ok, all that BS to say, yes it was dynamic and huge and totally captured the feel of the book...shakily in places, as it always has done...but...the acting in this one wasn't half as good as in  The Fellowship of the Ring . Maybe since Ian McKellen wasn't around all of them at the same time to whip their asses into shape, because he is an ass-bad soldier. But eek...it was some rough acting. And what happened to the battle sequences? Yah they were large scale and heads rolled and stuff...but they still paled in comparison with the first one. I think that with this movie, they aimed for size, and boy-o-boy did they get it. If not anything else, there's a lot of frickin' extras in this mofo.  Well...I'm going to go do something else to waste my time.  Here's lookin' at you, kids.
