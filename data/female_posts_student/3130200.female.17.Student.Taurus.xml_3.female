I thought all the scheduled speakers tonight did exceptionally well.Especially Ted Kennedy and Teresa Heinz Kerry.Ted is such a wonderful public speaker and it shows in his speeches that he is proud to be a democrat (who wouldn't be?).I had never really paid much attention to Mrs. Kerry but tonight I was very impressed.Unlike her predecessors (Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Clinton) she is very good at speech delivery. Laura and Hillary both seem uncomfortable and sometimes it becomes unbearable to watch their monotone deliver.Teresa was quite graceful, eloquent, and she had the entire audience hanging on every word.  So, I said that I would finish my thoughts on 9/11 and the war tonight, but I don't really feel like it.I want to sit here eating my pringles, drinking my iced green tea, and write about whatever pops into my head.First thought...I absolutely love bookstores.I would love to waste away an afternoon walking around looking at books.There is just something so soothing about being surrounded my these stacks of paper and ink. It's quiet and comforting. I bought a book tonight, well two actually.The first is  Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris.I saw him on David Letterman a few weeks ago promoting his latest book and he seemed pretty funny.I absolutely love his sister, Amy, who is one of the fewpeople in the worldthat can make want topee my pants because she is so funny. But I digress, from what...I'm not sure.  Next thought...I just tried to drink my pringles. I have the cup sitting on my right, and the pringles can on my left. Got a little confused...  Thought...I wonder if anybody reads my blog. I know that one person has...he left a comment on a post I deleted so there is no hard evidence of it anymore, but it happened, I promise.  On a related note...why does my blog never show up on the recently updated blog list? Has anybody ever seen their own blog on that list? I really hate it when I click on one and it turns out to be some naked woman staring at me. Ughh. I also hate those blogs where the author feels the need to confuse the hell out of me by not using English. Ok, it is English but it is all abbreviated and misspelled.  Because  becomes  coz,   you  becomes  u,   with  becomes  wit,   the  becomes  da,  and  anyways  becomes  newaiz . I will honestly sit there for far too long trying to crack the code that is their blog.When did this become cool?I think I'm out of touch which is sad because I am a teenager...we are supposed to be the ones in touch. Do people still say cool?
