I am so happy, Senko sounds nice, like a warrior or fighter... Oh, today, the Love Hina show is so touching. It is like the male character found a doll that can move herself and talk. And conincidentally, the doll belonged to the male character's great grandfather. So, naturally, the doll is attached to the male character. And in the end the doll stopped working, so sad, I mean it is like you seem to know her for a long time, caring and loving her, and she just stopped and everything has ended. Maybe, maybe, the doll will be back when the male character's son or grandson visit her again....
