Like on a 'me' day, you need them sometimes. Mmm I smell nice :P Or maybe it's the polish that's on all those cloths beside me... hmm. Stalked by polish again? *sigh* Oh Laura you should find out when people go on holiday or someone should generally know... it would make arranging things a whole lot easier! But on the day of our exam results we definatly should all go out and do something, you know the usual, trash someones house, go into Bristol etc.
