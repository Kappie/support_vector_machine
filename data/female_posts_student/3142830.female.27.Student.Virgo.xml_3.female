But I would just like to say that as an adult fan I can say that the Backstreet Boys have touche my life in ways that they may never know about. This site is a tribute to my BSB devotion.  No I'm not obsessed with them.  Just devoted and love them.  :)  I will use this spot to keep up to date about current BSB events so stay tuned.  :)
