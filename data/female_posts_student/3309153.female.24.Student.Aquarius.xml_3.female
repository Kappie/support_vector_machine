Also, if anyone wants to help tote or pack boxes. ha ha. But I DID think it would be nice to have a get together for the writing group and all our significant others and stuff so that everyone would have at least a passing idea of who we were all talking about during this six month experiment. Plus, I don't get out nearly enough with people my own age, so I'd like to have an excuse for a get together. if anyone else is interested, let me know and we'll plan something. I like to plan.
