I was reading this romance novel  Face the Fire  for purely entertainment because I've simply been too tired to read something that would make me think, but guess what it did.  Well, actually one quote did.  "Some people expect things to fall into their lap. Oh, they might work a bit for it.  I'll just shake this tree, and if I shake it long enough that pretty red apple will plop right into my hand.  Never occurs to them that they might have to climb the damn tree, fall out a couple of times, get some scrapes and bruises before they get to that apple.  Because if the apple's worth wanting, it's worth risking a broken neck."  I realize sitting here that I've never climbed a tree, never been able to risk harm.  I've always been sedate and cautious, hiding behind such things as books and fabricated images.  When I say I've never climbed a tree I mean that literally as well as symbolically.  I have begun to many times but have always stopped as soon as I realize that my feet can no longer touch the ground.  I have always maintained control, maintained my buffer and because of that have never tasted the sweet fruit of beating the odds.  Have I ever wanted something enough to say that I was willing to risk a broken neck?  Yes.  Have I ever gone out on a limb, truly with no backup plan, no harness to catch me if things don't work out exactly as planned?  No.  I am a chronic over analyzer, I pick apart everything I do or say and find flaws, supposedly to help myself.  Instead all that happens is that I lose confidence, lose the strength and blinding excitement that could carry me into the high branches of that apple tree.  I continuously stand on the ground colliding over and over again with the trunk, waiting for the apple to fall, but it is not until the apple is old and rotten that I am able to obtain it.  How does one go about learning to climb trees?  Is there a secret out there somewhere, a book that contains the instructions? Or is it one of those touchy feely, 'every person's journey is different' type of experiences?    My goals for the summer and the future in general: climb a tree, risk it all keep in touch with my current world find some answers learn to enjoy every moment as much as I can  I know they seem cliche and somewhat kitschy but at the moment that is how my mind is operating and playing the game.
