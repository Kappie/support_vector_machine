This horrible act has been going on for too long! These horses consist of pregnant mares, young foals, healthy geldings, old work horses, retired race track horses and more. The worst part is that the USDA promotes horsemeat! (U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service) Most of the horsemeat is sold countries where it is more common to eat horses. In 1994 109,353 pounds of horsemeat was shipped overseas. You can only imagine the increase over the years! Is it okay for perfectly healthy horses, even pregant mares to be butchered?? I THINK NOT!!!!   my thoughts on this article:  as a horse lover, this hurts my heart, but lets think, if you have an old horse that has a bad knee ( take my neighbors for example) and it's in pain even when it walks, it should'nt have to suffer, and it should be sent to the slaughter house, it will die and will never suffer again, and it will be sort of recycling. BUT if the horse is healthy it should'nt be slaughtered. it should be allowed to live happily. if its preganant i mean your killing two horses. its not fair, thats my opinion.
