He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you shouldâ€™ve seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did."              ---Excerpt from J.D. Salinger's  Cather In the Rye .  Confession: I am a secret slob in just about every aspect of my life, except I'm not very good at keeping it secret.  Still ... I am living in the right town for it. Los Angeles: home of deceptions, falsities and all thing fraudulent.    Okay. So now that I've dispensed with the preliminary "why" of my blog title, which I first tried to name  urlLink slander ,  urlLink slanderland ,  urlLink backbitter , or  urlLink bitterness , I can move on to the important stuff, such as disclaimers:  1) This blog, like the vast majority of its kindred, will be essentially personal and thus almost invariably boring.  Of course, I wish it weren't so.  I wish my life were interesting enough to have an audience (and perhaps a standard rock trio to follow me around and play theme music).  2) This blog is full of shit.  Not actually factually untrue shit.  Just slightly exaggerated shit, magnified or contracted images of myself and my enemies. Ha! there's one now! I don't even really have enemies.  Just people I don't care for. I can't even say that I truly hate them, though I throw the word around quite a bit.    3) Though I know no one is really going to bother reading this, I secretly wish that there were devoted fans.  I suppose I could send my blog address to my mother, who would then pass it on to my aunts and dying grandmother, all of who would actually read this shit.  But then, of course, I couldn't write posts like today's (which I will be getting to shortly).  My cousin actually did this, gave out his blog address to the fam.  His mother put him in therapy because of an off-hand comment he made on-line.  Ha-ha.  Well I'm too old for that, my therapy is complete voluntary.  Nope, I'm in danger of being cut-off. Or at least nagged to death about my smoking, drinking, fucking, slacking, and other behavior, which, on the whole, is entirely unscandalous (at least by today's standard, though not by my parent's).    4) I have no good/worthwhile/informative/helpful/interesting opinions on i) the state of world politics, ii) the state of technology, iii) outrages to the online community, iv) anti-spamming measures or iv) anything of general or special interest.  In the words of Dostoevsky (who captured the spirit of blogging in  urlLink Notes From the Underground ):  "But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure? Answer: Of himself. Well, so I will talk about myself."
