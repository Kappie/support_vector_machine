She came over on friday and I went over on saturday.   Friday- Kevan came over at 7:00.  We played donkey kong country 2 (We're almost done the game) and then we worked on the story.  After a little while, we decided to try to contact Robin at the yc.  We finally did after 30 minutes of phoning people to get the #.   When we finished our brief chat with Robin, we wrote more in the story and immitated triple yo-ers on msn.  Kevan and I played playmobil, ate a snack, played donkey kong once more and went to bed at 10:30.    Saturday- We woke up at 8:30 (so early..), ate breakfast and then  we left my house at 12:00 and walked over to Kevan's place.  I pointed out that we should do our ritual and go to mings to get gummies and chips.  After snacking on gummies, we heard  Kevans dad's Harley Davidson wheel into the driveway.  We immediately went down to greet him and his new bike.  Kevans dad then went out riding so we went into the house and snacked on our munchies while playing donkey kong.  After a while, we got tired of trying to beat the boss so we put on yo yo yo-er clothing and headed for the trampoline.  We must of played on the trampoline for quite some time because Kevans mom came home just as we were comming in.  We stayed inside for a little while and then headed back outside to play on the trampoline.   After the trampoline, we had dinner, watched this movie on tv called "Susie Q" and decided to take a nap at 10:30pm and wake up at 11 to watch something on tv.   (We set kevan's alarm clock but we were in a deep sleep and we didn't hear it ring so we didn't watch it).      Sunday- We woke up at 8:30 (again!!),ate breakfast and played donkey kong.  Kevan's dad left to go riding again so we were home alone.  We cleaned up the downstairs and ate lunch.  After lunch, we went on the computer and then kevan watched tv while cleaning up the kitchen.  Meanwhile, I was cleaning Kevans room and organizing my things.  Kevan came into her room after cleaning the kitchen.  We sat on the bed bored.  I suggested that we read over the story until my mom comes to pick me up.  After that, we printed the story out and my mom came to take me home.        Once I got home, I took a shower, cleaned my room, made my birthday wish list (MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 30 DAYS!! WOOHOO!), ate dinner, watched half an hour of the oscars and now I'm writting in the blog to give you guys something to read.    I can't wait t'ill my birthday and t'ill my birthday party which I haven't quite planned out yet.  You're invited pals so feel free to tell me what you would like to do (see a movie, go swimming, go bowling ect.).  Anywho, I'd better get going now.  Enjoy the school week and write in your blogs!  I'm going to go sweep the floor, possibly eat yogurt and do 10 minutes of homework (It's the only homework I got!).  See ya later chums!!
