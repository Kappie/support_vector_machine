The folks from The Grove called to cheerfully inform me that I no longer have a job/internship for the Fall, which means not only do I have no way to pay bills and eat come August, but also that I don't have an internship site. I would have time to correct this problem except, oh wait, that's right I'm leaving the COUNTRY in three days! UGH!  Thanks to Shawn for listening to my bitching and moaning this afternoon. Thanks to Bruce in advance for listening to it tonight.   I'm about one more social work irritant away from dropping the goddamn program at this point.  Cheers!  ~D~
