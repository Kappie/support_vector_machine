Three day weekend...woot....i've been watching alot of movies. i've been really lethargic. I was just on the phone w. jennifer and she said i sounded sad, and not my usual self. well what is that. my usual self. i'm still me, so shouldn't that be me anyway. no matter what i'm acting like. everyone gets into moods. quiet. concentrating.hyper. whatever  "It's good when you can still have fun without alcohol." that was either a reply trying to be nice to someone you dont know, or the way that people must see it? which isn't at all why i said i dont drink. even when offered. the reason being that i say enough stupid stuff when i'm sober, that im not too anxious to go drink and slur my thoughts even more. Not too say that when i'm older and  dont  have ppl breathing down my back, telling me i "dont know what i'm doing", that i wont grab a bacardi, coke and rum, and get completely shit faced once and a while to forget who i am. i just dont need it to be social. b.c it doesn't have the socialing effect of me. opposite. it makes me anti-social. which i learned this summer at the beach house. Too many adults waiting for my brother to turn 21, so  they  could break loose. how ironic.  My father highly amuses me sometimes. He actually sounded surprised:  -"Has there ever been anyone who hasn't asked you out because of me?" -"...Yes.."  One thing that i've always done, is have conversations when i'm alone, with someone i know, so well, that i already know what they are going to say. or how they would respond. So i make up instances, or ask questions of a logical senario that might happen in an everyday situation, and get an answer out of them. But what i've come to wonder, is the answer i get, from myself, or them?
