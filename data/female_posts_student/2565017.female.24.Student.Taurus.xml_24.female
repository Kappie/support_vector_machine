I was tired all the time anyway, and didn't really pay attention.  After school and finishing this groupwork with a couple of classmates, I slept for a while. And had bad dreams. Not nightmares, exactly... just dreams I would rather not have seen. Of a friend of mine.  Anyway, to the main topic. I downloaded something from online, and installed it, and after it my windows started restarting, over and over again. My first thought was that it's the feared and dreaded  sasser . I took off my LAN wire to see if it would stop once I'm not online. It didn't stop.  After that,all I did was open windows in error tolerant status, remove the latest installation and do a complete virus scan, and voilÃ¡, problem gone.I'll be a wee bit more careful about my downloads the next time. The ironic thing is, that my download was supposed to be a reliable firewall...  lol!   Another thing that has crossed my mind is tobuild a homepage again... retro style, using nothing but original html coding. I've done it before, I can do it again =) Oh gosh *giggls*... thinking of the first website I built. Sheesh. It was filled with little animations, couldn't have looked more tacky than it did! What the heck, I was a newbie back then :P My last site looked pretty good, very  urlLink Marimekko  at its simpliest.  Talking about Marimekko... if you want to see a stunning evening gown, go this path: In English -> Product Lines -> Clothing -> Jukka Rintala -> Collection. There's only one gown there, pretty kimono influenced, but I just now became to adore that dress :D Ok, ok, not everyone has to like it just because I do... it is pretty covering. For winterwear, I'd say.  Ok, now I have to stop about fashion and clothes...cos if I don't now, I never will. It's about my bedtime anyway, but since I slept earlier.... oh, dang! I missed CSI, ooooooh nooooooo.... ok, ok, not the end of the world. Well, as I wassaying, since I slept earlier, I'm not going to go to sleep in a while more. I'm not sure what I want to do tho. Maybe surf, maybe watch TV, maybe eat, maybe....
