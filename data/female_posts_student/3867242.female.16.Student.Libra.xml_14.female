I thought I was going to die of the heat. The good thing was everyone who bought something..bought something cold!! I only had to use the fryer like a few times. (Excuse me Drew, but I had to cook a seasoned chicken sandwich for you..haha..it's alright.) When I got home I watched "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"..then I watched a little bit of Harry Potter (haha..Ian), then I talked to some people on ICQ, AOL, and MSN (unfornuately one person who I can't stand was trying to talk to me..), now I'm writing for no reason..haha. Tommorrow, I'm taking driving lessons, and cleaning my room (yeah..wish me luck) and then I'm watching I love the 90s. Then Tuesday...I'm going to finally see Spider Man 2!! Yeah!!!!!!! I'm so happy..I'm such a loser because I get exicited for movies..haha. Well..that all the brainstormig juice that I have. Night...!
