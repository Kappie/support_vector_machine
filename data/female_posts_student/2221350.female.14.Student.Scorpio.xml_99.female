You've been married, divorced, I've been in New York City, taking advantage of the nervous economy. You are flying to Paris to sign a book deal, I am going there on holiday. We'll find nice people who will let us switch seats so we can sit together. We'll talk about the world and make obscure references to political mishaps, and you will make puns. Even though you still can't remember who I am, we'll have a nice conversation and I'll help you get your luggage since you don't speak any French.  at the moment, my the center of my ponderings has been around a certain group of gentlemen which I seem to have fallen in lo0o0ove with. It was just the other day when I realized I had a crush on just about everyone, and felt the need to break it into nice chunks. I love Jonathan, he's funny and musical and oozes charisma, I love a certain someone else, who's intelligent and thoughtful and has red hair. Well just yesterday I met someone else. This guy's name is Jonathan AND he has red hair AND he seems to posses all the qualities I look for in a person AND I talked to him for six hours until 4 this morning. So is this mixture of my two other loves the perfect one for me?   I have no fucking idea!  this week((from Tuesday afternoon and on)) has been fairly uneventful, which is why I won't bother to mention it.  I am becoming increasingly excited about going to live with my dad this summer. I would be making money, and most importantly I would be away from these crazy people in Shreveport. Just this afternoon Devon was bitching at me and when she finally stopped, I simply replied with "I'm going to daddy's". Neither mom nor Devon knew quite what to say. But that doesn't matter, what matters is that Devon is a bastard, mom is insane, and I will miss mammaw and my cat, but can work through that right quick.  this weekend I have a metric ton of homework to do. I have to write 20 pages of notes, write a six page paper, write a book report, and write a film report. Have I started on any of these? Nope! I got the cliffnotes for the book and watched the movie, but everything else I will have to do tonight and tomorrow.   I won't be going to school tomorrow because I have an eye appointment. I got afternoon migraines all last week, so hopefully my prescription has changed and it's not something worse.  I'm gonna take a sec to scream at the top of my lungs that NOBODY HAS BEEN BLOGGING LATELY AND IT'S TOTALLY PISSING ME OFF. That's all I have to say about that.  I think from now on I'll be one of those people who blogs paragraphs of little tidbits like all the time instead of big long weekly things.
