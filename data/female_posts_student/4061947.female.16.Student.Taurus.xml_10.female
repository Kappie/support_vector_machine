At approximately 1:00, the sun came out!!! Then we went on the lazy river, followed by the wave pool.  We did that for the entire day.  I ate dippin dots and a deep fried snickers! And a corn dog.  It was amazing.  These two creepy kids were talking to us. One was going to be a freshman and the other was going to be a junior. It wasn't neat.  Creepy boys are drawn to Ashlee.  Um, so yeah that's how my day was.
