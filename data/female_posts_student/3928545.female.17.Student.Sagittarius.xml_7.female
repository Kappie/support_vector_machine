I was screaming and I leaned out w/ my leg to shoot and he got me right in the thigh. I got hit in the face, the lenses of my mask, the hopper, and my finger. The only welt I have though is from the one on my thigh, it looks gross! After the first two games I got over screaming. All the guys I played with were really nice. They didn't let me win or anything, they were cool. I never hit anyone either but it was still fun. I stole this really neat paintball jersey from my brother, it doesn't fit him anymore, and it's really cool. Now my dad is screaming his head off because my brother is spoiled, go figure, it wasn't like my dad raised him or anything. Yeah, right. Whatever.
