Especially when you try writing about foods and fats when you have a stomach ache... eeew...peanut oil is high in fat....hmm....no worries about that...I think i'm going to lie on the floor and think of how sad my life is.  eat sleep study work laugh, eat sleep study work laugh, eat sleep study work laugh....... My life isnt exciting.  Sometimes i wish lived in Naruto's world where there is such thing as Chakra and Adventure.  These days, people are afraid of everything.  They afraid of animals, sickness, other people, unknown and themselves.  i like the unknown.  it has a mysterious yet exciting ring to it.  The unknown..... Adventure, mystery, excitement...the way of the ninja *sigh*
