Today I woke up with Jerm and drove out to Davis to do some packing. I got all of my books and notebooks packed, and most of my bathroom crap, and now they are sitting in the car waiting for me to unload them. But the neighbor's son is sitting out front in his car and sometimes I'm too shy. Seriously he's just sitting in his car. Earlier he was blasting loud music, but now he's just sitting and making me feel bad about not doing my work or straightening out my car for Jerm who will be grumpy if there isn't a good place to park. Oh well.  Thanks to Lisa for the grad pics, I totally copied a bunch of them onto my computer. I'm glad to see that your camera works well. All I need now is my own digital camera, and this whiny blog might turn into a picture blog and you all won't have to read about my sad life any more. Speaking of my sad life, let me tell you more of it: this week I hung around with Roz and Holly, but mostly Holly. That was the main reason for no posts, because I actually had a human being to entertain and talk to, rather than all of you imaginary cyberspace folks. Not that I don't like you, but sometimes you can be a little distant, you know? But what can you do? Okay, I should probably just unload my car despite the  large man sitting in his car in front of my house. Or maybe I can get Jerm to help me with the lifting later on. Books are f**king heavy.
