THE public will remember how much their feelings were assailed a few weeks since, by numerous accounts in the democratic papers:- First, that Gen. Winchester, and a number of his attendants, were most horribly  murdered, tomahawked, scalped  and  mangled ; and secondly, when it was found, that the General was alive and well, that then the horrid murder, tomahawking, scalping, burning alive in houses and other enormities, were transferred on Major Madison, and other officers of the General's army engaged in the battle of  Frenchtown:  (...)  And I wonder who the Hon. D.A. White was, whose name is in such pretty writing at the top. And whose hands held this paper before me, whose eyes read it and what their story was. And who printed these letters, issue 3,025, and who sat round coffee tables sipping tea discussing these issues, the news about Gen. Winchester and Major Madison and the tomahawking and such, which was or was not true and which was of course all linked to the British because they were at war and therefor evil (seems like not much has changed). And the small burnt hole in the middle, how did it get there, and what old words did that fire eat? (Tiny brown piece fluttering down on my carpet, it's an n, and it's forever lost) And the phone's ringing, and I'm picking up and it's now again, and here, and very much 2004. Which is fine with me, really.
