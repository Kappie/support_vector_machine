The guys that work at Krystals kept hitting on us, asking us if they could be 'a part of our clique.' And after that a bunch of funny stuff happened, and I swear I have never laughed that much in my life. Haha, I just read Sara's profile. I can't believe you figured out that we only like you because your parent free house is THE SPOT (cough-formeandyoutobringboysoverandfulfilloursexualfantasiesat-cough). Whhoooo, excuse me. Anyways..I'm watching Zoolander, which is probably why I'm talking about Sara, since its the movie about our life. "What, were you coming to tell me what a bad EUGOOGALIZER i was?" story of my life for real, making up and misusing words, because  I can . Oh, Sai, remind me to tell you about the super funny porn I passed over last night when I was going to sleep. The name of one of the characters was Dickus Minimus..real sexy, right?
