Cut butter into dry ingredients.  Add cherries and walnuts and toss to mix.  In a separate bowl, beat together cream and egg, and slowly pour into dry ingredients.  Knead just until it comes together, 3-4 times.  Divide dough in half.  On lightly floured board, shape each half into 6" round.  Cut into wedges (4-6).  Bake on ungreased cookie sheet about 20 minutes.  Serve warm.  I'm thinking these might be good with oatmeal - I'm going to have to experiment.
