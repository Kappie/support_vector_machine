God does answer my prayers.. he does create miracles, juz like the time when the senior contingent looked to pathetic and still got a gold medal + the most prestigious prize; the challenger shield.. wasnt God watching over us and blessing us? so what if i can see ghosts.. so what if i saw one at home? thst doesnt mean that there's Buddha.. i think if these goes on, i'll be back to a free-twinkle life again.. okae, maybe not..
