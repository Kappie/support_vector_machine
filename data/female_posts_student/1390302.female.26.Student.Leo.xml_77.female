Just when you believe that the one person for you is as sweet as they’re every going to get, they emerge with something completely and totally loving.  In my case, that day was today.    I stayed up all night cleaning up the apartment because, let’s face it, it was a complete and total mess.  No, the word mess just doesn’t cover it; it was a complete wreck.  Not just messy but almost dirty and I CANNOT live like that –though I have been for the past month or two.  So I went on a cleaning frenzy and poor Matt retreated to the bedroom to escape my fitful frenzy.  I cleaned everything, including the ceiling fan, using the vacuum cleaner’s attachments to clean the edges of the carpet –behind the TV, under the tables, etc.  Anyway, you get the picture.  So I was cleaning all night until about 7am.  Yep, it was a mess to crown all messes!  Finally I was done about the time the sun was rising…  I got Matt up for his Physics class and went to bed.  He came home then told me he was going to go out and get this game, Fight Night 2004 that he has been wanting desperately.  I nodded groggily and told him to get me Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles while he was out, then rolled over and went back to sleep.  He left and when he returned and woke me he returned with my favorite snack, a cookie sandwich from the Cookie Factory, my game, and a present!  Anyone who knows me knows I love to get presents; they just make my day.  I also love to buy presents… all and all I am just a present loving person!  Anyhow, he handed me a box and when I opened it and pulled out all the stuffing there was a small silver keepsake box inside, it was even inscribed!  The inscription reads “Just because it’s Thursday.”  Inside the box was a small silver necklace with a “K” charm!  I love things that are personalized!  Even my purse is personalized, I bought a black handbag with a cream colored “K” on the front.  I believe my desire to have things that are personalized stems from some small well of vanity that springs within me, and the fact that my name has an odd spelling so it has always been hard to find anything personalized.  You just don’t find things on the rack that say “Kristyn”.  It’s okay, it makes me feel special so, THANKS MOM!  Anyway, I have now resorted to just having things that say “K”.  I almost cried when he gave it to me!  He bought me a gift that is something I really, really wanted, just because!  Matt is the best guy in the world and he proved that today without the shadow of a doubt!  “Just because it’s Thursday”.  ~Princess Kristyn
