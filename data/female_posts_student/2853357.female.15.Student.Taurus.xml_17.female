WTF! its the last 'class' before summer and then we start ALL OVER AGAIN in 10th grade... and i've missed NOTHING compared to other people.   i'm refraining to say anything bad about anyone online...   but my anger level is high... very high.   (i must remain calm... i must remain calm... i must somehow express my anger before I explode...........)
