Of course, with my receiving 'em, that is quite likely to change. *cackles*   I'm in a better mood now, in case you can't tell.   Where is everyone????? I haven't spoken to anyone. In fact, I have spoken ONLY to A, A and B this whole summer. And maybe S a little bit. This is making me rather scared. I do have other friends... don't I??? *shifty eyes*   Do you know, I almost typed shitty eyes there.   For some reason this strikes me as hilariously funny.
