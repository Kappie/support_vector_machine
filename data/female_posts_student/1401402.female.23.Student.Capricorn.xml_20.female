Results came out and I have to take Elementary Algebra, English Grammer and Writting. My results made me very unhappy for some reasons. Now I'm stressed out about school, how many unit should I take? What about work? Will I be able to manage making money enough for my bills? Gosh, what happens if I dont past my classes? What about financial aid? Will or am I qualify for it? I've got thousands of question running through my mind. Its hard just to think about it already. I'm gonna be okay rite?   I've got some interesting quotes that i want to shared. Here are some of my favorite.  "Make the most of yourself for that is all there is of you" - Ralph Waldo Emerson  "If you really wat something you can figure out how to make it happen" - Cher  "Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt" - Special Olympics Motto  "You never really lose until you quit trying" - Mike Ditka  "If life gives you a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it" - Anonymous  "I've finally stopped running away from myself. Who else is there better to be?" - Goldie Hawn  "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind"  - Dr. Seuss  Another Night Last Saturday night, I was at Club NV. I couldnt drink, couldnt down my remy for some reason. I had half a cup of Pink Pussy, Long Island, and Sex on The Beach. Everything was NASTY to me that night. I didnt have too much fun because no one wants to dance with me. Referring to my friends, their so boring made me sad. And the ones who want to dance are just strangers. Those are the people I've always turn down for some reasons. I guess I'm too used to that by now. Dont like strangers and I never will. All I thought about was that IBM guy. His blowing my mind off. Every single song that I've danced with him once before hunt me down and made me sorrow. I thought about him couldnt take it anymore so I left the club after an hour and a half of partying.   In and Out Again Last night you came back to me. Asked me out to dinner. I said yes. The question is What the Hell happen to you? We spent a very good quality of time talking about our lost times which was nice. But I've learn to let go but your back which makes it harder for me to let you go again. Just hope that this time wont be like the last. Friends blame me for being too nice, but hey this is who I am. I dont care as long as I'm having fun and I'm happy. My happiness is just PRICELESS.
