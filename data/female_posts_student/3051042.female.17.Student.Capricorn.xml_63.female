Brother and Co. were gone to Canada by then.  *door bell, looks out the window*  LMAO. Some door-to-door solicitor holding a box that says FRESH on the front. Vanna White wannabe.  Anyway. I went downstairs to wake Josh up, and we went out for Starbucks. Talked about last night and why I wasn't invited to Canada. I told him I no longer care. I figure it's the whole "little sis tagging along" situation. Went back to my house to chill, we were going to watch Kill Bill before he had to go to work, but Michelle called. She came over and we hung out for awhile. Went back to Starbucks. She asked why I wasn't in Canada. Discussed that situation, yet again. I must of said or done something wrong. And damn... does it hurt to be left out, or even worse, having your friend invited but not you. Josh turned them down because of work and what not. Well, I don't know what Henk and Nick's intentions were, but if it was to hurt me they've succeeded. :-/  Michelle and I talked about her and Ned as well. I haven't really taken thing to heart, well at least not until this morning. I put myself in her shoes and Ned did a lot of things to break her heart. Looking at it now, I don't know how she deals with it, because if that shit were to happen to me I'd be a complete mess. We went to Pinball Pete's for some DDR stress relief, I lost at pool but I felt really good after playing. I don't know why, I mean I fucking lost, but I'm in such a better mood.   I really appreciate Josh and Michelle for being the upper to my down time. I don't really know how I'd survive without some people... much love.  >>--
