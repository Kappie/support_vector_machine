My room is not quite finished, but soon will be, and the kitchen is done, I managed to uncover my piano books for my lesson tomorrow (although I haven't practiced at all... is there such thing as "cramming" for a piano lesson?), and my mother forbids us from going down the hill to vacuum the old house, as they are doing construction on the road, and she doesn't want us to... get hit over the head with a power drill? You know, safety precautions like that. Anyhow, I manage to fill up my drawers and part of the closet shelves. Yay!
