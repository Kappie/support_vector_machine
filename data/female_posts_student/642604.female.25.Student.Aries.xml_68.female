I think I finally have it but yesterday, Friday, was scary because I took the very first turn I have to make after leaving my house too fast and I spun out. I came within 4 feet of hitting another car, which doesn't seem like that big a deal, but it is when you're spinning and spinning and you just see this parked car coming closer and closer and all you can think is PLEASE don't let me get in another accident, especially in someone else's car. But after that I was good to go. AND the day before that I got run off the road by some bitch in a van! So tonight, after tenative plans fell through because of Toni getting sick, I had to go to 7-11 to pick up cigarettes and I decided it would be a really good idea to just keep driving... so I drove for like 90 minutes or so... and I have successfully improved on first gear. As much as I would love to say that I mastered it, I have not. I still squeal or stall sometimes but not nearly as much as I have in the past. I am quite proud of this achievement, even if you are not! So what else has happened lately??? Um, I just scored a ticket to Mam Mia in NYC when I go on my trip in March. I am very excited, now all I want to do is go see Mama Mia and I will be very happy. We'll see how well that goes. Oh but now Friday is on and I have lost my concetration on whatever I was writing anyway. [ Sat Feb 01, 10:26:03 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] RESPECT MY AUTHOR-I-TIE!
