That friday night i went malaysia wif my family, stayed at one of my parents fren's hse. e next day we set off to taman negara a nature park in Johor. we reach our destination in e noon. we had a guide along wif us. We took a boat abt 45mins into e forest, rested there for a day, went for a swim in the lake. The water extremely cold *gaa gaa* like u added ice cubes into yr bath tub when u bathe. e next morning, we set off for an hour trekking to waterfall n swimming lagoon(bluff ppl one juz some lakes). e waterfall was on the average quite nice. We passed many bridges(diao qiao). They were so shaky, seems like they will break any time. thanx god nth happens! hehex...i climbed up a tree(so slippery nearly fell before i could get to e top) abt 2 storey high n jump into the lake...i m e only gal who did that! haha...Scary(as if heart popping out) but exciting! woO~ if i can i would wanna try again! After that we sat on rubber boat, 4 person to a boat n canoe down e lake back to our starting place. so tiring but again fun! e 1st night didn't haf a gd slp cos the floor was too hard. Second night slept in chalet but bed was too soft! -_-'" reach home on mon evening.    e next day in sch was so refreshing after 3days of holiday. BUT during training, 1600m "palor" my stomach started to ache again...argh same old pain like fri. i cant carry on running the pain is slowing me down. den ytd campus "palor" my stomach pain again. injury? or mental? training hard 4 pass 1 month juz for ivp picking up pretty well but now down wif pain. *sad*  hope it's juz some irritating pain n will go off soon. my leg muscle is so sour till i cant even lift my legs up for long run...juz hope tt everything goes fine. i going to c doc tml morning.
