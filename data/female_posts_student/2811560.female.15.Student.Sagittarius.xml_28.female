So Emily and I went to the Mr. Lancer competition last night, which was sort of a beauty pagent for guys. It was hilarious. And Andy played and sang the North Dakota song...and OMG....ahh. He was awesome. We melted. Well anyways, he won, and that was pretty cool. Yes, well I've been writing a lot of music lately..and its turning out really well. Especially the one I wrote today called Bright Eyes, its really, really good. I don't know how I did it. But yeah, I'm thinking thats what I'll play for the talent show next year. We're going car shopping tomorrow, yay. No, the car is not for me. But its fun to shop anyways. Ugh, I have a ton of work to do this week...wind ensemble music, lines memorized, the whole bit. It'll be fun! Not...
