She is still fun to be with. Other then that it was another boring day. I hate it is the 2 week of vacation we have not done anything. The only good thing that I think we are going to do this summer is go to six flags. I cant wait. It is going to be so fun. My sister and I are going to go on all the roller coasters. Well I don't know if I will I think the thing I am most scared of are roller coasters but my sister said that if I don't she is going to drag me on them. I cant wait for next year so I can see (him) next year. I think he is mad at me though for not going out with him last year but whatever. Couldn't anyways. That's all I have to say.     p.s. lets take the retard out ( its a inside joke and obviously your not inside of it)!!!!!
