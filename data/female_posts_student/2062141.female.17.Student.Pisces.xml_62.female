Meh well I guess I'm just waiting for tomorrow (Charlotte's b-day party) to go anywhere.        And I swear I won't talk about Jason Mraz anymore...as much.... Cause yeah that was a little insane. I just had to share with you the best night ever. I'm very thorough. Haha understatement. Hey I'm not asking you to read this... but do... cause i'm awesome....
