Haven't talked 2 Heather yet. I should call l8tr. MK called this morning but no time 2 talk. g2call her when i get offline. that means in an hour! *lol* Talked 2 Jared friday. It was interesting... especially about the  "switch"  thing. honestly idk y he would ask that but it came up so...  no , jared, I don't think I would. I still think it was odd that u asked though. oh well, g2g check otha blogz. Byeness!
