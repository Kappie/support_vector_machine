Maya woke me up at 2 cuz Grind was comming on at 2:15 or soemthing and I wanted to watch it again. While we watched grind I braided Maya's hair in little braids.. yesterday I parted it all and put littel elastics in so it would be easier to braid it hte next day. It only took about 30 mins to braid it but still the little bitch complained. Mom "cooked" a turkey for supper it was gross. I dont know how she does it but mom always manages to fuck up. The turkey basically was in two pieces by the time it was done cookin.. yeah my moms a bad cook. I fell asleep and didint wake p until 8 so i had way more than enough sleep so now i am right wired.  Last night i got in a lil fight with this guy.... and he called me a stupid head among other things,, but hey he is in level 3.. hes not smart. stupid head must have been the best thing he could have thought of. L  Last night as well a few of these people whom i do not know kidnapped me and forced me to do things that involved darkness and a lot of pulling.... lol. Mom questioned hwat i brought home and maya thinks my souvieners are pretty cool. she wanted to put them on her bike but nooo.
