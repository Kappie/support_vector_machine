The peter pan movie was amazing! the musical score which was composed by  James Newton Howard  was just awesome! the music was  magical . i really like this movie and so its on my list of movies to buy, but since my birthday is coming up its on my birthday list so maybe i wont have to buy it after all who knows. anyways back to movies we then rented win a date w/ tad hamilton. that movie was good. i dont know if i want to buy it or what but i'd like to see it again...there were some hilarious parts to it. i suggest you see both movies for those of you who do read my blog...if there are any people.  on to other news...i guess i'll be working at McDonald's this summer...im kind of excited but yet im not. one good thing about this job is that the manager is my aunt but yes she'll treat my like the rest but im family...anywho i best be going.
