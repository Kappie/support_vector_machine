Right now, my fellow literary-magazine people are using PageMaker to create layouts. I'm thoroughly confused and quite lost, since I've never used the program before. I've had fun tinkering with it, though. It's just getting a little boring. Sooo I felt like writing on here.  And..I have nothing to ramble on about. I could vent my anger about how  wrong  our literary magazine is, as I've found from the lecture things I've been sitting through..but..I can save that until tomorrow when I get home.  I'm kind of homesick, but really I just wish I could be with some people I know. I don't mind being placed in situations where I'm basically on my own and have to make friends..it's ok, if I'm in a good mood. But I had to deal with new people last week..and this week I'm outnumbered, and out of my area of..expertise, I suppose. Tennis camp is..a lot different than journalism camp, to say the least. At least I can still look forward to going back there in a few weeks and working on my slice with Juan Nunez. Yay!  I started reading  The Joy Luck Club  by Amy Tan this morning. I like it a lot. Chinese stuff interests me. And now that I think about the Chinese culture, I always remember the bracelet I nearly always wear that's on my arm right now. It's a jade bracelet, with jade that's truly from China. It used to be very green, but it's just kind of white now, with a faint, green tinge to it. It's got a really neat way of adjusting, but it would be kind of hard for me to describe it. The string is like..no other string in the US, really. You can only get it from China. My Mom's already tried looking for it..many times. The red string stands for Luck, and the green jade has a kind of interesting..background. Supposedly, it's a way to protect people. Well, rather, if you wear jade, and it breaks..then you "know" that the jade saved you from a situation that might have killed you. It's hard for me to explain. I can be superstitious at times, which absolutely no sense..but..whenever I'm going into a completely new place and environment (ex: Journalism camp), it's just comforting to wear it. It has also helped me through many tests XD   Something to talk about...something..to..type and ramble on about, rather. Ummm. Ok. I give up. It's almost time to go, anyway.  I'll try to put in some big posts when I get home. ^^;
