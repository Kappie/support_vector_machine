Roddick said he wanted to see what Sharapova wore at the gala.   "Will it be short? Is it going to be long? Disappointed I won't get to see that," Roddick said. "I might just sneak in and crash the party. I'll bring the beer, man. Let's go."   After her victory over Serena Williams in the women's final Saturday, the 6-foot Sharapova said one of the most exciting rewards was the champion's ball.   She got that slightly wrong. After the last ball in 1977, formalities were revamped and the function became the champion's dinner.   At the ball, the women's and men's champions danced together as part of the official program. Federer wasn't expecting to re-institute the ritual.   "You should know there's no more dancing," he said.   Olympic ideals Now that he's got three Grand Slam titles, Roger Federer will focus on winning an Olympic gold medal for Switzerland.   "It's been a dream of mine to represent my country, to win a medal there once," Federer said. "I came so close four years ago. I'm really going over there to maybe do one step better."   Federer lost a bronze-medal match to Frenchman Arnaud Di Pasquale at the Sydney Olympics.   Center stage Andy Roddick's coach, Brad Gilbert, was upset that the U.S. Open champion played only one match on Centre Court before his final against Roger Federer.   But Roddick looked right at home at the start of his first Wimbledon final, hitting 18 winners in the first set. Things went downhill from there.   "It was nice to get out there," Roddick said. "It was great. There's no place like it. That's the most prestigious court that I'll ever have a chance to play on, or that anyone will have a chance to play on."   Connors raising the roof Jimmy Connors, who won Wimbledon in 1974 and 1982, dislikes the idea of a roof over Centre Court. Organizers plan to build a retractable roof for the 2009 tournament.   "For me, there's more to winning Wimbledon than just actually playing tennis," Connors said in a newspaper interview. "Dealing with the elements, the rain delays and all the general waiting around is all part and parcel of these championships and winning here."   The 2004 tournament was plagued by rain, with two full days washed out and showers causing interruptions or early finishes on all but three days.   Federer running herd After Roger Federer won Wimbledon last year, Gstaad tournament officials honored him as the first Swiss man to win a Grand Slam event and gave him a cow named Juliette, and she has since had a calf.   Federer is fine with two cows, which is good because officials from the Swiss Open told Reuters on Monday that they will not repeat the gesture this year.    Which won't hurt the Wimbledon champion's feelings. "I'm fine with two for the moment," said Federer.  hmmm i am disappointed in roddick  slightly  ok so odd 13 this is for you:      quote:Fall is my favorite season in Los Angeles, watching the birds change color and fall from the trees.
