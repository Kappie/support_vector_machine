Mr Cheng's traditional costume is totally funny! Hilarious, I must say.  I burst out laughing when I saw him. Haizzz, that was kind of mean of  me... afterall, Mrs Clark said that we should have compassion... so I  won't make such snide comments, but I'll think it in my mind quietly...  Haizzz...I have to sleep now..now Evalyn can use the computer. Not fair..but never mind.
