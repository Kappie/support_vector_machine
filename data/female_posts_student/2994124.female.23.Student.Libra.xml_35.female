It's all going pear shaped means everything is going wrong, going downhill, all of a mess.  Not sure why this means that though.  Yes this is a pretty common english phrase. But beware - Jamie Oliver uses some very unusual phrases too - like Pucker tucker (menaing good food).  A Precinct - is like an undercover (as in has a roof over the walkways, but not necessarily all one building) shopping centre or mall.  A shopping precinct.    I definitely think we should publish an english-canadian dictionary!!  Blog more later love Karenxx  P.S Melanie DOES sound EXTREMLEY funny when she says "I knnnooooooow!" But it's sweet too.  P.P.S It's lovely to have comments! Thanks guys!
