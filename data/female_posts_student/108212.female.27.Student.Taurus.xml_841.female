Speaking of watching, SciFi is premiering their new series called TAKEN.  Its produced by Steven Spielberg a must see for all you buffs out there.  Knowing these cable channels it will be repeating all night so if you missed the beginning wait a few hours and you will see the beginning AGAIN.  I like the Chloe hairstyle Ching!  Didnt notice it was her hairstyle at first.  Did you know that you can view her computer's contents online?  Finally you can virtually view an IMAC online.  My brother says you can even look into her trash folder and view the JPG files she deleted from her desktop.  I wonder if there are any pornography in there?  (wink)   Heres my list:  Lana Lane (from Smallville of course)  Kelly Packard (from Ripley's)  still remember her from California Dreams - Teen NBC   urlLink Kate Botello  (former TECHTV show host)  lastly,  urlLink Morgan Webb  (TSS show specialist)   Gosh Im such a GEEK! ~NET
