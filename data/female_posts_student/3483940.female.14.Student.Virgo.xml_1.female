It is really quite unneccessary to hold hands all the time.  it's not like the other person is suddenly going to RUN AWAY or something.  And no one wants to see you shoving your tongue down someone else's throat.  that's just sick.  can't people keep your hands off of each other for like TEN MINUTES!!  And don't touch each other in inappropriate places while in public.  And don't make out on corners where people can see you.  It is all just wrong.  have some compassion for the people who have to see it.  no one wants to see that.  vicky
