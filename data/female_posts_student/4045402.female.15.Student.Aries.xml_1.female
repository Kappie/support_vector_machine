On the first night of the fair, I woke up really early and went with Mel. We eventually hung out with Rob and Aaron and we went and saw Nick's band play and eventually Flood as well. Then at the end of the night, Mel pushed me n Rob together and now we're dating..      Then throughout the rest of the fair, Mel and I went there every morning except for friday the 13th lol. We had a blast chilling with Beano, playing truth or dare on Chris's phone (which was sooo badly x rated), calling Rob, Aaron, and Beano fatasses right infront of Chris, the tampon conversation.. oh so many good times..   The there were the times with Rob, but there's no need to get into the mushy stuff.. let's just say he was adorable and i'm happy to be with him..      So now that I am with the sweetest guy i've ever met, friends with someone i haven't talked to in a while, got closer with other friends and people i didn't think i liked much, i am in pretty good shape for a change. i pray to God every once in a while, which is a lot more than i used to, so i'm getting better with that, my self esteam isn't as bad anymore, and everything just seems so much better now.      Although everything seems ok, i still have my problems..i think there are just always problems no matter how good things are, but right now, i couldnt care less about problems. It's like there's no reason to care what's coming at me cuz right now i'm loved by 3 very important people, and that's all that matters..Mel, Aaron, and Rob.      Dance and school will be starting up soon, and everything will be as it should be. Lunch will be a blast, and i'm looking forward to school as sad as it is. As much as I'm gonna miss the summer, I miss the fun times at lunch and being surrounded by the same group of friends all the time instead of once in a while when we all happen to have the time in our busy summer schedules. oh well..only a few more weeks..
