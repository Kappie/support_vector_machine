I did the worst on that part), Linkin Park (I could never listen to even "light" rock music, too angry, but I did the best on that part) and Michelle Branch, which was much more to my liking (although it should have been Mr. John Mayer for that part I think.  LOL.  And I definitely haven't done subtraction and definition and those types of math problems by hand since about 6th grade, so that was actually quite challenging.  Mr. Pokemon Jessie's girl (hahaha my mom spelled his name, Jesse as Jessie and he got mad) calls out "Oh this will be no problem for me, I'm in Pre-Calculus."  Well, aren't you just so cool Mr. Know It All.  I think all of us in that class would think it was a little hard because we just do it on la calculatrice anyways. So I hope you lose Mr. I Take Pre-Calulus.  Oh my this night isn't even over and I'm definitely annoyed.  Haven't started those torture plans yet, though...    Anyways, also I am uber happy that I got to burn the new Norah Jones CD from my mom's friend Carlene.  The CD is so mellow, I love it.  Especially with how aggravated we all know I get.  Then I burned her the Josh Kelley CD so I can spread the love.   I saw pictures of a dog that looks like a fox, but she's sort of cute I think.  She's one of those dogs from the Sterling Animal Shelter that get rescued from Puerto Rico like the one that the cute old couple whose house I always go to during YAHOO have.
