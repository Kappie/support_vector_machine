I thought we did really good but i guess not as good as i thought we got a 2 rating. the other band, 9-10 got a 3 rating which is just unbelievable b/c i thought they did better than what they did at the parade of bands. anywho back to my band we played really good i thought but yes there were some mistakes but overall i thought it was good. my solo-sih trio-ish part i sort of goofed up on in this one measure where i always mess up on but i dont think it was that noticable.   Saturday : i had a wedding reception to go to which was a total complete boring time. the food was good but it was super boring. dad and i didnt go to the races which i guess is ok but  tony stewart  was at knoxville i guess, supposedly.  Sunday : i went out to my grandparents house for a lunch type of thing and laura and my little cousins were there. it was grand. i went out to the pasture and hit a baseball around then i lost it and couldnt find so i looked forever til i found it and i did then stopped and decided to mow the pasture. i got a nice sunburn. dad looks like a LOBSTER! ha!
