So, I saw 9/11, only weeks after most of American youth, I have been disturbed in many other ways but this uneasiness is different.  I had been one of those people who read every piece of literature I could find in print post 9/11 to try to find the reason for the heinous attacks, try to find that one US News article that would compress fifteen years or so and describe the events which lead up to these acts.  I have always found that fundamentalists of any faith, although sitting on the far left or right of a see saw always had profound principles; methodical, philosophical, religious, and steadfast grounds for most decisions that are made. In a far reach, I grew to respect these motives, meaning they were fueled by much more than personal gain or wealth.  I will never understand why besides wealth, people only also respond to violence and humiliation, and therefore my respect stopped at just that respect, not admiration or alliance with these actions.  In debates that would follow, and ones that still sprout every so often, I would say why should we wonder why our country would be so infamous, there are countless caves in which our enemies could be born.  America has shown a disregard for principle, hardly held to its word, and scarcely remained loyal.  This movie was an eye - openner in a different respect though...  As a country we have been blindfolded, spun around and sent to find the pinata.  Wealth and opportunity run rampant here, and to my luck it is even available to me, a minority woman.  The beauty in this land lies here along with freedoms that are neatly trimmed around the edges but for the most part freedoms none the less.  There is a price though...the rich will remain rich, by any means necessary, and the poor will always remain poor.  The closing arguments in the movie described the necessity of this hierarchy to achieve the world power status that we hold as a nation.  Most of our causes are futile ones, our arguments, weak ones, and we are blindly lead to believe that our government is in place to aid the people (including underserved populations) vs. maintaining this hierarchy in the country and the superego complex that we feed in order to rule the world through domination.  There has been so much smoky confusion put in place (loophole after loophole), that it's hard to notice the caniving nature of the ruling body and this movie just brought to light the fact that we, the public as a unit, have all been victimized in some way, while others fueled not by principle but by personal gain seem to be winning the race.  The world has suffered by the hand of these manipulations with unnecessary loss of life, destruction of cities, and enforced poverty....  I was just left uneasy, I wanted to try to dupe them back, legitimately, the ideas involved sacrifice giving up any dream of truly becoming a disgustingly wealthy woman with many shoes, so damnit...for now I'll rock the vote...
