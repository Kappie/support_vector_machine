So I recon for a silver wedding anervisery thing u shud get ur folks a silver candle thing their quite cool and they come in all shapes colours and sizes. YAY!! I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sick of doing h/w and c/w all at the same time.  It is doing my little head in.  I really dont get the point of soooo much homework and coursework, do u?  I think that homework should be abolished.  it's mean and smelly and takes all night, quite literally, then I get lumbered with a stupid Graphics teacher, mentioning no names *Coumrsaundersgh* decides that he is going to check our work yesterday for today, fine spend 3 hrs doing it, does he check it NO.  GRRRRRRRRRRRR he is soooo annoying. Rite moan over.  I have smelly hayfever that smells and is annoying.  Kes I feel selfish all the time, but u never hear me complaining, k well mayby u do, but not that much, and they way i see it is people like u and me spend 2 much time thinking about the wellfare of other people and not about ourselves.  Ok well not all the time but sometimes is good. xx
