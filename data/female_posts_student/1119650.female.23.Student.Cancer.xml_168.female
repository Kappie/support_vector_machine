"Motorcycle Drive-By" Summer time and the wind is blowing Outside in lower Chelsea And I don't know What I'm doing in this city The sun is always in my eyes It crashes through the windows And I'm sleeping on the couch When I came to visit you That's when I knew That I could never have you I knew that before you did Still I'm the one who's stupid And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by The cigarette ash it flies in your eyes And you don't mind You smile And say the world it doesn't fit with you I don't believe you You're so serene Careening through the universe Your axis on a tilt You're guiltless and free I hope you take a piece of me with you And there are things I would like to do That you don't believe in I would like to build something But you'll never see it happen And there's this burning Like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive Where's the soul? I wanna know New York City's evil The surface is everything But I could never do that Someone would see through that And this is the last time We'll be friends again And I'll get over you You won't know who I am And there's this burning Just like there's always been I've never been so alone And I've, I've never been so alive So alive I go home to the coast It starts to rain I paddle out on the water Alone Taste the salt And taste the pain I'm not thinking of you again Summer dies and swells rise The sun goes down in my eyes See this golden wave Darkly coming To take me home And I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive
