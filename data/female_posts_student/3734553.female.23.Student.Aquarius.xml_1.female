In the first one, he got married and continued to refer to our talk at LL when ever he saw me.  In the second one, we were all at ACL, K, S, N, E, the girlfriend, and the other two guys.  N and the g were fighting and the new bass guitarist came up to me and told me to give him some space to work it out.  But that it was all for me.  Strange.  It is odd that we can go a year without a real conversation, and then that night he thinks he can come up to me and tell me those things.  I always thought it was there because of the smile, but he has been so involved with someone else that it is just strange.  I was so angry with him for so long and maybe I still am a little frustrated.  How do you react when someone tells you, you were his best kiss ever, that he thinks about you all the time, that your so responsible and he has never had that before?  What do you do when he says this with his fiance in the room, and he hasn't had anything to drink?  I was in shock, the only thing I managed to spit out was "aren't you engaged?"  I guess the reason I've been thinking about it is because so many people I know are getting married.  I would kill any guy that was engaged to a friend and was saying those things to some other girl, especially a girl he doesn't know that well.  I wonder if they will really go though with the wedding.  And I'm mad at myself for being flattered when he told me.  I don't want to be on a pedestal.  Even though that is the only it works between us.
