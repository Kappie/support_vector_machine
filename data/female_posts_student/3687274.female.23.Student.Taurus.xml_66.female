I totally expect a lot of people.  I don't really give a shit what anybody thinks.  I am an asshole.  I was born an asshole.  I will die an asshole.  Fuck you if you don't like it.  There is absolutely nothing I can do to change it.  Trust me, I've tried... and I'm done trying.   I'm learning Japanese.
