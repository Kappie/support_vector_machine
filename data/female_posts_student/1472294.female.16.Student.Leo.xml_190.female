In the mid- morning to afternoon: * Able to watch the film after so many hassle and trouble, crossing road, squeezing in MRT, wearing red and white badges  * Quite meaningful and touching, I was so surprised that I never cry.... * Dismissed after the movie ended and we went to PS to eat * Hate the food, wasted so much money * Went back to Orchard becoz I had feelings for it.... Saw not much of our school people, WHERE HAVE THEY GONE!?!  A little tired that's why cut short my exactly 12 hours journey, but I went back home and had my neo print pictures taken, I looked so fierce lor... Haiz, shy, shy... *^_^*
