And you would think that people - okay, boys - would have gotten over the near-irrisistable urge to steal girls' journals and run off with them. But apparently, I was mistaken. This is far too much to expect from 16 year old boys. I won't name any names but SOMEONE (Austin) decided it would be hilarious to attack me, tickle me, and then run away with my journal to the one place I am not allowed to go, which is, of course, the boys bathroom, which is where he "hid" that one time when he stole my cell phone and started calling people with it. I stood there holding the door open so I could see what was going on while whining at him to give it back, and he opens it up, looks down at it, and says "I love the boys in Hanson" as if he were reading something I wrote. Why was this was the first thing that came into his head? I have no idea, because that is NOT what I wrote. Fortunately, I was able to get it back before any considerable damage was done to my psyche. I grabbed it away from him and he's like "well duh Sarah, I wouldn't have read it." I said, "oh, so I can trust you with it?" "Yes, you can trust me to steal it and give it back without reading it." Okay, WHAT IS THE POINT IN STEALING IT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO READ IT? Unless you're acting like an elementary school student, where the boys steal the girls' things because they have secret crushes. It's sort of cute when you're in the third grade but when you are a sophomore in high school, the whole "tee hee! let's steal Sarah's crap and run into the boys bathroom because it will be funny" thing should have lost it's appeal.....  But maybe that's just me.    In other news, there was a huge bee stuck in the light in my bathroom. It's one of those light bulbs with the cover on it so when it is turned on, it casts a sort of glow over the bathroom and makes it seem like you are in a cheap motel. Somehow, a bee got into the covering. And for those of you who are unaware, I am terrified of bees, mainly because when they fly around, they always manage to fly at my head with a look on their face that says "I am going to sting you in the eye, and you will like it." I didn't know it was a bee until I forced my dad to come down and look at it (it's in the basement). I thought it was a fly at first... I went down there to brush my teeth and I heard this weird "Bzzzmmmmzzzeeee" noise accompanied by the noise moths make when they run into the glass doors that are right next to your porch light. I thought it was the toilet before I noticed that it was actually a bug, which isn't as strange as it sounds because the toilets that are in our house are conspiring against all of us, but then I noticed this big black thing flying around in the light covering, which is above the toilet. When I noticed it, I thought "wow, that is one big fly" but then I thought that the wings were too big, so it must be a moth. Moths are sort of freaky anyway, because they fly around desperately, saying "Help me! I don't know what to do with myself, I shouldn't be alive." (By the way, I was at Elizabeth's house a while ago and somehow a moth got into her kitchen and I was really scared that it was going to fly into my glass of milk, so I put a napkin over the top of it. I just hate moths.) Anyway, I went upstairs and said to my dad "there is a huge bug stuck in the light in the basement." If you thought I was going to take care of it myself, you were wrong. (Note to anyone thinking about becoming my future husband: you better not be afraid of bugs, especially not of bees, spiders, and moths, because if one gets in the house YOU are going to be the one that kills it.) My dad came down and, upon inspection, announced "that is a really big bee." Upon which I announced "I am getting out of here."   It's dead now. My dad took the covering off the light, swatted it with a newspaper, and grabbed it with a kleenex and flushed it down the toilet before it could recover. Or so I heard. Is it just me, or is there a large amount of satisfaction to be found in the knowledge that that bee drowned in a toilet?
