I can't tell you where we're coming from, but I can say very poetically, yet truly, that we come from a place that reeks of decay and fright, a dead fear of something we can't give a name to.  Ah yes, normal. A term used by the failed experiment called psychology to encompass an average. Who defines normal? It's the same people that define what certain words mean. Who defines what "pen" means? Did you all read "Frindle"? If so, you'd know the answer. It was a person, the same creature that breaths, fucks, shits, eats, just like all the rest of us, no different, no more safe from dying, getting lucky, or anything than any of the rest of us. It's someone that still has a seizure threshold, has to pay taxes, keeps a circadian rhythm, all that good shit. Normal is over-rated and pointless.  No one can see inside like this, we may be outcasted to some extent...so what? We already talked about this before, yet still, this might be good for everyone else to hear: why bleed yourself over someone that's going to think they're better than you because you have a "problem"? The only difference between us and those people is that ours has a given name in a failed experiment/psychology book. Someone who says they don't have problems is a fucking liar. There's their problem right there: denial of problems. If you don't have them, you will. If you deny them, you're fucked. Life is all about accepting their occurance and taking them as they come, depressed as one could be or no.  I say down with the distinction, I say fuck psychology and their godawful classifications, I say separate the diagnosis branch from the treatment branch, because its current incarnation is causing all within it quite a bit of isolation, self-doubt. It's in some people's nature to doubt everyone else, this is only making it worse.  Yet still, they will not, no one's really listening to me, really. All I can tell you is my two favorite words in the whole world when it comes to things like this: FUCK IT. Fuck them, sorry you all, but fuck you. If you don't like me, blow me. If you can't deal with it and shut the fuck up about it, even if you were my best friend before, then suck on my goddamn goads because you are a complete fucking retard. And people, that's just the way it goes, that last sentence may have been a bit abrasive, but that's what everyone really needs to hear: the cold, hard truth of it, just like life really is. It might be better for some of us to hear it that way rather than me just pussy-footing around it with demure, blasé language than to tell it to you with all the hatred and anger I can conjure from myself, and I did. You need to hear that I don't care who you are, I don't care how many of you have to go before I get it all straight: if you can't accept it, then you're the one that has problems, you're not helping me and I don't need you, and more over, you're not helping yourself.  I can see the day people like that wake up and figure out: "oh my god, what have I done?" That awful, awful day you come to realize that everyone is the same, everyone's fucked up as you are, nobody understands a motherfucking thing, everyone's drowning in something. Yeah, we all are. But the fun of life is taking that next big breath, and if we can respect everyone's right to take it, and respect the fact that no one really can have real dignity while they're drowning, then it's all right.  Life is about the right now, it's about coming to accept that there's a lot of shit here, and the only way to make yourself happy is to do just that: MAKE. No one was put here to give you anything. You can choose your miseries and your elations, even if you're messed up like we are. We can fight the feelings, we don't have to be one way or the other, we can just be ok. I don't have to be manic or depressed, I can just be in the middle. It's not all brain chemistry. If that were the case, we'd never fucking be alright, no one really understand the brain all that well.   Humanity is better than every other species becase we have a choice. Life is about taking that choice and making the most of it, respecting everyone else's choices, and choosing the things that will really make us happy, maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but sometime. And in the mean time, we can life with the happiness of knowing that we made the right decisions. Everything can really work out if you know what your options are.  The secret is just taking a step, whether you know where it leads, whether you can walk or not. MAKE your way, and you can take another great big breath. Hell, one day you may even reach the shore for good.
