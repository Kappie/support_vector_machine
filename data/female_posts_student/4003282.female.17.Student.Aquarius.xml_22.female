But atleast I get to talk to him. I'm so tired. I haven't had a good sleep since band started. Oh well.      I hate having to go to work. I don't wanna go at 3 today. This sucks. I wanna go shopping but I don't have money. Arg. Maybe I should go get my pay check and then go back at 3. But I kinda wanna sleep in. I only worked 3 days on my check. I didn't clock in one day. Arg. I'm so stpupid. I didn't realize it till I got home. Oh well.      I"M NOT  SINGLE  NO MORE AND I'M ROCKIN IT LIKE A BOAT. Lol.      I've got the  best boy  in the world. I  love  you, Josh.
