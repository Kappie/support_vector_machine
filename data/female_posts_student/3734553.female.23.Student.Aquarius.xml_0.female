The first one was when we were hanging out with his sisters and I said something silly or I didn't understand an inside joke, something along those lines, and he was messing up my hair, like you would a little kids hair, saying, "Its okay ryan, its okay." In this voice that he would use to play with me.  And everyone was laughing and forgot for a few minutes that he was leaving soon.  The second one is my favorite.  The last three days before he left I stayed at his house with his family, and we hadn't left each others side since I quit my job.  It was his last night and we, his family and me, where supposed to have a last dinner together.  Being Evan he had waited to pack until the night before his 5 am flight, so dinner kept being pushed back.  I had gone home to shower and clean up for supper and when I got back to his house he was in the middle of unpacking everything because his mother had packed it the first time and not everything fit into his one bag.  But he was determined to make it all fit. He was frustrated with his mom and concentrating on the best way to go about cramming two years worth of supplies into one backpack.  His hair had grown long and I pulled it back into a ponytail for him.  He had banned his family from the room, telling them to get ready for dinner.  I was sitting in a chair across the room from him.  He had his arms on his hips and was frowning, looking down at the floor, which was completely covered with clothes and food and batteries.  And then he looked up at me and he broke into this huge grin. And it is just that one moment, the change in his face when he saw me watching him, that I keep playing over in my mind.  He was so happy, and perfect for me in that one moment.  I wonder if that person still exists.  or if time, distance, and Africa has made him hard and bitter.  I can't imagine him as being bitter, just saddened by all the death he is witnessing.  I just want him to be happy. and to miss me.
