She put me in that state, where I don't know, I really wish I did now.  But now I really do want to rape her."  Way to fucking be, cock pirate.  Anywho, while we're on the topic of angry young men make sure you go check out  urlLink Tazz's Blog .  Its not very aesthetically pleasing, but his rants will make you lauhg your ass off once he gets going.
