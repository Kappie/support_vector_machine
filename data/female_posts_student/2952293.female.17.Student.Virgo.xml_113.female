You guys, seriously, I'm going crazy. I was with my mom, then jetted off to spend time with my dad, then came home to deal with my aunt. I cannot take any more adults! The last time I saw a friend was when Anna and I went to see Maxeen in Cleveland. Well, I guess this is a perfect time to blog. Yesterday my aunt and I took the BART (a metro/subway type thing) into San Francisco. We walked around this ferry museum and then headed up to Chinatown. They had some good free stuff. After that we walked to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. That was awesome! Check out their website to see some of their stuff. Then we got on the cable cars/trolley and took it up to Fisherman's Wharf. We took a boat ride along the bay up to Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. It was really cold, and this little boy on the boat had no teeth, but it was a nice view. Before we got on the boat, we saw all these people standing and watching us. We were both wondering what they were doing, and then this man popped out from behind a bush and scared the living daylights out of me! Stupid fuck. We ate dinner around the Wharf. I had a major craving for a hot dog, but instead of ketchup, I put like cocktail sauce or something on my hot dog, so they made me another one. We took a cab back to the BART station. This cab driver was fucking nuts. He never shut up and was going on and on about drugs. Which cities do which drugs, how they do it, where the drugs come from, uhh... who gives a fuck? Maybe you shouldn't take drugs and then drive people around the city a hole. He would swerve out of the lane and go right onto oncoming traffic, and then pull over at the last second. Yeah... but we made it and got back. Today her friends took us on a driving tour. We stopped up at USF, since I don't know where to go on Monday when I take my tour. Then we went around Golden Gate Park and up to Ocean Beach. The Atlantic is way better than the Pacific. The fog was pretty thick, though, so that probably wasn't the ocean's best day. We ventured into this park where you can take really great pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, but the fog was so thick that you couldn't see one part of the bridge. We did walk on the bridge a little and you couldn't see the sides, so it was pretty scary. Then we drove up to the light house on Coit Island, or something like that, and took pictures. After, we headed down Lombard Street, otherwise known as the Crookedest Street, and yes, it was quite crooked. We came upon this road that literally dropped straight down. Barb was like, "No Al, oh no, Al, omg no!" And he did. He ZOOMED straight down to all our screaming! We then headed to Ghiradelli Square and got lost in the chocolate chaos. Finally, we went up to this Chinese restaurant for dinner and came home. Tomorrow I think we're going up to Mount Diablo, yeah, I could care less about that shit. I miss home.
