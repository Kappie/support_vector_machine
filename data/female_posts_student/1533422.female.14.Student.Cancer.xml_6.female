Like, when she said, "Why are you pissed off with me?" I said, "Does Tom have MSN?"  There was an actual reason for me saying that, but I don't think she got it.    Anyway, she's talking to me now because my MSN name is, ":'( :'( My little Smellykins!" and she wanted to know what was wrong with Smelly.  (Smelly's my pet cockatiel, and she's just been diagnosed with diabetes.) I think we're both kind of tense ... if she's still pretending to be in L.A., I know for a fact she's in England.  She rang Pooj, and it was her home number when Pooj did 1471.    So find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files, you must follow, leave this academic factory, you will find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee is miiiine! Yes it's miiiine!    Lol, how catchy is that song?  *~Jools~*  Oh yeah, Sean, if you're reading this, my sister's probs going to invite you to her birthday party. =D I'm getting a swirly pink skirt for it cuz it's a 50s party.
