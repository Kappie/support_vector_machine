Did I mention that I've only had about one semester of one hour a week sessions in tap dancing. whoa nelly! Oh how my muscles are aching..even the ones that run alongside your leg bone below the knee. Man, I'm stiff too. Ack! I'm getting old! Blast you ever avenging 23! AAAAaaahh only 36 days 'til my birthday. Aaagh. Ok I think I'm done now. Night. ;)
