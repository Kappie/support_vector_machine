I spent the entire time having mad crazy cool fun (in a non-dirty way.... most of the time) with Kacie and Pat (yeah i know i wasn't too happy about that part either) It was hilarious. We spent like the entire trip making crude sex jokes. That's the only way to go. Like we saw this display with like a woman bending down making something or whatever and this other person standing up on the other side of the display like i dunno standing there, and then this random goat. It was amazing. And i'm like, it would be so easy to rearange those people to make it sex-oriented. And pat's like "yeah just put the standing person behind that other woman" and i'm like "don't forget the goat!" It was amazing. It was hilarious. And then we are all looking at this mummy thing and like this fat kid thing comes up and it's like "can you please move so I can see" and then it's chaparone (sp?) thing was like "michael you could have just come around on this side" and we're all like "I thought it was a girl!" And we're like well maybe it's like that guy on Gilmore Girls, Michelle. Only it's a girl and it's name it Michael. So we called it Michelle from then on. Good stuff. Then we saw the greek exhibit and there was this statue with a little carving thing on the front which was a dick with like wings or something. It was so bizarre. It even said on the little card thing on the side that it was "male genitalia" we're like "horny bastards" We also talked a while about how Mr. Samilenko was sad and when he was talking about water hardness he said "I like it hard in the shower" or something like that that gave the same effect. I carried my water bottle from lunch around for a while but then i didn't feel like it holding it anymore so i was like "pat be useful hold my water for me" i didn't think he would acutally do it, but he did. He put it in his pocket and I'm like "ew, I don't want your pocket water!"We laughed for days. good times. Also Mutter museum, very icky. Things in jars. Eye's with toothpicks in them. LOTS of siamese twins.
