And if it wasn't for her hating him right now, I could be holding a nice lil' red heart with mindless gay profanities upon it, myself braindead and bleeding upon the floor, a crunch-ed and broken mess of a human. HAHA YES, IT WAS RIPPED TO SHREDS. Thankyouthankyouthankyou Leigh Anne.  Why can't the faggots leave me alone?  And just what side of the tree is this guy climbing down anyway?  Whatever.
