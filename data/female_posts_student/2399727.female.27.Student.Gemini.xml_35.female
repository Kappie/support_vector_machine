My new roommates are fabulous and we're getting along very well.  Quiet and clean; my type of gals.  I have been doing a lot of reading of Robertson Davies' novels for work lately.  They are thoroughly enjoyable and I wish I could spend more time with them rather than skimming through for vague references to Wagner.  Big snow storm in this area today.  We are expected to get a total of 30cm of snow by tomorrow evening, and maybe some ice pellets in the morning which should make travel miserable.  I have been volunteering at a new place now.  Out of the Cold serves soup and sandwiches to hungry men and women in Toronto.  Everyone there is really great.  More to come...
