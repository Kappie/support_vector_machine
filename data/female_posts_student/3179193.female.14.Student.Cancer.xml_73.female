Sure, I've been a lazy ass for most of the band practises, just sitting out but wow... this time is just total coolness. We need to get Julie here though~! Safee too! He can scream, I hear. Nima's mom is really cool. So's Moca's mom. Dude, they're friendly. It's a lot cooler when you mom can speak english you know? Oh well, my mom's cool too in her own special way. :) I love my mommy. Anyways... Yeah. Phew... still worrying over my Sudbury Semi-Formal outfit... don't know what to do for it. *sighzZ* Guys have it easy... a nice shirt with nice pants and shoes with gelled hair and that's it. Girls, we need to find the outfit's that's JUST RIGHT~! Julie and I are going shopping at Markville this coming Saturday. Hopefully. I want Nima to come... I know I know... Guys don't like going shopping but if I try something on, I want to know if Nima likes it. Plus, I'd get to spend time with him... which is something I'd do anything for. If I get to spend time with him or if he's there, I'd go for sure... If capable. Well, I gotta run. Chores chores chores... :D Can't wait till next band practise... maybe we can call an extra band practise at Nima's place this week? :P We can plug the mic into his piano amp or whatever. I could also ask Gordon if we can borrow his electric drumpad. Total coolness. Anyway... Gotta run. Buna seara all! Arrive derci~ (I think that's how you spell it) Anyway... peace out! Love y'all...! Especially you ;)
