As  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  pointed out, "The poem is rooted in the notion that the ideal of American freedom was a lie from the beginning for many people, and that public ownership of private property was the only hope:   I am the young man, full of strength and hope, Tangled in that ancient endless chain Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land! Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need! Of work the men! Of take the pay! Of owning everything for one's own greed!   Then there's this:   Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death, The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies, We, the people, must redeem The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers. The mountains and the endless plain-- All, all the stretch of these great green states-- And make America again!    Not  that this really needs to be pointed out. I think if you read the poem it becomes fairly obvious.   And  this  is what Kerry is quoting. A poem from a man who wanted to abolish private property and loved Stalin. Heh. Nice. You would think that a person might want to understand something, before they say it. But that's just me. Call me crazy.
