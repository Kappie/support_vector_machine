I'm just different and it's finally hitting me how much everyone else has changed [[or havent changed in some cases]]  Not exactly sure how i feel about this.  Overall, thankfully, i feel like ive changed for the better [[even tho its hard to feel as smart @ RCHS unlike @ east where i could easily shine w/o trying]] I just..i dno I'm more dedicated to what i want now and just...my personality is changing.  I no longer place so much value on what other pple say, what other people think.  I know the truth and thats all that should matter, I know why i do the things i do.  Yes, i still have times when i care way too much about other pple's opinions and other pple still hold the power to hurt me more than maybe they 'should' but it's not the same as it usedta be. It just kinda hit me that I've developed my own views about life more this year than ever before.  Yes, I'm also still very...'me' or the way i was i just! AH! i dno how to explain it! Think about where you were a year before now and what you might have been thinking, feeling.  In my case, it's a helluva lot different than now, everything is.
