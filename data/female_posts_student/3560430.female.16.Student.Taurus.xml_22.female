And then it took me way over a minutes past the bell to finish my term two test. And now I know that I did poorly on that, so I'm going to rejoice if I pass that. There goes my oppertunity to raise my mark. And now I want to cry because I spent hours studying for the term one test, and I didn't get to sleep till about 1:45 last night, and I'm so tired I can't even read, and I want to sleep but I have a science final tomorrow and AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Yes that feels better. Must go now I can manage a two hour nap if I go to bed now.
