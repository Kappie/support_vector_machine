Apparently Karen doesn´t really speak spanish, she said she can sort of understand it.  WHATEVER.  This could get interesting.  Anyway, now they wanna be my buds after totally treating me like crap.  Not gonna happen.  My roomate´s name is Fernanda, she is from Brazil.  I like her alot.  Did I mention classes started today?!  Yeah, uh I thought they were short, not really. I was up until 1am last night and didn´t even finish reading, although we didn´t get anywhere near through the reading, and I was just exhausted when I got up at daybreak.  Class starts at 9 am and they are 1 hr and 50 min long, back-to-back!!!! Every day of the week!!!  Dean Piatt is being really cool, everyone likes him and he is totally laid back.  I did some laundry last night but getting it to dry has been an ordeal.  I am going to go shopping this week, in the afternoon, in Madrid, I need more clothes on hand if washing has to be done in such a difficult manner.  Oh well, I have never complained about too many clothes.  My Sandra Day O´Connor materials were just fedexed to me thanks to the lovely dean.  Sweeeeet more books to carry. Will somebody please email me?  I feel like you all forgot about me?! DON´T.
