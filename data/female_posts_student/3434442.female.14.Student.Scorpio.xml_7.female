Last night me, Lennon, Josh, Don, Cassidy, and Dylan went to the mall.  I think Josh and Dylan felt left out considering they were the only single people there :*( Josh is a great guy, hes the one who acctually hooked me and Lennon up, and if it wasn't for him, we (as in me and Lennon) would probably not exist.  We had a great time yesterday I think.  The end was especially nice for me. Lol.  Me and Lennon all kinda cuddly and junk.  I almost fell asleep from so much comfort. Evil pyro people who like to cause death to things kept being rude and mean... grr! Dylan threw pennies at people as usual... particularly me and Lennon and Josh.  He says he "seriously was trying to hit the wall and not us." Yeeeeeah, suuuuure. Anywhit, tomarry is the last day for Anime Club *tear*.  But hey, I get to see Lennon and Josh again! YAY! Thinking 'bout wearing a skirt... hmmm... eh well since my comp sucks (!!!) I guess I should go ahead and post this before it locks up on me like it frequently likes to do! Much love!  ~Nicole/Nikki/whatevertheheckyouwannacallme~
