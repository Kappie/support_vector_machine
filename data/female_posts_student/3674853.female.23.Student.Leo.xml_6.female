Addiction is bad for your health! 4. Do not cling, act needy or demand. Doormats are for your feet, not your heart. 5. It's OK to say NO! 6. Stop talking so much. NEVER reveal everything. 7. Do not grill them or their friends for information. 8. Master the art of LISTENING. 9. Treat him/her as you would your best friend. 10. Friendship creates long term love and comes before sex. 11. FORGET about fixing your partner. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 12. Your choice of partner is a reflection of who you are and who you are not! 13. Enjoy the moment first. Live in the present. 14. Don't worry about the ex's or start naming your future children. 15. NEVER read their journal or go through their paperwork. 16. If you have no trust, you have no relationship. 17. Allow space and freedom between you. 18. DO NOT always be available. 19. Calling frequently is a turn off and signals insecurity, neediness and control. 20. Open your eyes to lies and cheating, OR... close them...justify the bad behaviour, and live with the consequences. 21. Little or no eye contact? Start walking. They won't even notice your gone. 22. Anyone preoccupied with their physical appearance and dress, usually have very little or nothing to offer from within. Look beyond the physical! 23. Never compromise your values. 24. If you OVER give, you will lose your lover and her/his respect. 25. DO NOT LOSE YOUR IDENTITY. 26. If someone REALLY wants to be with you, they will be. 27. State your personal rules in the very beginning or expect them to be broken. 28. If they ask to be just friends, be just that and look elsewhere for a love partner. 29. If someone wants to really be with you, they will. If they keep giving reasons for not calling or say they are extremely busy, GET THE HINT, leave them alone. 30. Don't ever give up your friends for him/her. 31. If your partner one day leaves you, be sure you have friends, money, a career and a life of your own which you never gave up. If you do not, who do you have to blame but yourself!  All of us will only pass this lifetime once...we owe it to ourselves to make the most out of it... Its nice to see when we look back that WE LIVED WELL  LOVED BEST!!!
