I'm going to see them tonight and I can't wait!! Ug I am gonna spoil this kid like no other! My frist nephew!!! And probably my only unless I marry a guy with brothers or sisters but this is MY nephew.... ah I can't beleive it. Birth is a beautiful thing. Like... for a guy its like, I helped make this, but for the woman its like, oh my God, this tiny little person who I'm going to help to grow CAME from ME. It's an amazing thing.... ah I'm so happy.
