I tried for weeks to get the office manager (I use that term very loosely)to put a particular log in ABC order.  We enter information in a log and it's given a reference number.  Well, you can imagine what that log looked like with over 700 employees.  The problem came when we had to look up a reference number.  No one had access to the computer file to search for it that way.  We were supposed to look through this endless report (with a very small font).  Made me want to pull my hair out.  Well, that "office manager" departed and the new one did finally make that change and life is good now.
