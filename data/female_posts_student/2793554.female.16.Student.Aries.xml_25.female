I love abby. wait... that came out wrong. this is dylan...updating abbys blog. but shhh. anyway i love her. even though she wrote "dylans a fucking geek" and tried to pass it of as meaningful. even though spawns hotter.  i swear on my vagina, dylan will not get sex for a very very long time. I will go find some really hot british NOT GEEKY man and have SO MUCH SEX with him but dylan wont care because he loves spawn more than he loves me and IF HE LOVES SPAWN SO MUCH, HE SHOULD FRIGGIN MARRY HIM!!!  How i loath that future british swine bag. Who shall i call upon to enact justice? spawn is the obvious choice as an angry nationalist new yorker. but he is weak to foreigners as show when the itallian mob rocked him back to hell. mabey venom would stand a better chance against that bad british hygiene. but hes vulnerable to sound and many british accents hurt. badly.  ...and there the geek goes, talking and talking about geeky comic book characters... all you girls (and guys with geeky girlfriends ) out there, NEVER. EVER. buy your boyfriend/girlfriend a cool action figure cause it will TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE AND EAT YOUR BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND AND THEN YOU WILL GO AFTER A NICE NON GEEKY PERSON BUT THEN IT IS TOOOOOO LAAAAATE!  All i have to say is. Have you seen the cover of spawn issue 43? imagine an action figure of that.  Yes, spawn is cool. which is why dylan loves him more than me. Maybe if i had a cool red cape and a comic book after me about how i was the spawn of hell, he would love me too......  I WILL SEX YOU UP SO HARD!!!!  psh.   sex. later people.   dylan and abby  p.s. if you havent read the new venom series in issue six wolvee shows up and then in issue seven wolvee gets nuked. BAD ASS!
