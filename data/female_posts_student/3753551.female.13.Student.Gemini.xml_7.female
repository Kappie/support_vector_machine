Funeral for a Friend is my favourite band of all time and I seriously feel like saying that IM IN LOVE WITH FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND. I woke up this morning and played the entire album 'casually dressed and deep in conversation' (buy it if you think you have taste) and then I posed infront of my mirror, as you do, playing my guitar (I found this quite difficult so I did it with an imaginary guitar instead. I found myself looking fairly hip and groovy.) And then after that i went into the lounge, bunged on the fire and started playing a song that my friend made up and taught to me yesterday night on the phone. The song is now probably the coolest thing I can play on my guitar. Im learning Bullet Theory on the geetar now too but its bloody hard. But until i learn that, that song will be coolest.  Heres a picture of them at the Kerrang! Awards 2003... they won best new band... it was well deserved.     Heres a pic of them all looking amazingly hot. Matt Davies has caused me dehydration through loss of saliva due to drooling.
