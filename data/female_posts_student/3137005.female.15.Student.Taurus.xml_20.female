I love the Corrs!!!!  'I've been called many things in my life, but never a vicious, cold-blooded piece of toast.' From the ever wonderful Cassandra Claire, may she find happiness, riches and the solitude of a hut where she will be chained to a computer table and forced to write forever more!!!  Anyway....Yay! Dani is happy, everyone is friends *does the friendly dance*. Oh We're like sesame street, they're all friends too! Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanna live on sesame street, I 'd be soo good, coz I can count and I know the alphabet so nothing would be confusing at all. Just very Jolly and understandable.  The cookie monster!!!
