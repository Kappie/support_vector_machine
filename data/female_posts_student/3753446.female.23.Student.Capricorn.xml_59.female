Very few people outside of my immediate family have ever seen me cry. Recently, as you know, I was scared shitless doing things like riding Top Thrill Dragster and jumping out of planes, but still, even cheating death, I didn't cry.  Today I cried in public. I don't know what came over me. I have been studying madly for this shelf board exam (think of it as a year end cumulative) that is coming up in a couple days. I know my stuff, more or less, but the review is a grueling process. So, my dad calls me this morning as I was studying at Cup O Joe, and as soon as he said "How are you?" IT ALL CAME OUT. I didn't bawl or nothin. But the tears, they flowed. In the coffeeshop! I hated medschool and I hated not knowing things and I hated the stress of having to get a 62% or above to stay in the game. It was all irrational and pointless, but it felt SOOO good to let it out, and so uncomfortable that people were there. My dad was understanding about it though, having been through the spiel himself. He told me to remember my past successes and that hey, I have a degree in Biochemistry so I shouldn't worry about that section. Oy vay. CWRU taught me a lot of details about Biochemistry, but they did a great job of ignoring some fundamentals. Anyway, so I feel a lot better now. Still focused and still gunning. Just wanted to share my moment with y'all.  Now its time to break out the sushi with my favorite Bash.
