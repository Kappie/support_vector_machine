So the thing that gives you cancer (MELANOMA) are the UV's from the sun, riiiiight....  So then WHY on EARTH would you want strong forms of that UV at close proximity to your face and body?  And from LIGHT BULBS?  How can we as educated, intelligent people feel that this makes any sense?  I mean you can say its the pot calling the kettle black in that I don't get an opinion because I smoke... and fine go ahead and say that, you have that right just as I can rant on my blog about the potentially useful brain cells that are wasted when the thought process occurs for one to purchase an "all you can tan for x dollars" and feels that this is a "GOOD DEAL".    Seriously though now that I've ranted about the evils of having that much condenced sun harnessed into a little coffin like box and blasted at your soft skin for 15+ straight minutes.  There was an article in the Toronto Star today that warns against the dangers of the fake and bake.  Which in my opinion besides the evils of things like the CANCER there are things like LEATHER SKIN and WRINKLES and best of all NO ONE TANS ORANGE IN REAL LIFE... but sorry, back to the Star (E8) tanning has gotten so out of control in places like California that the state has actually propsed to pass a LAW against tanning.  Yes folks its come to this, a law against everything...  Listen up though; the article reports such things as "mounting medical research that links the activity to serious health problems"  "after and eight (yes 8)year study of Scandanavian women who frequent tanning booths users were 55 percent (55 that's more then half) more likely to develop malignant melanoma then non-users".  Yup that's right malignant melanoma is also known as THE BIG C...  And after doing a little research and finding out that not only is melanoma the worst kind of skin cancer its none to pretty either.  So this LAW IN CALIFORNIA that they are trying to have passed is thinking of imposing a $2,500 fine a day on salons should minors be caught tanning, that is anyone under the age of 18.  BECAUSE ITS BAD...  Point is, I could probably quote the article word for word and it may make a difference but it may also not make a lick of difference so if you want to borrow the paper just ask.  Think about this, next time your yellowed ass asks me to stop smoking why don't we each sit side by side and wait to meet one another at the cancer ward instead.  Then we can have a battle of the whits or a battle of who's better and healthier then whom or even a who's cancer is better (not funny) until we rot away from years of abuse regarless of the sunstance.  No I haven't quit smoking yet but it doesn't mean that I can't have an opinion, kettle or not.  There are so many ways to get cancer without actually messing with the outside or inside of our body's why do we give it help (myself included)?  I mean a very special friend of mine has hodgekins and she didn't do anything, she just stood there and it got her anyway (love ya Wilson), but its not going to beat her!!!  I would like to say I like me the way I came out, but I don't think I had black lungs when I was born nor a slightly enlarged liver, I'm just as aweful to the skin I'm in as the next guy so instead I end with this.  Make decisions based on whatever, stupid they may be, but make them informed and try for a while, to not force your decisions on others, because like the cliche, the grass is always greener and no one is perfect just because you think it makes sense (like I do this whole tanning bed thing) others may not see it that way.  Rant done for now...
