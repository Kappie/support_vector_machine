Why give great happiness, then make things change? Why make me make the little things big? Why let my mind do this? The happiness can be good, but the pain is so masking. Why are the tough times so tough? Please make them easier. I can turn the happiness on and off, well no not really. I can choose who I want 2 show. Maybe I subconciously want the person 2 find out. But the depressivness is never really turned off, just masked. Only people who really know me can tell the difference. Is the happiness there or is it a masked game. Gosh, I just really need you here with me right now....
