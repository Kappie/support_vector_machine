My vision has only been getting worse and my headaches have gotten worse as well with my conteuned use of my glasses. I have made some inquiries into the Hardly school for the blind. It's one of those schools that will send you the material so you do not have to go to where they are. I can learn braille and so much more. This is a huge step for me. I need to stop wearing my glasses all the time but I am so use to .. no.. I want to keep what little vision I have that I am willing to hurt myself more to keep it selfishly for a few more years even though it is not right or good for me. So I plan to put my enlargment program back on the computer and start working with it more. I plan on going without my glasses more often. I can do this I just do not like the pity people tend to give me when I am out, people tend to try to help to much and that irritates me alot. Also so many people are so use to me doing things here that the adjustment will be hard on them. No more leaving things laying around. I think we can do it together as a family. My biggest problem is the fact that I hate it when people want to smother me in trying to help. I dont know what to do. I know I have to give up the glasses more and more but I do not want to give up what little independance I have. As sad as it sounds in a way it would have been better if I had lost all my vision though I am thankful for that not happening.    On a positive note I do have alot to thank AC about. One of my biggest problems was the fact I did not want to have to go alone in life being disabled (shudder I hate that word) and honestly could not view anyone caring for a "blind" woman. For some reason I know it will not make a big difference to him for so many reasons. He has given me the courage to go through with this and for that I am thankful. It's funny AC always tells me that I give him courage and that I have helped him so much in his life with my friendship when he doesnt even begin to see what he has done for me. I hope soon I can show him. He has restored my faith in so much even when I doubt I have faith it's amazing. My whole world has slowly turned for the better thanks to his friendship and I know it will only get better with his love next to me. I hope that each day he learns a bit more of how important he is to me. I hope he never realizes how much he has done for me becuase that would mean things have came to a stand still and I never want that to happen. He means the world to me.     Last night I almost died laughing. Never send men to do shopping. Dave and Matt brought food into the house. Frozen pizza's, two HUGE bags of chips, they did get bread and milk and cheese (YAY)and they got two HUGE packs of hamburger meat and on top of that they got me a chocolate cream pie. Dave made sure NO ONE touched it because it was for ME only because I have helped out so much he wanted to get me a treat and knows I like chocolate. how do I tell him I dont care for pie ? Lol I am touched but really wished he had put that money towards other things. (smile) I could think of so much more it could have gone towards. ok granted it is only 6 dollars but I do not want feel comfortable with someone doing something like that to "spoil" me for just being myself. He told me to get over it and that I needed to learn to be spoiled sometimes. I know he's right but I still find it weird.    Well I'm off to finish the dishes, to install that program (procrastinating on that one can you tell?) and do a bit around the house. I can take my glasses off to do the house work. This is going to be hard. I think I am going to ask Travis when he is here to keep my glasses so I can learn to go without them otherwise it is to much of a tempation to put them on. WOW did I blog today :)
