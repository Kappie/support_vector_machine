So, in that spirit, today's post is from Judges 12:6:             Then they said unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he                    could not frame to pronounce it right.   Shibboleth was a password, used to distinguish members of one tribe from members of another, who pronounced it Sibboleth (those of you who watch The West Wing are probably familiar with this story).  In other words, as one of my professors says (in albeit a different context), "You can't fake this stuff."  Faith cannot be faked, and if you try to fake it, you will be found out in the end.  It will be obvious to God, as obvious as a mispronunciation.  That being said, I don't shove my beliefs down other people's throats.  I post here who I am, my thoughts and my feelings.  If you like it, fine; if you don't, it's equally fine.  Or, in the words of one of my fellow classmates:  "I don't judge; I just accept."  Share your thoughts all you want, call me crazy for anything I write here.  The quote above is meant to address the intracacies of all kinds of faith, for all of us, not just faith in God, and not just for those who are religious in any way.  After all, even the Bible says that Love is greater than Faith.
