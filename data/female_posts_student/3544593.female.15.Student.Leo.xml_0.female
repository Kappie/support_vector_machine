True friendship is a plant of slow grow, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation."  -George Washington     "An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come."  -Victor Hugo   We are told never to cross a bridge until we come to it, but this world is owned by men who have 'crossed bridges' in their imagination far ahead of the crowd."  -Anon.   "Good, better, best; never let it rest till your good is better and your better is best."  -Anon.
