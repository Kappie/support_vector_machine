Let me try and remember the big points, then I can start afresh with no guilt.  *We had three bead classes, and made up a ton of kits, so that took a lot of time. I have really gotten back into beads, with a serious passion. I haven’t been this excited about them for a while.  *We have still been doing tennis, so that’s cool.  *I have worked a couple days at Dad’s, so that was boring as usual.  *I am considering joining up with my old dance group again, that’s completely weird because when I quit I vowed never to join again. But eh, I guess the dance just wants out.  *I have decided to paint my walls tope and buy all those old movies posters I have been dreaming about, they include but are not limited to: Casablanca, Rear Window, Notorious, Singing in the Rain, and most importantly…The Godfather.  *We went to Adventureland as a fam, had an okay time and now we can live until next summer free of guilt from the parental units. They will not be allowed to pull “You didn’t even go to Adventureland with us this year.” Out and use it as blackmail. We have them now.  *Okay, through quite an unfortunate, insane, barely believable turn of events, Zach and I are no longer friends. I wish I could just pour out the whole thing here, but that’s not fair to him. Baisically what it bolied down to was him completely dumping me as a friend because he didn’t agree with my view on something, I was willing to accept our differences, but he didn’t care enough I guess. So ther we have it, he just slapped me out of his life. This is the first time I have ever been rejected by a firend that I actually cared about, and I guess it was just more shock then anything. Ug, if you don’t know the story then it probably makes no sense. Lets just say I got the smack layed down on me, and for no good reason whatsoever.  Oh I guess that’s good enough, I know I did more stuff though, my brain is just too fried to think about it. I am going to try and be better in the future. Promise.
