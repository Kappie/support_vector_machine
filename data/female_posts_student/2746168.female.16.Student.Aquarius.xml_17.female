Yesterday was the Fourth of July, so we all went to this big ol' fancy-shmancy party...'cept for Alafair, cuz she got sick. Bum. But me n' Lizzie were so bored that we walked home after an hour and chilled with Alafair, watchin'  Independence Day . If you wanna hear about the party, tell Dad or someone to post. All I'll say is that the hamburgers were the only good part.  Anyway, on to more important things...like...um...today! We had  huevos rancheros  for breakfast, which is basically a fried egg on a tortilla slathered in picante sauce. (Yum!) I got/have  tourista , the diarrhea that tourists often get from the unfamiliar microbes down here, but then I took some medicine and have been pretty OK all day. We went to the market to do our Christmas shopping, and since I'm totally inadequate at picking out gifts, Laura helped me. My person and the gifts they're getting from me are--  *A motorcycle speeds down the street, drowning out all sound.*  --pesos. Neat, huh? I just need to wrap 'em all now. Gotta find a box to put 'em in...  Oh! At the market yesterday, I bought the COOLEST paperweight. I don't know if it's supposed to be one, but I love it. I should've taken a picture of it to upload, but I didn't. It's pretty much just a big hunk of glass that's been dyed green and cut like a gemstone, but I love it. It's maybe half the size of my fist and has all these pretty inclusions and bubbles inside of it. Reminds me of the "sunstones" from those  Dinotopia  books I read as a kid. SHINY THINGS RULE!  What else? Well, there's not a lot to say about what I've been up to...just working on my website. I love doing it; I can't explain why. It's just so rewarding to see myself build something from scratch without anybody's help. I dunno what the rest of the family's been up to...Ben had his first guitar lesson today, I know that much. And...um...Well, I don't keep up with everybody. Sorry.  Other people should post on this thing. Really...This has gotta be boring for everybody who's NOT interested in  me . *decides to poke the others and see if someone else will do at least one entry* I'll tell you all about Christmas tomorrow, at least. Today's Christmas Eve...how very strange.
