Oh and Kayla, I really think you should do the play, it is what you love doing and you are really good at it! And if doing the play and work becomes too much for you, then I would understand where you might consider quitting. But whatever you do, I support you, and just remember to do what you love!  Of course, I know you just have to LOVE working with me too, so if the only reason you would be staying at work was because of me...I would feel really touched. Ahahahaha!  I really don't want to work tonight...but that is only because I have to work with Ben EVERY day this week. Ahhhhhh!  k-
