Well, not exactly.  I didn't exactly ask him out and so technically he couldn't have said no.  But that's kinda what happened.    I said (total pick up line now that I think about it) I wanted to ask you, do you hang around Racine at all?  Or just Oak Creek?  (the last part was a muffled whisper)  He said, just Oak Creek mostly.  I just come here for work.  (this is him rejecting me.  if it were me I would have said not really, why?  you know, leaving room for the big question or suggestion.)  I said, oh.  Then there was silence, but it wasn't awkward.  It was more like how do I go about this now.  Do I just bring up bars in the area and say he should hang out one night.  Or do I just ask him if he wants to hang out one time.  Or do I just take that as a no.  I had one of those moments that I thought only happened to Ally McBeal.  His coworkers came in from smoking.  Well, great.    Did I mention we were in the back room.  Alone.  Anyway we left there and we up front and he said if there's anything else I can help you with call back or something along those lines.  The rejection had set in by then so I wasn't really paying attention.  Then I smiled a defeated smile and said I'm good thanks and he said keep smiling.  Smiled again.  Then I left and hung my head in the car.     What's wrong with me?  Why doesn't the stupid boy like me?  If he knew I called him a stupid boy then I'd understand.  But right now I don't.  And it's annoying.
