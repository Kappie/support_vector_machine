(think of all the OIL we would save) and there's also the benefit of putting money back into the local economy. plus there's something very good about feeling connected to the place you live. you should know where your food comes from.   but. that's all beside the point really.this jar of pickles is from 1998. it's been opened. i'm not sure it's good anymore.
