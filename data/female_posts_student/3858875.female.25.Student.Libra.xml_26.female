This happens every game, and the winner takes home a canadians hat plus two tins of campbell's chunky soup.   this contest featured two teenage boys - the contests tend to pit friend against friend - one was fairly average, and his friend was, well, a pudgy and attention-grabbing. Having stuffed the entire dog in his mouth in the first 'bite,' he was declared the winner. But upon leaving the field, he spat out the dog, and got a huge boo from the crowd. he kept the machismo going.   a few minutes later, his prize was awarded to his friend, to the crowd's roaring approval (loudest cheer of the night!) i have never seen a person deflate like this pudgy kid did.  hopefully gordon c's similarly deflating - i read yesterday that one poll puts the provincial ndp up over the liberals 44 to 33%!   pudgy kid got a prize after he calmed down (and argued with the prize people for at least 10 minutes).   boy do i wish i had this documented on film!
