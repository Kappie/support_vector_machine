To excel in something takes much time to earn.  Hours and hours (japanese: manichi manichi) of practice and of toil.  What do i excel at?  I do not excel.  I try harder.  If i fail, i'll try again and again no matter what.  What i seem to have, is nothing compared to the total potency that a human being has.  Modest, say thou?  Modest?  Nay, i am but trying to say that everyone can do anything as long as they have enough concentraaaa........I HAVEE TO GO SWIMMING! NOOOOOOOO
