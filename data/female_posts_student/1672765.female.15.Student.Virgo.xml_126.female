I don't know if she's listening to them but I guess she at least liked the way they sounded.  you shouldn't just be completely careless and everything but you really have to let things be and just live and take chances, you will get hurt, but if you never take any chance, how do you know that the thing you risk is worth more than you could ever imagine? Didn't cite me but I guess that's alright.
