Not really, just inevitable. But that's ok. Until whatever controls my emotional state decides to calm down, open back up, and forget the past, I can't handle a relationship, I can't even like anyone because once I finally find myself attracted, they run off with some dumbass, bimbo, blonde memeber of one of those fucking rediculous groups of idiots, that depend on having four or more of them all at the same time together, no, James, I am not referring to you nor your girl pack, although I don't doubt that they've got plenty of space in their minds. Anyone who can't depend on themselves and has to travel with twenty airheads should throw themselves off a cliff. Honestly, I kind of hate girls. I can't think of very many that I get along with. My gay guy friends are great. They are like girls without the stupidity, and twice as much common sense. Yes, I'm a girl. No I don't travel in packs. I have friends who are girls, we all get together most of the time with boys as well, and have fun. We don't run around in a pack screeching like god damn monkeys. Thank you god for Chris and Rob and Jessie, these kids are just better then the dumbasses I see everyday.  ARRRGH.  But anyway. I attempted to date. But, thanks to my last few boyfriends, my emotional state and my lack of free time, I knew it wouldn't work. I hate it because I know it would help but I can't make it work. And I feel so bad too, because there is nothing I can do to make it better.  I hate my siblings.  You can have them. For the low low price of lack of privacy, sanity and vocal usage. You can just come and pick them up. Please.  I'm done. "Et Toi, Brute?" "You too, Brutus?" -Caesar.
