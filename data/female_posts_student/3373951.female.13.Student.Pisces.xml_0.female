Just sitting around doing stuff that not necessarily has to do with Tribune. Crap. Might as well not come right??? Aniwaez...*perks up* tomorrow's the last day of school!!! Then I have an angklung camp on 31st May and 1st June but since I'm going overseas, I'm only coming on the first of June. So I get the best of both worlds. Then 3 days later on the 4th June to 5th June I have a Tribune camp, at the end of which there's a Tribune Concert Nite. Thank goodness it's only among the CCA. Imagine me performing at assembly in front of Kak Fadz!!! Can die man...wait...that's a bit the duh right??? Yepz. Aside from that, I have three literature projects and one Malay project to do. FOUR PROJECTS!!! I'm still going overseas you know. I guess it basically takes up the whole of my SPLENDID June holidays. I have been overwhelmed with unrivalled joy beyond wurdz. Sheesh...and I'm still in Sec One for goodness' sake!!!!What do they take us for? Machines that never go out of power? Machines who work they metal asses off??? Honestly...and they say they're from RGS. It brings such honor to the name, doesn't it???Hm?   gtg sulk n die.  Buhz.
