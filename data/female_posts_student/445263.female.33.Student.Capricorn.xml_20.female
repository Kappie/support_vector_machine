I spend hours (well, minutes) putting together some sort of nonsense for this meaningless blog in the hope that millions across the world will rush over to read my nonsense, to no avail ... and then we check out an ancient website that Katie created last year, that we haven't even thought about for months, to discover that she has had over SIX THOUSAND hits and has 564 messages waiting in her guest book!   We're presuming that she must have been selected as Page of the month or something, going by what some of the messages say, but isn't listed in the site's winners list ... and her page was registered at an old email address of mine that doesn't function any more, so we'll never know. Boo!   urlLink Katie's World!
