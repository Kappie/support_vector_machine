Well then i thought those plans kinda got diminished because Jess couldn't make it and Britt was having problems with her car brakes or whatever....so then i was going to go to Kendra's party BUT then i called my mom and she's like "no you have to babysit dillon" and i'm like agh way to tell me in advance!!!!  So i tell Kendra i can't make it and i'm really sorry.  Then Britty IMs me and is like hey we're still on with plans, i just can't spend the night like the original plan!  Then my mom is like fine whatever, you don't have to babysit.  and i still can't make it to Kenny's party and i feel really bad.  I'm really sorry everyone!!!!!!    Kubic, we can't ice skate/see a movie saturday because i have fathers day plans....sorry!  aagh way to many things to think about!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
