I'm going to go to bed as soon as I get home tonight, because I have to get up early tomorrow so I can get to my 8am flight.  Early meaning about 5am, which is when I usually get up on school days anyway. Well, I need to go find something to wear tonight.  And play piano, and drink milk, both of which I'm not going to have for a month.  *tear*  Oh well, I think I'll live.  See y'all in a month.  Over and Out
