And I keep listening to Wicked Little Town. What a stupendous song. It's quite the pondering song, if you ask me. Not that it's *really* helping, but hey... It's not doing damage, right? Anyways, I'll stop babbeling now. I was going to write about my damn crappy situation some more, but I don't believe I will.
