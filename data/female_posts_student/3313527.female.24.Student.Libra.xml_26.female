There's a scene in the movie that features the song and I used to rewind and replay that one scene over and over again because I just fell in love with the song. And over the course of the week I had the movie rented, I watched it endless times because  I was learning what love felt like   by witnessing the feelings I was having for that River Phoenix character.   In retrospect, there are a lot of movies like this for me, a lot of characters who I have swooned over throughout the years, and they really have this bittersweet affect because they aren't real, people aren't really like that and if they were, they'd be 3-D and have flaws and inconsistencies that make them human. There aren't enough movies that portray love as this textured, oft-frustrating but ultimately meaningful and worthwhile thing. Instead love is portrayed as simple; love is adoration or addiction or obsession and worse yet, love is just good sex. It's difficult to sort through all of these messages and find out what love really is, what it's REAL potentialities are, when all of these 2-D idealizations are out there. What can be expected? What is worth fighting for? What is worth working for? What is settling for too little, what is asking for too much? In a world where divorce is becoming the norm, there aren't enough real-life models of healthy love, of true romantic partnership, to learn from. So instead we grow up watching these movies and thinking that this is what we have to look forward to. These 2-D dramatizations are what love is measured against.   And now,  Kate's Hall of Adoration , movie characters who I have loved over the years. (PS I am using the actors names because I have a terrible memory for movie characters names). (and these are in no particular order). 1. River Phoenix in Running on Empty (and his other silent-brooding typecast roles) 2. Ethan Hawke in Dead Poets Society (the quiet one brought out of his shell) 3. Robert Sean Leonard in Dead Poets Society (pursuing his passion) 4. John Cusack in Say Anything (and subsequent similar roles that I like to think of as grown-up Lloyd Doblers ie his characters in High Fidelity, Gross Pointe Blank) 5. Johnny Depp in Dead Man, Edward Scissorhands, Benny  Joon...  6. Christian Slater- he's worse than Depp, who tends to pick particularly offbeat characters- Slater picked for himself a slew of roles that got me swooning- Gleaming the Cube, Mobsters, Young Guns- first and foremost Pump Up The Volume.  These are the ones that immediately come to mind. Some of the more recent ones are Tobey Maguire in Cider House Rules, The actor in American Beauty who plays the neighbor... but really it's these older movies, because they were the influential ones when I was coming of age.   I read this quote on Amazon.com today which seems to relate:  "The crux of postmodernity is that there are two 'presents'." One is a 'spectre' present, a Virtual Reality techno-media simulacrum that makes the other 'real' present appear borderline, fugitive, elusive." T.R. Cattan   It seems like I am living two lives, also. The 'real' life is the one I am actually living, the earthy physicality of my body; the day-to-day communication with loved ones, etc... and then there is the other one, the 'spectre', which is a fantasy life built on expectations set up for me by falling prey to the influence of media-how I want to look, how I want to be romanced, who I want to love, what I expect from life, what success looks and feels like, etc. Is there any unifying of the two? How?
