I failed my first AP chemistry chapter test ever, and although I had initially believed that I'd learned how to be apathetic about failure or discontent, the sadness kicked in later, but I'm getting over it. Actually, my biggest concern lately is Calculus. Suddenly, I don't understand what's going on anymore. I'm utterly lost. I was supposed to be the math person--therefore, this wasn't supposed to happen. I have a test tomorrow, and I don't even know how I will manage to get through there. My last report card was wonderful, but I am doubting more and more that I'll ever see those beautiful grades in my AP classes again; I'm just too burnt out. I would have needed Christmas break to last at least a month longer than it did, but I only got the two weeks I got. My brain decided then to take a vacation but evidently refused to come home, and I'm struggling.    I just feel quite awful these days. Again. No one, but no thing, either. It's rather sad, as at least earlier I was able to get things done. I need to get my brain back and get it back in gear, though I'm not too sure how that's supposed to happen.   And I'd better hope that the remaining two days of the week won't be as lousy as these first three.    I'm supposed to get All State music tomorrow, as it's come in, finally. I'm really hoping that I will like it, that way I'll work on it with no problem, or something like that anyway. I don't even know what the repertoire is yet. I'm selling candy to fundraise for that, as All State's a buttload of money *sigh*. Fundraisers are kind of annoying. Hopefully, I won't screw that up, too.    "End of a Century" by Blur   She said there's ants in the carpet Dirty like monsters Eating all the morsels Picking up the rubbish Give her effervescence She needs a little sparkle Good morning TV You're looking so healthy  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cause we feel the same We kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of a century...  Oh, it's nothing special  Sex on the TV Everybody's at it And the mind gets dirty As you get closer to thirty Gives her a cuddle They're glowing in a huddle Good night TV You're all made up And you're looking like me  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cos we feel the same And kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of a century...   Oh, it's nothing special  Can you eat her? Yes, you can  We all say Don't want to be alone We wear the same clothes 'Cos we feel the same And kiss with dry lips When we say goodnight End of the century...  Oh, it's nothing special  Oh, end of a century, oh It's nothing special
