Here's how it goes.  "Hi! How are you? Good. Can I see your tickets please? Okay now passports or birth certificates. Alright, now credit card and credit card form. Are you both going to be using this exact credit card the whole time? Okay now can I have your immagration papers? I'm going to need you to sign right here. Great. I'm going to need to take your picture. Okay, now here are your key cards to get on and off the ship, into your room and they are also what you'll use to buy things from gift shop or if you wanted a massage. Your dinner reservations will be at blah blah if that's a problem you can talk to the matridee on the ship. This is your map, and this is a welcome note from Holland America that has basic information that you'll need to know! Have a great trip." And that's the basics, if they have kids it's more difficult and they always have questions, but it's not too hard once you get the hang of it. The hard part is standing up for so long on the concrete floors. My feet and back hurt, but hey. It's a good job and I'm glad I have it. I feel bad for Em though cuz I don't know everything so I'm always asking her questions.   On sunday it's a little easier becuz you don't have to take their picture. OMG! On the way to work on sunday, the exit we take was closed and we had no idea where to go, we were so lost! We spent about 45 minutes driving around seattle! We ran stop lights, illegal U-turned, stopped on the freeway to backed up, sped of course, and a bunch of other crap. I thought it was funny and when Emily said "Hey, that's where work is, and here's where we are I just cracked up. I was crying I was laughing so hard. She didn't think it was as funny, but i couldn't help it. Eventually we got to work. Did you know Seattle has a China town? I didn't until we drove through it.   I've got 5 days off, then another two days of work.  ~Bayz
