I wish I could fortell the future, plan it out in a notebook and have it all come out right for once. Nothing is ever perfect, and again I'm left standing here facing a new focus ahead as I have always faced it, as a single, strong, steady woman. I think this time I'm ready, I am ready to start my life, to grow up and experiance all that I can, to see the world, and live every minute to it's fullest. So while the sunset is bittersweet, the sunrise is even more beautiful and exciting than ever before.
