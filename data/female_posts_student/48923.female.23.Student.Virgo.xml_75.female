(note to self for later, i should take a picture instead of using amazon's picture.)  not only is this bundt pan not made out of metal, but it is flexible and flaming red.  i must repeat: flexible and flaming red!!!  seriously what more could you want in bakeware? this is quitpossiblyly the silliest kitchen item i own.  more silly than my milk frother, and better humored than my beautiful blue glass cups. (i currently have a theory that everything tastes better out of thcobaltlt blue cups. i like looking a the blue-tinted world thru the bottom of my glass.)  the bundt pan imesmerisingng like silly putty. it bends, twists, springs back to shape, and you can bake cakes in it.   and the whole thing is made out of silicone, which adds another dimension of silliness?  (arsiliconon breast implants as bendable and can be used for cake baking?)  i'm easily amused by kitchen gadgets.
