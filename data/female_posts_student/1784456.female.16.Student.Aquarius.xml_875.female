Oh god, I'm gonna be stuck all weekend going - "I want the third one!" Katie - Get the fourth one in Bristol!!! They're so good and easy to read, you could just sit in the shop and read a whole one in one go and you'd be done before they could notice! Awww I wish I could come tomorrow but I'm at orchestra, and I've got loads of catching up to do from being ill. Newshop guy phoned and asked if I could do a round on saturday mornings - ("Yes! Thankyou orchestra!") Ahhh I'm in demand. Speaking of orchestra - sorry, but - HOLY SHIP! I have an ASSESSMENT (I don't think I can even spell asses...assess...ases...a-asess...(ah heck) -  the word  . argh) tomorrow!!! Smellllllllll..... AND I've gotta get going on my music coursework - first composition has to be in by December 18th. Oh it's cool - me and Laura and Beki and Jen (and everyone) at school orch get to dress up as vampires for another one of Mr.Kelly's overly-eccentric school productions *cringes at memories of Piratemania. Eugh.* Is it me or is everything about music right now? Heheh, English was so funny. I had to take a role infront of the class and be questionned by everyone. You could have fried an egg on my face.
