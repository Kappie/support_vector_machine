I guess I should start trying to find something to wear.  ...Soon... Soon....  Ok, on to the topic of the my least-liked person. Corbin. Bah.. Just when I thought he had given up on me... He yells out to me that he wrote a song about me and begins shouting out some lyrics... Bah... I can't stand that boy. You think after being continually rejected since February(?), he'd get the idea...   (Some) boys are so dumb.
