Your appointment is at 3:15."  Since when did I have a dentist appointment today?  I walk in, and Johnette the receptionist gives me her simpering smile, pressing the buzzer to signal the drones they call hygienists.  But, surprise of surprises, mine wasn't a drone today.  This woman made  interesting  conversation. She and her husband moved down from Vermont 6 months ago apparently.  She talked about college, and where I want to go, and where Ellen and Mary go.  She went to the University of Vermont I think she said.  She talked about how conservative everyone around here is, and how she misses it in Vermont because everyone curses more up there.  She accidentally snagged my lip with the pointy thing, and after apologizing, asked if I wanted my lip pierced.  I said no, but I had thoughts of an eyebrow ring.  "Oh, I bet your mom would love that.  When I got my tattoo, there was a guy who was getting his eyebrow pierced.  He fainted."  Then she talked about the tattoo on her back.  "Yeah, I'm afraid if I wear something strapless everyone can see it.  Like, everyone saw it at my wedding.  But after a few drinks, I didn't care much."  Wow, did she just say that? The regular dentist wasn't there today, so some other guy (he was a dentist too, I just don't remember his name) examined me at the end.  He and the hygienist were talking about vegetables as he worked on my mouth. "Yeah, I like my tomatoes with salt.  My sister used to put sugar on hers." "Ewwww, I would hate that.  I like cucumbers with salt though." It was the randomest thing ever.  Really quite amusing.  They were almost flirting with each other -- and over vegetables.  I promise that I am not making this up. At the end, my mom came and paid for everything.  Johnette worked her magic with the computer and informed me that my next appointment is on the afternoon of Wednesday October 27th.  That was by far the most interesting dentist appointment I've ever had.  I think they will get much better somehow. By that time, I was really hungry.  So after half an hour, I forced some pretzels and a bottle of water down.  And that pretty much brings us up to now.  I think I'll go take a shower.  I feel icky.
