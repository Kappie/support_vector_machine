It's a pity that every time I get close enough to consider a friend a life long close friend, my little bubble of optimism pop as I begin to regain my sight of a person. It seems like I have semi-clear judgment of a person at first impression then I start turning a blind eye on all their deficiencies as a person. When I start trusting the person completely, all my expectations collapse as the person's dependability is laughable. It's rather pitiful how my social life is. No wonder I come off as aloof when people first meet me. I guess my multiple failures in finding THE best friend left some scars.  Oh well, I guess the overused quote "if you want to do something right, do it your self" does have its merits...  Although I didn't want to do what I have to do in the first place.
