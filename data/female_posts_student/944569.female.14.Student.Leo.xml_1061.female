It's a tribute to Nirvana and the fact that I'm now a teenager (YAY!!), and I don't care if it's too long (ahem, hem Dana).  It's jenny_smellslike_teenspirit@hotmail.com, add me if i haven't added you yet!!  I think I'm gonna listen to smells like Nirvana again. Oh, and Nikki here's a hint:  try and get on like the fourth row and get in the middle of the row and you'll get less wet.  Oooh Hardest button to button just came on the radio!!  Are me and Dana the only people here that listen to 102.1?? Anyways...  I guess you can all guess that I'm extremely bored at moment...
