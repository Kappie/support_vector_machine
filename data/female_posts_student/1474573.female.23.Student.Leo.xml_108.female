EXT- THE OLD HOUSE- NORMAN 16 YEARS OLD-(THE MORNING AFTER)  “A son’s a poor substitute for a lover”, Mother empty space should have taken my place  He can’t fuck you like I did he tried he tried  I fucked you over like he did It only took one time one time  I could love some other but “A boy’s best friend Is his mother”    II.  INT. – THE PARLOR- (NIGHT)   I WON’T LET YOU HAVE HER! I can’t  be in two places At once wombs won’t act concentric like circles two women  can’t  run the same kitchen  someone’s bound to get swallowed  someone’s bound  to get squashed  If you see the porch light on Don’t come She’s sweet She’s good She’s  done nothing wrong  III.   INT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)   “Come into my parlor” said the spider to the fly  “I’d love to have you for dinner”  You can have room  number one  The one with the peephole Come undone  You have that something most girls don’t have That thing that puts a man ease  12 rooms 12 vacancies  And I have the lowest prices plenty of closets to store your vices  Check other places  if you must but don’t I have a smile that you can trust?    [diane]
