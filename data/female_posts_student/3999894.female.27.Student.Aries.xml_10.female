My name is Stella Creasy and I am a councillor for Lea Bridge Ward in Waltham Forest in London.I'm not very technologically advanced so I hope those of you reading this will bear with me as I try to get to grips with blogging - it is my hope thatthis blog can be a forum about Lea Bridge Ward in Waltham Forest and a point of information, discussion and dialogue for past, present and future residents about the changes they would like to see happen in their local community. We've got an exciting time ahead of us in Lea Bridge because a lot of investment is coming to the area- to give just one example over the coming two years Â£400,000 will be invested in improving public services in Lea Bridge through the Government's Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. Local residents will have to decide how that money is spent and what priorities we as the local authority should focus on and I hope this blog can help inform that process. I will also try to keep readers updated on our progress on tackling other issues around Lea Bridge too and perhaps also give you an insight into what I do as your local councillor and give people from outside the Walthamstow area an idea of what Lea Bridge is like! I'd be very interested to hear from anyone who reads this what they think of the blog and any suggestions for what information I should post.
