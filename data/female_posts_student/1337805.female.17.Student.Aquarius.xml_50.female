And he's really funny, and adorable, and I've known him forever...He's going to be in some of my classes next year, and he's in my TA. So I see a fair amount of him, and he's in my youth group. I like him. And one of my friends today asked him if he liked her, saying she liked him. She knows how I feels, and he says, Yeah, I do like you.   Ouch. That hurts.  Nothing I'm not used to though, just a major step backwards.  A propane truck ran into a telephone poll today. Could have been nearly killed, nothing major. Made me realize how much we depend on technology. My house was without barbeque, or any source of hot food. For lunch, I had ham, crackers, peanut butter and instant pudding. For supper, cold beans out of a can, dry cereal and instant pudding. Looking at that, having to find new ways to entertain myself besides the computer and tv, and microwave, I had to read. And I tinkered around with my discman (Seems that beating it to the ground didn't fix it), and played Pokemon on my ancheint gameboy. It was fun.   Was at a dinner party thing last night. Spent a fun tiem doing my hair, and looked really smart. Almost everyone there thought I was going into university or college. At church earlier that morning, a few more. And throuout the course of the year. I'm frightened..I was told I looked and acted and dressed younger than I am, but yet people think I'm a college kid. Does that mean, if I tried to look smart that I would be in my late twenties?!  My camera works again. Apperntly there are like, 2 differennt kinds of USB ports on my computer: One 1.1 and one 2.0. That's great, cause it's a webcam too, so now, not only does my camera work, but I have a webcam. Joys!
