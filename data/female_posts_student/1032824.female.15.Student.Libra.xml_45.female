Suddenly, within hours, they were both  DEAD .  The team of 6 surgeons and their 100 supporting staff had tried to stem the profuse bleeding. they failed. but we should not allow this tragic setback to douse the fire of our passion to push the frontiers of medical science or have our nerves frayed in the facing similar challenges in future. they are bound to come our way again.  What led to the deaths will be examined and analysed in weeks ahead and something positive would have been learnt, to be shared with the international medical community. the surgeons involved in this operation should be proud that they had the courage to take this calculated risk in trying to help Laden and Laleh when no others in the world wanted to. even the Germans declined to help when they were approached by the sisters in 1996.  the surgeons here knew the outcome could go either way. but more importantly,  the twins knew, too.   the worst has come to pass and this was something the Raffles Hospital team was aware it had to face.  When they were as young as eight, a family friend remembers seeing the pair trying to walk in opposite directions to break free from each other. public hopes that they would survive the surgery, which began on sunday, had taken to the sky partly because of Dr Gog and his team team's success with the Nepalese twins.   Laden and Laleh knew that the operation was highly risky, yet they wanted to go through with it in order to fulfil their hope of being separated.  they faced the challenge with  remarkable  fortitude, optimism and cheerfulness.    -  Extracted from Streats and The Straits Times  -   I was deeply saddened by the news when i was told by my mom yesterday. Laden and Laleh were such adorable common laymen.. they absolutely did not deserve this. what wrong have they done? to choose to lead separate lives? on the other hand, i hope all of us have learnt something from this. we should all appreciate and cherish the people around us. the lives we lead. the things we own. and who we are.  we are undeniably, very lucky . i would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Iranian people and the family of Laden and Laleh.   To everyone who reads this, do take care.   "Ladan and Laleh, like two butterflies have burnt in the candle of destiny, but it is the light of this candle which gives us the hope to continue the endeavour for the betterment of human life."
