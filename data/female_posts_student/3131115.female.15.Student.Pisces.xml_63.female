I have to go to my grandmas today too, so that wont be so good if somethings wrong and I have to leave.   I talked to *you* lastnight for a while..it kind of felt good, and then Bill called so I had to leave without saying goodbye. He told me that he doesnt want me talking to you, I dont really know why. Somtimes I wish I never told him, but..I feel better now. Sometimes I think about what had happened if I had stayed with you instead of going back to him..but, when it comes down to it..I guess that I dont have a life without him. If I left him, all my dreams would be destroyed. I hope that you're happy. Even though for some reason, I'd be mad...I kind of hope that you find someone else to be with so you're not lonely. Not like...nevermind. I dont know what Im talking about so I'll shutup.   I've been thinking about killing someone. Stalking someone. I had a dream lastnight that I was a stalker, and it felt so good. In my dream I was hanging out with this person..and he started to like me..and I was like "do you remember my voice?"..and he started yelling and, well..I strangled him. It felt so good too. After that in my dream, Bill and I got in an expedition and drove off..(illegaly) of coarse. The funny thing is..is the guy in my dream had Jordan's physical traits. I dont care about the rest of the dream..but I just know strangling him..whoever he really was..felt so good. But it's not just me dream..I think about it in real life too. I know that I would never ever get away with it, or ever do it for that matter..but I think about it. I've even thought about getting surgery and changing how I look and then going to see Robbie..and like, I dont know..Stabbing him in his throat. *sigh*...stopping now.  I want to go back to sleep, but I know that I wont be able to. God dammit..I should go, I dont feel so good.
