Then he called me back and wanted to know if I wanted to see The Passion of Christ with him and his scissor happy chick as well as Druck.  I said "SURE!" and then about 20 minutes later Ricky was at my house so that we could go get tickets at the Quarry.  They were sold out for the showing we wanted, so his gal pal with the scissors said she couldn't go.  So we decided to go check at Live Oak for tickets.  Well, it was sold out there as well.  So then we decided to grab something to eat and go back to his place.  We ended up staying around there, visiting with his family (his parents, Mike, Courtney, Uncle John, Kim, and Trinity) and eating dinner for his Uncle John's birthday.  We had a good dinner, and some wonderful cake which Trinity made.  ;)  Then, his uncle, Kim, and Trinity left.  We were just sitting around trying to think of something to do... and his Mom asked us to run over to Kim's to get Cream of Tartar for a cheesecake she was making.  So, we did, and we also stopped by my house to get T3:Terminator 3 so his parents could watch it, and so I could get my car.  During all of this, we decided to go see Lia, because we hadn't seen her in awhile and we wanted to meet her new boyfriend.  So, that is exactly what we did.  They were having a party because Lia had just finished her 100th  Trinitonian .  So, we got there around 11ish, and stayed til about 12:30.  Then we stopped by Krispy Kreme on Austin Hwy, and Druck ended up getting his coffee there (he needed coffee to sober up after having a few drinks at Lia's) and we all got a doughnut.  Then we went back to Ricky's for a couple minutes, and then I went home.  I fell asleep soon after, because I was tired.  :-)  It was an adventure... and I was really glad to see Ricky.  We also talked about seeing Mr. Sinus this weekend.  So, I said that'd probably work out great, and that I'd call Scuba Steve and invite him.  I dunno if he'll come, but at least I'll be inviting him to do something with me, right?  (No more cat in the mouth of a certain Austonian chick!)    What am I currently doing?  Well, I just got up from dozing off... so I have yet to start my Genetic Disorder paper, and I still have like, 2-3 loads of laundry to get done!!!  OY!  So, off I jet now!!!
