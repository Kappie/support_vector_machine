Or that there was no thirteen year olds. Or because maybe I had my con fling... That was magic. My youth group had just arrived at the site, and we were trying to find out rooms and where everyone was. We were talking about a guy, the K in my new nickname, KFC, and suddenly he appears behind us. We went to one of the rooms, to hang out, and decide that's where everyone was gonig to sleep, and everyone was talkgni about where the mattresses were going to lie. I didn't want to be bothered to try and move mine, so I said I'll sleep on the floor or something. I sat on one of the beds beside K, and started talking, slowly leaning into him because I didnt want to have to sit up straight. The bed thing came up again, and I said I didnt want to sleep on the floor anymore and K said I'll just have to sleep with him on the bed. I had no problem with that, it's fun to sleep with a guy in the same bed, and I didn't think we wold have much sleeping anyways.  Friday night reigned on, and we explored the site, got to know where everyone and everything was, touch groups (that we still got lost finding) orientation, the usual. Late for worship, was sad about that because worship is fairly important. Went back the room, started to almost snuggle with K. Just get comfortable with everyone in the room, we get called out because someone has already broken community, the rules, by smoknig pot in their room....Not too cool. Everyone gets up and goes for a walk, and we steal a lugagge cart and start pushing people around. I break away from the group with him, and we go walking around the campus. We hit were another group was, out having a stroll with a smoke, K bums a smoke (but never smokes it himself) and we talk about this guy wanting to be a unitarian. We walk off, and go find this stairwell, and sit in it. Not talking, just hudled close together, keeping each other warm, waiting for something. My heart starts to rapidly poubd in my chest, I feel like its about to explode in pieces everywhere. Finally, after what could be hours, days, months, years, he reaches over and kisses me..Softly and gentle at first, then powerful and strong, unleashing power and lust caught up for ever...
