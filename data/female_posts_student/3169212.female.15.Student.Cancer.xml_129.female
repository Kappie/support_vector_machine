But thats me...  You do that every year? You're a better man than me. Wait...a better snake...or something...  I didn't do a thing. It was Daniel. Do you think that i'd be able to reply to an Evil Snake in their own language to tell them that i'm the "Great God Oz"?  C'mon, you know me and snakes...its nothing personal.
