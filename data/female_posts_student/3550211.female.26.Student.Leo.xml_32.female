One likes to stay here and not go, it's such a good country," Karzai said in the White House Rose Garden.  Can you blame the guy? In his own country he faces the constant threat of assassination.  Unfortunately, Bush wasn't down with Karzai's idea, "jokingly telling the Afghan leader, 'Get home and get to work, will you?'"  Nice, eh.
