So congrats, Christina - even though I already delivered them personally, this is extraordinary news that wants sharing with the world, or at least with the three people who read this blog, including myself.  And if you end up going there, well then you'll just have to start your own blog and call it "Southerner from New Jersey."  Oh, and I told you so.  So this is a cautionary tale to all you non-believers out there - do not doubt the power of the word of Shannon.  Once I speak on a matter, it is all but set.
