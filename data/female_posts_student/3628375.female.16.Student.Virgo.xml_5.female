I mean not knowing when I'm going to see him, or what hes doing and how much trouble he's getting into, is so nerve racking...I love him so incredibly much and I just want things to be totally happy and easy for us. I just want all this bad shit to be put behind us, and I really want to him to stop getting into trouble. I dont know how much more I can take. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him, I just want it to be easier. I just want to be able to see him when I want to see him and for us to do things like a normal couple and have fun. I pray to God that things turn around and we get through all this shit and never go back to it. I love John, so much and nothing will change how much I love him.  I gots to fly...laters!!!!!! Love ya'll!!!!!  ***Things will get better, sooner or later***
