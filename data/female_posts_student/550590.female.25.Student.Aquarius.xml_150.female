Surprisingly, she and Frank seem to be doing okay, but she scared the shit out of Zoe, who now cries every time anyone goes near the bathroom.   Today really begins the unpacking, as I need to get my room empty before I can put my bed together and actually start living in my house.   At some point this week I'll be overhauling my entire site. Stay tune for bigger and better things to follow!  ~D~
