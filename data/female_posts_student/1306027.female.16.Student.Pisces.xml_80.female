(unless, he's a pervert, in which case....nevermind.) Today's episode:    Mind over Bra   Now, I am sure that you are wondering why the heck I would be talking about bra's in a blog entry. Well, it goes like this;   Today, I was out shopping for prom crap. I already have my dress, the shoes, and the purse. But, as my mom so keenly pointed out, I needed a strapless bra.  Just thinking about regular bras makes me cringe. You see, I am a tomboyish kinda girl and I don't do the whole... wire.. and.. pads.. thing. I tend to stick to sports bras because, well, they are comfortable and... they are comfortable. Don't get me wrong, I own regular bras and all. I just don't wear them all that often.   So today I was out shopping...  And I come across a nice looking strapless. I take it to the dressing room (which, was surrounded by guys) and try it out.  After battling with the hooks to try to get it to close, I took a look-see in the mirror. It was like:   OMG! I have boobs!  Something that I must have completely missed out on having before. I didn't like it. So I changed back into normal clothes and went to find my mom. She says:  It's only one night, I'm sure you won't die.  Gee thanks mom, so reassuring.   So I bought the "strapless slingshot"  Was I happy about this?? No! Of course not! But I had to have it for my prom dress. (erg)    Ahem, so anyways.  I went shopping today, and here is what I bought:  1. A new bandana 2. A new shirt (old navy...) 3. New flops. (sandals..) 4. Some makeup  And that's all I have to post for the day. Ciao.    I leave you with this......old navy rocks!
