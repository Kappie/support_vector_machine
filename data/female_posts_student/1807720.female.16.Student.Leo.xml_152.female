In Drama we had a sub, and Bio I don't even remember what we did, I think it might have been the quiz that we did yesterday, and a lab.  Yeah I think that's it.  Then for active living we went off-campus and went bowling and I learned how to score keep for 10 pin.  It was actually not that hard and I am improving since last time we went, because I usually only do five pin, so 10 pin seems really odd.  Then Swain asked if I wanted to do volunteer hours for the leadership aspect of active living, and at first I didn't really want to, but then I said I would do it because I thought "might as well get it over with."  So I helped with admissions at the door from 4:15 PM - about 8:00 PM.  I actually never knew bball games could be that interesting to watch.  Then I went home and watched the most boring episode of Survivor ever and finished my Bio homework.  Today is going pretty good so far.  I am addicted to the Y.M.C.A.'s low fat muffins and their brown toast.  The food is sooooo good.  I also had the salad in which I have wanted to eat all week - my old classic Friday lunch - The Chicken BLT.  Yummmm.  Then when I got home I cleaned my room cause I was in the mood and well everyone else went to the movies, but my dad is in town for the weekend so I wanted to stay home.  Plus I didn't want to see that movie anyway.
