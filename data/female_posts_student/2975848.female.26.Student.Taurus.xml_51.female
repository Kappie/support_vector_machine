Then I close my eyes, And try to find, the Special Star. The Star, that shines so bright, And guides me through life, Giving me the strength, To, survive, the new coming day.  That very Special Star, You don’t find it in the sky. It’s in your heart,  Lightning your way, and Warming your soul.  My Special Shining Star, A dear friend gave it to me. I gave him a star too. Just hope, he would able, to find it, in his heart, as well.  [To someone special]
