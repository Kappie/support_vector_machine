I can't write too much though...i stopped by one of these "Cyber Cafes". haha i thought it was funny that they're called that. well it's a whole other world over here. Everything is revolves around living life, eating, food, music, and colors! I love it! and i'm living like a queen cuz there are servants and we have our own personal cook! But i must go..there is much to do! I will write more later when i have more time  I miss home! haha jenna is the only one reading this probably..so this one's for you jenna! I miss yoU!! You can talk to me about all the stupid stuff you want when i get back!  MUCH LOVE FROM THE LAND OF BROWN! A Part of the majority..no longer a minority. hahaha.
