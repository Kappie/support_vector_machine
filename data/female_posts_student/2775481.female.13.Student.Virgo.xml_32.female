Yesterday was any normal day boredness as usual .. i help my cousin rearrange her room and then went home and had american chop ten went on the computer to talk to people.. then my mom called me and asked if i wanted to walk wiht her cause she didn't wann awalk alone and she didn't want to take my dog so i said ok and we went. You know have you ever got the feeling that some1 wanted something but didn;t tell you well i think my mom wanted to know something i had no idea what but thats ok.. anyway so we walked and came back home talking about random stuff and yea then i went on the computer and did my hair and went to bed the plain all usual stuff here. As you can see my life is boring and i usuall dont stay up with these things but i'll try i guess...
