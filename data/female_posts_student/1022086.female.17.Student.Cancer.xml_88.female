Except for at night, when the hot isn't oh-so-bloody-hot anymore and feels nice instead.   Nonetheless, I like rain.  I'm rather glad it rained today.    I'm always hungry, and I cannot walk a straight line.  I feel relieved because the AP Chemistry exam is over. Pass or fail, it's over. I am such a happy camper! It was a hard test, indeed, and one of the two lab questions was totally written by a crackhead (read: I bombed one of the lab questions), but overall, I didn't feel unbelievably terrible about the whole deal *KNOCK ON WOOD*. I was really nervous initially as everything that could have gone wrong the day before and the morning of the test did, in fact, go wrong, but once I started actually taking the darned thing, apathy kicked in--that was extremely helpful in getting through it all right.    Choir concert was decent. Extremely disorganized, but fun as always. Got to see Justin. Yay for Justin! Got to see Laura and Sierra and Jonathan, too, and that was also "yay!"  I cannot wait for school to finally end (save for the fact that I only have a week to bring my Crackulus grade up!!!) I really sincerely cannot wait to get out of here, although there's a possibility that I might not be able to go to Genova after all due to mom's odd fears... I'm really happy to simply be leaving the country, but I really wanted to go to Genova for various reasons...  First of all, I haven't been there in five years, and that is a long time. Secondly, I miss it. Thirdly, I really want to see people. Fourthly but absolutely not leastly, I want to go back to my old church...   I really want coffee. Is anyone up for a profound conversation over coffee?  (Call me anytime)   I'm always hungry, and I c-a-n-n-o-t walk a straight line.     "No Poetry" by Gary Jules   "There's no poetry between us," Said the paper to the pen Something's burning in the attic That her tongue will not defend Through the arc of conversation Past the teeth behind the smile Down the miracle mile To the bottom of the ladder Paint your eyes and hide the tatters What's the matter, baby? Could we go downtown To the middle of the world? You were always such a pretty girl And you told me I was beautiful "There's no poetry between us," Said the paper to the pen, "And I get nothing for my trouble But the ink beneath my skin" If your clothes are getting weary And your soul's gone out of style Blame the miracle mile And the bottom of the ladder Paint your eyes and hide the tatters What's the matter baby?  I'm coming too
