I just finished my own personal Dawson's Creek marathon (thank you, Kazaa!) and I downloaded some stuff from the Internet, like the new Liz Phair CD (thank you, Kat!), and I'm being a bitch and avoiding a friend who I promised I'd go out with tonight. I just didn't feel like it! I know, I know, horrible me, but I have a hard time saying no to friends who wanna go out when I don't. Whatever. I'll send her an e-mail. Um, I think I'm going to Ithaca tomorrow with M...biking or hiking, not sure. To go biking, we'd have to take two cars, and I think that's a bit ridiculous. But hiking, hiking may not be exactly what he had in mind. Whatever. I think I'm gonna write my friend a very apologetic e-mail about how I fell asleep and just woke up (wink wink) and really hit the hay. G'night!
