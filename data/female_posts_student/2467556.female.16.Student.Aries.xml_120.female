I really got to talk to them and i never really had before, it was fun to see them one last time.  There are no juniors in my my mentor class, so us sophomores get to play Seniors for 2 years, tight isn't it?  ok so since Katie has to tell Michael Buckley EVERYTHING, she had to tell him about how we saw Adam Havens shirtless at sand volleyball or that one time at Brittnee's party that we went to his house "accidently" to make him sing happy birthday to her.  So apparently, today, Michael told Adam Havens that I, Taylor Mercer, stalk him because i went to his house (which i did that with 10 other girls!!!) and that i went to go see him at sand volleyball with Lindsay when i honestly had NO IDEA that he was going to be there.  Katie failed to mention these facts to Michael and therefore Adam thinks i stalk him.  Oh joy.  But he did ask if i was hott, lol.  Brittnee and Katie don't think that Michael really told Adam anything and that Michael made this whole freaking thing up just to scare us and me.  I don't even know Michael much less talk to him!!!!!  AAAAAGGGHHH!!!!  I hate him soooo much, he spreads rumours about people to other people and he doesn't even know what the hell he's talking about!!!!  grrr, he needs to get off my hockey team.  blah blah blah.....nothing else really happened today....  stewie - are we getting everyone together on friday night or saturday night?  we need to plan that ASAP!  AND we need to figure out who's house: yours or mine?  alright i'm going to watch my new Miracle dvd now...  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
