Secondly, I dunno...things have been odd lately, rather odd indeed. It's like communicating with people has become, well, daunting. I'm not sure if that's the word I'm searching for, butfor nowit seems fitting. Everyone seems so "bleh", and I hate it. I wishI could do something to remedy everyone, but I guess that's quite impossible for any human. All I can do is offer a listening ear and a bit of advice, but that's only if you ask for it (the advice part). I guess my feelings have been mixed...a lovely blend of joy and melancholy, much like a yogurt of emotional sorts. Missing people is never fun, it just seems as if several of the people I care for so much is far away from me, whether the distance be measured in miles or in mindset. I hope that makes sense. Tonight I feel like playing with words a little, maybe not in a poetic sense but, rather getting away from my droning "Veronica-ish" tones.   As of late I've felt like listening to music, walking outside in white linen dress, and just taking photos of friends, having a picnic,maybe reading a book under a tree, and just sitting under the stars talking about life with the oneI love. The idea of simplicity really is appealing to me in such a complicated timeframe. My desire conflicts with reality, it seems. Everything in reality is just so...well, I'm sure you know the word I'm looking for. I'm not saying everything is bad, but I have a feeling that maybe a few of you know what I'm getting at.     ***    On a very random note, I had a dream last night that a fluffy white cat with a smushed face latched itself onto my head.Ithink I was wearing a late 50s-early 60s style dress walking from a school or a college. In the dream it wasn't too fun, but waking up and thinking of it was quite funny.      ***
