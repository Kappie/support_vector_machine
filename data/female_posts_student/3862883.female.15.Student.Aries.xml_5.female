I think he is influenced by Kurtz, there is some change in his mind. After listening to Kurtz, Capt. Willardstartes to understand Kurtz's mind, then he judges him and decides to kill him.Willard is sick of the Vietnam war, he is tired of killing people.   Kurtz is insane. The enviroment has changed his thought, he lost his ability to judgewhat is right and what is wrong. We can see there are corpses everywhere in the movie, and Kurtz is like a KING in that area. Poeple in that kind of place seems to go mad easily, Kurtz was born in a civilize enviroment. After fighting the war, his mind is totally different, he started toact like a barbarian, he started to develope his own kingdom.
