I really need to invest in a universal remote so only I can control the volume, CD, or station played. There is nothing worse than the karaoke induced migrane. I have nothing against karaoke--I have been known to scald a few eardrums myself after a shot(or six..) Someone needs to tell some of these people that they suck. If I do something, and I suck, I count on people to let me know. And usually they do.(you do right?) These people singing tonight have evil friends, i think. I can picture it around the water cooler:    "hey guys, karaoke night is tonight, be there, cuz I am goin ta do carly simon!" says Mr. self-thought singing sensation.    And when he walks away:    "Is he for real?"    "Yeah, its hysterical. we buy him drinks and watch his embarrass himself in front of who ever sticks around to hear it, then we take photos and paste them at work! ( maniacal laughter )"  Either that or people are just delusional, and have been told they suck several times and still can't accept it.   There are people that are truly meant to sing, and waste their breath singing at karaoke night. These are the people that you stop tuning out, the ones that are so good you can't stop listening. None tonight however, ..not that im an expert...  So what is new with you??  If you want to start your own journal, or share pictures online easier than email attachments... ( initials VS! lol )email me and let me know. its pretty easy to do free.  till next time, incognito
