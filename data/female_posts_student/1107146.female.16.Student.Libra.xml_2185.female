Abby, sorry I couldn't come to any of the shows.  Trust me, I would have much rather been there than where I was.  Firday actually wasn't too bad, I went to lock in, but I got no sleep.  I was actually planning on coming that night, but mommy made me go buy my grandmother (KY one that you met) a birthday present.  Then on Saturday, we went to my grandmother's house for her birthday and we didn't get back until 10:30 last night.  And then today I had to write this whole research paper about Vietnam and my mommy is going on a cruise so I had to see her off.  I would come tomorrow if you had one.  That would be a perfect time!  But you don't... :(  I'll come to the next one though, ok?  I'm sure yall did great even without me there.  Everybody vote for me on Thursday!  I probably won't be back on here before then.  Things are sooo busy!!!
