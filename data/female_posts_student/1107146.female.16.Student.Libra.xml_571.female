It's on the table.  Linds, if you read this again, remind me to ask you about something in English tomorrow. If you remember. I've been trying to and consequently, forgetting. So if you do, that would be awesome. It's not dire, by the way.  And even if you don't read this, maybe I'll remember making this post, and will thusly remember?!? Probly not.  I like the "?!?" thing at the end of sentences. It's really goofy.  Also. I have two songs stuck in my head that suck being there. There's  Miss Independent  by Kelly Clarkson. Which is bad but not as bad as the other one. The other...it makes me feel like a slut.  I Wanna Be Bad  by Willa Ford, or someone like that. It's a really slutty song. And everytime I think of it, I feel like a total whore. Go look up the lyrics if you'd care to divulge my pain. They'll probly be on some porn site somewhere.  Irrelevently yours.
