All of which I've TOLD ALL OF YOU ABOUT BEFORE. Goddamn, you people are complete morons not to have known this before. The too flirty thing is a new one though. I never really thought it was bad until I got chewed out for it the other day (not gonna say by who). I'm just a terrible person. Period. A while ago I told some people that I wanted to change myself to be nicer, but they all replied something along the lines of "No, accept yourself for who you are, learn to love yourself, etc. etc." But, this week, Ginny said "Grow up and stop bitching." Not only does that contradict what she had already said, but I'd have to say she does the same. I really don't enjoy talking to her anymore, because all she says to me is that I have some type of personality fault or that she's incredibly in love with this guy from Canada. Neither of those are very entertaining. They're not even occupying. I've also noticed that I've become incredibly antisocial as of late. I don't really talk to anyone that much. Not even Monica, and we ALWAYS have something to talk about. If I'm on the phone for longer than 20 minutes, I can guarantee that it's because the other person is talking alot *coughryancough*. When I talk to people over IM, there's often long (long being over ten minutes) pauses. When I'm around people in person, again, there's a lot of silence. I have to be around at least two people to be able to converse at a moderate level. But whatever. I think I'm done for now.   Current Mood:  Turned Away
