Like using ponchos or trash bag suits!  I think I would enjoy cubing more if I got less dirty.  Are we having another study group tomorrow?  A serious one at someone's house, because the park doesn't work.  I am not even going to mention it to my parents yet or at all for that matter, so consider my house off limits.  Sorry.  By the way, I am making  a list of things we can do when we get together.  Just put anything you can think of that is free/cheap, fun, and close to put on the list.  Once it is complete I will share and things should be more fun.   The spoon beckons , au revoir!
