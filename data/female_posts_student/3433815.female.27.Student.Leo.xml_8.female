I had been in a cold dark place for so long, hiding from the sun and what the world could offer me. Thank you for letting me go and allowing me to see that there is a bigger and better world out there for me.   urlLink Bitter  - I can't wait!! are you free this saturday? We can start then, since I'm going out already for H's b-day.  I haven't felt this good in a LONG time! Love. I have so much to give to someone deserving. I can't wait. :)
