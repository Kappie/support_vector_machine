As for the dissertation related goals. My strategies for overcoming the obstacles are:  - Allocate specific time slots for dissertation related writing, reading and discussion for each day  - In the allocated time slots, every time I experience an urge to do something else, pinch my arm. Write down a check for each success of controling it, write down a cross for each failure as well as a sentence that people I care might say if I could not finish my dissertation in 4.5 years and find a good job.   - At the end of each hour of dissertation-related work, if I've done a good job, treat myself with a nice 10 minutes break, and write down a sentence that others might say when I finish my dissertation and find a great consulting job.   - At 8:30pm, if I haven't reached my goals, do 30 push ups or run for 20 minutes for each hour missed. If I have finished everything by that time, I could do whatever I want in the evening.  - At the end of the week, award $10 of "fun money" (hobby courses, clothes, fun stuff) for each dissertation-related goals reached, and a social outing if all goals have been reached. Otherwise, I can't go out before compensating the missed hours.
