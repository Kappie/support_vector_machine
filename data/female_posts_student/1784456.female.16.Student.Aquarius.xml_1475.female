I'm gonna give them a book of poetry... let's not say anything more, you don't want to hear about my scary poetry! Eugh... what are you supposed to write for a 25th wedding anniversary? 25 years of emotions... Swimming in a botemless pitt.. Erm... I think I've confused me now! (I will rule the world!) If someone offered the world to you, would you take it? Someone was saying that they would, and would make it democratic, by having a representative from each country, but then you wouldn't have been elected so surely that's pointless. It would still be a dictatorship. I wouldn't! Simply because I don't want to corrupt myself or others. Yeeaaay, a morbid conversation! Woohooo! *morbid sounds cool*
