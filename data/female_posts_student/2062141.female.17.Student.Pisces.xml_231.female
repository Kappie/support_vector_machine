Gr... *beats people up* My mom got me a big burrito     :)         but it was 10pm     :|      and now I'm all full of big burrito at 10       >:O      but that's okay! This was one of those days that started and nearly ended really horrible but then ended on a good note. Dontcha just love it when life screws you over and then is like, "JUST KIDDING!"  Wow I sounded really smart just then. .... uh.... To the SATS!
