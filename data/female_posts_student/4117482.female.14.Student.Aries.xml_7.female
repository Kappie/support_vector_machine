He said we'd discussed it, well we had, but a good few weeks ago. Right now my brother and dad have had a major fall-out. Basically my dad's being a prick. Anyway, he got kinda angry at me. I went back to sleep. Woke up later and got me some brekky, then when i was on msn, my best friend Amy told me she broke up with her boyfriend, well being the best friend i could be. I ran to the co and got some chocolate and sprite:) The best thing to get over a break up. We decided to go into glasgow, for some impulse shopping...and a bite to eat! I had a really good day. I haven't been hangin about with Amy recently. Although this probably sounds very immature, she is kinda neglecting me, I'm not saying that the fact we're drifting apart is her fault. Just I feel that her and my other friend Lyndsey have got so pally. So i've been hangin about with some different people, and they're totally awesome. Sarah, Nicole, Roz and myself are just becoming so close. You know that feeling where you can pretty much share anything with someone, I have that with all of them. They listen too :) ...this emo angel is sounding too happy. Okay, Lyndsey just said that tonight her, Amy and Kirsteen went jogging round the loch. After I spent the whole fucking day with her, she doesn't even mention it to me. I even phoned her to invited her to the cinema , and her mum said she was out jogging, :( I feel really used. This blog is becoming somewhat of a bitching parlour. Where I express...how much I hate everyone. Okay, let me change the tone. People I love... Chris! Where to start.... well Benfolds.org, that's where I met Chris, we clicked (having lots in common including music and the fact we live in scotland). Chris lives in Oban, and i've met him once. We had "something" going on at one point, but it got called off (by chris) ;) but i'll love him forever, we're soul mates! Paul is my current boyfriend, he's really sweet. God knows why he went for me, he's too good for me. Tonight all the gang went to the cinema ('The Gang' being Paul, Stuart, Nicole and Sarah) we saw 'King Arthur', I didn't watch much of it, too busy talking to stuart about films, music, and being vegetarian. We have a lot in common, except our music taste is different. Today was pretty awesome. For the rest of the night I'm basically gonna listen to music and mess about. Have an nice night.
