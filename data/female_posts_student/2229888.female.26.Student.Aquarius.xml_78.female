It spilled from his pockets like a fountain leaving a slug-like trail of green from bar to bar for the rest of that night.  It was his last night of freedom, and I figured he should enjoy it while he could.  Meanwhile, I went home, stripped (no pun intended), and stood under a hot shower. I sighed as body glitter, mascara, and the stiff goddess Aerosol, slid down my body, over my toes, and followed a whirlpool into oblivion.  I was finally rid of my cape and tights and could slick back my forehead curl, slip on my horned rimmed glasses and sleep.  The next morning, I prepared the apartment for a visitor. When everything was in place, I called in "sick", and readied myself for the coming night.  I chose a soft pink gown that was oriental in style, and covered everything from neck to ankles. It also clung to my curves with every move and was slit to the hip on either side.  I wore little make-up, taking care not to cover my freckles, and I pulled my hair into a bun held tight with sparkling chopsticks.  I took a look in the mirror to see a girl-next-door all dressed up for a night on the town smiling at me. Perfect!  I pulled open the mirror, reaching to the cabinet behind to grab a plastic amber-colored bottle of Black Magic, complete with a child-proof cap.  I dropped it into my purse, applied some lip gloss and waited for the doorman to buzz me.  "There's a gentleman by the name of..."  I interrupted him with the push of a button. I didn't want to know his name.  "I'll be right down, Henry."  I came through the elevator doors to see Joe Normal standing nervously in a cheap suit, a bouquet of yellow carnations hanging by his side.  He looked up at me expectantly, then looked over my shoulder. I winked when his gaze came back to me, and he looked surprised.  He hadn't recognized me, which was the point and I was pleased.  "These are for you." He squeaked, holding the flowers before him.  I fingered the bottle, beneath the fabric of my purse, ignored the flowers, and offered him my arm.  This was going to be too easy.
