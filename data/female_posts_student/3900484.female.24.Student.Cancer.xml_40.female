I don't normally get to have those, so tonight was a welcome change. I went out with my manager from work, Megan, to see  urlLink this  movie, and have a drink. We just went to a restraunt bar since it was kinda early. I had a good relaxing time. Except I went by a store on the way to the movie, and this guy outside was trying to talk to me. Why do strange people I don't know think I want to strike up a conversation with them? Or get hit on at a grocery store. Let me tell ya, that's really classy. If we dated and then had kids later in life, I could tell them how dad met mom at the local supermarket. And not even inside, he was sitting outside. Fabulous. The movie was fairly ok, I thought. I liked the romancy part of it, which is unusual. Well, unusual since stupid head. I haven't been much into romance lately. But Im getting better. Anyway, I think Mr. Phoenix is my type. He's a very solid person. I like people who seem very real. Ok, so Omaha. I spent Thursday night hanging out in my room watching videos. That ordering video thing in hotels is really cool. And expensive. Watch out for the cost of the movies you rent/watch. I had planned on maybe going out somewhere, but lost the nerve. I bummed around town the first day, and gave the prof. I was meeting with a call. I met him this morning, which was nice. I got to meet a couple of grad students, and the marmosets. I felt a little like I was being quiet, which I have a tendency to be around new people, which is bad since it may have made me seem uninterested. I am very interested. Im just not sure if I want to do behavioral endocrinology for the next five years or so. Gotta work that one out. Plus I didn't really have anything to eat all morning. So I wasn't feeling my hottest. But I still had a good time and I'm going to mail a thank you card to thank him for taking time out to meet with me. I stopped in this small town on the way home for lunch, and ooh it was scary. Beware small towns with only 3 fast food restraunts. I think everyone in town was out at the Arbys today. So Im sorta boring but I had a good time. I need more mini-breaks from Kansas. Plus the town was a lot bigger than mine. We don't have any 5 lane highways here, like they did there. I think I like bigger cities.
