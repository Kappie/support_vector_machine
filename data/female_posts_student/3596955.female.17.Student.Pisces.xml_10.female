Lately, I've had the curse of unexpectedly waking up during the sound, uncanny night. It hasn't dawned upon me until now, that I may be suffering from fatigue. And the consequences it has inflicted upon me! My oh my. A loss of appetite  persisting lethargic effects. *Sigh* I just simply want to kick into my old routine. None of this two hour deep sleeps.  Nicole  Nell are leaving tomorrow =( I'm merely saddened by the thought of not witnessing the flourishing of these beautiful girls! But I know that God will continue to protect His children  bless them eternally. So with that thought placed peacefully in my mind, I am happy that they will too be happy, healthy  safe.  Hume let me borrow the   'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'    novel which is rather intriguing. The context as a whole is somewhat satirical. But you have got to love them! Hahaha the peculiar concept of tzussing in particular, is worth a read! I have most certainly accomplished two weeks worth of high school education in just one day - today! It's getting tough. Real tough.  One down Eight to go!  Oh. To my surprise someone unexpected called me today! Oh boy I missed them.  Oh! gah! that boy. Is so queer! You know what Im talking about bus bay babe ;) hahahaha omg! To even think..opps *unspoken forest*..haha  By the way, I extend my appreciation  gratitude to those individuals who insist on perusing such drivel..that's raetarded for you  =) hehehe. You know who you are! Haha!  -- feeling *gah* --
