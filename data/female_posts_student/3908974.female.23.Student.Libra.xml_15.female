My bed is like a nest--Twisted patchouli smelling blankets and books and papers and cracker crumbs and crayons...I clean it all the time, but I always end up sleeping narrowly on one side of the bed, hemmed in by a heap of random trash.  Somehow a stick pin got in the mix, so my legs and feet are cut to hell.  It gave me a weird dream:  A repetitive reel of a dream where I was getting up, talking to my roommate, getting dressed, going to campus to get tickets for the latest lecturer (Bill Clinton).... Then something bizarre would happen, and I would know it was a dream and that I needed to wake up, and it would start all over again.  At one point, my stomach was hanging open and I was trying to hold it shut with Band Aids.  And then I was in the woods with a highwayman who looked like Robert Smith from The Cure and we were having a nice time in the leaves, but then we had to find the Holy Grail...  Walked to school this morning listening to The Boss.  Big fat drops of rain were starting to dot the ground and the wind was making my ponytail flap around my head.  School's over but none of the work is.  I have to study and read and write...I have a feeling I am going to be spending some quality time alone with my imac.  I wish I cared about school more these days, but I don't.  I just want it to be over.  I want to lay in the grass and look at the sky.  I want to sleep and sleep until I am not tired any more.  I want to listen to rock and roll and drive around in my truck.  I want to take my man fishing and listen to the bugs sing.  Went out for beers last night with my roommate.  It'd been a long time since both of us have committed the sin of neglecting girlfriends in favor of other things.  I forget sometimes what a good girl she is, and how much fun it is just to talk.  I think we're going to be long time friends.  But there is a strange dynamic with her and my boyfriend, which kind of eats at me sometimes.  They're really good friends, and I wouldn't touch that, but one of them is lying to me, and I don't even want to know which one.  Who doesn't tell a white one now and again?  I'm as guilty as the next person, but it stinks being in the middle of it, hearing two versions of the same stories, sometimes even on the same night.  I'll just keep my mouth shut until it becomes relevent to my life.  It has crossed my mind that their hearts may be tied up in each other more than anybody knows.  Strange it doesn't bother me.  My man is really good to me.  Even if his heart is occupied by others, I think it's safe for me to believe that I am growing on him.  He's growing on me, for sure.  Neither of us are virgins.  There are the ever present ghosts.  Who cares?  There's still room for living ones.  So anyway, I won $200, not $250, but I got second place and I suppose that's something to be happy about.  The girl that took home the grand prize is absolutely amazing.  She's going to be famous one day, probably soon.  I think I will be too, but I have a lot farther to go.  My dad called last night, which was nice.  Sometimes I feel like he reaches for things to be proud of because I've fucked up so much.  I really have.  I should be at some prestigious graduate school right now, but I'm stuck in the mud in Kansas, in debt up to my ears and covered in scars.  Still paying for my past, I am.  Got a present in the mail from an old friend.  A fine bottle of whiskey with a commemorative tin cup.  (He knows what I like!)  I've known him since I was 15 and we used to be so tight.  He was a big nerd.  Wore black shoes and a rancid brown coat with duct tape on the sleeves.  Always smelled bad, always had thumbprints on his glasses.  I was slightly cooler than he was, mostly because I was cleaner and I had a reputation for being gay, which people thought was exotic.  The first time I saw him, I knew he was going to be my friend always.  Sure enough.  We don't talk much anymore, but when we do, we get down to it.  He's my Emergency Husband.  If we turn 37 and are yet unmarried, we're getting hitched.  I love him to death, but I really hope it doesn't come to that.  Christ, I've written a novel.
