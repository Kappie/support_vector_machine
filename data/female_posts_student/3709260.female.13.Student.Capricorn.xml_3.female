(ohhh god did i love that!!!!!!) but then, back stage, Toto was there! and he came out and we finally met face-to-face. well... here is the weird part... the concert was over, and then mike had came over to me, and kissed me.... (OK OK THAT WAS REALLY GREAT!!!)  and he told me that he liked me... im just standing there...like..okay i feel u know, kinda...faint...but anyway.. Toto came back and Mike told Toto everything, and next, Toto asked me to be his GF! i said: HELL YEAH!!!!!!!! and then... everything worked out... but the weird part was when mike kissed me and told me that he liked me, and then he went and told toto. but that was my dream... man did i love it.... lol.. well about to put up some of my poems.. hope ya like them!! byes....
