I killed absoulutely everything in sight and sometimes that might not have been such a good thing...Poor orlo, he was outside and I was weed eating near him and he got grass in his face! He now thinks i'm crazer than ever...Thank God for orlo though! He has been the only thing that has kept me sane/occupied while paul has been gone. Oh hey today is my 3 week anniversary! I spent it weed-eating and watching tv! Fun! But Paul comes back tomorrow! So that makes me REALLY excited! Ha ha...Radiohead rocks, it can drown out a weed eater and I have been listening to Pablo Honey all morning so I think my brain is a bit fried...the bordom is about l.......l this close....
