It's about this girl who was given the gift of obedience and whenever a person commands her to do something, she [yes and obviously, you might have guessed it] does it. Her mom dies so her father remarries a [yes, you've guessed it] rather evil step mom. The step mom has twogirls, who are part of the Prince Charmont fan club. The older one realises that Ella does what she's told andstarts bullying Ella. Ella, now desperate to find the fairy who bestowed her with this gift, sets off on a journey. Along the way, she meets ogres, elves and giants. PrinceCharmont [who accompanies her, along with an elf]falls in love with her and is influenced by her thinking. So, he wants to the welfare of the non-humans when he gets the throne. They meet danger and blah blah blah...manages to live happily ever after.  Rating: 3 [outta 5]  Review: This movie was okay in the sense that althoughthe plot is sort of clich√©d, a lot of lil' funny things managed to keep it alive. Anne Hathaway was very convincing in the portrayal of Ella who's ordered around.  Reflections: If the movie was set in this period of time, and someone would've ordered Ella to "go fuck yourself", what would it look like? And how is someone gonna fuck him/herself?
