Then i woke up and worked on a vcd of all the photos from my vacation.  it came out pretty good cept i was only using a trial version so im trying to get the real version and thats getting anoying.  Then me and merry went out to celebrate her getting her license.  we went to applebees then to target to get mitra a get well present.  then we went and visited mitra. im glad shes feeling better.  at mitras i found out i didn't have soccer.  that made me happy.  i went to aau practice and got to see everyone who i hadn't seen in a few weeks so that was cool.  We had a meeting about bermuda which we leave in 4 days!!! YAY!!! Then we just shot around for a little while and then came home.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a good day also which would be todday I guess since its passed 12.
