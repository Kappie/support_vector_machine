He's just getting the outer part of the pin that held his leg together after it was mysteriously broken completely and very cleanly. That happened at the same time that half of his nose disappeared from his face... My poor cat is such a freak...  ..Anyway, I didn't expect the surgery to nearly as bad as his other ones.. I don't think it is.  Mom said that our vet's dog got hit, and he said that they were working on his dog and that it would take longer for them to get to Snuffy and that we'd probably get him back by Monday. Well, It's Wednesday, and there isn't a Snuffy whining to sit on my lap... I really miss him.  It's been too quiet.
