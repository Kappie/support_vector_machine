Of course, it's had more than it's share of shitty, shitty moments.    Feeling sick today.  After a long long meeting with advisor #2, I found myself with a terrific headache (and it was a good meeting), which did not go away and led to yucky nausea.  So I couldn't eat, and still can't, even though I have to eat as I need sustenance.  I wish Matt was here to take care of me.  I've pretty much been laying around for the past 5 hours.  And still don't feel much better.  Will be an early night, that's for sure...  But in happy news, Santiago called me tonight.  Yay!  And B-rat is back from vacation which means more people to talk to online. : )  I love my friends.
