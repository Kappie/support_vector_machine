Or simply select a few to make others fear Do I really need this burning sword? Or is this the true battle  Held on ethereal plains of faith where I waited for so long for you I love you for what you are A distant star blinded by the unseen And I will always remember how you were Before this contention of disposition Know that I've always loved you For what you are and for who you've become Something I've always wanted to be Something unique.
