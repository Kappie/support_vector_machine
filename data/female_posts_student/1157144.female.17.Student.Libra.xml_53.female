(except for chris *trauma trauma*) ....but really, that is over the top... she has no evidence, and god knows what her kid *really* saw.... it's life, it's full of penises.... i guess that's something we all have to learn to live with. now if like, i saw jason's penis, i think i would  definitely  take that one to court, but really, she is exaggerating way too much... i mean hiv? that's crazy.... maybe she is just a lesbian and highly bitter. i don't know. you always seem to meet very funny, odd, and silly people. lucky you, huh?  i say she's the bitch that  really  gets the "tar and feathering".... mwa ha ha...
