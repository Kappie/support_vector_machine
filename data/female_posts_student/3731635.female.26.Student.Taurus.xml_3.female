Even though I am enjoying my walks alot, and really am starting to look forward to them, I just am hung up on the aspect of physically losing weight when I like how I look now. Losing weight for my health requires some substantial looking ahead on my part, and even though I am uncomfortable now, and in pain physically, it still seems like that isn't enough to make me want to lose weight. I am still looking at the idea of doing what I have to do, regardless of whether I want to or not, which is soooo foreign to me. But I will keep chipping away at it and taking it day by day.
