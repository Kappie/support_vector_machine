Give the old dungeon some breathing room you dumb hoe... oh yeahAND...wash the shit. What kind of fucking nimrod gets7 yeast infections... hey if it itches and it isnt going away, and you keep gettingit... how about you stop letting the blackstudents in your classdo your gynecology exams you cheap fat bitch and realize that maybe the itching is from fucking that bald red assed baboon lookingflea bag of a boyfriend or maybe its from the fungusyour unruly pubic hair is sustaining which hastaken overthe lower half of your body...
