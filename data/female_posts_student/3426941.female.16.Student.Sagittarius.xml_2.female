I'm extremelly jealouse of the people I know who do not have to be at school today, namely any senior at Desmet. If you are reading this Ryan/Billy/Bob, know that I envy you with my soul.  On a good note, I am excited to be able to leave at twelve thirty after my bio exam. I'll probly take it easy and sleep. Sleep is good, though so is Bread Co.  Well, back to the diagram of a schematic animal cell...
