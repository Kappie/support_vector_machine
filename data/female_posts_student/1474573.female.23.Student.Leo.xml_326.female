That said, when a person comes to you for help, listens intently, then leaves you because they are seemingly 'ready' to 'do what they gotta do', and then a few hours later goes right back to the same bullshit is infuriating.  You ever feel like you're wasting your time?  Wasting your breath?  Y'know...I'm feeling a little bit of the "why do I bother?" right now... It sucks.  I... I'm just really f'in tired.
