Maybe it's the Brit's soothing voice; maybe it's the lack of annoying commercials that refuse to shut up; maybe I'm just conditioned to FM radio.  Whatever the explanation, I've consistently been sleeping through the insightful, probing news stories and these have been increasing in length and significance.  At first, it was just a few minutes out of my breakfast-TV time; then, it was hurrying through Morning Pages a bit; this morning, I managed to get myself on Tuesday's clock.  Tuesday-time is half an hour later than Wednesday-time.    I thought I was only 11 minutes behind when I rolled out of bed at 7:11.  And when I got in the shower at 7:37, I was seemingly right on time.  True, there was something a bit off all morning.  Just seemed to not be entirely on top of things, or at least not as much as I would like...but I attributed it to the mocha I had after 5 last night and my less than filling dinner of leftovers.  Nothing a good dose of water and vitamins wouldn't fix.  But, when I finally glanced at my watch before heading out the door, I was slammed back into Wednesday-time: 8:06.  Class began at 8.  Yay.    During the drive to school, I considered not going to class at all.  But I didn't spend more than a good chunk of my early and late evening reading 20+ pages of material just to not have the lecture to go along with it.  And so, I went into class, 20 minutes late, head held low and avoiding eye contact.    But I needn't have worried:  they had done student evaluations during the first 20 minutes of class and the rest of the time was spent discussing the functions and form of the Statute of Frauds, and not the material I read so diligently last night.  So basically, I got to sleep in, albeit unknowingly, took notes that don't need to be typed up and have no reading for Property to do over the weekend.  Student evaluations rock.
