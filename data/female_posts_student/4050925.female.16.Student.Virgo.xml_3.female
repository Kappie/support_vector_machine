PW, LEP etc. i'm competing wif time to meet datelines. somehow i am so helpless. never got myself in such a mess before. i came home and sleep for two and a half hours..hai~ but i'm not any better. i think i'll have to stay up late tonight..AGAIN..i think one reason i'm sick is due to the lack of slp. the heat's building up in my body..that's why. i'll end here...no energy liaox...bye
