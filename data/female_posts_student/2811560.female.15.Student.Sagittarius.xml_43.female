She called 20 times at 10:30 to wake me up. Seriously, she would call, and when I didn't answer, she would hang up and call again. And she did this over and over again. I eventually answered, hung up on her and unplugged my phone. So I'm in for it when I get home. Looking back, it would have been really smart to just pick up the phone and leave it there so it rang busy. Oh well. So anyways, I decided to go for a bike ride today and I ended up at the forest preserve in roselle. It was probably around 2.5/3 miles there and back. It was fun I guess. I ran into Emily, her sister and her mom. Weird. Yeah. She said she would call me about going to the barn tonight. She hasn't called yet so whatever. So how about those Oscars? All I can say is that its about damn time Lord of the Rings got recognized. Yay! I was happy. Anyways, I'm super excited for this week. I get to do my solo at the chorus concert and then anything goes starts Thursday. I am so excited for that. Chris said he might be able to come see it. That would be cool, I guess.
