At least, I look I'm of legal drinking age.   I did the Erotic Poetry Slam thing at Berkeley, CA, Feb. 13. Anyway, I think I scored low because I was doing blatant self-promotion. I'm trying to raise funds for my new self-published book DEAR OPRAH. I'm going to do a DEAR OPRAH Book Campaign Tour. Its mission is two-fold: 1)Get me published--alas! and 2)Raise money so I can fly to Chicago and meet Oprah. Any volunteers? I need donations, promotional materials, webdominatrixes--uh, I mean, webmasters/mistresses. Would anyone be interested?
