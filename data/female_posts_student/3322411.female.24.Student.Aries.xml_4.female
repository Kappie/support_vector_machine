It really breaks my heart to hear about stories like this, when two helpless victims were unjustifiably murdered. I was extremely content to hear that this law, which now makes it a crime to harm a fetus during an attack on a pregnant woman, was passed. However, I feel that this law should been enacted prior to the Peterson murder. I think that the murderer should be punished to the full extent of the law. What gives a person the right to murder either the unborn child, who has not caused any harm to anybody? Giving life to another human is one of the greatest miracles, and harm to a pregnant woman can cause her to lose the baby. An individual has to truly be deranged and heartless if they kill an unborn baby with no justification, while causing harm to his or her mother.  This bill, however, only applies during commission of federal crimes, such as terrorist attacks or drug-related shootings, and only when it is being committed against the pregnant mother. Not to knock this bill, but it isn't like we have terrorist attacks on a normal basis, and I do not believe that a pregnant woman would endanger the life of her baby by hanging out with drug addicts or dealers, whatever the case may be. Of course, these shootings can be accidental and the mother may be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Any individual that is responsible for inflicting harm, whether it is intentional or not, should be held accountable for their actions and definitely face the penalty for causing harm to the fetus. If a mother were to get into a car accident and her baby were to die, that person responsible should be held accountable for the baby's death. I'm glad that pregnant women will not be the only victim if something were to happen to their baby. As for Scott Peterson, I really hope he is found guilty.....We'll find out soon enough!!!
