I got into Anatomy, but what's worse, people who I thought should get in didn't, and people who I really didn't like got in. Erum's in it, and so are Nigel and Tiffany Chang. And that's really sad--those are the only three people who I think I'd get along with well. It's petty, but I'm really not in the mood for another "how are ya?" conversation right now. Nimo didn't make it in. Neither did Wendy. I'm sorry, but that's just lame. And I start to think, should I have counted myself as lucky to have made it in when two of the smartest people in the junior class didn't get in? But then again, what kind of luck is being just as lucky as BM?   I don't like her. (Forgive me, I do think I am drama queen today.) To someone in the hall: "Hello, darling." What the heck is that? That's like being called "pun'kin" by the lady at the checkout line at Ralphs, but coming from B. (Involuntary shudder.) She copies homework, is flagrantly dishonest. Is a priss. Doesn't stay on task in Freeman. Maybe is bi. Annoying as hell. When I think of her in terms of a noise, it's it's a fake laugh. And H too. Didn't Bowman say she wasn't going to let her in because she was off task? I don't like her either. Nor do I appreaciate M.   Hah. You must be reading this and thinking I'm some dysfunctional character. Maybe I am. I'm laughing at myself: I don't get along very well with other people. Even worse, I have no qualms about it.  But otherwise, today was all right. Keira made me a bday cake in journalism and we all sang, which was so nice of her. Jean and Amanda wished me happy birthday. So many people are going away for break: J's going to Spain, P to England, Ireland and Wales, K to France. Actually, it wasn't bad. I'm just tired. And I hope I go shopping with Tiff tomorrow, but you never know.  Spring break outlook: a birthday won't make it so bad. A's coming along to the party too. She was asking me in history when my birthday was...and it kind of felt weird not asking her along since she came with us when we celebrated Enid's. I smile already, it's going to be so much fun. So many good people. Aaaaah, maybe I'm just attributing too much importance to this one day. But it's going to be a good time, I can just feel it.  May 1 is going to be hell: SATII times 3, Bach regionals, and now an AA car wash.
