Sorry I haven't wrote what happened in the winter break yet but I will do that on my next blog ^^:  Anyways, I have been doing well these last few weeks~ But, I have been feeling sickly (is that even a word ?!) Well I have this feeling due to this stupid ugly guy > Today was good~ But one bad thing is that in my computer animation class I feel off my chair > The good thing about today is that I made a cake (ChOcOlAtE!) It is very good ^o^  Lately I have been finding my self baking so much~ ^^: Jyan calls me a house wife -o- Well atleast the guy I marry will be happy...  I finally bought a skirt ~ And yes, it's pink XD Just like my shoes that I bough ~ Pink!  Well gotta do my homework :'(  See ya ~  - alei ^^  (song) *Oh My Girl, Oh My God!* by: T.M.
