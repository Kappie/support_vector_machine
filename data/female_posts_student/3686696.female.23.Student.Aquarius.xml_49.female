I think you look better with the longer hair though.  You could probably fix yourself up so you'd look fairly decent with some work.   why do you have low self esteem? beauty is in the confidence that oozes out of you.  Its tough to say in those pictures.  the head and shoulder sizes are fine.  The chin is little squarely for a girl.  The elbow area tells me you are not overweight and will not be. The edge of the nose could be sharper.  The neck could be longer and less fleshy.  Face size and eyes and others are proportionate.  Teeth are fine. Small chests.  Short hair makes you look like a boy.  the lips could be thicker but that's my preference.  Can't see the back or the waist or the ankles or the wrists: all very important aspects of femine body. I wouldn't say you are beautiful or pretty in traditional sense.  You are cute and it is in your smile that you can charm others.  Your narrow glasses make your eyes look smaller.  Try some other type or contacs.  ...you look cute enough to me :)   I have a fair sence of beauty. I'm sure like most women you aren't giving yourself enough credit. just because you're 15 pounds over weight doesn't mean that men won't throw themselves at your feet.   ur not pretty. you look like a boy..try changing your style, putting on some makeup, and letting your hair grow out. sorry hun  Not a model, but hen who is.  You have a very nice smile and warm eyes.   I thought I was going to have to make something up or be really diplomatic but you are someone who would totally catch my eye if we passed eachother by on the street.  what size breasts do you have?  you look like a smaller B  I'm a lesbian and this may sound stupid...but I think lot of girls would hit on you with the shorter hair...most likely because they think you swung their way if you know what I mean ;)   From what I see you look to be a natural beauty with genuine character. That dazzling smile doesn't hurt either Miss.  You have a huge smile.  Not just with  your mouth but with your eyes  anyway ..  you seem like a nice person.  I don't want to be stereotypical in either respect, but on Asian women, either looks good. I mean its the absolute BLACK color of your hair that is astounding. It is the shine and way that light reflects off of it....  Shorter looks better, but in either case I think you'd benefit from a nice, expensive cut. Just walk in to a real good salon and tell 'em to do what's right.  Finally, t-shirts are for guys. Dress up, and don't be afraid of your curves. Embrace them, and soon enough guys will want to embrace them.
