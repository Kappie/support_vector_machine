(well, maybe not big, but it'd be hard to find her. i want everyone to know that the gap (not of rohan) is walking distance, as is the beach. i'v gone there once and the waves arent big enough to surf on but perfect for snorkeling. i plan on doing both (surfing on another beach). everybody, the four feathers is out on video (hint bethany/kelly/all of u: go get it!!!!). actually, that wasnt a hint. correction. (order bethany/kelly/all of u: go get it!!!!). there we go.
