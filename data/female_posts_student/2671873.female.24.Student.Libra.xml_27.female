Now I live with my friend Francie, his girlfriend Paula and another friend Grace in a beautiful new house.  I am working a shitty bar job that pays shitty and has messed up my sleeping habits but its money.  I think I am going to look for a part time day job so I can reduce my hours at the Strand Bar.  I have met a few randoms working at the bar but that always seems to happen.  Other than that I'm just hanging out for the summer then only God knows what's in store.  I am anxious to find out.  For those of you who read this shoot me an email or something.  I am getting home/friend sick.  And want updates.
