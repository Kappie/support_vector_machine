HI SAM!!  my mums gone to the AFL tonight with some ppl from her work, greg is out making a living being a pizza boy and m left to wallow in my misery watching What not to Wear, whilst complaining to an inanimate object. Bonjour mon ordinateur! i just got a message on the screen that you have the trojan horse virus, Lucky You! i really dont give a fuck if this dear contraption infront of me is sick, im not giving it a hot water bottle and cough sirop, it can suffer in silence! HAHAHAHA, IM SOOOO EEEVIL!!! until next time,  love me.
