The chem teacher was nice again today.  She even like reviewed this stuff that we are doing on the board with me and Thy and like when she was talking about it in class it all make sense because she had explained it to us already.  I think the quiz went really good.  There was one question that I got a little confused by but I did my best to figure it out and I think I will at least get part marks.  I am soooo sick and tired of failing her quizzes and I KNOW that there is no way that I failed this one.  I knew alot, and I know the stuff so yeah I think it went good.  I thought that math teacher was being kind of rude today though.  I mean sometimes she helped me but like I got this sort of vibe from her that like she didn't want to help me cause I think she thought I could figure it out of my own.  I tried tonight though and I am very confused!  I couldn't even finish the assignment cause I got lost on how to do that stuff and it is on the quiz tommorow.  In the morning I might be able to see if I can find an available math teacher and maybe they can help me.  Ususally my math teacher is really nice though, but today she was just kind of "off."
