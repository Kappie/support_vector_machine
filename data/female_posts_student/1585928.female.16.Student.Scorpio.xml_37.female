"did i go to the wrong website?" haha well the answer to that is no! i'm bloggin for brittany today because she is a blog failure and is too lazy to type a couple paragraphs.. so for lack of better things to do.. and as vbf.. i am writing her blog. well this was her weekend.. starting with saturday! she woke up at 9:30, got dressed, and went to the mall with dana..they shopped like all day (without me) and went to lunch.. bought a lot of goodies! then she met up with me and we went to nick's... theres was like 7 people there and we played 'know it all'..this includes brad, who was trippin everyone out.. he thought kate spade was a bball coach.. and whenever he was wrong, he kinda -to himself- said "ShAT" ..lol.. okay so then me, brittany, and gracie went and met the alleged REX...... who was not exactly what we had in mind.. needless to say he scared brittany to death when he begged me to leave her alone with him... then we came up with an incredibly desperate plan. we lied. we told him a friend of ours was stranded at walmart and we had to go get her and take her to her home in utica..and would not be coming back from clinton.. reality of the situation: gracie was in my car.. stayed with us for like 2 more hours, until we took her home, to lakeridge. after all that though, we went and got Mex, JP, and Boo (brenton didnt go because he was sick). we went riding around and then to brett's (boo's) parents' house to play pool and watch madd tv and pretty woman..we had fun! it was great! okay well then we went on home! sunday, since i hadn't gone to the mall this weekend, i made brit go with me to northpark, where we saw Cary, Josh, and Matt. Josh and Matt left and we made Cary walk around with us for a couple hours.. we shopped till i was sick of spending my own money.. so we went to old navy and then took cary home just down the road... alright, so we went to krystals to buy some food haha.. and josh called brit.. josh as in josh wilkinson.. they talked a while.. i chatted with him too.. well then brit went home.. that brings us to monday!.. boring school.. gay homework.. i came over.. we played out of order for countless hours.. and then i left.. brittany talked on the phone and online for some more countless hours and then that brings us to tuesday! which is today! which means........ a long hard day at school (and a lovely algebra 2 test).., chosing class rings, and a crappy lunch. well that brings us to now. we're sittin at brit's.... eating animal crackers! hahah!!!! anyways! i guess i'll end this blog now.. so thanks for readin!......... GeT'eR DoNe!!!
