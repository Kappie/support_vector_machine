I've seen her probably less then an hour since she has got back from her trip (which was Sunday) and I try not to think about it, but it's so hard when she keeps on bugging me!! I just don't know what to do. The worst part is it reminds me just how much I miss my mom and I go to bed crying. Is it really that bad? Well, depends from your point of view, some stuff just really annoys me. It has to be her way. It can't be done a diferent way because it has to be done her way, because she is so smart and her way is the best. It's so frustrating, it really is. I just want to do something to really make her... I dunno, show her how I feel. I know, I'm a christian, I shouldn't hate her, but its hard, it really is. Now I have a question, for anybody to answer. Say I've just started my life career and my dad passes away. Do i stay in contact with her? Do I really want to. I mean, she has done many nice things, but it's what the average mom should do. Just all the bad times come back. Do I call her once a month? Or like Christman and Thanksgiving? Fred himself doesn't even talk to her, just my dad. I think the Fire of hate for her still burns. And as for Sarah, I never think they will bee on even terms. I really hope none of you guys have to, or ever have to go through what I have had to go through. I mean, at 8 years old until now is pretty hard to deal with, the older it gets the easier it is.   Anywho, enough with the depresion, I just like to get feelings outta my head. Nobody really is posting much. People busy with summer and exams I guess. Today kinda sucked. Work was a repeat of yesterday, and then I just played hockey and have sat home here. But anywho, going to the beach tomorrow, YAY!   Don't forget to Answer the question! It really is one I've asked myself...for along time, input would kinda be nice, espesialy with the great wisdom from  ANDREW .(Hope You Caught That). Yay beach!!!!!!!
