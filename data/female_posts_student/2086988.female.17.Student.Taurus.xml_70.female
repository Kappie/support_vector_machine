Because yesterday I had been upset all day about what Arlo had said and then I had a little fight with my parents, so I was pretty down and yet, when I got on the phone instead of talking about how I really felt, I was freaking hyper, happy go-lucky, bouncing off the walls, cracking jokes, etc. Why do I hide how I feel? I mean I can easily type it out, or even tell in person, but on the phone it's different, it's like I really can't be myself. I can't show if I'm upset about something and that really bothers me. I should be able to open up, but it is hard to me too. Then when I can't and I sit there in silence, waiting for the courage just to say it, they have to go, and it annoys me because I need to talk, yet I can't get it out. I guess I shouldn't expect them to actually read my mind, and they'd never know, since I never show any other emotions except being hyper. And sometimes it's not even a matter of being upset, sometimes I want to express how I really feel like I do in texts and I can't. It's hard for me to seriously be emotional.  And I can't blame anyone except me. I don't know what to do...  On a happier note, I had a really good dream last night, a dream I've been waiting to have for like a month and I had it. All the feelings, making out, etc. But it still didn't make me feel any better, like it does a little, but not as much as it should.   When I was fallin' down You would pick me up
