True the both of them are happy but now instead of having only my brother treating me like shit my former friend acts like she is so much better than I am. She use to call me every day and hang out every weekend and now neither my brother or she even give me the time of day. even my brothers friends would talk to me about how much they hate her and her best friend, especially my ex he hates her and her best friend (the best friend he nicknamed horse face, and constantly called her nasty) anyway if I could go back in time I would have never got my former friend and my brother together. It ruined my friendship and it ruined what little relationship I had with my family
