But conversation is still kinda slow because he has to think about what I mean sometimes, and I have to stop using idioms. But it was really good. Turns out that he writes songs (and plays guitar, but I already knew that). He even wrote one in English which he sent to me. I liked it. And he's writing a book. Which I can only imagine is going to be long and interesting, that is, if I could understand Spanish well enough to read it.  But it was so cool talking to him. I haven't had any news from anyone in Costa Rica. It was so exciting!
