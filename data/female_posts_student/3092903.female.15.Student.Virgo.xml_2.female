They've grown up since last summer, which is really good because Emily was so hyper and required so much attention. I still have to chase her 45 mintues out of every hour to keep her entertained, but better than nonstop for 6 hours. She jumped on my neck today and while we were watching Barney all the sudden I felt these pains down my spine and i got this awful headache. Its times like that when I wonder if I can take 3 days a week...I stayed at practice until 10 tonight. We finally got all that nasty blocking done. Its always a pain in the ass, but i love it when the show finally comes together in the last two weeks. I love that good stress you feel when it comes down to the wire.
