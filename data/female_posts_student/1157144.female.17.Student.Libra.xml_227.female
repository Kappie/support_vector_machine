Then she fiddled with her blade for 20 min and said she couldn't find the glass so she called in other doctors.  I thought I would never be able to walk again cause I'd have glass in my foot for my whole life.  But, while the docs were coming, I looked at my foot.  SHE HAD CUT UP THE WRONG SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GRR  So, in went another 2 inch needle and 10 minutes later out came the damn glass shard.  Thankfully, she was a swimmer in high school, otherwise I would have turned the damn blade on her fuckin foot.  You know, I talked ot Jessie on the phone twice today... both times she sounded positively jovial... I think she's just trying to avoid homework..... :)
