I encourage everyone to post a comment answering this question - but to truly think about it before you make a post. Never before have I given this question true thought outside of the interviewer's 5 minutes of anxiety. So, I ask you...  Where will you be in 10 years?   I personally see myself working in a major record label company as the marketing and public relations manager for maybe 3 or 4 bands. Juggling lots of travel and invitations to posh parties. I see myself living a relatively conservative professional life, making good money and buying a quaint lake property somewhere in Austin. I see myself vacationing internationally for 3 or 4 weeks during the summer and spending my Christmas' somewhere ultra cold.  I see lots of charity work, a busy calendar and a personal assistant to die for.   **Pray for our service men in Iraq. Another soldier lost his life to those low-life monsters.**
