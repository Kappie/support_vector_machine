She headed deeper and deeper into the floor until she could feel her feet touch the hay barrels that layed under her. Slowly she kneeled on them ever so carefully not to make a noise. Finally, Elphaba, was under the floor boards. She could only see little specks of light through the holes. Peering up in one she could see the little girl. Fools she thought. Her plan had worked perfeclty. One of the Winkie guards handed the girl her broomstick. Elphaba unaware of what was going on stretched her ear to the hole. "Oh, thank you so much!   Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead," the girl cried. Elphaba wanted to laugh at the girl's foolishness. They all left in a matter of moments. Elphaba waited. Alls she could do was wait. She looked around the room. Barrels of hay, cobwebs, and the moist air surrouned her. She was tired from the chasing and the plotting and slowly drifted off into a deep sleep.  Her eyes opened and saw a man of straw peering down at her. She raised herself with her her elbows and held at her hand. The Scarecrow raised her up out of a small trap door that she had slipped through. "Are they all gone?", Elphaba said brushing the hay and dust of her black outfit.  "Yes, the girl is back home. Glinda helped her-", the Scarecrow started.  "All good, but what about the shoes?"  "Well, the shoes," the Scarecrow said, "I think Glinda took. She also took your bottle of elixer. Don't ask me why."  Elphaba stared out a window onto the dark mountains. Her teeth grinding against one another. Her face started to turn black due to the color of red from her anger and the green from her skin. She looked back down onto the trap door and picked up her hat. She brushed it off and placed it tight on her head. "Where is my broom?" Elphaba said.  The Scarecrow ran out of the room and came back with her broom. He handed it to her with shaking hands. Elphaba yanked it from his slowness, mounted it, and leaped out the window into the foggy sky. The Scarecrow rushed towards the window and looked out. Elphaba was hovering in the air.  "I will be back soon. I told you I want my shoes and now with that brat out of the way I can get them. I am heading back to the Emerald City to speak with Glinda.", Elphaba roared, "Don't worry I will find a way to turn you back to yourself. Goodbye Fiyero, my love."  And with that she blew him a kiss and raced into the sky dissapering into a black cloud.
