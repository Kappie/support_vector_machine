Most of them have come out or else I've outed them but there are still a few that linger, what I think, who I see, what I do... and the worst part is those secrets are not a result of me wanting them to be unknown but other people involved who for one reason or another don't want things to be known... confused yet?  I just needed to bitch?  Anyone else?
