Speaking of, what is with my obsession for watching other people play video games? Does anyone else think that's weird? I love just laying there watching my best friend, both of them actually, play whatever new video game he has. It's kinda fun. *SIGH* Talk about lame. Oh, well. I just chalk it up to time well spent!  Sorry for the lack of posts; I am busy trying to finish up my summer classes. I did, however, find a job, so I am no longer useless. AND, my friends are coming back to town so LIFE IS GRAND!!!
