I actually felt sorry for a few of the people cuz everyone was booing at them and they were just crying and stuff... then i began to wonder..why the hell do poeple watch talk shows anyways?...it is so damn degrading liek why is it our business to watch someone's sufferings? its not like we know them or anything and like we want to help them out.. so why watch it? cuz u kno why?..we are all parasites...we take from people's sufferings feed on them make fun of them and make our selves feel better from the current life we have and in the end, we do nothing good for the people on the show..we compare our own miserable or not so miserable lives to others so we can feel so much better but in the end we are not that much better off then them. we can make fun of them and holler at them and yell but what is the point?..we are degrading someone else's lives and plus, talk shows just make society look all more messed up then it usually is. like half the things we see on the shows sound so unreal which makes u think, what the hell has our world come to. man i sit there and i would LOVE to think that there is a script behind all the 'realityness' but chances are, even if there was a script behind it, cases like the ones we see are just as real as they seem.  another thing that doesn't make sense to me is why newspapers and stuff liek that print out advice columns?  like chances our some of the stuff the people send in won't happen to us so why do we bother reading them?..meh..once again we are just feeding off someone's misery which is a real sad ting cuz i kno i do it myself...u kno wat i kno i dont' have a bad life..like some people would want to be me but:  1) they don't really know me and how i REALLY think 2) I would love to be in someone else's life myself 3) they have no idea what the hell i am going thru rite now  like my life isn't bad..i am just very udnerappreciative and sensitive. and thats wat the talk show made me realize. its kinda sad that it was MAURY POVICH that made me realize taht.  but here i am bitchin and mopping to myself how i wish i was somewhere...i wish i could realize that things happen for a reason and if not the BEST..but i don't want to accept that..i wish everything could go MY way but then, that would take the challenge out of life.. but sometimes i rather be bored with life then put up with my stupid desires..liek i jsut want to sit back sometimes and have things i would want even if did feel bored out of my mind...i KNOW i don't have a bad life...and i wanna try to appreciate things rite now but i can't cuz i am too used to things that i have and i can't imagine that they will ever dissappear cuz i take so many things for granted...and i don't wanna be one of those people who will appreciate these things when they are gone cuz then it will be too late...damn just can't wait till i graduate from the crack hole i call school...i jsut want time alone away from everyoen and thinga nd meet new poeple and have a new outlook without that stupid empty void inside of me that i kno i can fill if i tried to appreciate....ooh also talkin on the phone today..i realized something..us stupid teenagers are always trying to live the fast paced life..liek from one year to another we are COMPLETELY different .. we try new thigns that aren't good for us or we try to be 'grown up'..why?..i realized i was caught into that too..trying to be all like grown up and stuff and indulging into grown up stuff but why?...for one thing it can make u look cool and stuff like that but we ALL hafta realize...we are all still young..we shouldn't be taking life that damn seriously at this age..so screw drugs, sex, alcohol and even relationships..we're not in a rush to get married so why apply on the pressure to get a significant other when WE DON'T NEED ONE...and to explain that empty feeling everyone gets?..well its a little sign for everyone to fill that empty hole that only GOD can fill..sounds churchy...damn rite..honestly i don't think i can handle a bf rite now..damn and even if i did get one..i kno i will still feel a lil empty..its jsu so intimidating seeing everyone else 'fall in love' and just me sittin in the back ground watching..maybe i will find mr mr SOMEDAY..like i wanna kno how it feels..i just kno that i still wouldnt' feel complete...  [thankfull?]
