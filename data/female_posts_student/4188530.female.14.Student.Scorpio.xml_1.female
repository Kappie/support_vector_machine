Hmm... band was interesting and yet again I've been forgotten and now I'm going to make a flag that saids french horn and someone is going to give me a disco ball! I'll be the best damn freshman french horn player ever... Ok maybe most rememberable. Whatever. Daily rambles. Umm... Oh yeah for all the people who has been watching the Olympics two great things happened last night. One the women's swimming thing beat the world record. That was amazing although my mom and I were cracking up laughing at the line chasing after the person. Also if you saw that dude gymnasnist. Paul I think I don't know but earlier he had fallen off the mat and everyone thought it was over for him but BANG he gets the gold medal. I guess it's true never give up until the very end. This really inspired me for marching band, but I don't think I even remembered but who cares. Now I'm using what's left of my precious time to do nothing till I have to practice and do homework. At least I did most of it last night so I'm happy. Anyways nothing else happened. Other than the fact I don't want the band to switch I'm happy as it is. Well I'm a brass and I must stand up strong and... help the hobos in the tutus.
