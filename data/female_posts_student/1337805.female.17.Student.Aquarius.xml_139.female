I don't know whether James is out to get me or not, but lately it seems he only talks to me when he has bad news about Adam. Bad news being that Adam is back with Lenya, again. That hurts. A lot. Like a knife ripped through my heart. Because I honestly thought and felt he had ended it with her, and for good this time. To find out he's just ran away, back to her....Grawr.  And it nags me at the back of my head that maybe it's partially my fault. I mean, I was only joknig around last night about him and the hello kitty guy, but maybe he took it seriously, and thought I seriously wasn't interested in him anymore. Maybe that's what scared him back to Lenya.   I just want to shake him sometimes, tell him to wake up and smell the coffee. She's gonig to cheat on him again and again, and again until he finally exlodes. Grrrr...
