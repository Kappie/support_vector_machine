A friend of mine characterized "Me Against the Music" as sounding like "something out of a freaking video game," which, to me, sullies the name of video game music writers everywhere. (Then again, he also thought that when Britney whines, "I wanna get in the zoooone," she was actually saying, "I wanna get a P'Zoooone," the excellent Pizza Hut delicacy. So take his opinion for what it's worth.) Its too-slick, genetically-engineered-for-high-school-dances production does little to obscure the horrendous lyrics for which Britney actually earned a songwriter credit. B-Spurrs slings lyrical barbs like, "If you really wanna party/ send my love and get ya/ really to hit, you could die/ in a minute, I'mma take you on, I'mma take you on/ come on, yeah," and, "Take a drop and rock it!" .......... The hits just keep on coming with "Breathe on Me," another depresingly empty track that sees Britney take her whirlwind technique of aural whoring to a whole new level, and again without even a sniff of actual musical validity. The song starts off with twenty seconds of deep panting, with Spears breaking only to say, "It's so hot in here." (All this talk about the buckets of sweat the girl drips and how darn hot it is wherever she goes really makes you wonder about the kind of conditions under which she records. Does she cut vocal tracks in a freaking rainforest? Do the people at Jive think that inundating the record with sweat makes Britney sexier? None of this makes sense. Britney Spears is so stupid.)  ........ Britney's latest trainwreck was proposed as an album by an artist finding herself, getting in touch with her craft, and really showcasing everything that makes her unique and valuable. In the Zone accomplishes those goals completely; the only problem is, truly "finding" Britney Spears means realizing that there's nothing about her that's unique, valuable, or artistic. She's empty, personally bankrupt, and flat-out terrible. But if you needed a new album to tell you all that, then you obviously weren't listening at all in the first place.  GRADE: F-
