Also, he just told his mother that he wants to "not affiliate" himself with the Mormon church anymore.  And for those who do not know about Cortland's mother should know this, she is a holy terror.  Cortland has been going through some major crap and I feel it's my duty as a pal do what I am doing, sticking by his side.  In addition, he (I mean I did it for him) confessed his love for Jessica Milton, and she told him that she liked Benton...  I think that is horrible, but it makes me laugh so much.  HA HA HA, call it one of those Burnside "twisted" humor incidents.  Also, Last weekend I didn't hang out because of a Bar Mitzvah...  This week I am not hanging out with the group during lunch because I don't want to...  So what!  And for the record... I am not angry.  I am over it!  Beth, you honestly read the conversation later than everyone else did and you can ask Laura and Maggie (I have no idea about Jason), I am not angry @ them. Beth, I will make sweet love with you if you ever give me a Dr. Laura moment again, guaranteed!
