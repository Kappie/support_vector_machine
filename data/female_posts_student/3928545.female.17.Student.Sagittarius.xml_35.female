I woke up today, (yesterday, I suppose, but I haven't gone to bed yet) at 7:30 and we went to visit MSU (Michigan State University). It was fine. I didn't love it. I'm struggling with this whole college thing. I had several mini breakdowns during the long, drawn-out day (at MSU); consisting of teary eyes, nausea, feeling as though my stomach was going to sink to my feet, and one full breakdown after calling someone a "Chink" or something. I'm ignorant. I didn't know it was that bad, after all, Catherine said it...lol. Anyways, everyone laughed, mostly in disbelief, after those words left my mouth. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I started to sob in my mom's lap. I'm such a baby. It was my own fault. I felt so stupid. I guess that's what I get for growing up in a non diverse, Republican town of about 10,000. That's an excuse though. I should know better.  After MSU, we had been planning on going to Skelltones to see some bands play, but we decided against it. Instead we went to Relay for Life. I probably walked about 4 or 5 miles total. But it was just really fun talking. When we came back, after coming home for a couple minutes, I brought some blankets and Cody, Sarah, and I all watched the stars. For the first time in my life I saw not one, but two shooting stars. It was awesome! Ahh...Another embarrassing story: I was walking past a tent thing and I swear, I saw Cody's mom. So I go, "Hi Mrs. DePew!", she looks at me for a second, smiles like she doesn't know what the hell is going on, and waves slightly. As all of that is happening, Cody leans over, laughing...it wasn't his mom. It looked just like her too. I was laughing so hard, making myself cry! I guess it was just a day for tears.  I ran into an "old friend" today.He actually ran into me. It was good ole Curtis! I had a crush on him last year. Then, one day he stopped talking to me. He told me that he tried to e mail me, it came back to him. That made me a little bit happy. When he said, "bye" I swear that he looked at me and did a little eyebrow "thing", I'm sure it was all in my head though. That was it. My day. My  whole  day. Thank you, you've been a wonderful audience!
