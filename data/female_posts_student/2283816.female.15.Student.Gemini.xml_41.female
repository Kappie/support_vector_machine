"delicious, delectable edible apples"  you know, i thought i had a good life so pretty and fake on the outside but so sour and bitter and raw inside i'm tired of that, sick of it yeah i want my life to be sweet with a crunch like apples fresh picked so sick of the storebought ones where they're all lucious red and taste like shit when you bite i want to pick it pure and clean, happy feel the rush in my soul from the flavor cause it tastes sooo good no more worms in the apples for me i want to taste my life, taste it good start again, reset, be fresh mmm... can't wait for the flow thrills me so fast and doesn't leave me try someone different, try someone new believe and love God move on be new be fresh be clean be pure... taste good.   Well, whatever. It's raining outside off and on, and it's generally a bleak looking day. But my heart feels kinda good, and this is a first. I think this could very well be a turning point in my life for something far for the better. I think I might enjoy my life now...I'm ready to move on and try new things. I have a desperate need to meet more people. I need new surroundings, I've been stuck up in this house way too long.  Megan's party was great!! We really ought to have another one before school starts, just as a grand finale. Beedeebooom. [/overthemoon] Byee!!
