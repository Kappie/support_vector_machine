Like shavan for instance is always wearing pink EVERYDAY. She's totally copying me. THat drives me off the wall. If i was trying to start a new trend it would be really cool. but i'm not. I'm the orignal. and soon nobody will think of me as the person that wears pink but as somebody that goes with flow. and i so don't.     Samie
