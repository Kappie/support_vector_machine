I have such a positive outlook when I wake up each morning. I crave what the day has to offer to my being.   Breathing more deeply, have I been doing. Refreshing it is to fill myself with calming breath. I'm performing my tasks with a much greater ability.  I had a very interesting phone conversation yesterday. I was initially greeted with such an uplifting spirit. Normally, that is not the case. But yesterday was very refreshing. Were they glad to hear from me? I think so. They must have gotten laid...that solves everything :D Of course, that is almost a distant memory to me:D I wish I had someone to "make precious love" to me. Someone soft, gentle, and patient enough to take time toexperiment and share openly. Good luck, huh? :D  Off to work, I must be.  With love,  BLG
