In Grave of the Fireflies, two orphaned and homeless children set out to survive on their own in post-World War II Japan. But society offers them no help, and they soon realize they can never escape the hardships of war, or even find enough food to survive. Awarded First Prize as Best Animated Feature at the 1994 Chicago International Children's Film Festival.     My Take  :  (4 out of 5) I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie in large part because of it's difference from the happy clappy or overly dark/gothic Japanese animation. Based in 1944/1945 Japan, the story is a simple one following of an older brother watching out for his little sister while trying to survive after the death of their mother due to fire-bombing. It's realistic without being graphic, and I was left with the impression that the writers were ones who either survived World War II or bothered to talk with those who had. Thankfully, this movie is "real" in the sense that it's not out to tug at heart-strings, although the ending is rather sad. In short, it leaves one to question how people in the midst of war, who aren't combatants, try to survive. I also found it interesting how no "good guy-bad guy" mentality pops up in the movie. The Americans are only briefly mentioned, as are the Japanese soldiers, and neither are put in the light of heroic or evil.  Although not rated, I'd say with certainty that children 12 and over can sit and watch this, but that the younger set would most likely be bored silly. Note to parents: you may wish to sit and watch this with your children and discuss what was going on both in the movie, and at that moment in time in Japan.  A thoughtful movie.
