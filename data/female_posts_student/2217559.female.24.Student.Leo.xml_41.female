Norwalk is a gastrointestinal virus that is easily transmitted through normal interaction like the common cold. Pretty yucky and my friend Lisa just got it. I was hanging out with her last night so today I have been very OCD about what I touch and come in contact with. I don't want that crap.   So, today is a Greek Holiday - Name Day for St. Nikolaos. Name day celebrations are much bigger in their culture that their own birthday. Tonight there is a huge party to celebrate with greek music and plates/glasses breaking. I will take pictures. Apparently, in previous celebrations, all the plates and glasses on board have to be locked up because the greeks break everything. Hahaha. Funny, huh? I am sure it will be a fun learning experience for me. I have been learning so much about their culture and traditions. Because 60% of the ship's employees are greek, all the holidays are observed.  Tradition and Family Names are the most important things to these people. Everyone adapts to their language - me now speaking basic communication words in Greek to officers. It's respectful to address the officers in the Greek language so through trial and error I am learning quite quickly.   In addition, I am learning some French (sorry, Richard), mixed in with Spanish.  My Spanish has improved a lot because I have to use it in port so much. So that's good. Sometimes when talking to my friends on board we will be using 3 different languages - bits and pieces. It's fun and very interesting.   Tonight is formal night - AGAIN. Busy evening for me but the good thing is things are getting easier day by day. I am learning a lot - brain overload. Hehehe. It doesn't feel Christmas on board. I will be sending my mail out on Monday so look for postcards from me. Lots of luv, Shelly.
