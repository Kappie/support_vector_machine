In the dream, I come to myself from a spell and find out that the baby I was pregnant with was gone from my womb. I try to think and track it back to when I was last conscious but all I remember is being aware that I had a C-section appointment scheduled for Thursday. When I come to my senses, it is not yet Thursday but the baby's gone. I think that maybe I had an early delivery but I can't make out why I am not with my baby. Then I think that maybe I was allowed out of the hospital with the baby but fell unconscious and lost it or had it stolen though I do not remember having given birth. Then I say to myself maybe the doctors were wrong from the very beginning, maybe I had no baby inside of me, maybe it was all a pseudo-pregnancy but then I remember the ultrasound pictures and actually having seen my baby inside of me. While I am thinking these, I am wandering all over Istanbul, still dizzy-nauseous-hurting and crying hard, through crowded marketplaces and empty construction sites with streets ending up dead or stairs ending in the middle of nowhere. I am the only connection to my baby and I am almost killed, seconds from being run over by cars (countless times) and misled by strangers whom I ask for help. And finally when I make it home, it is not the home I remember. My mother, my brother and distant relatives whose faces I can't make out are there. I do not know what to say to my mother. I try to lie but I am too ruined to make up one.  At this point it was 5:30 in the morning and the alarm went off. I had to get up early today because Burak (my bf) had to drive his mother to Chicago to catch a flight and drive back to Akron before the end of the day. I got up to say bye. Then I could not sleep and thought I would mail some friends from work so that they will find mails in their boxes when they arrive in the morning only to realize (after I mailed them) that it was Sunday !! Obviously I had been turned all inside out.  Hope such dreams do not recur in the future.
