I mean, I guess there's some stuff I'm happy about. Some stuff I'm glad has changed but still...there's so much I don't want to change.   I can tell, although this year wont be as crappy as I thought, that after it's over, everything will change. At least most of the relationships I have with people. I guess not all will change but...eh. I don't know. It'll just kind of suck.   I've seriously been weighing the pros and cons of doing marching. I mean, I will be a senior, and...I guess I could try for music section leader although I really am not sure I'll get it, and of course there's Disney which would be a ton of fun, but really...I'm not sure how much I like marching really. I don't want to go to camp again, that's for sure. I mean, it probably didn't help that I was in a cabin with people I didn't really know well at all but...eh, it was just kind of annoying.   I'll end up doing it. I know I will, but still...it's, ugh. I don't want to think about it now.   So, today I learned something pretty interesting. A humorous little anecdote for you all. I think humorous anecdote is sort of redundant, but that's ok because by using redudancy, I can make my point even clearer. I learned how to say, "It is a poster," in French today. It's, "C'est une affiche." It's pronounced like, "say tuna fish." I just thought it was really funny and I started cracking up. Yeah...I'm pretty sure my odd sense of humor is not appreciated by my French class but I think my French teacher was happy she made at least one person laugh.   OK, I'm going to go talk to people now or something.
