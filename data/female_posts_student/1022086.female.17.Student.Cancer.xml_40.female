Here's one for today:   "Math Sucks" by Jimmy Buffett  If necessity is the mother of invention Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this The numbers come together in some kind of third dimension A regular algebraic bliss Let's start with something simple Like one and one ain't three And two plus two will never get you five There's fractions in my subtraction And X don't equal Y But my homework is bound to multiply  Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks)  Sometimes I think that I don't know that much-- math sucks!  I got so bored with my homework I turned on the T.V. The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth They asked the new Miss America "Hey babe, can you add up all those bucks?" She looked puzzled then just said, "Math Sucks!"  Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) You don't even have to spell it, all you have to do is yell it Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) Sometimes I think that I don't know that much--but math sucks!  Geometry, trigonometry, and if that don't tax your brain There are numbers too big to be named (too big to be named) Numerical precision is a science with a mission And I think it's gonna drive me insane  Parents fighting with their children and the Congress can't agree, Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly Management and labor keep rattling old sabers, Quacking like those Peabody ducks  Math sucks (quack quack) Math sucks (quack quack) You don't even have to spell it, all you have to do is yell it! Math sucks (math sucks) Math sucks (math sucks) Sometimes I think that I don't know that much--But math sucks!  Math sucks, math sucks, math sucks the big one Math sucks, math sucks, math sucks the big one    And yes, that does, indeed, reflect my current mood.
