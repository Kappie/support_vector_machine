Had to work again last night, shut myself in a cage by accident while taking cages out to lorry. Erm...what else?? Textiles is going good. Geology still sucks but Seward is helping me a bit more now. I had a chat with him and at least we know where the other one stands. Scottie-doo is talking to me again even though I still don't know why he wasn't in the first place. But hey, hes back at least. Erm...what else. Yea Jackie brought me some mice earlier from Woolies. I ate them. I have to work tomorrow 8.30 - 6.00. Great. Oh well. I get to see Dean haven't seen him in a while.
