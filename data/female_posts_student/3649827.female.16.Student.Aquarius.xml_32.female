Mood:  tired. of everything.  yesterday i went to see spiderman 2 with my buddies. and it was all great fun. but i didn't enjoy it as much as i should of. why? well simple. ok maybe not so simple. but i will try my best to explain. the whole of spiderman had this theme of burden and unfulfillment...unhappiness...never getting what you want. and in my selfish pity, i thought how it reminded me of someone in this demented way. *sigh* and then of course there was the whole love thing. those always leave me bitter. but don't get me wrong. it was a good movie anyway. and then it was pretty late when the movie was over. and i know i should have called my parents. but if i had then they probably would have wanted me to come straight home. and i really didn't want to before talking for at least a little while. then nadia had to drop tom off. and i don't think it takes that long to do all of this. and we got home before it was 11:30. and my dad was all pissed about. as far as i'm concerned he can be pissed. i was hoping it would blow over by the next morning, but he still appears rattled. i don't know. i think i'm actually bothered that he's bothered. probably more so b/c he's gonna be bitchy about letting me do other stuff. why doesn't he understand that these things are the only thing that keep me happy? regardless of how flawed it is. it's something. i'd rather be any where than home sometimes. most of the time. i don't like how i feel . so isolated. why must they keep me trapped. i wish i could just run away. what do they worry about? that i'll do bad things? who's to declare what's good and what's bad? what's wrong and what's right? they can't tell the differance. and i can't make them see it my way. but that's all that matters. my way. i wish they'd just leave me alone. i can take care of myself. i've been doing that all this time haven't i? everything right under there noses. and they are better off not knowing. they can't handle it. they should just let me be. or i will not be happy. and i'm not happy. and i won't be happy until .... well...i don't really know.  is there need to talk more of this. i'm a bitch. that's there's no two ways about it. and i wish things would go my way for once.  and for a while it felt like it was ok. but i guess it goes along with my theory of balance. to add good points in one aspect of my life they gotta take away some from another.   i don't know. that's what i think. but whatever.   i'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night. that is supposing that you don't sleep tonight.  it's like learning a new language, helps me catch up on my mime, if you don't bring up those lonely parts, this could be a good time. it's like learning a new language, you come here to me, we'll collect those lonely parts and set them down. you come here to me. she says brief things, her love's a pony, my love's subliminal.
