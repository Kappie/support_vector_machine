I swore they said "9am" but, alas, I bet it was 9:30.  I ask myself what should I write about. I could write about the party at A1 and being able to play with AJ's snake Percy, or I could write about another party that got completely out of hand - one that I left early.   Taking the latter, I feel that personal responsibility has died. I'm not referring to an single individual, but rather all of us. Every single person could stand up and say, "stop it" or "guys, you need to chill". But oh no, personal responsibility is no more. No one can take a stand and do what they need to, me included. I look back at the five years, and I wonder what would have been different if I had maintained my position, morals, whatever you want to call it. I could rattle on about this, but you know me, and there is no need to open up the old mistakes of another era. But what we do need to do is to take a stand when we fail, and take responsibility for our mistakes. On the greater scale, just look at our national leadership. There are alot of folks there that should answer for their errors, but they don't. Oh well.   I have seen some miraculous things in the past. I have seen two acquaintances in high school bear a child, take responsibility for their actions, and they now have successful lives, and the child is fine. I have seen people admit to academic dishonesty, and I have seen folks not admit to it, which resulted in punishment, and near expulsion of the entire class. That sucked.    All I say about this is that to be a good person, should we take personal responsibilty? I say yes. When we don't we not only hurt ourselves but others around us, and sometimes even those we love.  In regards to the party, I took responsibility for myself, but not for the others there. I failed them. But I also realize that sometimes I just can not change the world; I can't change what everyone else thinks and does. For once, I did what was best for me.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I called home Saturday to talk to Mom about my "post graduation" plans. She of course, wants me to move to Griffin and work for the clinic, or to work for one of our friend's clinics. I don't think so. I think that would be murder to me. I told her if I were to do that, I would make her sign a contract that stated the basic "freedoms" of a college person. The right to maintain my own hours, to come and go as I please, and of course, not explain where I am, who I'm with etc.   She wasn't too thrilled at the idea, which didn't surprise me. She said, oh, that's not necessary. Bingo mom - yes it is. As soon as she said that I knew that nothing had changed since I was 17 and living at home for the last time. Forget the fact I've traveled Europe 4 summers, forget the fact that I have been in college, I'm still a helpless 17 year old. Ugh. I told her in response:  Have I ever been arrested? Have I ever called for bail? Have I ever been to the ermergency room? Have I ever called home pregnant?  No.  It got her attention, finally. Dad later sent me an email saying, call me at work, we'll talk without mom. Its not going behind her back, its talking to someone who knows how I feel.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I had dinner with  April  last night, and that was most pleasurable. I don't see her often but when I do its always very nice. We talked about my military offer (oh yeah, I didn't mention that did I?). Basically, I aced the exams and the Army said, "Intelligence Officer". It came to me as a complete surprise. Just something else to add to the complications.  Thats it for this morning, but I'm betting there wil more later.
