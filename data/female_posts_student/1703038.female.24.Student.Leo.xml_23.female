According to  urlLink this article , though, it is and should be replaced with "snowperson" so no one's offended.  In addition to this, the article lists several other words potentital test takers may react negatively to, including "American".  The purpose?  Eliminating class and cultural biases within our testing.  Another example: testers don't believe children in Florida should be required to either write or read essays about snowstorms, while urban children shouldn't be held accountable for their knowledge of crop rotation.  Fine.  It makes sense on one level, and gosh...thanks Iowa Testing or Harcourt or whoever for cushioning my comfort zone so much I don't even have to pretend other cultures exist, but shouldn't testing maybe reflect also how aware the students are of things that are happening outside their county line, especially if the subjects are only adding a "picture frame" for the actual purpose of testing?  I mean, I've never actually experienced a hurricane, but I'm pretty sure I could pick out the parts of speech in a sentence about one.    Testers are also afraid of bringing up "trigger subjects", like bullying or poverty because students may feel bad about their crappy, crappy lives.  In fact, one state (unnamed in the article) has eliminated the term "mobile home" or its derivatives because so many trailer-dwellers take the test.  Is matter of fact real life so dismal that test makers want to pretend it doesn't exist?  I would argue the most compelling, truthful writing these kids could do involves the very subjects we've mainstreamed out of our testing.   On the other hand, with the written portion of the SAT looming in the future of high schoolers, a much more interesting problem is certain to arise: students in wealthy districts who have almost completely transferred note taking, paper writing, and even student-teacher commmunication to electronic forms will be at a marked disadvantage over their less fortunate, rural and urban peers.  I have no doubt when the testers figure this out five years down the road, they'll switch to electronic input immediately which screws the 97% or so of students who don't have laptops at every desk, but in the meantime, the trailer trash, bullies, and snowmen will have their day in sun.*  I just hope colleges and test raters are able to read between the rhetoric and the vanilla-bland subjects, because otherwise we're wasting a whole lot of the class of 2005's time if they can't.    *(Those of you in Washington state or other equally rainy climates may want to substitute a different figure of speech in case you aren't fully comfortable with the word "sun")
