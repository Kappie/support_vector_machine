Yet there are those people who do nothing then they can't understand why they don't pass the class.  Open your eyes people.  Who would ever believe that I would defend the devil teacher to anyone, but I did it.  Well, I feel better now.  On a another note, my day was extremely boring.  I woke up, looked at the computer screen for awhile, and then I watched tv.  The exciting life of Laura.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I've gotta learn to drive.
