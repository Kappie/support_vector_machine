Every saturday morning I sort of teach fencing to juniors for an hour. The kids are wonderful and we enjoy our time. I think they try hard to understand me, remember that my english is not perfect!! Ha ha!  Anyway, back to the subject. Saturday...Well, after talking swords and foils with the kids I went for a coffee with some friends before having lunch at home with my love. My day ended up working at my favourite restaurant where I usually do the dishies!! Finished worked @ 11pm, came back home, watched a bit of TV and went to bed under the warm quilt that Dylan was already stealing...rrr...rrr!  Sunday, ha...Sunday (my favourite day because there is nothing to do except staying in bed all morning long), got up early to go to referee a school team fencing competition at St John's College in a suburb called Belair, near where we live. The kids are cool and they tried so hard to make their team win it was quite fun. I Ccame back home in the afternoon, went for a walk with my prince and we ended up having a coffee at a new coffee shop:  urlLink The Perfect Cup . After this romantic moment we went shopping for food and DVDs for the night. Dylan cooked some kangaroo and I made a pumkin soup with milk. We finally watched Law  Order and then NCIS on TV before going back under the warm blanket again...I think we will keep the DVDs for today's night: we rented "Romeo  Juliet" and "Someone like you"...drama, romantic so everyone is pleased!!  Mondays...rrr...I wish Sundays could last forever...Today is special because we are officialy on holidays so we stayed in bed all morning before going to the city. We booked our seat on the train to go to Sydney and we will probably go to have a cup of coffee before going home...Tonight is fencing and then well, I let you guess...
