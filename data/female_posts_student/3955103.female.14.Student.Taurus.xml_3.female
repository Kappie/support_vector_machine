Haha, I learned a new trick: "How to sleep with my eyes open." I did that while the guy was giving a sermon. Btw, his sermon was completely pointless, like, I didn't know where he was going with it. Anyway, after that I came home and sat on the couch and like passed out. I was soooo way beyond tired. Madison and I tried to go to sleep at like 12:30, but then we wanted popsicles, so we got those, and then we were wired. Like it just came out of nowhere. We threw beeny-babies at my door to try to get it shut, and the next morning my mom walked upstairs and was like, "What the hell? Why are here beeny-babies in the hall?" Haha, it was so funny. And then Madison wrestled with me because she wanted me to go get more popsicles right after I had just come back from downstairs because I got a cup of water. She kept tickling and pinching me with her feet until either:     A.) Shut the door    B.) Got popsicles    C.) Shut the door and got popsicles    it was a very eventful night because we kept laughing and stuff, but anyway.. what to post.      Oh! I had Otter (Michael) and Candace over today to swim with me and Mads. Much fun. Otter leaves for camp tomorrow, so sad. Almost all of Mads' other best friends are leaving for camp, while mine are staying in town!! Haha, in her face! But yeah.. We tried to get Otter to play spoons, its sooo funny how we play. I'll be sitting behind Otter, he will hit Candace on the head with a spoon, and then candace will be like, "1... 2... 3...[bam!]" And I would be the one to hit him on the head with a spoon so it would hurt. We alsogot into a water fight with the hose at first, and water balloons, and then we all jumped in the pool. It was so much fun. And then Madison had this horrible craving for corndogs, so my mom was going to the store to get some stuff and she got her corndogs. There was originally 24, there is now like 10.. all because of her.      So anyway, that was pretty much my day. Who knows, there might be more tonight. Madison is staying the night again for the 13th time in a row, and Candace might be staying the night too, but who knows. This is gonna be some party :P I'll chat ya up later!
