(Or it is at 11 at night, I can't really tell what it would be like when you're actually awake) Ahh... but are you anti-army? It wouldn't work having a world of pacifists, because then idiotic villians would take power. When it comes down to it, the only thing that will get you power is money and violence. Ha, what a great view on the world. I suppose there are people that do good, but there is always an opposition to them, so do they cause that opposition? Wooh. Getting a bit too confusing now. (My mum's reading about quantum physics, and evolution, I guess I get it from her!)
