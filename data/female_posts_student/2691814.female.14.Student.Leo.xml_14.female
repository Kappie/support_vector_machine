There is so much stuff that i could be doing right now but then again my parents wanna stay home. Maybe I should go write a story or something lol. Well tomarrow might be alittle more eventful due to the fact that i'll be watching Charmed  and Dawson's Creek in the morning Buffy the Vampire slayer in the afternoon and more Charmed at night lol. Anyway..Last nights Buffy the Vampire slayer was alittle upsetting. I saw willow(the witch) turn frikkin evil>she may have had a good reason to cuz the character SOB Warren had to shoot her girlfriend. But I was totally happy when she tied his arms and legs to a tree and skinned him.(when i mean skinned him i mean...ALL of his skin came off lol) Too bad those episodes go on air only on weekends I'm already watching season five everyday and i havent' even watched 1-4 yet lol. Oh well i don't care. Im not really a fanatic(well maybe just alil bit)im just a fan of James Marsters who plays Spike(yummy)lol. The show that im a freak about is Charmed...I've seen almost every episode:) I think my mom's worried about me with that cuz today she almost made me watch TV Mass which is a catholic TV show..FIRST OF ALL..im not catholic to begin with second of all she's startin to make me worried that she hates what im doing..(some ppl know what im sayin right?) But anyway, i don't care.
