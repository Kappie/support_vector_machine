I mean, she's trying to prove to people that she can be a different person, and that she's not who she comes off to be, and she ends up proving it to herself more than anyone, and not really caring about what everyone else thinks.  I mean, I try to prove that I'm a certain person, or that I act, or dont act, a certain way. And then I realized that it doesn't really matter what people think, and that I'm not gonna quit and go back to the same old person...and that what really matters is that I can prove who I am to myself. So therefore, I  can  be someone different, but not to make a point to anyone. The only person I have to prove anything to is myself.
