Take it without question, as it is the truth and will not be changed for any reason.   As a whole, I enjoy Orlando Bloom. I enjoy his acting, which I feel is good and strong. I enjoy his personality; he  seems  like a normal, sweet, down-to-earth person. Do I choose do be suspicious of his personality? No. I treat him as I treat all other celebrities I read about - goodwill with a grain of salt. I also enjoy his looks. I do not think there is anything extraordinary about them, but he is nice to look at.   If I heard he had died in a plane crash this very day, of course I would be upset, as I would assume most people would be when they hear of somebody dying in a plane crash. (Except in the case of Britney Spears.) Talent and youth would be lost, [valleygirlvoice] and they'd totally have to rewrite the next POTC movie. [/valleygirlvoice]It would be tragic, HOWEVER. I would not slit my wrists about it.   Further on his good looks, I had not the faintest idea what anybody was talking about (Orlando hot? What the hell...) until the last five minutes of POTC, when he appeared onscreen in a dashing hat to save my favorite character. Then I noticed.   To even progress further backwards, I used to loathe Orlando Bloom in the days of hating LOTR. Anything remotely connected with him or LOTR made me scoff and turn away disgustedly. I did not think he was spectacular when I finally watched FOTR, but he made a good impression.  I do not believe he is up to the acting caliber of Johnny Depp, Jennifer Garner, or David Anders, my true celebrity obsessions. I appreciate these people more than I can possibly say, and that's another blog entry.  To sum it up - I like Orlando Bloom. I do not love Orlando Bloom. I have never kissed a picture or made flirty eyes at a picture of Orlando Bloom. I have, however, smiled at one. There is a solitary picture of him on my door, accompanied by Johnny Depp in the same. (To be specific, it is the scene where Will pulls out his sword and yells "Aye! Avast!")  I will not disguise the fact that I like Orlando Bloom. I will not be convinced to stop enjoying him, unless by chance I hear it for a fact that he has committed murder. (If you wish to quiz me on what would convince me to stop liking Orlando Bloom, I will gladly oblige you, as I am not interested in listing every reason.)  HOWEVER.  If he offends you in any way, I will not mention him in front of you. I will act as though I am completely indifferent to him (and I am close to it, at this point). I will make every effort to have no mention of him in any situation or circumstance around you because I would like the same courtesy done for me. I will not attempt to convince you to like him, nor convince other people to like him. If I have done this in the past, this is the new policy: I will not.   If you let me like Orlando Bloom in peace, I will let you hate Orlando Bloom in peace.   That is all.
