       
      I bought a chicken sandwich for lunch yesterday, and it decided to cause a fuss in my digestive system a few hours later.  Somehow I made it through my psych. class but it wasn't pleasant.  Did lots of reading this morning and now I'm heading back to Steeltown.  The weeks fly by sometimes... Next week, with May 24 and CALSS not scheduled for Tuesday (an exception), I will be much less busy.  Never did hear from my sup. about scheduling a meeting.  We last met on January 7.  More to come...
