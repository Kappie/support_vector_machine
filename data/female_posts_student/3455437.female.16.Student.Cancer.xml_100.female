I better start doing homework and study so I'm ready for the preliminarys. *sigh*  After school Benjitamatron and Simono came over, we ate -so- much icecream.. it was scary! >.>   .>  We also watched White Oleander, I love that movie but it makes me sad. Benji is gone now, Simona is going soon. She is..  Her mum just arrived.   She's gone.  . . I'm all alone!! TT_TT Heh, I'm really busy at the moment, I still don't have time to draw which is pissing me off because really that is all I want to do..it's the only thing that makes me happy. :3  Akira just got home. She got her hair cut!!!! It looks cool! o_0  It's all short and flippy-out-ee.   I might dye my hair brown soon. Maybe this weekend.   My mums coming back on Sunday. I have to clean up. :(  The house is so trashed. Kay, I better go make dinner.   Peace.
