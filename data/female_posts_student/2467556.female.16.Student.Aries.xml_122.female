Anyways, today i got lots of people to sign my yearbook, it was exciting!  I was "annoyed" at Nathaniel today at lunch because i had to beg him for TEN MINUTES to sign my yearbook and then he runs off and asks Lindsay if he can sign hers!!  What is that!?!  Lol, not really, i just gave him a hard time about it.  Otherwise, school was great yay.  Last night, me and Lindsay made an acronym for Adam Havens because we saw him shirtless (but i don't remember them all so bear with me): A - admirable D - desirable A - (?) M - man i want your body  H - HOTT A - almost no one is cuter V - vivacious hair (don't ask lol) E - eww you have a girlfriend N - no one beats your gorgeous smile S - smile is sooo cute!   ^haha isn't it great?!?  we should make one for every hott guy! it was so much fun!  Alright so at the dentist, i had to get these fillings and stuff and i swear they got me high on laughing gas.  I was seriously immobilized for 10 minutes, i felt like my body was 100 lbs heavier than usual.  I couldn't think straight and i was drifting in and out of what the dentist lady was telling me about my teeth, i kept on having random memories come to my head and i couldn't remember anything the lady had told me.  AND when i got up, i fell over and my head felt like it was swimming.  It was not a good feeling.    this year is almost over and it feels like it started yesterday......i feel like just a week ago i was a freshman and now all of the sudden i'm a junior!  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
