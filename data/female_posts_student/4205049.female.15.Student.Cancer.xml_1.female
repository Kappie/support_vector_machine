Besides the fact that it rained like all day, so I couldn't go out on courtyard in the morning or in the afternoon during lunch, but by the time the other lunches came around, it probably wasn't raining. I got in a big fight yesterday with Devon. He told me that if I came over to his house that he was going to whoop my behind, so I didn't go over to his house. I haven't seen him since. But the reason I didn't go over to his house is because it was raining all night and you can't go out in the rain. I meant to tell his brother, Courtland, that I really needed to talk to him and that I was sorry and that I was just playing around...becuase I was...he just has to understand that. Today during lunch my friend, Katie, got mad at me because I stole her brothers soda because he wouldn't stop making a rustling noise with the wraper to his honey bun, and she called us immature. Then later on, I threw a nickel at her, and her brother's friend Justin, blamed it on Peter (her brother), Peter blamed it on me, and I blamed it on Peter. So, Katie called us immature, told me to give me her bookbag and she got up and went to the library. So, like I went to the library like 5 minutes later and I said "as a friend, I thought that I should come after to see why you were mad." And she said "because ya'll were acting immature and I don't want to put up with it." and I asked her how we were acting immature and she told me that me stealing her brothers soda was immature and then me throwing the nickel was immature. I told her highschool is the last 4 years that we are going to remember and we are gonna want to have good memorys. We don't want to have no memorys or boring memorys. But anyways....I am going to be home alone tonight...which I hate. I hate being home alone because I get scared and I think that someone is in my house and all this other stuff, but I don't think my mom cares, but that is just how I feel. I hope me and Devon can work through our problems because I really still want to be friends with him....his is really kool and really sweet. When I got home from school, I went to Devon's house and I apologized to him and he told me not to worry about it, but he couldn't really have company that day because I guess it was cleaning day or something, so I went home after that.
