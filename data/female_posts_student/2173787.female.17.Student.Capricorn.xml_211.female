Since there are only two weeks left I don't feel the need to fight so hard to fit into my little spot.  Instead I was able to let loose and dance, albeit poorly.  My life is changing.  For once I can feel it.  In a way its kind of like special relativity, even though I'm always moving forward I don't feel it unless the process accelerates or decelerates.  Right now I'm accelerating. In a way my life feels a lot like driving home tonight.  The windows were down, it was dark and the music was blaring.  But with all of those distractions I still felt one with the car, one with the road.  There is no greater feeling than driving fast on dark windy roads.   It makes me feel simultaneously in control and out of control.  And that's what life feels like right now, a dark windy road.  Yet while I'm ready to press down the accelerator and see where this road leads I can't help but look in the rear-view mirror wistfully at what I'm leaving behind.  So, I'm off to bed to dream happy dreams and do some serious thinking about which road to take at the next intersection that comes my way.   One more thing...Assertiveness is a good thing.
