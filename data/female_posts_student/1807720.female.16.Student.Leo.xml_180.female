Afterwards I feel so good.  Exercise is like the medicine for happiness I swear.  When I got home my mom and I went to Tim Hortons and got a BLT bagel combo and we also tried those celebration cakes.  They were so good!!  Then we ran a whole bunch or erins and she also showed me how to get to Bishop Grandin.  I can't believe school starts again on Friday, but I am happy I signed up for Summer School.  It's better than being bored out of your mind.  I also applied at Safeway in Southland cause I haven't got any callbacks from all the places I applied.  My resume is awesome, I mean there is nothing wrong there.  I mean I am an honours student and do like a thousand things within the community and school, and still no call back.  Maybe it's the hours I request to work.  I mean I can't exactly work every hour of my life like other losers out there that don't have a life.  I mean I still have to focus on Summer School, that is my main priority and that comes first.  I woke up this morning and it felt so calming.  I had left my window open last night so when I woke up I could hear the rain pouring down and hitting the window and the side of the house.  It was peaceful.  I have to go shower soon and then drive my mom to the Rocky View.  Then basically I have to do everything - dishes, cleaning, feeding cat and bunnies, the list goes on.  I also have to drive her everywhere, but luckily I have a car and can drive now.  I also have to drive to the airport to pick up my Dad.  He is coming home from Vancouver tomorrow.  He is going to live with us again.  It is going to seem so strange.  It used to be strange enough when my dad came back for every second weekend, and now he like is going to be here permenantly.  I guess I will get used to it, but at first it's going to seem really strange.  Last night I also went to go see The Notebook.  That was a good movie.  Oh, I also found this really good scholaship I am going to apply for.  I am not going to say what the name is though cause then my friends would be competing against me.  There are like five categories you can chose to enter and I am choosing the Performing Arts Category.  I have to write an essay and stuff, fill out the application form.  Then you can also include four additional pages of evidence, proof, and like examples of what you did or can do.  I have the best idea.  It's too bad though that we couldn't video tape the play though cause video, cds, etc are allowed.  That is going to be the real competition.  Anyways I am going to write about the experience in the play.  Then for my examples and stuff I am including the program guide, two pic on two pieces of paper to show it, and then I am going to ask Mr. B for a letter of reference.  Except what I am going to do to make mine stand out is that I am going to use this tissue paper kind of art thing I was taught in grade 7.  Instead of just attaching the pics to blank pages I am going to make like a background kind of thing and since we did "A Mid Summer Night's Dream" I am going to make like moons and starts part of the background.  That is going to be like the theme.  Then on the envelope that I am going to send it in, I am going to do just a little simple art design like that.  It's creative, and original.  I don't think everyone will do something like it.  I hope that it will make in stand out, and just noticeable.  I believe I have a very good shot at this.  I am going to do my best to get this.
