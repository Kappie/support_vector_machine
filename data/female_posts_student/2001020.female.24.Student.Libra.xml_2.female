I mean, I haven't since I've been back at school, so the appeal of alcohol has already started to wear off, but will I get a second wind when I turn 21? Oh, boy, I'm superexcited about all of this. I mean, it's not life changing or anything, but it kinda is! People tell me it gets old quick, but that's fine. Now there's nowhere I can't go because I'll be 21...I'll finally be able to go the big girl bars, where normal people my age hang out!
