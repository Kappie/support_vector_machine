FREEDOM!! FREEDOM!! hee hee hee hee hee!!! i am getting a pair of boots to go with my short skirts, they are £19, and soooo cool, well, i'm not entirely certain i'm getting them bu close enough to certain!! i can see i am gonna go on a blabber again so if ur bored already save the rest for another day!!! my sis is getting boots aswell. but she wants ones like samanthas slouch boots. shocking news: MY BROTHER IS THE SAME HEIGHT AS ME! AAAAGGGGHHHH! for the first time in my life i feel short! was reminded this christams of all the people from chessington and all the m8's i left behind. (Ben, Katharine, Sarah, Vivki, Katie, Adam, etc,etc). good piece of advice; never agree to move house, unless u are staying in the same town! what brought all this on was the crimbo letter we got from denise (bens mum), we always get one cos me and ben and liam were quite close (cos ben was 10 days older than me), we always shared parties etc and my mum and his mum were good friends so every year we get a Scorer update letter ! it seems strange to be part of someones life when you live soo very far away! we haven't been on the relative trail yet but when we do go there are gifts waiting for us! YAY! i really wanna get more pressies and more money and more more more!!! *mmm....slight power mad moment there!* right must shut up, i always end up writing tonnes, i could sit here and type for hours, of course i wud probably repeat myself a couple of times!! and for those of u who r dumb enuf to have not worked out y i am excited, its becos i get to c tim sometime in the near future!! YAY! bye xoxoxox
