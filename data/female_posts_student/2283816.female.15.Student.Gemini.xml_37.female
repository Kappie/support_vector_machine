This is a list of people/things that imspire me or that I admire - I got the idea from the song "La Vie Boheme" from RENT. It's quite a cool song.  Alias RENT Fiddler on the Roof Jules Verne Pizza PBJ sandwiches musicals Broadway Idina Menzel Eoin Colfer apples strawberries chocolate Van Gogh coffee Pirates of the Caribbean alcohol bubbles camisoles Agatha Christie JJ Abrams Wicked Jennifer Garner Victor Garber David Anders Catherine Zeta-Jones Renee Zellweger JK Rowling Louis Sachar jazz classical music Tchaikovsky Liz Phair Sarah McLachlan Evanescence Norah Jones Sara Evans  There's obviously more, but I have dinner. If i think of more, then ... I'll blog!
