I'm not sure I like having to run around for all of these incompetent people (one in particular, but we won't get into names). Time to go to lunch, I will write more later.    Okay, I am back from lunch. It was uber-yummy. Mmmmmmmmmm. I am just sitting at the desk now, relishing my down-time. Not much is going on now, and I think I like it this way. It gives me plenty of time to update my blog and listen to the radio.    Nothing much has been going on in the life of Annie. This week is going to be full of boring entries, since I am actually doing work and not having typical Annie-ish adventures. At least I'm working and making that money, *bling* *bling*!!! Now I'm not the only one who's gainfully employed- there's a certain penguin out there who's playing with wires- WATCH OUT!!! I am really happy and proud of you, babe- keep up the good work and don't get electrocuted (without at least having me be there to laugh, lol)!    I guess I'm just going to keep myself busy by going online and continuously drinking Coke. Ahem- I said  drinking  not  snorting  for those of you with your minds in the gutter... Like all of you! Besides, I can't afford it. LOL!!! At least the soda's free!    I suppose that on that note I will leave you. Peace out to all my homies in the 'hood! Stay real!!!
