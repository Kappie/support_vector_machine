Hmm... hope it won't be too cold. (Are you kidding? Your fingers will probably drop off!) Oh yeah... hehe... he. Not good. Ah heck! It'll be fun! They speak Russian *whatever*, German and English in their school which is a bit of a damn cause I speak English, French, Spanish and a bit of Russian! Damn, why didn't I learn German!
