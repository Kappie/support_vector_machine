I just talked to Gavin a couple of minutes ago. I like talking to him. He puts me in a good mood. And most of you know that I haven't been in a very good mood lately. I just can't explain it. I feel like I'm floating after I talk to him. It's weird and I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I do and I don't know why. This just happened within the past 2 days too. I can't explain it. It's just this non-stop-smile, feel-tingly-all-over, weak-at-the-knees sorta feeling. I've never felt like that before,   ever.   And I think I like feeling this way. I think.  Well, that's what I'm thinking right now. I probally shouldn't of written it but I promised myself I would write freely in here no matter who reads it. So here ya go. An insite into my life and the real me. I hope you like it, I hope you like me.  I'm getting off for the rest of the night now. Maybe I'll write tomorrow. I never know what's going on until the morning so you never know. Well good night, sweet dreams, and all that great stuff.   Love always,   Kelly    (What's gotten into me with all this lovey-dovey stuff? Wow I need help.)
