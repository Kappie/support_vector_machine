The whole situation is actually somewhat sad considering I've had a little paper that says I have my license since January. It only took seven months... Now that is procrastination. I also got my thank you letters written up for my trip to Mexico.  Around 4:00 Ellen and I picked up her friend Sarah and we all headed out to Westmoreland mall, where I met up with Tyler. It was nice to see him. I worry though, because sometimes when I'm with him or talking to him, I can't think of a single thing to say. I personally think words are over rated and that it's more important to just be content in someone's presence. I guess I just worry about what he thinks about our relationship. I don't think he realizes how important his is to me. I probably should just ask him what he thinks. This whole thing is hard for me. I'm afraid to get attached because it means I might actually need someone else. I've always done things my own way and on my terms. What if I can't do it on my own? I'm so, so afraid of getting hurt again. No one wants to be used... Not that I think Tyler's motives are the wrong ones or that he doesn't mean all the things he says to me. I believe him, and that scares me most of all. I really do try to keep my chin up and look for the good in everything, but sometimes the world makes it hard to believe in good.  Anyways, Tyler and I went to see the Manchurian Candidate last night while Ellen and Sarah walked around the mall. I'm not sure exactly what I thought about that movie. The plot was somewhat twisted and a few of the scenes really bothered me. I'd have to see it again to decide whether I liked it or not. My sister sent a text message to Tyler's phone in the middle of the movie that read, "Stop making out." She's a punk. LOL.  Well today I'm stuck here babysitting Nacci and his friend Nolan. The madre took my car under the guise of wanting to save money on gas. I'm not sure I believe that. Later on today I think I'm going to go apply for a job at the bank. Very random, I know.
