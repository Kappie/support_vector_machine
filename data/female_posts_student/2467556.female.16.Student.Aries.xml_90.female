Thats amazing!  yeah and vote for Jake Ross on Nadia's poll called "Who's the sexiest man alive?"  because Jake is my buddy and he's awesome, lol.  I drove today and did fine but my mom swears i almost killed some people including ourselves.  I swear i had complete control of the car.  We weren't going to die.    Sports Update: Dallas plays San Jose today and if we win, we're 2 points (one win) away from taking SJ down.  It's on now.  Coppell plays Jesuit this week, which is a game you definitley want to go to because its the last one and it'll be extreme.  The only problem is that its at 9:30pm......but you should try to come anyways.  I'm more than likely going to go and i'm going to kidnap Brittany if her parents don't let her go.  And then Brittnee the Lariette is probably going too because its later at night.  Allison will more than likely go if she doesn't have a soccer game.  I'll be missing the Coppell vs. Marcus game over spring break, but we're going to win that one for sure so its all cool.    hmmmm i should probably be studying and rereading the chapter for world history.....but i think i'll wait and do it later.....after the hockey game....and maybe later after that....  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
