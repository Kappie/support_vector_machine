Here goes:    This is my life     a poem by: Meghan   The world I live in, Is dull and grey, If I could change it, I would say;  To heck with the world, And all that dwell within, This is my life,  not yours to fill in.  But I'm only sixteen, Not ready to fight, This world will try to change me In the matter of one night.  I am smart, I am kind, But the life in my eyes, Is starting to unwind.  She was too smart, She was too kind, They won't realize, What they've killed inside.  My curiousity, My spunk, My wit, My pride, In my mind,  I'm starting to hide.  I won't come out,  I don't fit in, The slideshow of my life Is about to begin.  Laughter rings from the world's mouth, My life seems a hoax, Nothing but a little girl's attempt At turning the wheel's spokes.  This laughter it kills, What was hanging on so tight, The hope I once had, Takes it's last flight.  Time is running out,  Luck is in the past,  My life is running away, And running away fast.   You can't catch me, O wicked world and those within, I'm to lost now, My life is at it's end.  I take my last breath, As I start to drown, In the words that were spoken, By the world's crowd.  The world rings out "Silly Girl!" washed away in an instant. The threat she once posed, Is now but distant.  As the world reviews the video of my life, They suddenly realized, How one mistake, Could cause so much strife.  The mistake that they made, was not believing in me. But now it's too late, For mere apologies.  Listen carefully to what I say, Do not give into the world and all it's beliefs. Your life should be lived, Without such grief.  A burden to share,  Is a burden much less. Live your life through no other, Let your heart rest.  Say to the world: "To heck with you and all that dwell within, This is MY LIFE, It's not yours to fill in."   Ahem, so ya.  That was my poem. And it's pretty long so I think that's all I'm going to write today. :-P    It's My Life-Don't You Forget.
