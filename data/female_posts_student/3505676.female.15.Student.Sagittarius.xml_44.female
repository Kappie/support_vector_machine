Then met up with Christine [[thank you for getting up so early just to see ME]] and we talked for a bit watching the swim team kids until Shawn *lifeguard and swim team coach* pushed me in and then we swam some laps and talked..or both @ the same time [[bobbing up and down down the lanes--haha] Clint took his lesson kids over to join us *lol* and that was all just very silly. Got changed for work then christine left around 11:55 right b4 i hadta work!  Worked with Mary in the morning [[she's nice...old]] and then with Josh @ 2.  Yesterday was fun cuz the shift supervisors rocked yesterday--alison (another one) and Kim.  Fun girls right there! Got off around 7 and went home, gave dad his late b-day present *it was monday* It was a bumper sticker that said "My kids only see me as an ATM." =D  Watched tv with Jill and then talked to brad until it was his bedtime! [I'm gonna go on strike so that he doesn't hafta work as much] Read some hardball, then went to sleep!  Today: working from 2-close but Alli's picking me up in about an hour to swim laps and hang out.
