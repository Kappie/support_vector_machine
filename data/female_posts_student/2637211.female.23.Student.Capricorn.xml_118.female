I don't think I want to watch a bunch of movies by Thursday, so I think I need to pick a better topic. I'm too stuck in WWII. This quarter has been altogether too much about that damn war. Too much synergy--everything I learn in school is so freakin' relevant to current events, it can get aggravating. I love history, but I've gotten so obsessed with the present. I need to know what is happening in the world, like I can somehow predict an outcome to it all. And who even knows? Big themes in history are interesting and all, but then something wacky and terrible makes it all seem pointless, like that 1918 influenza outbreak that killed more people than any of the horrors of WWI. Will it matter if George W. or Kerry or Edwards is our president when the coastal cities begin to flood, and mass chaos ensues? Who knows. I'm sick of analyzing it all, but that's probably the end of the quarter talking. History is my love, I cannot leave it.
