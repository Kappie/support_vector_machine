I thought it was so interestin dat i had to tell everyone =) If yall wonderin, which undoubtedly u are, i went on a biology excursion!!  I had to get up at 5 in the friggin cold mornin n haul my asss up to school by 7:30. Not a very good start to the day but it soon got betta. I met up with my bio buddies,  Nita  n  Mei , at schoool n then caught a bus all the way to Collary beach. We wondered around the rock pools, caught a pretty big octopus and named him  wilbert . Haha he escaped a few times n sucked his way over to the water. We had to try n pick him up n put him back in his tub so we cud draw him. Highlight of the day =) we walked over to the other side of the rock pools to observe sum lumps of green jelly in the water. The tide was comin in so we didn't have much time but the view was completely breathtaking. Staring into that huge expanse of blue ocean, with the waves rolling high and white foam hissing away at our feet was my idea of paradise =) it was so serene n peaceful, i could have sat there all day n be completely happy. If i learned nethin today it would be that nature IS beautiful.  I saw soo many amazing things. Have u ever seen a whole flock of birds fly in a V formation? I dunno why but it jus leaves me in awe. That whole idea of team work, with one lone bird at the front taking the hit n reducing the wind drag for others, then swapping around when he gets to tired... ok i sound like a nerd. But it makes u wonder why, if animals do it instinctively, humans find it difficult. Hahaha then agen i also saw a pelican with a fish in its mouth being chased by a flock of seagulls...  Newaiz by lunch time our shoes were completely soaked n full of sand. Lucky we brought spare shoes, which is more than i can say for poor Nita. haha silly gurl... after lunch we had to trek up a huge hill to see a special type of hairy grass. That really pissed me off cuz I was so tired n i'm sure everyone else was too. After another trek back to the bus, we went back to school. I slept the whole way =)  Now I'm at home and sick cuz i got wet, but i swear it was SOOOO worth it! Hrmm i really should get out more often....  Thats all for me =) laters ellagators!!
