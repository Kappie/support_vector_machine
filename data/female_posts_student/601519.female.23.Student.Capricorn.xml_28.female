 But strangely, I'm not in the mood to be online anymore. 

 Hell, I have a report due tomorrow and I'm still reading silly novels today. I need to stop, but I don't  want  to stop. I want to say fuck everything! 

 I think next semester, if I pass this semester, I'll ask Mom to take me to another psychiatrist. Sigh. This is just too ridiculous for words.
