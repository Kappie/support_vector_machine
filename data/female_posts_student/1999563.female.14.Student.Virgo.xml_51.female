These guys  named Eric and Evan sit behin dme in Spanish and  they were all talking about how today was a good day because the first thing they saw was a buncha girls in tight pants....:O Then they were talking about how hot cheerleaders are. *Sigh* When will the one come for me? I keep thinking that SOME day God will put the perfect guy in my life so loves me for WHO I am not if I look good in tight pants. It feels like I will never find the one.  Today I went to rowing. I GOT TO GO WITH THE NEWBIES! Oooh my goodness! It was so much fun! I was like the best person in the boat so I got to stroke. It was so sitnkin cool.. I was with the fun newbies too. We sang "Row, Row, Row, the Boat," had a joke contest, and talked about random stuff. It was soo much fun!  When we were lifting the boat out of the water Emily's glasssed fell of and INTO the water! :O It was badd....I do not know th eoutcome of the situation though cuz I had to leave early.  Today these construction peoples came to our house to dig a huge hole in our yard and they CUT THE WATER PIPE. So we didn't have any water till like   a half an hour ago. I couldn't use the bathroom and I had to go realllllllllly bad. It was not fun. So we went out to eat cuz my mom couldn't cook. It was greta. We went to Baha Fresh and I got enchaladas. YUM! Then we went straight to youth group. Youth group was so much fun tonight! Its good to have a break from life and focus on God. After, we went to the christian book store and I got my brand spankin NEW Thousand foot Krutch CD!!! YAY!  You should get it tooo.   Uh oh.  My mom is making me leave. EEPs!  BYE! I love YOU! :D  ~Laurinaaaaa~
