The little shit wouldn't even commit to spending the night here, though he was eventually convinced.  I hate the person I am around him.  Manipulative, bitchy, jealous, bitter, short-tempered, weak and pathetic.     Manipulative:    I asked him if he had informed his ex-girlfriend about my existence.  He said he had told her he was "sleeping with someone."  Sleeping with someone? Am I just someone he fucks? Well, yes.  He does care for me as a person, as a friend, but in the end, I am really just someone he fucks. Well fuck that.  I told him to leave and I told him I didn't want to see him again for a very long time.  Then as he tried to walk out the door, I blocked his path, slammed the door shut and burst into tears.  I don't ever intend to be melodramatic, but it happens over and over again.     Bitchy:    I grilled him on the visitation arrangements.  Shiana, shena, shiena, whatever the little cunt's name is, is visiting Mr. David at the end of July.  Had they talked about getting back together, I asked.  He was non-communicative at best.  I know they tell each other that they miss each other. I know he still loves her and she still probably loves him. I take back the part about her being a cunt, I would do nothing less than what she has done.  Actually, she has handled herself remarkably well and has acted far classier than I.  She's visiting, as friend, and that's all, so he claims.  Then again, I am a friend and that is all.  I know they will end up back together, yet I let the hope that they won't torture me.     Jealous:   When I was looking for the parking garage ticket, I went through his wallet.  He still has a photo of his ex-girlfriend, who is, honestly, not much of a looker.  Not ugly, just not a hottie.  I couldn't help but feel slighted nonetheless. I know I am better in bed than she is, I know David is more attracted to me than to her.  He told me so in one of his weaker moments of actual honesty. (He prides himself on his honesty, but he is very confused as to what that word means.  Honesty is not the absence of lies.  Honesty also requires openness and forthrightness, which he altogether lacks).  Still, he loves her and he doesn't love me and that drives me insane.  I realize that if a stranger were to read this blog, Mr. David would not come across as the really great guy that he is.  This unjustified animosity toward him and resentment I harbor against him is another attribute on the list of things I hate about myself.   Bitter:  Mr. David is extremely affectionate in the morning.  He holds me close and won't let me leave when I try to get up to take a shower.  Just a little bit longer, he says.  He kisses the top of my head, which is pressed against his chest.  He smells good, he always smells good.  I should be happy, but I am not.  Because all of this affection, all of this domesticity is just a FUCKING ILLUSION.  I am not his girlfriend, I am just someone he is FUCKING.  And all that FUCKING bitterness gets in the way of me enjoying our truly pleasurable moments, such as lying in bed together.   Short-tempered:  In addition to the door slamming incident, I also snapped at him for various things, including his refusal to say whether or not he was going to spend the night, his inability to return my phone calls, and his unwillingness to make definite plans to see me again before he flies back east.   Weak and pathetic:  Did I mention Mr. David is also a classmate?  We attend the same prestigious law school back east.  We hate the same toolish students that populate our school.  We are both social misfits, both fiercely intelligent, and both unable to apply that intelligence in socially acceptable manner that is needed to climb the academic ladder.  I don't give a shit about gerunds, I don't care about comma splices (obviously) and sure as fuck don't give a shit about  urlLink the bluebook  (the book detailing the inane rules for documenting law review articles).  I like Mr. David because he is unique and aloof and independent from the crowd. I like Mr. David because he is passionate about ideas, but not in that fake academic way. I like Mr. David because he can play a mean riff.  I like Mr. David because he is really fucking amazing in bed.  I like him, i like him, sometimes, I think I even love him. And yet. And yet, I know he is very very bad for me.  I need some one who loves me.  Some one to be my advocate.  Yes, that is weak and pathetic.  I should be able to get by with friends and family.  But I can't.  I need a boyfriend. I need someone who can re-assure all my insecurities.  Well.  Not just any boyfriend.  I need someone who I can love. And that means someone I can admire, someone: smart, funny, independent, socially outside the box, artistically involved, honest, kind, compassionate and loving.  And Mr. David is those things, except that Mr. David doesn't love me. And that should be enough to send a girl of my intelligence RUNNING away and  FIGHTING him off is he tries to pursue.  But what do  I ?  I FUCK him.  Why?  Because I am weak and pathetic. And in the end, not all that intelligent.  So we departed ways Saturday afternoon.  He went off to mix his demo.  I went off to see Mario, friend of MR. Vince and hopefully a friend of mine as well.  Mario and I had a good time.  We went to  urlLink club spaceland . The same place I saw  urlLink the standard .  Incidentally, there name needs to be changed.  There is no way that they will ever hit the top of the google list, unless their fans bother to google-fix/google-bomb them.  Anyway, so Mario is very cool.  Unfortunately, I think I may have pissed him off somehow.  Though I wasn't getting a vibe from him before, now I wonder if maybe he was interested in me and I upset him by telling him that I had a crush on Mr. Vince.  I won't bother with the details, but to make a long story short. Well not too short.  Last time Mario and Mr. Vince and I hung out Mario mentioned to Mr. V, that he thought I liked him (referring to Mr. V). MR. V, in turn, said, "no, I think she likes you" (referring to Mario).  Mario, told me this, ostensive in order to illustrate what a nice guy Mr. V is.  You see Mario has not had very good luck with women recently (actually something very very sad happened between him and his last serious girlfriend, and was definitely not Marioâ€™s fault), so Mr. V, as Mario was explaining, was trying to be a good friend to Mario.  But I wonder.  Was Mr. V really being nice and giving Mario the okay sign to pursue me? Or was Mr. V trying to pass me off onto his friend because he is not interested?  We shall see.  Anyway, I really like Mario.  As I said, he is very cool. So I hope I didn't accidentally upset him.  And I hope that doesn't seem to egotistical to think he might have been interested in me.   Blah blah.  My love life is a mess.  I know was in love with Mr. Rod, but we can never ever be together (the subject of a future post, I am sure).  I think I could have fallen in love with Mr. Pete, if it hadn't been for the fact that I was in love with Mr. Rod, so Mr. Pete dumped me right after I made a real commitment to make the relationship work.  So I tried to get over Mr. Pete (or rather over the humiliation of being rejected and the frustration of a lost opportunity). I might be in love with Mr. David, but he is not in love with me.  And I have HUGE crush on Mr. Vince, whose friend Mario, might have taken a small interest in me.  I have no one to blame but myself. But fault or not fault, my love life is still a fucking train wreck.  But at least I am getting tan.  Oh incidentally, since my love life is such a mess, I shall reserve the MR. title for boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, lovers, would-be lovers, etc.  Friends, enemies, non-entities, shall remain untitled.  Brief recap of today and then time for ambien and bed.  1) slept in until noon. 2) daydreamt about Mr. Vince 3) finally got around and made it to the beach 4) read for three hours.   5) went home and cooked dinner 6) played Mr. Vince's guitar 7) Read some more 8) wrote this blog entry.  Well that's all for now folks.  Ha! Folks! well, I guess you are never too old for imaginary friends.
