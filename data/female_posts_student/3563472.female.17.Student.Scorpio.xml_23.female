Anyways, County Fair Queen Contest coming up! Oh boy.... I have quite a few friends in it... so i guess i'm obligated in some way to go. I think it will be mildly fun. And the fair should be exciting. I hope I see my Mid Prairie friends. How I love them. hahah.  I think I may go to Iowa City tonight. It will be exciting, and I need excitement. But i may have to kill a herky or two. Everytime mere sees one she says "I hate those f-ing herkies. If they had tires, I'd slash 'em" It makes me hot.  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Go rent it. I did last night. It was great.
