But when you think about it, it was kind of pointless (you'll understand what i mean by this when you see the movie). But to warn those that don't appreciate things like this there are a few nude scenes, and sex scenes, and plenty of swearing. But if you can get past that, it was an all together good movie. I recommend if you get the chance to watch it. Girls, watch it with someone, lol, it's not scary, but it'll be better if someone is there with you.
