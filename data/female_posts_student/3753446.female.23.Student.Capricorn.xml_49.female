We consoled her best we could and it was then that we knew: we were in for an interesting night.  The drama began when we realized that three separate and very different people had invited us out for fireworks. After a half hour of discussing the matter and coming to no conclusion, we decided to discuss it over a sushi dinner.  Restaurant Japan is my favorite sushi venue in Columbus. I initially found out about it on a date with someone I bought at a date auction (go figure). We ordered the Caterpillar roll, Idaho roll, Tokyo roll, and Spider roll. As well as two pieces of Nigiri: fresh salmon and big sweet shrimp (with "fried head"). It was a lot of fun looking sushi actually, and tasted awesome (almost competing with Sushi Samba in Chicago, the most expensive sushi dinner I've ever had). We took pictures of the fried head battling it out with the Caterpillar head over a bed of wasabi. Ruthie tried her first piece of sushi (Idaho roll, a veggie roll) and she loved it! I love introducing people to sushi. I got my sisters started, my dad, Aaron, and now Ruthie. In any case, after dinner we still didn't know exactly what our plans were, so we decided to do that on the drive to Oren's for his barbecue.  On the drive we decided that after the barbecue we'd likely be with Oren's crew so it would be easier to just go with them, so that's what we did. Cancelling on two of my dearest friends though, was not easy. I hate cancelling on people, and I hate cancellations myself. Two phone calls later, and we three ladies were in the clear. We could only hope that the barbecue would be a blast.  After parking the car, all we could smell was vomit. That's always a good sign huh. It was a rooftop party, so if the barf was making it to the ground, then someone up there must be having fun, right? We worked our way to the top floor apartment and Oren showed us the way to the roof. A ten foot ladder fom Lowes, pointed through the access door. I hate things that shake when I'm climbing them. It was so nervewracking climbing that thing, in a skirt for that matter. Eeew. Sorry down below!   We talked on the roof for a good hour and a half, all of us non-drinker ladies with our diet vanilla cokes. It was then that I realized for the first time that Oren was not a law student! I don't know exactly how that one got by me, but we cleared it up fast. Getting fifteen people to the fireworks after that was a complicated venture. After calling cabs that never came, we ended up setting out with one car (mine) and the rest on foot!   Ruthie, Kat, Scott, Quincy (Oren's friend) and I ended up seeing the fireworks together really close to the bridge off Marconi. We were next to a radio that was playing the fireworks music, and we had an AMAZING view. Those were by far the most spectacular fireworks I have ever seen in my whole life! As Ruthie and I discussed, it was like your own personal fireworks show. My favorite part was Louis Armstrong's "Its a Wonderful World" segment. They had fireworks go up for each color mentioned in the song ("trees of green" "red roses"). Its one of my favorite songs! Props to the Red White and Boom coordinators.  After that we hit up Brothers and danced to music none of us have heard since junior high. I mean, who ever listens to Rumpshaker anymore? Kat and Ruthie and I cut out a little early and drove home. In the car they spent a half hour trying to convince me that I was dating someone (seeing them, to be more specific) without realizing it. First of all, is that even possible? If I don't see it as dating then it's not dating right? In any case, I'm soooo terrible with mixed signals. I've gotten in big trouble with that before. Now I'm a little confused, because its not someone I'm all that interested in, and nothing has been made very clear. But they are two of my dearest gal pals, and I gotta give them some credit for the investigative work. So I told them that I just broke up with him. Cuz after all, if he never informed me that we were seeing eachother, I don't have to inform him that I'm ending it. Anyway, altogether it definitely turned out to be the interesting night we though it'd be.  To conclude, the following is an email I received from the coordinator of my MD PhD program. When I interviewed for the program a year ago, I was dubbed "A firecracker" by the director. Since then, the name has stuck. Here's the email. Its not hilarious, but its amusing. I thought it was cute that she remembered.    My little firecracker,   Please beware of strange firecrackers.  Stick to sparklers...   Ashley
