Come to think of it, methinks this is my first dentist appointment for ages. I can't remember when was the last time i went to have my oral cavity checked or examined. goodness gracious me .. no wonder my gums are acting up! i havent been heeding the well-known recommendation that one should go and see her dentist at least every half-yearly. Well, at least ive been brushing my teeth twice daily and changing my toothbrush every 3 months.   ( hahaha.. i remember the dentist i used to see when i was a kid .. he was Indian. a very nice man, and his twin worked in the same practice as well. their dad who is also a dentist even has a road in kuching named after him ..this dentist dude was MY dad's  friend or something. BEWARE: what i am about to write about next has absolutely NOTHING to do with TEETH or GUMS or Dentistry. i must've been about 8 or 9 , and at that age, i was not only a magpie, i was an INQUISITIVE magpie. at that age, i had already decided i wanted to be a doctor when i grew up, and i thought, well if i want to be a doctor i should know about things related to the human body. things like how babies were made... hahaha.. so i approached dad and asked him, ' dad, how are babies made?' hahah.. i cant really remember how dad reacted to my question but no .. dont worry, he didnt go on to tell me about the birds and the bees and all that crap .. he simply said , ' well.. since tomorrow you are going to see the dentist, why dont you ask him? afterall, a dentist is a kind of doctor ..' so the next day, in came the eight year old me, about to have her tooth extracted or cavity filled ( i cant remember!!) and asked the dentist the exact same question i had asked my dad. sorry pple.. i cannot remember his answer .. what i DO remember is i left the surgery feeling still VERY dissatisfied with whatever reply he gave .. i still did not know how babies were made. guess my good ol' dad sensed my dissatisfaction .. and later he gave me a BOOK ( nope .. not about sex but about raising babies) .. and i think there mustve been a chapter in there about answering questions like mine.. but for crying out loud, I WAS ONLY IN PRIMARY TWO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i guess i just gave up trying to find out how babies are made ..but don't worry, being an ex-Lodgian ( nothing against Lodge, but if you wr an ex-Lodgian yourself.. you might understand .. ), i managed to get the answer to my question in primary 4. ( haiyah .. that sounded kinda dodgy .. sorry ! some smart alec told me laah) hahaha..the point i am trying to make here is : WHAT WAS DAD THINKING WHEN HE TOLD ME TO ASK MY DENTIST ABOUT SEX? ( i guess i should be forgiven for actually asking the dentist cos i was only eight .... )  anyways , back to the present day .. with the 24 year-old me .. who knows what there needs to be known about human reproduction ( NB: Im a MEDICAL student and an obstetrician-wannabe .. so dont start having a dodgy impression of me  now ... !!!), i am kinda intimidated by the thought of seeing the dentist. hopefully i would get a proper dentist and not a dentistry student ( since my appointment is at the University of Dundee Dental hospital AND SCHOOL). ive tried giving myself a differential diagnosis as to why i am getting this bleeding gums ... and trying to exclude the obviously unrelated ones like anticoagulants and pregnancy-induced hormonal changes. it could be gingivitis .. arrghh .. hell no .. i hope not , tho' i think it might actually be ..oh well. im not the dentist. let the dentist make the Dx.ive got about an hr and a half left.d-uh.. was hoping to be seen right away when i went to register .. but no, sorry theyre too busy could i come back later? was hoping to go to the surgical wards in Ninewells and get more signatures for my Record of Achievement .. maybe will do that after i get the diagnosis from my dentist.   btw .. good old golliwog called this morning.. glad everything went okay. golliwog molliwog .. cant wait to see you after the exams ..
