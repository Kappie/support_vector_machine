       
       A constant dream   It still haunts me My thought train backtracks and lingers I am alone in a field and can feel the grass between my toes and the wind in my hair with the Fluttering of my sundress into space endless no trees no houses no flowers no one else just  me and grass and too bright sky, too bright day my hands twitter in nerves around my abdomen full with new life of myself and  someone                             Distant
