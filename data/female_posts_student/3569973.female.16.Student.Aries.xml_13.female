It also might have been because I was up until about 1 last night watching My Girl and working on something. Well today I have to go to the Candle Shop and I think Im gonna clean the house today. I cant wait until next weekend when I can finally paint my room. Its gonna be great!! All the old stuff is leaving and the new is coming in! lol. Just gotta wait until Jake is a little bit better...lol. Well I think I might get up in a minute and start cleaning the house and then take a shower. Till then, Later Days
