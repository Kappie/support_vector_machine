Feeling my eyes are conformed to the shape of the computer screen. Well...I am trying to put a project proposal to win the WATSON fellowship. It is actually call the Thomas J.Watson Traveling Fellowships, for any student who will complete degree their requirement for year 2004 and 2005. The purpose of this fellowship is give recipients "an opportunity for a focused and disciplined year of their own devising--a period in which they can have some surcease from the lockstep of prescribed educational and career patterns in order to explore with thoroughness a particular interest", so basically recipients get to go abroad to conduct their research. Isn't that cool? The fellowship continues "fellows have unusual,sustained, and demanding opportunity to take stock of themselves, to test their aspirations and abilities, to view their lives and American society in greater perspective, and, concomitantly, to develop a more informed sense of international concern." So really what they are seeking for, in specifics,  are cadidates who "demonstrate integrity, imagination, strong ethical character, intelligence, the capacity for vision and leadership, the promise of creative achievement and excellence within a chosen field, and the potential for humane and effective participation in the world community." The countries that a candidate picks must not be a country where that individual has spend growing up or been has had alot of first-hand experience. Must be foreign and new. The foundation will also not support projects involving countries that are under watch or unsafe to travel to. That's the brief of the felloship I am trying to apply for. oH yeah it is a nationwide fellowship, so if I do get selected by my college committee, then there will be the foundation's representative will be coming to interview during the school year. Doesn't this sound exciting?      My research project's topic is going to be on Youth and Technology, comparison of those within India and Japan. Concentrating on the specifics, I will be looking more into the communication technology within youth and how and why it is important to the generation of today and the future. Or is communication technology nowadays affecting Youth in a certain way that might evolve into something new and will take affect in society?      Take a look at Japan, youth culture has been one of the biggest influences in lots of businesses in Japan. Youth in Japan are the biggest consumers, "CONSUMERISM" that is the most crucial part of their national identity. For example,  Youth in japan cannot live without their cell phones, they use their cell phones to not only converse but also email and updates on their everyday life. And you know what, you guys be surprise, lots of youth do not even know how to operate a PC! Because there is no need to do so. Yeah, a country that's high in technology, famous in gizmos and gadgets.Go figure...       If you read news about India's economy, globalization is one of their key in improving its country's status and development.  But hey most of you guys know that India is not a rich country like Japan, a country that has no poverty to begin with. From what I've researched there are companies that are trying an outreach program to communities that are poor,such as places that has absolutely no running water, giving children a chance to be educated, that way they can change their lives for the better. As you can see, with this kind of help, it opens up opportunities for the poor. I've read in one of the articles online saying " In order for the rich to profit, the poor has to profit in order for the rich to stay rich,and there is no reverse". India's economy has been growing tremendously with the outsourcing of jobs. IT now becomes the important part of a youth's education.Young children as young as six are being introduced to computers. This creates a middleclass in the society which never really happen before in India. Also the high market of mobile phones comes from youth.      So my questions are these, they are not actually my final ones as I am still doing research and trying to read up on as many resources that I can find.       1. For Japan,How does communication technology influence youth culture of today?     2. How does communication technology helped propogate and define youth culture in Japan?     3. Does the current growing IT and communication tech help creating a youth culture in India?       What I am trying to do is to come up with a specific final topic to compare these two countries. Still in the process of building this project. From my observations so far, I don't see many articles been written much about how technology is influencing youth or how it is important to our today's young generation. And it would be great if I can get to research and experience this first hand.        That is all for now. So wish me luck and I will keep everyone posted as I go along. If anyone has any ideas to help me narrow this down, please feel free to post a comment.    tata....
