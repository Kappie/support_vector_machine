I was eating lunch yesterday with Mia, Rose, Lucia and Kacy when one of Alice's friends showed up. Her name is Kit, she really is nice and I'd love to be her friend but I always get the feeling that she thinks she's better then us. She invited me to a party she was having last night and then added "It's in a church, but don't worry! I won't try to convert you or anything, Angela!" This comment confused me for a few seconds, do I look like a Satan worshipper? How does she know I don't practice Christianity? I swear, I've never made a big deal out of my beliefs. I even look pretty normal right now, much more then I used to. The she leaned forward and whispered "I'd ask you to bring some of your friends... but I don't think any of them would be very welcome in a church." I nearly said "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!" but then I noticed Lucia was explaining her theory on what Gonzo from the Muppets actually did with that chicken in vivid detail. So I shut my mouth and just nodded. I was actually tempted to go, the party sounded like fun for what it was. But, other things came up so I didn't get to go. Oh well, what sort of party only runs til 10 PM anyway? Not any kind I've ever been to.   Everything else this weekend involved getting high with Mia. I love Mia, but the last one of her parties I went to involved me passing out in her basement. When I woke up I was lying on a futon with a half-naked girl I didn't even know. I think it was a confusing moment for both of us but we got over it and just went back to sleep until morning. I never did find out who she was but she was very nice. Anyway, I skipped that whole affair this weekend. You should only have to face things like that every once in a while.  I'm starting to REALLY worry about Steph. She hasn't been to school for weeks and we haven't been able to contact her. She's not even answering her cell phone and that's not like her at all. I hope she's ok, wherever she is...  I suspect that one of my bunnies, Ariel, is actually a fuzzy three-pound spawn of Satan. That little critter is evil to the core. Bloody cute, but evil. I had to go somewhere with my parental units this morning so I was trying to herd her back into the laundry room where she and my other bunny, Harvey, live. They have to stay down there when we leave because if they tramp around in the main house they'd set off the security alarm. Anyway, she was hiding under the guest bed and when I looked under it she lunged out and attacked my face. I'm not kidding, she went at it full force, I have a huge scratch running from the corner of my left eye to my mouth. God she's evil.  I have to go write an assload of essays right now. I'm such a procrastinator. Bye. :)
