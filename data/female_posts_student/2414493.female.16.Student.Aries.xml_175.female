He sparknoted it and launched a Jane Eyre sparknote back at me, something about wanting to fit in and finding a place. I wish I still had that quote, I'd laugh even harder. So that's what he thinks of me!  But he did bail me out at 2am. What a way to repay, Lydia.   I can't think of any other way to approach him than with cynicism. It's not the first time that I've initiated a friendly conversation with him and then turned edgy for no particular, distinguishable reason.  Well, at least I'm moving on to Faulkner. I opened Light In August and some pages tumbled out at me. What a sign.  And then I went to practice some. I think the prelude has new life, but the fugue just still sounds so elementary. But people like it? Or so I guess. Ah, but the Ravel. I can hear Mr. Francis singing in the background and waving his arms for dramatic effect. I can hear Nancy Bricard clapping and entreating me to pick up the tempo. It's really scary, but I like my ghosts around when I practice. I couldn't get much done with Ravel, though. It's the sloppiness issue still; there's just too many notes in too many awkward positions. I'll have to get up early to warm up tomorrow. No, I'll practice in earnest. I have a lesson at 11:15.  What else can I do tomorrow? SATII studying, but that doesn't sound attractive. Dad's going to be home, I just remembered.  I don't know if I should go on that AA field trip. I know Bruckner moved the video a day back just because of me (originally, the trip sounded so much more attractive because I'd miss the taping), and I don't know if it's even nice to show up Tuesday and tell her that I've changed my mind and that I'm going to show up on Wednesday. Who's going, I don't know. But not Nige, and not Nimo. Part of me wants to stick it out just because and see how I'll feel next year but then the other part asks myself why I want to go through that awkwardness. And I wouldn't want to miss the last day for the journalism seniors if we're not having dinner. We should. I'll talk to Mrs. Battaglia.
