Where's the snow? i'm living in a tropical country. we don't have snow here, teehee. but i'm dreaming that someday it will snow. we do have a cold weather. yet i don't quite like the monsoon season. storms are scary. okay, you get the drift.   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?  I usually celebrate Christmas with my family, loved ones, relatives and friends. we have this yearly family reunion. it's held at our grandparents' place/s, where there are lots of christmas goodies, foods and gifts; and where everybody is happy :)   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?  Nope!   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?  Yupp. i donate money and old stuff to the salvation army.   5. What one gift would you like for yourself?  LOVE and HAPPINESS :)
