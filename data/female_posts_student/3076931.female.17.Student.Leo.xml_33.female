Maybe it's just a phase. I'm not used to being bored. I'm one of those people who have to constantly be entertained, it's really hard for me to sit around and do nothing. Maybe when I start my internship tomorrow at the radio station that will spice up my life. HOPEFULLY. I need something to keep me occupied. I even gave in to a babysitting job...and I don't like kids all that well.My boss for my promoting jobat the radio station told me that most of his interns end up working at the radio station. So I thought that was pretty neat. We'll see tomorrow.   I found a Lexus IS300. It was beautiful. Slate gray and just oh so perfect. I need money. I need a job. I need that Lexus.   Oh, and I was right. All boys suck and they are all jerks.
