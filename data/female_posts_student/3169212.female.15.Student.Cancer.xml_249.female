No one really knows why they faint at random moments.  Kuronue:  (Back on the scene and looking...the same as he always did, but feelin' smooth)  *looks at Kurama*  Who the hell are you?  Kurama:  You should know.  Kuronue:  *stares at Kurama for a bit**cautiously*  Kurama...?  Kurama:  Indeed.  Kuronue:  You look different with red hair.  Baka:  *suddenly waking up from her spell**looks at Kurama, then Kuronue*  I see I have some explaining to do.  *the two other demons (excluding Inu-Yasha{no offense}) stare at Baka*
