I was going to go with Jim and Matthew and Diane and them, but I had the sectional...so, nope. Oh well. It's cool. I wanted to spend time with Kels and MC and stephen and all them before they leave this weekend.  I'm listening to this song that MC and Kels were telling me about and I love it. It's sad, but I really, really do like it.    There's a man Standing on the corner with a sign saying, "Will work for food" You know the man, you see him every morning The one you never give your money to You can sit there with your window rolled up Wonderin' when the light's gonna turn green Never knowin' what a couple more bucks in his pocket might mean  What if he's an angel Sent here from heaven And he's makin' certain that you're doin' your best to take the time To help one another Brother, are you gonna pass that test?  You can go on with your day to day Tryin' to forget what you saw in his face Knowing deep down, it could have been his saving grace What if he's an angel?  There's a man and there's a woman living right above you in apartment G There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling and it don't sound like harmony You can sit there with your tv turned up, while the words and his anger fly But come tomorrow when you saee her with her shades on, can you look her in the eye?  What if she's an angel Sent here from heaven And she's makin' certain that you're doin your best To take the time to help one another Brother, are you gonna pass that test? You can go on with your day to day Tryin' to forget what you saw in her face Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace What if she's an angel?  A little girl on daddy's lap Hidin' her disease with a baseball cap You can turn the channel, most people do But, what if you were sittin in her daddy's shoes?  Maybe she's an angel Sent here from heaven And she's makin certain that you're doin your best To take the time to help one another Brother, are you gonna pass that tes?  You can go on with your day to day Tryin' to forget what you saw in her face Knowing deep down, it could have been her saving grace  What if she's an angel?
