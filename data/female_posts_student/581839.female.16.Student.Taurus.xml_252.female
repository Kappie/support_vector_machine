So right now im like totally laughing at Annie for failing her eye exam! HAHAHAHA! So now we're gonna go make some macaroni and CHEESE.........  now that that is all done, i'll finish. so we're making macaroni and cheese now, and then we're going to find some stickers for my car. and then, i don't know what. will happen. cause life throws lots of curved balls. word yo. that was deep. like a pool. or an ocean.
