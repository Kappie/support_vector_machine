Russell quit hardee's so i dont have to face him as often with all the "rumors?" that are going around... hmm for all i know it could be the truth... and Chris had me in tears yet again the other night.... why is it all so damn unfair??? school is already a PITA and yeah... i just want to be done with it all.... i have had to fix like 4 people and hell, i cant even fix myself.... go figure.... and i have been dead tired.thought... sorry..... hence the random thoughts and dots....
