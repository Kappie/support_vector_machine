This just sucks...i was just not made for all this..I think its crap and u know what i am not going to cry over it! Its just a waste of my life and time to think over someone who happens to be a total "jerk" (dont know really that is the right word,but works for now). What do u do when someone doesnt feel the same about u? I thought it was a two way thing.... I know I think too hard, and this just drives me nuts....commitment is something I will never be able to do....esp to someone!!! Although as much as i love my independence I hate this lonely, emptiness feeling inside me...does this happen to you ever? or am I just thinking too much? I know this just doenst make sense at all....but right now my head is just not in the right place...i think i need to call it quits! arrggghhhhh.....
