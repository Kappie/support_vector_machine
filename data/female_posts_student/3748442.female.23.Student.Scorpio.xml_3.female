This made her feel better about everything crappy in her life.   Many people choose to kill living things when they get depressed. That girl in the book killed fish, the girl in  Monster  killed Johns, and me: I kill plants. Not intentionally, of course, but something happens to me when I get in a funk that makes me unable to water the unfortunate greenlife in my home. Right now there are only two plants who are suffering, and although I feel bad about, I just sit and stare at them and continue to let them wither and shrivel, knowing how thirsty they are and not doing anything about it.   So, this morning I forced myself to give them a little bit of water, because after years of off and on antidepression medication, I have finally learned how to control the funks on my own. And I'm going to buy a new pair of jeans today, even though I know I shouldn't really spend $59.99 plus tax at the Gap. Somehow I got it in my head that giving my hard earned and much needed earnings to a company whose clothes come from slave children overseas will make me feel better about myself.   And, yes, I suppose I lied about the blog break. Everything computer-related is intact the moment, but it won't be for long.
