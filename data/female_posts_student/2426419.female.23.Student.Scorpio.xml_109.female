(this should make you smile REAL big)   point finally made:  why isn't "i love you" a thoughtles phrase anywhere but in the family?  and isn't the church supposed to be closer than a family?  if love is the center node (thanks chad) of the web of christianity, then why don't we say it at all?  (well i suppose god is the center node, but isn't god love?  sorry, no more disclaimers, see what happens is i think way too far ahead to where people are criticizing (sp) some of my claims)  let's take a poll: would we rather see the saying "i love you" turn into a cliche because of over usage, or never be said at all?  again, i strive for authenticity, as does jacob's well.  i wish these other phrases listed would be more real.  it just doesn't make any sense for the church to be afraid to say "i love you" to someone, but even worse to not ever think it needs to be said, and that's what i believe we are guilty of.  we've just not been conditioned to overspeak it the way we have of "i'll be praying for you".  however our culture has conditioned us to be afraid of saying it at all.  i guess we'll see who the brave people are soon enough, i like you - and like meas love
