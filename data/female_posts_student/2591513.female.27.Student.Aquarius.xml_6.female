I am not going to stress about it anymore because I promised myself not to sweat the small stuff.  I just have to worry about getting the good grades so I can get the scholarships and then money for college won't be an issue right?  haha  So that is what the plan is anyway.  Bailey and Ed are pooped.  Bailey had the jogathon and Ed had Basketball tryouts.  I thought it was funny...They are both knocked out...Of course Ed has some liquor in his system, but it is the weekend right?  So they keep reminding me.  I feel bad, Emily is sick and I can't do anything for her because she only wants to go to my mom.
