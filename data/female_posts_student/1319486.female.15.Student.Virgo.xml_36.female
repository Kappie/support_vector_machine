(did you know that celli is the plural of cello?...anyways.) it's very sad. they're just so...mysterious and different. i don't know what's wrong with me. i like this guy and i don't even know his name. and i won't see him til next year b/c...well... just because. i am now sad. but i'm also relieved that i won't have to face him. that's my weird fetish. --this summer i really want to go to an atlanta braves game. it takes forever to drive there from my house, but i LOVE seeing baseball live. watching it on tv is boring. i mean who really cares what the pitcher's face looks like if you can't see the pitch. plus, its fun to just be there.  --rally rally, the pitcher's name is sally, hoo hoo-hoo hoo hoo. (i love it when you call me big poppa...) hardball is one of the best movies ever made. keanu reeves is really cute in most of it. g baby is the coolest little kid in that movie. i don't know what the actor's name is but he's cute too(considering it's the same person). the end is so sad i always cry. don't see the end if you don't love crying. --it's finally my spring break. the only class i don't have homework in is chemistry. that is because she likes our class to be one day behind the other classes. since we hav eit one day after they do. it makes sense in her head i promise. it's a lanni moment kind of like a hyatt moment. go stat! --i can't wait to get a journal. then i'll be able to stop publicly posting my thoughts on the internet. not that these are very personal, but that i can actually write the REAL things that go on in my mind. i've already picked out a journal that i want at barnes and noble. it's red. very pretty. i just need to earn $15 so i can go and buy it. my parents will never buy it for me. they'll buy me books sometimes, but usually only for school or in the summer when they don't like me being lazy. which i used to be, but not anymore. it's kind of sad to lose your laziness. of course you can always refer back to it when you need to. it's always there for you. that's comforting in itself i guess. things i miss i can always go back and do even though i'm getting older. wow i sound like i'm 40 or something. i'm not. not yet anyway. bye for now....       -stace-
