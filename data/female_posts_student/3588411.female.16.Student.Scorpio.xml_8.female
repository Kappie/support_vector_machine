I think it's safe to say I can scratch my eyes out now.Someone pray for Toni. She (meaning me)is stuck inthe house with an eleven year old who is um well ...eleven . (Oh and Jay if yur reading this she isn't fond of you because she didn't knowwhat STFU is.So if you could like um tell hr next time you decide to comment on me?) N.E ways back to my crappy day;yeah um... I found this web site for poetry. It's kind of like a blog but only for poetry and everything is copywrited under your username. Then I started watching music videos and um yeah it was crap. Today I think I died of bordum and went to Hell.
