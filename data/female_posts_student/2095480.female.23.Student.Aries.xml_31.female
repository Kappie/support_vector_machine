So today, I went to the CD store in the mall (FYI I think - I'll know for sure when the credit card statement comes in) and just browsed. What originally took me there was VNV Nation. I was hoping to find a CD of theirs. Its a long story, but basically I bought a mix CD in Austria in 2002, and one of the songs was by VNV Nation. After doing some research about them on the web, I decided to see if I could find a CD in the store - basically just to get a sound. The lyrics this band has are awesome - found on the one CD I do have; I quoted them in my last entry. Anyways, I found that VNV Nation is not findable - in Valdosta. Which, of course, led to general browsing of CDs. I was there, so why not look? I found a curious looking used CD for 7 bucks. The name:  VAST for (Visual Audio Sensory Theater) . The name alone beckoned for some research. Fortunately, the store allows for listening prior to buying, which is exactly what I did. I like the basic 'sound' so I decided to splurge the $7 and get it. Being the dork that I am, it was in the car player before I left the store.  I was soon to be amazed by what I had discovered by accident.   The song lyrics are basically from the point of view of hurt, lost, and confused characters.  Seems to me that any college student who has lived could have written them.  It was truely amazing.  Here are some quick examples:   every time that i cry out no one ever comes to me every time that i reach out no one ever rescues me i wish i could hide from every one is there somewhere else to be take me in i want out that's all i need i wish i could run from every thing   ~~~~~~~~   i cant tell where you lust ends and where your love begins I didnt want to hurt you baby I didnt want to hurt you   i really didn't love you baby i really didn't love you but i'm pretty when i lie you hurt me baby i hurt you i didn' want to hurt you baby [x4]   ~~~~~~~   The music itself is pretty awesome too.  Its tone reflects the lyrics. I particulary like the songs "Pretty When You Cry" and "You". So, of course, I hopped on the web, and low  behold, there is a whole series of CDs by this group... guess I need to go to work and earn some more dollars.   ~~~~~~~   My how the times have changed.   This Saturday night is the music dept. formal. Years ago, in high school in preparation for prom, I started months in advance. First, dress, then date, hair, makeup, dinner, transportation blah blah blah. I also wanted to "fit in". I had to have the cool style dress, the cool ride, the perfect date, perfect hair etc.  Lets see... I bought a very unique outfit for 20 bucks for this weekend, I know no one else will look like me... I'm going stag, my car, no "pre-dinner", I'm doing my own hair (which will be unique), and my own make-up. Grand total spent on this formal: $25 dollars. However, I think it will be awesome... I will be in top form, and I think many will be surprised by my look, but that's all I'm saying for now.  ~~~~~~~~  I really don't have anything more to say at the moment, I guess that can be a good thing. I mean, geesh, my last entry was a book. I did not direct that entry to any one person, but rather, it just reflected how I was feeling when I wrote it, which was definitely, "pissy". I do think I said some good things, all of which I still believe.    The Future...   something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.  ~~Clive Lewis (1898-1963)
