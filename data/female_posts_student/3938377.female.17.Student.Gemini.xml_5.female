At first I didn't want to do it, but it turned out to be pretty fun. The make-up artists were like the best I've seen. So I hope I get to work with them again.  So what's going on with me and Mike??? I really don't know, right know it's like stagnant, and like nothing is going on but, that might change. It frustrates me that I never get to see him. Whenever he's not working, I am really busy, and when he's busy, that's when I want to see him. And soon he'll be going to college and I'm still gonna still be stuck in Algonquin.  I like really have no life. For the simple fact that I am here writting in a weblog instead of talking to friends, that goes to show you how pretty lame I am. But hey... after a while you kinda get used to it.  Oh hell. I have to get ready to go back to school. NOOOOOOOOOO!!! I definately dislike that idea.   And so....
