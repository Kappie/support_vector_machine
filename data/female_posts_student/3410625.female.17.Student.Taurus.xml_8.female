"yani, saye tgk ur not ur usual self. awak bukan menari. drop all ur worries. concentrate on ur dance". ok. juz den, aida took my prop by accident. for some reason, i flared up like i nvr did. she, d other dancers n cikgu all stared at me for a moment. apologised to her after tht. dance class ended.  he sent me an sms. quarrelled again. shall not write wat he actuali wrote. i'd feel hurt again. for some reason, i broke down! dammit! nvr been like this before! hid it frm d others though. asked syaz for d remedy. 5 farkin sicks of it. dunno y n how i managed to consume so much. my average was like 3! wat d hell. reali lost myself. cldnt find anyone to talk to. turned to hardi instead. nvr felt any better though.  wat d fuck is wrong wif u, bitch?! this is wat YOU wanted, dammit! are u regrettin it now?! fuck it! get hold of urself! i cant! u've got wat u wanted, he's made his decision. n will no longer waste his time on a bitch like U..! am i regrettin it, NOW? i dunno. one thing i do noe though, after wat had happened to us.. after he's decided to forget me n move on.. realised how much i treasure him, how much he means to me and tht i cant lose him. since our first quarrel, keep having this feeling, this emptiness inside. oh well. doesnt matter now anyway. u stupid bitch, ur realising all these onli after he's decided to forget u. for wat?! will it change d situation, anyhow??! i noe. im juz farkin stupid i guess.  leaving for langkawi tmrw morng. dunno wen i'll be back. i'll take this time to reflect n see if i can award maself d "bitch of d yr" award. wat the hell. will miss him.
