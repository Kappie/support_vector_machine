I have to get over this and write a great proposal.   I want to graduate in May. In order to do that, I must write a proposal and start doing my research.   Also, I am always feeling that I'm behind, and this is ridiculous.  A year ago I wasn't even in graduate school. I am at the same point as many of my friends who have been in school for a year longer than I. I can do this!! I'm Nora!!!  I have talked to my informants several times this week- just chit chatty kind of stuff. One major informant is dreading going back to school, and is keeping busy with a GRE course, even though she doesn't know what she wants to get a masters (or phd) in. I love this girl- I will have to think of an alias for her. Anyway, she's so ambitious, and very capable- very intelligent- I'm sure she can do anything she wants. She is also one of the teachers who left a title one school this year- she still has title 1 students in her school, and she says that she moved because it was closer to her house. I'll have to ask her about that a little more.
