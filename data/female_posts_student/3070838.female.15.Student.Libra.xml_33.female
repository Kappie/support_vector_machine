Anyway. I played tennis for like 2 hours with my dad. We took a break, and then went back and played more. FUN NESS. lol. We just messed around for the first two hours, then we went to the Tote and I had Sprite lol. Then we came back and played one set. And I w-o-n 6-4. Oh yah. That was so much fun. However, it was hard to concentrate with the track meet going on around us lol.  Well I'll TTYL, I'm so bored. l8az ~*EPT*~
