I hate xanga! To the blogger people: I love you. Blogger is 10 times better than xanga.   Ok, other than that.  I went outside into the bright sunshine yesterday. It was.. relaxing. I got away from the computer screen for at least 4 hours, which is a miracle of no small proportions. Going outside was a bit inconvienent, seeing as I was having my first burst of creative design since... o, three months ago. That's all right though, I needed to work on a tan anyways.    And now it's time for a "secret" update   Secret Number 1: It's only 2 weeks and 3 days away! Ya'll are going to be sooo surprised.   Secret Number 2: So, I haven't quite talked to mystery man, but, maybe I'll get too sometime soon. Secret Number 3: Muahahahaha you'll never find out who my next year's Prom date is. I have only told.. 2 ppl. muahahaha.   Heehummhoo  Anyways, like I said earlier, I was working on a new blogskin last night. It's pretty spiffy. It's called Technicolor Grunge. Weird name? Yea, but it's a really awesome skin. I was just messing around with gradients and spikes and stuff so I decided to just make a skin. It shall be revealed either today or tomorrow so look for it on Blogskins or my design site.   I leave you with this... can a chicken cross a road?
