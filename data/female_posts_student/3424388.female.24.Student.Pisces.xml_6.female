Say, how is it that Madeline Albright has managed to look exactly the same for more than ten years?       I'm very tempted to call into C-Span and ask them why they haven't talked with any of the DNC bloggers (here are two related sites:  urlLink ConventionBloggers.com  and  urlLink CyberJournalist.net )   or at least I haven't seen blog coverage from C-Span. Will there ever be a day when C-Span links us to the blogs of politicos? It seems worthy of at least a mention, right? Or do they think that bloggers are threatening their turf?     Some bloggers are distressed by big media congloms entering the blogosphere.  I say it's a free world  . I understand that this breed of handsomely paid, media-celebs-cum-bloggers are stealing the thunder of bloggers. Yes, the very essence of blogging is having an independent voice, a voice outside the banalities and slantedness of established media outlets, but there's room for all kinds of bloggers.  There are 120 bloggers with credentials at the DNC.   There's even a  urlLink blogger  covering all the blogging.       CNN   is blogging the DNC.  Greta Van Susteren at  urlLink Fox  is also blogging.
