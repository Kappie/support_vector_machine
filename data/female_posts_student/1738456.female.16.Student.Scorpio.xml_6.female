I knew I had to go somewhere, and do something, but I didn’t know what it was I was supposed to be doing.  The keys to my car were glowing faintly on my desk, so I figured I might as well try and drive to wherever it was I was supposed to go. I reached out for my keys, and just as I got close enough to grab them, they slid onto the floor. I ignored the fact that nothing was there to make them fall, and bent down to pick them up. This time, they rolled across the room.  “Okay, what the hell is this?” I said to them. They didn’t respond to me, although I did hear the faint sound of laughter coming from their direction. My parents hadn’t left their cars at home, so I needed to get these keys, and I wasn’t planning on chasing them down the hallway.  “Come here,” I demanded hoping against all hope that they would hop into my hands. No such luck, they scooted out my door. I sighed, and leaned against the wall.  Okay , I thought, I  just need to breathe and walk quietly out my door and grab the keys.  So I counted to ten, and walked sideways out of my room, my back pressed against the wall. Silently, I lowered myself to the floor. With one swift move, I snatched up my keys.  “Yes!” I shouted pumping my fists in the air, and then something bit me. Then again, and once more as hard as something could possibly bite me.   “Fuck!” I screamed, and dropped the keys. I held my hand in the other and stared down at it. There were three sharp incisions where it looked as if the keys had dug themselves deep into my skin. “What the hell am I supposed to do now?” I screamed at the ceiling. My keys snickered, and rolled off the edge of my balcony. I wasn’t planning on picking them up again, so I figured I might as well walk. I headed down the stairs, and straight for the door.
