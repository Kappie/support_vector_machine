That is the best new drink at Starbucks right now.  (Yea, I've had Starbucks twice in two days, what are yea gunna do.)  So my parents are in Regina right now.  Thus all the money spending.  They figured I'd die without money to spend while they were away, and they're probably right!  Anywhoo, that's my recap of my week.  Mummy and Daddy are home on Monday night.  Or Tomorrow even.... anyhoo, that's the story, tootles kiddies!
