And when he says he's kidding you know he's not. And you can get ice cream all over your hands and he takes your hand and holds it anyway. And you can stand outside the ice cream place kissing him and feeling loved even if its only in that stupid high school way. I think you should have someone like that... not just someone but  that  someone." -Emily  "Happy Birthday!" -Andrew  "Where two or more are gathered in my name, i am there also" Matthew 18:20  ...various "head movies"...daydreams... of going out with Andrew... of listening to a heartbeat... of kissing in the rain... of lying in a hammock with Andrew... of going to winfield with Emily... of...celebrating (for lack of a better word) Christmas with Emily... of "winning"... of hugging the life out of Emily to stop life from taking her... of...my future friendships and relationships in so many different ways...  im glorifying love again. this is why im such a crazy bastard.
