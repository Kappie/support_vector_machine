Meaning my three months of hard core studying were a bit of a waste.  This is what happens when a new person in the department makes the exam.  Sigh. Then we went out to a bar, where I discovered a department-wide conspiracy to get me wasted.  I was doing fine sticking with rum and cokes (it takes a LOT of rum to get me drunk), but was bullied into doing vodka shots.  However, general opinion states that it was not the vodka that did me in, but was in fact my last rum and coke, which was given to me in a large glass (like a tumbler that you would get water in at a normal restaurant), and was actually 85% rum.  But no one mentioned that to me, hence the conspiracy. So I puked.  A lot. Gross, really.  It would have been more fun if I could have just been tipsy or what not and not vomiting.  But now the archaeology peeps can leave me alone now that they finally succeeded in their two year quest to get me wasted.  I guess after I went home things got a little crazy and there was a four way kiss (two girls and two guys) among other things.  Would have been amusing. At least I was mostly spared the hangover.  I felt better after about 10 this morning.  And was mostly functional the rest of the day.  I was the only one in my cohort to make it to the ling lecture, tho.   Okay, have to get back to working on the history paper.  Wheee, fun.
