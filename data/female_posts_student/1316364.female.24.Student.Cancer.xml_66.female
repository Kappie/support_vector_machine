I felt my project was a hit, now the tough part waiting for the grades to get posted. I am sure I did fine but I still can’t help but worry about how I did.  Well in a few days we should know.   I have to pass both classes because if I don’t I will be fired from work. I am on probation through my employer and even though being fired due to academic standings is silly, it still means being fired and I have never been fired from   any   job I have ever had.  Other than that, I am doing quite well. I am going to get to see Jesse and mines friend Ronnie for the first time in forever, but in two weeks. I can’t wait. It will be so good to be able to see him again. I have missed him. Remember he was the one who was stationed in Korea and finally came home a few weeks back.   I am also looking forward to summer break which will give me a chance to save up some money and work on becoming Debt free. Yippy. Then back to school again. I am looking forward to going back too. I am 3 units away from completing my Associate Degree in Fine Arts and Jesse might actually be able to be home for my Graduation Ceremony which is what I want the most, for him to be in the crowd cheering me on when I get my degree.  I so can’t believe how wonderful things have been turning out given the circumstances.  It sure is funny how life works sometimes.
