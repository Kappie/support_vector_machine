I won't have access to a computer during this time, so my plan is to make a bradford journal, where i will document all the horrors i see, plus i'll probably add some amusing drawings. I will add a page or something to my blog where you can read it, and pity me. Maybe i'll just have a little log off to the side for whenever i don't have access to blogger. good god someone help me. i don't want to spend six days at wallmart! oh god.... six days.... god save me...
