They think that somehow, by telling others what they're doing wrong or how their actions are viewed that they're doing some miraculous act. These people, need to die. I'm serious. There is no room on this planet for people who think so narrow mindedly. Some specific people come to mind but they shall remain nameless. But if you think that you are one of these people or that you may do this sometimes, then I'm talking about you.
