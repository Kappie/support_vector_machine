I was at buckle today (the mall is an interesting place.)  and this worker guy siad "I like your shoes, are they comfy? and I said "very comfy!" and he goes "Solid!"  and I was like Okkkkaaayyy..  Is solid the new word? does it replace "tight" and "cool"? I hope so, just saying solid makes me happy.   Solid Solid Solid
