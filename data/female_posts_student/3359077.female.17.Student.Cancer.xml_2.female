I already asked 2 of the people who keep their horses there if they fed Taffy or borrowed some hay or something. No, they hadn't. I know for a fact they didn't. That only leaves one person. Deanna.  I hate to say that, cause she's my friend and all, but I think it's true. I really hope it isn't.  Another friend problem: Katie.  Yes, her name's the same as mine. Anyways, at the beginning of the year a new girl moved into town from Alaska. Her name's Heather. The three of us were all friends, but then I went to Arizona last February for a week and when I came back things were much different. Things had been changing before I left, but the changes had gotten worse. First, Katie went to the Valentine's Day Dance. She would never go to a dance, no matter how much I begged her, but Heather talked her into it. Second, she no longer ate lunch with Natalie and I, she ate with Heather's friends. I tried to eat with them for two or three days, but it was obvious that I was one person too many. Then Prom came. I was gonna go, but nobody seems to want to ask me out, so I didn't go. Katie went, though. Afterwards, she got drunk, stripped in front of 4 guys, and possibly had sex with one of them.   I have opinions on everything. Katie knows that, she also knows I don't like what she did. I know she's ashamed or embarrassed about what she did. I know because of the way she looks at me when Heather or somebody starts talking about their little "after prom party". It really pisses me off. Excuse my language. She needs to get her life figured out or she's gonna end up like her mom; pregnant in high school, low paying job, etc. I want our friendship to end. I don't want to watch her ruining her life anymore. I don't want to be the one who fixes everything and makes it better. Oh wait, she has Heather to do that, at least in the dating area. All Katie needs me for is to do her homework, which I refuse to help her with. You know, I'm tired of being her shadow. I'm tired of people asking who I am, and when I say "Katie.", they respond with "Katie Rose?". Guys seem to think she's beautiful, and she really is. As far as I know nobody thinks of me as beautiful. I've always been kinda pretty or just cute. Man, I sound like I'm jealous. I guess I am. My life seems to be crumbling. It's like a mid-life crises at 16.  Oh well. Such is life!
