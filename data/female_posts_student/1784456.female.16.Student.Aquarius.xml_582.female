Geez, my mum's gone to her friend's house and our house has been thrown into chaos. It's covered in yogurt pots! Eeeek! And kind of smells like... strawberrys...? Wierd, definatly! Hey peeps where is every one? Oook, so my dad and brother are up, good, good. Nope, not good, I'm getting thrown off. :( :( :( Bisi.
