It was all kind of musical bible stories which, unfortunately and honestly, I've never heard before. So they were interesting.  I think I'm going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today which should be amazing. I'm gonna take Michael Moore's advice and sneak in. (It's rated R but he said if you're a teenager and you haven't figured out how to sneak into a rated R movie, you've got some problems!)
