It is bitter because there are finals that can totally trash your entire grade! What?!? Anyways I am not wasting my  summer.  I will be behind the wheel!  Love is in the air.......NOT!  Maybe this year we will run those runs at 5 in the morning haha! WEll I think I need to leave cuz i am wasting my summer!!!!! I am going to try to eat noodles actually cuz my teeth hurt soooo bad!
