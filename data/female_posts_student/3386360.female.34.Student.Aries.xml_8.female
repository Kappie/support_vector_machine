Holding that little angelic baby in my arms washed away all the pain from the past. Not my child, the child of my sister he still held my heart. I watched him grow and protected him with my life. I would spend hours upon hours watching him, listening to him. laughing and loving him. As time went on and I had a family of my own I still had a special space in my heart for the baby that thawed my abused heart. When I moved he was all that I would honestly miss aside from my mother but I knew in my heart my mother would follow me. I knew that I would never see my beloved nefew again. I told my sister he would not live to be in his mid 20's. I told her to keep him from motorcycles if she wanted to see her son alive. She thought I was joking. I left the state and never saw him again. That was 1994 10 years ago. This was the child that tore down all the walls, he was at one point in time the one who kept me alive.    I found out last night at age 22 he was hit and killed by a train while riding his motorcycle. I'm not sure of all the details. I am to say the least estranged from my family.. I'm numb. My heart is ice again.
