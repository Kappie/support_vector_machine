She's like "yeah this girl cam up to me and was like let's have sex but i was all i don't flow that way" and then like a few weeks later she's like "i make out with girls for fun" and then she's like "i'm in love with paras (i.e. some girl) she gave me a hickey, my parents didn't flip. I love you paras!" it's intense. It's like a really shitty student film, in blog format.  urlLink Moe's Blog
