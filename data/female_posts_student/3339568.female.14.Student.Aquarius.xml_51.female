Firstly, on the way we were in the car with Ted and we were doing karaoke to...Britney Spears "Oops I Did It Again" Hehe, it was quite hilarious. Once we got to the restaurant, we were seated upstairs in a REALLY big long table, so I only got to see half of mi group that night, but there was this really phsyco guy there who verbally abused us! We were "being too loud" and he turned around and started a string of swear words, which mainly consisted of "fuckin kids...damn...fuck...kids...loud...fuckin hell..." and an array of equally colourful language, that the whole restaurant heard, and the man on the opposte table politley pointed out that "i  think  the man is trying to say your being too loud", and the service was soo bad, the waiters treated us like we weren't even customers, slamming the food down on the table and being generally rude, and the food wasn't that great either, so I'm definatley not coming back there again!  But after dinner (of which mainly consisted 4 me of 1 slice of pizza and a scoop of pasta, I was  starved ) we went back to Gemma's house 4 the sleepova, and we watched Phone Booth, which I've seen about 10 times, but it's still good, and then we watched a Viva-La-Bam marathon, which was really funny! This guy, his name is Bam right, and he got 4 truckloads of xmas lights and put them on his house, and made the whole of the insisde of his house an ice skating rink by putting this special layer of ice down, and then he got fake snow, like HEAPS of fake snow and sprayed it all outside, so it was like it was snowing, and then he got all these trucks and drove around and stuff, he was truly physco. He was a guy who was on Jackass once, so i think that explains it!  The next day,  urlLink Mel  had to leave early 4 Sunday School, but the rest of us hung around and watched Silence of The Lambs, which was my second time I'd seen it, and it definatley wasn't as scary as every1 made it out 2 be, like I love a scary movie, but this 1 was  not!    And then  urlLink Hannah W  and Gem and I went 2 Chatty 2 go shopping. We ended up getting Boost, but we got an extra 1 because of this free deal thingo, and Hannah left it in Valley Girl! And she came back 2 get it later and it was gone!   I wonder where that Boost it now...   And I bought a jumper in Valley Girl and a necklace in Diva. Excellent... But bi this time I was getting really tired, and all the extra energy I gained from sleeping in on Sat. morning left. Mum was late picking us up, so I had to drop off Han and Gem, then rush home, pick up dance pants, and rush off to Church Dance.  Dance was realli fun bi the way, 'cept I felt a bit behind everyone, but obviously I would be because it was mi first week, but I think I've pretty much got the chorus good, 'cept the rest of it I'm a bit rusty. Ahh, well I'll pick it up. It was realli fun tho!! :D And then I went 2 Ernie afta that, so bi this time I am sooooo exhausted, and I met  urlLink Jo  Yay 4 Jo! I was going on in her blog about how she didn't know me and how Church circles aren't welcoming and how I don't know half the people at Church and stuff, so she's like "Hey, I'm Jo, you posted on mi blog, now I know you!!" and yeh...it was cool...Jo's nice (hey Jo if ur reading!)  But neway, Church was cool, but I felt real bad, because I was practically falling asleep during Phil's (i think it was Phil, i dunno i was half-asleep) sermon. And i was sitting with mi knees 2 mi chest, resting mi head on 1 knee, and then Gem got her scarf and rolled it up and put it on mi knee 4 mi head 2 lie on and I'm like "Nooooo.....I must stay awake, if u do that I'm gonna fall asleep!" I think I ended up staying awake the whole time...but I sooooo didn't absorb  any  of it! Ahhh...meh  Neway, I had a pretty big weekend, and I pretty much passed out wen I got home, after I struggled through the rest of mi Maths h/w and attempted to clean mi "pigsty of a room" as mi Mum so nicley put it.
