This one makes number four...Not counting the indoor one that I did at hart house. It was in Belwood Lake, near Fergus, ON. The plan was to do this one for the swim only. As I felt that I needed the practice in race swim conditions..All the thrashing bodies and such. And that this one would also be a good warm up to the Olympic tri that I am doing Aug 22 in Brockville as the swim for this race was 1km (bike was 33km, run 7km). I was not planning on pushing hard on the bike and swim at all. WELL, I don't know what it was but I had an awesome race. I hit the water...Thank goodness I had the wetsuit the air was freezing and it looked like rain the few (5% of all athletes) with out wetsuit were shivering like mad while the rest of us were warm and cozy in our rubber wrappings. It was a fairly large and competitive wave (I was in the first wave...Which was weird normally I'm in the 3 wave or later). They had combined everyone under 30 plus the pro's in the wave I was in. As soon as the gun went off and I was in the water I don't know how to describe it but I was just ON. 20 min later (official time says two more minutes because it was a LONG way to the transition zone) I was out of the water. I think that I was SO psyched from having an awesome swim that everything else just went really well too. I placed (in my age category 16th!!! Which I am totally stoked about! My bike leg I was 12th!!!! That is the closest I have ever been and probably ever will be to top ten! Of course I need to qualify by saying that there were only 26 in my category...But still.
