And I wasn't allowed to bark very much, even though I just wanted to protect my family and our campsite.  We slept in a tent, which reminded me of my "house" at home, but people slept with me in there, too.  The camp fire was very hot, so I couldn't get too close to it, even though I really wanted to stick my nose in it to see what it was all about.  Then the next day, we went for a 7-mile hike.  I ran around so much that I probably ran at least 10 miles when we were done.  I went swimming in Nolan Lake at lunch and chased pikas and squirrels.  Today I was so tired that all I did was sleep all day.  Love, Caesar
