(soooo sorry sweetie!) and tomorrow is friday, this has been the SHORTEST week of my life. it flew by. not fair. yet was preceeded by the LONGEST week i have or will EVER experience. it was torture.  the down side of sitting at home sick ( heh, other than being sick, which wasn't have bad being drugged up) is that you have ALOT of time to sit, and think, and most of all. WATCH ALOT OF MOVIES. movies where everything works out. where everything happens to wind up perfect.  the movie 16 candels....ya, my birthday is next wednesday. all that has to happen, is everyone else forgets about my birthday, the hero comes and tho she thinks he doesn't even know she exists, he is watching her, and trying ot find a way to talk to her. and then he gives her her birthday wish. cha, right. fuck that. thats why i hate sitting alone thinking. i've thought about firstly, whats the point, why? who cares? why should he care still and then it slipped off the deep end. and i ACTUALLY start thinking why not? and that it could happen. i'm sick of thinking about it! sounding so superficial. i am. maybe thats the point.  I'm scared that i really hold nothing in my life. i mean go to school, and i basically know who its all going to go down to the fact that miko's hair is again going to be a different shade of blue this week, and that those ppl will be wearing that same old thing. and that girl still hasn't figured out how to do her hair to that it doesnt; look like a  grizzly bear's with a perm. the monotony makes me sick. but, the things that actually matter to me, like freinds, maybe it doesn't really mean as much to the other ppl. my freinds are what makes my life, but i get scared that they dont see it the same. i dont mean as much to them. and that scares me. and i put up a defensive wall, just so that if its true, i wont get hurt again. so then they think i'm being distant, and cold. its a vicious cycle. and i annoy everyone w. it. so i'll just shut up. and get on with my life right?....of course right....  "You cant just sit alone on your ass whining that your life is shit and you are headed no where. You have to get up, do something for a change, and if its truely got your heart behind, then you wont fail. wheres the loss in that. so now get up, and go get started."
