Everything's so predictable. Rong xin got the main role, but nathania also got a main role too and she was good. Superb. Amy can sing so well!!!  Then Tiffe likes Jonathan! The whole chinese lesson i disturb her like xiao and the best part is she never says no when i say it's so obvious tt she likes him lor. Even went to musical TOGETHER and snyo concert juz to watch him play. So romantic. Lol. Their sweet love never fails to remind me wat i used to have....sigh.  Today J.n and I practised for the first time and it was so not together lor. But in the end it was ok larh. He ar, dunno how to count properly one. Thank goodness it wasnt as awkward but he so ego one...claims he did all the talking. Bleh...aiyar dun care wat he says. But we definitely need to practise some more. LoL...when mrs chan saw us together she was quite shocked. "how did u all know each other?" LoL...aiyar...onli pri. sch. frens wat...then later she said "so cute". erm...  Ok...i think tt's about it today...then stoopid hansware cannot install but i'm glad internet can finally work!! yay!!
