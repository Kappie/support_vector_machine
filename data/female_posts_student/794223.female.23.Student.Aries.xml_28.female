My arm still really hurts, I've been nauseous all day, and generally felt rather blah.  The exciting news is that I finally ordered my cap, gown, and invitations for graduation. It's finally happening...can't believe it. I just need to take one more test for Oceanography at ACC, write about 10 more pages for the thesis over Thanksgiving, and I'm DONE. It won't fully hit me until December 5th, I'm sure.  Then the ironic thing is that 5 days after I graduate, I have to take a final. Ha! Stupid, rediculous graduation dates.
