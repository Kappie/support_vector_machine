And one of the jokes that he made has had me thinking ever since.  The joke was about girls getting pissed when they are called whores because of the way they are dressed.  The punchline was that well if a guy is dressed up as a cop, on the side of the street most people would, I presume, guess that the guy actually IS a cop.  This is so very prevalent in Iowa City.  Not so much now because school is out of session, but give it a few weeks when the underagers and those who still lack the courage to dress with elegance instead of wearing clothes the size of band aides return to the downtown scene.  Women everywhere are dressing with less and less.  And at the same time they complain that they are treated as a piece of meat when they are out at clubs.  Yes, it is nice to be looked at by the opposite sex (or whichever sex you are attracted to).  But I feel, and always have felt, that it is far better to be looked at with interest than with lust.  Perhaps this is why I'm so sick of the bar scene here in IC.  Too many retarded boys that think more with what's in their jock strap than in that lump three feet above their ass.  It really makes me wonder how the human race manages to reproduce so well when so many men think like this.  But then again, the women do not help the situation.  They shop at stores where the clothes are made out of material thinner than cheesecloth.  And the hemlines are so short that a girl cannot bend over to pick something up off the floor without showing more than she should.   I say "they" because I know women who do not aspire to look nor act like this, and that group includes myself.  (I also recognize that there are men, however small in number, do think more with their head and their heart than with their penis.)  Until a year or so ago, I would have changed so much about my body.  Bigger chest, flatter abs, smaller caboose, and slimmer thighs.  Now, I've learned to embrace my curves.  I am trying to eat better and once I get my financial aid refund check from the university, I'll be joining a local gym.  But I do not want to change almost everything, in fact the only thing I'd even remotely consider now would be getting a bigger chest.  I digress but basically all I want is to have a more healthy lifestyle.  I just wish for the return of the days when women like Marilyn Monroe were what defined sexy, sensual, and beautiful.  Marilyn Monroe was around a size 14 and today that's only good enough to be considered plus size.  Marilyn exudes classic and timeless beauty.  For crying out loud she is the epitomy of a pin-up girl.  She was sexy, but she wasn't looked at as a dime-bag whore working the streets.
