Third period rolled around, and Mr. O'Grady was picking on me, as usual. We talked about social security and how our generation is going to get NOTHING. I asked Mr. O'Grady if he would vote to have us put into social security, knowing full well we'd get nothing, and he was like "I like you, but I like myself more. So when I vote, I'll be thinking of Allison." O'GRADY DAMN YOU ! Then I was following Elizabeth and Jo Bo Jo to see Jiggle (if you don't know Jiggle, I spit on you! Come on guys, the amazing vending machine! Remember Troilus' boobs were jiggling!)Anyways, when we were walking back into the dining room, these middle schoolers practically pushed me into a table, so I shouted out, "Hey middle schoolers! Learn to get out of my way!" That was nice. Then Chemistry class. Well for those unies out there, you know that the robotics team came into contact with a stomach virus and were all messed up on their trip. This included, everybody's favorite, Doc. IMAGINE HIM THROWING UP, "BLAAAAEEEEEEEEBLAAAEEE". But in reality, EC said it sounded really low, gross. I apologize. So our sub is Dr. Nzg.. I don't know. But he was really cool. He was from the Congo and spoke about a thousand languages. Then Sam says, "so what were the houses made of?" I turned to EC and said, "Jesus, why doesn't she just ask him if he wears paint and dances around a fire?" OH SAM! I visited Dr. Doden during my fifth period study hall. We talked about me being stupid, it was fun. But first I had to drag him from Pryor's room and he was being mean to me, and I was like "Hey! I have dirt on you, but I can't say it cause I'll get in trouble." I really need to learn how to defend myself. I ran into Ann and she said my blog was Shameem quality. It was really nice, but untrue. Shameem is the blogmaster. She will always be number one. Plus, she's full Indian, unlike my half, therefore she's Indianastically good at everything. I made that word up, just so you know. It's like in "Never Been Kissed" when they make up the word "rufus" and everybody starts saying it. Well I better hear the word "Indianastically" tomorrow at school. In Spanish we talked about "Las Medias Rojas" ("The Red Socks") and how Ildara's dad thought she was a prostitute. EC, who was in robotics when we talked about it, didn't pick that up, and I was like, "EC, come on her hair and those seductive red socks" yeah I don't know, it was funny. BUT THEN! THIS IS SOOOOO EMBARRASSING, so naturally I will share it with all of you (and by that I mean like my 3 viewers, what up Liz Dawg). We broke up into small groups, mine was myself, Erica, EC, and Christina. Erica asked what to do about split ends. I suggested getting a hair cut, but she said she had them at the top of her head. We all concluded she would then need to shave her head. I said, "you would be bald, like my dream ass!" AHH See, because I am indian, I am very hairy, so naturally I tell everybody I have a hairy butt, well EC was grossed out and Christina just stared at me blankly. Nice times, nice times. We had cookies for lunch, yummm. At activites we looked at pictures of dogs. I know, thrilling. Then I went to AP Spanish. I'm taking the test- May 4, 8 am. Wish me luck. But we did these exercises where this tape mutters off a question, and you have twenty seconds to answer. It is really difficult, because I mean who can understand the question and then answer in 20 seconds?! Not me, that's fo sho. Well EC was taking a turn, and she kept rushing her answer and missing the beep. So after like the fifth time missing the beep, she shouts out "GOD DAMNIT!" ahh Pryor is a fool. Then we talked about boy bands, and he goes, "I wish there were more girls in Britney Spears" first of all she's not a band/talented. and I told Talia that "he wants to see more naked girls" and he goes "that's not what i said?!" EWW PRYOR DIE. Then I had eighth free, and I did my math homework.  I walked to my car with Eri, and that was fun. Then I sat in Ariel's car for like a half an hour and listened to Something Corporate, cause she's a loser who likes Hillary Duff- boo I know. I told her all about my favorite concert times. Calling William pretty, sneaking onto the SoCo bus, etc. Then we drove home, and we were side by side, and all of a sudden it starts to snow! We were both looking at each other dazed and confused.  I came home and played with our new cheese grader. It was fun, and I ate a lot of cheese. Then I channel surfed, instead of being productive. I saw Tom Cruise talking to Oprah, and my blood was boiling! HOW COULD THAT LITTLE SHORT UGLY MAN DIVORCE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD?! Eww he should be shot. And he was  all, "she's blazzing right now..." EWW I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR OSCAR SHIT FACE. I just hate him. And then I watched Room Raiders, it was really one of the best ones. This guy kept talking about him needing to be in a boy band, and that he was Justin Timberlake. He also drove a car, that on the hood said, "Playboy 1". Oh god! The girls were, I know this is mean, but they were really hit. The first girl was the bisexual, as she said "bad jewish girl" with piercings everywhere. Then there was an obnoxious cheerleader. And finally, this homely little girl who said, "I get straight A's. If I don't, I'll die!" THIS ALL CREATED A VERY EVENTFUL SHOW!  He ended up picking the cheerleader, OF COURSE. He was like, "I picked you because you tried out for "American Idol" and you're into actressing". Right, that's a word. Oh and his room was COVERED with pictures of naked girls. He had playboy cubic zirconium earrings, why? It was fun.  My mom came home and gave canned food to all the animal. Always a bad idea. Snickers goes crazy and likes writhes from pain, I don't know he should die.  I have to clean my room. It literally is messy. I counted 12 water bottles. And my carpet, is an unknown color anymore. The dirt is so thick that I can feel it in my toes.  This funny thing happend at the play on Friday. I asked Dr. Doden if we could meet on Monday fifth period, and he goes, "No. Cause I don't like you, you're too short." AHH my dream response was, "you're too hairy!" Though, I'm not one to talk. MEGAN QUINN TOOK DR. DODEN'S PICTURE ON MY CAMERA TODAY, IT WAS AWESOME.  Well, I should do homework bye!
