Talking to Nima on MSN. We were supposed to all work on the dance today at the school park but we ended up goofing off... as usual. Had our hopelessly hilarious moments, our serious moments, our goofing off moments, everything. Ioana and I walked to my house and we stayed outside on my driveway and talked. The usual. About... stuff. Like I said, with Ioana, everything is total honesty. I swear, I think I can talk to Moca all day long and we'd be laughing non-stop. I make a fool of myself for her amusement and she does the same. Hilarious.  Talked to my mom about Nima over dinner and yeah. It was funny. Dad was thinking about coming back to Canada for a week or two just for my grad and I asked what he'd do if he saw Nima and I hug but yeah. He'd probably just say: "Don't you see me standing here?! Hello???" So yeah. He wouldn't have a huge problem with it though.  Hmm, I think we might be going back to HK for the summer (maybe 1 month?) after all. Gotta update our HK ID cards. So yeah. I'll probably buy a really nice blade for cheaper in HK 'cos HK stuff is a lot cheaper than in Canada. Mehe! (no, thats not a typo... I just laugh like that)  Had Sunday worship today and Herman was talking about Singleness: A Whole in One. Very interesting. Made me think. As usual.  Bleh. Got an email from Star Miser. I forgot who that was. Sounds familiar though. Meh, whatever.  Hmm, a lot of stuff made me think today. Voluntary or mandatory? I will never know. Only Moca will know what I'm talking about... but she won't know unless I remind her. Haha. Me and my weirdo codes.   *laughs silently* LAUGHING RETARD  Roofles! So funny! "Are you done yet?" *STOPs laughing, DROPs on the floor, AND ROLLs on cola-covered floor laughing* THE STOP, DROP  ROLL drill! Roofles! That's what Moca did today.  We SO need practise for the contest. 'Cos the people that were in the Chinese one were good. HOWEVER, Moca sings better than all of them. Seriously. They sucked crap when it came to singing. Moca owns.  Nima wants to go to Wonderland again this coming weekend. Sure, why not? Just depends which day so that I know which day I can go golfing. Mehe~! I need a new golf glove (yes, you only play with one glove) 'cos it got too small for me. Same with my golf shoes... come to think of it, I outgrew all my golf stuff... except for my clubs and bag. Damn, I've got a cool bag! Hehe! Costed quite a bit. ^^ It's got a stand, straps for both shoulders, etc etc etc! Muahahaha! My bag owns! :D Whoohoo~  Roofles. I think I scared Nima. I said something jokingly and he didn't reply for a little bit. Okay he just said "lol". Oookay I officially scared him. Haha. Some people appreciate my twisted sense of humor, some don't, and some just live with it. Iunno. Haha. Weird. Only my GM Crew fully appreciate my twisted sense of humor that somehow makes sense! Gotta run.
