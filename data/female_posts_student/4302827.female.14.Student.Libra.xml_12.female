I read over Hannah's post, and was shocked at the similarities between people whom we hate. I have another one to add to my list though: the druggie/alcoholic/woo yeah party people. In my opinion, parties are pointless. Not birthday parties of course, but PARTY parties. Yeah dude let's go get drunk and have sex. What the hell? How much more useless can it get. You can do that within the safety of your own home. Ryan is so lucky. But he said people always ask him "Hey what about parties? How are you going to go to those?". Dear Lord, what a world we live in if the highlight of people's lives is to get drunk.  Haha! I just read in the newspaper (yes, the newspaper) about how people are changing their opinions on George Bush's decision to bomb the shit out of Iraq. Ha! Take that stupid moron! Your people don't love you anymore! I don't see how they ever did, but I guess sometimes Americans can be blinded by their own niavete. Niavette? Spelling?  The classes I am actually looking forward to are Humanities and VisCom. That's about it. Some others might be alright, but those will definitley be THE BEST. The good thing is, Humanities won't be filled with a bunch of stupid bimbos because they are all too illiterate to get into the class. Wheee! We sound like an angry bunch of people. Because we are. Anger makes the world go round!  For some reason, that reminded me...Bailey: "Ah Vicky you were really close with that Arkan-sass one."  Bwaha! That was too damn funny.  "ZOCH!"  Anyways, I  better be off...for now. I shall return.  -Shannon
