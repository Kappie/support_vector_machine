Same old crap, different day I suppose. I am working on the job situation, and I even have a couple leads! Telephone banker, Customer Service Rep, and I�m even applying to work on a cruise ship! I, of course, will let you know what comes of it. I was pondering the employment thing at rehearsal yesterday and I realized�I really love theatre. I don�t just like it, or watch it, or work it, I honest-to-God love theatre. I need to find someone or someplace that will pay me to do what I love. Is this possible? Is this too much to ask? I am finding out that here in the Antelope Valley that it is not possible. So I will sit and cry, work shows in my free time, and eventually get over it. Story of my life�.  Speaking of which, �Machinal� is coming to an AVC Black Box near you! Performance dates will be: Thursday May 8th 8pm Friday May 9th 8pm Saturday May 10th 8pm Sunday May 11th 2pm Friday May 16th 8pm Saturday May 17th 8pm It is going to be a great show!!! It is honestly the most fun and interesting show I have worked on to date, or at least acted in to date. I hope that all can get a chance to come and see it. For those out of the area, here is the  urlLink AVC Website  to get the address and any other information you can find.  Well, I am off to find a job. Mom will be here in 20 to pick me up�she loves me. I need to work on my attitude with her. I need to work on my attitude period. Oh well�tangent I do not have time to take you on. Till the next post!
