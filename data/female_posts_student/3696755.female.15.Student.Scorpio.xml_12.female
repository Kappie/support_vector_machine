So now ive decided to concentrate on #3. Like really i like him a lot. So im ganna go for it, im ganna focus and im ganna do this. I think my problem is im just kinda like i like you and you and you and ive never really set my sites on one person. And ive finally noticed that the people who are with who they wanna be with, worked on it, and waited, and concentrated on that one person, so ive decided im ganna change a little and try that cause i really like this guy. We get along real well, we have a lot of fun, we laugh and make fun of eachother a lot too. I dunno and like hes the only guy (literally) that ive ever met that im like we should hang out and usualy guy are just like for sure. but everytime if said that to him he like well yea! im free tomorrow lets do somthing. i dunno maybe a lot of guys are like that but none of the guys ive ever been around have been, its cool. And liike i no his friend told me that he wasnt sure if he liked me, but thats not a no, its a i could, its an ive got a chance. since he said that he liked the way things ae goin, things are ganna keep goin that way. and things well progress. i hope. but all i can do is try so thats what im ganna do, im  ganna buckle down and im ganna try, really hard. So wish me luck casue im on a mission. (i sound like an obessed stocker dont i.....? shit. im not tho! i promise!)
