I'm really exhausted after staying up the whole nite wrking through my assignment and yet not able to hit the word count which is so unlikely of me..normally, I'll exceed the word count by another few hundred or so... I don't feel good abt this paper, I prayed over it as I drop it into the dept essay chute.. I've to depend on God's grace on the outcome...  I missed wrk today, overslept from the supposedly short nap of 2 hrs tt became 5 hrs.. woke up, panic, miss call, called back, no answer, damn, call wrkplace, phew nick answered, explain everything, more or less settled, called Terence, felt shitty, Rosie called, bye baby, explained to Rosie, guilty...  How can I switch off the alarm, I don't even remember hearing it ring.. muz be damn tired..ritez now at 3.30pm outside is sunny yet cooling.. terrific day for a jog..but no trainers (I don't wanna risk wearing the fallin apart ones I've) Terence chided me for wanting to continue running despite my joints aching.. what to do since I'm flat-footed and stricken with old injuries (I sprained my ankles both sides, my knees swelled whenever I run too much, I've a slightly curved spine)I attribute all my pains to the flat-footedness.. Medically speaking, due to the lack of an arch, the ankles roll inwards, the knees roll outwards and pushes the hips inwards.. tt eventually affects the lower back and of coz the upper back... so this explains all..  Ok, gotta go and find food.. my pantry stock is running into the red.. similarly for my fridge.. hee hee I'll juz cook something.. have a pleasant day ahead..signing off, eve
