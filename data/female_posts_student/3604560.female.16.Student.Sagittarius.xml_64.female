Anyways    *DOh!*        Okay... Oh that's right i remember why i wanted to write... Okay. Here is the  news... I GOT MY      L    's!!!  how great is that... and i just came back from driving... let me just say i'm  glad i'm alive... seriously i got heaps of dirties from drivers... and one  driver even beeped at me! how cool....    now moving on. Who  wants a ride to school?    ã€€     okay ciao you  all... see ya in hell... i mean at school... Z-unit
