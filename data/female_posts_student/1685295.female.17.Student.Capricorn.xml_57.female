At first I didn't think it was possible, I mean who would do something this stupid? Well then for the sake of the human race I thought okay, maybe he lives far away and he had to take the mean leak. Nope, after finishing his leak, he went into a building which was about five feet away (for those who know where I live, I am talking about the building between the bike shop and the pharmacy). Why would you take a leak outside when you just go home and take one at home? If you don't have a bathroom at home, just go to a neighbor; they'll understand.  You must really suck if you have to create a rumor that you are creating the best game system ever, just to get some publicity.  Really can't you think of something else, like a new breakfast special at a nearby Applebee's or maybe the fact that you are lying little crack-heads who work at a strip joint in Florida Keys.  For those who don't know what I am talking about, I am referring to the  urlLink Phantom . I just heard over at  urlLink Penny Arcade  that it's probably a hoax. I agree, it sounded too good to be true; there are too many problems to overcome for them to make a console like this.
