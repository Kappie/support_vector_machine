Sort of putting on a face when it occurred to you to do it. Perhaps there's not a better time than the present, but had it happened before all this shit, we might have appreciated it better. All the same, it's alright.  What we're really looking for is your having no more reasons to need to apologize, I guess. Then again, it's about 1230 in the morning, and I'll have to go back and re-re-read your post.   Anyway, guys. A really quick word on summat. I don't, again, want to come off looking like a fuck for saying it, but if you really look at this, it's pretty sad. Case in point: DO  NOT  EVER   USE THE UNIT AS A LITTLE GARNER FOR YOUR OWN ATTENTION. The unit is for people that really need it, and chances are, most of you are not. Yes, something like this did happen already, I'm just telling you all in advance. You may think you're having a bad day and it's a really bright idea to check yourself in at Vandy, but I'll tell you, 1) it's not, and 2) it's just fucking NOT, man. I can tell you, you'll really regret it. Having talked to all of you at length, I can't really judge you as "clinically depressed" even on your worst days. So please, don't use this to draw attention to yourself when you feel lacking of it.  This post was NOT directed at anyone specifically on here, so don't be offended :) it's just a warning. I hate the unit, but by god if people are going to use it to be selfish sons'a'bitches.
