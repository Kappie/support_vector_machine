Also at this restaurant whenever I go to eat there, I'm seated at a table and soon after the all the staff decides to go on a lunch break;failing to inform me. When I wander back to the kitchen it is empty and no one is to be found except this one elderly back woman - who questions me about where my life is headed. I know I've had this dream at least 5 times now for sure. Another frequent thing is that I am constantly running into people I know, yet we do not speak to eachother. I'm not sure if this is because I'm in another world where we do not know eachother, or they want to avoid talking to me, as much as I would like to ignore them. There was one more thing I wanted to mention, but of course my short-term memory is failing me. I was once told that when you wake up you lied in bed for at least 10 minutes, you could let all of your dreams from the past night flow into you. But if you jumped right out of the bed, and into the shower, you would have difficulty remembering any of them. I should start allowing my dreams to re-establish a connection to me in the waking world, however often they frighten me. I feel like prey to my dreams. They scare me, because I am unsure of what it is that my mind is trying to tell me. I can never tell in my dreams that I'm dreaming ever, and ultimately feel hopeless, lost, and helpless. Some claim that they can manipulate their dreams. However that seems like risky business. The dreamworld is something that is very scary, yet very interesting, because I want to know more about myself and the world around me. Maybe I should pursue some research.  Do you dream in black in white?  I really hate blogger's new posting layout.
