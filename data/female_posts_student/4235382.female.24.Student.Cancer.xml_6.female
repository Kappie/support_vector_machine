I don’t know why my mind needs a slow start; it’s as if the chaos to come is kept at bay until I am ready, or at least that’s the illusion.   This morning, while making  coffee, I heard the sounds of distress. I figured my older hens were picking on the younger, which is natural. But natural doesn’t mean acceptable and chickens can be both brutal and stupid.  After the dogs wouldn’t stop barking, I went out. Sure enough, one teenage-chick was stuck in the back of the fenced enclosure, and the other chickens were trying to peck it to death.  Yelling STOP-IT at a chicken doesn’t work like with a dog.  Helping it meant finding a way inside. When I made the enclosure, I made no entry, except for the chickens, nor did I consider that I would ever need to get into their yard.   Arms first, I tried to crawl through their small, oak-framed, pagoda-style door.   I wiggled in past the shoulders, when it hit me that if my boobs wouldn't fit, neither would my hips, and I got stuck. I thought about getting pecked to death by the chickens. I thought about the fact that I was stuck on the ground in dirt and chicken poo, and I still hadn’t had coffee. I was glad I never installed that live-chicken web-cam I once thought would be great. Imagine that picture on the internet! After a few backward flops on the ground, I got out.  The search for wire cutters began.  I sorted through tool drawers, found the cutters, cut through the wire cage and forced my way in through the outside.  Even after that, I couldn’t get the darn bird out.  It was caught by the tongue and foot by some kite string. Maybe its foot was stuck and in trying to peck its way out, it literally got tongue-tied. Don’t know. I fetched the wire cutters and cut the string away, cradled the bird, then forced my way back through the chicken wire fence.   Getting out was a sadistic birth experience.  My arms and legs got cut up from the sharp wire, but the chick mouth was worse. The beak was bloody, clotted, string was coming out from under the tongue, over the tongue, but I couldn’t see why.  I called my vet and they won’t do birds, they did know someone who would, but then why take a dollar-fifty chick to a two hundred dollar vet?   Instead of calling the bird specialist, I got scissors, a flashlight, water and a paperclip.  I became McGuyver. Rinsing the mouth and seeing if it was strong enough to swallow were good indicators of what might come next. It was thirsty, which meant it still had a will to live. I wrapped it in a towel, held it upside down on my lap, then my youngest came in, I figured….a recruit!   She was made sick by the blood. I told her to put her feelings aside and hold the darn flashlight.  She was reluctant, but did it. “Oh mom, that’s Foxy.”  This chick had a name.   Caitlin had to focus on getting the light into the mouth and not getting in the way.  I figured she’d be the better for it, or else I’d soon have a dead chicken and barf to clean. “Mom, you’re bleeding.” “Yeah, I know,”  I said to acknowledge her alarm.   I used the straightened paperclip end to clean the debris, blood and to unknot, but couldn’t get it all out.  The scissors were too big to work in the chicken beak. It was like shooting a bazooka at a mosquito.   I ended up putting the search on for a smaller scissor, then cutting as much away as possible while avoiding the little chicken tongue. I don’t know how long it took, only that it seemed like forever.  After the oral surgery Caitlin cuddled the bird in a towel.  The chicken didn’t give up, and neither did we. Caitlin learned a bit about obligation, even when it’s messy, even if you have to bleed a bit.  Soon I’ll be reheating that coffee, but not before repairing the cut fence. In the immortal words of Sam th Hobbit, “There’s still a little good in this world, and it’s worth fightin’ for.”  Ok, I’m over forty and a bit too soft to squeeze through small doors, and I am not too sure about what the good is in a little chicken, but our pet Foxy will live and my daughter knows a little more about responsibility.
