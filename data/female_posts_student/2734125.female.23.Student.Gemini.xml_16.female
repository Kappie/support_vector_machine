These gaps have been forming in my reality.  Not so huge that they would force me into a new pattern, sublte and constant.  The solidness of things has been less... Consistent of late.  I will lean against something that is clearly suppose to be utterly solid, like a wall, and it will seem to shift and waver for a few moments.  Now, there are several ways to explain this away: I could be hungry, sleepy, or distracted.  These are the first self blaming techniques that people participate in when they are making excuses for realities inconsistencies.  There are only a few other options: that the realization that the universe is composed of tiny particles vibrating at a terrific and perfect pitch has some how made it possible for my brain waves to interfere and thus make things slightly less solid.  Maybe a form of science would have me believe this, and it could be true, or it could be a conspiracy.  I cant say more right now, who knows who's reading this...  It could be that I am super human and am slowly coming into my powers, and these powers include making solid objects not so solid... That could be cool, but only if I master it and then am able to use it consistently.  However, if my powers are at their zenith now, well, that would be lame.    There is always the possibility that reality is to blame, and not me.  What if that is the case.  We seem to assume that the world that we see, touch, feel, smell, lick, and groan at is indeed true.  That any lack of perception or gap in that understanding is our own fault.  We assume that everything is knowable.  We also have naturalized this train of thought... And believe that this is the way it has always been.  In fact, this conception of reality was not really dominant until the Royal College in England got a scientific bug up its ass, less then 200 years ago.  Damn.  Before that there was magic for magic's sake.  This is not the magic of parlor tricks and toothpaste (how do they get the stripes in cogate?  Magic). This magic was a magic that dominated reality and said that if your will, your words and your heart were strong, reality was only a breath away from shifting in your direction.    Now the Royal College did help stop some pretty petty persecution of witches and warlocks, but it also relegated magic to the closet.  Forced people with a creative mind to be considered dangerous, subversive, and crazy.  Thinking in an associative way was considered a disease, that needed to be destroyed and bred out of people.  The romantic period in writing was a backlash to that.  Scientific thinking stopped burnings, but it introduced eugenics and electric shock therapy.  There's always a price I suppose.  Reality became a much safer place, less malleable and manipulatable, and potencially knowable.  However, that made it a bit ridged and tight, people couldn't breath.    Take time for example.  Totally made up.  Time passes, timeline, timeout, time and time again.  Have you ever spent time with someone where you were able to move out of the time that consensus has created?  I have, and it is a disconcerting and invigorating process.  Time goes slow when your bored, moves fast when you are happy, having a good time.  This should prove to us that time is not that real.  Even the clock seems to be inconsistent when faced with intense experience.  You look up, and time has "flown" by.  You had the clock there, what happened?  Should have been consistent.  Magic, real magic, magic that is part of a flowing and very frightening inconsistent place that we live in.    Despite sciences best efforts we are still living in a magic place, only now we don't have the space in our minds to know it, and therefore control it.  Electricity: even if you can describe how it works and why it works, its still magic, and a ritual goes with it each time you use it.  "Well, I turn on the switch that makes the connection for the flow of energy, which heats up a filament.  The electric current came from a giant spinning coil of wire and that makes electricity because... And a light turns on."  You can go on with your explanations, but I counter, "I wave this stick and dance in this specific patter, that sends a message to the gods that we really fucking need water, and the message gets to them somehow... And then they send rain."  Magic, all, that we don't have a firm grip on.  Its sad really.  I think that people could do with a little hocus pocus.  A touch of the erotic unknowable.  Science seems to keep us, at least on its surface level, from celebrating the utter impossibility of life.  We are, or are we, either way we enjoy it.  Or we should.  If I could tap it, stand in a room that was not a room but a space filled with reality, I expect it would feel like ghosts kissing my eyelids and a rush of hot heating vent air and ecstasy and the moon disrobing her cape of stars, all at the same time.
