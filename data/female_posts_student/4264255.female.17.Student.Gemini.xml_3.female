Argh why does this always happen to me whenever i have something good i always mess it up some how, i would just be so mean sometimes (like start stupid arguments for no reason) just because i didnt want to get hurt. i dont know i dont really feel like discussing it, now i have to be happy that we are such good friends and focus on our friendship like caitlin said.  i think things will work themself out, besides serious relationships are hard in highschool especially senior year when your leaving soon.  right now i am watching mtv on mute so i can concentrate on doing this, but i do want to download some songs by lyfe who i just heard right now, he sounds a bit like maxwell.  uhhh i have the first day of school tomorrow which is poopy.  i have to wake up early and take my two younger sisters and then i am picking up mine and erics schedules and then taking him his because neither one of us have a first period and then hopefully we can either get some sleep or eat.  i am kinda excited to start school though because everyone secretly is, just this recent news isn't exactly going to make it as good.  mmmm i am eating some round table pizza right now.  okay well i am going to go and organize a binder for school tomorrow.
