(thats a store on the top of castro and market if ur brave enough... really funny stuff their. ur gauranteed to build a sixpack there). winged migration dvd is actually a good idea maggie. oh yea, and NO to any transgender paraphanelia. don't need any. i dunno- a good surprise would be nice cause i know what i'm getting from everyone else i know. so yea. :)
