I hate how weak i am.  i hate that i want him so badly and he is so indifferent to me. I hate how my desire for him annoys him. I hate how i need him more than he needs me i hate how he can never share things with me. i selfishly want to be the one he talks to when hes all mixed up like he is right now, the one he figures things out with. I hate how instead, im the one on the other side of the chasm trying to reach out to someone who doesn't want to be reached. I hate how i feel more alone right now then ever before.
