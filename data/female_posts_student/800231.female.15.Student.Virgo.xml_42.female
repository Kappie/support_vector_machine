So when the bell rang, Alice and I just left. We walked through the back fields and out to a woody little park across the street to sit for a while. It was pretty nice actually, we sat by the creek and contemplated the meaning of life. Which means I sat around playing with my lighter while Alice laughed her head off at nothing in particular. All in all, it was better than actually going to class.  Today I managed to pass out during math. Really, it was pretty odd, one minute I was half watching Mrs. B write things on the overhead and the next thing I know Cece is poking me in the back and telling me that class is over. I slept for nearly half an hour at my desk and no one bothered to wake me up. Not surprising though, Mrs. B knows that I only get 2 hours of sleep most nights after a time project we did. I'm an insomniac of the worst sort, I live on copious amounts of caffeine. Still, I've never just blacked out like that, weird...  Alice has just told me that my hair reminds her of a retro 70's sofa. Cheers.  If just noticed that Steph only tells me she loves me when she's stoned. I think I'm in an abusive relationship with a woman. She has spent a lot of time with her hand down my pants now that I think of it.   Helen and I have written a beautiful song on piano. Slow, pretty, instrumental, absolutely great. Even marketable, unfortunately our working title is "You Know You Want It Bitch". Doesn't really fit but it is a nice song. Actually, Lucia, Helen and I all write music. We can actually do some pretty good stuff when we aren't making asses of ourselves. Unfortunately, it's the stupid songs we write that our friends usually like. Some such examples:  "My Penis" "Pho-Na-Na" "Angela: Slut" "Move Like Moses" "I Don't Like You (So I'm Gonna Hit You with my Car)" and the infamous "My Penis (the Sophal remix)" Yeah.  I set a piece of licorice on fire during lunch. It's actually quite flammable. The teacher that walked by a few minutes later made me put it out though. Bastards...  I'm bored and way too hyper right now. I'm gonna go bounce off walls now. Bye!
