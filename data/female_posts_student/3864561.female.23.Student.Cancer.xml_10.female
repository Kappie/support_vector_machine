I must be honest, this morning's post was a bit disappointing; just one birthday card compared to two letters from the Inland Revenue (both addressed to Mr Rached Owyer, randomly enough).    Fortunately I went out for lunch with friends on Wednesday and received a few things then, so the current total stands at seven cards and five presents (including, bizarrely, two keyrings - not sure if people are trying to tell me something). Also I haven't seen Mum, Dad or Rob's parents yet, so that should be good for another three cards at least.    As I am writing I've noticed it's just started pissing it down outside. Given that the centre-piece of my birthday festivities this evening is an open-air concert (i.e. sitting in a field with a picnic), this is not good. I think God and I may have some bargaining to do.
