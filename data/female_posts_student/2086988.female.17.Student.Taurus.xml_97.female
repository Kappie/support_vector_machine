	 
      Can't fall asleep tonight I don't know what to do I hold my pillow but I want to be holding you And when I close my eyes  I always see you face I know my happiness is only a kiss away And every hour here in the dark  Every beat of my lonely heart  Tells me that I need to be with you  Heaven oh Heaven what can I do?   Heaven, oh heaven can't you help me? I'm down on my knees, please help me
