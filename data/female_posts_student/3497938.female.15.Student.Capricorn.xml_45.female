Dont tell Amanda. *lol* Not too much has really gone on. Me and Drew made up, and we are best friends again. I have to admit, I lied. I love him and I want to be with him, more than anything. He completes me. Me and Kayla havent made up yet, but im not going to be bothered with it anymore... Whatever happens, happens. My grandmother is doing alot better. Her bite doesnt hurt her much. I got a new phone. And it was about time. It is a Cingular LG flip phone. It's ok. Its pretty square, but cute. In it's own lttle way. *lol* Thats all I can think of to write about. I know I will be back to get on the internet. Ok, if I think of sumthin I'll write it down so I wrote forget it. Like someone else I know, AMANDA!!! *lol*
