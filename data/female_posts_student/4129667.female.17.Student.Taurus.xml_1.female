I mean, they do... but, you get the point.  Anyway, after a collision with Joe during frisbee, lots of running during practice today, and lots of sun trying to fry me up, I'm mighty tired.  And I definitely don't want to look at that pile of college applications that should have been sorted out and finished a while ago that's been building up in the corner of my room.  Or, for that matter, the pile of summer reading that I still haven't finished.  Or the SAT II book things that I should be checking out.  Hmmm.    In two days we will have a house.  Then in four days Joe leaves.  The in twelve days we move.  And three days after that school starts.  So the tally works out to be... house = good, end of summer = very, very, very bad.  Hockey may make up for that, though.  Weeee!
