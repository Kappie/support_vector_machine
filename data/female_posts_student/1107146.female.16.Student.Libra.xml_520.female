There's a huge spider living on my front porch, and as I went to run today (I just got back, so that can tell somethings about the darkness factor) I got caught in his web and he landed on me. And proceeded to buzz. It was the scariest thing ever. I screamed like a very little girl.  Well, that's ok, cuz my dad is coming back in a minute with new headphones! Yay! Get to work on a little acoustic side project I'm doing for my aunt...plus a few other songs here and there...that might come to light very soon.  Linds, I adapted your line...it has become, "The anger from without becomes the anger from within." It leaves a bit to think about, but it's part of a reel that's really awesome moreover. That's the screamed one in the left earphone, altho that bit is whispered four times before we break out the heavy shite. So, considering the rest of the song, the left side is the despair/screaming part, the right side is the aggression/rapping part. And they go together in my head and sound AWESOME.  But yes, the anger from without becomes the anger from within.  Hoo-hah! G'bye friends!
