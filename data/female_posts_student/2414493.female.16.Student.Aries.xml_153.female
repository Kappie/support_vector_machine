It then follows that I have no motivation whatsoever to practice.  Everything is better with hot sauce, or so I have discovered.   John from the Examiner finally sends me back an email saying they want to run a cultural section for the May 6 issue. Do I want to do it? It kind of makes me feel queasy. But it's good work. I start thinking of college again, stupid me.   Couldn't go to sleep last night. Imagined that I could drive and I'd parked Dad's car in this long parking lot, but I'd neglected to lock it. Then thieves stole it, along with 75% of the other cars in the parking lot. I couldn't help crying and saying sorry to Dad and thinking I'd never get a car of my own. And I had this dream twice. It'll be a sign. When I get my own set of keys I'll make sure the word LOCK or something is tattooed to my hand.  But I'm paranoid.
