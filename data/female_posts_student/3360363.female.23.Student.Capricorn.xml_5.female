She was wearing one of those India-style hippie dresses in bright purple, a pair of truly godawful sandals, plastic gold crown poised on her head, princess-like. And she was dancing around on the sidewalk, smiling and kissing some goodlooking guy with too much facial hair. Something about the scene irked me and I think I forgot the shampoo. On the way back the air smelled of spring and sea, tinged with a hint of melancholy (or, in retrospect, nostalgia) and I realized I'd seen myself, five years before.
