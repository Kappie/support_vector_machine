So, after a pitiful (and, let me reiterate, PITIFUL) showing on the last Histology practical, I've been obsessively-compulsively (well, not really) studying for the upcoming final Histology practical. And, after doing some preliminary review/studying, some things are finally clicking into place.   For example, the intercalated disks. For those unfamiliar with these histological structures, they are junctions found in cardiac muscle tissue. They have lateral and transverse components which, before today, contained junctions that were beyond my comprehension. Today, in Hammer 412, I had an aha! An epiphany, if you will. It's all coming together. I'm LEARNING. Who'd have thunk it?
