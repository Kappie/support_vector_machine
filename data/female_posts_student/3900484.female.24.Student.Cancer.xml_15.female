TattooB: No.    BunHug: They're really good, I made them, and I make the best cookies out of anyone. That's my sales pitch.    TattooB: ....(looking at me)...    BunHug: I've sold two of them allready, I'm a culinary artiest.    TattooB: ...(still looking at me)... So are those for tomorrow?    BunHug: Yup, Bec's a little slow on the cookie cooking, so I thought I'd help her out...    TattooB: Bec???    BunHug: Long blonde hair, normally opens on weekends?    TattooB: Oh yeah, she's not here as much as the rest of you. (indicating he thinks Im a looser)    BunHug: Can I get you something? (Starting to wonder why he's still standing and staring at me, I know Im beautiful and all, but this is a little much...)    TattooB: (indicating his steaming coffee) My coffee.    BunHug: I'm sorry, you don't have to get a new cup everytime you come in you know, free refills and all. (as starting to ring him up)    TattooB: They threw my cup away! (indicating his employers at the tattoo parlor across the street)    BunHug: I'm sorry, next time just tell me to shut up and ring up your coffee.    TattooB: (Laughs as he exits)
