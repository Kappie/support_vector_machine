I've had two responses so far. From an email I sent to well over six or eight people. Well there goes the clown. It's probably too late to book, and I couldn't have anyhow because the idiots didn't give me there frigging money. Well I guess I'll have to make somephone calls. I hate makeing bitchy bank phine calls.
