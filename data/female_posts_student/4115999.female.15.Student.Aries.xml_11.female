I feel like sky-diving anyone wanna join me? When will I ever meet a guy that I truly c  onnect with. I like someone now, but I pretty sure they don't like me like I like them, but oh well I suppose. I have a deep feeling for a serious relationship like a few of my friends, but I'm not predicting that anytime soon in the forecast of my boring "love life" or "like life" whatever you want to call it. Eh, I got to sneeze....Just thought I'd let you all know that. Welp, my fingers are tired so ITS OVER!!!
