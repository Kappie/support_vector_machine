Idk it just seems like the times I'm most talkative nobody seems to be around or not many even care to talk.  Idk...whatever.  Gah I'm so whiny.  I've noticed that the times i'm most talkative are at night...idk...i think everyone's thoughts unfold and their true selves are unmasked...idk if that made sense to any of you, but it did to me. So that's why it's being documented now.  Hmm...I need to write more.  This is a nice release of thought and it feels...healthy.  It's been a while since I've done any kind of writing for myself...  Obviously I'm just rambling on...there are so many thoughts in my brain.  Enough for now.
