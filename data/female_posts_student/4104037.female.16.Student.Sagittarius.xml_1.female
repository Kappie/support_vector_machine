Then I realised that yesterday I was also in a strange mood and my mood today was derived from yesterday, not because I have the same worries but because Im worried that I was worrying because subconsciously, I didnt want my happiness taken away. But Im alright now that Ive figured it out... Its odd how those things work.    I also take conmfort in this blog. I can write things about people and not worry, since no one knowns this is me. Its just 'reality speaking'. I do like comments though, Id like some comments. I think Dmitri is one of a kind... Im not sure if hes a soul mate, but we have so much in common. So much has opened up in emails between us for a whole year... And especially this summer. When I knew him in 9th grade, I didnt get to know him to the extent that I do now. I think we knew there was something connecting us, thats why we talked sometimes. I remember also at lunch, when I was by myself, hed come sit with me. Even if we didnt speak... I felt alright. Im always glad to get emails from him now... Its almost a relief. Even though Im not alone anymore, even though Im not unhappy... And its not a romantic feeling, that somehow frees me. The way that you could have someone close of the opposite sex and not have those feelings get in the way. Thats what went wrong with David... But to a slightly complicated level, since thats not all that went wrong. He didnt respect me. I forgive him though, theres not much of that left in the world. I still miss him sometimes, but I never know what I miss. Its so hard to describe the way I feel about him. I cant love him... Love is happiness.     Whatever there is between me and David is irrelivant now, and Im glad of it. The thing about him is that HE always comes with complications, ALWAYS. And I cant do with that... My life is not complicated anymore. Im free, Im happy, Im young and Im living my life. Im not sure if he is. But either way, Im glad it doesnt involve me. Because what Im doing doesnt involve him.    Im happy to say Ive met the person in this world that is the exact opposite of me, though. And we both know it. Its almost funny. I think he respects me now... I think we both wish each other the best. Its so much easier parted. Its better saying 'I wish you all the best' and going on with our opposite lives. Its good to have this strange and distant connection. It doesnt make sense to anyone but me and him.    And horray for blogger.com... I can let myself go and write all this!
