I should have known how the conversation would go when I picked up the phone and she screamed "I'm NOT high! I'm just really up there today, ok?!". She couldn't understand why the couch kept throwing her across the room. Well, and she wanted to read me a preschool book about ducks that she had found and decided was the best thing she had ever read. I don't even know what she was on but it was pretty damn amusing.  Other then that I spent the entire day feeling like scum. I was cutting one of my house rabbit's nails today and cut into the quick. God, there was blood everywhere, even after applying 800 pounds of styptic powder. I felt like such a fucktard. He's ok now, it looked a LOT worse then it was. Thank god.  I really need to contact Steph but I have no way to do so. She left her cell phone at her real house and I don't know the number for her foster people's house. I really hope she's ok.
