A few of my wonderful friends from TEC are planning on going so i'm looking forward to see 'em! :) aw, I'm in a really good mood right now b'cuz i just got done talking w/ Brian on the phone! It's funny how talkin 2 someone can cheer up ur day. I'm just amazed by him. I went 2 the library yesterday w/ Emily 'n got some books..I'm reading 'Angels Watching Over Me' by Lurlene McDaniel. I haven't really started it yet, but the title reminds me so much of my friends! ~Good friends are like stars, you don't always see them but you know they're always there~"Friends are angels that come from above. Sent down from  God  for you to love. So if you are sad, and don't know what to do. Just remember that I care for  you !" They are the reason I'm here today! (along with God's help) THANK U ALL 4 UR SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS! love u!!!! take care!             rAcHeL
