I mean one cant actually be "unemployable" can they? Micro biology is awesome! I absolutely love that class and the labs as well! I could do gram stains all day. I am considering work in that field now... and it has even made DNA interesting to me... but the bacteria are what calls to me. WOW! One amazing world under the microscope. Liz was pissed because I didnt actually mention her in my notes here... so there it is... you have now been mentioned! LOL! Actually she is part of most of my days so you will get to know her. Do know this... She is very proud of her breasts! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Lucas, my bf is almost too good to be true and there is alot there to know about us... so when you hear these names later you know who I am referring to. My kids are all doing camp stuff this summer and are as awesome as they are a pain.... never thought I could see anyone both ways.???? Josh is my oldest and only boy, Lidi is the middle and honestly funnest, most well adjusted of the bunch, and Emma is the youngest... most defiant little cutie pie I know. HA! Not sure if I will ever post pics of them as that kind of makes me nervous. I do have to say that Lidi proudly annnounced the other day while hiking that she does not pee on others only herself! I fell out! Almost peed myself laughing. My dog is officially too old to hike I think... the old sap. I am silly enuf to probably try the wagon next time. hehe. Ok not that silly. I dont have many gripes unless it involves my life so complaining isnt my genre. Just chatting away and maybe make a few friends. Well gotta go collect the animals... and I do mean animals... they are somewhat tame tho. HA!
