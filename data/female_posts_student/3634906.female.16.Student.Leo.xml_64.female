I'm all bummed because by now my Aunts and grandma have called me and set up my birthday shopping and they havent!!! I mean I know that I am going on saturday but I dont know when or where... and I still have to decide where I want to eat... erp... thats the worst thing to have to decide... I think I want noodles and company... haha... joking maybe we'll do lunch there and then dinner somewhere else... we always go somewhere really nice and expensive because its to celebrate!!! haha... we'll see and tonight I am going to eat with my dad and Veronica and Kevin... I might take a friend I dont know... maybe not... we'll see... but I decided that I wanted to eat at pizza hut... haha... yeah I have a choice to go anywhere and I decided on pizza hut... I'm a big loser when it comes to food... I've been wanting pizza hut real bad so I just decided that that was where I would like to go... My hand is starting to cramp... grrr... but yes... last night we didnt watch Kill Bill we watched Lost In Translation because Britt had to be home too early to watch volume 1 and I really just want to watch volume 2 because I'm sick of number 1... yeah but it was nice to have them over... even if James fell asleep and they were only here for about 2 hours... even so... good times... and to make Mandy feel better... deep down inside I am flippin' shit over here about not having classes or lunch with anyone... but I am trying to ignore that feeling and remember that its only 1 year and senior year will rock... I am sure that we will get used to having new and different people around... erp... even though I dont want to... grrr... damn it... oh well... BOO FRICKITY WHO... maybe I should just cry about it... haha... anyways... I will probably update tomorrow because its going to blow ass... no one is even going to be around to do anything... :( ... I almost want to cry... oh well... every birthday has blown ass in one way or another... life goes on... at least I will be 16... finally... erp... well I am going to go... I need to shower... wow I stink... haha..     byes     -gabby
