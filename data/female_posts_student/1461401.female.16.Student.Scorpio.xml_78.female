Incase you haven't checked them out yet... DO IT! JUST DO IT DAMNIT! WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM!? There, I'd done my part in spreading Flogging Molly awarness. In case you haven't been able to notice, I'm not quite in my right mind this morning. Or is it afternoon yet...? I don't know. Don't really care right now. I read the 5th harry potter yesterday. Man that was good. Well, ok, I finished it yesterday. I started it the day before. :-D I'm such a geek. Oh well, it's not like I have any kind of social life to distract me from reading... *glares evily* Oh well. Man, I still keep thinking about friday night. It was like, the best time I've had all summer. "Oooh, Kristin's puttin on the moves" "Shut up mork" heeheehee, good times had by all. Except for maybe Maggie...? Maggie, if you're reading this, are you ok? I hope so. Heh-heh, and amber forgot any kindling for the fire. Wow, that was pricless. Ah well, I believe I've spent enough time rambling on here. ~Moi
