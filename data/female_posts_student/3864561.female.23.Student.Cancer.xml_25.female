     
      I'm feeling quite emotional today; I'm going for my "20 week" scan (those observant among you will have worked out I'm actually 21 weeks pregnant today but they couldn't fit me in last Wednesday) at half past eleven and we're hoping to find out the sex of the baby.  To be honest I really don't have a preference whether it's a boy or a girl; I actually have a feeling it might be a girl but on the other hand if it's a boy at least we know what we're going to call it (Christopher - after my brother).  Anyway, watch this space for an update this afternoon......
