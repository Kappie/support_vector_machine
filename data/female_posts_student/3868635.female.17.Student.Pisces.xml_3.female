While everyone chattered about whatever mindless thought popped into their heads, I found myself wondering when that moment was, when was that moment that we all began maturing at different rates, our personalities spiraling off in oppisite directions? It's not that I didn't enjoy myself, but can I honestly still call them my best friends?   Who in the past could I have really called my best friends. Two people spring to mind, and interestingly enough both friendships were destroyed by relationships-one being engaged by both parties of the friendship, and one due to an outsider edging in. I find myself missing both, but particuarly one more than the other.  We have grown up together, knowing each other since we were 2. For awhile, I felt myself compelled to talk to her about issues, she seemed the most level with me. Especially for more worldly issues. She didn't mark me as strange when I would call at any random time and begin babbling on about some random conspiracy that I have just discovered, so my newest evidence that the wolrd will be ending soon. In fact, these phone calls were even reciprocated. We could talk about our lives, and the lives that we live. It never seemed to end, and while conversations with others would tend to follow down that never ending path, it would usually turn into a monotone drone on and on about the same old things. That, or into gossip about so and so. I hate when friendships reduce to that. The feeling that it is so necessary to have a conversation with someone that it isn't real, it's instead all about so and so.   I want so and so out of my life. They have plagued it for too long. I want conversations to regain meaning. Why don't I feel anything anymore? When was the last time that I did?   On my walk home this evening, i realized that I may appear as if I am becoming depressed again. But I don't feel depressed...should I? I just feel as if something is missing, that I'm lacking something that used to be there. Things just don't click when we're together anymore.   I just really want someone that I can talk to and have a connection with. Just someone that I can discover. I want to connect with another human-it's been so long since I have. I realize that this is becoming repetitive, but I don't care. I suppose I figure that if I talk it out, perhaps things will become more clear.   In fact, I am really glad that I have started this. Writing in my diary has just gotten depressing as before, I found myself writing it to someone. Someone that I could count on to always be there to invade my privacy. But I didn't mind, he knew me better than anyone, and I knew him. The bond that we share is inexplicable...who knows where it originated, and while we can deny, I am starting to realize that it will always be there. It's just a strange connection on who knows what level. I don't know if I have ever felt as at ease to tell anyone some of the stuff that I've told him. On top of all that, right before our friendship depleted due to the new coming relationship type thing, he experienced a whole side of me that no other has. I was able to express myself as a physical being and not only emotional. Now when I look back on it, I feel silly that he knows more about me than any other, and he is just another face in the hallway. I think that I have come to terms with it though, I just wish that I had someone new that I felt that comfortable with.   If I could be anywhere right now, I'd be lying on a grassy hill, looking up at the stars with the company of a human. I wouldn't care who, but just someone that I wouldn't feel compelled to talk to. Just another human beside me. Someone to cure my chronic loneliness. That's what I love about cities, crowds, just anywhere with people is the energy from other humans. I sometimes wish that I could stand in the middle of a crowd, invisibly and just take it in.   I had always vowed to not get hooked on drugs or alcohol because it is an escape, but that's what is happening. Days without having a joint or two are becoming nearly unbearable. Or just a shot or two. Anything to take a little of the responsibility off of me of having to behave. Behave in no matter what maner, it woulnd't matter. It's too hard to figure out how I should act...how do you know what to do or say? They help you decide, help you not care. Prom was amazing for that reason. I left inhabitions behind and just allowed myself to be taken over. As a result, I thouroughly enjoyed myself. I got to live my life as someone else. It was like watching a movie but I got to experience. For once I was the star that got to dress up, say those witty lines at the cheesiest of moments, throw caution in the wind and do as I wished. It was the perfect oppurtunity and I got to write the script. I didn't second guess a thing, I just acted impulsivly and it was the most amazing relieved feeling in the world.   Same sort of with the cottage, when I felt that I could not tollerate a situation, I had a beer or a rum and coke. I got relaxed. Although I'm disapointed that I did have that heroine with the weed, I don't regret it. I didn't feel as if I was out of control, my mind just-well I felt good. That felt good. I was relaxed. That's what cottages are for though, right?  I would like to know though the reason why my working is inferior to everyone elses. I put up with the same stuff, I worked just as much this week as everyone else. So what? I get paid a little more. That's just in the description of my position. I didn't apply for a minimum wage mcjob. Why can't I express my feelings towards work along with everyone else when they are? Some things just drive me up the wall.   Oh well, this was just another day in my life. I think that I will now retreat to my bed and relax. Tell myself a bedtime story about what *may* happen in the future. Afterall, a girl must do what she has to to keep her head above water, n'est-ce pas?  Farewell for this evening...
