The other better thing (not the guy one)that have been waiting for the past week for!!! I'm so excited, I'm doing the circle dance.. whoo hoo!!! Thank you for those who were thinking positive! KZ it was great to get together, next time, lets discuss the future instead of failures. Like you said, lets be positive and happy, cause that's when good things come! (I'm losing weight and I even have real nails too!!)    I won't be online for a little while, dog / cat sittin, so gimme a ring (those who I  WANT   to call me)if ya wanna get in touch!    Take care, KZ let me know about Sunday the 25th.    cya all later!    love, me :)
