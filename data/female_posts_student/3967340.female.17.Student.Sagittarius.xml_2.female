Those guys are like brothers to me there so cool and fun to be around. but anyways back to the real stuff...Ok what am i suppose to think? You tell me "every relationship is based on trust" "just trust me" but then i get all these mixed messages. Is she gone for good or is there something there? I know you aren't going to get over her that fast but i dont know if i should back off and leave you alone or not. What am i saying i dont even know if you care about me like that. Im just so tired of getting hurt relationship after relationship and honestly i dont know why i put myself out there like this. In the words of robert... why can't things be like 1993? Those days that was our childhood and things were so much easier.
