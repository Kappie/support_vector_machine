The play went well, overall, even though the crowd was very unresponsive today. All is going relativly well, it seems. I think my cough is getting a little worse today, which worries me a bit as I have to go back to the doctor tomorrow and I really want it to seem like I'm getting better. Not worse. Much better. Think of what a day it would be if...  Never mind. Don't worry about it. I am well.  So, so you think you can tell heaven from hell blue skies from gray   how I wish... how I wish you were here
