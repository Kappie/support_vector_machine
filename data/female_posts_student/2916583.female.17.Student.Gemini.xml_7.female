Back to pi day.  The math department offers small pies for a dollar each, and they're in six flavas - cherry, apple, pecan, lemon, chocolate èclair and blueberry.  I love apple pie.  It's yummy and reminds one of the bread store.  Lemon and chocolate èclair are good too.  I was just thinking about cherry flavored stuff when I looked at my sister's cherry flavored lip gloss.  She ordered seventeen and they gave her this cherry-red makeup bag and it had cherry lip gloss, Neutrogena shampoo  conditioner, and Neutrogena body wash.  Seventeen's actually a pretty cool magazine.  It's not just about articles like, "The makeup to make him notice you!" or "Fifteen dresses that make you look like a skank!" (because most teen magazines are incapable of using a period).  Like right now, I'm reading an article on North Korean girls sold into slavery.  That's soo sad.  I honestly could not be someone's servant...I suck at serving people.  The one time my sister bribed me into being hers, I took all kinds of breaks and quit after taking a long bath.   Ever listened to reggae?  I mean, besides all the rastafarians out there who listen to it because of religious reasons.  Do rastafarians smoke weed because of their religion?  I know people who smoke it, but not for religious reasons.  I think it would be awesome to be smoking it and when someone says something, you could say, "I'm fufilling my duty to God to smoke this."  That reminds me of a poster in the journalism room.  It makes religious philosophies out of the phrase, "s**t happens."  Here's the link: http://www.thejaywalker.com/pages/shit_happens.html.  I think Andrew found that site.   Where does the word "random" come from?  I have the most random thoughts, like this one :Who invented the word random?  I know that some guy said that he could introduce a word into the English language, then wrote quiz all over Dublin, and that's how teachers can give us abominable mini tests.  How does one go about introducing a word into the English language?  Brittany (from yearbook) and I tried to start the word popalar, but we forgot over winter break.  It would be cool if we had eighteen words for snow, like Eskimos do.  There could be yellow snow, wet snow, snowball/snowman snow, sledding snow, and so on.  Actually, I would rather have warm temperatures than eighteen words for snow.  Well, I have one last thing to say: ***SHAHEEN FOR WORLD DICTATOR!!*** Later   Eight indicates the possibility of great success in business, finance, and politics.  You are practical, ambitious, commited, and hardworking.  You can also be jealous, greedy, domineering, and power-hungry.  Eight is said to be the most unpredictable of numbers and can indicate the pinnacle of success of the depths of failure; it can go either way.
