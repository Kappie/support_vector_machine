Nine AM till 7 PM if you count the signing party (which was torture, because the only people who came were your typical preppy snobs...oh, wait, that's 95% of the student body...) and I had to do paperwork the whole time. Whatever possessed me to volunteer to be ad manager? Argh.  Not to mention I spilled red juice on my brand new shirt. :'( Mom says it'll wash out, though...gosh that sounds childish.  This year is going to be so hectic. I hope I don't end up having to quit work...I don't think I will, but with band and homework and yearbook I dunno if I'll have time (and patience) for it all!  OK, enough complaining. Off to watch The Whole Nine Yards now... :)
