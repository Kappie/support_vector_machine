The only thing that wasn't as great was the music - there were like two slow songs and almost everything else was rap. It was annoying. But it was okay because it was so much fun.

Graduation is also optional." -- Professor Brian Quinn  "Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies. I don't mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think.
