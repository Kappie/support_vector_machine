I have always been pretty interested in this stuff, but was reminded when I was reading blurbs in   Cosmopolitan   while at my aunt's house. One blurb cited a study that 'proved' that women's mental suffered when cohabiting while men's thrived. The source was not cited. I've been browsing online and found a few weak sources including   urlLink this poll   which was conducted in the UK.      I am continuing research on this, but I realize there is a lot of ambiguity and confusion. When I cited the initial blurb to my boyfriend, he reacted defensively, which could be expected. I also told him about what I read in my women's lit class that dealt with women's mental health and marriage, and again he saw such literature as subtle man-hating. I can see his perspective. I also keep thinking about a study I read a few years ago about a rise in cohabitation in the U.S., which I recently looked up and found   urlLink interesting results  . While the reliability of this reading is up in the air, I like that it discusses the pros and cons, as well as the reasons people are choosing to live together more than ever. I have questioned my own motives a lot and have come down to financial reasons as one of the biggest motivating factors. More on this later.
