It's a pretty kick arse game. This is like FF: CC: it's meant to be played in multiplayer mode. But like FF: CC, I still enjoy the single-player mode, so screw anyone who thinks that FSA sucks. Idiots. I've been having a lot of fun playing it, even if I'm just playing it by myself. Cool thing is that I got a GBA Cable for free. w00t. I sold my Wavebird Wireless Controller because it wasn't working anymore, but just for 8 dollars. Yeah, it's not much but that's the most they were gonna give me. Err.    FSA is a lot like ALttP. There's ALttP songs, enemies, items, and much more. Just like in ALttP, you have to rescue the maidens that are trapped in crystals. I find FSA's style a lot like FF: CC, and it's kinda spiffy. I love both of those game, even though a lot of people didn't like them. Well screw 'em. There's also a few TWW stuff, like bosses and crap. Overall, it's a good game. I forgot to mention that I also bought a new controller 'cause none of the ones that I had were working, like I've mentioned before. Right now I'm Near the Fields (L4), and I'm gonna start on the first... place-thingy. So, yeah, that's it for my "report" of FSA.    I also heard that the Nintendo DS, the most spiffy portable system there will be known to mankind, will be released in November (or some time before 2004 is over). Crap. I gotta save up for the Nintendo DS or I'll be behind  everything.  The bad thing is that Maetroid Prime 2: Echoes is also coming out in November, which is another great game. Oh goddess, too many games, so little money. >_
