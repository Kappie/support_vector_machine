Now we seem to be more together, with class ppl meeting up regularly to go out (almost every month and whenever someone returns from Australia)...of course not everyone......but for those who do actually turn up, it makes for adamn good time and great bonding, hardly realising it.  Also, the ppl who come for the microscopic class gatherings in make strange combinations....ie they come from all different cliques and werenot close at all in Crescent, eg Caili, Sandra, Rachel Ho,Iffah,Xiu, me, June, CCS...etc...I mean, can u imagine such a group gg out together on a Saturday afternoon in Sec3 or Sec4? And still all enjoy each others' company to the fullest.  My point is,4S2 is still intact to a large extent and is still evolving. It didn't disintegrate.  4S2 ismore like some popular TV show who's series has ended and all the actors move on to other projectsand there is a spinoff series.  Or the Fellowship of the Ring. Or something that broke up.   In the same way we all have our own lives outside 4S2 now. But are still connected by the fact that once in our lives we were all together in the same container class.  Ok. Enough of metaphors.And one more thing: I don't think we can ever fully appreciate our lives until they've become the past. 4S2 was oftenterrible while we wereactually in it.Though i guesssometimes not.  All thanks to CCS for organizing all the gatherings and the people who invented SMS and blogs
