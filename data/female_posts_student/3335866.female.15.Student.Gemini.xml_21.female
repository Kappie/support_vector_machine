If it wasn't for her, I might never have realized that there was a perverted way to interpret my blogging-name as well. So I've spent all this time changing everything around. And I'm tired, and she sucks. Big time.  I have nothing to say here. I just wanted to republish this thing one more time, and I'm too tired and frustrated to figure out the probably quite simple alternative way to do that. I just got 3 new Yahoo! email addresses in a row. I'm on the warpath. Heads are going to roll... after I get some sleep.'Night (Notice the pointed lack of the word 'good'.)
