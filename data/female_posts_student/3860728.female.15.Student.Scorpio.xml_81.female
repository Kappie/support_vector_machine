I just realized i still haven't eaten anything, but when i woke up (around 1:30) i got on the computer, vacuumed the floor in the hallway, and talked to stacia. Q called too... dumb ass. Iunno, maybe i'll call him back.. maybe i won't. I have yet to hear from Ashley.... i don't know wheter to be angry or worried. Uhhhh i have to go get some shots (its going to be fucking horrible) and when i tried to unplug the speakers from my old computer i hit my head hard. I have this big ass mosquito bite on my ankle.. i mean its fucking HUGE and it itches like hell. I might make another recording... iunno.. who knows. My dad's birthday is on Thursday (he'll be 42) but luckily i already bought his birthday stuff... SUNNY CAME HOME WHICH IS GOOD CUZ I MISSED HIM, BUT BACK B/C NOW LAVENDER IS GOING TO HAVE TO SLEEP IN HERE AGAIN AND I CANT STAND HER... most of the time anywho. Uhhhh, i played with missy today... tomorrow spirit has a check up at the doctor ( i still can't believe she forgot how to walk) and ummmm.. oh yeah i took a shower and masturbated until i drooled (god it felt good). Thats all.. ciao.  I walk with a limp cuz my nuts heavey I like to hit from the back so keep ur butt steady... heh.
