She is a witch, She's cast her spell, He's in her control But no one can tell...  But I, I can see, His eyes are in a trance And now he hates me...  Because of you, You bitch, You should die, You took my father And he thinks that I, Am in the wrong When what he hears, Is your siren song.  You better understand, That you will suffer, Your sadism will catch you, Your path will get rougher.  You think you are so righteous, But really your clothed in vomit, Some day you will be in agony, And no one will stop it.  You will sit on your throne Next to satan your friend, You'll think you've won, But then there'll be a dead end,  He'll pat your little head, saying, "Well done my minion," But fear will strike your face, When you realize my vision:  Your destruction is inevitable, You'll both be sent to eternal torture, "And vengence will be mine!" says I, Welcome to your deserved fortune.
