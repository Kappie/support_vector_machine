(you cannnot out-punctuate me Jonathon!) Am starting to get seriously concerned about platinumblonde though - anyone heard from her at all lately????  So it's another beautiful day. Why does sunshine make you feel SO much better? Had lectures and other stuff yesterday, but got lots of work done.  It's strange how I was so UNproductive on Monday when I had the entire day free to work, but yesterday the words just flowed.    Today at chreche we took all the kiddies outside all morning, which was lovely, but am now worn out after running races, chase games, trampolening and baby holding!  Some of the kiddies were poorly today and so rather grizzly, which makes it harder - but it was fun.    Today is Navs day - AAAAaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I totally forgot to set the video for ER! OH MY GOODNESS!  Oh but actually it is the episode I saw in Canada - ok crisis over.  Oh I am extremly pleased that Jonathon has seen the light and started reading Stuart McLean - well done you.  I have listened to THE FLY every night this week and still haven't made it passed the first 5 minutes!
