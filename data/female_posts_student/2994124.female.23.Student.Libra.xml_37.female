I was being stupidly stubborn last night and didn't go to bed till mdinight my time which was over 36 hours since I had woken up last, but anyway my Mum woke me at 8:30 this morning when she went to work, but I went back to sleep and woke up at 10:30.  So am feeling slightly more with it. Plus I am sitting here in my PJs, with a wonderful pipping hot Tim Hortons mug of tea (am afraid its english with milk though but you can't win them all).  Stuart McLean kept me company last night before I drifted off to the land of nod but I now know what Melanie means when she only ever hears the first 10 minutes!  I think all I remember is: "On Sunday Dave and his wife Morley, slept in. On Monday too. Dave had forgotten he had implugged the alarm."  I visited the Vinyl Cafe website but they are only doing tours in Alberta and Suscatchuan (however you spell it). So I emailed them requesting a visit to the UK!  Ouch that was hot! (The tea) So I'm not going to put you through a minute by minute account of my entire trip, but I thought I'd just mention the highlights or some of them at least (in no real order of bestness accept the first one of course!)   1. Scoring 9 out of 10 for ER watching! (Told you I could do it Debs!) 2. Sliced pears and peanut butter 3. Kayacking in Victoria harbour and the Pacific ocean 4. Taking a bike up the coast of Vancouver Island 5. Death by Chocolate 6. Lingirie shopping (I bet nobody has even seen anyone as embarrassed as I was!) 7. Lying in Melanie's living room surrounded by candles listening to Vinyl Cafe 8. Going to the coffee shop to read  9. Spending 2 hours unpacking an ENOURMOUS truck of furniture with 6 random folk who were all lovely 10. Driving Melanie and Nathan's car (it was only like for 1 block whilst M ate her burger!) 11. Hot toasted bagel with cream cheese 12. Painting on Melanie's floor 13. Going to the kid's mall on Granville Island (they even have this kids size door to enter through!) 14. Learning how to smack someone's arse! 15. Having amazingly in depth discussions with Melanie about things I would NEVER dream of talking about outloud 16. Having a picnic in Stanley Park with a picnic HAMPER (he he!) 17. Watching the Mission ( I HATE injustice, what they did was SO unfair) 18. Playing at the park (where some totally irresponsible person went on the baby swings and broke it! Can you believe it! I mean who would do a thing like that?!) 19. Going to a session at Parliament - they bickered like kids at kindergarten 20. Watching Survivor (it was SO traumatic!) 21. Meeting tons of amazing and wonderfully friendly people 22. Tim Hortons 23. Kraft Dinner (which did strange things to my digestive system!) 24. dill pickle dip and chips (there are rather a lot of references to food here! I promise I did more than just eat!) 25. Second hand bookshops 26. Climbing trees - or more hilarious was usually attempting to get back down again 27. Seeing spandex boy in the flesh - or should I say in the spandex! 28. My asking some poor British girl who I had only met 10 minutes previously, where she bought her underwear! I thought Canadians, and especially Melanie, weren't stun-able - I was WRONG!! 29. I KNOW! (I love you Melanie) 30. Learning it's ok to let yourself love someone and be loved in return 31. Dsicovering the art of a good hissy fit! 32. learning THERE IS ENOUGH GRACE.... EVEN FOR ME!  I could go on but I won't. So that was Canada. Am seriously considering emigrating there now....I wonder if Death by Chocolate would employ me??? Mind you the coach driver to Victoria did offer me a job as a tour guide as I seemed to know more about Vancouver and Victoria than he did!    So the time has come for me to get and get clean. But my parents shower has broken whilst I was away so we have to use the pathetic one in the other bathroom which I could spit faster than, and which after being in Canada, where the shower burns a whole in your back if you stay in any one position for too long, I would probably be better off going outside and using the hosepipe!  mex
