I'm not having any doubts about us  nor do I think that we wont last  but I'm scared that you'll leave me someday  after all that I've done in my past  I feel like every time something is wrong  you think of the past and get mad  I dont know why Im the one always wanting more  because you're the best thing that I've ever had  I want to try and make everything better  and I dont want you to think anything else  I dont want us to break up, and I dont want anything more  all I want to do is just help  I know you're depressed, but you wont admit it  I know you think you cant get help, but you can  medication can take some of it away  but you dont want that and I somehow understand  I'm not saying it's your fault how you feel  because it's not your fault and we know that its true  but medication can help calm your "hormones"  and it will help our relationship too  I think you should try and get better  because being sad all the time isn't good  I'd like to be hugging and kissing you now  and every second that I possibly could  I want you to be happy, and stay that way  I dont want you to be sad anymore  I want us to love and  cherish  eachother  like we did for so long before...   I  cherish  so many  memories ...
