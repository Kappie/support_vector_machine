Last nite, got a call frm Jac...really worried for her..she crash her car into a tree..my goodness muz be real frightening.. she smash her face and was bleeding from her nose and mouth.. really worried for her...cos I don't know what I'll do if something worst happen... but praise God she is safe... I think a spiritual battle is going on for her.. cos of the Hindu medium...I have been praying for her ever since that nite she told me abt going to the medium with her cousin, Michelle...   Today, recieved another news of a distant fren from our secondary sch who had committed suicide... this is the second for the yr..life is so philmsy... I hate to hear such news.. it brings back memories that are especially depressing...it kinda pushes me back to where I was 6yrs ago..walking through a forest without any light leading my path, I do not know where I am going neither do I know if I am ever coming out of the forest... where is the start..where is the end... no one can tell me... I was so misunderstood, so alone... I wanted to juz fuck it all and end everything... looking back it's amazing how I can survive being alife.. maybe I am a coward, gutless to carry on the act and finish it...
