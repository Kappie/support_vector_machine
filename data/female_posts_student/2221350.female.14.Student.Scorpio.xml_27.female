She said she would lay in bed and be depressed and that she would appreciate as much time away from me as possible. For a second there I couldn't even move, it was like a big slap in the face from someone you thought wasn't capable of such things. So I buried all the rocks in her zen garden.  You know, the tiny dish of sparkly sand that has pebbles and a little rake to go with it.  The stupid stupid player thingy I put on here is acting up ((already?!))   Bleh, in fact since dinner won't be ready until 7:30 and I'm starving to death, double bleh. It's time to watch wheel of fortune, I am THE BEST player that show has never seen. Maybe it's the whole -SmartGirl- thing, but I can get those puzzles in a heartbeat. of course then i just have to sit there and wait for the idiots on tv to get the answer((QUIT BUYING ALL THOSE VOWELS GODDAMIT! YOU'RE WASTING MONEY! THE ANSWER IS "A VERY SAD CLOWN IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS!"))
