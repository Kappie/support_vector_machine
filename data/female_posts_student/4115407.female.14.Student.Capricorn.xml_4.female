Also alot of people call me mean, i am not mean i just have a opinion like every one else i am not cruel in any way, and people to think that i am, i am also well, im still tryna figure out werid, well i really dont care i mean apparently im not that weird if i have friends and a boyfriend that claims there not weird, lol anyway im not shy either, i hate when ppl say im shy im not shy im just quiet until someone's sparks the conversation, as u can see i dont have the greateset social skills but i can really care less. Another reason is that ppl always think im getting smart, but being smart and sarcastic are two different things, i dont get smart and im not mean i just state my opinion and yea so wut i always got sumthing to say i wouldnt be anisa if i didnt. And it pisses me off or when ppl say me and my sister look alike cause we dont at all and we are nothing alike, ppl think im always mean to her, trust me im not, usually the big sister always has the mood swing problems and gets attitudes with the little sister, well were opposite she always like that 2 me with the attitude and mood swings, but i let her it doesnt matter to me as long as she doesnt touch, cause as soon as she does its over and she cant win an argument well not with me, and if she wont do sumthin that i told her to do i tell my mom yeap ima snitch well im not like that, but with her i have to, cause her little friends got her like that thinkin she grown and that she dont gotta listen, so i tell my mom to get my way, cause my mom already kno how she is, and they is no other way for her to stop unless u hit her hard enough to kno that ur not playin, if she pushes me to that point i have to do that, hey she asked for it. one teacher was Ms. Powell she assumed that i was sum quiet little girl to myself, but she assumed and didnt kno me and misunderstood me and thats her fault 4 assuming. And my dad id kinda like that, he's not around me long enough to find out how i am so he thinks all this stuff, but still i really dont care. And im glad that im "weird" w/e that means and i have karina and shanae to thank, because if i would have hung out with ashley or buddah or any of them any longer they probaly would have drove me crazy with all that crap they talk and then all the back stabbing then look u right in ur face and say im ur friend omg that will drive any 1 crazy. And then my coach, he didnt kno me either, he thought that i was sneaky because i didnt really talk in front of him then with my friends i would and he called me nonchalant, w/e that means i dont feel like looking it up. So as u can c im really misunderstood, oh and after 4 yrs. of negociating ( my spelling is off today srry, cant think) i can finally get my freakin ear pierced, now im not goin another 4yrs. for the top of my ear, nope, im slicing the time in half or sooner, i hope.   Oh any my legs hurt so bad, this working out thing is not cool at all.
