Okay... so, I need to ask him if he plans on going to DMB in August... and possibly offer going together... and other people should go to... like a certain Melissa Louise Morris... because I think she'd really enjoy it a lot!  :-)  I had a pretty good week at work and at school.  Minus the fact that I thought I had a test in math today... but didn't.  I got all mixed up... it's Monday.  So, yay... I get more study time.  I have a midi project due on Tuesday... which will be presented to the class.  I'm going to work on it Monday and wrap it up on Tuesday morning (early) because I have no class in theory... I have a fairly large music theory project due next Thursday, though... that was assigned due to Dr. Balentine's future absence on Tuesday.  I also should probably get my stuff done for lab tomorrow... I haven't written it out yet.  And I have 2 graphs to do.  BLAH!  So, I'm really looking forward to Spring Break.  I just want to be able to totally veg-out and not have to worry about school or work.  I need to talk to Steve next week and see if he wants to go out.  Ya know, Greg offered to give me his number... but my response to Greg was, "it would REALLY freak me out if someone who I knew didn't have my number called me and asked me out... even if I knew them... I would rather them ask me for it themself first..."  He quickly agreed and said he hadn't thought of it that way.  So, we'll see... I'm wondering if he's going to turn me down... I was thinking of asking him if he'd like to go get some dinner after work next week, or go out and do something next weekend to get to know each other better.  That seems innocent enough, and it's very truthful... because we DON'T know each other that well.  I dunno... we'll just see what happens and go from there.  :-D
