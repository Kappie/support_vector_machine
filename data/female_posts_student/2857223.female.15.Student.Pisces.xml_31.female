Too bad Minnesota didn't get past the Lakers, because I HATE the Lakers, and I HATE Kobe, and I don't hate Shaq but think he's not that great at basketball - but I like Karl Malone...anyway, it's too bad that Sacremento didn't just beat Minnesota, and then waste LA, because then it would have been my team the SACREMENTO KINGS winning the Championship! Anyway, I hope Detroit gets LA, because I really want to see them win rather than the Lakers  Although, I guess it wouldn't be so bad if LA won just this year because it would be cool for Karl Malone to get a ring! And maybe if Gary Payton got one he would just retire for crying out loud, and we could be done with him!
