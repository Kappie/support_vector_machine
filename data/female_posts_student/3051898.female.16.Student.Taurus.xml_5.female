I'm dreading the fact we'll probably have an argument to ruin it all sometime soon... I guess I'll just have to try really hard not to get upset by him doing something stupid and also to not start an argument. If I sense an argument coming I must back down immediately!!!  I could tell you the gory details of the time spent with Chris, LOL. Though already the details are slipping from my mind... Also I don't think anyone really wants to know. Actually Louise tends to want to know to reassure herself... hmm. Well she shouldn't get so upset because everything is bound to collapse soon. :(   Its a shame Louise was getting upset today... In fact her crying interrupted Chris' attempt at making me horny (he was horny so he wanted me to be, but I just sorta wasn't... I basically just wanted be cuddled and kissed...)  I think Louise is a little happier now (dunno if she will be after reading my blog) but I felt sorta guilty that I was spending so much time with Chris (but I loved every minute with him!). Unfortunately I was annoyed that me and Chris had to stop... I felt like I was being a really horrible person, but I really did just want to stay with Chris and keep kissing and stuff. I wanted Louise to be happy, though. She was so upset I did recognise that cheering her up was important.... Even if it did make me feel sorta frustrated to have to jump off Chris to go look after her.   I liked the discussion we had about marriage... Me and Chris actually discussed the idea of getting married! LOL!! Nah don't worry I don't mean we decided we were going to get married or anything like that...  If we are both still together and happy in the years to come then marriage is entirely possible. He even pointed out that technically we could get married in two years time! I did mention that we would be too young then, but then later on he mention the fact that we could in 2 years time again.... Perhaps he's hinting he would like to marry me? LOL, I realise that he was just mentioning it cuz that's sorta scary. It scared me anyway.  He seemed to want to discuss the future a lot. It seems his life plan includes moving to America (something I've wanted to do for years), living in a big house so friends can visit (a great idea!), owning 2 dogs or possibly a dog and cat (he said 2 dogs but then he knew I wanted a cat so said a dog and a cat so now I don't know what the plan is), being really rich (this has always been a life goal for me actually), and having kids (I've always wanted kids until more recently when I've thought it would hurt and it would make me feel old). In fact he wants a boy and a girl, so 2 kids. Sounds reasonable to me. Actually when we were discussing it later on (when Louise wasn't in the room) he even asked me what I'd name my kids! I'm beginning to think he would like us to have children together.... (don't worry Louise, we won't get this far... I bet we'll have that terrible argument that breaks us up for good any day now :( )   I should be happy. I'm not smiling though. I think I feel guilty cuz of Lou. I think I feel sad that Louise and Alison are sad. And at the back of my mind I'm concerned for Rachel. And I miss Lauren (I hope she's having as much fun in France as I am here when I'm with Chris :D).  Apart from those things, I'd say my life is great at the moment. Things have never been better with Chris, and I'm not arguing with my family (having a tidy bedroom helps). I really wish my friends could all be happy. Although it certainly seems like I'm very preoccupied with Chris, I do care a lot about them.... They're all really important people to me. Please can you guys just give me a hint how to make you happy? (hopefully without stopping me and Chris enjoying ourselves)   I feel I've written enough to keep Louise depressed for a while. She really shouldn't read my blog, it's bad for her health. With any luck she'll concentrate on me saying how I want her to be happy and how I care about her asI do all my friends.   Btw, you probs guessed but my mission to stop talking about Chris has been failing really badly. Perhaps I'll succeed more on holiday (I leave Saturday for 2 weeks, sono blog updates for ages). I'll let you know how it goes (if I remember).   Bye for now!  ~Hannie  xxx
