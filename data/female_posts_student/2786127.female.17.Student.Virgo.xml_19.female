My stomach is getting tied up in knots My brain is yelling at me "don't talk to him he's a jerk you dumped him for a reason stop being nice be a bitch be bitch" and yet I'm sitting here having a conversation with him. What is this.  ARRRGGGGGHHHHH why do i do this....he has to leave right now but he says he'll be back in a half an hour and we can talk...I need to go to BED because i have school tommorow and yet here im going to sit and wait for him to get back. I'm SO DRUNK when im tired... this is ridiculous. And here i sit...i'm going to go read. or something. sit and wait. twiddle my thumbs because im pathetic. PATHETIC. go to bed.
