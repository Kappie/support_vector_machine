So I spend inordinate amounts of time trying to thim of what it was, but, alas, no succes.  so stayed up til 12.30 talking to him, but still... nothing.  At which point I go, "SHOOT!  it's past midnight!" and I scramble offline and into bed.  but then I realize!  oh no!  commapps speech!  so I scramble up and I practice.  and I stay up til 1.30.  by which time I'm about ready to just drop to sleep right there.  then I got up at 7.30 this morning so I could go pick up my yearbook and not wait in those horrendously long lines.  so I was at school by 8, so I just breezed through yearbook pickup.  =)  man.  yearbooks are so thick.  and SUCH an ugly cover.  geez.  all of rice's were better than THIS.  and then commapps... I got a 95 on my speech.  I am never practicing for a speech ever again in my life.  my shoes were killing me, too.  god.  commapps is just so horrible.  so now I have no more stress this week!  just tomorrow, art project due [no biggie], the a FUN-FILLED WEEKEND!  =DDD  which means I'll hafta finish [or at least do most of] my life lesson book tomorrow, and tonight I'll have to go get a shawl.  joy!
