OH and of course the MASSIVE poster of charlie in dare magazine looking AMAZINGLY sexy, and the pics of him in sneak wearing NOTHING but his swimming trunks *SWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON* did help...an awful lot. thnks to nazrene who found them :-D  so anyway. there we have it. the end of 11w. i guess i cant really say 'rock on 11w' anymore :'( but i can say I LOVE MY FORM, and i shall see all of you amazingly coolio people in september, even if we're not all together. acually..i guess i'll see some of you over the hols :-D  11W ROCKED!!!HARD!!!
