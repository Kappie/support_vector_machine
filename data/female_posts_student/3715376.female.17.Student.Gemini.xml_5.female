Sunday, 4th July: We figured out the car trip to Austria would take around 14 hours... so logically we would leave at 7pm that night and arrive 10 the next morning. Yes, with 5 people in the car plus baggage and a whole night in the car, we were all looking foreward to the long drive ahead... need I point out my sarcasm? No, it really wasn't so bad really... of course, me being the ever impressive exchange student ended up stuck in the middle seat for most of the trip, but well, despite the fact I had next to no sleep and I was stuck in between Christian with the pointiest most triangular shoulders in the world and Anne who wouldn't know the words 'move-over-your-squashing-your-poor-little-exchange-student' if they came up and bit her in the nose!So after being sat on, poked by pointy shoulders,a long long time, I was rather looking foreward to the end of the journey. However, therewas one highlight of thejourney. Let me tell you, theres nothing likewatching a German sunset at 4 am squashed into the back seat of a crouded car... unless of course you count sleeping, which isin fact what I was doing as the sun came up. I guess all that lack of sleep finally caught up on me! Which brings us to...      Monday 5th July: Afteraround 12 hours in the car, we stopped in at a truckstop for some 8am breakfast. We were all tired and grumpybut thaks to my 'Rotary Plastic Smile' I managed to come out of Breakfast without biting anyones heads off. So I atre some joghurt, bread with cheeseand some with nutella and had a hot chocolat. There was a huge toy kanargoo in the corner. Over breakfast Christian enlightened me as to why Danish people dont like German people. I had known about this fued for a while, but I never knew where the arguemant had actually sprung from. 'Well,'explained Christian, 'Its because they're all big and fat and smell like sausage.' Hmm... yes very good explanatin indeed... but I guess itsat about the same level as the why Aussies dont like New Zealanders orTasmanians. And just to prove his point, the very next person to walk past our table was indeed, as Christian had said, a big fat German... andyes, he smelt like sausage, but then again hewas the chef of the cafe there so I guess he had an excuse... Sowith wide, bright eyes and cheerful faces all round, we willinglysquashed ourselves back into the car for the last leg of our journey... only 2 hours thank goodness!        So we arrived in our little Austrian town, I can't remember the name of it butit was very close to Salzburg, where The Sound Of Music was filmed.We were to stay in a 3 storied apartment type thing with three floors,and we had booked the 2nd and 3rd floor of it, as another family (friends of Neils and Marienne) would also be joining us in austria. We arrived at 10 but we werent supposed to check into our rooms before 3. We couldn't find anyone who worked there around so we just waited and walked around for a bit.The apartment thing was on afarm thing. Also on the farm was alittle herd of deer, some rabbits, some sheep and 2 goats (one of which bit me, lol). An hour later at 11am the family, (Henerik, SÃ¸ren, Lars and Nies) arrived, along with the land lady of the place. So we unpacked, socialised, played table tennis (at which i lost badly) ate a BBQ for dinner and then caught up on some much needed sleep!    Tuesday 6th July: When Niels and Marienn          To be continued, will get some food nowcause I'm hungry)
