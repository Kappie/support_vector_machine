Now I believe I've listened to the damn song more than 100 times and I still love it. Is it the guitar? Or is it Jaheim (who sings the chorus) or is it the Nelly I've missed? LOL.   I'm off to work at 5pm. Guess what,  I finally got my period today . Just a little but still I got it. I'm freakin' relieved. Now my stomach hurts like hell, but at least I know there's nothing weird going on with my body.
