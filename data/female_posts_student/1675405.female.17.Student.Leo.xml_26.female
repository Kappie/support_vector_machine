Heather and Wade were talking, and Heather is going trick or treating tonight with him and his nieces. I don't know why that bothered me, but it did.   It's not really that I'm jealous; that's only what an average bystander would think. I guess I got to thinking about how I would love to get asked by a guy to do something like that. Maybe it's just me being upset about Sarah asking me why I don't have a boyfriend. I don't know why. Is it that the boys here at Jefferson are already taken, and the "leftovers" are the cream of the crop? Or is it me? Do I have some sort of personality quirk that people find annoying? Am I monsterously ugly? I just want to know what.   I was watching a Baby Story this afternoon, and I felt sad. At the rate I am going, I'll never get to that point in life. That just makes me feel really sad.
