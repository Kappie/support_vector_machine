I'm so happy!!!  I think I figured out why I'm in such a hyperish/cheerful mood (I am using EXTREME self-restraint from typing all of this in ALL CAPS).  I have ALL this caffeine and suger  surging  through me. Just surging around in my body, slamming around in my veins and stomach or wherever the heck it goes!!!!!! WHOOOOOOOO!! Yeah, that has to be it. I'm am super hyped up.  HORRAY FOR SUGER AND CAFFEINE AND MOUNTAIN DEW IN PARTICULAR AND BAD SPELLING AND ALL CAPS AND AH, ALKALINE TRIO AND OTHER GOOD CDS I OWN AND MORRISSEY AND THE CASSETTE I BOUGHT YESTERDAY OR WHEVER THE HECK THAT WAY. I BOUGHT A CASSETTE!!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!! I LOVE UHM PASTE!! NO I DON'T LOVE PASTE I LOVE...AH...TISSUES!!! SOFT TISSUES!!! ALOE OR LOTION TISSUES!!! AND CEREAL!!! SUGARY CEREAL AND HIKES UP MY MOOD LIKE THIS!!! I LOVE CEREAL! YES, I DO, I LOVE YOU TOO! BUT MOSTLY CEREAL!!!  I have to go back to my homework again. I hate myself. I hate homework and school. And having to wake up in the morning. Except I eat CEREAL in the morning so I ALWAYS look forward to THAT!!!
