It got me thinking about the  urlLink Random Act of Kindness movement  and I found some of their hints online.   urlLink Ideas for Individuals and Groups   They even have monthly calendars with an act for each day especially for classroom use.  Do you want to make a difference in the world?  Do some small kind act, anything at all, for someone today.    More to come...
