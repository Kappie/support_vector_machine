I came here ealier than I expected so I am writing my dirary with Notepad program. I will copy this to my web dirary. It will take a long time 'cause It's now 11:34am.  I should wait until 12:10pm to use internet and also meeting Jay and my ex-teachers like Denice, Adam, etc. I was at Starbucks coffee shop this morning. However, I was so bored. Therefore, I decided to walk instead of sitting at the coffee shop. I walked and visited some store which is Artists' Material near the Wellesley subway station. I bought some material of drawing for Jay. I know this is not a specially day for her. However, I want to buy some gift for her birthday which is 30th Dec.  This is too early but I am pretty sure that she might be happy when she get those. I will not be able to buy a gift at her birthday so, I bought those today. Nowadays, I have enough money to live several months.  I know I have been working St. Lawrence Market and I can earn some money from there. But, I am not too sure I will be able to have enough money for buying a gift on December. Anyway, Now, I am in NCA and I have been waiting her. I want to visit the AGO which is Art Gellery of Ontario.  Today is Wed. which visit there for free. I heard that every Wed. we can visit there for free. Actually, I really want to see special exhibition which is about impressionism and we also have to pay for it. Now, Impressionism pictures are showed by the AGO for severl months.  I don't know exactly when the exhibition will be finished.   A few minutes ago, I met Jay beacuse she had to answer the nature call. She was passed by me and then She called me "Billy, What is going on?" and "What are you doing?"  and I said " I'm waitiing for you." ^^ Now, She went back her class. It is almost the Lunch time.   Did I mention that I bought two Whopper for our lunch?  Yes, I did. It will be very delicious to us 'cause we skiped our breakfast. I am so hungry now. I can not wait even the time is 12:02pm now. AHH
