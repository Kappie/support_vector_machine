And I get to eat food in French class which is very good. Wow...the concert is tomorrow. I really hope it isn't a fiasco. Hummmm....anything else to say? For one I sound like I'm talking to myself. I probably am. I don't even know why I wrote this...I have nothing to say but that the snow has melted but it's still cloudy and could rain/snow at any minute. But I am stupid and am wearing sandals. But hey I wore them when there was much more snow on the ground. Well I have to do stuff before i leave this morning so I will be back when I have something to talk about...
