Also, b-ball game with my brother tomorrow night.  Should be enjoyable.  Was accepted into that week-long internship.  I'll be at a local hospital where I spent entirely too much time this past summer...   Found a great  Starting Over   urlLink gossip page !  Gotta love the gossip...   More to come...
