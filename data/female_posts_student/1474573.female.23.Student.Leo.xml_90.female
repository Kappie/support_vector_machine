In fact the first show is at 9:00 AM tommorrow morning at the Union Square theatre... yes....that's what I'm talking about. Matrix:Revolutions is out tomorrow and for those of you still upset at the second one A) read a fucking book(I'd reccomend Baudrillard or Foucault) and B) get over it. I'm not dogmatizing the matrix like it's some sort of manual for life ( If you want to know more about the world you're currently living in , I'd reccommend 1984/Brave New World for THAT.....) The matrix IS a good movie and I think that it at least aspires to bring it's audience up to ITS level then come down to the audiences (Though one might argue that it did do that in the first one).  enough ....i gotta go to bed nite nite new poem in the AM
