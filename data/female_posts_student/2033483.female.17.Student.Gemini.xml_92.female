Don't get me wrong this weeks has had it's high points but I'm the type of person that does well with nothing to do.  This is why I need to find a job!  I was extremely nieve going into the job hunt thinking I could find one right away.  Nope.    A couple of days ago my nephew Alex fell down the stairs at my older brother's house and broke his wrist.  Now, he is in a cast.  He's two-years-old so it's the cutest cast you've ever seen.  But today he took it off some how so my brother had to bring him to the doctors to get a new one put on.    Last night, I went to Lizzie's house and watched Uptown Girls for the third time.  It's still a cute movie.  Some of Mary-Kathrine's friends stopped by and we had a fun chat.  Today, I took my little brother to the mall for lunch and I dragged him into all of the stores he hates, such as Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle, etc.  He's a trooper.  Tonight, I hung out with Renae.  I have finally made it to Wall Lake and the Japanese Gardens.  The Gardens are so pretty.  Oh, and Renae, I agree that Frisbee didn't land behind on accident. ;-)  Later days,  Kay
