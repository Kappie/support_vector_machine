I'm taking Gucci's advice and I'm going to just think about things over Christmas break and see where I'm left in the new year.  Me and Claude have an uber-tight friendship and I honestly wouldn't conciously do anything to wreck it, so all decisions here forth will be made with only the utmost thought put into them.  (Did that sound smart? It sounded smart to me, but I very well could have made no sense....)  Anywhoo, I'm going to be rational, which mean doing the hard thing and thinking with my head and not my heart.  Yea, and I'm done....  Oh and WELCOME LESLEE  to the wide world of blogging... if you can remember you website that it!! ;)
