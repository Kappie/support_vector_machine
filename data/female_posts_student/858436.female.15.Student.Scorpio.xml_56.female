Virginia had Mimi spend the night and Charles was here so I had to "watch them" but it wasn't a big deal. They didn't bother me all night and my parents didn't get back until 1:00 AM. I hate a bunch of chocolate and played music really loud, it was nice.   This morning, none of us wanted to go to church, so Virginia, Mimi, and I pretended like we slept in so we didn't go haha. I'm sorry, God. I hung out in my TV room all day long. I only went downstairs when I had to. Like to refill on Diet Pepsi or something. Then my father called in to El Bracero's so we had dinner from there. Virginia and Charles had never seen "Finding Nemo" and I was extremely appauled. So my mother went and picked it up for us and Virginia, Charles, and I watched it up in Virginia and my TV room. Now I'm on MSN. Virginia tried to type "I love you and I want your sexy body" to a certain guy I was talking to.. hm wonder who that would be.   So yes, my weekend has pretty much revolved around my brother and sister. Today my mother started bitching at me for something, and I barely raised my voice in defense of myself. Then I got yelled at for yelling at her. I tried defending myself again, but she told me not to backtalk her. So whenever I try to defend myself, it's backtalk, but she is more than allowed to bitch me out. Makes sense. I still have barely spoken to Sam and Mary Ellen. My dad asked me if something was bothering me. Idiot. I swear, the intelligence level is this house is spellbinding.  Enough of my cynical-ness. I don't want my parents rubbing off on me. I am my own person and I don't want to be just like them.
