We placed first in the DMR though my 2:59 800 wasn't much of a contribution, I should have just given my medal to Morgan or Jesee or Melissa, the ones who deserved it. Then the 400...but we don't like to talk about that. The ride home was fun. I got to drive there all by myself. My mom let me use the car. I drove her to the bus to the city and then I drove to New Dorp all alone. It was.... empowering I guess is the word. So then the meet ended and I told Debra, Doofy, and Jenn who had come to watc the race that I would give them rides home. It was an adventure in the least. First we had a little trouble finding Subway, but when we did and were on our way again.. oh man... Doffy's directions were abysmal (SAT word!) so I was like making hard turns and stuff then Deb, Jenn and I got kinda lost from his house. It was so funny. We had no idea where we were goin and I was like stopped at a stop sign for like 2 minutes and some lady beeped at me, then we were driving down a street and some guys in a car beeped at us and that just didn't help the fact that I was freaking out, convinced I'd like broken 10 driving laws or something. Then we put some Dashboard on and that made it all better. Tomorrow I'm takin Ambro and Nulty to the funeral for Lenny. We are gonna go durin the day. I know I don't have to but it's out of respect to all of my friends who knew him. Maybe afta we will all go out together cause it really brings the whole reality to you, ya know? Like, one night your chillin w/ your friends and the next your at one of their wakes. It's like, we really aren't gonna live forever, no matter how much we tell ourselves otherwize. x0x
