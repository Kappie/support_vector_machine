Much better now thou :-) , sadly it took only a gorgeous new bra and a good day of writing at work experience 2 temporarily lift me from my "abject misery"! (Shallow, moi?!)  This morning I hit my parents with the news - I fully intend to stay behind when they depart for "our" holiday in Yorkshire (always fun 2 go somewhere even rainier for your summer holiday!). Even the offer of a free-rein cost-wise trip to Leeds (trust me, GOOD shopping) could not lure me. Holidays, cooped up with my brother and the inevitable increased level of family argument, is not something I feel up to coping with right now, 2 be honest - I'm not feeling v on top of things right now. In fact, I'm very much below them! A week alone at home (actually I've never been "home alone" for more than a day b4) sounded like the perfect tonic for my current hellish mood. Peace, silence, tranquillity (I like 2 use several words 2gether meaning more or less the same thing)... Freedom 2 read, listen 2 music, watch TV/DVDs etcetera, without constant interruption. Heaven....  UNFORTUNATELY, the parents take a different view... "You're in no state to look after yourself" "What about the house? You haven't shown yourself to be responsible enough to take care of it." (No, Mum, that's right. My irresponsibility in occasionally getting home late or losing stuff will naturally, in due course, lead me to burning down the house...) etcetera etcetera you get the picture.  Listening 2 Elvis, ah how I love old rock 'n' roll!   Anyway , hope i can persuade them. At the moment they are saying a firm and definite no. I can stay at a friend's for a week, if i must, but not sty home. Dad even threatened 2 cancel the holiday altogether if i don't go. Yeah I bet that's what they'll do, and then make me feel like shit about ruining their holiday. Yippee!  Moving on...  Wish I could sleep, the ability seems to have left me, odd that. They want me 2 go on some kinda pills or something but guess how sick i am of pills? Very. Literally... The metefanamic acid made me v sick indeed!  "I caught this morning morning's minion, king- dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and  striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstacy! then off, off forth on swing, As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding Stirred for a bird, - the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!  Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!  No wonder of it: sheer plod makes plough down sillion Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear, Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion."  That is my favourite poem of the moment. It is SO DAMN GOOD it sends shivers down my spine! If we had studied poetry like THAT at school more people would have enjoyed it. Not many more, cuz as far as I can make out most people have very little interest in English, but some! Instead of "cultural poetry". Riight. Crappy poetry more like. Well not all of it but most.  Gonna go for now, might post again later if i'm bored
