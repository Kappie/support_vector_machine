I've been feeling frazzled all day today, might have to do with that lack of iron that goes hand in hand with my "special lady time." I should probably take my vitamins. But I got a voice-mail from Shannon that I should call her sister's cell, and Regina was all, "why did Shannon tell you to call? She's already in Humbolt." So something happened with my voice-mail, and I didn't get it for a few days, and I feel lame about missing Shannon and Annie again. But that's why you don't rely only on one voice message to communicate with someone. And I had plans with Melissa, so I got all flustered worrying about having to see Shannon and maybe missing Melissa, and in addition I'd agreed to study with Liz in the morning, forgetting about plans with Melissa. Driving home from Oakland in the morning always throws off my day in Davis. Maybe I'll blame it all on that. Although Jerm made a good coffee this morning. It was somehow different than normal, and better. God, I'm such a space-case. Time to work on my essay about a lingering unresolved issue of WWII. Gotta find some sources tonight, and write something tomorrow. This means much blog venting about WWII, I'm sure.
