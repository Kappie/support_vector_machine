It was soo boring, and soooo long.  It was detail stuff, so we'd run through a scene like 3 times.  With huge gaps inbetween while they decided stuff.  Oh well.  Tomorrow will be a better da..... wait!!????  Tomorrow is THE OPENING NIGHT!! *gasp* I had an interesting day other then that.  Somehow, they all got into telling blonde jokes, which turned into rather discusting, dirty jokes.  Alex is all like, "Okay, I can see where this is going, shut up now."  But nooooo... Braidy STILL had to keep going.  Grow up kid.  Jeff is all like, 'Something about highschool curupts (sp?) kid's minds."  That was kinda funny.  But otherwise, it was very immature and stupid.  After Braidy's bad joke, Amy's all like, "I don't get it!  Tell it to me agian.."  We're all like, "AMY!!!!!!!!!!"  How blonde. But I got to give Robert a hard time, which was fun.  hehe.  I was all telling him how to do his job (he does scenery).  He's all like, "Okay!  You have to guess the lucky number that I'm gonna show to Eric.  And if you don't, you have to get off the stage."  But he didn't really mind I don't think.  And then he flicked me and ran away when I wasn't looking.  But I hit him anyway.   And I found this cool straw hat wit lace on it left over from the wizard of oz, and I wore it all crooked for most of practice.  That's how bored I was.  Actually, it looked kinda stupid.... but what do I care???   I can't think of anything else... soo....   Signing Off- Jack da Mighty, Great, Super, and otherwise
