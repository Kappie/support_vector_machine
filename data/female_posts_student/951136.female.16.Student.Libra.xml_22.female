You are Captain Jack Sparrow, so, of course, everybody loves you... well... not everybody.... actually, a lot of people don't like you... but... damn, you sure are sexy.  With or without the eyeliner.    urlLink   What random made up thought from Pirates of the Caribbean are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    hehe...perfect, huh? :P
