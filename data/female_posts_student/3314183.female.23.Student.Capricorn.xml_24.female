Its not what happens in your life that matters.  Its the legacy you leave behind.  A person's legacy is measured by the number of people he has touched when he's living. Death doesnt end a person's life. It's a beginning as his legacy endureths forever.  Think I've found my dream, my purpose. I'm willing to move, if God would send me.  To the ends of the earth I would go. God if that is Your will for my life. To be a great missionary, to fulfill the Great Commission, I may not preach but I would go. If that is Your voice that I'm hearing, I would go. For missionaries touch hearts and change lives.  To make a difference in the world, even if it means a small difference,  for there to be one, every individual counts. May I be that one.
