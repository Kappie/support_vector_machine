I cry very easily, except when I'm supposed to cry (weddings, funerals, etc.).  In fact, I'm crying right now, cause I just finished The O.C [well at least I wasn't the only one crying...Kenzie said she was too...so there].  Oh God, I'm going to flood the house tomorrow night with Friends.  In the past two weeks ALONE, I've cried over an argument w/ my mom, Gill leaving, a Friends commercial, another commercial (except I laughed until I cried), Jamaican Jews (laughed until I cried...inside joke, don't even try to understand it), The O.C., and the thought of the Class of 2004 graduating.  Wow, that's about every other day!  On the flipside, I get happy really easily - for the entirety of last week, I was happy over getting a newspaper position, being in NHS, and something else that's between me, Katrina and Amanda L.  For example, my sister and I went to the mall to get Mother's Day presents, and I went nuts over the Four Seasons having a lemon scented candle that really did smell like Lemon Zest.  My mother's day present will be awesome - I really freaked her out b/c I came home w/ two Victoria's Secret bags and told her we bought her something for others to enjoy too.  Haha, we bought lotion in Sweet Temptation (other will enjoy the scent).  I also got her tootsie rolls, chocolate/white chocolate covered pretzels, jelly bellies, Reese's pieces; skin conditioner in Sweet Pea (Bath and Body Works), moisturizing soap in Plumeria (" " " "); a berry burst candle from Kirklands that smells just like honeydew and watermelon; four tart-shaped candles from Four Seasons (it's a Yankee Candle store) in Plumeria, Lemon Zest, Juicy Grapefruit, and Chocolate Chip Cookie, plus a bigger candle in lilac breeze that smells just like lilac.  I still want to get her some Hershey's kisses and Altoids.   I believe the embarrassment department is working triple overtime to amuse others with my accidental antics.  Just TODAY, I had two embarrassing and one not-so embarrassing moment (actually more gross than embarrassing).  First was in chem.  To defend myself, at the time I had had less than 18 hours of sleep in three days (28 to date, five days), far fewer than my minimal 8.5 per night.  So, anyway, I was really bored in chemistry, so I started doodling on my left arm (I’m right-handed).  It was quite a work of art, if I do say so myself - there were/was a watch, smiley, mini drawings on my knuckles (a rose, a sun, a peace sign, a heart and a Star of David), and some other stuff on my fingers.  Then I got tired.  The result - I slept through half of chemistry.  I awoke to a beard of silver and blue ink courtesy of my sketches, and a big puddle of drool.  Thank God I got it off before Boswell’s study session (by the way, the test was soooo easy).  The second one happened at the mall, when my sister dragged me away from this beautiful shell necklace with pink beads, and Mike M. saw me. (who wears the pants in our family?).  Third, my sister and I were in Victoria’s Secret, debating whether to buy stimulating body scrub in Vanilla Lace, when I, AS A JOKE, hold up one of the more *skimpy* selections.  My grandmother walks in before I can say anything, and offers to BUY them for me!  I’m not completely sure if she believed me when I said I was kidding. Well, I’ll leave you with two quotes.  Since one is from Bubba G., one’s kinda stupid, but slightly amusing: “Man who runs in front of car gets tired, but man who runs behind car gets exhausted,” and “Opinions are like butt holes - everyone has them.”  The second is courtesy of my mom, and it basically means don’t share ur opinion constantly…got it (u know who u r, the people this is directed to).  I need to go find more tissues.  Later.  Thursday, May 6, 10:15 PM Between The O.C. and Friends, I’ve gone through half a roll of toilet paper, five cups of water to rehydrate, half a bottle of Visine Tears (my eyes get dry after wiping them so much), and three applications of mascara.  I couldn’t even make it to the series finale on Friends - I started crying right at 8:50.  Again, happy tears mingled with sad tears, as the babies were born (“Wow, they have my name!”), the moving, the duck and chick, the foosball table, the plane, Ross having his heart broken just to have it mended when Rachel showed up…it’s the end of an era in great television.  I’m going to miss it sooo much! It’s going to be hard to stay up till 1AM to see Friends on Jay Leno, then Brad Pitt on Conan.  I’m incredibly drained from all that crying, and just from being tired (didn’t fall asleep today though…go me).  This weekend will be worse, cause I have to rewrite my rough draft to eliminate all the stuff about taking over the world, and just analyze why the Party was able to reign effectively over the world (all the fun stuff is going).   For the second time, I'm trying to watch my mouth.  I had a terrible cursing problem in seventh grade, and then I got myself to stop, but lately, it's been creeping back into my vocabulary.  I started a barrage over the thought that I might have lost my Tale of Two Cities study guide and wouldn't be able to make more copies for 3rd and 7th tomorrow.  Wow, how things have changed...I used to pop Dominique on the hand for saying dammit, but now she gives the "the look" and "the point" and the "ur goin to hades" mouthing.  So, if I get upset and start going, jus tell me to shut up (no, Will Cu., that does not give you license to say it to me even more now in the name of "helping" me).  I read something about attaching a rubber band to your wrist, and smacking yourself with it every time you regress, so that you associate pain with the undesirable habit.  Got rubber bands? I may actually have a prom date…my camera.  I might go w/ Mr. Young to take pictures.  It could be cute.  The camera can have a little tissue boutonnière, I could get a nice dress, play some quality blackjack, and still get a few dances in.  However, I’ve been so insistent about not going that I may seem even more spineless if I give in.  Still, I would love to get all dolled up, with the great makeup, bubblegum pink nails, a fancy up-do, the works.  No, I’m not going…definitely not, I’m white as all get out.  Well if I don’t wear a revealing dress…no, no a non-revealing prom dress is an oxymoron.  But it would be nice to maybe get a few dances in.  I’ll keep you posted.  Till I actually make a decision…Later.
