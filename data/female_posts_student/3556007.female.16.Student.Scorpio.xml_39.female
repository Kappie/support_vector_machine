Cassie, Emily, and Michelle ended up having to sit away from Ellen and I because we forgot to sign up for both plane flights; we only signed up for the plane ride back from Germany.  The flight was overnight.  We left on Sunday around 2 pm and arrived in Germany this morning at 9am, and the flight was about 8 hours or so.  I tried to sleep some of the time, but it was really hard.  I sat next to the aisle, then there was Ellen, and then there was this Julie girl with our church from UT (I never figured out exactly what was going on with her the whole trip -- she just kind of seemed there for the ride or something) on the other aisle.  Everyone was just walking around during the flight, but I stayed seated for a lot of the time.  Ellen and I colored some of the coloring book pages that I brought for the ride with the new markers and crayons that I bought on Sunday morning with Cassie.  Then a bit later, Cassie came to the front and colored Beauty  the Beast pages with me too! :)
