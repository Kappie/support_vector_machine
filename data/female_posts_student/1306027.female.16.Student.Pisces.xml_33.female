It should save me from the mass stoning I could have quite possibly received from my 2 loyal fans (I love you guys. *eyes get moist*).   Stay on the road you nut!  You see, I have the slight tendency to stray from the middle of the road. The story is set in my general area. It's more like a series of stories, but you know if I didn't have to explain that I could actually tell the story.   Practice makes perfect-right?  Wrong. I'm terrible, I admit it. Driving is a totally new experience to me. It also happens to be a totally hilarious experience too. Observe:   The Vacant Parking Lot  The beginning of my training occurred in a vacant parking lot. There wasn't anything really funny about this part, except for the turns- I have the tendency to take turns a little speedily. I was going maybe, 15mph, and my dad acted like I was taking it at 50mph. Haha- dad's gotten more then one gray hair out of this experience.   "Graduation"  "What? ARE YOU CRAZY", yells my little brother affectionately from the back seat. My dad decides to set me loose on a back road. "Just close your eyes-you'll be fine" my brother tells himself in the back seat. I am forced to drive 30mph. That's really fast when you haven't drove that fast before. I do ok. Except for that turn into the neighborhood. TIP: You can't take a 90 degree turn into a residential area going 35. It doesn't work out very well. "Are we alive?" "Alex, shutup." We make it home fine from there. But then there was *HUTTAH* Part two. *You hear what sounds like thematic elevator music.* My mom takes me out driving Sunday. I say- hey let me take over for the rest of the way. I put the fear of God into my mother that night. When I looked over, she was turning a ghostly shade of white and looking a bit nauseous. She was hanging on to the handlebar like a senior citizen yearns for a bedpan.   "Meghan, the speed limit is 50, you can't drive 30. People are starting to line up behind us."  So I drive like a granny. I can't help it! I value my life to much, got stuff to do you know? Yesterday was my first roasd trip. Rural road trip that is. We drove out to an obscure little town and back. I'm getting better, I even drove the speed limit on the way back! It's hard to stay in the middle of the road though when you drive a big huge van. I was slightly sticking to the shoulder to much and my dad had to say "Stay in the middle, Meghan", about every 30 seconds or so. We stopped at a gas station to get a sandwich, and my dad told me I was doing good. "You can tell me the truth you know" he just laughs. "I'm serious" he says. On the way home he tells me about his teenage driving experience. We made it home in one piece. Not to mention we racked up an hour of driving while we were out.    So.  My brother asked to be excluded from all further driving lessons, lol. I guess he values his life to much too. hehe. My mother is a little resistant to take me driving again, after all- she grays faster than my dad. Me? Driving is all right, I just can't wait to drive something smaller. I'll be ok when I drive something much smaller.
