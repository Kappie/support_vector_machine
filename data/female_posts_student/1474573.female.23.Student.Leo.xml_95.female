Loud enough to flip us over Me in you hands on chest fucking to my new rhythm touching my womb jealous you’d never been born    * Note: This relates to the story of Lilith who was Adam's first wife.As the story goes, Adam kicked her out of Eden because she wanted to be on top during sex. After he kicked her out, Adam asked for a replacement and God said that he'd have to sacrifice a part of himselfand that's why God made Eve out of Adam's rib.    urlLink more on lilith
