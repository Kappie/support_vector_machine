First, the ball with Mark started to roll, then he asked me to grad, then it was time for Base Camp and just today I read my acceptance letter for ODS. It's been a great week, I must say.   I'm really excited for Outdoor School. Apparently there's a 2km run involved and I'll bet you any money that I'm going to die, but that's ok. I need a change, I need to get away. I feel kind of bad for leaving Mark there alone for half the year, but I'm not going to not go because of him. I mean, I like him and everything, but I don't want to regret that I didn't go because of a guy.   I hate how much I like him. But it's kind of nice knowing that there's someone out there who likes you for you. Ashlee was right, I've gotten a lot of bad apples, but Mark is definitely worth the wait. He's funny, sweet, nice and he doesn't pressure me to do what I don't want to do. What more could I ask for in a guy? Sure, he's 6'6", but you can't have everything right? Heh. In any event, he's awesome and I'm sure that he'll be all I'm going to be writing about in here for the next little while. I hope everything stays good and nothing goes bad. I suppose I shouldn't worry about the outcome and just enjoy what I have now, but I can't help it. I'm going to take Ashlee's and Sara's advice and just let him in. I don't want to get hurt, but I can't go through life with my guard up constantly. I won't push him away, but I won't let him take over either. My morals and inhibitions won't walk out the door when he walks in because I'm stronger and smarter than that. Sigh. He makes me smile.
