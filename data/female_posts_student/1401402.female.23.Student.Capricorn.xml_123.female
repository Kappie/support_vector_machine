Because my eye balls need some oxygen, it needs to breathe. I thought to myself DAMN I AM BLIND. My doctor proscribed me a pair of glasses.   Here I am at work, my first day without contacts and my first day at work with glasses on. I’m thinking whats next rite?  People left and right stares at me with a furious thought running through their mind.   I guess it really didn’t matter what people think as long as I like it. Well, do you like it Sakdary? Gee, I dunno. I think I look sophisticated, and much much more mature and all grown up. What do you guys think? Dorky huh?
