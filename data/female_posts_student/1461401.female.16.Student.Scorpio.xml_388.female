Oh be still my aching heart, and the lack of internet. It's been interesting. I couldn't really tell you what  it  is as I'm not quite sure what  it  is myself, but let me tell you, it's been interesting. I think I mean life. I don't know. I just feel like there ought to be something I'm doing right now, some emotion I'm supposed to feel, but I really don't know what that would be. I think I need to go shopping. That always makes me feel better.... god that makes me sound like such a ditz. Oh well. I feel bizzare. Lacking. Like I missed a step somewhere, or never quite got a certain set of intructions. I'm totally repeating myself, but I'm not actually saying anything that really makes sense.    My aunt and cousin from new york are here. They're fun. I want to go to bourne identity, it looks good. It's 11 o'clock, and the men who are supposed to be working on the porch aren't here yet. I have a cd here that isn't mine  That's the news, you stay classy BG.
