Anna and I have all our classes together this semester. First, we have Combined studies: English, then Combined studies: ancient history, next up is Latin followed by band. We have D lunch, this would be bad, but we are allowed snacks in Latin. We have an interesting mix of people in our combined studies classes, and I think it will make for a very, very interesting semester. So, in first period, we have Mr. Hodges-he is really cool in that he treats us like adults. For second period, we have Mr. Schnietman-he is really into chivalry, and then we have Ms. McCarty-she's just really fun. Band is fun, but Doc has this "Celebrate Freedom" or whatever show and that means that we have to have Miss Smelcer, which wouldn't be so bad, but Seth moved all of our stuff out of the newly adopted(for the fall) majorette room so he could put his stupid tuba-that should be at his house so he can practice at night-in there. He made a fuss about it and we got kicked out. Currently, we have no place to put our baton cases, which presents a problem b/c we buy our own equiptment-which isn't insured and cost a lot of money. We can't put them under the table b/c someone will get into them and break someone or something; we can't put them in the guard room b/c we wouldn't be able to take them home. Miss Smelcer doesn't want us putting our stuff in that room, even though Doc said it was ok. So now, it's really gonna suck not having Doc in fourth period. Later on, I started drinking my soda only to find out that I had accidentally been drinking someone else's-I don't know who. I wanted to vomit, but I virtually have no gag reflex. Ah well, tomorrow is another day. buh bye
