How did she get here? How was it possible that she still lived? And it was at that moment Marion realised what the stranger in her dream had meant. It was irrelevent how all these events came to take place - the important thing was to sort out this whole mess.    Already the icy water half-filled the tub. Marion shivered involuntarily as if glacier daggers sliced through her body. She made a move to turn off the water, but her hands were weak from the wounds/ her head light from blood loss. Unable to even stand and get up, Marion reached for the gauze Tittanya had left on a nearby bench. With much splashing nd difficulty, she too managed to cover the wounds and cease the flow of blood.    Fuelled by the wild fires of revenge, Marion ignored the pain and stepped out of the bath. "For my sister," she repeated over and over lie a mantra spurring her on.     The air wa stale and surprisingly colder than the bath, but Marion took no notice. All that mattered to her was to avenge her sister's death .       To find and stop Tittanya.
