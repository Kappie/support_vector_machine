Granted, the title of this thing is stretched across the top of the post page, and it doesn't exactly look like word processing to me either, but it works.  Whatever.  Edginess has never been my forte, but I have to admit it's amusing. It goes back to Jean's (and here I almost spell it "gene," as if I were still hooked on bio) theory about deception and using it to your advantage. I'm not being nice, no.  It's a funny pre-performance routine. I'll go online for a break in practicing, end up talking to someone and realize it's too late to go back and play once I'm done. At least it's consistent.
