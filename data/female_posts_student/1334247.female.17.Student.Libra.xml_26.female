After that, Micki picked me up and we saw Spiderman 2 in Ft. Madison. That theater isn't that bad...I figured it would be very sucky and kind of smelly like butt. But, it didn't. However, when the previews started, the music from the things before the previews was still going on. So, they lost a couple of points there. I did forget about that by the time the movie started. I LOVED IT! Go see it. When we got home, we watched Buffy the Musical, "Once More, with Feeling". I loved that too. I had already seen it, but it was such a long time ago, it seemed like the first time again. I think when I dance, I'm going to dance like Buffy, it seems fun. Then, that night we cooked out and got to see the Ft. Madison fireworks. Those would've been better if my 3 year old niece wasn't laughing and clapping the whole time. She was very loud. I guess it was kind of cute...but only kind of.   I had a funny blonde moment yesterday...Micki and I had to go into the grocery store to pick up hot dogs, buns, and bread. Before we left, Dad said to make sure to get bun length. So, we got to the buns, and I started to say, "We need bun length buns". I caught myself before I finished, but Micki still asked what I was going to say. Yea, he meant bun length hot dogs, and I thought he meant buns. Oops.  Another blonde moment from the day before: I was playing Outburst with Kelly and John and I had the category of cartoon bears. I named all that I could, and I was just thinking of different cartoons. I asked, "Is the pink panther a bear?" Ok, stupid me.
