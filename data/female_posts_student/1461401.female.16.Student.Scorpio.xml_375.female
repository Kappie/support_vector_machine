I'm so worn out, I hardly know what I'm saying anymore. It'd be nice if I could actually think.    But you know what? In one week I'll be in vermont. I leave friday, and I won't be back for two whole weeks! *falls on knees and thanks god* I sorly need this vacation, as much as I'll miss people in town, I just need to get away for a bit. I just need to be able to think straight again.    God damn...
