I walked into my office, and Jill (who I share with) looked up and said to me, “David needs to see you immediately”. Of course, I’m thinking, “Great, what have I done now?”  David is the assistant director of International Programs. As he puts it, “I do the busy work”. I believe that is true to some extent. I mean, the director gets to do all the cool stuff, and the busy work just trickles down. By the time the work gets to me, its usually photocopying, making telephone calls, and basic recruitment. That’s fine with me, its easy work, a lot of work, but easy.   Anyway, David asked me “what do you want to do after graduation?” Quite a bit of out of character for him – being that we have a very professional friendship. However, this conversation was taking on the feel of a “Daddy” talk. We talked about jobs and education, both his and mine, and it turns out we are very similar. Both BGS degrees, both signed on w/ the Air Force at one time (except he actually did it, whereas I dropped), both of us like travel, and both of us hate Valdosta (He went to VSU) It is in his opinion that I should get a job teaching English as a second language, in another country for a year – just to get out of here. Is it really that obvious how much I can despise this town?    Many subjects later and one hour later , his phone rang, to which he said, “I guess I should get back to work”. He returned to what he was doing, and I went back to my office. Jill asked, “what happened??”  I know it doesn’t sound like much, but it is at least to me it’s awesome that I know someone (non-relative adult) out there cares. And that’s all I did at work today!  Then, it was a quick dart over to the theater dept. for a staff meeting on “A Final Farewell”. I’m asst. stage manager, getting some much needed theater experience before I leave VSU. Then, a dart home to change, a dart right back, SAI, then VSO honors concerto. It was a loaded evening.   I’m involved with too much. I need to cut back.    Moving on… it seems that  someone has stolen my credit card info . I wonder if it was someone at work. Among things purchased were 2 TOEFL exams... something that we require our students to take....so I get to call that office in the morning, and get the name of the registered students, and then I’ll run a cross-check against our databases, and we’ll see what happens. I’ll keep you updated.    I just want to give a big shout out to my friends, and thank you guys for being there for me!!! You have no idea what it means to me.     Do not set your heart on wealth... Do not strain to seek increases, What you have, let it suffice you. If riches come to you by theft, They will not stay the night with you... They made themselves wings like geese,  And flew away to the sky. ~Amenemope
