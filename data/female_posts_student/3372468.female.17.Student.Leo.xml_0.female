Everyone in my house can take a peaceful nap but I take one and then people want to wake me up to do stupid crap. Its ridculous on the flip side last night I talked to my ex boyfriend I'm friends with his sister and me and him are still friends it was nice talkin to him catching each other up on each others lives. It was real nice. I told him of my fiancee and how wonderful he is and how much I love him and can't wait to be his wife. I'm really excited about all that. It was nice talking to someone I normally don't talk to but he's a real cool guy I think I'm going to keep in touch with him when i go to college that would be even better. So much as my fiancee and I what to say one minute we're on cloud nine the next we're at each other's throats but I'm going to try something new and see if it works. Hopefully it will. Lately it just seems like everyone i know is getting pregnant. I'm jealous but only a little because I know that I will have my day and until then I have some things that I have to accomplish before I start my family. Sometimes I wish that I could just start my family right now though. It would be nice. At the same time i want to be a little wiser and older I think I'll start having my kids around 22 after I gradaute college. But it's storming so i'm going to enjoy it................
