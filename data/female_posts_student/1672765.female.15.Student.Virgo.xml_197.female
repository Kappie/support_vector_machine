I went with Sarah and Shana to Lynchburg, to the dollar theatre to see Troy at 4  I was too young to get into Troy, and they check IDs so we couldn't go see that  Nothing else good was playing so we...  Went to Golden Corale (can't spell) and ate dinner  Then I got horribly, horribly sick  I started feeling a little better so we...  Went to the mall, with no money  We went to FYE where I felt like I'd pass out  We left after about 10 minutes.  I had taken money to buy a CD but Sarah forgot she needed gas so there went my money for a CD, and the money I was going to be using for the concert Wednesday (but I still have more so it should be alright) (That's not all that clear - I have been saving money for Wed. and I took some of it to Lynchburg with me, to buy a CD, even though I should have used it for the show).  I felt like poop the entire ride home.  We dropped Shana off, and came home  This is around 8, by the way  I listened to quietish music and chatted with Shelby  I feel better now, luckily  I can't remember the last time I was sick    I believe that is all. So no movie today. I could never pass as 17 anyway, even if I lied and said my ID was at home. Everyone mistakes me for a 9th grader just because I'm in the highschool, outside of school everyone thinks I'm about 12/13. I turn 16 in less than a month. Stupid stupid.  If anybody sees this and has the CD "Excuses for Travelers" from Mojave 3, is it worth buying? Please let me know...Also Snow Patrol's "Final Straw" is that any good? Hey, while I'm at it, how about these CDs too... "()" - Sigur Ros "Happy Songs for Happy People" - Mogwai "Rooney" - Rooney "God's Own Medicine" - The Mission UK "Kill Them with Kindness" - The Jealous Sound "Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place" - Explosions in the Sky  I think that's all...I've read reviews and everything but I like to be sure I won't regret buying a CD if I get it.
