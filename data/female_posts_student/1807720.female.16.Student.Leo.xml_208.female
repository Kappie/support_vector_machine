All I could think of was the Flames loss, my Bio test on Tuesday, the fact that the upcoming week is the last week of school, and the fact that finals aren't this week, but one more week from that.  There is so much to worry about.  Friday I spent working on our Drama Final Project, then I went to Mat's and helped Ash and him on their Chem project.  Then I had dinner at Mat's and spent the night with him.  Saturday morning I reviewed a bit of Bio, went shopping (I bought some tanks, skirts, shorts, and two dresses - one of them for the Cadet Awards Banquet Mat and I are going to, which he is going to fall over when he see's me in that dress cause it's hot n' sexy), then I got home, relaxed, and went to a Flames Game Party thing at Ashleys and we had a barbecue and party.  It was fun, though would have been better in the Flames actually won.    This morning I woke up and read over my Bio text, ate a lot - Way too much but I think it's the weather.  The rain is putting me is some kind of I-want-to-keep-eating-mode-even-though-I'm-not-hungry and some sort of depressed state.  Well actually a depressed state until I studied my Bio tonight.  Studying at night is easier than studying during the day.  I feel like I am kind of getting a grasp on this stuff now, and before it felt very foreign.  It's kind of a bad thing though that the game is on tomorrow and my Bio test is the next day - but I will just study in between periods and well partially during the game.  Once I studied during play rehearsals while I was off stage and I did good, so I am not going to miss a game for studying.  I am however going to miss another Flames Game Party though, cause I turned down the offer.  I know that if I go to that I won't have time to study - and quite honestly Bio is more important than hockey.  Bio is going to be my life and career so I better do good.  Anyways, yeah that is what's new.  Tomorrow I going to the bank, the filling up my tank, then picking up Mat for 11:00 AM and going to school a bit earlier to eat and just talk and stuff.  Yeah that's all for now.  GO FLAMES GO!    And I pray to God, For all my effort, all my hard-work help me get through Bio and raise my average.  This is the last week I have to raise my average before the final.  God I also thank you for the amazing and wonderful people in my life.  You know who I am talking about - There's so many!  ;)
