Its none of my business to care what he does but i do, and i can't help it, and it makes it worse that she thinks shes so damn nice and good etc, when shes a bigger cheat than he ever will be, hes lovely and i swear its only sex he wants, and that he wants to say hes in a relationship and no wonder shes bloody tired when all they do is sleep together, go out or something, in fact no don't, rot in hell bitch i should have just hated you for stealing him off me, and kissing him, you stupid tart, you knew me and him were an item yet you didn't need any persuading, cunt.  She makes me so god damn angry, i see her and she thinks she pretty, and special when you cheated on the best person you could have ever got Laura, MARC! And he still cares, in fact i'm pretty sure he still loves you, and another thing bitch, i slept with your boyfriend, ha? How does that feel to know he was with me Monday night, giving me the best sex ever, feel so special now? No, lets hope not, because your not, you think your good at sex too, but from what i hear you use your teeth more than your supposed to be, didn't you know teeth arn't required when giving head? Obviously not... Dumbass, so he can't care about you, he still slept with me and i bet it don't take much for him to do it again, after all me and him clicked and you know it, you'll never compete in his eyes, so what if we ain't together now, we worked, we loved each other and i'm pretty sure things had been different and we would have been engaged, yea, he ain't going to do that to you love, you ain't worth it.   ~Lisa~
