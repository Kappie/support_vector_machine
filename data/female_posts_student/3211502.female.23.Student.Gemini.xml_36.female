Especially, after I had Garth do all the heavy lifting and moving for me when I moved into 20B. But, I wanted to be helpful and, upon hearing that Anita was moving into a 5th floor walk-up, I decided that I had no other choice but to be a good friend and help out.  So, this was quite an adventure. To sum up, in short, not only did I fall asleep in a Uhaul van, but I seriously sweated through all of my clothing. Now, bear in mind, I was wearing a tee shirt and jeans, which are really hard to sweat through. The jeans, especially. Changing later, I realized that I had sweated through my padded bra as well. And that bad boy is thick (C'mon now. To achieve maximum boobage, one really needs a lot of padding). But, in the end, the move was successful. We were able to move all of her stuff into her new place (which is really adorable by the way) and not be too overly exhausted.  Maybe I should start a moving business? Nah, I don't think so. Manual labor isn't for me. I'm more of a manager type. I can delegate. Instead of picking up a piece of furniture, I would definitely be more comfortable telling someone to pick it up, move it, and put it someplace else. Yes, that would work very nicely.
