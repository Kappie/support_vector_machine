Superbabe  Five, six, seven, eight, I can relate Superbabe Don't miss with her kiss Won't duck from a woaaaw! Superbabe  She's got the wild stuff Makes love for good luck Superbabe (x3)  Fame, drugs and money cannot save me Superbabe (x2) It may be pointless to describe her Superbabe (x2)  She's got the wild stuff Makes love for good luck Superbabe Don't miss with her kiss Won't duck from a woah!
