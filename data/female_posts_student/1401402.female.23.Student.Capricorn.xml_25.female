Just last night I went to club GlasKat, back in the clubbing industry again. It was Jessica's 23rd birthday party. She rented out the whole vip room, there was a sushi bar, karaoke room, one open bar, a very big lounge room, and of course a dance floor. I've got in at 11, it was pretty unique everywhere I went there was people I knew since elementary and throw out high school. So basically everybody knew everybody. It was kinna weird, an early high school reunion I must say. It was crazy!!! I dont rememeber exactly how many shots I took. Everytime I run into old friends they would handcuffs me and pull me to the bar. Let me try to remember, three shots of remy, one red bull with vodka, long island, and a sex on the beach. WoW, that was a whole lot for me, I was messed up. Saw my ex-bf from jr high, I was expecting a big hug, but instead we shook hands. That wasnt too bad, I know he hate my guts. Saw Rafael Quach brought back major memories. He had this incredible feelings for me since jr high. I never knew this until after we graduate from high school. I would see him at clubs every now and then, but this boi is so afaird of me for some reasons. I guess I reject alot of greats guys out there. Anyways I didnt see him until twelve and thats when I was fucked up. I went outside with my friends to smoke and Rafael was standing there. All I remember was Sakdary, you remember me? I looked and yelled out Rafaaaaeeeellllllll with a very cheesy smile. Then started puking like crazy. So sorry Rafael I didnt get a chance to associate with you. I realized that when your stressed out about someone you mainly think of that. The more I thought about that person the more puking I did. I threw up so much that security wouldnt let me back in the club. At this point I had to leave. Damn, only two hours of partying for me and I'm fucked up already? Two of my girlfriends had to take me home and take good care of me. I was throwing up the whole way back. My head was out the window the entire time. Got home I manage to take off my clothes, and hopped in the shower. I sat there while the water was running, then got up trying my best not to fall and finish taking a shower. Afterwards I dry myself up and got out the tub and went to sleep in the bath room with just a towel rap around myself. My friends checked up on me and lol I was knock out on the bathroom floor. That was very sad. I was carried and put to sleep and my friends left to 1015. Damn, I ruined everybody's night didnt I? While lying there bed I had this bad bad crap on my left calf. I was hurt so much in pain. This is the part when I really need someone to be with me. Damn, no bfs to call. Poor Sakdary in pain all along. I took two advil and went straight to sleep. Woke up at 10:30 had a hangover. My head was spinning like crazy, I couldnt move, I threw up some more and after all that I was stuck. I sat there thinking what the hell happen last night? Trying so hard to remember who was I with? Who did I associate with? A thousand questions ran through my mind. I tried so hard to get ready and leave the house. But I couldnt even get up. Didnt get a chance to leave the house until 1. Picked my Alyssia up and came home. Play with her for a lil bit then went back to bed by 2. Its 6:46 now, and Cassie's calling my cell like every hour. I refused to answer her call because of what she did to me last night. That was messed up. A friend should always be there for another friend rite? But this Cassie girl left me took off to 1015 with some dude. I was already fucked up but of well. Dont anybody ever expact anything from me ever again. I'm not going to be that nice precious lil thing to anybody anymore. Going to 1015 tonight? I dunno, maybe or maybe not depends on how I really feel. I still feel the handover and bodyaches. If I still feel stressed out by 10 then I'll go but if not I'll be home recovering.
