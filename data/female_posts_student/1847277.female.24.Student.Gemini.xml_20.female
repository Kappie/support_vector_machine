I think I've fallen into a funk.  It happens occasionally.  Of course, I've been a moody bitch for the last several weeks, so perhaps tomorrow morning everything will be sunshine and roses again.  I somehow don't think so, though.  It's partially prelims, which are enough to drive even the most stalwart individual insane.  It's also my addiction to communication and resultant frustration at not having heard from people.  I am 100% a people person, and even though I spend a lot of time hating people (or did in the past), when I don't have close friends around, I go into crazy depressed mode.  It certainly made my first couple weeks in Germany suck a big one.  And this is why sitting in my lonely apartment studying all day every day is not good for me.  Ah well.  So it goes.
