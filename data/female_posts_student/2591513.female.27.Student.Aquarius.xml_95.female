Well I am experiencing that and well it sucks.  I suppose that I should just let things run its course, but our family seems to be growing distant, well one branch anyway.  I don't know how to bridge the gap without buidling another bridge.  I do know that the best thing I can teach my children is that carrying hate in their hearts will eat up at them and cause them grief.  I know this from my own experience.  I carried a lot of hate in my heart for many years and it brought me no joy and made me a resentful person.  There are people I do not like all that much, but I let go of it if someone I care about cares about them.  That is just the easiest way to go about things like that.  Being acrimonious and hateful serves no resolution to anything.  whether we want to admit it or not both stem from hurt.  After all why not hate those who hurt us?  But hating not only makes you less of the person you truly are, it blocks you from the power of forgiveness and the abilty to move forward in life...that is the lesson I at least have learned...anyway, more ramblings of a tortured soul later.
