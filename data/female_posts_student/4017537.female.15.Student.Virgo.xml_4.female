Now, I have the radio on in the kitchen. I got the Chicago rock station in. I would be more happy if it wasn't in the kitchen. I tried to get it to come in on the radio in my bedroom. I'm so happy because I found a bunch of stuff that fell behind my dresser a long time ago today: my hat, chapstick, an earring (that I really missed), and a a Chinese hair stick thing. No one is online now. Ah. I take that back. Denny is online. I haven't talked to him in a realllly long time. Not like I ever really talked to him that much before. Basically all I did was try to keep him from taking his life. He's an idiot. I don't know why he' iming me right now. Ah. so he says "Hey." and so I say the same. He doesn't talk for a while so I say "..." and he says "fuck u." That's nice. I don't feel like typing right now so I'll keeps this short. Not like anyone reads it anyway.
