He was reletively cute, and just happened to be friends with one of my friends, inviting him into our crazy circle. He hung out with us a few times, and all my friends got hung up over how good looking he was in all. I was chasing some other guy, so I really didn't notice. I remember one day, sitting in the library, talking to him, and finding out he used to go to a school some of my friends went too. Apperently he remembers much more about me, like how I'm still the same crazy psycho looney that just wants to have funnn...   So this year, the day before my birthday my best friend took me to a Valentine's Day dance at the cadet hall (My birthday is the 16). Lo and behold, he's there again. Joey is at this dance, looking better than before. On a much needed side note, an ex was at this dance too. He kept staring at me. It was scary. Anyways, Joey just starts looking more and more appealing to me by the second. A slow dance occurs and he and me manage to start dancing. He showers me with compliments, and things from the past. I am shocked. By the end of the night, I am giddy, and swiftly falling for this guy.   Some how he gets my email and we converse. He is very humerous. I enjoy talking to him. A qurk he might have though, is that he isn't fond of commitment. I understand, but do not hear from him in a while. Finally, I see him online the other night, and freak riiiight out at him. I hurt him. A lot.  He calls me today, and apologizes for being an ass. I apologize for freaking out. We talk about all the lovely sexual things...commitment, sex, what is sexy, lies, etc etc...The only thing is, I manage to put across that I am still, magically, a virgen (Some people see my outgoingness and everything else and freak out when I say I'm still a virgen cause I don't act like it.) But I don't think he really sees the reason why I am. It's not like I'm saving it for marriage, or for that "special someone"...It's like I'm just waiting for someone who matters a bit to me, that wont screw and run, and that like..I don't know. My head is swimming with emotions and I don't even know if I'm ready for that next big step in life...I wasn't ready for the first step...
