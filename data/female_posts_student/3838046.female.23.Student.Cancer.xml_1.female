Oh well, guess there's some truth in the strategy considering they won.. or maybe not?  Anyway, my cycle seems upside down now with late nights and all the waking up late.. lost all that regular-early-bird-cycle during internship days (*and it's only been slightly over a week since it ended!!*)  Now it's down to fyp (final year project) and slaving away to the presentation.. trying my best to sound smart and concise. Wonder how the presentation will go and how the mtg with the board of committee members the organisation i am working with will turn out. Betta get my lazy butt back to work... since i will be out with my girlfriend tmr the whole day and partying with her on wed night (*ladies night!*)  Waggy (my puppy) is so entertaining mann... or rather he's self entertaining - playing with all his toys and the house looks war torn, it's as if we have a toddler/child around. Well, must say he is really a dependant pooch.. he even whines outside the toilet when i'm inside answering nature's call... And he's so incredibly cute, using his paw to touch my soft toys and right now he's sniffing ard my room..  Alrighty, must get my lazy butt back to work...and oh yes, the sangria turned out great - manage to salvage the bordeux wine which turned acidic into a fine tasting sangria. =)
