They freaking kicked ass as usual, but the crowd was so shitty. Oh well, the guys did a damn good job, and it was quite spectacular.  So then I had to wake up for kickboxing this morning. Fun. Gah...so much lack of sleep.  And, AIM isn't working. Stupid crap. I should just kill it.  Well, not much else to say. I have sooooo much to do today...suckfest.  Later crazies!
