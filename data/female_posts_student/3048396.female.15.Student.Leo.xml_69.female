I guess I do know people read this now and I almost wish they didn't cuz this is where I let my feelings out and stuff might come out different than I mean it. So don't go off thinking something cuz it might not be right. Okay to set one thing straight...Im not fucking depressed all the fucking time. Okay I DO have a life. Its just now in the summer I want to be lazy so I don't do anything....so don't freak out on me. Gosh. Maybe I don't wanna go out and do something. Maybe I'd rather say here and tan and be lazy. Hmm...what else. I hate when people judge you by just the few things you write...maybe I had a bad day. Maybe you just miss all the good days. Trust me I'll have plenty of good times to write when I get home...so on the 27th there will be something good. Plus then the 28th is my b-day so I wont be depressed. So people would ya just leave me alone. I know how to live my life. Its just that sometimes you get down and if your a woman you'd understand that. You get emotional alot. My mom and I both...so I got it from her. So gimme a break. Err. Some people get on my nerves. And yeah so what if I dont have a best friend from here. I have friends...just not a best one. Heh. I live my life at school just goin thru the day hoping to see all my friends from YC soon. Thats my life. If you don't like it...don't read this. Okay? Heh. Sorry I had tons of anger built up inside...and im not emotional anymore. Getting out and walking and driving tonight took some emotion off me. All the sudden tonight Im super excited bout this weekend and all next week. I can't wait. It musta been cuz Nancy called and talked to my mom bout it all and it musta just kicked in. Granted im gonna be super sad when Howard leaves...I got some of those tears out tonight...but theres no way theres not gonna be any. Anyways....sorry bout this entry...just had to set somethings right. Since some people don't even know the real me....does anyone?...Maybe like 2 - 3 people do. *shrug* anyways...im in a good-ish mood now that I got all this off my chest...I'll write later....
