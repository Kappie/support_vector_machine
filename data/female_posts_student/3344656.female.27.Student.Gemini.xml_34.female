And I've come to the following conclusion.  The songs by Alanis Morissette that I like, I really like.  The one's I dislike, I REALLY dislike.  And I tend to like 1-2 songs per album.  Cases in point:  Jagged Little Pill: "All I Really Want" makes me dance and stuff...  I really like the acoustic MTV Music awards version of "You Oughta Know" but it's really hard to find these days. (I haven't really tried, though)  Under Rug Swept: "So Unsexy" is the only song I like... Musically I like "Hands Clean" but it SO grosses me out that it sort of ruins it for me.  So-Called Chaos: I (gasp) love the single "Everything"  The rest of the album?  It drives me bananas.  I also can't stand that Los Lonley Boys "Heaven" song either.  Please keep in mind, that this is a process for me, and typically once I've made a definitive statement about disliking a song, I usually wind up loving it.  I'm almost finished reading E. Annie Proulx's Accordion Crimes.  It's much like The Shipping News in that I don't like it.  However, 2-3 years after I read The Shipping News, I had an uncontrollable urge to read it again, and I really liked it.  Maybe it's something I have to let stew for a few years?  I appear to not be able to commit to opinions.  Oh well.
