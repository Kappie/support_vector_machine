No...he'll be completely thrown off and freaked out, which I have decided is an 64% chance, and I don't like those odds. I guess some optomists would say that it is also a 36% chance that he'll love them, but... i think i will just give him this one i wroteyesterday:  Just kiss me if you want to give it a try. When I think about you, I think “let’s date!” It would be hilarious, exciting, beautiful. The world would smile at us and we would be able to GET SO MUCH DONE.  what do you think? megan? tania??? (who, if you're reading this, I REALLY REALLY MISS YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!) oh, and, by GET SO MUCH DONE, i mean in a strictly emotional sense...right... NO MORE SADIE HAWKINS DANCE MISHAPS!!! jk...i wouldn't mind. ha! take that, drew!!!  oh. eric, my eighth grader, is, sniff sniff, going to santa fe! i saw his name in the paper about a santa fe summer freshmen league baseball team. i am so upset, but i figure i can still get a bite out of him, or some weird saying like that. Love Will Find A Way.
