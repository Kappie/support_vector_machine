I am incredibly angered with him.  Pretty sure I asked him to prom last week, and he said he would think about it.  That's all well and good, but then today I saw him asking Kristi.  That little poop didn't even have the balls to tell me that he didn't want to go with me before he asked her.  Damn him! So now I'm pretty sure I'm not going to prom this year, and that sucks, because I bought a dress.  Damn him.  And damn prom.  Prom makes me swear.  It wouldn't be so bad, but I have spent a whole lot of time getting this prom ready, because no one else is, and now I don't even get to enjoy it.   Although Mahinda said I could reserve a seat for Grand March, and take pictures.  Still Boo all of Prom.
