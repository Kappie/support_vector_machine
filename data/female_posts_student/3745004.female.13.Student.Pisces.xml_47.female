Like, the type of things that really matter.. the types of things that would get somebody to really think hard, to start reflecting on their inner self and all of that good crap.  Well, you know what?  I'm not.  And that's what makes me so.. so angry at myself. No, I'm not a very deep person! Or, at least, I don't show it or know it if I am.. I'm so unsure of myself. I'll think, "Oh. I realize that I'm not deep. That must make me deep. But wait.. Maybe everyone realizes this, and I just don't know it? That would mean I am in reality shallow. Or maybe all deep people think they're shallow and have the same thought process as I.." It's just.. going in circles. Does that mean that there's something wrong with me? Or does everyone think like this? Am I just trying to fool myself into thinking that I'm better than I really am?  Maybe it's just that I worry too much about these things. But lately I've felt sort of numb inside. Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep, and it's making me hallucinate that I have depth to myself.. or maybe I really am becoming apathic? Is it my tired brain trying to confuse me even further? Well.. I don't know. I just don't know. But, I'm so.. so..  Dull. Empty. I'm like a shell, although I bet I'm not and just wishing I was. At least then I might be at least slightly interesting as a person.  Is it that I think that people actually care about things like this? No, I don't think they do. I'm just whining about my lack of thought like the stereotypical Livejournaler..  *sighs..*  Am I really that shallow?
