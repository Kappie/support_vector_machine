And Alyssa wasn't there, so i was heard... b/c i wasn't being drowned out by her hugely strong voice.  Hmm... so Chad had nothing to do today so he said he'd come over and we could work on the slideshow for Youth Rally.  (Now this is the part where i called it).  So, he said he was going to run to his dad's house, after runing by the music store for guitar strings, and then come over in about an hour and a half.  So.... two hours go by, no call or anything... so i called him.  He had taken a nap, no problem there.  He said he'd get up in about 20 min and leave... so he'd be here in 30.  well, 3 1/2 hours later... no Chad... and no answer on his cell phone.  I knew he fell asleep.  However, for a guy who's already been in 6 car accidents and is 3 1/2 hours late... you start to worry... so i drove over there.  Sure enough, his dad answered the door... Chad was asleep (oh, i called it).  So, to make a long story longer, we looked at his pics from mexico, then he went to subway, then he came over and left about a half hour ago (it's 2:10 in the morning)... ohh... church is going to come so early tomorrow.  However, it doesn't matter... why? BECAUSE TOMORROW IS THE SUPERCHICK CONCERT!!! eeee... okay... so it's not really Superchick, it's the super poppy Zoe Girl... but that's okay... b/c THAT means... less people in line for Superchick merch. once Zoe Girl comes on.  Oh joy... AND we won't be late for youth group... see it all works out... now.. i'm tired... and i'm going to bed.  Goodnight... err... Goodmorning?  It's tired, i'm late.
