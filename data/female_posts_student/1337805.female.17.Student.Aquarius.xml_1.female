So we went outside by the busstop, waiting for him, knowing that if he didnt come today, he was going to come tomorow. He didn't show, so we weren't that disapointed, we knew it might happen. So anyway, lunch ended and we all went back to class. The fire bell was pulled AGAIN, some idiot thinks it's funny. It's not, it's just getting old. Anyways, someone saw my best friend hanging out with my other "friend" Shedevil. I never saw them though, I was playing tag with some people in our class. After school, I went to my friend's locker to wait for her and say goodbye before I cought my bus to go home. My friend came up and told me that my best friend was here. I screamed, and me, her, and another friend ran up to see him. We saw Shedevil in the hall above us. She saw us, and ran away. We ran to her science class, and she had beaten us, and lo and behold, there was my best friend. I screamed, I haven't seen him in a while I was excited. I ran to hug him, cept Shedevil got in the way, shouting, "Don't hug her! She has cooties! No, Lrag, No!" I walked back like, what? and looked at her. I said hi to my friend, and then Shedevil said " Come on Lrag, mom's picking us up to go to my house now." What? I had to leave, I was going to miss my bus. Shedevil ran off with my best friend.  The worst part of it was, my bus was late. I could have run up, and at least talked to him more, and get a hug. But no. The part that bugs me the most though is that she went up to talk to my ex. I'm not sure how, but that REALLY bothered me.  Why I'm so pissed? Shedevil was/is my friend. But she's done this before. I purposelly didnt tell her my friend was coming because I knew she would do this. She always does this. I'm not shocked at all. I'm really just sad that I never got to hang out with my best friend. We're trying to make him come tomorow, but I'm not sure he will. Which makes me madder than hell, because it will be weeks before I see him again - Cadet season is coming up, and almost every weekend involves them leaving for training weekends and such. The next free weekend he'll have, free from cadets (but maybe not from school) is the May long weekend: The weekend I'm in Winnipeg. Happy happy joy joy, I just want to fall off a bridge and DIE.
