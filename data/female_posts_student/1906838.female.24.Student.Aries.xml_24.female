ALL were from guys who had seen the hot pic of sarimah i had posted up.. thinking it was me .. sorry guys. it was just an experiment .. and the results of the trial ( heheh.. the next statement is EVIDENCE-BASED) : GUYS go for LOOKS. well.. not all guys ( i know a particular one who doesnt.. )but MOST guys. goodness gracious me ... ive taken off sarimah's photo from my page. End of experiment.   God.. how much more 'bongok' can these pple be?!!!! I had actually also put my OWN photos there .. the FAT real me .i donno why i donno why some pple are just 'blinded' by beauty they can only see with their eyes but not with their heart and mind.   i have since long ago given up going gaga over the cutest guys .. the reason being besides the fact that they wouldnt take a second glance at me anyways ( unless of course i really look like sarimah), but becos i know , half of these guys probably dont have as much a personality as 'average' looking pple anyways. and most thing is, they will be soo narcissistic about their good looks. haiyoh i can go on and on about this and i have SO MANY GOOD EXAMPLES of such guys whom i know personally.  as a matter of fact, i was just telling my good friend, DR afifah nadia hussin ( oooh.. feef you're a DR now ) yesterday how annoyed i was at a particular so-called 'handsome boy' in my paeds subgroups. i dont know whether it was just me being over-judgemental .. or whether this dude really is a big snob. see.. being malaysian,i tend to like getting to know other malaysians in the medschool.. whether they were here since first year like myself or whether they came in fourth year ( the IMU students). now this particular dude was from IMU .. and apparently he had been in some TV ad back home in malaysia. good looking mmg laa good looking .. but omigod. sombong gila .. there are 2 other IMU students in my group and they are really nice and friendly. but this guy, he gives you very short abrupt answers when u ask him questions and obviously prefers the company of the mat-sallehs.   ok. there ive had my say ... and guys, pls dont be offended. I know some ( well not many but a few) guys who have BOTH LOOKS AND PERSONALITY and not half as snobbish or 'empty'.
