So on top of everyone people leaving, let's be honest: there are people who i just wont' hang out with/talk to this summer.  and it's no fault of their's, maybe it's even a fault of my own...but anyways that sucks.  cuz i really want to keep in touch with everyone i've gotten to know this year.  i'm going to miss all the people who make me smile.  oh wow.  i just read all the stuff people wrote in my yearbook (p.s. i didnt' have time/couldn't find a bunch of people i wanted to sign my yearbook..boooo ) ahhh i wish that there was something that was like school--but not--to bring us all together you know? like school minus all this "learning" nonsense.  basically. i want school lunch. except, school lunch with chipotle.  that would be awesome, and totally plausable too, right? okay. well i'm done with this depressing entry...go be happy about summer guys!
