It just talked about the different positions are in sorroities and how when you get a "Big Sister" you can be very easily disowned by them. Say you don't spend enough time maybe pledging for a position in the Chapter, then they can say they don't think that they are dedicated enough and disown them. I can't say that this is a very interesting part of the book that I have read so far.               I think that the author told us this story because he wanted people to see that something as small as a butterfly can hold so much beauty. We take things for granted and kill of things that aren't doing anything to harm us. Butterflies are beautiful creatures that actually bring a lot of people hope and inspiration.
