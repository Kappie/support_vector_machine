I never knew the things you could hear - The birds singing, foot steps on your porch, rabbits hopping, the keys on the keyboard, rain drops hiting the roof, peoples real voices, music, water dripping, and so many other things. Some things I have no idea what they are because I've never heard them until now.  I'm lost. The Audiologist said it would take over 6 weeks to really figure out what I was hearing because my brain is use to a silent world that doesn't exist. What's so funny is, I didn't believe her. I figured everything would be the same but the fact I could finally hear people talking to me.   I'm actually afraid to wear these in public infear of hearing all those rude comments from people due to my size. I'm not stupid, I knew they always made fun of me but I had one advantage that they didn't know about - I couldn't hear them.   However, the one thing this whole thing makes me realize. I truely do need help but the thing is I don't know what kind of help nor do I know who to ask.
