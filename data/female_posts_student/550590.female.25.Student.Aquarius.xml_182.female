I would put a link here, but I don't want to condone that kind of delinquency. :)  My computer and I are in a battle that apparently is resulting in my having to replace my motherboard. All so that I can play the Sims over and over again until the new game comes out in September.  On an upnote, after tomorrow I will have hopefully learned two more A's, thus maintaining the surprisingly rare UCF Social Work 4.0  This time next week I will have just returned from visiting Thomas and Christy.
