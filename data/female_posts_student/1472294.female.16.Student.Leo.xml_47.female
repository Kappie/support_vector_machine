Maybe to somebody it is short or vice versa, but I, The Person Who Hates Maths, I REPEAT, HATES MATHS, it really kill mi when I am having 2 periods of maths early in the morning. And unfortunately, I started off late (did I tell u I missed maths when I went 2 e dentist yesterday morning ^_^) and I did all the exercies VERY VERY slowly... Even my partner was "ahead" of mi so many que away. :~ BUT, 1 very good news, I passed my (sub) PHYSICS test. Yeah!!! ^_^ That was the only good news.  THE VERY BAD NEWS: Chinese Prelims 2morrow and I hav only revised sec 4's bk. while the sec 1's bk is on my lap and the rest(sec 2,3)? On my study table, UNTOUCHED. I am begining to fear my chinese prelims although I always did quite well in this subject. What is wrong with me? Arrrggghhhh.......
