So I hope that India does, because I don't want to be in Ann Arbor this winter!  As everyone has pointed out, the semester post-prelims usually sucks because you're brain-fried and burned out.  So dealing with a full load of classes is not what I want to do, especially when there is only one class being offered that I would be really interested in taking, anyway.  Actually, I've pretty much had it with taking classes that aren't directly relevant to my life, but I know I have at least a couple more to look forward to.    Ack.  I don't want to go home, but I have to do laundry today, and I obviously need ot be at home to do that.  I have to do more reading for prelims tonight, yay.  I suppose that's pretty much all that's on my agenda between now and the 24th.  Hopefully I won't go totally stir crazy!!!
