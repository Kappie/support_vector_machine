Considering I've lived in the great state of Ohio since the day I was born, it is kind of disappointing that this is only the second time I've hit the big fair. No worries though, as was last year, it was a lot of food, fun, and animals. The Clydesdale horses were still my favorite part of the fair. They are such majestic animals. Whenever I get married I want my groom to arrive on one of those! So yes, in addition to that there were chickens and ducks and sheep and pigs and dairy cattle and beef cattle. A regular petting zoo out there. I didn't pet any of them though, because I was too busy gnawing on a corn dog, cheese on a stick, and a DEEP FRIEND TWINKIE. I am sure, absolutely sure, that I am going to die three years prior to plan now. And we also hit up a few rides, the classic ferris wheel, the Crazy Mouse carny rollercoaster, and the Magic Carpet ride three story slide. If the Deep Fried Twinkie wasn't going to kill me, the Crazy Mouse surely was. I think the best part of the whole fair though was being part of the parade. That's right. We weren't planning to be part of the parade, but as we watched we saw an oldschool fire truck at the end of the parade with a little ledge on the back. And it was moving kinda slowly at the end of the parade queue... so we just hopped on the back and started waving to people! I think the consensus was that we were giving young people a bad name ;) , but whatever. Hence, Donny, Aaron and I were part of the parade at the Ohio State Fair this year. You betta believe it.  Finally, I got my handwriting analyzed. Well, not really. I got a fake-o printout of what my handwriting says about me. Read it, and try to tell me it doesn't somewhat describe you too.  Personality is SO very ambiguous. After all what is it but an attempt to oversimplify the human condition. Anyway, here it is:   You have an extraordinary sense of humor but it is also unusual and not always fully understood. You have a provocative nature that could cause problems with those of the opposite sex. Your fear of rejection is greater than your fear of success.  (WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?)   You are naturally dominate but you can be led by the right person. You sometimes talk when you should be listening. Your charm and personality have won you many friends. Among people you know, you enjoy being the center of attention. You enjoy the challenge of a good contest or game.    All for now. I got SO much to do before I leave tomorrow. This *might* be my last blog for a while. Take care all.
