Haha.  At first when we walked past the corridors in the school, it was like so serene...cos all the students all watching tv...then we came in and disturbed the peace. Lol. Anyway, Pat and Dior introduced us then the rest of us just sit with the children and say hi. You know, they all look very normal, just like u and i [except for a few]...so cute and adorable :) They're so friendly too!! All started waving at us and smiling and all. After we settled down, we each picked 1 child each...me and limin got 2 super funny children. One was a guy one a gal. The guy ar...so funny...everytime talk about b-i-s-h-a-n, t-a-n-g-l-i-n, lorong 6...p-u-n-g-g-o-l and all the places in Singapore...keep asking us to spell them...then keep rattling about ez-link card. When we taught them origami, he said he wanna fold ez-link card. Then i asked him wat is it for, he said so that he could travel to all these places. Weird. But the way he says it...i laugh until like xiaO...then his fan seems to be mr. bean...haha...damn funny lar he. Then the gal ar, suddenly burst into laughter one...when mr. bean says a joke...so funny...i laughed till i cried then mrs. chen took photo. *bleh* Anyway, after origami we sorta lost track of time then had to play games. Played some running game then jacob's ladder. Everyone was having fun and i was re-living my childhood days! Thank goodnesss we're going again soon. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...and of course, we took less things for granted. The children so cute and lovable...when we waved goodbye, it was quite sad. Sigh. Received an unexpected sms today...haha...ask me whether i going to the casual concert or not...but i not going...hope he's not asking me out...oops
