Dais Games  is supposed to be easy for me to write, considering I have the personalities down to a fine art, but it's driving me insane.        I already know that there aren't many people reading it yet, and I should probably post it on another site as well to get it circulating a bit. I, however, don't think I can.        At first I just thought I was writing this for me, but now I feel obligated to write for others.        I don't like this pressure.        Kurama: You started it, why don't you finish?       Baka: Refer to the above.        Kurama: You're always complaining that you never finish what you started. Now is your chance.        Baka: I know, but I don't like all this pressure.        Kurama: 'Pressure turns coal into diamonds.' You can work past it.        Baka: Yeah, I guess you're right.
