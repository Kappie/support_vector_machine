CALL ME! so i dont have to do my homework!  I had a sort of intense day. This morning was good, i woke up at dylans house and went and crawled in his bed. I love doing that. Its so... satisfying. OH WAIT! i already told you all that. Since i have no life and all i do is write in my blog and i feel so ugly that maybe i should go to an ugly home. You know... where the horrendously fat (connor) and the horrendously infected (mandy rose and stevo) and the horrendously ugly (morgan) people go.  And i found out my friend is a smack junkie. Which is intense. I dont know what to say to her... if i tell her to quit obviously she cant...i dont know what to do...  Then my mom made me work and clean her car. And do yardwork. Poop.   I LOVE DEVON! she stayed up all night getting ready to have a party at her house for her friend tana, and then she stayed up all night cleaning up. Shes seriously like, the most generous/gorgeous/amazing/caring person i know. And i love her for it!!!  ugh. losing motivation to write.......  bleh.     ~abby
