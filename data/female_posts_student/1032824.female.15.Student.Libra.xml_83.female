Have you ever encountered a specific point in life whereby this huge change occurs in yourself you don't even realise what you're doing, whether or not it hurts your friends, family members or even yourself? sometimes, you're doing it because it provides support for your ego and sometimes you stay in that position out of sheer inertia because others expect it of you.   I hope that no one hates or holds a grudge against me. cos nobody is truly perfect. ultimately humans will never be perfect, maybe 99% but not 100%.  Just like a diamond, i hope i will be polished into a better person...
