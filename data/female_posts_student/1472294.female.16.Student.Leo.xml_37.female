Oh, my night-crawler.... *__*    Your ideal mate is Nightcrawler.  His appearance may be a bit off-putting, but his heart and personality more than make up for it.  He is shy and isn't very sociable and comes off as a bit of a loner (but you'll fix that).  He is also devoted and strong, and he always seems to just *pop* up whenever you need him the most. : )    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate?
