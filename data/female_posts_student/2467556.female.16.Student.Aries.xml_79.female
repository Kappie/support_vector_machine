Spy Museum i bought this camera that looks like a COKE CAN!!!  Its so wicked awesome!  I finished my vacation gift shopping for people today, i hope all you kids like your gifts if i got you one! oh crap, i just remembered that i have 2 more people to shop for!  oh well, i'll get them in tomorrow.    In other news, i saw this really hot lacrosse player when i got off the metro.....and we made eye contact and all that and i winked at him.  Of course he grins and is all showing off with his lacrosse stick thing after that! it was so much fun!!!!  hehehe, the metro totally rocks!  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
