N it cost $50 to open to open it (my 3rd time liaoz... guess the locksmith is already my friend)... all he did was slit in a piece of paper into my door... n applied some mass X acceleration... a few pulls n a few pushes... the door got opened (realised how vulnerable my house is to the theives)   wx, so sori abt today... really wanted to go out with you... but i stupidly put my keys inside my house when i was talking to you on the phone... N thanks for tolerating my carelessness... hehe...   dayima, thanks for talking crap with me on the phone when i was trapped outside my house... not knowing what to do... thanks ^__^     ~When you come to the edge of all the light you know, and are about to step off into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing one of two things will happen: there will be something solid to stand on, or you will be taught how to fly...~
