So now am I not only injured from the car accident, I am sick with a cold as well. This is what I want to happen on the day that my paper is due. Can this week get any worse? The answer to that million dollar question is yes it can and it will. As the week progressed I got a call from a friend telling me that my best friend of 20 years was in a horrible car crash and she is badly injured. Not as if my day could not get any worse. I lost one hundred dollar out of my purse.  Why do this thinks happen to me? Does life have no one else to pick on. I wonder what else this week has in store for me?
