This does not mean that you were born with  this privilege or that you necessarily had this  happiness until the end of your life. You  actually witnessed the harshness of reality as  child, including the loss of your parents and  poverty.  But all this darkness disappeared the moment you  met the love of your life and a new bright light  started to shine toward your way. You ultimately  gained happiness and honor through love.  Both of you genuinely loved each other and  enjoyed a blissful life for a very long time. It  is just natural that this genuine life in your  previous existence can only be a blessing in  this  present moment.  This may be the opportunity to work for charity  by helping out other people in need and to be thankful.    \ B-type: The Charitable type You were the devoted lover in your former  existence that dedicated your whole being to the  object of affection. When you fell in love, you  forgot about everything else including your own  self.  You experienced a lot of pain because many  people  took advantage of your kindness. All your lovers were beautiful people  but they possessed narcissistic qualities, which  was the result of your breakups. Their  selfishness never allowed them to return the  love  that you continuously provided for them. But you  never despised them for the wounds they left on  you.  What you should do in this life-time is to  become  more sensible, rational, and calculative, so  that  you will not have to endure so much pain as you  did in the past. Don't just settle for anyone  who  crosses your path but wait patiently for someone  who will provide you with a reciprocal love.    \ C-type: The Lascivious type You were a very fickle person in your previous  life, who could not stay with one partner for a long time. Love was something  you had to experience through as many people as  possible and only then were you happy as a  person. You met many, diverse people whom you  shared an intimate relationship with.  Although you were an amorous lover, you  possessed  a cold and rational mind. It gave you this power of never being hurt by  someone. It will be difficult to settle down  completely for you unless you meet a very  charismatic person that will capture your entire  heart. And a journey for you would not  completely  end with marriage either.    \ D-type: The Reckless type You were the center of a love triangle or an  immoral love that was destined to end  tragically.  Your rash and independent spirit set the stage  for a love story like this. You were an  egocentric character who broke many people's  hearts. In this way, you were much like the C- type that was previously mentioned. You moved on  from one person to another as soon as that spark  or passion for you faded.  A person who existed as this type in the past is  bound to be affected by these remnant qualities  today. This is why it is vital to appreciate the  other person in your relationship now and to  become more mature. Getting rid of your selfish  desires may be the key to a happy relationship  for you.    \ E-type: The Romeo and Juliet type You are one of the few people who experienced  the  most passionate love affair in your former life.  It was love at first sight and both of you could not think of anything else during the day than  to  dream about each other.  It was a Romeo and Juliet love affair, which may  not have ended in disaster just like in the  story. Your families may even have been very  accepting about your relationship. But the  likelihood of a passionate love increases the  more obstacles are between the two lovers. But  the affection tends to fade when there is no  conflicting element involved.  Therefore, it is important for you to be more  patient in your present relationship. The  challenge is to keep that passion going by  constantly introducing new and interesting ideas.    \ F-type: The Plain type You did not find love through your own actions  but with the help of other people. You were in  your own comfort zone, so that it was not  necessary for you to find someone special. This  is why you were far away from experiencing a  fervent love affair.  Everybody accepted your relationship with your  partner and stability may be have been the  pivotal characteristic of your love. Many people  would not even consider this peaceful and simple  relationship to be love but it may just be the  true essence.  You may feel perfectly comfortable with an  arranged marriage.    \ G-type: The Abusive type There is no human being who perfect and  therefore  a certain contradiction exists within us. Thus,  an internal conflict between cruelty and  kindness  is apparent in us.  You were familiar with this conflict in your  previous life, where mistreatment was used on  people. There was a lot of anger in you and this  may be a reason why you were open to challenges  without a blink of an eye.  You often found this sardonic pleasure when you  made a person feel sad or perplexed. Monotony  did  not exist in your vocabulary and so you looked  for excitement. A little child exists in you  that  is waiting for stability and you have shot at  finding love when you find the person who is  able  to provide this comfort for you.    \ H-type: The Glass Marble type You were a purely naive person who was scared to  be hurt. This led you to love a person from afar  but the chance that you came together was very  slim.  You were a sociable person but oddly enough, you  became the shy and quiet person in front of the person you liked. The  painful event occurred when the day your object  of affection became another person's mate and  moved to another faraway place. You have to  accept the fact that you will not see a  relationship in the future if you don't start  gaining some courage to make that crucial  advance. You can start with taking subtle steps  toward that person
