I mean, yes, of course I have been feeling lazy and not accomplishing much, but I've been like that since spring. -_-;; Sad, I know, but what can I do besides try to be better?  Anyway, my point is that I had so much fun today!  In the morning, I drove my parents on route 22 , which everyone says is the worst place to drive, though I've never really minded it.  I was dropped off at Borders where I read manga.  >.  horrible   at making decisions, I didn't buy any.  *sniffles*  I'll need someone to tell me which series to collect!  Then, in the afternoon, I went to the Livingston mall and shopped like the mall rat I am!  Sales are soooo awesome!  ^__^  While I was at Borders, I spent an hour and a half reading the first and most of the second Kare Kano manga because Mercs had told me about the series before she moved.  I liked it, thought I will have to admit that it's very different from the type of manga I normally read, mostly because it seems quite a bit more lighthearted- the issues involved, at least.  I did discover that I have this weird tendency to like characters that have a history.  (hehe, Arima is a potential candidate for my anime harem...)  Another reason why I enjoyed Kare Kano is because the main character, Yukino, is so much like me that it's scary.  It's almost as if there were a series printed about me!  *gasps*  Well, I know we aren't exactly alike, but the few similarities we share certainly are unnerving.  For one thing, I am a comletely different person at home than I appear at school.  I live like a slob!  For another, I  am  a perfectionist and I am competitive when it comes to academics.  I also do enjoy praise and though I'm not sure as to whether or not everything I do is   for   praise like Yukino, it could be.  I do become jealous easily and I'm not sure if I am a fraud, but I very well may be one if I seemingly lead double lives.  I know, not a very flattering picture of myself, but who knows?  It could be more accurate.
