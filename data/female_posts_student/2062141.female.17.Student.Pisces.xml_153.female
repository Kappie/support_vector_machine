This whole week we get to come in at 9:45, except tomorrow because of Link Crew, but on Friday we get to sleep in when everybody else has to go see a seminar on HIV/AIDS. They're like, Link Crew don't get AIDS. You'll be fine. Show the freshmen where LA 101 is, Wear a condom. That's our motto. So anyways. I got the new Prince CD, which also is making me happy. And I affirmed that we have a half-day next week, which always promises fun and happiness. And Charlotte's staying at my house all week cause her mommy's in Vegas, and we're having fun chillin', and pining after this gorgeous dress I picked out for her to go to Prom in. It's so pretty (well i picked it out) but I won't describe it in the unlikely case that Nick should look at this. So yeah. I'm feeling better and I have the best boyfriend ever. Cause I am the Proudest Monkey
