Right now I'm reading, The Healing Time of Hickeys.. Haha Yeah it's not REALLY good but it's okay so I just keep reading it.      I haven't read any books in a really long time so I am kinda proud of myself for actually doing it now.My step-dad Jerry just told me he needs to use this computer in a couple minutes. Haha, more on him later.All I'm gonna say right now is that he is an ANNOYING Shit.   I think a little later I might kinda explain my family situation and everything.   I don't know why I feel like I'm writing this to someone, because no one ever really reads my posts as far as I can tell. If you read my posts will you please Leave a note because I'd like to see what's goin on.      Yeah, thanks.
