I was not feeling good so the whole time I was all out of it because I wasn't feeling good. Then my mom and I went to Seaworld to go meet Naomi! We got there at like 3. It was HOT! But yah-we went to go see some shows or whatever. I really liked the Fireworks...they were pretty! People were shoving a lot and I wasn't feeling good, so I was REALLY annoyed. I felt like the 3rd wheel with my mom and Naomi. They weren't even talking to me, so basically I was there all alone! I wish I would have had someone there with me. I hated it so much! I wasn't feeling good and I was being ignored! Then, I decide I wanna go to Lytle cause I don't wanna be HERE...and like there were some difficulties! There is this guy that is married to Lucas' cousin. He is 20 and like supposedly he was looking at me a couple of times or whatever. I wasn't encouraging the situation, in fact-I was clueless until Mesha told James and he talked to me. From then on, I became uncomfortable. Well, long story short, he called me and James found out. He had just called to see how I was and it was wrong cause he is married but my brother doesn't like him and he got MAD. Now, when I get home from having a bad day, my brother calls to say to me that he thinks it is best that I just don't show my face in Lytle for awhile until they figure out what to do with him...and they expect me to be ok with it! YAH RIGHT!!! I am so emotional right now and I just started to cry :o( I was so sad! I feel like I have no where. I don't wanna be here and I can't be there. But I don't know what to do...it is gonna be so uncomfortable when I see him now. They said they were gonna talk to him and then that will put me on the spot. I just wish this wasn't happeneing! UGH-I hate it! So now here I am...sad! I am so tired but I don't feel good and when I don't feel good, I don't sleep! SUCKS!! Anyways-hope whoever is reading this had a great 4th! But yah-sorry this entry is so extremely boring. I had to say what was on my mind. And I think I may be in Lytle for a couple days...so if you don't hear from me, that's where I am! Well, I guess I am gonna go for right now! Bye guys and I love you! MUAH xoxo...
