We went over to Las Palmas (Abby, you KNOW it's your favorite restaurant!) with the Harmons, and Holly had her boyfriend, Matt with her, so Rob came (I ate in front of him!!  We're really getting somehwere.)  Then we (minus Matt) went to the Harmons to watch the game which we lost.  Oh well.  We had fun anyway.  Rob really blends well with the family and god-family.  He was really sweet tonight even though everyone was acting like their normal, embarrassing selves.  I don't know, I guess I didn't expect it to go so well or something.  This might actually turn out to be something.  We might be like a "Josh and Abby, Jr."  That would be so cute.  He actually mentioned that the other day on the way to the pep rally, which was kinda weird, but I can see where he's coming from.  I think we've gotten through the major "hurdles" now, thank God.  This might work.  Wow.  Who would've ever thought.    Wow, you have now just read my innermost thoughts.  Congratulations.  That's what happens when I'm this tired.  I actually fell asleep on his shoulder during the last four minutes of the game.  When I woke up, he was like "Are you INSANE???  That was the entire game right there."  Yeah, like I cared.  I'd just spent like 30 minutes asleep on his shoulder.  OK, I'm going to bed now before I give you intimate details about the rest of my life.  Oh, and Keilei came home last Monday.  I think I forgot to mention that on here.  Maybe I didn't, but it's almost midnight.  And Abby (nobody else bother reading this; it won't make sense):  No rule of three.  Sorry.
