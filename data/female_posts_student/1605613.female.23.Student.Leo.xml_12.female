In three games versus the Indians Glaus went 9 for 11, had 3 walks, hit 7 homeruns, scored 11 times and drove in 16. Numbers that would make anyone drool. He didn't stop there though. In the Angels next game gainst the Blue Jays Glaus again went 3 for 3 hit 2 more homers and scored 3 times as he was selected as player of the game for the 4th straight game. Maybe more impressive is that during those 4 games Glaus only struck out twice.  His three homeruns off of Scott Erickson on 4/29/2004 was the first 3 HR game in TBPB history. Two days later Glaus was selected as player of the month for April.   Glaus wasn't the only player on the Angels beating up on the Indians and Blue Jays though. Frank Tanana won the AL pitcher of the month award with a 2.72 ERA and a 5-0 record to boot. Robb Quinlan hit 3 homeruns himself, 2 against the Blue Jays. Jeff Cirillo is hitting .429 over his last give games and Ruyss Branyan has hit 3 homerins and is hitting .278 over his last five as well. Frank Tanana continued his great starting pitching going 7.1 innings allowing only a single run to the Indians. Joe Kennedy also threw a complete game allowing one run to the Tribe. In one game agains the Tribe the Angels scored 16 runs on only 15 hits and Brian Roberts stole 5 bases.  With the domination of the Indians the Angels moved into first in the AL West for the first time all season. Bud Black who missed his last start will miss his next start as well, as he was placed on the DL. Casey Fossum will take his turn again. In his last start Fossum went 7.1 innigns of shutout ball in a win against the Tigers.
