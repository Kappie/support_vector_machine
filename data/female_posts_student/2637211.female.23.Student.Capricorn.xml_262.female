Also, I really love the  urlLink bridemaids' dresses , or at least the color and cut of the skirt. I think my girls will all need different tops, but hopefully I can ask for knee-length A-line skirts like this. I really like  urlLink these bouquets . More brainstorming to come.  edit: it looks like the bouquet site won't let me post specific pictures, but if you click through, the wedding cake is lovely too.
