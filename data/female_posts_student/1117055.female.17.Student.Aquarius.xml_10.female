Also notice the wonderful wheat adorning our table.  Mmmmm....... Anyway, this is at the Hotel Belvidere, where we, err, slept and ate I guess. It was quite a beautiful hotel, If I do say so myself. Which I just did.  Anyway, yeah. Fanta rocks.    urlLink    This is the rest of our group eating.  Notice the weird man to the right of Ms. Hefty? That would be Ciro the Awesome, our bus driver.  Even Coke, as you can see, comes in huge glass bottles like that, (like the fanta did) in Europe, which was quite weird.  Also all the water was bottled and if you didnt ask for it "senza gas" it came all bubbly.  Which was quite weird, but I somehow came to enjoy it.  I don't know how.    urlLink    And then, like the smooth kid I am, dropped the Camera.  Note the um, tablecloth, I guess, and I don't quite know why I put this picture in, but now that it's there, oh well.  I wonder what that is on the right.  A shoe? We may never know.  So that was interesting...... moving along........     urlLink    Alice and I at that same hotel with a view of the water and beautiful balconies.  This picture was taken by Francesco, a friend we all made at that town who was pretty cool and enjoyed Oasis.  So we all sang "Wonderwall" and had an Almost-Famous caliber bus sing-along.  It was wonderful.    urlLink    The view from this place was AMAZING, this picture really doesnt capture it, but man,  it was so breathtaking to look down upon the town and just to be able to see for miles (or I guess kilometers....... ew makes me think of Physics) out onto the ocean.  I loved this place.  Gaah, Italy is so gorgeous, I miss it now.    urlLink    This is the family that owned this Hotel Belvidere.  The man in the middle beside Ms. Hefty is Salvatore, who is the father, and his family was so nice and thoughtful and very excited to have Americans staying with them.  He brought out the USA flag and had a welcoming party for us, and explained to us how he made olive oil, and we got some of his olive oil, and, these people were just great.    urlLink    This is the lady that made me special wheat free food and talked to me about it for a while, and she was really nice to me.  She was like my little Italian friend and she gave me a hug when I left and everything.  I loved her.  Here's also a good view of..... well the view.  I forgot her name, but she was very cool.    urlLink    Me at the Beach in Sapri.  Sapri was the first big town we visited, which was nice.  Note the beach is not really sand, but more like little stones, which makes for interesting lounging.  Not quite as bad as the beach near the Hotel Belvidere, where the rocks were really big and really uncomfortable.
