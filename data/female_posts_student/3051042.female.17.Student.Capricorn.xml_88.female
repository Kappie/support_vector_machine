Emphasis on was... but now I'm just confused, and half of that is my fault. I knew I should have never said anything, and the truth doesn't hurt, but realizing what I felt was not the truth, that hurt. And now I sit here... at 4 in the morning. When just about 7 hours ago I was scared I didn't feel the same way... I didn't know what to feel. I was hoping that much of my first idea was not true, but everyone knows how I am with hopes.   Last night I got drunk as shit at William's. Ned and I dropped Michelle off a little late, and headed back to William's to talk. The talk was complicated and involved too much thinking. But the thinking I did last night was not a result of a sober girl... which scares me because I remember some important points I made, and the responses given... but I don't really remember the full picture. Maybe I'll find out some day. Maybe not. I don't know... yeah I do.   I'm going to sleep. More later... if time allows.
