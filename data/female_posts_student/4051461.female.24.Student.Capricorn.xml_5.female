And all I find are souvenirs from better times,  before the gleam of your tail lights fading east...to find...yourself a better life.   there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all and here i rest where disappointment and regret collide...lying awake at night   -Deathcab for Cutie
