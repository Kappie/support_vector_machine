And nothing  can  bring me down. This summer will be one to remember...I  know  it. I'm just so ready to let go of everything. I wish summer could last forever. And ever and ever and ever. Because then I'd be happy forever. I mean, every day like today, every gray, cold, depressing day lasts forever. I am sitting here wondering how to make it through today, let alone the rest of winter. It just seems like it never ends...and summer is all too short. I live in the summer, and in the winter I just die so slowly.  I just got the inspiration to take my life and turn it around. How odd is that. It just sparked out of nowhere. This life I'm living...I don't need it anymore. I'm sick of hiding behind everything! I can't just sit here anymore...just sit here and waste everything away. Everything I used to be. I want to be everything I used to be, but I want to be more. I've grown dependent on everything that is ruining me, and it's time for me to let go. I've basked in misery for far too long.  I'm going to be happy. I'm going to live and I'm going to love it.  Well, enough rambling! Adios crazies!
