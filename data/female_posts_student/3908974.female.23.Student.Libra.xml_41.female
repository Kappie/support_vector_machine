I'm so goddamn tired, having stayed up until deep dawn to hear the birds sing, only to climb out of bed at noon to go running in the hot sun.  I love the running, and god knows I need to keep it up, but I am still at the stage where my physique isn't exactly bending to my will.  I can make myself go for two miles, but it still hurts like hell and I keep hearing this old blues tune riffing in my head while I shuffle my poor little legs down the trail:  My body's built for comfort, not for speed...My body's built for comfort, not for speed...My body's built...  But at least I am doing it, and it feels good in some ways.  Like yesterday, when it rained and my man and I decided to go outside anyway.  We ran soaking wet through the park and watched the swollen runoff ditches swirling with brown water and threw mock punches at each other.  That was a good thing.  Went to the bookstore yesterday eve, which is financial suicide.  More old British literature for me to while away the hours with.  Also bought A Confederacy of Dunces, Pulitzer Prize winner and cult classic.  I got my credit card renewed, so I've been spending freely.  But I know this is bad news for me, as much as I dig my new cd's and used books.  I have a wee problem with putting immediate gratification to the side.  I want to spend my twenties fancy fee and living it up.  I won't be this free ever again, and I always justify my bar hopping and pleasure tripping and book buying with the thought that I won't want to look back at this time in my life and see  a string of dull nights.  (A fallacy I know.)  What else... Oh , how can I forget.  My roommate and the boys went to KC yesterday night, just to get out of town.  Our excuse was the city wide smoking ban on all public places, but really I think we were all just eager for a change of scenery.  We ended up at the kind of bar where Poison and Motely Crue play loudly all night and the patrons (predominantly white middle thirties males) all headbang and do air guitar when they believe nobody is watching.  It was a good place, don't get me wrong.  But I have had my year's quota of shitty hair rock after last night.  I watched my friends play pool and tried to prevent myself from being left alone with my roommate's boyfriend, who is so whiny and immature and dull that I can't think of one thing to say to him after knowing him for nearly a year and a half.  Today my man and I are supposed to go on an adventure.  No idea where we're going, but I'm betting we won't get too far.  Probably won't make it out of Kansas, but that's fine with me.  While I was trying to take a nap this afternoon, I found the end of my story.  It came to me while I tossed and turned in the heat of my apartment.  It always happens that way, ideas rushing in from the periphery when I least expect.  My roommate and I discussed our pending road trip today.  Our fab four has been long planning an excursion around her move to Yale.  She wants to close the book on her man, but he's the one providing transport to Connecticut.  Now she's saying we should rent a U Haul and ditch the guys, which is okay with me.  But god this is getting complicated.    Well, adventure awaits.
