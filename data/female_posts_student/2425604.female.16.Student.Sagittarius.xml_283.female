My friend,  You're always the last one to leave those dimly lit rooms Making sure the last glass makes it's way to the table empty  And every bottle in the place has been upside down At least a few times What a waste Is this what's left of you these days?  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  I swear,  If I could take your pain and frame it and hang it on my wall Maybe you wouldnever have to hurt at all I'm painting pictures in red and blue A portrait bruised just like you And now you're walking away  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  When is enough finally enough? All the hang-ups and heartbreaks get you past all failures and bad breaks Just accept yourself Find something that brings you closer to complete  Painting pictures in red and blue A portrait bruised just like you And now you're walking away  You're not 18 anymore 5 years should have been enough time For you to grow up and get over this It's not too cool  To be throwing up all morning  Sick from what you might have done or done it with  When is enough finally enough? When is enough finally enough?
