Today I went out with Scott and Andy and our original plan was to go  to the Thrift Store in Freeland and then whatever afterwards. We ended up going  to Cassidy's and Charlie's afterwards and watching a few videos and such and  then we left there and went to the firehouse on Saratoga to wash Scott's car and  from there drove to Scott's house where we raided the kitchen and played in his  room with his various toys. For those of you with dirty minds, I'm speaking of  Slinkys, harmonicas and dancing rodents. Then from there we decided to go to the  store for icecream, pizza, pop and candy and then watch a movie at the Freeland  Firestation. It was a wonderful day. I ended it with an Elton John record, a  milk glass vase, and a full stomach. Anywho-- I'm talking to Andy so I will  write more later. I WILL. :D
