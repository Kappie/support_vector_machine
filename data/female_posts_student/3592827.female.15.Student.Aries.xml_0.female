Later, I talked to him and had a one-sided conversation. You know, the ones that go like this: Me: I picked up your violin. What would you do without me? Khaki: Thanks. Me: Have fun "certain-college"ing. Khaki: Yup. I won't be leaving for a couple of weeks, though. xx/xx is moving day. Me: Oh, is it just you or is your whole family going? Khaki: Just me. Me: Alright, well, enjoy summer! Khaki: Sure, you, too. I can almost feel the fires of Mordor nipping at me. The flames mock me and my Khaki-less-ness! "Khaki is leaving on xx/xx!!! And he's never coming back! Muah-hahhahaha!"... crappy cheap cinematic flames... I'll get you   :P . By the way, I probably just gave away Khaki's identity.. However, he is leaving so what the hey. I've got Matchbox 20 to take care of me. *sniff sniff*  I got a disease Deep inside me Makes me feel uneasy baby I can't live without you Tell me what I am supposed to do about it Keep your distance from it Don't pay no attention to me I got a disease Tell me what I am supposed to do about it Keep your distance from it Don't pay no attention to me I got a disease  I think that I'm sick But leave me be while my world is coming down on me You taste like honey, honey Tell me can I be your honey Be, be strong Keep telling myself it that won't take long till I'm free of my disease Yeah well free of my disease Free of my disease...  Argh.   Can't wait for Monday's movie. Later days~
