Hey - 'saright w/me if you wanna join the  urlLink FlipBlogs webring , counting me, we're, like 85% Filipino/a, right?  Unless you count Brian, too, but he hasn't posted...  Big movie weekend for Kim  me, saw  The Tuxedo  (eh...), and  I Am Trying to Break Your Heart , a documentary about the making of Wilco's last album - I loved it (the movie), Kim was bored.  Went out and bought the new CD after, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, really liked that...  Also bought  The Exorcist  and  The Graduate , haven't watched yet.  Believe it or don't, I never saw The Exorcist, though I read the book ( before the movie came out - am I old or what? ).  They're way cheap at Sam's Club this week.  VHS, anyhow, didn't look for DVD.
