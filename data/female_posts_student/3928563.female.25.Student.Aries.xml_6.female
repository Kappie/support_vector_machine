The problem is that after sex I feel like I have little cuts just on the inside of my vagina. It makes sex pretty painful. I wonder if it's the same situation as described in "love hurts" or if it's an allergy to spermicide or latex. Any ideas? Also, on my box of Avanti (polyurethane) condoms it says "if you are not allergic to latex, you should use a latex condom." What the hell does that mean?   ----------------------------------  I think you're right: sounds like you're either irritated by the latex (rubber) your condoms are made of, or the spermicidal lubricant (containing nonoxynol-9) on the condoms.  How to find out which is the culprit? Easy. First, let your vag more or less heal from the last time you had sex. Then try having sex with a latex condom that has no spermicide on it (you can get them at your local drugstore, along with non-spermicidal lube). Feel good? Your problem is spermicide, and you are not alone: many women feel your pain. The cure is simple: stay away. Buy unlubricated condoms, provide your own, non-spermicidal lubricant (like KY), and don't use birth control methods like the diaphragm that require spermicidal foam.   If you dumped the spermicide and are still having irritation, wait a few days and try a polyurethane (non-latex) condom like the Avanti condom.  If THAT feels good, you need to start avoiding latex. Another way to test for latex sensitivity is to try wearing a rubber glove for a few hours a day. If you develop a rash on your hand, no more latex condoms for you.   Latex sensitivity is nothing to sneeze at. For starters, many fun things to put in your vagina, like  urlLink the Keeper , are made of latex. More importantly, if you're irritated by latex, you could possibly be allergic to latex gloves. You know, the kind doctors use in open-heart surgery? Although many more people are just   sensitive   to latex (think rash), rather than actually   allergic   to it (think going into anaphylactic shock), you should definitely consult a doc regarding the risks to you.  Warning : do NOT try out latex condoms if you have never used them and have reason to think you might be allergic to latex. If you are allergic, you could go into anaphylactic shock! Go to the doc instead.  If you're sensitive to latex, you still (thank God) have a few options for STI protection and birth control. I recommend you switch to polyurethane condoms. The two most popular brands are Avanti (male condom) and Reality (female condom). The downfall of polyurethane, and why there's a warning on the package, is that it's more likely to break or slip off than regular condoms. Also, it's expensive. On the plus side, it tastes better than latex and is compatible with oil-based lubes.  You could also switch to "skin" condoms. I don't know much about them, but they're non-latex, really are made out of animal skin, do provide birth control, but don't protect against STIs. I've also been told they're hideously expensive, but worth every penny, sensation-wise. Some websites recommend "doubling up" latex and skin condoms: your partner wears a latex condom next to his skin (STI protection) and then rolls a skin condom over (protects you from latex). I have my qualms about this method. First of all, that seems like an awful lot of layers for everyone's sexual pleasure. Second of all, doubling up on condoms is bad because the increased friction leads to breakage! Double up at your peril.     Your symptoms don't sound similar to those described in  love hurts . If you were having problems with too much friction during sex, the pain would be more intense and would occur primarily at the opening to your vagina. If his cock was too damn long and was bumping your cervix--another common cause of pain during sex--you'd likely feel it at the very top of your vag (now, some gals do appreciate a little cervix action, but I find it VERY uncomfortable). So if you have gotten rid of latex and spermicide as above and you're  still  having trouble with pain and irritation, go to the doctor. You probably have an infection causing your problems.
