He has amazing ninja powers of persuation and procrastination, because we've hardly gotten any of the things done that we've set out to do. My friend Holly and her friend Michelle are crashing here tonight, and we have yet to set up the loft bed in the guest bedroom. I'm supposed to be cleaning up the rest of the house, but I hate vacuuming when it's hot, which it is today. All the rest of the week it's been cool and comfortable, but now, crunch day, it's hot. Oh, crazy bay weather. Actually I can't complain, considering I'm from inland where it's probably in the high 90's while it's only 82 here today. So--I'm putting off vacuuming and am instead writing here and concurrently watching BBC News, which I find to be less creepy than American Network news, all owned by media conglomerates. Anyway, I need to vacuum then start thinking about dinner.
