I have changed a lot and I feel like a better person a way better one because of him. His name is Scott and he is old. LOL. just kidding he isn't that old he is 21. I am told by others he is a jerk, Ashley, and I could do better. But those people don't know him like I do and I don't know him like they do. I know he can be an ass but hey I will make an ass out of myself when I get hurt right? right.  Life at camp isn't reality. It's nothing like reality. I have been in two programs. Cannoeing and Arts and Crafts. I have had kids as well for 2 weeks. Swim camp and Scampers who I loved a lot!  I have been very busy I was home last weekend and I am home this weekend but for all my other weekends the first one I went to Michelle's(a girl from camps) and I got very drunk and there was a little 90210 going on but hey that got fixed. The weekend after I went to Cupar for a Cupar Gopher Drop. Lisa and I got into the drinking side even though we are under age and once again got really drunk. So I took a break and next weekend I am going to the "X" with a bunch of camp people then MAYBE Michelle's cabin for her birthday.  OH YEA!!! MARK IS 18!!!!! YAY!!!!!  I have made a lot of new friends out at camp they are amazing people I love them so much! We have had the best time and I have gotten really close with them.  But most of all I really miss all of you guys! It's super hard being out there. I don't have any of my best friends to talk about things like the age difference and how bad it is or how people out there are getting on my nerves. But I must say I and all the Lakeshore guys(who are going to Edmonton assholes!) and Jessica deserve this 3 day weekend! WE NEED IT!!!!!  Yay for counting down the hours with Tj. And going crazy with Mark. Jen and Matt never put us three together for program groups ever again. We are HORRIBLE PEOPLE!!!!! LOL.  Thanks Barb, Tj, Kate, and Mark for an awesome 3 days. Thanks Lakeshore for the great experience I never knew how freaking crazy Tj really is LOL!  Anyways I need a lot of sleep and I have a lot to do in 3 days so Later Gator!!!!
