So a pirate walks into a bar and he has a steering wheel sticking out of his fly. The bartender looks over and gestures at the wheel, saying, "'Eh there, you know you got a steering wheel sticking out of your fly?"   The pirate says, "Arr mate, I know, and it's drivin' me nuts!"  Arr! Heheheheh. I heard these on the radio this morning, in lieu of Speak Like A Pirate Day being revered by the Bob and Tom Show, and I had to share because I cried when I heard them. Plus, every five seconds or so, Bob and Tom would stop the show on account of a rousing bout of "Arr!"s. It was so [sic].   I'm eating some sort of nasty breaded plant and noodles. Oh, what is wraught in the name of sustenance.  Anyway, the weekend is almost over...this is kind of a bummer. Feel that PMS coming on already.
