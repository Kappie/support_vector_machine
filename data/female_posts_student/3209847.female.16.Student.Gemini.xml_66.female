I hope people's summers are going well.. mine has gone very well so far! I am so happy that it has gone this well. Sarah and I are doing well. Still very happy and very in love. I'm sure that's too much information but I already wrote it and I'm too lazy to erase it. I'm so ... I don't know. (Exasperating)  I miss being busy though. We leave for Canada tomorrow! WOOT! I am so very excited. We won't be incredibly busy there persay, but it will definitely be fun. 7 days with Sarah, in CANADA, is going to be phenomenal.   My dad seemed mad at me earlier tonight. I hope he's not mad at me. It just worries me sometimes. We get along pretty well. I think we butt heads sometimes because we are very much alike... yeah we really are. It was really neat to spend some time with him and Mr. Newberry and Leah today. He's definitely a guy that gets stuff done. That's for sure. I, myself, am a procrastinator. There's something we have that is different! Dad, I'm sorry if I did something tonight that made you uncomfortable. I'm sorry.   Sometimes, I feel that I am not good enough. Who all feels like that? Um, everyone, yes. We all have our insecurities. We all feel that we aren't good enough.Have you ever caught yourself in a situation that you actually FELT like a typical teenager? I do that sometimes, where I feel that I am not good enough and then think about my age. Oh yes, I'm 14 or whatever, I should be insecure about not being good enough. I didn't catch myself today, but there was an incident that something just conflicted in my mind to where I couldn't even think straight enough to push it out of my head. I couldn't get around it to think clearly. Clearly enough to get around it. A mess of words all tangled in to one big mess. Of words. I feel non-poetic and utterly sophomoric.  Oh, sorry, I just needed to get that off my chest. I am still kinda shaky from earlier. I'm probably just tired. I need to go to bed. I hope everyone has a great next 7 days while we are in Canada! We're bringing movies, swimsuits, and books! What could be better?   Bye. *Kiss* to Sarah
