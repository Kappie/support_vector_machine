I dont think I can accurately describe exactly HOW MUCH I love him.  So, why do I feel so lonely and sad all the time?   He got back Sunday and was awake for a short time before going to sleep at 9pm or so. He was tired from working all weekend.  Yesterday he got home at 3pm and went to work on my car at around 4 (so I took a nap), and was back by 6 (when he woke me up from my nap) and then was in bed again by 8.  I got to see my husband for like three hours yesterday.  When he IS awake, we barely say five words to one another, unless we're arguing. Lately, we argue a lot. Mostly, he sits in his chair with his eyes half closed and glazed over watching the Sci Fi channel until he goes to bed.  I have nobody to talk to. Nobody. And I can't find the words to tell him about this because he always interrupts with "I don't understand." What don't you understand, Brian? I'm lonely and depressed. I need to feel included in your life and right now I don't.   I hope things get better after the baby is born. Right now I sit around and watch the same shit every day on TV and poke around on the stupid message board and have no conversational ties with my own husband. How sad and pathetic is that? And I feel like crying all the time because I don't know how to tell him that I'm not happy here anymore. I love him, but I'm just not happy. Maybe it's situational.  I know he's stressed out, and I'm definitely stressed out because of the pregnancy being so taxing physically and mentally. But we were stressed out in Savannah, and he was working long hours in Savannah and things were SO DIFFERENT. We talked to each other, and cuddled, and giggled, and  had sex  and did fun things and Iwas happy. I felt paid attention to, I felt special because he devoted his life around me, and I him.  Now it's like I revolve around him and he can't be bothered.  Yes, he still kisses me and hugs me and calls me sweet pet names that I just eat right up, but then he's distant and reserved and "tired" all the time.   I don't know what to do, and I freeze up when I try to tell him all of this because I don't know how to say it without upsetting him, and it seems like he gets upset so quickly these days. But I can't just sit here and let my brain wither away and watch my sanity disappear. I'm tired of crying when we fight... hell, I'm tired of fighting with him, period.  Maybe it's all hormonal. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. I mean, he's just tired. I can totally see why he's tired cause he works like a dog. But he's leaving for school so soon and will be gone for so long I just wish he would fake it or something until he leaves, and then he can be tired all he wants in Virginia at school.   God... I'm tired myself. I woke up this morning when he went off to work and now I can't get back to sleep. Maybe I'll try again and see how it goes.  It's so hard to sleep in an empty bed when I'm so used to sleeping with him.   I hope this all gets better soon. I can't bear it any longer and fear I might just go stark raving mad and end up institutionalized with Courtney Love, or something.  -Me
