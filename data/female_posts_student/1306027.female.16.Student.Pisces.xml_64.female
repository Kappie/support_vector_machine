It's not that I don't mind being single on Valentines Day- but it's hard to be constantly reminded of what you may or may not be missing while your walking through a local Wal-Mart, seeing guys and girls rushing this way and that, diving for vday candies and vday cards and sometimes, the occastional pink monkey. I'm not pathetic.. just sad. So I sat around thinking of how I could justify my pain by blaming it on the injustice of a crappy holiday. I came up with this lovely top ten list, cleverly intitled "The Top Eight Things to Ruin Valentines Day". I know your just aching to hear it. The list is in no specific order mind you... just in the top ten.    The Top Eight Things to Ruin Valentines Day   [1].  Inflation(ism): Valentines Day is probably the most inflated (price wise) holiday of the year. I even dreamed up a mastercard commercial for it..." A dozen long stem red roses that will die within a week, 60$. A box of assorted "coronary-to-go" chocolates, 10$. A Valentines Day card that your love will most likely end up burning when you break up, 3$. Seeing the crinkled look on your loves face that says "Man, this stuff is crap!". Priceless."  [2]. The overly aggressive PDA: Not that I have a problem with couples showing that they are together... but I mean, when you get nausious at a Barnes and Nobles from watching a couple "cuddle" in a reading chair, that's just sick.   [3]. The Dentists and The Personal Trainers horror: Lets face it, chocolate may be good for your heart and soul, but it's not a great friend to your butt and thighs. Chocolates have some of the highest fat and carb rates of any candy... and whats worse.. the better they taste, the higher factor of you having to work out for a full month to drop the pounds you gained from eating that one box of chocolates. Plus- It's bad for your teeth.  [4]. "You've lost that loving feeling": Or.. the song dedications. As you sit and listen to the radio.. you might here one or two of these. People get on and spill their guts to that other person who probably isnt even listening to the radio... as you sit there wondering where the crap these people are/come from, and why you didn't meet them first!  [5]. Seeing Movies: You are bombarded with couples from anywhere and everywhere- while you sit there with your popcorn and listen to them comment to each other about the movie.. and themselves. You can't throw popcorn and tell them to shutup- because their in love! And it's Valentines Day! And- Who cares?! Plus their making out at every make-out scene in the movie.. and you just want to say "For God's Sakes- Go get a room!"   [6]. The day where the words "I love you" are most abused: I have no problem when people say I love you.. in fact I think it's kinda cute. But- when you here a person chant it like there getting ready to do the heart shaped cupcake rain dance.. than its too much.  [7]. Random telephone calls: You know Valentines Day sucks when you get a phone call from a total stranger asking for another total stanger with " I love you more than you will eva know, (insert 2nd strangers name here). And you stay silent for a moment, thinking, "I wonder what it would be like to be stranger 2."  [8]. The colors: Valentines Day has an enormous amount of pink involved..... and pink is the color of rashes.
