Right after I wrote that entry at work I was called into my dad's office. I thought I was being fired or some shit so at first I was a little nervous, but excited... lol. Turns out I'm going to be the project manager of the new Provide.Net site layout. Though, on the down side, I get to work 4 hours a day 5 days a week... plus the Jimmy Johns shifts. Just after I get a new job because they aren't giving me enough hours at Provide.Net, they give me a major project. Damn Considerate Assholes.  At any rate. Now, on to the part that will piss people off. Don't read it if you're going to get pissed off. I'm serious. It's just been pissing me off all day, so now it's my chance to spread the hate.  No, I won't say anything about this morning, don't you worry. I'm seriously pissed at you Josh. You're such a hypocrite it drives me crazy... and not in a good way. It's like this: "You make me so happy, and she pisses me off, so I'm going back to her!" Sound familiar? Oh yes. And don't get me wrong, you have said kind things about her, it's just that you mainly complain. You must have gotten me wrong. I know you're not one to chase women, so how come you chased me when I ran upstairs crying that night in the basement? And don't say it's because you cared. Don't even give me that shit, because if you cared you have chased me when I said "I'm giving you, your out." You knew that I didn't want it to be like that. You fucking knew it. Do you know how hard it was for me to say "I love you," for me to pour my heart out to people, and for you to ignore it or toss it off to the side? You should, because you were the one who listened to me when all that shit with Nick went down. All I needed was for someone to listen. I lent my ear, my shoulder, my innocents to you and my repayment is a sad ending and emotional scars. You knew you were hurting me, that's why I always talk about leaving. That's why I run. Maybe I deserve all of this, this is what I get for everything I've ever done to hurt anyone. But that still doesn't explain how you could have taken me, placed me in a bottle with all the times we spent together, and sent me out to treacherous seas with all the words that ever mattered. I'll forever be known as Henk's sister. Congratulations to me. I love you so much I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I love you. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I hate you. I love you.   Please don't tell me this is the end. I don't know if I'm going to be able to deal with this.   Finals, Two Jobs, and a Broken Heart... the Experimental Single Sonic Summer of 2004, has turned into the Trashed Stupid Single Sad Summer of 2004. I think I need a nap or something, crying about it is just wearing me out.
