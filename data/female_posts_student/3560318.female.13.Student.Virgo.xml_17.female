(no offence, the older mexican guys just scare me) anyways. i tryed to dress really modest because i knew theyres freaks out there like that. we had fun though.    tuesday i stayed in my pj's all day because i was feeling lazy and i didnt get invited to go anywhere untill sarah and kelsey walked to my house and like 2 minutes after they got there my mom got home and told me i couldnt go anywhere. they were gonna invite me to go swimming with them. that would have been great. but instaed my mom took me to georges house where i sat and watched tv all night because there was nothing else to do.   todays wednesday...yeah...i woke up at about 10:30 and i vacumed georges house. (why why why????) and now im here at my moms work...    THE PAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE TOTALLY SUCKED!!!!    please please please....i need something to do...call me if you wanna hang out...   love ya.   -Alyssa Kelsy Pinter
