But none the less   we did go with Ross's parents to  urlLink Baltimore  for the day. We walked around, had   crab cakes and went to the  urlLink Aquarium . I love the aquarium there and haven't   been for years. Ross has the pictures on his camera of all the  urlLink Sting   Rays !  I love those really really pretty animals. I want one for my own some day.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink        urlLink http://www.baltimore.org/    urlLink http://www.baltimoretourism.com/   So that was that, oh yeah and there was a rainforest part to the aquarium,   they are also updating it so who knows what other neat shit they will have.     And in between the myriad of Dr.'s appointments I helped Ross learn to ride a bike. No sir, he did not know how to ride a bike. Drive a car, skateboard, rollerblade, but apparently they walked everywhere in his town so no need to bike. Since I love to go biking he decided it was due time to learn, and well he's a natural. Just look for teh 6'6" guy on the bike.         So both Rossnami and I had interesting Dr. appointments, my ending with a NEW HORRIBLE hospital visit soon. But then I won't need all those meds. It's funny when you think that science should be able to find out why and how things come about but then the dr sits there and says "no one knows how this happens". Yay, but no biggie, it's not cancer or life threatening, or a VD, just my body going all silly. So make sure to take ur probiotics or else ur immunity goes all interesting. And Ross well his is genetic and leads to many a night of him puking. But soon we both will be better and ready for that cruise. We may even out live you.
