I actually enjoy the feeling of grease in my mouth after I eat a Chicken McNugget 2. I am uncomfortable in the company of a noisy vacuum 3. I get excited when I listen to the song TNT by AC/DC...to the point that I have to repress fist pumps 4. I used to think that I did the worlds best running man (see: 80s hip hop dance moves)...I would "running man" all over my house...still do except that larger breasts make said "running" slightly uncomfortable without proper athletic gear...however....I keep on "runnin'" 5. My first crush ever was on the host of an educational program.... "Wonder Why"'s Richard Zurawski ( urlLink http://www.rcc.ryerson.ca/ccf/networks/CTV_Television_Program_Details/Wonder_Why.html )  Perhaps my real confession is that I feel no shame...
