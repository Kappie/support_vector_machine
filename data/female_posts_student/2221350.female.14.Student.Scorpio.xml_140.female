FINALLY after a huge "family meeting" i convinced them to let me talk to mom alone, which i knew would calm her down.  so i talked to mom for about an hour, eastablished the fact that devon was just being a shit disturber and that she was not, in any way, shape, or form, miserable. well by then, everything was fine and dandy. mom was still upset, but she was going back to shreveport and was not going to get arrested or have anyone arrested.   then all-of-the-sudden, without warning, we were back where we started. aparently mom had called the house to apologize and mompat had sent her back into orbit. so in a fit, i sort of yell at mompat((respectfuly)) without actually accusing her even though i knew what had happened. so mom was still in tyler, not leaving, calling police, having a fit.   by that time, i just COULD NOT handle it anymore.   so mompat is in a terrible mood trying to get us to sympathize with her when all we wanted to do was smack her. we decided to try to let mom cool off alone this time and it worked((sort of)), so she went back to shreveport. i was simply frazzled to a fray but still being dragged around shopping for an outfit to wear to the family reunion among other things.  now that it's all said and done, only one thing is for sure: devon is the perp. devon is a little shitass brat who will say ANYTHING to get attention and coddling from mom. devon orchestrated this entire ordeal, and it blew up in her face. devon was playing both sides against the middle and i REALLY hope she's happy because it was a fucking shitfest.   ok... so chances are i played about a 5% role in this blow up. here's what happened: daddy and roseanne went out of town and were gone for like 3 days. the day before they came back, dev and i got into a little snit and i called mom and was all mad at devon. well devon called mom after that and did the pitiful misery dance and all that. so mom called dad and told him he needed to come back and fix us. well then dad called me to tell me that mom had called him and i told devon and mompat overheard. so mompat has a hissy fit at the dinner table. she calls my mom a money grubbing skank who doesn't deserve a penny of child support((you know, the child support that buys my lunch)) and who loves to stir up shit because she is a sick psycho. all this had me pretty upset, but it was the "and you two will end up EXACTLY like her if you don't get yourselves straight" that sent me over the edge. i locked myself in the bathroom for 3-4 hours, then headed straight to bed. the next day, mompat tried to bring it up but i cut her off as sharply and abruptly as i could and made up excuses((of the diorhea persuasion)) to curb her suspicions about the time in the bathroom.   oh my mother fucking gawd! what kind of grandmother is it that bashes my mother in MY presence? at the dinner table?! doesn't she realize what kind of damage that can do on a child?!? i mean, i've done enough psychology research to know what's going on, but devon has NOT. mompat puts these ideas in her head and she sucks them up like a fucking sponge! it's crazy, i tell you, completly insane.   well... once alllll this crap was over the only one who was still flipping out was mompat. so yesterday dad, roseanne, dev and i went to the zoo. i had a great time! i forgot how much fun it was to walk around and see all the animals.      Rose, Me((in my mood glasses, of course)), and Devvie  after the zoo we had lunch and i ordered mexican. we were home for a while and then we headed to a party for a friend of my dads who had just returned from iraq. we didn't stay at the party long because the lights on the entire block went out due to a power surge from the inflatable jumping castle that was set up for kids in the front yard. so we headed over to a restaurant and it was almost completely empty because it's power had also gone out. so we had more mexican food((yay!)) and then headed home to bed.   now it's already sunday. mompat is still in a bad mood... and when i say that, i mean it. in fact it is so bad that dad, dev, roseanne and i are escaping to dallas for the week, which totally thrills me. it will be from dallas to tulsa to shreveport.   just in case you're curious((because i know mammaw was)) roseanne is a doll. she's quite lovely to be around and we've been having a good time with her. devon is still weary of her because of my dad's last girlfriend, who was a real live psycho bunny-on-to-boil bitch who inflicted quite a bit of damage on poor devvie's pea brain.    next installment: the political rantings of moi
