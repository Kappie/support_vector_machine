Got bored because it was so dull and dreary. Gave up. Had a piece of toast for lunhc at 11am. Played midtown madness for 45 minutes. Walked to the village to go to work. Worked in shop for 4 and a half hours. Encountered some veyr strange people. Packed up. walked home. Played midtown madness until dinner. Tried to make CD work- it won't. Currently sitting here. Wondering what to do. It's rainging. Yuck. Might come back later. Might not.
