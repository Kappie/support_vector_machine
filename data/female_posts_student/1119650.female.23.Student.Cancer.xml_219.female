If something weren't about to surface then why would  urlLink Ari Fleischer ,  urlLink Christine Whitman  and  urlLink Tommy Franks  all retire, resign, stepdown within a week of each other.  We have the Presiden'ts spokesman, EPA cheif, and head tactical general all retiring in one fricking week?  The poop is about to hit the fan kids, hold on to your asses.    And in other news, Stone Temple Pilots front man,  urlLink Scott Weiland  was arrested for drug possesion again on Monday.  Way to be scott, way to be.
