Apparently I am already a workaholic in training. My day is insane. From work to art history to work to home and teaching myself ecology while learning what I need to know for art history. Gah, it's like school almost.  And my computer is giving me problem... I had a lovely entry typed up yestreday. Just as I was completing my last word, Internet Explorer crashed. Bye bye babble and hellooo blank screen. Grrr.
