Amigos, amigas, that was not a brag, nor was it pride, it was simply-taking the next step. Of course, most of my pals wouldn't see me doing that-hehe ;P.  But Faith guys may push me away, and go, what the "he** are you thinking!" No-just kidding. Prolly half of the guys in the school really dislike me anywayz-who knows? But as Van would probably tell me, who cares? LOL I want to write a book one day on the significant differences between girls and guys. Besides differences in about EVERYTHING or most things, what else? '"Sometimes I wish I were a leaf flying away, falling asleep". I guess on the emotional side, girlss will feel that. For guys? To takcle the male mind is like going inside a dark room where you're trying to find the switch. When you do find it-you can either like it, find it interesting, or find it empty or boring and leave. Kung puede ko lang isipin yung iniisip nila, well, I guess it'd be easier. Well enough of my guy theories now, I'll prolly end up single and living it up in New York, in a loft with 2 gay guys as my roommates-them teaching me about the world of the gay, and me teaching them the world of the straight! Hehe-lol that would be funny. It's like mixing ice cream and sausages ending up with funny epxressions on your face. But I like to enter the non-conformist, idealistic world. I think my mom would kill me to do so, but I have to find my niche one way or the other in this world.
