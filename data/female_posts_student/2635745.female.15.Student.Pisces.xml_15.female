And also he who shall remain unamed stop me today to tell me somthing that happened to him.  It was really funny.  This has been a great week.  I got back from babysitting tonight.  It was my first time with these kids.  They were probably my best so far.  Extremely obedient.  Never had to ask them twice.  And I got forty dollars.  This week should be called SPECIAL CAITLIN WEEK.  WEE
