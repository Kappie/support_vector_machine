I also just got in from nashville and lebanon. I went to church with dad as always and we had communion. Wow..ive never taken communion from a church like that, but u know communion is communion and as long as it symbolizes the same thing it doesnt matter where i take it. It was different. The scripture they use in that church..i dont like it. Something was said today in the communion readings about how jesus died and then was "banished to hell and on the 3rd day he rose to heaven" WELL...ive never heard about jesus going to hell...lol i thought he was perfect and duh..hes gods soon! and if hell is supposed to be feared, why would god send his son? jesus christ, where did people get that idea that he went to hell?! If jesus went to hell, then i guess EVERYONE in the world is going to hell. So, i asked my dad in the car why they said jesus went to hell when i believe he didnt and ive never heard that part of the story. he was like..oh i didnt even notice..umm duh, its YOUR church, YOU should KNOW what they believe. dammit. i didnt like it. lol oh and another thing...i have found a new oxymoron "penicostal hymn". hymns are works or art, beautiful songs, meant to be played by an organ. penicostal hyms are loud and weird and with drums. oxymoron. now, i will admitt, im being a lil closedminded..yes i realize that. but im hardly never like this about something...but as long as people go to church right? its their right and freedom. but..i still dont like. lol i'll be glad to be back at my church.   Dad and i went to Cracker Barrel for lunch after church and i was walkin around the little store and omg..i saw something sooo cute so i went over to look at it. It was a toddlers toy,you know those "no hard plastic" toys that are u know..plush. lol  but it was a jeep wrangler and it had 2 little dolls, a boy and a girl and a dog. The boy was wearing jeans and a yellow shirt and a hat to the side, the girl had blonde hair and was dressed in all pink. They ride around with the dog in the back seat and them in the front. I picked it up to look closer at it and i was lookin at the lil boy and i noticed on his yellow shirt was written DANNY. just like that. wow..freaked the hell outta me. a toy jeep wrangler with a dude named danny in it and a blonde chick dressed in all pink...lol. i was gonna buy it but it was $15..and decided to buy a shirt at american eagle instead. lol well...it was totally freaky.   btw, i just looked over at the fish and theres one up to the glass lookina t me and hes got his HUGE ass string of shit hangin outta his fishie butt. ew...gross. lol hahaha i just put my hand up to him and he swam away, but only some of it broke off...ewww gross. a constipated fish. EWWW and omg..theres another one!! its just hanging outta it! WHATS WRONG WITH THESE FISH?! omg..2 constipated fish in the same tank..wow..maybe i should stop feeding them every morning. haha   I bought 2 pairs of sunglasses today. a pink pair and a clear pair. they're really cute in my hair..i might as well wear em like that.  Mom is on her way to hondorus..hip hip hooray. hope her and her bf are enjoying my fuckin trip. at least she'll bring be back a new purse or something LV cuz she prob feels bad about me being away in tenn and not being able to go on the trip..oh and guess what? john, roberta, and zack and me and my bros and mom are all taking a trip next summer..john wants to go on a disney cruise. hey, thats fine with me. but mom would like for us ALL to go to hondorus..excuse me, but im not going to hondorus with a 4yr old and roberta. she cant stay sober in her own home with her child, so i dont even wanna see her in a town where she can be thrown in jail for no reason. no..noooo. not me. i'll go with MY family as in my bros and mom. a disney cruise would be cool though. we can all be entertained on that one. oh and did i mention mom and john wanna take small trips to like purto rico and shit. umm..that pisses me off, why? CUZ WE NEVER GO ON FAMILY VACATIONS EXECPT TO THE DAMN BEACH AND WE DONT EVEN DO THAT EVERY YEAR and now shes gonna jump a plane and leave everyone here?! HELL NO. ugh..lol thats not fair. she hardly even eats dinner at her own home with her own damn family, shes certainly not leaving us alone for a week so she can have a vacation. and anyways, johns into "family" stuff, where the whole family can enjoy something. muhahah my mommie got stuck with someone who LIKES to be with her kids. too damn bad. lol   im gonna go play some guitar, im finally gettin the chords down and changing between all of them smoothly.   *much love and phish food*
