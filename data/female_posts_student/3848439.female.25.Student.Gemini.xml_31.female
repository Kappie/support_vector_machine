Anyway, the local political pundit was saying that the name of Alan Keyes was being bandied around to run for IL Republican National Senate.  Alan Keyes?  That man's nearly had his National Negro Card nullified due to dumb behavior in public.  And no, not just because he's a Republican - Armstrong Williams and J.C. Watts are still on good terms with the voting committee at the National Negro Annual Meetings.  But most modern gansta rappers and execs at BET are in danger of losing theirs.  Alan Keyes?  And Jim Oberweis (he of the big ol' dairy) is still screaming, "Hey, I came in second in the primaries!  Where's the love?"
