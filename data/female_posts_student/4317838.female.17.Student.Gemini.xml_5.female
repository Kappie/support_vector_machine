Well I'm currently listening to  urlLink Muse  : Time is running out. A pretty good song 'cos its fairly original in terms of todays music. I've not really done much today... Got up to talk to Gordy, slept some more then got up to make myself a lovely lunch of burger and noodles. mmmmm. Then i decided it was time to face the naked zombies on  urlLink RE0  and managed to pwn them good! Oooo and I did myself a french manicure which I'm quite proud of. Even if I do say so myself.  Anyway, on this fine day I have a topic I wish to talk about. Romance. Good news guys, it really isn't dead. 2 members of the male population have restored my faith (not to mention Gordy but that goes without saying) But one picked a lovely piece of jewellery for his girl *jealous* and the other organised a surprise for his girlfriend consisting of roses and candles. awwwwww.  Well that's me done for today. I'm sure I'll write again soon though. This really is a good idea...
