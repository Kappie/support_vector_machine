Anyway, we will see.  The reults should be there though.  I am optimisitic that all this will be resolved and everything will be okay.  I got an A on my first paper.  He only handed out 4 A's and I had one of them.  WOOHOO.    Anyway, that was more an ego thing.  i do want to one day pursue writing...but when I will be able to will be a whole other story.  One day, right?  Well I hope you are all doing well adn that life is treating you kindly.  I want to go o ut with Ed and see a movie...too bad we don't have any money for that.  Oh well..
