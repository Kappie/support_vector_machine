Dec. 27 was our legal shopping day (unless it was a Sunday, going back even further....)  This year, almost every store is open offering huge savings on particular items.  I don't know whether to lament the fact we're becoming more Americanized by ignoring the Boxing Day statutory holiday or to celebrate our Americanization with all the shopping perks that entails.  I'll have to get back to you on that.  More to come...
