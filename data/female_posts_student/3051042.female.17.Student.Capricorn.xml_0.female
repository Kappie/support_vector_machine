We headed to Old Navy, and discovered that I'm now a size 6 not a 12. I told Max (ah... Max) that now that I've stopped eating I should stop sleeping. Not too worried about all this becoming a habit. It grows old, I get stoned, then end up eating everything in sight. I went to work, and work was work. Doing the look up on all these hosting sites is making me eager to learn code again. But I don't think I have enough patience to do it on my own ;-) One of Nick's hottttt friends stopped by. I thought they'd already left for Kettering today, oh well. This kid is a substitute teacher... hilarious.   And lyrics to end the night with a *sigh* I hear relief but I don't feel it.  ----Edited----  *deletes lyrics*  That would have been taken the wrong way....
