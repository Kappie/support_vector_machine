(wow, i'm really running out of ideas for greetings.)  today was sweet...got up at 9:30 (not so sweet), went on msn, had a shower, packed my bag, and took the bus to emily's house! then we walked to erin's house, vanessa came over, and then we all went svimming in erin's awesome pool.  then we all dried off, i took some pictures with my camera, and then we did hair/make-up. then vanessa went home, and me, erin and em walked to the school, em went to track, and me and erin picked up her little sister from camp. then we went back to her house, and my dad picked me up.  *as emily was doing my make-up* "you look like your brother."-emily. "...thanks."-me  "i'm drowning!"-vanessa "then stand up!"-me  "i was sitting in the hospital, and all the nurses were talking. and i was listening, and they said 'havent u seen those? they're huge! they're like long and big, and black, and 1 inch in diameter'...and i waslike thinking to myself 'hmm...lemme guess..a penis?'...and the other nurse said "oh yeah, ive seen those slugs!"...haha, perverted nurses."-vanessa   Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:  apparently your supposed to put toothpaste on misquitoe bites.  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   my gramma told me. because ihave 36 of them   Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   fuck, my legs look so yukki  a bitter ending to a slow decay- so take your tears and go away, and i'll sit here with a smile and a match.[13 days. woor.] says:  eww 36?  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   yes  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   and the wierd thing is, i was wearing pants.  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   FUCKING PERVERTED MISQUITOES WENT DOWN MY PANTS! god!  ...i can't remember anything else. fruk.  so no plans for this week...well, i have my mum's friends' visit to look forward to (not). it's not my mum's friend that's the problem...it's her son. he's my brother's age, and my brother's going to be away at summer school. so that means i might have to entertain the guy for the day...won't that be fun/awkward.  i got a major burn on my shoulders/back today. it was sweet...kindof. it hurts right now...and i don't know how i'll be able to sleep. woor.  13 days till england. 6 days till i get my braces off. so much to look forward to.  well, i'm out. paice. (running out of goodbye things as well.)  butterflies and zebras, and moonbeams and fairy tales- that's all she ever thinks about.  kayte.  p.s. jimi hendrix is sweet.
