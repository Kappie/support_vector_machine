She hates it when I curse, or when I smoke or when I represent anything but myself... which I don't blame her for - she wants me as I was in November.  God, I am that girl - just a little more confused because I want to be her WOMAN in an adult life. I am a TALENTED, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN lost without her.  None of that matters. I can't wait to sleep next to her.  Feel her breath on my shoulder without her knowledge.  God she's beautiful - just gorgeous.   I love my Jen.
