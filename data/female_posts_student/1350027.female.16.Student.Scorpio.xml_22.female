I was enthralled and completely psyched about it.  I should have remembered Fred telling me about this chinese band which plays really good music - but as usual, I let it slip and completely forgot about it. He told me to go to their site and check out their demo songs. The site somehow didn't seem to play music and I just ignored their existence and carried on with my naive music mp3 files and just applied to being contented.  He passes me a song when I was up to my head going insane. It was the time where the 3 computers decided to die on me and I was so close to dying along with them. The same day, Spanky my laptop, decided to work again after Dr. Paul took a look and reformatted it. I came online and Fred, being my FaZAa as I call him, passed me this brilliant untitled song.   I listened to the whole 3 minutes of it, repeatedly. I was so amazed by the sounds and the vocals. The beautifully captivated melody. Like a cross between something Mogwai would play and a indie slow rock lament. It was such a beautiful song.  "Finer Lights and Fairytales." The title of the song says it all.  I asked him about the band and where did they hail from and all that other 411 you'd usually ask about a band. He replied hastily saying "I told you it was the Hong Kong band. Didn't you check out the website?!" I sat down with my mouth open. "OMG CHINESE BOYS CAN SING" was all I could reply. For the next 5 minutes, I kept on asking him were they really from Hong Kong. The poor German guy had to keep reassuring me they were and why was I so shocked about it. I passed it to Michelle, and told her they were 4 hongkies. She was pretty much impressed as hell and Michelle is such a non-rocker loud chick - being as beautiful as she is, she listens to beautiful jazz and slow songs which is the perfect music epitome for her dainty nature. But the point was, SHE was as impressed as I was.  I found some good Japanese bands. Well, rather - Fred sent me some really good Japanese bands as well. It's amazing you can't tell the next asian boy to a white boy. Kudos boys of Asia. I know I'm leaning against the RACIST side by saying "OMG - ASIAN BOYS CAN SING MINUS THE CINAPEK ACCENT" and all that and perhaps I've just always held on to the perception that "You'd know they're asian when you hear them by their pronunciation and the way they work their music and sing". I've never been so wrong.    OKAY. My point has been all jumbled up; Let me try to rephrase myself.   Whence He Came  is playing on the 24th in Jalan Ampang along some other really good bands. I've never been so excited in my life. Paul's a sweetheart because it IS his birthday and I should spend the day with him but I've been pestering about the fact the band was suppose to do a show here and in Singapore for so long (even telling him if they perform only in Singapore - we'll DRIVE down and DRIVE back up before my CURFEW chimes) that he's pretty much passive about my enthusiasm and gave me a green light to go "enjoy myself."  *Dances* I'll smell like an ashtray at the end of the day. But OMG! WHC IS HERE AND IM GOING IM GOING IM GOING IM GOING!  PS: You people have no idea what the fuck I'm rambling about, isn't it? I didn't think so either. Just ignore this post. I had to just gloat about it for if I didn't, I was worried my head would explode.
