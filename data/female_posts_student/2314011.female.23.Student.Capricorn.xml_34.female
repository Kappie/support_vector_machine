But for the last 2-3 weeks, we've seen very little of the big guy, so now when he's out with the blue sky I find myself at the window, looking up and saying "That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."  Kinda like getting out of a mental institution for an afternoon and seeing a streetlight for the first time in a year; at least that's what I've been told.  So today's the big-ass day, on more than one level.  I don't even want to leave the house, but I'm counting the minutes until I do.  Can't sit still long enough to write morning pages, so instead, the computer will get a nice warm up along with my writing skills.  Don't know why I'm flipping out about this particular exam.  Maybe it's because it's the hardest one, the one sure to knock everyone off their chairs, force us back up and deal with it as best we can.  So over-dramatic, I realize.  Could be that it represents the entire two weeks and 4 months preceding it, too.  Yes, we've been on this journey and we haven't turned back, but now comes the last step and it's the most difficult to take.    The boy's watching Return of the King right now.  Wish I was with him.
