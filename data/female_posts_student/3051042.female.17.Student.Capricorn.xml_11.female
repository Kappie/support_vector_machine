I'm usually alone too...  So I went to downtown Ann Arbor and parked at the Washington Street parking structure. Wrote poetry from the top of the building. When it was about a quarter after 9am I decided to head to class. So I drove down about 5 stories and paid 50 cents for parking. Not too bad for an hour of inspirational thinking at high heights.  Have you ever noticed how most foreign people, particularly Middle Eastern, are extremely friendly? I mean, the guys at the BP station are really nice, always complementing me (they want to get in  my pants). But the Indian guy that works for Republic Parking was super friendly. I did my usual "Thank you." Then smiled, then he said something like, "Have a great day," then,"You have a wonderful smile." But I drove off too quickly to reply. People can be wonderfully nice sometimes and I think that's great, especially if someone tries their best to make you smile. And for me that's been an easy task lately.  There's the bell. I'm out.
