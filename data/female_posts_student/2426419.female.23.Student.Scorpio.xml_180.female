I don't even want to work tomorrow.   I think it's living at home. My mom is more than nice to me and she buys me all of this stuff, but I've been at home for five months now. And there are still four more months to go.  It's sort of symbolic  - like a pregnancy. Nine months of waiting for your life to change. I really don't know what I could have done to make this time at home meaningful. Except maybe write a book and get it published. I haven't learned anything, I haven't grown. It's went by really quickly, or maybe I just haven't done anything that would make it seem significant. Perhaps I can think of a few things to define this time I've been at home.  My relationship with Jaci has grown a ton and I have become really involved in Jacob's Well. Jaci and I used to be friends in high school and I can't really remember how close we were just because my whole life before college seems pretty hazy, but we're practically inseparable now. Well,  as inseperable as two twentysomething-year-old ladies still living with their families and still having other friends can be . I don't think she has taken the place of Delisa, but I almost have more to talk about with Jaci than Delisa at this point. Jaci is awesome and I can see why we became friends. And if we weren't such good hanging out friends, I think I would go crazy.  Jacob's Well is a good blessing that happened too. I've struggled soooo much with being disillusioned with churches during college. I went to church all the time in college - a lot more than I do now since I went like three days a week not counting daily chapel - but I was always looking for the perfect church. I know that Jay would hesitate to accept my label, but for me,  Jacob's Well is THE perfect church  (okay, for me and a few others anyway). I love all that Jay gets out of the Bible. I hope that someday I will see a glimpse of what he sees.    Okay, so that's two things.    I guess the love interests/platonic friends in my life have made this period interesting,  but I haven't really had anything amazing happen . I wish that I could have something amazing. I feel that I'm due. I feel like it's more than time. My last amazing relationship was sophomore year and I know that now, since I've matured A LOT since then, my possible new amazing relationship could be even more so if I could find the right guy. I could go into it in detail, but now I'll just say that I'm so much more appreciative of love, I know (or am on the way to finding) who I am, and I live a (relatively) more authentic life. I probably don't, but I feel as if I deserve a summer fling. That sounds so very belittling, but it isn't. I would cherish whomever came into my life, and really respect and adore that person. I mean, I would want respect and kindness and a little committment to be reciprocated, but all that said, I'm ready. So ready, I wonder why it hasn't come yet.  My stomach aches with all the waiting.  Something else good . . . my jobs have been there.   I just need more. I think I will be happy at grad school. Maybe I should have read my Bible more (or at all) during the past five months. I've still felt the love of God and I've still felt as if I were in a relationship, not backtracking or anything, but I've just sort of stayed the same. I don't even know. Maybe I'm just in a slump. Or maybe I'm about to start my period. Maybe I need to read  Tuesdays with Morrie . I picked it up at the thrift store the other day. It's already 1 in the morning. Maybe I need to write. Something important. I need . . . . something. Someone pick me up out of my slump.     But for all the men out there who are attracted to me and want to date me because they think I will bring joy to their lives or entertain them, well just stop it. For the love of all things holy, watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and realize that  I, like Kate Winslet's character, AM NOT A CONCEPT , so stop trying to make me one. No, it isn't your fault, and I have no reason to yell at you, and am not really even yelling at one specific person (more like a medley of them in the past three years), but I want someone who isn't looking for someone to complete them. Yes, I do have the ability to do that, but it's too hard and I just really don't want to. It takes too much work and it's honestly  not worth it .   What was it about Travis that made it so different, eh? He needed someone, but he didn't look to me to entertain him or complete him. He delighted in me, but it was more subtle, it was . . . I don't know what it was but it was good. It gave me a glimpse of . . . let me know that what I need is possible. I don't help the situation with the others; I know that somehow, by showing interest, by giving people chances, I lead them on. I am too sure that every person I meet has something to teach me. I don't want to hurt people anymore. But it gets so lonely looking out the window at all the people passing by, not noticing me. I don't know what I can do to change.   I thought 23 would be a magical year. My golden year, because I was born on the 23rd. I guess it's silly and superstitious. Numbers don't mean anything and signs don't exist. Not the signs I'm thinking of.  I need to be a feminist again.  I need to read books by women, surround myself with fiery empowered women, and say no to anything that remotely resembles a date. I'm so happy when I do that. I need to take bubble baths and listen to angry girl music. I need to . . . .  spew out this deep blue lemonade or rather swim in it. Slash my ankles so I bleed blue lemonade; weep blue lemonade tears, and scream blue lemonade notes. I can do what I want. I'm not a concept. I do not need to be charming. I do not need to be nothing.    I never want to go to sleep again.
