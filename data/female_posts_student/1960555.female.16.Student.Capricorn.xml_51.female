I will announce the arrival of my fine Australian friends                  to anyone who will listen.  They are famished from their long journey 	and request the usual.  I search the cooler for uncooked bacon,                 little soldiers not yet sent to war in                  The United States of Grill.  As I feed my friends, Colonel Grandpa recruits the strips,      	one by one sending them off to a battle they will never return from.   *In Memory of Kip MacDougal-- A friend who was taken from us far before we were ready, not that we ever could have been.*
