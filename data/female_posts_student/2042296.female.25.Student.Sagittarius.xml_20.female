I'm not gonna give in! I have so much to do in the next weeks and I can't afford to become ill.  Well, let's get back in time a little...  My holiday in Finland was ok, but I was so glad to get back home again. It was dark and cold and the people weren't very happy. Their facial expressions were really in connection with the weather. They can't help it, though. The weather is what it is and the life has to go on. Furthermore, I didn't sleep too well in other people's houses and I had the feeling of not belonging there any more. I mean the people were like before and with my family I didn't have any problems, but I don't have the social context I used to have and the people were different. I think some of them were jealous or somehow didn't know how to take the fact that I live now here and they are stuck in Finland. My buddies also had some problems with my not being the same party animal any more. I mean I had fun, but had to skip some parties since I got fed up with the old let's-get-pissed-and-look-silly thing. And I was just exhausted. And I was right once again. It was a heavy experience to hear finnish all around me and see the familiar places again. It's just all too small and too familiar. I also missed Rico like hell and he missed me, too. It was so odd to sleep alone, without him there beside me... But he had a good time with the cats, although he says that the cats missed me, too ;)  So. Finally after a week came the day and I could travel back home again. The flight was 25 minutes early in Frankfurt-Hahn and I had to wait for Rico a while. But when he came, I couldn't help the tears. It was so good to be in his arms again, I was safe again. I mean I really had the feeling of being home and safe again, when I hugged and kissed him. But driving through Schwarzwald wasn't too hilarious. Trucks, trucks and trucks on the highway. It was dark and the highway was so boring! Then, when we finally reached the border and got through the id check, I really felt like home. I was suddenly awake (it was about 5 o'clock in the morning) and happy. We came home and the cats were waiting here... Excited, unable to stay in one place for more than a few seconds. Our bed was so warm and lovely and I slept so good.  Now I've been enjoying my days here at home again and Minka has been my lapcat ;) I love it, how here everything's familiar, but in a different way than in Finland.   Nevertheless, we're planning our common trip to Finland in May. Most likely we're gonna stay 2 weeks (17. - 31.5.) but it can also be, that we're going only for a week. Depending on whether I want to stay there that long ;) And in any case we're gonna travel to Finland once again in August, since Laura (my dear friend) is getting married 14. August. In May we have to pack my things and then the removal company is going to bring the stuff here. So, after that my life is also concretely here.   So, I now have heap loads of paper work to do, since I got the place in the university of Zurich. I'm so glad :) I have to do a german test but it's gonna be fine, I'm sure. I'll just read some german grammar to memorize things (maybe I'll finally finish the book we were suppose to read in Finland on one of the german grammar courses at the university, lol... I mean I had it as my minor, but never really put awfully lot of effort on it, cause I survived with my skills) and read some news papers like Die Zeit and so on. I have to fill out forms and make phone calls to Finland in order to get financial support from the Finnish state. I have to fill out some forms for the Uni Zurich, too. But at least I can study again! What amazes me, is the lack of information for foreign students about how it's going to go on from now on. I would want to know how to plan my schedule and how to choose courses and basic things like where to eat and how to pay the meals! In Finland all foreign students have personal tutors (1 tutor/3-4 exchange students) and the information flow is really amazing! If this is not getting any better, I'm gonna have to give some feedback to those who are responsible for international affairs. I think I'm gonna be a nuisance ;) But I want to know about things and I want information! If that makes me a nuisance, I don't care!  Hmm... What else... Yeah, my friends were here. It was so good to see them again and have a good chat with them. It was so wonderful to talk to real friends (Rico is of course my real friend, too, but I need my female friends, too) and spend some time with them. Although two days went so fast... We went to Zurich to do some shopping and in the evening we just laid on the sofa, drank some wine and other spirits and have good conversations. The feeling was so warm and caring!  Hmm, what else. Nothing special, I guess. We have a lot of love in our lives, I and Rico. So it can't be that bad, right? ;) We've had our difficulties and we're gonna have some more of them, but that's only normal. So far we've got over them and if our love stays this strong, we're gonna get over the future problems, too.  So, I'll go and open my sweet grammar book ;) Till later!
