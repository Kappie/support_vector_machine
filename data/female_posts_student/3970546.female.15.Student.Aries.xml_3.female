Ya know, its really frustrating How there can be so many men in this world and yet there aren't that many for me I walkdown the street and all i see Is hands entwined, lips locked, mirrored smiles Maybe i should just shut myself inside for a while  Okay this is becoming a serious problem Look at me, i mean really look at me Is my hair not cool enough? Are my clothes out of style? Do I not say the cool things like other girls do? Maybe i should just shut up for a while  Guess what! Emotions Suck! What if i found a switch in my brain where i could turn off my feelers and just walk around like a robot Yea that would work for me I'll start lookin for that button right now Maybe I should just wait a little while
