I really recommend you buy it or rent it immedietly. I saw it tonight and I'm buying tomorrow morning. That's how good I thought it was. If you want to rent it, I'd recommend going to Blockbuster, obviously. If you want to buy it, I'd go to Wal-Mart, or if you don't want to leave the house just order it from Amazon.com. I've provided links for the DVD and VHS versions of it:  VHS:  urlLink Click Here  DVD:  urlLink Click Here   Again, I really recommend it. Such a good movie. Well, see ya next time and ttyl. Byezo!
