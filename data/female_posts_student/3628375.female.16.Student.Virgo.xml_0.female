My sister was supposed to take me to go get my depo-shot (birth control) at 11:30am and of course she wasnt awake, so I had to reschedule my appointment and luckily I can go today at 5:00pm, my sister better not screw this up. and then I have to go get my book for my english project that due on the first day of school and I havent even read the book, and I have like 50 questions to answer, and 20 vocab words to define, and AHHH!!!! Crazy, but me always putting things off til last minute, I'll get it done, hehe, or I'm hoping so. But anyways, I think I'm going to start putting some of my poetry on here, but not right now, because I dont have time. Gots to fly. Love ya'll!!!!  ***The biggest things can be done in the littlest time***
