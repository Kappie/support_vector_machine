There's something about it that's just simply wonderful.  It can evoke so many different emotions, that otherwise might be left untapped.  When I was younger, whenever it rained, I would go out on our screened-in porch and just sit there and watch and listen.  I don't believe I could be happy living anywhere that it did not rain at least sporadically.  In this, I take after my dad in his strange ways.  He loves gray skies better than blue, and he likes clouds better than nothing.
