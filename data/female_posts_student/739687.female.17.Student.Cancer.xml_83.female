And you try to act like nothing happens. I hate that feeling. It's the biggest way to be let down. I was just thinking about that...because I've felt like that countless times. And I've learned that wishes won't get you far. Because I've done more wishing then anyone could imagine...and look where am? Everything I've wished for is far from my grasp. Only a miracle could get me satisfaction...and I'm starting to doubt the existence of those too.
