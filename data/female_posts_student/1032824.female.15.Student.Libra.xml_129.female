We recruited quite a number of sec 1s, although fewer than last year =P The Police came down with the police car.. weapons.. display, wow so zai mmkays! Then nana kept fooling around with the policemen! Naughty gal.. haha!! We sat in the car.. and plaued with their weapon.. so cool.. I think this year the NPCC really was the main attraction of the open house! Teehee. We took up part of the area in front of the Technical block, the PE store room area, and the field like last year. Now that Mrs Abdul (Siti) has taken over Mr Lau's position, I believe that CTNPCC will become  tougher... (but I like!) Mr Lau is like super "welfare".. haha. He is nice, but too nice that people take his kindness for granted! =P Mr-Nice-Guy!   So excited to find out our NCO (non-commission officer) post! Sir Bernard knows but wouldn't wanna tell us. *Grrr.. Haha. Just makes me YEARN for next week's training! But I will be going down late sia.. cos Ms Shelley Lau (sp?) wants to give us a history test. And also.. gotta leave with Nana earlier cos we have flag-selling. Boooos =X *Sniffles*  Going for renioun dinner now, tata!
