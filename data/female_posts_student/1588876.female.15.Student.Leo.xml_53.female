"hello addie- i have been watching  you from afar and am interested in you. -your secret admirer w.s."  wow. i totally knew who that was when i read it.   WESLEY MERRITT  silly goose. and no, hes not serious. who would be actually be serious and talk like that? whatever.  today was a pretty ok day. i hate taking japanese. i suck at memorizing shit.  sore wa shitagi desu ka?
