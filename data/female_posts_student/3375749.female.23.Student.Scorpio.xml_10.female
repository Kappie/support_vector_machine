Her family eats there at least once a week. We were there to talk about some things and you know how girls are- we get off the subject and just start gabbing away. Well we got onto the subject of the psychics in Cassadega. Now for those of you not familiar with Cassadega it's a very small section in Lake Helen where all the psychics congregate, so to speak. They have everything there from pet psychics to tarot to palm reading to whatever. It's crazy. There's an old hotel there that's supposed to be haunted too. Well anyways, Susan was telling us how she goes there every so often to talk with a psychic and then Diem piped up and said she goes too. I would tell you the story that Susan told us but I think it might be personal to her, so I won't. It gave me goosebumps. Then Susan showed us some candles that she bought while over there. One of them was labeled money I think and she said that after she got it her husband got a raise. So after we left, Diem and I decided to go into Cassadega to get some of our own. I figure if they don't work, then at least they smell nice. Diem bought 2 and I bought 3. Mine are Good Health, Abundance, and Money. Good Health says, "I believe in the healing powers of the universe and its ability to restore health. May these powers guide me to a state of complete well-being." Abundance says, "May an abundance of goodness flow freely into my life. Allow me to be receptive to the treasures that present themselves, enriching my life's journey." Finally, the money one says, "May prosperity flow freely through my life. I sense a natural attraction to wealth and its comforts. Let me embrace prosperity in all forms." Hey, I could embrace winning the lottery. That would be cool. Now the candles also have an interesting little note on the sides. It talks about "charging your candle". You have to, like, sit outside and will the energy of the magical white light of the universe to protect you. Then you have to say,"Manifest a Miracle! I will it so...So be it!" ...... right . I think I'll just light them and cross my fingers. I'll let you know if they work.
