Add Olivia and we could start a house- er, Blogger party!! :P  To help out the confused, such as Alison, my title scheme is just based on random song titles from Ayu's CDs. (I trust that everyone who knows me well enough knows Ayumi. If not, then you don't know me as well as you thought, did ya??) Speaking of which, I ordered one of her previously out-of-stock CDs the other day and it STILL hasn't arrived! Darn US postal system!! Grrr...  I'm beginning to sound like Jane. :P  I went to the Honors Program set-up today during SRT. (Actually, that would be about 10 minutes ago...) That, as Ash could tell you, was a complete waste of time. I walked in there, sat down with Ash and waited for about 10 minutes while the Top Ten seniors were told where to stand on the stage. Then we were excused. We did  absolutely nothing .   While on the subject of wasting time, I'll continue the trend by posing an incredibly random question. It'll bring out sides of us we had no idea were hidden, and it'll make some people begin to think more. (JANE!) Who knows? We could start a "Question of the Day" type of thing.  Question for May 11, 2004 : When you type, what is the one thing that bugs you most? Explain.  (Don't you love it when teachers ask you to explain events and topics that can't truly be explained??)  My answer : I hate the fact that I can never type "about" right.  Each time, I stick the "o" before the "b" and I usually have to catch myself and correct it. Argh...  That's enough of my talking for today. Time to go around and post comments!! :)  Your mother is an aardvark!
