I went to see the Moscow Circus in action today at Tampines Central. It was amazing! To think about it, those people there eat, sleep and probably even dream the circus- it's their life. These people dedicate their life to entertain others ( of course they will get money and all). They would not have the pleasure of staying putin one place and have a ordinary life like the rest of us. They will always be on the move. It will be a hard life as I imagine it to be.   It's indeed sad thatthe circus profession is slowly dying off. Many are running in a loss and less and less people are interested to join the circus.ButI do really hope that many more generations will be able to enjoy the funandawesome tricks showed in circuses.
