Nothing terribly exciting came of that of course, I got alot done, people were in good moods. It was good considering...  I tried to not think too much about friends, family, school etc...It just can get to be too much.   Tonight Uncle Mur brought Mike, Dad and I out. That was quite enjoyable, I had a fun evening. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed myself like that-doing something I mean.
