We would teach a chant, a cheer, a dance, and then you would have to show some sort of gymnastics ability along with your russian jump   There would be judges and everything and they would rate you on all the categories and then the next morning the scores would be posted on the main office door and it would tell you who made varisty and who made junior varsity. Practices would be after school everyday for about 2 or 3 hours. We would have to run around the track, stretch out, and then we would go over our cheers and chants. We perform them at football games and basketball games. Football was a lot more fun than basketball. We even put together a competition squad which was a lot of hard work but we ended up going to Nationals in Tampa and placed 1st in our division. If you've ever seen Bring it On it looks a lot like that at a competition. People think it's easy to do but it's one of the hardest things I've ever done. I had to learn how to do a round-off back-handspring in a week. That was nerve-wracking....As far as like stereo-typing, you have some of the girls who only try to join the sqaud to be popular, but they usually end up quiting b/c they find out it's a lot more work than they thought(for example you sweat a lot and have to have a lot of coordination and flexibility and strength. You don't just put on a cute outfit, say a little chant and call it a day. Lol. I miss it a lot though. Good times. MTV does some specials every now and then on cheerleading. Those are usually pretty good and gives a real feel for what it's like. My senior year I was given the opportunity to try out for the UCA Coaching team but I never did. I regret that now. But life goes on! I'm not sure I covered what you really wanted to know in this blog, lol, but I hope so!
