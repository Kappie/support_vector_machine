We were playing in the living room when my neighbor knocked on the door, Bob, yeah the thong guy. Anyways, he told me that his wife, Joan, had died from altzimers. It was really sad and then my mom came down. And I told her Joan died, and she said, "Oh Bob, I'm so sorry, you had to put her down didn't you?" And I started screaming, "NO MOM, not the dog, his wife!" And Bob said, "Yeah, not my dog, my wife!" It was so sad but really funny. Thought I'd share that.   5 hours...23 minutes...14 seconds til BLINK!
