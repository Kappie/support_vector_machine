Damn prom, it's making my ears bleed just thinking about it. But yes, it be time to finish things up. And sorry to break topic, but it was sort of urgent so I had to interject.  Ooh one more thing....there's no reservation making at Carrabba's, you have to call on the day of, they don't take anything in advance.....I hate prom. HATE HATE HATE HATE. Heh, peace all.
