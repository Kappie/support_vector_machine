And she said she knew that it'd probably be creepy sleeping at her house alone, especially sinc it's out in the countryish, so I could have a friend or two over at night if I wanted.  No big parties or large groups, but she has a fire pit in her backyard (s'mores!) and all that fun stuff.  So idk... I mean, it'd be cool and all, and it'll give me a chance to get some money.  Plus I'll have my dad's car that week, so it'll be easier to get back and forth from Milton and whatnot, b/c I've got play stuff all that week...  But all of this is dependent on whether or not my wonderful mother agrees to it...  I talked to my dad, and he didn't really seem to care, but he's going to be out of town for the next three weeks so...  Idk, I think my mom will eventually go for it, it just might take a little convincing.  And I don't think she'll let me stay over the whole time, but w/e...  So yeah, if I get to do this, who thinks they'll be able to spend a night or two with me?  Bethy? Lainie? Mande? Nicole? Heathy? Sam? Mystery Person?  I think I'll have.. 5 nights?  I can't remember exactly what she said...  Anyway, I'm just gonna sit and wait for Lainie to call to see if her mom is spazzing or not... Hopefully not, b/c I really do want to talk to her in person about all this Ken stuff...
