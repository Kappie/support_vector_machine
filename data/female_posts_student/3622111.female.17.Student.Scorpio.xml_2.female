Colleen, just finished Form 6 and getting into university this September, Computer Engineering. God. What have I gotten myself into. --" Um. We can talk more about that later though.  Guys, do your own self-intro please.  Settled for the Ringlet for now coz I realized that this blog has actually been created by me when I was experimenting with names. Hm. Well, until any of us comes up with a better idea, this is going to be our blog's name for the time being.  Anyway, we're just some friends who do crazy stuff and laugh at the silliest things, and lately watched too many movies together.  Like today, watched Paycheck and a couple of episodes of Friends.  Man, Paycheck is  good . I mean, seriously. The whole concept and just the whole plot! It's excellent! Of course, not to mention the technology stuff, but I'll have to look up myself to see what reverse engineers are... Hmmm...  Hope this blog is going to last. Hehe.
