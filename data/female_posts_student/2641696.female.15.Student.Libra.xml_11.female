So for now, I'll just fiddle around with it until I think it's beautiful :)   EDIT:   It's not as great as I was hoping, but I'll be changing it some more, especially the description in the right-hand corner.    My name, for all intents and purposes, will be ei :) I'll be using cute little pseudonyms for all the people I know, so that hopefully they won't be able to figure out who I am. I'm a bookworm (especially for Neil Gaiman), a musicworm (especially for A Perfect Circle) and a computerworm (Windows XP, lucky, eh?), but other than that I don't really have any defining characteristics. People say I'm very shy - some say malicious - with/to everyone except my friends and family. Then, apparently I'm very funny. I'm not completely positive about that, but I take compliments when I get 'em.   I've always considered myself to be juvenile compared to most of the people I know, both the same age, younger and older than me. I also think I'm naive compared to the rest of the world, and fairly intelligent, compared to that same world.   Life for me right now isn't perfect, but it's not demonically trying to cut me out of the picture, either. Mostly it's dull, which is sometimes even worse than the latter. I'm sure I'll get through this just like I've gotten through what little else in my life there was to traverse :) My biggest fear/problem is that I don't have anyone who I feel truly close to. Sure, I have my supposed 'best friends,' and I'm sure they think I confide in them. I don't. Normally I don't need another person to talk to, but this utter isolation from people who think they know my deepest secrets is really starting to make me twitch.   Anyways, this is all I have time for, and I'll update as often as I can, but I can't promise anything. Ciao :)
