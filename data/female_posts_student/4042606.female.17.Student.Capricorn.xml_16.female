We can only hope that his attitude of liking everone will not make him weak in points where harsh words are needed. And Edwards is now pitted against the Cyborg Vice President Dick Cheney, They said he would provide a striking contrast to him, though Republicans countered that a debate between the two would be a face-off between sizzle and substance, particularly over the Iraq war, when John Edwards's relative lack of foreign policy experience would be an issue.
