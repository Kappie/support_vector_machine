I think I am going to be sick. Yech...  I have decided that Rach is in fact wrong. The eighties are not scary at all. They are in fact quite wonderful. All the neon clothing and brite lights. And all the fab music. Of course all the AIDS and scary drugs weren't good but there is always a downside to things. Anyway, I think yesterday I may have mentioned that I loved eighties music. Well, I think that my favourite song from the late eighties is We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel. Yes, it is not just a grrreat song but it is also a grrreat history lesson. In grade ten, my history teacher gave us an optional assignment to research every term used in the song. It took ages and ages and ages. Mostly because at that point our computer sucked and the internet did not work properly so I had to go to the library to do my research. But whatever. I am so over that. I think my favourite line is "pope paul malcolm x british politician sex jfk blown away what else do i have to say?" Yeah that is definitely it.   I am writing my erstwhile friends yet another email. I think that they are likely very sick of me by now but I don't care. I need things to do and writing to them is pretty much it. That and writing here and writing stories.  Well, I am going to go watch a movie. That I may or may not have downloaded illegally. We'll say not. I will write more later when I have watched the film. Cheers =)
