Kentucky, here I come! ^^  I've spent almost all day today packing and cleaning up the house XD  I got my shorts, t-shirts, tanktops, shorts, underwear/bra's, and socks packed.  I need to still pack pants and the remainder of the clothes I need, and the stuff to keep me entertained on the 2 day car ride there ^_^  I've got 4 books (Dude, Where's My Country? ~Micheal Moore~, Stupid White Men ~Micheal Moore~, Uncle Tom's Cabin ~Harriet Beech Stow~, and Oliver Twist ~Charles Dickens~), Gameboy Advance, Notebook (I plan to write almost constantly!! I love to write and going on a long trip is perfect for it ^_^),  Camera (taking tons and tons of photos!!)  But, I know this was a short post, but when I get back from Kentucky, the posts are gonna be looooong!!!  XD
