Take work for example.  I love it so much.  The people are great this year.  Convertables- HAHA JAMES!, jokes of the day, speedos (come'n Jake, you know you want them), drive ins, I could go on and on of all the funny things that have happened.  Last year I hated work, this year I love it.  Then there's SMITE.  Planning Alpha and Omega has been fun...kind of...I seem to once again taken a lot of it on myself.  This week I have to teach the lesson for SMITE, finish a ton of stuff for Alpha and Omega, practice the music..AAHHH! I don't have any time.  Then there's my friends.  People who I once loved are bugging the crap outta me, the ones I hated I now love, it's so weird.  I don't know who likes me, who hates me.  This week everything comes together...or so I hope.  I work 10:30-7 every day except Wednesday where I work 10:30-4, SMITE from 5-6, VBS training from 6-8, and music practice from 8-9. Full day.  I really wish Amanda were home.  I need to talk with her a lot.  My relationship with her is weird.  Now, we get along great and I love her to death.  Before was a different story..but I'm gald it's all good now.  I feel like I've called her 100 times in the past 2 weeks lol.  Never sign up for the activities committee for Alpha and Omega= EVERYTHING is an activity!!!  Somehow I got stuck putting together the schedules, and there's so much that still needs to be done.  Amanda has been my other brain on this, and I need her!! All I have to say is that if you sign up for a committee, do your part.  It makes everyone happy in the end.  Don't get me wrong, everyone in the activities group has been great, but some have done a lot more than others.  Well, I just hope it all works out in the end.  Then the whole polo shirt deal.  It's a freakin polo shirt so GET OVER IT!!! Sorry I had to vent.  Well, I have to go get ready for work. This has been my post for the month, I probably won't be back until after the Bahamas trip..busy life.  Pray everything falls into place for Alpha and Omega, because if it doesn't, it lands on us!!
