I have gotten myself all riled up. ugh....anyways...why Illenips where you thinking at dear lovely grams house? I like elvish names, I dont like it when Into that thing brings dead mice into the house, it is disgusting. I opened his mouth with my hands while he had one and one of its legs popped out and I almost started to cry, it was so horrible. it is the little things that make me cry...while pretty much all animal//hurt//dead things make me want to cry...anyways....I am going to go Gaia :)
