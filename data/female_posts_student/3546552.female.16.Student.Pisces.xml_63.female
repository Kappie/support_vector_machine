I went into the art exhibition room and looked for your graphic design...FINALLY, when I found it, I asked the lady if there was a score for any of the art and she said that none of the scores are announced for that until Thursday or Friday. I wish I could tell you...well, I think that you should get an amazing, perfect score...but ya know, not everyone is quite like me...hehe *wink* alright, time to get going, if PJ finds me on the computer again I'm bound not to come home! lol I'll see you soon and talk to you sooner! ngiyakuthanda...or "loke" er whatever...LOL bye bye. ~BS
