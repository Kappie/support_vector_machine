BUT I CANT HELP MYSELF! if i tried to study, nothing would happen. so yesterday i watched  the matrix  instead... =P  lets see... saturday. woke up, tried to do work, and nothing happened, so i watched  the matrix  and afterwards i was all ready to work, and them mom says were going to my aunts house to celebrate my 'grandparents' who arent really, but we call me that... 40th wedding anaversery. so we got there, went to church, and then went back. it was supposed to be a surprise party and when we got there the first time no one had arrived, so we got back and who do you know but DAVY and RACHEL pull up right in front of us. XD!  so we eat, take jennifer hostage and throw pillows at her, then we sit down and watch TV for basically the rest of the party. but then jennifer [annoying little brat that she is] told my mom that i slapped her [which i guess i did, i slapped her on the stomach with my foot and apparently it made a big red mark] but come on, she was the one kicking and biting AND slapping too. before she ran to my mom, she slapped my leg [AND IT HELLA HURT] and i said, 'you're lucky ur my cousin or i'd slap u back' and she was hella pissed, you could tell... how old is jennifer? i think shes like 5 or 6. dude, she weighs more than josh or aaron... and thats not saying a lot because josh n aaron are like sticks.  um... then ya, we watched TV (the frog farted...) and then i went down stairs to get a drink, and tipped a little 'vodka' into my drink. the bottle said vodka, but davy said it smelled like rubbing alcohol... O.o'  i dumped it out and got a new drink... and then our parents said it was time to go... and 20 minutes later they said it was time to go again... and then 30 minuets later they said it was time to go... and finally 10 minutes later, it was time to go. um... um... what else? ya, got home at 12 and i hadnt done ANY studying...   and now i gotta study and make my poster board, and memorize my speech and write my cheat sheet for bio.    shyt, im in DEEP SHYT!  =/ •patty•  p.s. happi b-day to chee.... haha, that rhymes
