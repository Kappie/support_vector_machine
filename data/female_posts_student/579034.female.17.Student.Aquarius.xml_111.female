I think I am really starting to like math. Maybe because I finally get it. I decided I'm gonna do Pre Cal next year and Mr. Leone talked me into taking Physics so, I mean I know for most those aren't too hard of classes but for me they are and I'm gonna take as many hard classes as I can. Notre Dame will be more impressed if I'm making decent grades in hard classes then awesome grades in easy classes, at least that's what I'm telling myself. I just got off the phone with Mickey. Things with him are good. He's comming out here on the 13th and then leaving the 16th. Two days, three nights, it all works out.  It's hard to beleive how far things have flown ya know? It's like, six months ago we were just like friends and now, it's like, we are so much more then that. Like, we aren't that couple that stays together cause of like sexual stuff cause I mean we can't do that stuff. We actually have an awesome like communication thing going on. And it's like, we're each others support system. Like, if he needs me, I'm there, and if I need him, hes like right there, and I mean yeah I have Deb and Erica and alla them, but it's like, I dunno. It's nice to have him there and caring you know? And what I really like about him is he doesn't sugar coat. He tells it like it is and he will get his point accross, but hes not arrogant, he does understand what your talking about. Okay enough about Mick. I know your all sick to death of hearing about him. Sorry. I hate imposing my happiness on people. But, the track meet Saturday should be an adventure. I'm going but I'm not running. It'll be nice to be there for the team. I'm just kinda anxious to get back out there. Today when I was watching the girls running, I SO badly wanted to too.  Tomorrow is Thursday. The week went so fast. Maybe cause I stayed home Monday. Next week should be interesting too. Deb and my birthday is WEDNESDAY! I can't believe we are gonna be 17 Deb. We have come a long way as friends too. It's amazing how everyone is changing and stuff. Like, I got an e-mail from Greg today apologizing and all that. I mean, he said I probably hate him but I been saying since day one that I wanted things between me and him to be cool, so I dunno what he's talkin about. Silly head. Sometimes I wish, ya know, that things could go back to the way they were before all these changes and crap and it's like, now that I think about it, I dont'. I mean, we all grow and change for the better or for the worse. It's like, what the message of J.K. Rowling is, only we can make our own choices, no one can choose for us. IT IS OUR CHOICES AND ACTIONS THAT SHOW WHO WE TRULY ARE, NOT OUR ABILITIES... And I dunno about alla yous but I think thats a pretty gosh darn important message.  Peace x0x
