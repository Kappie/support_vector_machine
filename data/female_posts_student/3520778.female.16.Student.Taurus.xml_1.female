He stripped down to a towel and washed and dried their feet, saying that they need to serve people just as Jesus was serving them.  To not literally wash people's feet, but to serve.    In SF...while I was doing a 'reflection' of some sort, I overlooked when James and Heather washed our feet... I have John 13 outlined in my bible- I wrote how humbling it would be for me to wash my friend's feet for the main reason that I hate feet.  I don't want people touching me with their feet...and I kinda don't want people touching my feet.    God had other plans.    James washed my feet.  Which was a little strange to begin with...I don't think anyone has EVER washed my feet.  Lacy said that it was a humbling experience for her...but I think mine was more of a realization.  Right then and there I realized how much James and Heather do.  That they've done.  This past year has been hard on me spiritually, what with Rob leaving- but I let go of him...and on Thursday night while I watched James and Heather wash feet and pray...I let go of Rob completely.  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.    I don't think I can say this enough- thank you James and Heather for coming to South.
