I waited until 11:30 and left, and then went shopping at Old Navy, Petco, Staples, Office Max, and Linens 'N' Things.       Oh, I'm sorry. Did i say shop? I really meant to say...window shop. Windowshopping is so incredibly boring. Nothing like being so broke you can't buy anything. Ah well.       Oh, And i made the mistake of telling my "friends" who I like. They told him, and he pried it out of me, and he doesn't like me in return.      This day SUCKS.      With love,     April
