Or something of that nature. This in English means " I think I will write in French just to piss Zoe off, but this probably isn't a good idea as no-one wants to land themselves a detention from an intern." If you used an online translator to get the English translation it would not have been correct even if they translated the English into French themselves the translation of French into English is NEVER correct. Believe me I tried myself. I am sorry if I have offended anyone in any way, shape or form. and I was NOT bagging interns or trying to bag them, I don't bag interns I have never bagged interns and I never will. Because Zoe you said that you're doing a thesis? Well guess what...? My mum is doing one as well. So...... Therefore I think it is a good idea to write in a language everyone understands ANGLAIS! I mean ENLGISH. Sorry for any inconvenience .   Australian Exchange Student...(meg)
