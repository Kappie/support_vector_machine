Me and Nathaniel had an interesting conversation about underwear today, it was amusing.  We both hate thong-ish underwear, yay. Our conversation ended up in me telling him for the millionth billionth time that i forgive him, oh well.  At church, me and Mary talked about her excursion to Scarborough Faire, sounded like tons of fun.  She said i should go for the hott guys....hmm this gives me ideas.    Jessi went to Flower Mound prom last night, i hope she had fun!  Robbie, you better have made it fun for her!!  This reminds me of that time when me, charlie and jessi decided that we should go "prom-ing" together....except we'd be really broke, but ya know.  Also this reminds me of my Pre-Prom pact with Jake Ross, in which if i do not get a date to prom from my grade, i take Jake to prom.  lol, we're already planning on it.  Anyways, Jessi promised me pictures tomorrow.    8 more days of hearing Matt McGary's annoying absolutely infernal noise of a voice....i dunno if me and the rest of my English class can make it.  i would like to take this time to say good bye to the people in my classes this tri, like i've done every tri:   English:  the entire class....even matt mcgary!!  i love you all, you all crack me up!!!!
