Well after we left the house I had to go turn in some applications and then it was off to Ryans. Ryan had some unfinished chores he had to do so we waited for him to do them . Then we left and it was off to get Renee and Jeff. We got them and then we went to Main Event. when we got there bowling was to much money. So we eneded up playing alot of games. Me and Ryan played air hocky and he beat me. Then we took some pictures in the booth but we didnt know it was taking our pictures so they were all of us kissing.      Me being a brat was telling Ryan that I wished we had taken goofy pictures. So being as sweet as he is and having a spoiled girlfriend he went and we took more. Then when we were done the pictures came out cute as can be. We then played another game of air hocky and this time I won! hehe...I think he let me...but who cares I still won. ME and Renne played ans I won that game too. She just sucked. lol.     Then Ryan tried to win me a BIG spongebob stuffed animal but he was unlucky that is ok though I love him and the sponge bob was hard to get.      After that we dropped REnee and Jeff off and me and Ryan left. On the way home Ryan was hungry so he stopped at Taco Bell. Knowing that I was on a diet he bought goood foood. That was ok I didnt even ask for a bite! We came back to my house rented THE WASH and ate dinner. Then he left and I was sad. But before left he showed Kendyl how to do a cart wheel. MAN WAS IT CUTE! hehe...well its off to bed. G'night!
