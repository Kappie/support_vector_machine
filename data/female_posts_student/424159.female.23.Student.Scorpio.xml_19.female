"She Loves Me Not" - Papa Roach [LoveHateTragedy]   When I see her eyes look into my eyes Then I realize that she can see inside my head So I close my eyes thinking that I could hide Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head The situation, is to adjatation if she cut me off Would this be an amputation? Chorus: I don't know if I care I'm the jerk, life's not fair Fighting all the time This is out of line She loves me not, loves me not! Do you realize I won't compromise She loves me not, loves me not!  Over the past five years I have shed my tears I have drank my beers and watch my fingers fly away Then until this day you still swing my way But its sad to say sometimes she says she loves me not But I hesatate to tell her I hate This relationship I walked out tody this is over  (repeat) Chorus Life's Not Fair I'm the jerk!  Line for line, ryhme for ryhme Sometimes I be writin' all the goddam time It's makin' me sick Relationship is gettin' ill This your stupid man On the real, could you feel What I feel, what's the deal girl We're tearin' up each others world We should be in harmony boy and girl That is a promise we made Back in the day You told me that things wouldn't be this way I think we should work this out 'Cause all I didn't mean is to scream and shout  (repeat) Chorus  Life's not fair! Life's not fair! Life's not fair! I'm the jerk! Life's not fair! She loves me not! Loves me not!   "Hold Me Down" - Tommy Lee [Never A Dull Moment]   i don't make everyone happy... but it's ok..  i've been through this before  it's nothin new.. nothin new   i don't know why everytime i wanna fly  somebody always tries  to hold me down... hold me down...  i'm losing my faith every single time i try  no one is on my side  don't let me drown... let me drown   don't worry about whatcha done now cause it's ok  it's a test to see how much you can take.. it's nothin new   i don't know why everytime i wanna fly  somebody always tries  to hold me down... hold me down...  i'm losing my faith every single time i try  no one is on my side  don't let me drown... let me drown   i am drowning... i am sinking... yeah    More tomorrow...
