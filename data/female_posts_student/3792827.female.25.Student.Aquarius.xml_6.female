I would rather not set myself up again. I don't need anymore knives in my back.      The kitten is doing pretty good now. He plays a lot. When I first got him, he would just lay around and look pitiful. He's doing MUCH better.      Ok,am I the onlygirl that plays CounterStrike CZ? (If you play,let me know)Come on... I don't even play against other online players because people get pissed when they find out they were owned by a girl. haha It's been a while since I played online. I'm trying to start playing again. It gets old playing against bots.I don't play near as good now because I haven't been playing it much. Soon I'll be Beta Testing. :)      Anyway, I have a lot I have to do for the rest of the week, so if I don't post anything here... it's more than likely because I'm busy. In the near future I'll be doing some slight mods here. I'm sick of the ordinary template. I'm just gonna make it look more "me".
