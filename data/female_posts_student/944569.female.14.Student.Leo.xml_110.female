At night i stare at my bedroom ceiling with thoughts peppering my mind.  I'm crying inside.  Why do we humans forget so easily?  Can we really lose feelings so quickly?  I want to forget.  I want to forget but the memory stays in my mind.    I think of it 24/7.  It makes me want to cry more.  What is this feeling?
