Then I babysat for a couple hours then went back over to Wades and watched the end of Rat Race and talked. Greg was still there and I made him pop my back. Then I came home to find no Julie so I tracked her down to Kayla's house and decided that it wan't far that my little cousin doesn't have a curfue and I do so I went over there. Kayla and I wresled. I did VC shots then around 4:00 I fell asleep. I woke around 3:00 and we went shoping. I then came home and made plans with Celest to disk golf Monday at 4:30. I made  urlLink vegan cookies  for Kendra and went rollerblading but couldn't find Julie and Kayla. So I came home and took Kendra her cookies and strated talking to you all. The point: I give people food but if I gave them more and ate less I would be skiner and I could wear the cuter smaller jeans.
