More specifically, I'm interested in posting some ideas frequently and find out, if they were solved or not. Getting in contact with other people who share the same hobbies and interests is a real benefit and will hopefully turn out to be great fun.   Anyways, enough thoughts for the beginning. Let's start playin' around.   Bye,  Jane.
