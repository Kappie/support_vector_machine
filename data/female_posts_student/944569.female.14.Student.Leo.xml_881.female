The Dj was bad so hardly anyone danced, but, because the place was so big, matthew, terry and i went elsewhere then the dancefloor. We sort of made friends with the bouncers. they were stalking us. wherever we went he was behind us.Then matthew and terry decided to double team me so i took those plastic coctail swords and defended myself. Several times i seeked refuge behind the bouncer.Finally, daniel came and helped matthew and terry, they cornered me, and i was dragged down some stairs, and then i was held down by matthew and daniel and poked so many times by terry with a plastic sword for revenge. There was a food fight at the beginning with jelly beans. David, neil, jamila and i wer all throwing them at fraser who was being showered on with jelly beans.There was one person who kept on shooting spitballs at neil and david, so when they finally cought him, well, u can imagine. Fraser stupidly threw a jelly bean at a bouncer who got mad at fraser. there was also an ice sculptuer, it was awesome.I got 8 airbrush tattoos on me, though there alrdy starting to wear off.
