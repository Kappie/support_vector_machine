Apparently...Sam is calling me this weekend...Wanting to see if I want to met the "mysterious guy"  Anyways...What was the result of the UMSU election?  I think next time I predict something...I don't predict a negative result. I feel bad 'cause what if the prediction was right? And they lost? Well...I guess if I want to satify this curiosity I could run a check on the website. I guess I'll just wait it out.  Mr. Clark bitched at me. Told me to shut up and do my work. I told him he was rude to me later in the day and he said he was sorry and hugged me. This man looks like Karl Marx, and he huggged me. Ah jeezus! And Lukie..."Do I have to come to this meeting?" (He's a teacher) "I'm just going to sit in the car and test tobacco and eat tacos"   I'll be back later with maybe thoughts of wisdom.
