((Yawns and stretches a little)) Well, I sucessfully went almost a full day before making yet another spectacular entry in my new found obsession; blog... its slighlty evil and addictive, but fun none the less.. lol.. I suppose you could say that I thoroughly enjoy having a place to just sit down, type and let everything hang loose.. a place where I can be me.. without the fear of everyone and their brother in my hometown looking into it and bombarding me over the phone the next day about what I typed... To be honest though, I'm slightly tempted to tell Mr. J about all of this blog goodness... or a number of my other friends... While it'd be a nice place for all of us to converge at the end of the day and read about one anothers thoughts, it'd also rob me of yet another place where I can just be myself.. no walls.. no barriers... ((looks out at you all.. or few)) you all dont know me.. and even if you did, I dont think you'd be able to place a face with the words which seem to spill endlessly from the tips of my constantly moving fingertips... no offence, but its not like I'm going to post a wee bitty pic of myself anytime soon.. (lol.. I hate haveing my picture taken.. I always either look like a complete and utter goob or like I just rolled out of bed, hit the wall and fell to the floor in a blanketed mess- drool abound and hair akimbo... lovely no?) anywho though, today was a semi-uneventful day in the life of the currently unemployed Ultimate Cynic Woman... I rolled out of bed this morning at about 11 (yes, I  finally  managed to roll out of bed before 1pm.. what??? its summer and I'm unemployed... give me a break here people) anywho though, being the lazy bum that I am, I pulled on my favorite pair of levis (note- so favorite it might be time to retire the poor dears... they discontinued the style though!! fuzzy shmucks... grr) and a red cami.. (ooh- lacey  and  silky... seexay.. rrrow... kididng) no makeup.. nada.. which is odd for me considering I view myself as a horrid pale mess without some sort of foundation on... ((laughs slightly)) yeah, I know, I'm odd.. but you probably already guessed that by now, havent you? In any case though, I wound up stumbling downstairs after whipping up my hair into a semi-decent bunish thing (my skills with hair are nill.. its either up or down.. always a slight mess- which is sad.. I have nice hair..) I walked outside after spying my mother standing out by our 1989 Ford Festiva and looking at our house like a psychotic rennovation nut (not saying that she isnt one or anything) to find Mr. J stumbling across the street to say hey.. heh.. he had woken up about 30 minutes before I had and was still groggy.. ahwell, he's cute when he's groggy.. all scraggly hair and brownish green eyes.. ((smiles)).. Anywho though- I feel like the uber paranoid spaz queen of the universe now.. to find out he got off at 4 yesterday as planned, and then spent time with his  family ... oy... and here I was thinking he just didnt want to say hey.. eck.. yes, I felt like a wee bit of a rat.. after that little explanation we elected to go on a quickie bikeride to the store and back for green onions..nearly collided a couple of times, but it was fun.. he then went to work and I lounged about the house for the rest of the day untill I decided to go on another bikeride before he got home from work.. ((smiles)) come to find out, there arent many streets in Podot.. I wound up going down many of them twice.. it's sad.. really really sad.. it was nice though- being out on my own and being able to decide where I wanted to go by myself.. mostly on a whim.. at about 10ish Mr. J got home and we spent the rest of the night on the couch watching cartoons (one of the many things I love about him- 10, 15, 20 years from now I know that when I walk into the living room in the mornings, I'll find him on the couch watching cartoons and eating a bowl of cereal..I love the fact that, while he knows when to be serious, he also isnt afraid to still be a kid at heart) he wound up going home at 11ish (an hour- I know... but to find out you can do alot in an hour.. ((smiles)).. man alive.. lol.. no, I'm not telling you what we did- I'll leave it to your imagination) ((yawns slightly and stretches again)) overall though, it was a pretty good day.. ((looks up at the entry)) eck.. this is getting long and I have to be hopping... sorry about the babbling.. ~Megs
