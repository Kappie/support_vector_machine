Went shopping today. It wasn't a huge power shopping trip, but I got some things I needed. A khaki Tommy skirt I can wear to school when it's warmer and some cute Tommy khakis, but they're too long. I tried them on for Mamaw at home and she said it would be hard to hem them, so we're going to Paducah tomorrow to see if we can find them in regular instead of long lol. And then I got a baseball type shirt from Gap that's green and says "Brooklyn" on it. It's cute.  Caitlin, Jack, AND Caroline's birthdays are all this week! Hehe. Caitlin is on Monday, Jack is on Wednesday, and Caroline on Thursday. Pretty neat.
