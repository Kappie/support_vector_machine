You sit in a circle and there is a tray with a hat, scarf, two oven mits, two forks, and a heavily wrapped giant Hershey bar in the middle. You pass around 2 dies, and whoever rolls doubles has to put on all the clothes, take the forks and rip the wrapping off the chocolate bar. They then commence to try and cut up the bar and eat it. All the while everyone else is still trying to roll doubles. We played this game twice, and between the two games I ate about a whole giant candy bar. I am so sick of chocolate! At one point I had so much chocolate in my mouth at one time I couldn't breathe and my up-chuck reflex started to kick in. Not a good combination, but I'm alive. We also played the bubble gum game. This is where you have a plate in front of you. On the plate is one piece of bubble gum, generally bubble yum because it is bigger than normal gum. Whoever eats the gum and blows a bubble first wins...but there a catch. The piece of gum is buried underneath a  huge  mound of whip cream. My parents say I'm not American just because I don't like whip cream, but I don't care. I hate the stuff with a passion, and yet I have a very strong natural instinct to not lose. A very strong competitive streak in me I suppose. Anywho, needless to say I toughed it out, and came in a close second, but I'm still satisfied with that. However, as we were sitting there just chewing our gum, the girl next to me says "hey andie" as if wanting to start a conversation. I turn to look at her, and just as I opened my mouth to say "hey what" a whole plate full of whip cream lands in my face. It was so disgusting! I was pissed to the max. I threw my plate at her and it got all in her hair and on her shirt. It also got all over the floor too. We were forced, against child labor laws I'm sure, to clean up the mess, but we laughed it off afterward. But don't think for a minute that I'm not gonna get her back even worse for what she did. I also have a rather strong revenge streak in me too.  Oh, yeah, and my leaders are gonna get it too. As we all were stuffing our faces with chocolate, and as I was getting a face full of whip cream, they were taking pictures! Gaaaaa!!! Evil gits. Oh well. If I get any copies I might post them, but then again I might burn them. I dunno. I'm still really hyper. I need something to do. I might go burn about ten of my candles at one time in my room. Fire is fun.....
