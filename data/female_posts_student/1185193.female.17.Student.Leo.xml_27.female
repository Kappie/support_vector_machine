In the dressing rooms, there is a sign posted that says, "We are watching you.  Shoplifting hurts everyone."  Riiiiight.  Anyhoo, we have to wear afros in this number  in our attempt to look, act, and dance like the black family.   I am supposed to be the father of the family.  Here is the afro I chose:     Can't you imagine it now?  It will look so flattering on me.  I just feel wierd like not having dark skin and wearing an afro.  It reminds me of Michael Jackson.  *shudder*  Anyhoo, it should prove to be an interesting performance.
