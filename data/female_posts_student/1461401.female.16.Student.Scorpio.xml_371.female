There must have been as many fireflies as there were stars, and a warm breeze blew puffs of clouds across the deep blue sky. The only fault I can find is that it had to end, and now I'm here blogging with a dreamy expression on my face and my eyes half closed, trying to capture the smell and the taste in my mind as well as the sounds and the wonderful sight. And the feel. The texture and the warmth. *sigh* There is no word in any language that I yet know that seems right enough to describe this. I think "euphoria" is about as close as I'm going to get. or...   Delicious.
