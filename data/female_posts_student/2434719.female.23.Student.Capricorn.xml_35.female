But the wedding sure was nice ;)  Oh okay, so let's see, I finished my presentation! I did a test run to rocky the racoon last night, and he seemed to like it. And it was the exact time so I need to work on that, I don't want to go over 30 minutes... not only will I be over, but my classmates might punch me.  run on, run on... ooooprah. (that has so many meanings.. hmm who gets it? kentesheia!)  as far my PR update (i'm sorry people school is my life for the next three weeks)... going well! we have a 25 page paper to split between the group.  but i am genius! i had a great idea.... we split it up, between us, and we write detailed outlines. and then one person will put it all together into one paper. so it has one voice, so it will flow.  and luckily, i'm smart but i'm not that smart cause everyone else had that idea too :) i finished mine last night, and i just have to type it up and email it to her.  then, we have a meeting with our prof on wed, we're going to disucss our final presentation, and also give her lists of EVERYTHING each of us has done, including a tally of each task and how long it took to do them.  goodness. that's a list right there.   NY TiMES HERE I COME... err well...THE ONION HERE I COME!  i am so excited about next semester! two of my profs are pulitzer prize winners! how great is that? i'm going to take media management, reporting techniques, readings in mass communications, and media ethics.  you may thinking, wait a second, twelve hours??? no way.  OH YES WAY. well at least i think so. we'll see :).  (for those of you who don't know, 9 hours is full time for grad students).  i'm crazy!  well hey do you know what tomorrow is? TOMORROW TUESDAY... CLEANING TUESDAY. that's the day i clean, only tomorrow will be insane. i'm going to do ALL the laundry. do you hear me. ALL of it.  and i am going to vaccuum. and i am going to vaccuum my mattress too! YES YOU HEARD ME. and maybe buy new pillows and sheets. and i'm going to clean the toilet! (i hate doing it so it's worth mentioning.) ew!  it's the bed thing and the laundry that makes it a long day. i'm going to clean the kitchen too, and dust and tidy up, but i do that every week anyway...  i am such a dork.  later gators, gotta get to work.
