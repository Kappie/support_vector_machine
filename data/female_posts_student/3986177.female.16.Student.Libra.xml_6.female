Today started off as a usual Sunday. I had hockey training nice n early in the mornin. I swear it was soo cold I didn’t wanna wake up. Grade 1 had the entire field to ourselves today. It was mad doing all those crazy drills. Push, dribble, throw, turn, hit, trap, lead, through, deflect, jab, tackle, backtackle!!! Haha it made me so tired. My dad forgot to pick us up because he was playing golf while we had training so we got to watch a first grade uni game. I swear it was so fast n so impressive. They knew exactly wat they were doing n had game plays n everything!! All we have is the tornado, peanut butter and walrus. Walrus is da best tho! We do a fake pass through one of our playas n BAM in da goal. Well that’s wats supposed to happen newaiz. Afta hockey training I had to go straight home cuz we were gonna eat out at yum cha with my family. I had to leave half way (which sux cuz I was hungry!!) cuz I had to meet up with my kloz ncounta buddies at rooty hill at 3. We had an audition to perform in the Miss Teen Philippines pagent. I walked into  martin prinze  on da platform at parra station which was cool cuz I wasn’t a nigel nemore. This dude is da bomb. He jus came to support us n ended up dancing cuz we were missing richard.  Karen  looked like a million bucks all dressed up in her heels and bling bling and  martin c  got a haircut which looks very sexy indeed =) jus thought I might mention that. Oh n  richie , the bumhole, lost the beanie that I made for him n now he wants another one -_- well buy me wool n I will! We got rides off sum very nice people to da venue. Haha well that’s a whole different story in itself… we were somewhere in da middle of rooty hill, dancing on a large slab of concrete with a main road just metres away. What kinda audition is this? That’s wat we were all asking ourselves. Oh n the ground was dirrrty… I sound like da biggest priss in the world rite now but trust me, even the boys didn’t wanna get down… We had a really quick run through n then performed as best as we possibly could. Honestly it was the most underpracticed performance yet n we thought we made fools outa ourselves but guess wat?! WE GOT IN!! dunno how that happened but its allll goot =) Go us! Then I went to parra with  joanne  for a bit. Poor girl, her parents forgot all bout her n she didn’t know how to get home plus she forgot her wallet!! so we had sum food n then sat at da bus stops talkin. Hahaha JOMER!!! Rofl… newaiz my bus came eventually n she was gonna get picked up so I jus went home. Now I’m sittin here typing =) On a sadder note we lost our hockey game this Saturday =( 3nil. Its ok cuz we got a second chance to be in the grand finals cuz we’re coming second in the ladder. We’ll kick butt next week, yeh? That’s why we’re training so hard… hrmm I took a few fotos so I mite put them up. Thanks  darius  for watching! Ur not very vocal but I’m sure u were cheering for us internally =)  That’s all from me for today! Laterz aligatorz…. - Luv ella
