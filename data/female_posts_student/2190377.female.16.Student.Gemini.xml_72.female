I'm unable to sleep right now and am talking to Max who is also struck with insomnia. weeeeoooohwwweeee  Max is a cool kid even if he would rather not admit it.  Yesterday I spent most of the day with my brother which was cool. We went to Potbellies and his friend Stephanies house where i played with her whacko dogs.  she had this really senile sausage dog that would like snarl at you and then forget about it and start licking you... nonstop.  He was cute though.  ALSO SHE HAD A DOG NAMED WALLACE. TOO COOL.    then we went to the gym. i cant move the armmmsssss aaaaagh.  bought clothes for brian afterwards which was surprisingly fun.    i am sooo sore today from falling down a lot and the gym and shit.   man im not very witty at 6am.    dammit where is my other earring. and my other flip-flop.  and who left their flip-flops at my grandmothers house man.
