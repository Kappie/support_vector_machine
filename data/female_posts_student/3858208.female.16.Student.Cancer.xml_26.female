This is an apology both to the few people who read this and to myself. I'm afraid that life has been so incredibly hectic lately that I haven't had time to even think in complete sentences.  I've been trying to get my schedule for school for the past two days. I finally got it this morning. How frustrating it was to walk all over school just to get a piece of paper, a temporary ID, and six heavy-ass books? Very. At least my very good friend Mariah was there to hang out with me.  Speaking of the crazy Pariah Mayne (Mariah's nickname; long story), I'm going to be taking care of her 7-week-old Australian Shepherd for a week starting on Saturday. It's sure to produce many silly stories, as we already have a nine-month old puppy and a [very playful]  five-year-old Golden. Oh, dogs, how I love thee.  I just re-read this post and realized how extremely unimportant it is in the grand scheme of things. I'm sure it's also only interesting to me, but feel free to tell me about your pets. =]    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  confused  listening to/watching ::  well my sister's watching Boy Meets World  eating/drinking ::  chewing gum  craving ::  nothing  talking to ::  Chelsea  thinking about ::  Ryder Strong is cute!  wishing ::  that I had more people in my classes.  wearing ::  jeans and a t-shirt that says "SWEET N' SOFT Be-Be's Sticky Buns - you'll be teased with one squeeze"  random ::  I hate registration.
