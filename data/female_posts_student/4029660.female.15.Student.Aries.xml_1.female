Thank god! Anyways not much has been happening. Just alot of school work and so on. bloody school work. I bought 2 books. 1 of them is called illuminated manuscripts-its about the art during the middle ages i guess i found it interesting, and the other book is called Enochian Magick - im in love with anything Enochian. Thanks to Seb for that because he introduced me to it. Its abit confusing though coz there are 4 Watchtowers for the elements yet they have it in Enochian language i kind of know some of the words but when you have a look at it - doesnt really make sense to why they have it there. Anyway i bought some fabric for my pants for fashion design. Im going to put these little butterflies on it and i got lips but im not sure where im going to put them at the moment. I have this blue laungerai (dont know how to spell it!) kind of fabric im going to put it at the bottom but my mum says i should make a belt. I just want them to look different since almost eery girl wears em and im sick of looking at them! Well i must head off. Homework to finish and sleep to catch up with! CYA!
