I haven't had that much fun with a book since Harry Potter came out!  (WHAT?!)  It felt good picking up a book for pleasure.  It's been awhile.  It was so hard to concentrate on any casual reading besides the occasional Entertainment Weekly when I was in school.  It felt so foreign to me then.  I have about 3 books that I started that I have yet to finish.  Gotta pick those up next.  Then all the books I've gotten as gifts that I havent read.  Then, onto the public library and see what they've got to offer me.  YAY, BOOKS!
