"WHAT?! You were supposed to remind me when it was 7!!" "Really? Sorry man." "What am i supposed to do now?! It takes like half an hour to get there!!" "Not if you drive fast," suggests Mickey. "Err.. ok. Well I gotta go shower now. Shall I wear green t-shirt or black?" "Green." "Black. "Man, you can't wear a t-shirt!" Ryan exclaimed frantically. "Why?" "Cos you're going on a  date ! Nobody wears t-shirts on a date. You'll never pull." "The man is right," says Jesse. "You gotta wear a  shirt !" says Mickey, laughing, and then realising he didnt even make a joke. "Oh man.. I don't have a shirt!" "What do you wear to work then?" "Erm, t-shirts." "God." "Well i'm gonna go shower now. Can somebody lend me a shirt?" "Yeh, sure." Adam runs off to the shower. About 30 seconds later, he reemerges with a towel around him.  "So where's the shirt?" "Sorry man, the only one I got left is this one," Ryan says, holding up a salmon coloured shirt. "Dude! It's PINK!" "Yeh, I know man, but it's the only clean one i got left." Adam lets out a rather disappointed burp. (hehe) "Fine." He puts on the shirt and retreats to his room to put on his trousers (which was a sensible idea.. you know.. not changing in the living room...)  Oh crap. Only 5 minutes left to do my hair? How am i gonna manage that??  He thinks frustratedly. So he pours a handful of gel and manages to get his hair semi-done. And out he rushes.  Every bus, every train, Ever cab, every lane is JAMMED
