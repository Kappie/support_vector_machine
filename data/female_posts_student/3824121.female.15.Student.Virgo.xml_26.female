School is starting soon, so I need to make up my back to school lists and stuff and sign away my free days. I don't get it. I don't wanna go back to school, but I don't wanna stay here. I wanna go! GO! You know? And get out of here. Out of this god damned hell hole.  In other news, my nephews birthday party was yesterday. I didn't have that much fun. It was sort of boring to me. And my nephew pissed me off before the party, so that was also kind of bad to me. And my head hurt. I had so many excuses and so little time. I need to go read some yaoi and calm my haggard nerves.
