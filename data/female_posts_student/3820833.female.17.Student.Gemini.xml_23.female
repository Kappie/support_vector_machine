For the last few days, I did not stay back in school anymore. I take the bus home after the school dismissed. I take a nap after I reach home. I feel better after some sleeps. Guess what? I could study until 11:30pm after I took the nap in the afternoon (I usually go to bed at 9:30pm last time) without feeling tired at all! How amazing. Hope this could help me.   Nothing much happen these few days. Study, study and study, nothing more activities besides that. I think life is getting boring. Haih… Today, we learnt about the function of our brain during the biology lesson. My teacher told us that females are actually smarter than the males. Haha! I agree with it. My teacher said the females’ left-brain and right-brain have closer connection. They are better in expressing their feelings and thoughts. That’s the reason why females are accused that they are very emotional. Not like guys who are always keep the feelings with themselves and sometimes not even know how to express their feeling. What do you think? Hehe…  I think I have to stop here. I've to prepare the dinner now.If not my mother will blames me again. Tonight I will have some fish for dinner. So, I've to fry them now. My dinner night (Form 5 graduation dinner) will be held on next Friday. Looking for it. =)  P/s: Just for your information, I apologized to my god-brother since I think I was wrong when I treated him madly without thinking his feelings. We are still brother and sister now. My relationship with my mother does not improved much as she points her finger at me repeatedly for some mistakes that were actually not caused by me which are really irritated me.   p/s 2 : Why my classmates like to think that me and my god-brother have some unknown relationship leh? Is there really no pure-brother and sister-relationship in their eyes? Do you know what they would defend themselves from this question? They will give me this answer : "Yes, I believe. But not for you and your god-brother" HUH? Why? tell me why....
