I wonder why can't they understand me better?    Anyway... I'm having lots of complicated feelings recently. I'm a little confused... Sometimes... I think that there's no point waiting for the answer to my qns... it's really testing my patience and I'm tired of it. Maybe I should try to accept the love and care another is willing to shower on me... or maybe I should persevere and wait for time to tell... these things are happening too quickly... too fast for me to comprehend.  My heart is a little lost too...  However, I think that  this could be part and parcel of our life... and inexplicable feelings just pop by... I believe that I'll be able to walk out of it soon.... yes.
