I'm making so many spelling mistakes (not that you would know, I correct them all) and it's like I can't talk! I mix up words, letters, anything. I guess I'm just a little tired. I'm worried about thursday and friday. Finals. Ugh. Oh well, after that nothing but rest, relaxation, and watching lilly. For the rest of the summer. I know some friends and I are supposed to get together sometime soon and go see the Matrix again, but I don't know when that's going to happen. Nothing planned nothing planned, lalala, nothing planned :-D That's just the way I like it. I'm sure sometime this summer I'm going to go visit dad (which will be cool) and I'm still hoping Katie or Emma (or both) can come up and see me. Other than that... I got nothin :-D ~I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after~ Me
