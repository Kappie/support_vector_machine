Great pay, great environment, people here are very nice. No hard labor but just use your tremendously knowledge and skills. In control of the typing department, tells people what to do and what not to do. I’m known as the bossy trouble maker.   Answering calls from clients regarding to their policy corrections and returning their calls if needed. I have to deal with finding files and be very politely to the clients. I’m going insane because there’s so much for me to do.  I realized that I would roll my eye balls at the computer screen when ever the phone rings. Shesh, I hate this job!!! I loved it before but now I hate it. Let me say this one more time I Hate This Crapy Job Fuck. I hate to deal with people, I hate to correct people’s mistakes. I feel like yelling and screaming. I feel like taking the day off at this very vicious moment. Shit, this is stressing me out damn it.   Intentionally I’m still in control! Sakdary rules! YEAH BABY!
