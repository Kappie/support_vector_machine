I will be at a performance of Mama MÃ­a on Sunday night.  Pretty pretty please!  On a side note, do you think Sloane is Syd's father?  My mom and I have been predicting that since season one because he has always said how he thinks of her as a daughter.  And I'm sorry, but Sloane and Dr. Barnett?  Umm, no.  And what's up with this year's season?  There have been barely any episodes because of all the Emmy/Golden Globe crap.  The new episodes are supposed to air continuesly for the rest of the season.  *fingers crossed*  Let me know if you will tape it...
