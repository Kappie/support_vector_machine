Just got back, they lost 5-2, but the highlight was before the game when they had a 1974 team reunion. It wasmuch better than when they had the 1989 last month when only two (TWO!) players showed up (Dave Henderson and Carney Lansford). Most of the other players showed up. As I write this, the Giants lead 1-0 in the middle of the fifth. Jason Schmidt's pitching for the Giants, Aaron Cook for Colorado, bonds is 0-1 with a walk
