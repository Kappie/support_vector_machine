I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    And here I was worrying about being old...not that I'm not, but that's a really good morale booster tharr.
