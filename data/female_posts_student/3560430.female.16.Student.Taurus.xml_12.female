And tuna. I realized that last week I watched approximately three hours of t.v. That's totaling the amounts I watched while glancing.   I got Bethie to set up my I-mood, I'm very proud of it. Now I have to get her to set up that nifty book thing. Very cool. I'm contemplating getting dressed, kind of. Probably in different P.J's but that is the beauty of summer vacation.   I watched The Killer Tomatoes Eat France or something to that effect. That is a frigging hilarious movie! Almost up there with Rocky Horror Picture show... Maybe with a few more musical sequences.   If you haven't gotten it I plan on doing Jack this weekend. Next weekend I have to work on east Hastings and Main. I'm doing it for work experience. Did you know it has more knifeings and AIDS/hepatitis cases per capita than any other place in North America (I'm pretty sure that that includes Mexico). No my work experience is not being a hooker, it's working at a woman's shelter. My dad plans on walking me to and from the door. He's very nervous about it all. I kind of am too. But I figure I should be Ok.   P.S. I love that Simpsons.
