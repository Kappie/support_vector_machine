I saw like 2 people walk in in weird clothes and if that wasn't enough I walk in the front door and 80's music is playing on speakers THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD!?! Yeah it took me a good couple of minutes to realize it was 80's day, definititely didn't see that one coming. Anyways that started my day off pretty interesting. We should have music play everyday, it was really uplifting.
