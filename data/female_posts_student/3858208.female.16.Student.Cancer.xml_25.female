Today's mood weather ::  mostly sunny  This is going to be a very short post, as I'm busy following Windy around, making sure she's getting along with our dogs and not peeing in the house. Things are going well so far, Windy is extremely well-behaved for being only 7 weeks old, and her and Zeus are already starting to play somewhat. For some reason, Scarlet isn't too fond of Windy. She's tolerating her, but I think that's about as good as it's going to get. Oh, well, at least they aren't fighting.  Well, I'm off to eat my dinner. I have several funny stories I'll try to post tomorrow sometime.    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  Hungry!  listening to/watching ::  nothing  eating/drinking ::  about to eat dinner  craving ::  nothing  talking to ::  Chelsea  thinking about ::  the dogs  wishing ::  nothing...  wearing ::  jeans and a "Bored of Education" t-shirt (get it?)  random ::  I'm tired. *yawn!*
