I am not a very accurate or fast typer so any post of mine will not be of the length and quality of daughter number one.  Here we go…..  My thoughts on why I love San Miguel.     ·	The weather .. it’s as close to perfect as any place I’ve ever been.  Yesterday was typical, a bright clear day with a high temperature of 82 degrees and very low humidity.  Last night it got down to a cool 55 degrees absolutely perfect for sleeping with the windows open.    ·	Waking up at sunrise…. Well Listening to San Miguel awake at sunrise is more appropriate.  The random ringing of a church bell off in the distance, the song of the birds as they greet the day, a far off rooster cry, the work truck as it clanks down the cobblestone street,  the tinkling of our fountains as the water responds to gravity’s pull, the peaceful glow of the sun as it illuminates my bedroom through our skylight….. Heaven help me I do love it so.  ·	The freedom this place affords my children.  They get to experience childhood as I did for a short time.  There is virtually no crime, so they are free to leave and wander about all day long without any worries.  At night a curfew is all that is required, no need to document their every move.  What have we done to America?   With all our wealth and affluence, perhaps the truly important qualities of life are missing.  ·	A maid, cook, pool man, and gardener, did I mention our own personal cook……..nuff said.  ·	Doing nothing or doing one small thing at a time.  I cannot accurately describe how the pace of life here is soooooooooooooo much slower than at home but it really does re-charge my sole.  ·	Spending time with my kids.   We are forced to be more involved in each other’s lives here in Mexico.  There are not the distractions of home that pull everyone in a different direction.  A game of rummy-cube replaces TV, a day trip to the hot springs with the kids instead of golf for me, the entire family sitting and talking and watching the sunset together.  The elusive “quality time” is found here everyday.  Well now you know why I are an engineer and not a novelist.  That is all for now I’ll try to post again latter.  PS.. I cannot get my E-mail to work, I can receive them but it won’t let me send them.  I am off to the computer store today to see if it can be fixed.
