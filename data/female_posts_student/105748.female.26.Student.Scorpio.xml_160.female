Make it as memorabLe and happy for the two of you as possible. This day is for you two aLone, not anybodyeLse's! iVE been Lucky to coordinate weddings....thank God, none of mah screwed up friends's...but most of them have put the emphasis on making their guests and famiLy feeL comfortabLe and contented. To avoid troubLe, there's gotta be a Line drawn somewhere.
