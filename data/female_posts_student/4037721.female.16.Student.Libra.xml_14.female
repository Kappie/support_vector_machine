I went back onto the computer (something I should stay away from on holiday) that was in the reception for about 40 minuites! LMAO.      We went out to a resturant that specalised in Canarian and Italian food, and the meal was very good for a change, lmao. During the meal I joked about stuart having a boyfriend to get back at him for his repetetive "Charlie's a Lesbian" joke. Dad said, and I quote "If Stuart came home with a boyfriend I would kill him....Slowley" and then to return the favour Stuart asked "What about if Charlie had a girlfriend?". Suprizingly, but unfairly he said that, that would be ok with him. Stupid man. Why is it ok for girl on girl, but not guy on guy. Typical straigth male view. I used to think better of my Dad. Well at least I know that when I tell him he will be ok with it. Thats about it for today folks. Goodnight!
