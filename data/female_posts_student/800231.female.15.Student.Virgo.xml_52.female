I don't think I've been to a party like that since elementary school, no drinking or smoking and it ended at 8:00Pm, does that even meet the definition of party? Who knows... Highlight of the party was when Sasha turned to me and Lucia and yelled "Male chickens are called cocks!". I choked on my cake and couldn't stop laughing. For the rest of the night we couldn't stop making cock jokes. Ex" "Hey Alice, do you have any caulk?" "Cock?!" "You know, nice, white caulk..." "You're disgusting!"  Thursday was fun. Alice, Lucia, Vendy and I went to a water park and spent the entire day there. The ride over was fucking hilarious, Alice's mum drove us. At one point we were on the freeway and Alice's mum kept taking her hands off the wheel. Vendy turned around and screamed "Holy shit! She's driving with her knees!" Vendy just freaked out and I couldn't stop laughing. The park itself was pretty cool too. We went on a river ride thingy complete with innertubes. Alice and I were floating along and talking, Alice said something that struck me as completely fucking hilarious and I started laughing. Unfortunately I was laughing so hard that I fell off of my innertube, the "river" was only 3 ft deep so I just stood up and started laughing even harder. Then I noticed that all of this had transpired right next to a lifeguard and said lifeguard was looking at me like I was a complete fucktard. So I waved at him, he waved back and all of sudden I see Lucia float past. She starts laughing too and pretty soon we've managed to stop the entire ride. Good Lord.  Everything is funny when you're on a ride, seriously. Take these lovely quotes for example. Every last one made me laugh like me like an idiot. "Licky boom boom down!" "Auggh! I see wooden boobs!" "Go turkey." "Aww fuck, there goes my spleen..." "I'm going to my happy place... C'mon I-5, don't fail me now!" Goodnight! :)
