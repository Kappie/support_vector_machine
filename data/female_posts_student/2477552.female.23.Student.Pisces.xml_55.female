There's no snow on the ground to impede the two minute trip to the coin-op and alternatively there's no chance I can simply slide my heavy laundry basket over the ice and snow. However, I can use my new bag for laundry and let me tell you, I'm styling.   Nobody does there laundry at 8 am on a sunday. It's peaceful, meloncholy, to have my choice of twelve washers and dryers. Happy laundrying!
