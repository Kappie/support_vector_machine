That's what music is to me: good melody with actual lyrics. With some songs I didn't listen to the lyrics and now I do and I'm like 'geez dodgey!' or 'err freaky'. Some music has really good lyrics that make you think and wonder... wow. And other stuff has ...crap. (Is it me or are you saying the same thing different ways?) Yep! Better go.... eat frosties bubi!
