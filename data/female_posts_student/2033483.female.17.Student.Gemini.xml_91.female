I was watching that show today as I was making myself fish sticks and I wondered, if some guy went through the contents of my room would he 1) find it interesting and 2) find that it accurately reflects my personality.  Isn't it funny how the different things we own reflect our personalities?    Yesterday my mom and I went to the mall and she bought me my birthday presents.  Mostly Hollister contents with the exception of one piece from Abercrombie.    Today, I slept until 10 which is the lastest I've slept this summer vacation.  I really didn't do anything today.  We went to Calvers after church.  My dad didn't want to go home and since we had been talking about new cars for me over supper we decided to go look at some.  There were some really nice ones out there.  But I just can't ask my parents to buy me a new car...not now.  Their's so many other things they need.  Those things are more important then me riding in style.  I'm just gonna have to suck it up for another year I think.    I love you and good night, ~KAY
