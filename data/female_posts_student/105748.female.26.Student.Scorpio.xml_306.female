I ended up looking at a profoundly made site and was so curious that other Filipinos were as interested in Ska as was I.  I was known as VinzSka then and still now among certain circles but thats another story.  Ching invited me to her Beau Monde club and another group where we started telling this never ending story about a Cyborg and her Girlfriend.  Um er... or maybe thats another story yet again.  Anyway, Ching is Awesome as an internet friend. Altough we have never met face to face we have talked a great deal online and She and I have faced reality in our own sense.  Thank you for all those years, oh and I would also like to thank the ACADEMY... uh oh.. now Im just wasting time.  Okay theyre telling me to finish up...Okay thanks Mom!.   Peace out!    ~Net
