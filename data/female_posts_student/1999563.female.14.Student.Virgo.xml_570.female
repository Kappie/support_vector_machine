But I just hung out with Sara and Emily and Heather and Katie just kind of ingored us.  Emily, Sara, and I had SO much fun though!!  Hhaha.  Like swinging and stalking marc and eric.   It was so funny!!  The only empty spot during lunch was next to Marc and Eric so S+E+ME sat by them. Hahha. They looked kinda scared.  Then they were playing football and Sara was like "I wanna play!!" So we played football with them. Hahha  I'm gonna miss those two!  Then like when they were going home meagan and liz were like "Eric can I have a hug????" and he was like "Uh...." I felt sorry for the pooor fellow!   I want to write a really long post but I don't know what to say.  *shuting up now*
