When it comes to those I love, I like to think that I am a compassionate person when these people are in pain. However, my coworkers are something else. I have to work with these people, for crying out loud, and most of the time, I wish they would disappear. It is hard to strike the right balance between professionalism (i.e. not getting caught talking about personal issues during business hours) and friendly interest and concern (i.e. making people I don't really honestly care one whit about think that I am there for them in thick and thin). And since it is naturally in my nature to gossip, it is hard for me to keep things to myself. So I want to tell other people about my coworkers' sundry problems... and then I realize that no one else really cares. Which really bursts my bubble.  I feel for these women, don't get me wrong. But their problems pervaded MY work space today, making our entire department suffer, because people were down in the dumps all day, and that makes our boring job even tougher to take. You have to have a modicum positivity in there, or it's all sink and no swim.  I cannot relate to someone whose husband has left them. I CAN relate to someone who has lost a loved one, as I lost my beloved Pa-Paw almost ten years ago. But I can't talk to someone about their recently-deceased, because it reminds me of my own pain and has me in inconsolable tears for hours (I have yet to come to terms with my grandfather's death, but that's a tale for another day when I am not so tired or emotional).   In short, I am no good at dealing with other people's problems. I have enough of my own to worry about, and I have enough trouble trying to figure out how to solve those, let alone the problems of the world.  I need a beer.
