But this is funny. If you don't understand it read it anyway.  Tiny the tiger is now the centre of my world. Heck, my universe even. TINY THE TIGER ROCKS.  The female parent got me one of those cursed packs of various chips and stuff. You know, the ones that ALWAYS have some promotional toy thing? Well...yeah. Out of boredom, I took the toy out, and it HAPPENED to be TINY THE TIGER!!! -huggles Tiny- Umm...yeah. Since then I have been collecting Tiny stuff.  Anyway, this morning I was doing my nails. WOW I hear you say sarcastically. Yeah. So interesting. either way, so I was doing my nails. I just covered them with a transparent coat to make them all shiny and then painted the tips metallic blue. Its so cool, over half of my nails are now blue. Yeah, my nails are long. I dunno how I manage to type. Of course I have to take it off tomorrow for damn school but so waht.   Weather Options   It was SO fucking freezing this morning. Still is, actually. Really, God should let us choose what the weather will be every day.  So I was just sitting there still in my PJs doing my nails in the fucking freezing cold of the non-snowing Australian winter.   Harry Potter 3Harry Potter 3   That is NOt a typo. I have to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban twice in a row. First is on Saturday, in two weeks. Nicola's bday party. Bday movie rather. So I have to go then. And then with Tracey the day after, because Tracey can't go. And I thought I wouldn't be able to go so I offered to go with Tracey. Now I discover I CAN go but I'm still sdtuck going with Tracey and Dana the day after. And Dan's friend, Steph.   Intermission: Friend Bio   Nicola: Half-Chinese. In my opinion she smiles too much. She's happy too much. But wtf. She's my friend. :) -huggles huge group of friends-   The Tragedies of Drama(And being tall)   We have Drama first period tomorrow. We have to do a play. I didn't practise my lines and I have one of the main parts. I need to put my costume together tonite. I only found this out right now right after I had finished typing the Intermission. omigoshwhythefuckdidntanyonetellmebeforewewonthavetimetopractiseourlineswhatifsomeoneslatewhatiftheymakeusgofirstgghasntpractisedtheemotioninhermostimportantlinewhatiflottydoesntwanttodoitagain?  I need black pants. GG told me I could borrow her size 12 ones. I was like, size *12*??? I'm like size *16*. Note the difference there. And then I NEED BLACK SHOES. I dont have any. No one who has any is in my size. FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK. GG is the only person who I have the msn of. Shes a midget. FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKLFUCK. I am SO Doomed.   Now the tragedies of RPing   I'm doing this RP on Warriors Realm and this guy just DECIDED to make his character go out cold. This totally wrecks anything I could have been hoping to do(eg, fight finally?) and leaves me in a position where my character can't really do anything except be all 'girly.' She's only like part of a species that is totally warriorness, like. She's like me only I don't fight, I just draw blood. -drooling fangs-  Its totally ruined. Just when I managed to get the storyline going again he brings it to a total halt. Now I have no idea what to write. I am at a loss.   So go  urlLink HERE  and read it all. I am of course the lovely Mystik Drake. If you go to the second page you will see my amazing storyline-boost and his total storyline-kill.
