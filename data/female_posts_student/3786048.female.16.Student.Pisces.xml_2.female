I would introduce myself as sister to the groom[at the wedding], but what about his stepsisters from his Dad's remarriage? I guess I should be glad [mum and his dad] split up or I wouldn't be here. It's just hard to think that I barely know him and he has this whole other life that I know nothing about. I'm at least blood related, but what if whne mom dies he does the same thing Uncle Rob did? I hope not!" "...My mother was previously married to, wait, what's his name? I don't even remember. I think it's Craig. I don't know. I think he sent me my rollar skating troll on one of my Birthdays. I don't know why." I wont go into the other stuff about how amazing it is that I am here today and the workings of the female body for all you male readers. I'll protect your innocence for one day at least!  Have a fabulous day! Sweet Dreams! Ray-Ray
