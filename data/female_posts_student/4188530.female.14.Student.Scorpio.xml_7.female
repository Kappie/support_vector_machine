Well at least I got a ride from my friend, Nicole which I can't thank enough for giving Grace and I a ride. A part of me is saying Alina you know you're suppose to do your homework you know what. Then I just eat another cheetos. Gosh they're good. I went shopping for the remainder of my supplies needed for school. I hopefully got everything cause my mom sort of rushed me out of the house once I got home. While we were there I was pretty damn annoyed cause I forgot my list at home. I have a feeling that typing more will not help so I think I'll be off doing my homework. I'll more to type. Maybe.          Side note: I get to wake up at 5 in the morning oh joy.
