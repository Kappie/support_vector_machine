Went to watch 50 first dates today.. Enjoyed that movie totally, Its funny and yet leaves a fairy tale kind of sweetness.. Don't we all need a little fantasy in our mundane and monotonous existence?? Or is it only me and my exam moodswings that need that?=) Hahaz... Not gonna waste my brainjuice pondering over it...  There is a yakun kaya toast stall in Northpoint now! AH.... Bless kaya toast... I feel that Yakun is a great place for hanging out and catching up with friends.. Come on, how much do we have to spend in Starbucks? A glass of barley water only costs a $1.30 in Yakun, and the seats are not bad too, value for money. Call me uncool but I'll choose Yakun anytime over starbucks.. Well maybe one of the reasons is that I'm hyperallergic to caffine! I can never take too much coffee or I'll get edgy and hyper...  Lately, the clubbing streak in me seems to be surfacing.. I miss the days when I would go Lox with M.. Dancing to Rnb, checking out guys, being checked out by guys.. Ya all that... PARTY!  I just found out from my brother that 90's music is considered to be retro now. Songs like Horny, Tubthumping and Don't call me baby... God I'm getting old.. And I thought retro was something like electric dreams or summerain!  I'm thinking of going to Devils Bar since my bro told me wednesday is ladies night.. Though the music is not that fantastic, I heard its pretty decent too.. And the place is nicely done up with a good atmosphere..  Ah.. Ok got to wake up.. HAve to strive for exams n projects.. Till then...  Toil now, play later la!
