Okay, a few near misses, but at least I'm still in one piece (except for the blisters on my ankles!). I really enjoyed myself, haven't had a good bit of fun in a long time! It proibably won't be that lo ng before I go back, Nancy reckons I'm taking her next weekend, ha ha! No. Maybe later in the summer. Anyway, thanks to max for organising it, and thanks to everyone else for making it such an enjoyable day!  Tomorrow is the Europe centre, which will probably be as boring as hell. Providing that I can actually walk to get there, lol. But you don't know, miracles may happen! Anyway, see ya later guys, I'm off to get some beans on toast!
