But we got there and did bumper bowling..I somehow completely suck lol got a couple strikes though. Will won the first game and I won the second...oh and Will fell on his face lol I felt bad but I called it cause he was bowling all funny lol. After that we went back to his house and just hung out, then Clint and I went to dairy queen for food and I dropped him off and I went to McDonald's..what a dinner. Thing's are getting a lot better between me and Clint which is really good but apparently not so well for Jessie and Allen. During school it was always me and Clint having the issues and so close to breaking up and now during the summer when everything should just be chill and fun..they fight all the time and actually did break up. For once I'm seriously not looking foward to school, usualy I get bored of summer and wanna see my friends but seems like Junior years gonna be a bitch and my friends are gonna be gone..still no Carlye, Jessie and Allen broke up, Zacks gonna be going to Pioneer and then Bean...well no one knows about bean..NICE CAR JACKASS! lol OH my license finally came in the mail...funny pic lemme tell ya. I'm sure I'll be pulled over enough for all the cops to stop and look at, and then of course laugh. Still no partying...at all. Straight edge..go me lol. Well gonna finish gettin ready hopefully see Clint along with Savannah today (no matter what you say Clint she's a cutie) so later on
