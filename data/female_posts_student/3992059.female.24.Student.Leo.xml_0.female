I guess it's just to be able to say that I have one.      Anyway.  What's going on?  My birthday is next week and we have no money.  I have school to pay for, so that is going to be the extent of my birthday this year.  What fun eh?  Sometimes I wish we didn't buy a house until I was through school.  But I know that if we didn't buy one when we did, then we wouldn't be in the place we are now.  I love this house.  I really do.  Sometimes I feel like it's not clean enough and that it's too small, but I really do love this place.  And I think it's best that we have the place we do because of the girls.  They can go play in the "field" as we call it and we don't have to worry about them.      I wish their birthdays were during the summer.  Then we'd be able to have the parties at the park or outside in the yard.  With having winter birthdays there's less options for them for parties.  I know that's not a huge deal, but it is to SD6.  SD7 gets parties at her mom's house every year because she's the 'miracle child.'  But SD6....she's told me before that she only gets to go out to dinner with her mom and godmother.  So last year we had birthday parties and invited my parents, my grandfather, my sister and BIL and my nephews.  We also invited his parents and little brother, but like normal they cancelled on us.  I think this year I might look into the jumpin jungle in town and see if we can invite some of SD6's classmates.  I can't transport them though, so I'm going to assume that most of them wouldn't show up.  The other option is for her to choose a couple friends to spend the night in our living room.  DH isn't up for this idea.  he doesn't want to do anything like that because our house isn't ready for entertaining anyone.  Well guess what.  She's going to be 7.  That's a critical age for friendships and that's the age that they start spending the night at friends houses having sleepovers and whatnot.  I don't want to hold her back on being able to have a friend come to daddy's house.  I want her friends to know the difference between the two houses.  At mom's house, she beats mom up and argues with her day and night.  At dad's house, she respects dad and her stepmom and gets her butt chewed out if she even tries to hurt us.      Sometimes I just don't know what to do.    Jessica
