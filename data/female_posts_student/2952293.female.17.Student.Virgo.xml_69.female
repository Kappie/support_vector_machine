A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to the mother on the phone. Once we set up a couple of dates, she says, "Now, I don't want you to get scared or anything, I mean we are really normal, don't worry, it's fine, but we have a 19 year old girl living in our attic. Now, she can't be trusted with the children, but she'll probably just stay in her room and listen to music, so don't worry." WHAT?! Okay, so last Satruday, she wasn't there. But yesterday... we meet the girl in the attic. I was playing outside with the kids (by the way they are super obnoxious!) and we come inside, and I see this person on the couch. I say hi and then rush the kids upstairs to take their baths. When we came down, she was gone. Then I put the kids to bed and went downstairs. About five minutes later  I hear, "Did I sleep?" I DON'T KNOW! So I said I thought she had and she comes over. Girl has got some dreds. White girl with dreds. Now, you have to understand, this family lives in a huge house in Bexley and their two kids go to Columbus Academy. They have like an Audi, BMW, and a minivan. They're rich. And their cousin is very opposite of this family. That's fine, it was just well... let me go on. She asks me if I'm in school, and I tell her that I'm still in high school and go to CSG. Then we talk about boys and single-sex education, etc. She wanted to look at my books. I had all my English texts we need for the exam, so I show them all to her. She had never heard of  Beloved ,  The Feminine Mystique , or  The Great Gatsby . Okay, how can you be in college, even if you dropped out, and NOT know those books?! Then she goes, "Yeah I dropped out of school" and then she asks me where I want to go to college, and I tell her that I want to be in NYC, and she used to work there. Then we start talking about how Columbus doesn't exactly have the night life scene as NYC. I don't know how, but somehow we start talking about drugs. I go on saying, "Well, yeah there are a lot of parties in Bexley with drugs and drinking. You can find it" and then she asks if other people are involved and I said, "Well, I mean it's not like every single Bexley boy is growing weed in their back yard, so yeah they can get it from someone else. Plus, this is the eastside, there's marijuana growing everywhere!" Then she was like making me explain to her how to get to the eastside, aka she wants drugs. I don't know, then she asked me if I knew any 18 or 19 year olds, which I don't. Then she gets up to leave and says, "Don't do drugs HAHAHAHAHA!" AHH I WAS SO SCARED! When I was leaving their house, I saw all these kids getting out of their cars and going into some house. I was like PARTY! I literally almost pulled over my car and went in. I mean, I was wearing an old t-shirt, velour pants, and these pink, orange, and yellow flowered flip-flops, I was lookin hot, so I really almost crashed the par-tay! But then I was too tired and went home.  I babysat this morning. Aiden came in. I asked him how he was doing and he said, "Fine, well I've been bad for the past two years. And my allergies are taking over" WHAT KID SAYS THAT?! He's really funny. I think that's about it. BYE!
