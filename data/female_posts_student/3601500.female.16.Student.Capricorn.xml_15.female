Sounds risky, and my friend made me realize it - I'm such a risk-taker, I'd have gone back to Ottawa with the guy to his apartment (yes, we know each-other from the web). He was ready to come and get me - to watch a movie and talk, mind you. :P  (Luckily though, on the pretense that I have no sense of direction and so couldn't tell him how to get here, I refused. And erm, it's actually true.) I told him I'd ask my mom to drive me there so it's safer (and I might), and Neko was relieved. I heart Neko.  I was just reading some FMA fanfic on FF.net since it had 40 reviews (the most after my sister's G story) so I figured it had to be better than the other (lousy) fanfics. It wasn't bad, but I commented on the girl's writing flaws and proposed my services as a beta. And guess what, looks like I'll have even less time to waste. ^-^;;  And I've been listening to ''Gessekai'' most of the time (by Buck Tick, from the Nightwaler Soundtrack (I like that anime - vampiiiies!)). It's a song I just can't get tired to hear! Just... sexy voice... lyrics... don't make sense... seksy voice... *droolls* ^.^  ...I definitely need to get some stuff done, instead of just reading webcomics (what I did a lot this week-end). I currently read: Sublunary Saturnalia Avalon Venus Envy Lean On Me For the Love Of Yaoi Your Wings Are Mine Nihilism Legends of Rovana Okashina Okashi Mega Tokyo Penny Arcade Neko The Kitty Carrots and Cheese Red Moon White Whiskers ...and I'll edit that list as I think of the others. Man, major cramps. *dies*
