(Someone should really check my English skills) And I do look like a marshmellow in my white jumper! Not that that's got anything to do with it... Err, yup, I'm weird when I'm happy! (Happy all the time makes weird people!) Especially if you laugh a lot, apparantly that's the secret to old age, so I'm goona be immortal muhahahaaa! Makes kind of a nice change from 'screw the world' mood aye? Woohoo!!!
