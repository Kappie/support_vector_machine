(Yay, atl.) They are pretty controversial because they are frank and not at all PC, but still muy funny. And if people would only a) understand sarcasm and b) use moderation, there'd be no problem at all. For the record, there is no "Don Miller," and they explained that a long time ago. They made up a random name for humor.  Now, last week a great controversy erupted because some guy on the show commented that he found it annoying when people on bicycles rode in the middle of the street at slow paces and wouldn't allow cars to pass them. Some "cyclist" took this the wrong way and suddenly all the cycling nubs of Atlanta were on the show's case, writing these great letters about how people were always persecuting them, comparing their plight to that of blacks, and threatening all kinds of crap.   Normally, I really enjoy stuff like that because honestly, there are a lot of idiots in Atlanta and you couldn't make that kind of comedy up if you tried. But this morning, they read a letter from a pissy conservative who brought in a whole bunch of trite things about Bushie-wushie. And this guy actually wrote a letter to the FCC about how 99X was spewing "liberal Anti-American propaganda."  You see, it's all fine and good to support Bush, because i know, love, and respect plenty of people who do. It's your fucking right. I'm okay with that. It's America.  But it just downright PISSES ME OFF when people claim that NOT supporting him is "anti-American." That somehow, THEY have the right to support their own beliefs, but IIII do not. Like, it's only patriotic to agree with the government.  Uh, yeah, in Cuba.  I hate very much that such a small percentage of Republicans I know are actually reasonable when it comes to politics. How, when you look at the nation, it's not really that many that are unreasonable anyway. How a percentage of IDIOTS ruin their whole thing, and say shit in the name of their party.  BUT i hate even more that they get away with it.  So, in a small bout of retaliation, I am going to deconstruct this idiot's letter. I don't know where to start on his beliefs, so we'll just hold our noses high as we observe his shitty grammar. My comments are   BOLD.   Enjoy.   OFFENSIVE MATERIAL ON WNNX   Good day gentleman.  I think he's writing to more than one guy, and needs a comma after his introductory phrase.   Of course, you may not have good days much longer, thanks to your lack of respect for our President and the FCC.  That syntax is just gross. If I agreed, i might rephrase it for him.  Just so you know what was said, I've attached the message I sent to the FCC last Friday about your show. I guy work with said Jimmy claimed to make $300K a year.  Nice grammar, buddy.  That's great, because it will only take him a few years to pay off his portion of the fine. You other two might have a little more trouble.  I tuned this morning  oh, he must be a musician  just long enough to hear that you're having America hater  should be hyphenated  Bill Marr on your show tomorrow. The same Bill Marr who said the 9/11 terrorists were heroes and we are the cowards.  Nice fragment.  Unless you want another complaint to the FCC, I suggest you either cancel the interview, or at least do everything in your power to make him understand how wrong he is. I will be monitoring your show tomorrow to make sure your don't allow any more indecent material on the air.  In your sick twisted minds,  commas, anyone?  you probably think what you did was alright and that I'm a jerk. Well if you had kids your attitude would be totally different.  commas after introduction and subjunctive.   -Josh  ANyone else like how he started off formally and ended with a dash?   Honorable Chairman Powell,  Suck up more, please. Oh, wait, that's not grammar. Oh well - he's still being dumb.    I am sending you this email in regard to inform you  WHAT? What are you, retarded? What kind of affected and grammatically incorrect phrase is that?  that some very offensive material was aired over public radio in Atlanta recently. On Thursday May 6  welcome to writing dates correctly  at about 9:00 AM, the "Don Miller Morning Show" on WNNX 99.7 FM allowed an anti-American, liberal so-called comedian named David Cross to come on their show and talk at length about how the current war for Iraqi freedom is bad, and how our esteemed commander-in-chief, George W. Bush, is terrible.  "Big word big word big word big word.... uhh... bad."   The Don Miller Morning show allowed this David Cross character  sounds like an old West sheriff  several minutes to spew liberal anti-American lies and propaganda.  I love the diction of vomit here - it's so creative! "spewing propaganda" - whoever heard of such a great use of imagery and metaphor? Bravo!  They did not try to counter his arguments or shut him down. Many of the cast members even vocally agreed with several of his "points".  punctuation inside the quotes  He cast dispersions on our President,  Does anyone else know what the hell he means by "casting dispersions?" ... maybe he thought the big word would scare us.   questioned his intelligence, and even had the gall  oooh.... brain cramp  to question our  whose? are YOU part of the war?  motivations for the war for Iraqi freedom. All of this was said over public airwaves and could be heard by impressionable children. I think everyone agrees that freedom of speech is important, but their are limits, especially when children could be given the wrong idea about our leaders and our country.  Well, that's debateable, but I think we can all agree that children should never be allowed to think freely.   In addition, while corresponding with the Don Miller Morning Show by email over this matter, I was called several unmentionable names and my intelligence was derided.  Again... does anyone know what "deriding intelligence" is?  One of the members of the show, "Jimmy Baron",   comma inside the quotes  who has admitted on air to being Jewish,  admitted? What, is it embarrassing? even took the name of Jesus in vain.  Well, God forbid a BUSINESS should allow other religious beliefs!   According to their website, the members of the Don Miller Morning show are: Fred "Toucher" (the head), Jimmy Baron, Wally (last name unknown), Leslie Framm, "Crash" and "Calandro" .  punctuation inside the quotes!  For your record, their is no "Don Miller".  first of all, learn to spell "there." and for God's sake, PUT THE F*CKING PUNCTUATION MARKS INSIDE THE QUOTATION MARKS!  I have only had correspondence with the first three on this list, and I can only assume that most or even all of the show members are using fake "show-biz" names.  Thank for the attention I know you will give this matter,  thank WHO?  and thank you for the fine job you are doing in cleaning up America's airwaves.  Your Fellow Patriot, Josh   Sucking up.... and if he thinks Colin Powell is as stupid as him, he should be shot to prevent his genes from tainting the rest of humanity.     He also misspelled Leslie Fram's name, and he probably doesn't even know what "FCC" stands for, as he neglected to use its full name of this government institution in "formal" letters.  Moral of the story - don't write rude letters unless you write them WELL.  (taken from  urlLink the 99x website. )
