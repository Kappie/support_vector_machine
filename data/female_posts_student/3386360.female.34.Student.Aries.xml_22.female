She attempted to tell the other family members but my other sister and oldest brother said they could not go becuase they were still grieving for my nephew and my other brother can't make it becuase his children have an important function that he needs to take them to and it would all be to inconvenant yet they wanted her there for my nephew's funeral, ohhing and ahhing over how important she was and how glad they were she was back in their lives and how they would always be there for her and yet when her husband dies no one can be there for her. She said she understands why I cant and I am the only one who has a "pass" in her heart not to be there. HOw the hell can they do this ? They are all within a 2 hour radius of her and they can not go for stupid reasons. Yes my other sister's son died and she is grieving I understand that but her grieve is no less then my other sisters now. The fact my one brother wont go due to a function of his children why the heck cant his wife do it ? Is there something so important that he can not be there for his sister ? I've made up my mind. I intend to go to California when I am able (when A.C. comes back I will ask him) I intend to see my family and to tell them to F*ck off and die except my one sister. She is the only one who has even extended her hand to me and even though at times it is hard to deal with she is the one I know I can talk to. I can honestly say now that I am glad my mother is dead and doesnt have to bare witness in human form to this humiliation that my family is behaving. I am embarrassed and ashamed of my family except my oldest sister.
