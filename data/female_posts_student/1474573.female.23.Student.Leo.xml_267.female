Damn scavengers.  The only bird I like, and that's dead, is the chicken.  Because if you've ever been around a live chicken, they're not that nice... although their underbellies are really soft.  I know this because I used to take care of them in camp and we'd have to collect the eggs.  But I digress, this is not about the love of chicken, but about the dislike of almost all things birdy.  I've had a few incidents to help me assess my opinion and I will share them now...  Pigeons and poop issues... 1. A pigeon pooped on my hair while walking across the park one day with a cute boy.  It was very embarrassing.  2. A pigeon pooped on my friend's shirt, on the boobage area (which is rather large) on the way to school and she had to go through the whole day of school with a nasty stain on her shirt.  3. A pigeon pooped on my my little neighbor Jeannie's ice cream while she was about to lick it.    Seagulls and food... 1. My high school was very close to the Bronx resevoir where a bunch of Seagulls hung out.  They would constantly vulturize your food.  All watching you while you ate your lunch an' shit.  Hmmph.   2. While on vacation in San Diego, I decided to go to Sea World.  While there I bought a Churro.  Y'know, those yummy long donutty things?  About 5 to 10 feet from the food stand, while looking at the sea lions, a seagull came out of nowhere and snatched my churro out of my hands.  It scared the shit outta me.  3. While in Wildwood, NJ on a weekend getaway, Steve goes to the bathroom and has me watch his corndog.  I was sitting at a table.  I turned my back for no longer than a second, literally, and its gone.  Gone to the vultures.  Sorry, honey.  Other random birds and our back yard... 1. I see some pretty birds but the moment I see them eating the grass seeds, I hate them all. I want to be reimbursed by them.    2. The damn birds are all happy and chirpy at like, 5am...  What the hell is their problem??  3. There is just too many of them.  Damn woods!  Oh! But I will exclude ducks from my 'I hate birds' diatribe because I believe them to be cute.  Actually, I only like duck butts.  I know it sounds perverted, but I mean it like, a duck is in the water and then he dunks down to eat something like a fish, and their little behinds go up while their back feet paddle to keep them down?  You know,  that ?  Its hilarious!  I could watch a duck butt all day long.    I also adore geese (but not Canadian Geese, they suck) because of the movie Babe.  Yes, Babe is a pig, but Ferdinand, his friend is a neurotic goose who tries to be useful around the barn so that the farmers don't eat him.  He's very funny and therefore I cannot hate geese either.
