Joe Trippi is back blogging at his site,    urlLink   http://www.joetrippi.com/     , though he hasn't updated  urlLink his personal blog  for a couple of weeks.      I laughed, I cried and I probably twitched a bit, too, watching the raw, behind the scenes look at the Dean campaign CNN aired this past winter. Actually, it was one of the best pieces of journalism I've  ever  witnessed.  I remember Joe downing lots of Diet Coke.      Well, there on his site is a bit about OpenCola. Open source food. I like it! I can't get opencola.org to come up (probably getting major hits right now), but I think, after reading the English translation of the  urlLink Japanese OpenCola  write-up, I prefer anyway:          Making soft drinks is not for the faint of heart, nor the dirty of finger. It is a solemn enterprise not to be entered into lightly, as with marriage or buying used farm machinery...   No one's putting a gun to your head, so don't bother if you can't boil water. Improper use of cola might result in blunt trauma, puncture wounds, physical illness, mental illness, caffeine dependency, dental necrosis, acid reflux, death, devastation, and random tax audits.        Actually, I think openCOLA is a search engine company that fell into some financial trouble.
