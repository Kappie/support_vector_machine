She is like my little sister, so when I see her putting on tight pants or doing her makeup I wanna cry and help her and tell her not to do it all at the same time. But I dont, and i just hold it back and smile at her. She is getting so beautiful. And the guys know it... they better be good to her. I leave for Florida in 3 days! I cant wait to get away. I need the vacation. I wish I didnt have a dentist appointment tomorrow, because I want to go and see my friends at church. But Im going thursday and then we are going to Whitewater. I have alot of self esteem now. Like, all of a suuden I dont care what people think of how I look or if they dont like me. I like who I am and the people who love me like who I am and I have decided that all of that is enough. God made me this way for a reason, and God dont make no junk. *lol... i saw that on a little kids shirt today* So yeah... i'm going to wear my new bathing suit from Old Navy and my new shorts from Old Navy to VBS and then change into cheerleading shorts @ Whitewater. Yupp, thats the plan.
