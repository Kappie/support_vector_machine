Instead, she put something like technology lab for 2nd period instead. Interesting. Anyway, she gave me Belcher, then I asked for Lamb, and she said ok. Then she changed it back to Belcher though, after asking Mr. Diskin, meaning that all the other people she changed will probably go back to Belcher as well. I told her that Belcher doesn't want to teach spanish 5 ap and he told me so, and she got all angry about it and talked to Holmes, but I had already previously talked to him. Anyway, I'm stuck with this schedule: 0 TOK crisci 1 SPANISH 5 AP belcher 2 THEATRE STUDIES karr 3 ENGLISH 4 IB underberger 4  COMPUTER SCIENCE A AP tufenkjian 5 IB MATH HL hildreth I hate it.
