I know a man and our story would have been beautiful. Full of fires and friends and cuddles, and a gang of young cats out to take on the world. We would have made love in the morning before school, and he would have brought me a bowl of Vector in his pjs. My stories are frequently would haves. I have had our relationship in my head, and why couldn't he see how much fun we were having? I miss him and I've never kissed him.Truth.We will see each other when you come. I'm awaiting your arrival. The door is unlocked.
