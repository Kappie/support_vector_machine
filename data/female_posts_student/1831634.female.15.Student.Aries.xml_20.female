I walked in and I heard whispers of, "who's that?  is she a relative?  where are her parents?" and kerry's parents/anyone else who knew me going, "oh, no, she's just a neighbor."  then I heard whispers of, "wow, she's so tall!"  "her hair's so long!"  "why isn't she skinny like the rest of america?" (okay maybe not the last one but still...)  anyhow. went upstairs.  knit.  watched spirited away.  again.  in response to me taking out my knitting needles and starting to knit: Kerry's cousins: YOU KNIT?! kerry: you're a TEENAGER that knits? kerry's cousin: dude, you're an uberdork! kerry: but but but... people don't knit until they're like... 80! me: -__-;; I like knitting.  during the movie: me: I wonder if I can knit without looking. kerry: that's just what I was about to ask. me: yay!  I can do it! kerry's cousin: UBERUBERdork.  later: me: oo, I wonder how far around my neck this will go. ::tries it on:: kerry's cousin (david...?  I think): dude, if you don't knit until you're 80, then you don't actually wear what you knit until you're at least 100. me: thank you.  right.  then after the movie, everyone migrated in a big mass to kerry's room because it has swords.  oh, and there was this REALLY annoying little sevvie there... no one knew who she was, but we all assumed she was one of kerry's cousins.  (even kerry didn't know everyone at his house... it was kinda freaky.)  she's the type of person who thinks that she knows absolutely everything in the world.  for example: we were in a room.  A LOT of ppl were in a room. her: wow, it's hot in here.  I'm getting claustrophobic. ::leaves:: ::mass snickering:: ::comes back in:: kerry: I thought you were claustrophobic...? her: gosh, you guys are so gully-i-ble.  (that's how she pronounces it... I swear) kerry: oh, yeah, so perhaps you should leave. her: *counts ppl in room*  oh, there's only 6 ppl in here.  i'm not claustrophobic w/6 ppl. ::someone else comes in:: her: okay, I'm claustrophobic now. ::leaves:: kerry: so what does she do when she goes to school?  walk in a classroom, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, oh, no, mrs. teacher, there's too many ppl in here.  I can't learn. everyone: *laff*  god.  she is SO annoying.  kerry was making fun of the word "sevvie"... "what do you mean, sevvie?  it sounds like you've severed your arm or something.  oh, look, I don't have an arm!  I'm a sevvie!"  anyhow.  back to the mass migration to kerry's room...  we went in.  played w/swords.  then kerry was waving around his little three-section staff stick swingy thingy, and he hit the lightbulb.  and it shattered.  like... shattered. everywhere.  everyone got high in his room b/c of the gas inside the light bulb.  yeah.  and so I was on my knees helping him pick up the glass shards... and I cut my hand.  like... really really cut my hand.  I was bleeding everywhere.  the glass cut in a triangular shape, too, so I just had this flap of skin hanging out and blood was gushing EVERYWHERE.  so then I ran like heck into his bathroom... where I bled all over his sink and towels.  it was... strange.  so I was cupping my hand with my other hand, and kerry comes into the bathroom (which was crowded beyond imagination... it's amazing the morbid interest little kids have in blood...) with this bottle of STUFF... and he wants to pour it over my wound.  And I was going, "get that thing AWAY from me!" and he goes, "No.  It doesn't hurt a bit!  See?  It says right here... 'NO HURT'." I reply, "Dude.  Those things LIE." "Dude.  If you don't let me pour this over you, your hand's gonna get infected and it's gonna fall off.  Do you want to walk around school w/ppl making fun of your fallen-off hand?" "NO." "See?  Let me pour this stuff over you." All this time I've been trying to get my hand out of his reach... which was how I got blood all over his stuff.  right.  so after a lot of running away from him and hiding and stuff (which didn't really work really well... as it was his house...), I finally agreed to let him pour that stuff over me (and it really didn't hurt.... darnit).  yeah.  and now I can't feel my fingers cuz I've lost so much blood.  I told him that, and he got me this warm little pouch thing, and I told him that I couldn't feel the warm.  then he felt my fingers and got freaked.  yeah.  and so now my wound feels REALLY REALLY warm and I can't feel my fingers.  and my wound is all purple and brown and there's all this dried blood around it... and it's throbbing like heck.  and I think I cut right on a vein b/c it's standing out really really clearly.  and I can't get blood to my fingers.  yes. anyhow.  that's my little adventure of the day.  my hand really hurts now.  IT REALLY HURTS.  yeah.  oh, what do you think of the new blog?  ++sunny
