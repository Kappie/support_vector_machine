It was good.  And watched a movie and just hung around, I found myself to be enjoying something and considering the state my mind has been in lately it was such a good feeling I am only sad it's over.  Ah well everything has to end at some point.    I have so much shit to do tomorrow though.  That makes me worried, I am sitting here worrying about tomorrow.  Holy shit. I'm just tired.  It's not that late, 1:30...but I am usually in bed sleeping soundly by now but I just got home.  I need to go wash my face and go to sleep...I am having trouble holding my head up right now...  zZzZzZzZz
