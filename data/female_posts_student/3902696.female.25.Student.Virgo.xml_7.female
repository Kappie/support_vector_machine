Why do I wake up this way so much? ..I try to analyze. All my thoughts, worries and fears come out in my dreams, almost every night. What do "normal" people dream? I've had bad dreams ever since I was a teenager, but lately I've realized that they say a lotabout me. I think that my dreams do the greiving and crying out that I don't do when I'm awake. When I'm awake I feel the pain in my heart all day long, almost to a point of numbness. Sometimes I think it's gone becauseI'm used to itor because I get distracted from it. But its not gone, its hangs from my neck like a heavy burdening chain. During the day I don't know what to do with the pain. I think over and over again, "What do you do with a lifetime of pain?" "How do you make it better?" "What can I possibly do besides dysfunctional things (drinking, other addictions etc) that actually relieves the pain?" With all the counseling I've been to, no one has even gotten close to helping me find a solution to that problem.  Sometimes I feel like I do not sleep well because my dreams are always bothering me. I wake up desperately wanting to cry, but I can't. What an awful feeling?! Do you ever need to and want to cry, but you physically can't? For some reason I rarely can cry by myself. I wish I could lock myself away and just cry and cry until I felt better, but I can't. The only thing I do is get mad alone.I can the only thing I can do, is dream.  I don't want to hurt anymore, I don't. I want all this to end. I want to find a solution, I want this to be over with... but it follows me everywhere I go. It haunts me in my dreams, it weights itself on my body during the day, it seems as though nothing I do makes it better. I don't want to wallow, I want it gone. It is a dilemma for me. Maybe the dreams will make it better, maybe the dreams can do the greiving that I am unable to do awake, and then someday I will connect with my unconscious and we can grieve together.
