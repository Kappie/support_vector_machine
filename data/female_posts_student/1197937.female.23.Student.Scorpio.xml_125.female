Today:   Regret is something that none of us are willing to admit, because doing so would be futile and regressive. thankfully for the defense mechanisms encoded into our system, we manage to forget and move on, or at least convince ourselves that we have.  because i can't cry for myself, my mom cried for me instead. there have only been two things in my life that's made me cry big droplets of hurt like that. i do everything possible to make sure that i won't be vulnerable to those feelings again. i've become such a master at aloofness that i deceive even myself. i'm great at getting misty-eyed over sad movies and moving books, but when it comes to the big personal stuff, things that really matter...nothing, no feeling at all. unfortunately, the people who love me aren't as well-protected. i'm so sorry.  if you don't care enough about yourself, at least think of those who do...all actions have consequences. please remember this. please be responsible for yourself, for your mind and your body.
