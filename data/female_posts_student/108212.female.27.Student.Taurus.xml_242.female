You look beautiful in those gowns, Ching! I wish I could attend cuz I have known you for years. I feel like I know you even though we haven't met in person. But, alas, I have to save what little scratch I have for when I move. :(    I want to see Beautiful Mind. I heard it's a cross between Shine and Good Will Hunting. What do you think?    I promised you a reading list. I don't know if you're in the mood to read novels, but that's what I've been reading lately so these are what come to mind:   Some Girls  by Kristin McCloy   Like Being Killed  by Ellen Miller   The Price of Salt  by Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan   Indigo  by Graham Joyce   Po Man's Child  by Marci Blackman
