Yeah and apperently we needed a stereo because my family was coming over for xmas eve. Ok so now i have to tell everyone what has happened for the past week. Alright on tuesday (xmas eve) my family came over and that's just not even worth going into detail about. But i did get 10 things i hate about you, which is always a plus. Then christmas we opened more presents and i got lotr on dvd WOOT and i got a cook book from the oh-so-sexy, oh-so-talented, oh-so-british Jamie Oliver. WOOT again. Then tursday i went to see two towers (again) with heather laurel and madeline. Madeline had cut her own hair so after the movie we like ambushed her trying to get her hair down. Everyone was staring at us like "omg why are they gang raping her" but its nice to know that no matter how loud you scream people won't come to help you, only point and say "wow what losers." Yeah so while we were trying to get madeline's hair down and we're all like yelling and shit this guy like 50 feet away goes "yo are you talking to me" and we're like "does it look like we're talking to you, you stupid egomaniac!" Anyway, on friday pretty much nothing happened, my parents friends came over and brought their kids. They brought dvds with them, how sad is that they have to be constantly watching tv. Anyway so we watched star wars 2. mmm ewan mcgreggor. Everyone loved Hayden Christenson (sp?) in that movie but i disagree its all about ewan. Then saturday my uncle and aunt came down, that was cool-ish. Then on sunday anna came over, and then we went to see two towers (her 2nd time, my 3rd). Yup thats pretty much all that happened. woot. bubye.
