I'm also breaking out into pimples on my face. Red ones. Ick. They're so gross.  I think it's 'cuz of my lack of a sleep schedule, they say that sleep deprivation causes break out.  They also say that depression/stress can do it to. Well I'm not really stressed.   But I've been feeling really shitty as of late, so who knows.   *sigh*  I just want to go back to bed, but I look on the brightside. There's a really awesome sale at the Bon-Ton today, and I'm going during lunch, lol. That might make me feel better, I need new shoes anyhow.   In other news, 4 days yay!!!!!  I think I miss him a lot, and that that's why I feel so crappy. I'm used to seeing him and talking to him.   Meh, I need acne stuff.   I hate people. You can all go fuck off now >:O
