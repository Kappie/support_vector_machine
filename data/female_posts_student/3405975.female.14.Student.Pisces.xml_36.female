It'd be kooL to be able to fight using a wooden sword... Able to show off to others that you know fight skills...But that is not the principle of kendo. HIazz....  Anyway, I'M GONNA SAY IT RIGHT NOW. I'm not gonna be submissive... (Where did that come from?? *looks around* ) I hate people who are submissive, but I read in a book that "What you dislike in others, you will find them in yourselves too". -.- Is that true?? Haha, so if I hate submissive people I'm submissive too?! >.  Doing IPW now...SOmewhat, we are slacking... Haha, I'm a stupid, ignorant, lazy, good-for-nothing leader...And you guys just luv me! THANK YOU THANK YOU!! =D Anyway, that's it I guess...for now. GOnna see if I can update when I'm home...*charges forward* IPPPWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  -Ast-  - BEing able to fly is great. Being able to have freedom is better- Being able to have you by my side at night whenever I get cold and you are there to warm me is the best off all-
