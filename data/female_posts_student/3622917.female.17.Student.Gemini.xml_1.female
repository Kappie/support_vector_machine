I have made a new blog because people were asking me about the other one but some of the stuff I have written in there is a little personal. So yeah I dunno. But here I am! I'm listening to Death Cab for Cutie's Transatlanticism. This CD is so beautiful and pretty. It's also really sad. Really sad. =( But it is a good sad. Cause there is such thing. At least as far as I know there is.  My brother has cut his hair. It is um, well it's interesting anyway. It is Davey Havok's hair from AFI from four years ago. I told him that he should have waited a little longer so that he could have had retro hair. I mean, retro! He didn't take too kindly to that and I know have some lovely red marks on my arms to show for it. Thanks a lot jerk boy! Actually got to talk to people online last night which was nice. Normally I am asleep by the time that anyone fun is one. Excluding Diana who is on more often than that. Yay Diana!!! So I got to have sorta human contact. I guess it is more computer contact but I don't care. It is just like talking to people only I don't have to talk. Which is good because I have decided that I don't like my voice. I may just take a vow of silence. Hahahaha, how long do you think that would last? Less than an hour even if I was home alone and the phone was off. Yeah, I don't need people around to talk. Shhh... I need to get to writing people some email... Sorry Erin! I was supposed to do this yesterday, and normally I would have but a lot of other stuff came up yesterday. So that has become my action plan for the day. Write emails and watch movies and do nothing. By the way, thank you Kirsti!!! For the awesome movie selection. Started Ferris Bueller's Day Off yesterday ("When Cameron was in Egypt's land... Let my Cameron go.") and Finding Nemo today. Fun fun fun! Well that is all for now. Sorry bout the short post but it is almost lunch and I am hungry. More later...
