At quizno's, we debated if "farm" could be a verb or a noun.  We also said lots of really funny stuff, all of which were so funny that i can't remember about half of it.  Then they came over to my house and we watched Blind Date shows, Degrassi and Radio Free Roscoe.  Then we sat up in my room until 2 am, acting really drunk though we had had no alcohol and we ate a few hangover drops, mint balls, muffins with drinking coke at the same time.  Jess fell off the bed randomly which was really really funny.  Tons of fun, all around.  Today i haven't really done much of anything, i'll probably just watch hockey like i always do.  Dallas plays Vancouver tonight at 8pm.....i'll probably be at someone elses house for the game like britts or jess' but i dunno for sure yet.  Marty Turco is suspended so i hope we'll make it through.    Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
