I am thinking of this song now, while  urlLink Jimmy Eat World's  " urlLink A Sunday " is playing on repeat. (whew, I have to say that this thought maybe a bit disjointed because it took for-fucking-ever to hyperlink those suckers.  I tried to find lyric pages that didn't have a shitload of pop-ups, but the web is just flooded with them it is really fucking annoying and yes, I have a pop-up blocker).  Anyway.  So I am listening to one of the most depressing songs ever.  And trust me I know depressing songs. And I am thinking back to my sophomore year of high school, listening to "judas song" in my basement and staring at my oversized poster of depeche mode and being sad and alone like your typical nerdy teenager.  And yet, that is actually how I feel right now. Sad and Alone.  the only difference between now and then is that back then I didn't long to smoke in bed and drink tequilla.    Life would be simpler if I didn't obsess over the most absurd details of my mundane existence.  Life would be simpler if I could forget about Mr. David.  Life would be simpler if I could learn to live alone, if I could be happy practicing guitar five hours a day and reading and drinking alone.  And probably even simpler if I left out the drinking part.  But would it be better?   urlLink The Descent of the Dove .  It's a book a priest loaned me once.  It discusses the two paths to god.  Negative: Abstaining from the physicality of the world so as not to be distracted by it.  Positive: Embracing the physical and finding God in all its aspects.  Williams makes no distinction between either method, both are equally valuable in theory.  But in practice one should not because more concerned about the path than about the destination.  Like anything abstention can lead to fanatical deprivation and involvement can lead to overindulgence.      None of this is anything new or interesting, I know.  But it seems somehow relevant to my life right now.  I don't think I can abstain from depression, but I certainly don't have to revel in it.  Which is what I am doing.  I know that I am bruising my soul, perhaps scarring it even.  But I can't seem to stop myself.    The haze clears from your eyes on a sunday.  on a sunday. What you wish for won't come true. Live with that.  Well, I don't want to live with that.  I want things to go my fucking way, god damnit! I think I am having an electric temper tantrum.  Fuck you MR. David.  Despite all my craziness, which, honestly, happens out of your site, I am really fucking cool.  I am smart (despite the lack of eloquence in these posts) and I am funny (actually funny, not just poop-humor funny) and I am compassionate and caring, but not nice and boring, and I am fucking good at fucking and I am loyal and trust worthy. I think outside the fucking box and don't  rebel just be to a non-conformists like all the other non-conformists.  God damn it david. What the fuck is your problem?  Do you think some 20 year-old  girl  is going to fly across the country to live with you in that shitty little new england town we go to school in?  Do you think she is going to follow you around for years while you pursue your career?  Or do you really think the two of you can manage a 3000 mile long distance relationship for the next four-seven years while she gets her PH.D. (because honestly, what else is a history major supposed to do?)  Yeah, fucking right.  She'll dump you before she turns 22.  Trust me.  It's nothing against her.  She's just young. That's all.  And that's what girls do.     Yeah, yeah, I know I am only 23. But fuck. you're twenty-fucking-six.  There's six years between the two of you and only three between you and me.  And we are both in grad school together and there was a reason you dumped her in the first place? REMEMBER?! she was too young and she couldn't commit.  Do you think six months will change that? Well it won't.   You should call me, you piece of shit.  You should call me and fall for me and make everything okay again.    What you wish for won't come true.    Fuck. I hate it when I sound like this.  Fucking Trite! That's what all of this is.  I have a clear recollection of walking down the street in my hometown.  I was 16, I was hanging out with a friend of mine, a 15 year-old boy.  He started ranting about something or other and I started thinking:  Everything he says has been said before, and in a more eloquent and powerful way.  He sounds just like every other pissed off, isolated and angst-filled teen.  And then I thought: My God! I must sound like that too.   Well damnit.  It sucks to be going through all this emotional melodramatic shit and not even be able to talk about it in an interesting/beautiful/powerful/moving way.  I am so fucking jealous of all of those assholes who can just pick up the guitar and pound out an emotionally driven song, or those fuckers who can just pick up a pen and compose a poem or easy.  Yeah, yeah, I know. You have to  practice  , you have to keep reading, writing, editing.  But let's face it.  Effort only gets you so far without talent.   Okay. Well  that  was attractive, wasn't it?  Sigh.  At least it's better to do it here so I can more easily maintain my facade of calm cool collected detachment.  Okay. no more ranting. time to smoke.
