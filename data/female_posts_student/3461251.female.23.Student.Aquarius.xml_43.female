It's funny how it comes on the radio while I'm sitting here thinking about what to do with the whole friendship but the truth is, whether it feels like he used me or whatever... I really do miss the old us.    I miss our pointless conversations about anything.  I miss him being able to make me giggle or laugh when I'm feeling my lowest or just in a icky mood.  I miss the fact he can make me blush, just by saying how good I look or whatever.  I miss the fact I thought I could trust him, no matter what. I miss all that but on the other hand I don't like the way I feel right now! I can't shake the feeling of being used but yet I want too because I know he cares about me...  I also hate the fact I hear information about Josh from Shay, rather then Josh telling me - I hate that so much!  It makes me feel like I'm not important, which may be true.  I mean hell he's going Georgia for a week.  But it makes me wonder if he would of ever told me if it wasn't for Shay bragging about.  Blah.  I wish I knew what to do!  I wish this wasn't so hard to deal with!  I wish we never sleep together if this is how it was going to end!  Gosh, how I wish this could be all different but thing is - I'm not sure what I want out of the whole deal now.    I wonder if I'm making this a bigger deal then it should be.  I wonder if he thinks I'm just being a bitch about it? - Maybe it be best to just forget about what happened and just think of him as some online friend, rather then someone I've sleep with and got feelings for.......
