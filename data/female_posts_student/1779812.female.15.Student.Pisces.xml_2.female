     
      					 Sometimes   			Sometimes life is full of honey, 				Always sweet and never changing.  			Sometimes life is full of oranges, 				Sweet and sour, never knowing what you'll get.  			Sometimes life has ups and downs, 				But if you take it with a smile, 			Then you can be sure that life is just a whole load of fun!
