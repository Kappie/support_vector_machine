It's 2:33 am, and I really shouldn't be up anymore, but I'm not sleepy, so thing. :P ~~~~~ Let's travel back in time. n_n;; Last tuesday I went to Galleria with Gela to meet up with Racine and Camilla, and this guy and his friends from their interaction. We ended up getting there late, but Racine was the last to come. n_n;; We ate at Pizza Hut and decided to roam around until the guys got there. They didn't until around 3-4 pm, which was bad because we had been there since around 12. During that span of time we basically went everywhere in Galle. Then, as we were going up the stairs to go to Starbucks, I saw him. 0_o The guy I had (note: had) a crush on at the interaction. He was with two of my other classmates. Damn, it really caught me off guard! There I was, hoping to meet a nice guy, when out of the blue, I meet the guy I gave up on. He wasn't supposed to be there!! n_n;; Seriously though, it pissed me off. What pissed me off more was the fact that sooo many other guys at Galle looked like him. > ~~~~~ Christmas Eve! Actually, it's already Christmas here. :P I got a portable sewing machine from my auntie! O_o And right now, I'm trying to translate this H doujin.. (Don't ask why. n_n;;)How do I do this?!?! x_x Heeelp!  But overall, this Christmas is way much better than last year's. :P
