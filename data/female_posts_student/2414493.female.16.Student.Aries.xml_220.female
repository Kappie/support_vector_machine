I did 100 pages in Cliff's, except page 100 was blank. Well, I've met my quota for today, though I believe my knowledge of meiosis and mitosis and respiration are still spotty. But hey, that's all right. 100 pages a day, and then some time left over for review. I tell myself that if I really truly want to do well on this bio AP I might as well apply myself.   So now it's 10pm and I still haven't done math homework. I vaguely remember something about matrices, Andrew brought up nonlinear equations last night and I didn't know what he was talking about. Sorry for snapping, Andrew.  We got a lot of English homework today. Arr.  I listened to Jack Johnson today. Again. I kind of got sick of the Postal Service, maybe. I still can't find Jimmy Eat World. Oh well.   Not bad, don't you think?
