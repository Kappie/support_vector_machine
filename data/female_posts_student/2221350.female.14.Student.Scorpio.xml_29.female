I don't know why I'm blogging since at this point of the day I am half asleep and won't awaken fully until I go to tennis class to play target practice I mean volleyball... That weird guy who looks like shane is always lurking around the gym, or maybe he's just transferred to tennis and I don't know it?  Woke up with a nirvana song in my head and decided to dress grunge today, which I pulled off rather well... My mom told me I look like a homeless person, doesn't she know that's the magnet style ?  What is this obsession with china hot? It's this tiny Chinese food place on a corner in a crappy part of town((but Shreveport is ONE BIG crappy part of town so I guess that was a little null)) every single day someone mentions it to me and I tell them I haven't eaten there and they explode. It's weird...  Won't torture you with dumb rambles about Chinese food anymore. ::torture torture:: ::poke poke:: ::laugh::
