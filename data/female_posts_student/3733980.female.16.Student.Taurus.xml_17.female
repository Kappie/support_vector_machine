You see, she and her brother have disagreements a lot and a certain one ws angering her so much that she screamed at him on her livejournal without any sort of  gentleness  or  reverence , certainly not  urlLink seasoned with salt .   Then God spoke to her and she turned around her angry away. What a blessing, hey, hey, hey. Um. Yeah. But aside from that, yesterday was the fourth of July so that meant many things for Caroline...  She woke up and went to  urlLink church.  And in church she was surprised to find us singing "God Bless America" when she does not personally like the song because it sounds like feeble humans trying to command the LORD, the God Almighty to bless America, when He is All-powerful and can do whatever He wants. But at the same time, she figured, it is one of the most religious patriotic songs which she knows of and the church did not want to be unpatriotic, so there ya go.  Then she came home and did her devotional and then went to a big Fourth of July bash at a big country house in Forney w/ her parent's  Adult Bible Fellowship . That was LOADS of fun. Food, prayer, volleyball, basketball (my favorite part), and other stuff. Though I felt a little awkward and lonely there at times, the LORD blessed me with an over-all good time. As the evening went on it got better.  Then I came home and went to bed. I didn't have too much trouble sleeping at all, thank God. And I slept in. Had some breakfast and since I'm starving again, I'm having a little more. That's about it. Any  urlLink questions ? ^_^
