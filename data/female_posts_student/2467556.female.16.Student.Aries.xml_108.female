It sucked because we lost 3-1, but the entire Coppell Hockey team was there so i spied on them most of the game after the stars were down 2-1.  It was fun, lol.  How did i find them? During the intermission i was looking for the lady that throws the nextel/ups shirts things so i could maybe catch one and then i saw TJ Drinkwater practically falling out of his seat trying to get one.  of course, he's the easiest to find because he's soo much drastically taller than everyone else, and then i quickly realized that the entire team was there.  I was in the section above them, lol.  Oh yeah, the game was crap because the ref sucked MAJOR.  I probably said ALOT of things i shouldn't have said and that probably made me look very un-ladylike.....but screw it, i was at a hockey game.  I pulled bets with the guys behind me on how bad the stars were going to lose that night and won 20 bucks.  That was awesome!  They were laughing at me the entire game for spying on the team, so i decided to use my "psychic abilties" and make them lose money lol.    In other news, Coppell plays Jesuit in what will be possibly the most important game of the season at 7pm in Valley Ranch.  This will be the final showdown between these 2 teams and will ultimately decide who will make it to section championships and who will go to state.  Jesuit's record this season is 14-7-3 while Coppell's record is 19-3-2.  Coppell currently has no players suspended while Jesuit has one, Clayton Collie, who has been suspended since March 18th.  haha, i sounded like a sportscaster just then.  I know my boys will kick ass like they always do, but i know this'll be a hard game for them and they better play well and play hard.  I expect all the jesuit people will turn out for this game as well as the coppell people!  It'll be an awesome game and you don't want to miss it!  They better show that they're regional champs and don't let anyone forget it!  Total Sleep Hours this week - 12 hrs  Today i had renaissance and i went to Local Diner again and had cheese fries, they were good.  Last night, i visited my fave graduated student in the entire world....Victor!!! He works at Kelly's and we caught up for a little bit.  He still hasn't started college and he swears that by the time i come back to visit him, he'll have started classes.  I swear, he better or i'm so going to hurt him.  Also on Wednesday, my official waiter at Boston's, Kenny, and i caught up also.  I visited with him and he's in college doing well.....i also found out he had a girlfriend! he never told me that! He asked me if i was jealous and i was like yes Kenny, i'm jealous of your girlfriend.  lol, good times.    Everyone listen to the song "Come On" by Ben Jelen........its soooooo awesome  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
