It was just amazing. Ok here's a quote... "candy corn. What's that about? It's corn... that tastes like candy. I remember the first time my mom gave me candy corn. 'here lewis. It's corn, but it tastes like candy.' I can remember thinking. Hey that sounds great. So I eat it. And I'm like 'THIS IS CRAP!' but every holloween since then I have eaten candy corn. It's like I get alzheimer's (sp?). Every year I see a bowl of candy corn sitting on the table and I think 'Hmm... corn that tastes like candy.' *eats* 'SON OF A BITCH'" see what did i tell you. GENIUS.
