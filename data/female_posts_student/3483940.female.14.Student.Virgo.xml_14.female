People should get on with life and forget about what happened many years ago, a month ago, a week ago, and a few days ago. But sometimes the past is attached to you. All you can think about is the past. It’s hard to get over. So many things you don’t want on your mind just sit and stay's there. And it’s so annoying. It makes you want to scream. Makes you want to do anything to forget the pain of the past, or the future that may come. Being unhappy for a long time then suddenly not being unhappy would be a great relaxing feeling. But of course there is the past to deal with. The thoughts that buzz around your head. But sometimes you have no one tell those thoughts and your feelings too. And if you do, the person you’re telling do not understand, they think your crazy and should just move on with it all. Well its times like those you should just freak out at them. Yell harshly at them. For they do not understand what your going through.  	 It's odd the way life works. I don’t think a person would fully understand it. There is always something or someone blocking the way. Or something and someone are blocking you from moving on. For example family issues, friends, or just random things.   	Trust is a major thing. A thing that you should truly consider who you can or can't trust. Trust is a complicated thing to deal with. Trusting someone all your life and then finding out in odds scatterd way is hard to deal with. I am still trying to get over it. Or trusting a friend with a secret can sometimes be difficult. But you have the people you know you can trust and always will, and that’s all the matters, and if something happens it’s brutal, but in a way you know you can trust that person with some things. In my opinion trust is very important and there is more to it then one realizes.   Hannah
