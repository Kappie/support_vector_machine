Usually tuesdays are really fun because we do a lab for most of the morning, then we go out to lunch or "in to the world" as sarah calls it, and then we play volleyball in the afternoon. It was stormy out yesterday, so there was no volleyball, but it was still a good day. I worked a lot on the list of images for Dr. Baum. She taught me an easier way to use the Space Telescope Data Archives search, so it is going alot faster now and i am almost done. The lab we did yesterday was pretty cool. The directions were a little confusing, but my results were pretty accurate. I still wish there was a way to put the screens and objects in stands though, rather than just holding them in an approximate location. We went to DiBellas for lunch which was really good. I can't believe I had never been there. I am definitly going back sometime.
