It was a beautiful example of how we create schemas as a way to organize people. There were a lot of kids there that I didn't know, so I was asking one of my favorite girls who they were and if they went to our church (because I need to know the kids who go to our church, because I'm leading their bible study next year).  So, I looked down the table and saw one of the girls who was in my cabin at camp. I know that this girl has a boyfriend, and there was a boy sitting next to her, so I asked my informant if that boy was so and so's boyfriend, and she gave me a funny look. She said "no!!! her boyfriend kisses girls and almost has sex!!!!! That guy has never even held hands with a girl!!! Geez, Nora!!!!!!" And as some backup information about my informant, she has never had a boyfriend, which she is very proud of, and has also probably never done any of the things that she thought this other girls boyfriend had done.   It was interesting to me that she chose "sexual experience" as a schema in which to classify these people- it must be something that she thinks about. It was definitely clear that she grouped this boy within her own ingroup, and the experienced boy outside. It also gave me insight into the way that she thinks about these groups- I think that she put some judgement on the experienced boy. It also gave me insight into what she thinks about- she obviously must think about her own level of experience often, if it is a means by which she classifies others. I wonder if she groups girls in this same way, or just boys.
