I straightened me hair. Then I just kinda sat around til lunch. We had mac n cheese, and hotdogs. Then I got online for a while...no one was on so i got off...i went and watched a movie with my cousins..and then came to chat with cookie and kelsey. Cookie has a big secret that shes keeping from me and its driving me crazy NOT knowing what it is. Around 4:30 i got off to get ready for soccer. I went got my stuff on, and then i went to eat, i had pasta. its abotu 5:30 by now. Then we took Eric and Faye to there practice, I had to sit through that. Then around 7:00 we went to mine. I was a little late, but they hadn't really started yet. We started our normal touches, passing, running, stretching, weave, yadda yadda yadda, and then we started scrimmaging, we played 3v4..my team had 3 people...that was interesting....and then we played possesion, and some other stuff. and by now its like 8:30..we start stretching and then im outta there. Practice was really boring for me, i didnt have any of my real good buddies there (kelsey or becca) then we came home, showered, i had a malt, and then i got online again. Whad i tell yah, pretty blan, huh?
