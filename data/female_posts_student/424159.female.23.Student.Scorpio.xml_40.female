I'm hoping Thursday will be eventful.  I'm going home, but my mom's not cooking dinner this year.  This ought to be interesting.  Especially if Dad cooks.  Hopefully I'll be able to pass out soon here.  I have to work in the morning.  Maybe I'll take some NyQuil for this cold thats starting to creep up on me.    Talk to you later.
