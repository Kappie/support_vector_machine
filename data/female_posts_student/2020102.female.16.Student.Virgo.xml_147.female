When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and    sap is in the bough; When light is on the wild-wood stream, and    wind is on the brow; When stride is long, and breath is deep, and    keen the mountain air, Come back to me! Come back to me, and    say my land is fair.   Entwife.  When Spring is come to garth and field,     and corn is in the blade; When blossom like a shining snow is on the     orchard laid; When shower and Sun upon the Earth with     fragrance filled the air, I'll linger here, and will not come, because    my land is fair.   Ent.  When Summer lies upon the world, and in a     noon of gold, Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the    dreams of trees unfold; When woodland halls are green and cool,    and wind is in the West, Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best.    Entwife.  When Summer warms the hanging fruit and    burns the berry brown; When straw is gold, and ear is white, and    harvest comes to town; When honey spills, and apple swells, though    wind be in the West, I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my     land is best!   Ent.  When Winter comes, the winter wild that    hill and wood shall slay; When trees shall fall and starless night de-    vour the sunless day; When wind is in the deadly East, then in    the bitter rain I'll look for thee, and all to theel; I'll come to thee again!   Entwife.  When Winter comes, and singing ends,     when darkness falls at last; When broken is the barren boguh, and light    and labour past; I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we    meet again: Together we will take the road beneath the    bitter rain!   Both.  Together we will take the road that leads    into the West. And far away will find a land where both    our hearts may rest.   -Tolkien,  The Two Towers
