As I was watching it intently, I decided, in an inspired stroke of genius, to push the spot and poke it a bit, in the vague hope it would miraculously disappear. Instead, I successfully ripped off a large chunk of the ceiling, scattering pieces of plaster over the bathroom floor and into my eye. After shouting loudly that my eye was burning and I had lost my sight, I noticed noone was paying any attention to me and subsided. I continued to stare at the spot, that was now more of a dent, wondering what I should do about it.   I decided to talk to my cat, who was sitting next to me, licking his nether regions, about it. After explaining the situation to him, I awaited his reply. He stared at me. I stared at him. He continued to lick himself. I glanced back up and squinted my eyes in an attempt to give the impression I was reflecting upon a deep philosophical issue. Then, in a second stroke of genius, I stupidly decided to poke it again, and once more got covered in plaster. The dent that was once a spot, had turned into an almost gaping hole of darkness and brown inner-ceiling material. Fascinated, I peered at it, trying to uncover the mysteries of ceiling material, and went on my merry way some seconds later, as I have the attention span of a candy bar wrapper.   The next morning, I urgently needed to relieve myself, as is common for earth-bound creatures to do. As I was sitting there, staring in front of me with my usual toilet expression; mouth open and eyes glazed over, humming a tune from Mary Poppins, I heard my neighbours above me flush their toilet, and snickered a bit at this odd coincidence. It was then I felt a cold liquid run over my back. I jumped up with a loud howl, and looked up. The gaping hole I created was leaking! I don't even want to know with what, but I guess I'll have to deal with this nuisance somewhere in the near future, like when I move out and let my roommate know about it.
