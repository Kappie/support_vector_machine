But i really feel better after crying out. =0) Hmm... dun noe wat to do with her, i think tat maybe i should not tolerate her temper/attitude from the starting. I am also a human, sometimes when i just keep quiet, i am just control myself as i noe tat u are like tat!!! Anyway i am feeling ok after i went out with my CLIQUE members! Today is the princess birthday and i totally forget it. Really but i dun mean it, lucky bel reminded me. Hehee... But i will give you your belated birthday present (Big princess). Haha... we went bowling and i was a idot making a fool out of myself infront of so many pple. I didnt noe how to bowl so i jus throw the ball and it goes like" Bombb... go straight to the drain". Hehee... after playing i eat the jap noodles, it is ok lah, and i waste $3.30 on a Eeee... drink. Hehee... saw juli, sharon ng, samantha and tiffany at cinni. Now i am going to have my shower as i sink like   Shit  !
