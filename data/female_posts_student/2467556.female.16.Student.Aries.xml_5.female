Today i got Christmas presents from Chuan and Isaac.  Thanks guys!!!  Chuan gave me a decked out in christmas attire teddy bear!!! Its sooo cute!  And Isaac gave me a shower gift basket that has all this really good smelling body spray and lotion etc.  Its awesome.  Guess what? No Stars hockey for approximatley 3 days now that the christmas hockey break is coming.  grrr.....now what am i going to do to entertain myself?  oh well, its all good.  i discovered that my daddy is getting me the NHL Center Ice package thingie for Christmas for sure now!!!  Brittany- that means we get to watch the Dallas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, AND New Jersey games!!!!  It going to be awesome.  So if the Stars are losing....i'll just change the channel and watch a different team.  I win!  Meh, thats all for today! Countdown List: *1 day (basically) until Christmas *3 days until Brittany comes back from Boston *1 day (basically) until i get to watch my Pirates of the Carribbean DVD *1 day until i get to watch every freaking game in the NHL with Brittany (when she comes back) with my NHL center ice package  Merry Christmas,   ~~~Taylor~~~
