Fuck, his name might as well have been Joe Normal the Office Worker.   He was  another horny guy in a long line of horny guys sitting around a greasy bar top. He used one fist and a dollar bill as good excuse to touch a 19 year-old sweaty thigh while the other moved under his pants, knuckles rubbing raw against cheap polyester.   Still, there was something different about him, hidden as it may have been to others. I noticed it right away, having seen hundreds of leering faces from between my knees, their noses almost touching my G-string, their faces a sickening display of male weakness.  Hell, Oprah says strip bars exploit women. She should come out sometime... two minutes in the place and any idiot can see the MEN are the ones being exploited.   Anyway, to get back to what I was saying; Mr. Joe Normal wasn't leering or poking his nose in places it didn't belong and his eyes weren't the glazed over pre-cum-lit eyes of the other customers.   His eyes were desperate, lonely... remembering and wishing all at once, and he had a dreamy smile on his face. His eyes spoke to me and, though they startled me at first, (Hell, a girl gets USED to leers in a place like this!) I chose him without a second thought.  I sent Tiny with a wad of money and an offer Joe Normal, the Adventure Seeker wouldn't refuse.  Tiny looked like the stereotypical bouncer. No neck, some muscle but mostly fat, and so friggin' BIG that he had to have an un original nick name filled with irony.   Tiny was my spokesperson because he had a soft voice and spoke intelligently. He was also good at filtering the guys I chose, just in case I'd made a bad decision.   Once Joe Normal got the point that Tiny was for real, he took the job willingly enough.  "Sure I'll take her out. I'll even wine her and dine her first if the money's right."  He tried to sound tough, but it was obvious he was excited. And the money WAS right. It spilled from his pockets like a fountain leaving a slug-like trail of green from bar to bar for the rest of that night.  It was his last night of freedom, and I figured he should enjoy it while he could.
