I'll be home sunday around 1:00ish.  Sorry if you miss my pretty posts around here for the next three days, but I promise (or is it a threat?), I will be back.  And I want to see some major postage on this blog by more than just Josh, cause he'll get lonely since no one gives decent replies around here anymore (I do understand the rushed post, though, will.  We all do it sometimes.)   Anyway, so I'll miss yall, or those I see and/or talk to regularly, I guess is more acurate.  But even those I don't, I will be thinking about you.  By the way, Rosie, where do we get in contact with you via phone?  I'm not so good about e-mailing right now.    Ok, so I took a Trazadone and have more energy now than I did at 3:00 this afternoon.  That's kind of sad.  So I should probably go now.  I've got to pack dvds and such for the LONG trip tomorrow.  Call me and keep me sane, please!!!    I'll see you/post sunday.
