I played the bigger person, I sacrificed my own integrity for someone else (who I love) so that he could be with someone he loved...but I didn't do it without changing my life so that I could finally be free of the chains that lies and deception have shackled to me. Geez, yes, I love him, but all of this pain is unacceptable. I need to move on with my life, and he chose to hurt me so much to the point where I couldn't forgive it now, and I may never be able to forgive it, who knows. It's all so raw right now, it's hard to say. I am liberated, though, because he turned out to be someone I didn't know after all, and my heart is broken but I realize that this is the way things must be and I must hurt in order to heal. I have surprised myself with my own strength. I am this pillar that I never knew I could be...there is someone inside of me who only comes out when she is really hurt, and just knows how to pick me up and carry on until I'm ready to stand on my own two feet. Like, my strength and unselfishness truly has amazed me. I think I'm a jealous person by nature...not a devious one, a jealous one, but I became the reasonable ex-girlfriend today, I became the martyr when I sacrificed myself for someone else who wanted me only to do that to save something he had with another girl. That "he" is someone I happen to be in love with, who I thought was "the one." Wow, I don't think I'm the best person on earth right now or anything nutso like that, but I am surprised at my capabilities. I am surprised I could ignore his sobbing when I told him I was through with him and all of this. I have no desire to respond to his desperation e-mail because he's right, I do want to put this (and him) all behind me. Honestly. This time, I'm not fooling myself, I mean it. I meant everything I said, everything. I told him he made me sick, and I told him I was all out of tears, and at that moment, I was. I didn't cry talking to the girl, I didn't cry talking to him...who I am? Who have I become? I don't know the strength of this girl who is capable of choosing herself first in a time of crisis. I know that I won't stand by and watch him break me as slowly as he can. I have already been broken, and I won't be broken again. Wow. I can't believe all of this is the truth, that it's all what I mean with all of my heart. But I do. I'm changing. I am growing. I am me again.
