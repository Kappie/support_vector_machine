"oh crystal i cant believe he cheated on me im so stupid to think i was in love" "no shit you were stupid! did you really think you would make love and then he would want to marry you and yall would live happy ever after!?! yeah well life just dosent happen that way" and the classic "omg i really like him but how do i tell him/her? does he/she like me? is he/she to good for me?" "damn is it really that comlicated just go fuckin ask? stop obbsessing"  you stupid people should all do me a favor next time you have a crush, next time you think your i love (the 50th time this year) next time they brake your heart, next time they cheat, dont tell me, dont come running to me for advice! yeah come to me when your dad hits you, or when you get raped,  you start getting obsessed with drugs, you start drinking every night, when you think your pregnant, or when you end up in the hospital, call for my help and sympathy then and only then!  haha the funy thing is i have such this strong feeling, but i could never acutally tell my friends this! its just a feeling granted it is stupid shit and i dont really care i need to be there for my freinds! hey like they say what is done now will come back to repay you! now if its a good or bad pay back that up to us!         suppose to go to astroworld agian today but decided to go tommorow instead, my sister-in-law said we should just start living there we go so much! well that about all for today! i cleaned the house swept the front walk way cleaned the door swept the front hall and got no reconition as usuall! it sucks but nothin seems to change in this house!
