And there is no freedom of thought without doubt.”  ~Bergen Evans The Natural History of Nonsense    I wrote a blog a few days ago ranting and raving about the evils of the  urlLink Center for Bio-Ethical Reform  .  Now I feel that I should explain myself a bit more on that matter.  While I believe it is truly repulsive to see such images on the sides of trucks in restaurant parking lots, I believe its both in bad taste and give Republicans and Christians a bad name.  These things are true, but not the only problem I have with such images.  America is a country where anyone can say anything and get away with it, freedom of speech its called and I love this right as much as the next guy, but I think there should be a point where we draw the line.    Let me explain; in this country we rate movies G-R and even NC-17 or X.  These ratings keep children from viewing content that would be inappropriate for their age.  We also have people who read books and decide weather they are inappropriate for school libraries and good books get banned because someone didn’t like them.  What a shame then that literature is restricted to children and so are movies, but content on billboards and the side of trucks are not.  How is it different for a child to see an R rated movie where people are being killed and seeing the side of a truck with a HUGE aborted fetus upon it?  In my eyes there is not difference at all.    So why is it that these little things slip through with the right to scream “Freedom of Speech” and works of literature don’t?  Has this little thing slipped through our legislation?  Who gave these people the right to show such grotesque images in public for all eyes to see?  I can’t help feeling like they are preaching to the choir so to speak.  People who oppose abortion already believe that its wrong with out having to see it splayed out all over town, and people who believe in abortion are not going to be moved to a change in disposition or belief just by seeing something so grotesque.    In the end, when all is said and done, there will still be the trucks with the large pictures of death, there will still be protesters and billboards with images that are unfit for the public eye.  Simply put, someone with a bad attitude had something to say.  ~Kristyn
