While i was dancing...i tried to fight back tears but when i got deidra up and we put our arms over eachother and walked off i just busted out crying. I felt awful all day. Everyone i saw..i just kept thinking'this could be the last time i see this person for a long time' and i mean...i was just...omg it was bad. I felt bad about Francesca too...i shoulda told her sooner. But...we're good now..listend to Rooney on the bus. Im just gonna miss everyone..its been a good year with friends. All of us have really grown up.(not pervertedly)franny said 'i hate signing yearbooks,its so final'...i agree. Everythings so sudden i mean..im moving saturday and Francesca's moving the saturday after mine. I just feel so sad. *tear*...i hope someone calls me cuz i feel like talking. :(
