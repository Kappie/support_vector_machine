I believe that we should be thankful for being able to talk about shallow things, instead of having to worry about sickness, or money, or food, or where we're going to sleep tonight.  But I also think that we should take advantage of the brain God gave us to use.  I heard a saying the other day.  It went something like "Small minds talk about people, Average minds talk about events, Intelligent minds talk about ideas."  Why are we focusing so much on the intricate details of this argument?  You're either friends, unconditionally (meaning you take the good with the bad), or you're not friends.  If you're friends, you should forgive each other and let that all be in the past, and then forget about it.  If you're not, it shouldn't matter what the other person thinks of you, and so you should, let's see...forget about it.  I mean, there's a choice there, but my opinion is that yall at least take a break from each other.  I think yall are spending so much time together that the bad stuff is far outwaying the good.  And there is lots of good in both of you.  But maybe yall just need to step away from each other for a bit, even if it is just to gain some perspective.  What I think I'm trying to say is that this has gone on long enough, and both of yall need to make a decision, stick to it, and then forget about it.  Well, not forget about it exactly, just don't bring up the issue.  And even if yall don't like each other or whatever, at least respect each other.  Ok, that was my diplomatic answer.  As I started writing this, my true feelings came out.  Above is what I thought I felt.  Below is what I really feel.    Disclaimer: The following are my true thoughts and feelings.  If you are easily offended, do not read this.  I can't help what I'm feeling.  None of you were there 9 or 10 years ago when all this was starting up.  None of you were there in 5th grade or in middle school when basically what is happening now was happening.  Do not yell at me for saying what I think, however, feel free to debate what I am saying with facts based upon experience.  Or feel free to support me.  Or just leave the whole issue alone.  Whatever.    If what rosie saying is true, and it probably is, the rest of us may very well take the same stance you are.  I've been thinking about that.  I mean, do we really want to be Becca's "fat friends."  I've known Becca a long time, and this just sounds like something she's say.  I think she might just hold herself in higher regard than the rest of the world.  It's just that I've been thinking latel about the past 9 years that we've known each other, and it always seems like the only time she wants to be friends is when she needs me to do or be something for her... I'm not trying to turn people against becca or anything, but I've known Becca to lie.  A lot.  And though I've known Rosie a shorter amount of time, she's always been really trustworthy.  And I especially back her on this one because I know how it is with Becca.  I've been through version of this fight many times before.  As I was writing this, I was kind of neutral on this thing but now I am getting more and more...I don't know, not upset really, just kind of...perturbed..  Anyway, though I probably shouldn't take sides, I really am.  I am siding with Rosie, and my full support is behind her.  It's not that I like her more than Becca (though right now I really do, but that's not the point) it's that she is right on a lot on things.  And I'm not advocating that anyone else take sides either because I don't want this little "group" thing to end, but I do think that this is one thing Rosie really is right on.  I don't know about you guys, but I don't want a friend who is going to ditch me at the first sign of popularity.  I don't want a friend who is always telling me I'm second best.  That's not a friend.  Josh says that friendship is unconditional, and I agree with that to a degree. But once a person starts acting like this, though, I don't think that person is your friend any longer.  Then they are just an acquatince, a classmate.  And if what Rosie says is true, and I believe it is, then Becca has just become a classmate.  And unconditional no longer applies.
