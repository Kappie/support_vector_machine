I know I also left without really letting anyone know. I have realized though that you must make up with the people that you hurt. So I hope Jackie stays in contact with Ian and her sister before it is to late.I guess I will have to start posting more and more on this website now. It is just going to be Ian and I for a while until Abby gets the chance to start posting.
