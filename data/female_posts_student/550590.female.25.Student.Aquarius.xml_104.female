I was just a little preoccupied at the time of last writing, and clearly the priority in that entry lay a little lower.  We had lunch today and just finished talking on the phone for almost 2 hours.  I think even Kimmie would approve of this one...and Rebecca.  (Tomorrow he's bringing me a CD of traditional Jewish music.)  I definitely have a lot to contemplate now, and a lot to process as I make the laborious drive home yet again this weekend.  Stay tuned for what will hopefully be some intriguing and exciting journal entries in the future.  D
