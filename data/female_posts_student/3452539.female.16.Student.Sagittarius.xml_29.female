Precalculus - Panaccione went off on a tangent about having dreams the whole class.  Study - made more applications for Aces High  Spanish - listened to a presentation bu group 1. Slept through most of it actually.  Chemistry - couple of worksheets with Rils. Pretty basic.  History - wrote a letter with Rils in Miss Sjodin's defense and slept through Hitler movie.   WDhen I got home I took a shower and came into my room for an hour long nap in the sunshine. It was nice, and much needed. Woke up to a call from friends to hang out earlier in the evening.  I walked down to Dunkin Donuts and got a strawberry colatta (spelling?) then we left for the Holyoke mall. I ended up buyig a new DKM CD and belly button ring. Fun stuff. They bought the William Hung CD which also had a DVD so we listened to it all the way back to their house and then watched the DVD. William Hung is actually a pretty mean dude. It was funny. We plan to bring it to Battlecry.   ::sigh:: Battlecry...  As I was getting dropped off I was finally struck with the best part of my day every day. A call from Tycho. :-D I'm so glad that we got to talk. I miss you!!!  Also, I do not know if I should take offense to this or not:  Slickknick2001:  wat kind collage u want to get in Jaenen6:  Law/Business college Jaenen6:  Western New England Slickknick2001:  oh great u make a great lawyer  lol  Well, SATs bright and early tomorrow. Heads up for the longest weekend for me EVER. Not only do I have to wait for it to be over, I probably can't talk to Tycho. I hope he enjoys himself immensely and that I will be able to hear fun stories later on.   Enjo everything you do!   -J9
