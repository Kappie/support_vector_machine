And though I am very busy, I want to try to write at least 4 days a week if not more. Considering how much I'm on e-mail that won't be very hard.  Today I went to Gus swim team at 9:30 and taught the little swimmers till 10:30 then went and swam with the team from 10:30 to 11:15. I was planning on going to Rivi swim team this afternoon but we're not having it, due to the fact that most of the team just got back from an Ohio meet. I am going to work at 5 though. I work in the Rivi locker-room from 5-8, Monday through Saturday. It's not the most exciting job, basically I sit there and make sure people who are 21 don't go in the 21 and over showers and mop at the end. So I get to sit there, read and listen to music.  So that's about all I've done today and all I'm going to write, Later, Ellie
