Tmrw college reopens...so its back to the black hole called JC..kena sucked back in..mass lectures....mass PE...Mass everything awaits...how joyful...i'd be getting bek my papers tmrw... i guess my GP paper wldnt look so bad but the rest....i aint too optimistic..well whats done is done...all i can do is loook to the future...[looks bleak now..]  by the way, dont wonder why i deleted my old blog..just a split second decision....i'd keep changing the skin of it as and when i feel like...so dont be alarmed to see my posts missing or my blog in a teruk condition..it just means that the blog came under my never ending quest for perfection and learning...meddling with the codes is interesting you know...you shd try mess things up and then make em ok again...releases stress. and you learn sth new in the process.."WHILE I LIVE, I LEARN" well....what can i say....the pjc motto just inspires me!   hahahahahahahahah  its been very long since i laughed. : )  later.
