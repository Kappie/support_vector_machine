My mind still wanders everywhere, it feels as if I'm going to explode if I stayed here for few more minutes... My trip to Tampa is from 6/11/04 (Fri) through 6/14/04 (Mon). I'm visiting a friend, Demarre, who also has a relationship crisis just like myself although my crisis has been ongoing for more than a year. pathetic...
