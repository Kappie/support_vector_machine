Great time. So when we got back we had to wash everything like 3 times to get all of the mud out and just finished not too long ago. Im really tired and so im going to veg out the rest of the weekend and watch movies and eat junk food. YAY! lol Wednesday were all going to town agian and jeanette is going to skip school and come with us. She has such cool parents to let her do that. Im getting my hair cut then too and hopefully going shopping. So great weekend so far! Hope you all are having the same! Peace(ha ha ive always wanted to see if i could say that and pull it off lol did i?)
