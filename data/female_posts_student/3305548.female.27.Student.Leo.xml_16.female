Murder She Wrote here I come!  Library: Went to our county library last night. Got lots of books to read. A SciFi-ish book or two, some mysteries, a Dostoyevsky, and a book about the "madman" that turned in most of the submissions for the original Oxford English Dictionary (an etimologists guide book as it tracks original usage of words.) Its so funny that a place can change so much and not change at all. I mean, I have been going to that library since I was old enough to read. Everytime I had a project due for something - Social Studies Fair, Independent Study, Science Fair - I would spend hours at that library desperately doing research the old fashioned way. In fact, once when we were in junior high my now husband and I bumped into each other at that library and spent the day together. (I reference it in his 8th grade year book in a relatively embarrasingly flirtatiously sappy yearbook signing.) Such historical significance. Soon though I will be able to renew my books online. The library (which is totally a modernistic bastion to concrete block) will enter the space age. It was encouraging and slightly depressing at the same time that the old card catalogue bins were no longer present and accounted for. On the plus side, it seemed busier than I remember it being before...so their updates must be good for business. I cant imagine the tediousness required in changing a library over from Card Catalogue and Apple II E's to a networked and contemporary system. I almost miss the old DOS based book search system...almost. Now, if we could just get more and more varied new releases the library will have become heaven. My husband located check-outable graphic novels (Batman, Spiderman, etc - nothing Manga-esque or anything) and we figure that is a step in the right direction.  A funny side note: I read a story online from USAToday that was about the Interstate and Highways Bill that the House and Senate passed and Bush is threatening a veto of if they dont cut the budget on it down to a useless amount. The article was focussed on the fixing of a major bottleneck in the highway/bridge system outside of Cincinnatti - and the amount within the Bill as it stands to help solve this issue. Some of the other items mentioned in the bill are things as varied as bike paths, walking paths, and filling pot holes. This bill applies in some way and gives money to nearly every state in the union. Including West Virginia. Pot Hole filling. West Virginia. Reminds me of something the President told our Mayor last week, "Get those pot holes filled." And he's gonna veto the bill to pay for it. *sigh* In the meantime this bill has united Republicans and Democrats against Bush (for this cause at least.) The Congress cites studies done regarding the amount needed for investment to keep our interstate system current...and showing the need for the spending. And across the board the support for the bill is mostly non-partisan. It is highly possible that if Bush vetoes it the Congress will override his Veto. Woot. Hehehe.  Posted below this blog is another example of how much my new toy rocks. That is me. Me in our Jeep. Me in our Jeep that is going 45 mph or so when I took this picture. :) For those of you loyal blog readers (all two or so of you) requesting a photo...there you have it.  I cant believe its really Friday - this week has simply flown by.  Oh and yesterday we also viewed another DVD that we rented. Yesterdays fare was Kung Fu Jackie Chan Makes An Appearance goodness. It was titled the Vampire Effect. And, although we expected the worst, it was actually quite good. I voted it better than the Medallion. The story line was fairly creative for a vampire/vampire hunter flick, the characters all had their little quirks, there was some good slapstick style humor - without being too much, there was a cool chick fight kung fu style over a teddybear at the beginning, and in general there was enough bizarreness to have a good time without losing the movie entirely. The special effects were surprisingly good, and the chinese style floaty wire work (and using it alot) actually worked for this movie as vampires are in theory supposed to move like that. We enjoyed some chinese food from our favorite (and very good for being in a small ass town) Chinese restaurant - The Great Wall. And also upheld our Jackie Chan tradition of watching said movie with a friend who I will call "Pirate Monkey" since I am keeping everyones anonymity :) Pirate Monkey is a long time friend of my husbands - who I have also known since junior high. Ug. We are from a small town. Pirate Monkey is likely Jackie Chan's number one fan, and if I could I would totally arrange for him to meet Chan as a birthday present or something. We have the same birthday after all - Pirate Monkey and I that is :)  Does anyone else get tired of the world sitting at the precipice of distaster and refusing to jump off the fence either way? I do. Israel. Iraq. Afghanistan. The insanity of it all. I dont think I will ever grasp the arab-jewish issues - 1000's of years of disagreeing and not even modern conflict resolution techniques will work. Sometimes I feel like we should kick everyone out of the holy land if they cant come to an agreement. Or just split it in half in a way that makes everyone the loser - King Solomon would be proud of that resolution :) Dont get me wrong, I am very sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish people and in fact I have alot in common with the views and religious beliefs of the most liberal group of Jewish worshippers. I would convert if I believed in conversion. It is just that its about time the hotbed of humanity had a little peace. Havent enough people suffered and died for a cause and an arguement that no one truly remembers. This whole Gaza strip thing - its not really about Gaza strip. Its about whatever it was that made Abraham and his brother part their separate ways 1000's and 1000's of years ago. Which, although it is semi-documented, no one REMEMBERS why!  Well, thats all the news in fits of print...have a great friday! --Mack
