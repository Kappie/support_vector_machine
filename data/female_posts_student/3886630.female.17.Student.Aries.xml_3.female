Today, I've came across what St. Paul had wrote in Thessalonians 2, about problems that might be testing your faith-   All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed.    2 Thessalonians 1:5-10   So don't fret about this world, but do keep in mind of the Lord's Returning... For He come like "a thief in the night". And only those who will meet the Lord are those who look for Him. So, be forever mindful of him and know this- Don't put this aside ever, for the Lord will come when you least expect it.
