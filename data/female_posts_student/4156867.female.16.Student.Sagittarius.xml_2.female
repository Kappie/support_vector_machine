A sorority is nothing more than a way to let people know that you have money and are basically set for life. The sisters are crazy. They even go as far as setting up date rapes: They will drug you up on "Special K" and then take you to a designated frat house where they have already pre-arranged a guy to "deflower" the "Little Sister." It's sickning to think that there are people out there that actually contribute to rape in our society. I am definatly considering beig in a club or something, instead of a sorority. I will not subject myself to their kniving, childish, and immature acts: rape, drug and alcohol usage and abusing, aswell as health issues...eating disorders. I don't know about you, but I like to keep what I eat down, that was the whole reason of eating it in the first place...lol. But, that's just me. Make your own judgments.
