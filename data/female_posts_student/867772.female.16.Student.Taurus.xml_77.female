Let me explain this everything. Homework. Tests. Essays. My revised-but-still-sucky-play. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Mid-terms. Family. Friends. Boys (please leave me the fuck alone, because that should be the last thing for me to worry about, even though it's definitely not.)  To add to that, my school's doing Grease for the spring musical, and I tried out today. School got out at 10:45 am. I got home at 4:30 pm. The auditions were unbeleivably long. I tried out for Frenchie, but told them I'd take any part, lines or no lines. I did pretty well with the singing, although I could've been louder. I started out okay with the acting, but lost my place about three times by the end of the dialogue. I messed up at the beginning of the dance part, but I don't think she saw. I finished up fine, though. What really pisses me off, though, is that I  know  I could've done SO much better.  I fucked up, but it's not the end of the world. I know I'm not getting Frenchie, but I don't care that much. Well, it's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm not gonna break down for not getting the part I didn't expect to get in the first place. I hadn't eaten in over 24 hours by the time I got home today, not by choice, so I had some soup, sunny delight, and sleep.  Mid-terms have made me want to crack my head open AND snap my neck, both, just to make sure the job's done.  I need some serious sleep.  I've felt like a peice of shit lately. I had a cold with itchy, watery eyes, but I thought it went away. Guess I was wrong. I've been so tired, even on the days after 12-hour nights of sleep, which I used to get twice a week, but now get about twice a month. A normal night's sleep these days consists of about four an a half hours.   This is the most unbelievably boring post I've posted in a long time, and I think I'll end it now.  Oh yeah, and my little Raiders are gonna beat the fuck out of Tampa Bay.
