I am so mad at everything.  Die, penguin, die.  Bloody fruitcake black suit-and-tie carrot fool.  Jenny's the name, nonsense is my game.  Go ahead, ask me a question.  I'll answer it with the lamest answer possible.  I hope you hate me now.  Everybody else does!  I don't know.  I need to sleep.  Goodnight.
