In the midst of such finality and ceremony all I could do was stare at the sea of blue robes and sigh. I know some awesome people in there. And I just had to think, that's going to be me in a year. 365 days, Nigel emphasized.  So thanks Jean, for the good times. I love you so much, you're simply awesome. Sylvia, you are my hero. Pegleg, Keira, Brandon, Amanda, Greg, Coral and Melody, the back row in journalism will never be the same again. Parshaw, my Thursday buddy, dinnertime won't be as entertaining without you. Chika, we love Mr. Francis.  I just can't believe they're gone, you know? They haven't been in classes for a while, but they've popped up every so often. I don't know. It's just that my memory remembers them there and my perception of reality has yet to catch up.  So it's the first stage of grief: denial.  When I think about growing up and being a senior, I have to stop. I don't know, I don't approach it with the exuberance or the anticipation that others do. For one, I can't say I'm a senior until September 2, I just can't. That's when it's inevitable. But now. The seniors will always be seniors where it matters. They're just so much to live up to. They've been my role models, my friends, my rides home, hah...I just don't think I'm worthy of filling that role, of mentoring someone else. Journalism is a fine example. Without everyone, the room is empty. There's no laughter, really, no secret Super Mario, no funny Photoshop exploits, no jokes or teasing. I can't carry that weight on my shoulders.   It goes without saying that this is the class that I've become closest to besides my own.   And I think, that's going to be us next year. I'll wear a lei and have sashes around my neck. I'll be taking pictures, I'll be crying with friends. I'll see all my teachers and thank them for all they've taught me, both in and out of school. I'll go to grad nite, and come back for breakfast. And then I'll leave the bubble, the Westlake bubble.   A good argument for taking it slow.  I love Mrs. B. Sometimes I'm almost afraid I'm bugging her, but today after school we talked college and books. She gave me her SN, which made me laugh because she had one in the first place, and also since both of ours were inspired by literature. I don't think I've ever been that close to an adult outside of the family structure. Well, one more year.  One more year. What will I think in 365 days?
