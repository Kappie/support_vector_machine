Of course the advisor was out to lunch. Waiting...waiting... more waiting...Finally I get rejected! Like I would have wanted to commute that far everyday anyways. So I ring Jeff State and classes began May 26th, so that was no longer an option. Full tank of gas later, we arrive at UCD looking for a foreign languages counselor. Point A to Point G to Point Q to Point C (getting closer...) Yes Point B! The Humanities Building. Victory. I step inside my classroom which only has an entrance from the outside, kind of reminds me of camp or somewhere scary like camp. The class room had nothing in it. Just this box of cemement. No windows, no posters. So depressing. This should be an interesting experience. UCD in general is one chaotic mess. The traffic, the posted crime warnings, the parking (or lack thereof). After getting my textbook i headed home. My classes are Mon. Wed. Fri. 9:40 a.m - 11:02 a.m. Finally I have two definate commitments for summer. Horseback riding and Spanish. One plus to everything is that the workmen at the stables speak nothing but spanish. Maybe I'll get some practice in. Well for now I'm going to try and figure out bloggerbot.
