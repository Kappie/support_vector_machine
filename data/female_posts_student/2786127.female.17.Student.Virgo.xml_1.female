Strange because a main point in the show is power to women, women who get what they want, casual sex...and such. But sitting there thinking about it all...I just don't think i could ever do that. Meet a guy, date him for a few weeks, have sex many times with him...to find out that he's been dateing other women. It would tear me up inside...i would be so horribly messed up emotionally! i just can't understand people like that...how everything is so completely impersonal. It drove me crazy to watch the women have one nights stands and then carry on the next day...as if nothing was wrong with what they just did. Not that there is anything wrong with that, ugh, it would just drive me crazy! i would be thinking about it all the next day, freaking out about how the guy doesnt really care about me at all, that im just another piece of ass. BOTTOM LINE. I miss having someone to care about, and to care about me. Strange how a show about women in their 30's haveing casual sex made me miss a boy that i could hug and hold in my arms...and look up into his eyes and see him smile. I hate high school, i want out!! I dont want high school relationships anymore. I wish i didnt feel this way because i am in fact still 17 and shouldnt be worrying about finding someone that i can have a really meaningful relationship with. not that i worry about it....i just want it.   ugh. Im off. I'm sick of thinking about something i cannot remedy at the moment.
