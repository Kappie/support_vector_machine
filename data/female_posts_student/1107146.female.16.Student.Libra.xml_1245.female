I've had a long heart-to-heart with Tao Tao (used purely affectionately, my dear Rosie *grin*) and I can honestly say that I'm on her side in this, too, but not as fervently as Linds.  I see myself as a Switzerland leaning towards joining Rosie's side.  Becca, to be quite frank, is pissing me off badly.  Those little jabs I've been throwing, well, they haven't been jokes even though I said I was just kidding.  After all, who can tell with me, anyway?  As far as my opinion stretches, 1 is not an option, Linds.  This has gone on for too long and I am sick to death of it.  We either take advantage of her offer in the written format or take advantage of the offer face-to-face.  It's up to you guys, but I will go along as long as 1 isn't the solution.  2 or 3 work fine.  And I agree with Linds's analysis of Becca's little letter.  Ouch.  But it's just another strike against her...and if she was playing baseball, she would already be way, way out.  Now, on to the other subjects that have been discussed.  First of all, I am SO SORRY, Josh, about all you had to go through this weekend.  I know that this is belated, but this was the first chance I've had to take a look at this website in FOREVER.  I hope you are feeling better and if not, that you will be soon.  Also so sorry about your kitty.  But (and this applies to Linds and Abby dearests, too) I am afraid that I'm not getting involved in this philosophical debate about whether or not life sucks.  I can just simply state my opinion.  It sucks.  My family is falling apart and not only is it tearing me apart, it is also planting the seeds of apathy everywhere I go.  I don't care about anything anymore.  I'm forcing myself to get focused for school but it just getting so damn hard.  My dad moved out this weekend and I haven't seen him in at least a week, perhaps more.  Not that that bothers me...I'm afraid that I'm going to try and strangle him next time I see him because this shit that he's caused has driven me to therapy.  That was mostly for Abby's benefit, since I believe that you guys already know about this.  Now, new subject.  I am also sorry about all the shit you've been through, Will.  I kind of know how you feel about birthday parties, but not in such a severe case.  My parties, though few and very far between, have been left up to me, so I could choose who I wanted to invite and who not.  Anyway, again I am very sorry about all of that, and what do you want for your birthday?  I'm probably going to get you something anyway, so tell me something you want to make it easier for both of us.  Whereas Josh is a complete enigma...and I know he doesn't want anything, or at least he told me that.  And don't get me started on Becca...  Anyway, let's see, what else...OH!  Michael.  That bastard.  So he was scared to read my e-mail.  Good.  Let him be VERY afraid.  Nobody does that to MY best friend and gets away with it.  I hope it scarred him for life.  Anyway, he responded to it and I responded to his response...blah blah blah.  In short, he got what he deserved, the prick, and I hope that he is haunted by this for a long while.  Ahhh...that felt good.  Now, as a final note to this post that is rapidly approaching saga length, I hope that everyone gets a kick out of my goofy humor in all the right places and can pick out my seriousness, however little of it there is.  Also...PLEASE don't scold me for any of the things I've said, about Michael or Becca or whoever the hell else that is pissing me off lately...like my dad.  Anyhow, it's a brief venting phase (not with my dad, however) and I think getting that out of my system helped.    Z has returned to the building.  Everything will be fine from now on.  ;)  Sure.   ~Z
