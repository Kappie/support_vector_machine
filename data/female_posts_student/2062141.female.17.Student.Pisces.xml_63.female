HAHA omg that's great... cause that guy just looks so estatic.... and jason's like "oo i'm sexay" haha wow now i'm having them talk... too far.... but anyways, in the fan part of the photo section of  urlLink his site  there's some great ones... I'd be making this face too if I met him.      Okay and I'll leave you with this... because I based our awesome poster on this shot of Jason...the poster that he HAS now. WOO! I'm waiting for that email, Jason. (Don't worry i'm kidding). I'm not delusional.
