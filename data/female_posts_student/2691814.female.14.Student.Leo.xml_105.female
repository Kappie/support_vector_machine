I got like 7 purple ones so me and bill can invoke a spirit. We only need 5 todo that and the pentecle.   Well After francesca's i went over to bills hung out for alil while. Went home...got on the computer and...*someone* just IMs me and started saying shit to me. Personally..i thought it was funny and so did my friends that knew about it. But...i don't care...i don't even know what i did to make that person TRY to cut me down. And...does anyone in Ripley have anything better todo on spring break?...I guess that person just sits home...making up stuff about me and other ppl she hates i guess. But you know what...i really don't care for people like that. I already dealt with ppl like that and they're gone. But.. I really did have a few better things todo. Like talking to dee on getting accepted into the vet program at Colonial!!! CONGRATS!! i am really happy for her. She wanted that reaaally bad.   Today is the Yellowcard concert and its gonna be soo much fun. Ryan's coming over about 4 or 4:30 and then we'll leave at like 5 or so. Ryan-that song was hularious!!on the flo foshizzle lmao. I wouldn't try acting black if i were you ryan lol. Its too funny.   I'm gonna git u sucka!
