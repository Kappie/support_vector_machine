You can be sooo rude sometimes! In case you didn't notice, it wasn't a fowarded message, it was one that I wrote and that I sent to al my friends wishing a merry freaking christmas and happy new freaking year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know what's wrong with you, you seem to not like me when I tell you I'm tired and I don't feel like doing shit! If you wanna talk you know how to reach me!  ----------------- Girl, I don't know what is up with you!!! If someone is hormonal, it sure is not me- I'm a bitch all the time, I don't have mood swings (like other people). And by the way... have you told that to Stephanie? you know about 'quit with the forwarded messages!" because I notice she send a bunch all the time and I don't think she is stopping!!! All you have to do most of the time is ask people NICELY (key word) to stop doing something that is annoying you. You don't have to be rude! After a vacation, don't you think you should be relaxed and carefree??? Heck, I would... don't abuse MY patience... love, love  ----------------- Unsocialble? ME??? ha, ha, ha!!! Tha't funny, that's how people referred to you at school. Maybe I have RESPONSIBILITIES, not like others that only care about being a social butterfly. I'm throught with you! You are irresponsible and really don't know how to keep a friendship. I can't deal with inmature little girls, that's why I stopped talking to all of you before, same freaking reason. I tried...you obviously didn't. You only talk to me when you need someone to talk to, not to continue a friendship. Don't have time for this shit!!! You know? I have to work... oops! you don't know exactly what that is!  Love.... PH -----------------   update ...  she called yesterday to invite me to go to her birthday party tonight
