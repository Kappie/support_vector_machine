Everywhere I go now has some kind of sign that says I can't skateboard there. I am sick of this, because when I do complain. They just tell me to go to the local skatepark down at the waterfront. I hate that fucking place, it is filled with assholes that think they are better then you. Well, let me tell you something, I don't give a shit if your better than me, I just want to skateboard in peace. This is nearly impossible now because of those jackasses in suits telling me that I am going to break something if they let me skateboard in their parking lot.
