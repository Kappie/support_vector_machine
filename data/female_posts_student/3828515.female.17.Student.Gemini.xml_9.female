Anyways, today I played these addictive little games we like to call  urlLink Yeti Sports . After a while, I went to play tennis for about two and a half hours (as usual), and that was about it. Oh yes, and we washed my dad's car. While we were doing this, David started throwing these seed type things that have orange pollen on them and stain your clothes very well. So I got just a few big orange marks on my pants and shirt. Yes. And that was my wonderful, elusive day.     Last song I listened to:   Jane  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .    Last meal I ate:  Chicken, green beans, rice.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I was visiting high school marching band websites today, and band camp is in a week! Ugh...   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Moe.    Favorite song today:   Fired  by Ben Folds.    Favorite food today:  Rice.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Played tennis.   Funniest thing that happened today:  A kid on a skateboard smoking a cigarette obviously did not know where he was going, and he asked for directions to the Geneva Train Station from my neighborhood.
