I was sitting on a chair and i turned and saw some girl and then i turned back again and then i realized it was LAUREN!! and we ran up and gave eachother a hug and i guess the ppl she was meeting ditched her so she hung with me for a little then joe came and me and him just walked around and hung out then went down to sunset to see the Riddick movie. it was tight a lotta killing idk 2 many girls that would like it but i thought it was tight. lol and then we went outside and joes dad came and picked us up! it was a fun night ;).....
