Then I've got a thing about books for schools and Kegelmaster 2000 The World's First And Only Dynamic Progressive Resistance Exerciser for Women! (WTF?) Geez, apart from the fact I'd never use any thing like that... and I don't live in America great! Woohoo! Yeah, then I got stuff about becoming a American nanny, hello! I'm 13 and I live in the Uk! Weird, yeah, just pisses me off a bit (well today it does) yeah. Sorry to be annoying... eat more jelly babies! Woohoo!
