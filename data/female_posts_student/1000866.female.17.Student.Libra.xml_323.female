Why do you build me up (Build me up) Buttercup baby Just to let me down  (Let me down) And mess me around  And then worst of all (Worst of all) You never call baby When you say you will (Say you will) But I love you still  I need you (I need you)  More than anyone darling You know that I have from the start  So build me up (Build me up) Buttercup, don't break my heart   And so on and so forth....haha. Wow.   I'm watching Pay it Forward right now. It's kind of depressing and at the same time...it's really encouraging. Like, it makes me want to be a really good person, and do good things for people. Ah well, commercial's over.
