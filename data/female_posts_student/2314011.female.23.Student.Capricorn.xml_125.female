(other than the kick ass wi-fi at school, that is.)    But I've just discovered it's not just my connection; it's AOL in general.  Hmmm.  Just when I've made up my mind to switch completely, it works wonderfully again.  Guess I'll just ride it out until it irks me for the last time.    Other than that, today's been really good.  Really relaxed, but really productive.  Have the rough draft all printed out and ready to be ravished by the red pen.  Reading for tomorrow's completed; laundry folded nicely in the drawers.  And I still have the whole afternoon to do with it what I wish!  MY GOD!  Have to send a shoutout to Carrie in Fuckin'-Boston.  She hasn't gotten much blog-attention lately, and she really deserves it.  So there you go, girlie, you're very own shoutout.  I remember my first; it stays with you forever.
