I think the only people who email them are me  Cathy ... and that's kind pathetic.   urlLink CLICK HERE  to email Knapman/Wyld.  For more info on Knapman/Wyld Productions (shameless plug, I know),  urlLink CLICK HERE  to visit their official website.  And if you want to join the WCB Yahoo group - we're a great lot of people ... then you may as well  urlLink CLICK HERE !!!  Yeah ... well the last email I sent to Knapmay/Wyld, which I admit was quite a while ago, generated this response:  Dear Brittany.   We have sought DVD production interest and as yet no-one has been interested.  We have done a limited 'inhouse' run of the best episodes but these are not available for commercial release at this time. So I am afraid we can't help you, although I will make enquiries regarding the cost of a limited edition although this would prove quite expensive.   Best regards,   Steve Knapman     So please join our campaign!!! I would do ANYTHING to see that first ever episode ...
