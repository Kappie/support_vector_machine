Now, I can't tell emotions with Blogger, but it seems as though all the females (and maybe even Jason) is resentful of my comment.  It was not meant to offend, anyone!  I was just curious as to why dresses are so important.  Because, the way I saw this "dress connection" was more of a negative thing.  You know, girls wearing specific dresses were made fun of, or praised, etc.  I knew about this "no same dress rule", I have seen enough teen movie to know that. Jessie...  Never compare Tchernio to you guys, that is sad.  And never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, NEVER mention the words Masturbation and Tchernio in the same sentence (you scared me so much with that sentence, that I almost swore off jerking the gherkin)! PROM QUESTIONS:  We are eating @ Prom right?  I mean, do we wanna go out and eat before and skip the Prom dinner?  How is the food by the way?  If the food is good I don't mind going to prom for dancing and eating.  Just curious.  And what are we doing afterwards?
