Some stuff just happened n I simply can't get my mind off them.. Wad's life abt excatly? Live everydae as it is.. Or do something real meaningful everydae? Tml or rather, todae is gonna b e last dae of e 4 daes long holx le.. Mmm.. N wad have I done? Yupx.. Loadsa.. Sleep, eat, slack ard, pigging here  dere, nuaing on my bed, in my room.. Tht's abt it.. Din bother to studie.. Wanted to, but jux can't focus.. Kept saying start this week.. Start this week after another week has past.. But, dere's loadsa 'this week' man.. Die.. N palx, may I remind u, PreLims is jux less than 3 weeks away.. N O's is too less than 100 daes away.. So, jux wad all of us wan? Sigh.. Wad excately is going on man.. I jux dun wanna sae much.. Wad can I sae too..? Dun c anything fer mi to sae..   Time flies.. It nv wait.. Flowers wither n die.. Colours fade n disappear.. Hair cut n grow.. Friends come n go.. People rush to n fro.. Life carries on regardless wad happened.. Who can remember wad they've done last yr at this time wid who? We're all jux living everydae as e daes lived fer us.. People simply feel sad and cry, happie and cheer, angry and yell, confused and ignored.. Who wouldn't hide their feelings from another in fear of wad others mite think? People put on a mask to show thier best n nicest part to others.. Who dun? Everyone wants happiness, No one wants pain.. But, u can't make a rainbow without a lil rain.. So, jux cherish wad u have n those ard u.. nItex time.. (-_-)zzZzZ
