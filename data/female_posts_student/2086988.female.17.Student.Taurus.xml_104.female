At least in the long run it's all going to be worth it. And waiting every few months is worth it too. I'd take any length of time to be with David, no matter how short it might be, as long as I can look in those beautiful dark brown eyes and run my fingers through his soft hair...and kiss his lips...everything is worth it...   I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you
