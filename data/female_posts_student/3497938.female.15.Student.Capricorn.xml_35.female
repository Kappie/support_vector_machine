Im really happy that she and Drew are happy. She deserves happiness. Today I went to that driving thing. And to my surpise it was actually kinda fun. I made friends: Molly *crazy cheerleader*, Sara *sweet runner*, Caroline *beautiful, nice, kind girl*, and I talked to Joe, Clayton, and Josh. We talked and stuff and goofed off. Ted, the instructor, is sooo different. He's 52, black, and has a bad knee. He is veeeeeery outgoing and cracks jokes on everyone. He says pissed off alot, and what the h, or scare the h out of you, etc... But he never says hell. Its soo funny. But, he says stuff and is joking, and looks sooo serious. Its kinda creepy. So, this week will definetly be interesting. My mom let me drive from my house to Golden Corral. There I saw Lauren Roberts and her family. AND my 1st grade teacher and her family. It was so cool. Everything is going pretty well around here. And i keep thinkin "Well something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good." -Nickelback, Feelin too damn good.- Thats all for now... maybe more later.   I LOVE THE AWKWARD ROMANCE...
