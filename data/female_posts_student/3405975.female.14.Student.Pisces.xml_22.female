You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like "Diamonds in the Rough"    urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Kool! I like the night! It's so...dark yet beautiful and have a kind of mysterious and calm feeling to it.
