"dip it low" by Christina Milian is probably one of the stupidest songs I have ever heard, yet i can't get it out of my head! It sounds more like a workout than a sex act. I would break my friggin' back tryin' to do all that crazy shit! After all that "rollin' around" and "pokin' it out" it I would need to call 911! I swear, songs like that have subliminal messages tracks in them. cuz there's no other logical explanation for actually listening to them. I just try to listen to the beat and not the words. Most rap and r songs are like that anyway. stupid lyrics and awesome beats. if people would actually take the time to listen to what some of these artist are saying, they might not like the song so much. the thing that annoys me the most is the use of the "n" word (don't act like y'all don't know what i'm talkin' about). i don't understand why it's okay for us to call each other that, but when a person outside of our race says it, we get all pissed. I hate when another black person calls me a ni-----, it's so unnecessary. The funny thing is, most white people are the ones buying the music, which really cracks me up. so what happens if a white person is singing along to a rap song and the word ni--er comes up, is he suppose to just skip over that part? i just wish rap (well some of it) wasn't so stupid, and had some meaning to it. well i guess not all rap is completely pointless. Thank God for Outkast and Kanye West! They are probably the best hiphop/rap artist out there right now.  oh well chow for now
