NOT! but seriously a mom is a kind of burger at this really good place called carters and so if someone ever askes the question "do you want cheese on your mom?" and you happen to be standing in a burger joint at the time please do say yes. it would make your mother proud. if you had walked into the room 30 seconds ago you would think i passed out on the floor. but i just spun around in the chair like 1 time and i fell out of that chair and didnt get up for a while. true story. i wish i could make soup right now. i like soup. i have had some pretty crazy experiences with soup. i yelled at my door while eating soup. really. no lie. but what reson would i have to lie? none. my life is as boring as it is and you might as well hear all of it. well having said that i think it is my time to go. actually that was just a cheesy way to end this so i can go watch tv. really i going to end this now.
