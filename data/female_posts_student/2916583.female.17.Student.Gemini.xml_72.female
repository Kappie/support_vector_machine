I got back late Friday night; Saturday was laundry day/tidy up the house day; Sunday I had church, then work about an hour and a half later; yesterday, I took my sister to go see Anchorman (which by the way is the best low comedy since Austin Powers, no joke), saving me from having to go see A Cinderella Story with her.    Puerto Rico was absolutely amazing, but I really don't want to write about it. In fact, I'm just not up to sharing all my thoughts with the world anymore. I kept a mini journal (more to record my experiences than my thoughts), and one night I got really, really angry with my dad. I was very sick, and he wanted to eat at a Chinese place with his family,which he knows I can't eat because it makes me throw up. I was rushing to the bathroom after eating some Chinese ($12.50 for two plates, which isn't cheap, so I ate more to satisfy everyone eating with us), and it wasn't to throw up, if you catch my drift. I tripped and hit the floor before I could catch my balance, and my dad pointed it out, so he could look good for the family we only see ONCEEVERY FOUR YEARS. He then informed the rest of the family (the rest, who hadn't pointed at me and laughed), and they all laughed at me and fired quips in Spanish, most of which I could understand. I'm not the most coordinated person and trip more than the average person, so I've learned to laugh it off most of the time, but when you're sick, don't even want to see food (much less eat it), and trip trying to get to the bathroom, it's definitely not funny. Anyway, I wrote a long letter in the journal, to my dad, listing exactly why I was angry with him, and ended up not giving it to him, because he simply dismissed it as PMS (which, conveniently for him, occurs all month long, so that whenever I'm upset at the latest insensitive thing he's done, I'm automatically upset because of PMS). The worst part is that my sister read every word of it. That letter was NOT intended for her, and neither was the rant I wrote in my journal afterwards. Of course, it's not like a person needs privacy or a place to put their thoughts anyway. She somehow found the address and read everything on here, so I don't even like to write more than what will keep me out of trouble with my mom (who I'm 90% sure doesn't read this, since she doesn't like the Internet).    That said, I think I'm going to simply start a new blog, one with an address that won't catch the attention of the rest of the school. I've been thinking about doing it since I found out exactly who reads much of what I post, but I figured that since this is the Internet, it's not like I can retract what I've said, even if I meant every word of it. It's banned at school anyway (blogger.com), so I don't really care what the reaction would be to ending this. Since this will probably be my last entry, I'll most likely save every entry in a folder (in a place few would think to look on my computer), so I can remember what I thought. Maybe someday I'll make a scrapbook out of what I wrote on here, but for now, I don't have any ink in my printer, so that's not an option for the time being.   To all the people at TD, read Shaheen's blog. It's not really like mine at all, but it's very entertaining, even though I have to go to dictionary.com a few times to figure out what she's saying. The address is  urlLink www.winkalink.blogspot.com  . To the sophomores who read (I'm fairly sure that no freshmen read this, especially since I personally know only about 20 freshmen out of 600), be prepared for junior year; if you balance your time and do your homework, you should be ok. (Yes that sounds like a teacher, but it's what helped me to survive the year, which really isn't so difficult if you manage your time well and not try to take on every challenging class.) To the juniors (now seniors!) who read, good luck senior year and with colleges. To the graduates who read it senior year, live it up in college. To the random people who read, um, have a nice day.
