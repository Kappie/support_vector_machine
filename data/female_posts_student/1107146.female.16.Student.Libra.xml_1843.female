Got the possibilities up to three now:  Auburn, Georgia, and Kentucky.  Wow.  Biggest Pro: Michael can go there if he gets a schoarship.  And here's how easy it is- I can get a scholarship.  You only have to have a 3.3 GPA and a 28 ACT or 1240 SAT, which both of us have.  w00t.  Mrs. Luchsinger taught us how to play bridge last year in Study Hall.
