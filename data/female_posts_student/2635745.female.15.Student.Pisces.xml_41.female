I think I have finally realized the person I really am inside.  I have come out of my shell, I speak my mind, and I really don't care at all what others think of me.  Sorry Erica I'm copying your entry.....almost.  I have more going on in my life and discovered hidden talents.  But enough about me.  I have really made some strong new friendships.  And I've lost some friends also, but not to hurt anyone.  It was all in my best interest.  I did it to help myself not to hurt anyone, despite what they may think.  I didn't feel like I really belonged and that at times I was completely unwelcome.  I'm really quite upset this year is almost over, but then again I'm looking forward to next year also.  It will be twice as much fun.  We know now to go with the flow and not get caught up in mess of things.  Work hard, but enjoy it while it lasts.  Next year will be a time to make even more "special friendships" and hey, ya never know, we could also find our "special someones"  *if ya know what i mean*! OMG!  I am so excited for spring day this year!  That'll be another first.  Oh Well enough of that.  I'll see you dudes later.  YOU WOULD CRY TOO IF IT HAPPENED TO YOU! (that song is stuck in my head....there's plenty of room up there)
