But I hadn't realized that it was an hour, just thought it was 15 minutes or so, so went to go get lunch and got some strange looks from the lunch lady who asked why I was eating so early... Oh well.  This means I'll hopefully be inspired to find me a more healthful lunch at lunchtime instead of the chicken fingers and fries I was going to order.  Good stuff.  Spreaking of... I should find the Springs Whole Foods... that would make my fridge and belly happy.  Anyway.  And it turns out that my buddy from Spain was a mountain biker for 5 years, so he can definitely help me fix my bike.  Yay!  Now if only it will not rain...
