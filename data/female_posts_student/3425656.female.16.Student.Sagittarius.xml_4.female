I got sunburned just sitting in the stands... I am now officially a junior. WHOOP-DI-DOOOOOOO!I am going to miss all of my senior friends. I got close to a lot of them....  I wonder what Cody is doing. Do you know Cody? I do...he happens to be my boyfriend of 8 1/2 months :)  He is in Ft. Gaines camping for the weekend with his family. I was going to go, but I stayed home. I wish I would have though. We went to the Flea Market today in Tallahassee...It was hot there too. AHHHH ok....I will go....bye
