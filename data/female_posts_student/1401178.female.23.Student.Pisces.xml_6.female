It is very obvious if you see architeture (forgive the mispelling), also the neighbourhood surrounding  Kapulaga . It also can be seen from the separation inside.  As you walk inside, there's a dining area on the terrace with several tables providing seats for three each table. Perfect for dining on a sunny weather. Not recommended on rainy day though, you might get wet. Inside, there's another three dining area, separated by big open door and awning. The last and the deepest dining area has a few tables with booth-like couch, instead of chairs. Another dining area is outside, just left of the terrace dining area. It's also perfect for dining on a sunny weather. Not recommended on rainy day, although each table has their own big umbrella. Overall, the atmosphere is cozy and homy, very good for lounging or dining with friends.  The menu combines Western food and Eastern food. There's a list of pasta and steaks, also salad and soups for appetizer. But  Kapulaga  also provide a list of Oriental and traditional food for appetizer and main course.  Kapulaga  also sells alcoholic beverages here, mostly wine. The wine ranges from 39.000 rupiahs to 200.000-ish. But for those who doesn't drink alcohol, there's also non-alcoholic drinks like  Lemon Tea  (my personal favorite); coffee e.g.  Cappucino ,  Caffe Latte , etc; also fruit smoothies. My personal recommendation is  Pattaya Chicken Steak , which is chicken steak with sweet chilli sauce, a mix of west and east taste. Another is the  Chicken Salad , broiled chicken with cuts of potato and apple, covered in mayo. One thing to be remember is that the main course a big portion, so make sure you're ready to finish it all up or share it.
