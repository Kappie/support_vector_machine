You see right through me And I can't hide I'm nakedAround you And it feels so right  I'm tyring to remember Why I was afraid To be myself and let the Covers fall away I guess I never had someone like you To help me, to help me fit In my skin  I never felt like this before I'm nakedAround you Does it show? You see right through me And I can't hide I'm naked Around you And it feels so right  I'm naked Oh oh yeah Does it show? Yeah, I'm naked  Oh oh, yeah yeah I'm so naked around you And I can't hide You're gonna see right through, baby
