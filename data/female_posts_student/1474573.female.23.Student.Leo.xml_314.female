I hope LaToya and Fantasia got enough votes tonight to stay in the game on American Idol.  I felt bad that it was a night where John Stevens would have surely shined and he wasnt there to sing.  George didnt really do it for me, I think he may be the next to go.  24 fuckin' rocks.   I love in the preview for next week's episode where Tony says to Jack, "you may have been willing to sacrifice  your  wife for this, but I'm not ready to sacrifice mine!!"  That's a real low blow, man.  Jack didn't want his wife dead!  That was so mean!!  But anyway on another note... I have had a bruise on my leg for over 2 weeks now and the swelling has not gone down.  There's no discoloration, but the bump is still there.  I think I'm dying.  Should I get this checked?  It still hurts.  How can I make it heal faster?  I don't get it.  Ow.  Am I dying?  I think I'm dying.  And finally, I have a friend that's upset.  Two, actually...They've been wronged.  I think in some ways they have the power to do more about their separate situations, but they won't/can't/are not ready to...this I'm not sure of.  I do, however, know that I want to help, be there for them and all that, but I don't know exactly how.  I've advised them as much as I can about what they need to do, but they won't listen.   People already have their set ways of doing things, and set thinking patterns and I can't change that.  But in the meantime, both are miserable and both turn to me to listen.  Problem is, it is extremely difficult for me to listen without forming an opinion of my own and it doesn't always take their sides.  I am torn between taking their sides unconditionally (because I'm their friend and they've turned to me for whatever reason) and wanting to smack them in the face and say, "Snap out of it!" like Cher did in  Moonstruck .  ARGH.
