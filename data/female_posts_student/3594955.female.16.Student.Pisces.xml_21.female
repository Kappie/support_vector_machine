Eric (Jen’s brother, the one who cheated on his girlfriend) didn’t go to school today, and has been hiding from everyone for two days. He broke up with his girlfriend on Sunday, and was a real cunt to her when he did, so on Monday she was really upset about it. Someone then told her what happened Saturday night, and she got even more upset (understandable really). She spent the whole day in the guidance counselor’s office bursting into tears, which is really sad.  And I still haven’t got my phone back and I’m still really fucking pissed off about that.  "Alright, already, we'll all float on"
