So here's how it all went down- Jacklierang me and called out a DQ trip. So we gives Leslie a jingle and shes all like "Huh, what? so we picked her ass up. Then we went to vermeire graphics to get samwell and casey and they were all like "Who, what?" So they jumped on in - in between this we rang Michellie and she goes "Eh, what?"- so now we're back on the road headed to michelle and we're all like "Heed, down now!" so we get to michelle's and we got locked out and its rainin like a mothercocksucker so we huddled together under her door mabobber and theres a big foot print hole in her flowers now. So shes not home -we think- and we run like crazy motherbigchukars to lola's casa- for those playing the home game this is leslies home- and its a wicked run. 3 whole blocks for shat sake. So we get there and casey starts playin the gItar and shit flyin everywhere and theres like ninjas on the lawn so we took zee jeep back down to Michelles right and jacklie jay is all sittin there warm and cozy and sams all like would you like to touch my penis. then we drive me to work and the flamer comes with the fischer and shes all like ohhh i talked to erik... and I'm thinkin wonderful... i told him to go for it are you two hooked up yet? and i said get the fuck biatch. then ross was like you can close and dorothy starts peeling off her mole with her fuckin carpals. crazy! so then we started drivin around again in zee jeep and parked. Oh yeah and somewhere in there we bought sausage and were throwing them at pedestrians and cars and to make a long story harder to follow lola and mick left and we went and watched some robin williams and south park. Until Time Next ......Bwhahahahaha.
