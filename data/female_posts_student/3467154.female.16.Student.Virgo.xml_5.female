LOL it was Ian's party too and Katie made a cookie cake for him LOL. At Em's party we played all these really funky games like "I never" and also a psychology game lol that would have even lost Ms. Chrystman. I think Ian won that game, he got the jist in like less than a minute or something. I didn't do it...Becca's prolly was the funniest. She was in a semi-twist postiion trying to do a push-up...it was so funny. SHE LOOKED LIKE A MERMAID IN DISTRESS LOL. Also, Steve-O acted like a complete drug-high-Haight-Ashbury hippie when we went on the Scavenger hunt. It was me, Steve-O, Cindy (our beautiful chaueffer), Emily, and Abi. LOL it was so funny cuz Steve was hanging out of the windows yelling at cars which less than severely jokingly pissed me off. And I had to pee really bad in the middle of the Scavenger hunt so it was really funny when I had to use a complete stranger's bathroom (don't ask) and she had no soap so I had to use the shampoo! Would that have been a sight. Anyways, I have to pack for the week..am leaving for Cebu tomorrow late afternoon or night...will be back Friday. Plus, I think I overate today but oh well.
