In roughly one month, it'll be school again, and I'm waiting for my brain to comprehend it. Hehe, then I'll be panic stricken, running about the house screaming "OMG school starts tomorrow!". But I'll get to see everyone! :D Then I'll be all happy-dappy screaming "OMG school starts tomorrow!". That would tick my parents off either way because of my noise pollution. Hehe. Beh! :D
