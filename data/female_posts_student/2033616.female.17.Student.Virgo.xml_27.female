I took lessons as a 5th grader to, but i got strep throat the day before... so i obviously didn't sing.  Anyway  ... is on December 6th at 10 am if anyone cares.  And right now i can't decide between singing Se tu M'ami... that's italian btw... or No One is Alone, from Into the woods.  They're both fun, No one is alone is prolly easier... being in english obviously.... but i can't decide, i love them both!!!
