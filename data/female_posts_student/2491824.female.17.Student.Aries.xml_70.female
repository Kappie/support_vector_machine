Since my last post--three hours ago-- all I have been doing is homework. ..So, how much have I accomplished 1/2 of  one  assignment. Bah!  ..Well, I haven't  juuust  being doing homework.. ...I've been constantly refreshing and checking on what going on at  TEOTI . ...I swear that place is a drug. Once you get into you can't stay away at any cost.. It's horrible..  Well, I'm off to the shower...  Good morning all!
