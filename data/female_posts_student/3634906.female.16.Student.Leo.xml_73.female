Wahh!!! it was the last time that I got to see Max before he leaves us!!! AHHH I just want to cry... I know that he's only gone for like 3 weeks and that I probably wouldnt see much of him if he was here. but I consider him one of my closest friends... And now he is leaving... It's like a little swap, get Britt back just in time for Max to leave... its not fair!!! haha... Oh well I am sure he will have fun!!!    well I just thought I'd reinforce the fact that I'm going to miss him...    nighty night   -gabby
