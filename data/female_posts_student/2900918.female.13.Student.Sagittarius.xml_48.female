Spinning:  spiderman 2 soundtrack   Ytd, i had lik a class gathering with 6/11, 1/4 of the class, to be precise.  i didnt much talk to the rest. didnt relli wanna mix.  then we went to watch the best bet which kinda sucked cuz of the plot and all..  if u use that plot as an essay, u could have gotten a big fat ZERO!  0!  well, i didnt expect this kinda standard from jack neo so it made me more depressed than i already was.  Initially, i was considering whether to go or not, so if joanna go i oso go lor.  to be honest, i dread the thought of goin back, its not my idea of fun. Some things i expected to be happening did happen.  I guessed i went to the gathering at the mall was to buy the spidey soundtrack. that was my aim, frankly.  oh, i also bought cheshire cat! finally found it!!  then i went back home with joanna then she came to my hse for dinner and use the com til 9++pm.  after she went home, mom was kinda naggy. I dont know if the arguement btwn my mom and dad had already resolved(i mean she didnt come to my room to sleep today, she slept with dad), but i dont relli care.  I dont think i would even if they hav a divorce, jus as long as i get to live. i cant relli say i wldnt frick out, i dunno, ev thing seems kinda indifferent to me now, since i hav my own issues to deal with.  angst, confusion... bla bla bla  oh ya, then i think i slept ard 3am.. there was the match rite.. When it was 230am i wanted to wake my bro up to watch the match, but well, i guess its god's will that the hinges of his door creaked too loud when i opened it, that woke my "light-sleeper" mom up, who was kinda on an alert sleeping mode to catch us in case we sneak up to watch the match.  my brother cldnt wake up, so today, he woke up and called his fren.  "I cldnt wake up, was too tired to watch the match"  well, even if he did, its a 100% chance he'd get caught watching it and urging him to go back to bed.  i xpected it for my mom to be so alert.. guess its life for u, then..well, what can i say?   *note: im gonna go, "woo..haven had a long post lik this since ages"
