I woke up early to get ready and go meet Tim and we met up at the mall and then i took him to a cheap place for him to get his hair cut (he looks so good now!) and then we went and saw The Village.  Wow, thats a creepy movie.. and then we went walking around the mall and ran into a friend of mine and her mother and they met him and thought he was very cute (funny, i totally agree with them!) and then he had to leave :(  but then, Jessee invited me to go to Hills Cafe with her and her family and i'm sooo glad i did!!!! ok...here is the second part of my day...  We get to Hills, and Jessee starts flirting with the two guys that work with KVET at the 'free stuff booth' (it was only free because Steve was a genius and lost the spin wheel!) and by the way, Django Walker was singing there last night and if you don't know who he is, Jerry Jeff Walker is his Dad.  and if you don't know who he is then, YOU SUCK!!!! b/c JJW is AWESOME! but yea, i heard that Django went to LIPA University in Liverpool, England, where i am wanting to go so i told the guys at KVET and they pushed me to go talk to him...and i did...and i'm glad i did! so this is the convo with Django: Me: did you go to LIPA Univ.? Django: yea i did M: was it like, an awesome experience? D: omg yes, their vocal teachers are amazing...it was awesome M: ok, cuz i'm looking to apply there D: oh really? what are you going for? M: singing D: oh really? M: yea, i'm a singer D: thats awesome M: yea, is it hard to get in? D: no not at all..as long as you have the pipes, you're in! M: oh, thats great! D: yea, i'll tell you what..email me and i'll tell the guys there to keep a heads up on your audition tape M: omg, thank you! D: yea no problem, enjoy your night M: thanks yea, you too...good luck up there!  OMG YES!!! HE'S WATCHIN OUT FOR ME!!!!  THANK YOU DJANGO!!!!!!!   ok...so instead of watching the concert, me, jessee, her sister, and their foreign exchange student were all hanging out with KVET and got really cool FREE stuff!  and they all call me "Carry Around Portable Monica"...yea...and i un-oficially sing the KVET jingle! "Its the genuine austin original...98.1..KVET!" lol oh and yea...if you are from austin and listen to 96.7 KISS FM, the week after next you have to listen weeknights from 10 pm-5 am and sunday nights from midnight-6am!! b/c Steve-O is the DJ and he'll be filling in for someone for 2 weeks! and he's gonna have me on his show and i'm going to sing live on the radio!! woop! woop! but yea...it was great...KVET IS AWESOME AND THEY ARE MY NEW BEST FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!
