They say all is fair in love and war. So make love, not war. They say the first one always has a special place in your heart. They say it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. They say love is blind. Love is colorblind. Love is a many-colored thing. There's first love, puppy love, platonic love, unrequited love, true love, unconditional love, love at first sight, the love of your life, the one you want your mama to meet, the one that got away... So we ride through the Tunnel of Love. Make out at Lover's Lane. Say our vows at the Chapel of Love. Take a cruise on the Loveboat and reserve the Honeymoon Suite. And sometimes we gotta stay at the Heartbreak Hotel. But hey, love is a battlefield. And I'm a soldier of love.  -T. (Tatsuya Ishida, http://sinfest.net/resistance.htm)  It's a slightly stormy day outside... It's really windy and I think it's gonna rain soon. The autumn here in Switzerland has been so different from the one in Finland. No real colours, not that same feeling. It's already snowing in Finland and here it's still over 0 celsius.  Tonight is the Iron Maiden-gig we've been waiting for long. I'm not really in the mood, since I'm really, really homesick. I got a letter from my dad yesterday and he sent some photos, too. I must say my nieces and my nephew are the most adorable kids in the world... And I miss them like hell. I also miss Finland in general. I know, there would everything be easier, I wouldn't have to do all the paper work and face new things all the time. But then again, I know that I wouldn't be happy there, either. I know, I'm gonna be happier here. Last night, as I cried on Rico's arms (his hug is so secure, so warm and caring...), I once again became more certain that he's the one I want to be with. I don't know if it's for forever, but at least I'm happy now. I love him.  I am so tired after all the crying last night. But I know it's gonna get better. And my baby is coming home earlier today.
