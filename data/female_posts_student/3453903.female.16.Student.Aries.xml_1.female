Books written by middle-aged women about thirteen- sixteen year olds pretending they know exactly what happens with teenagers today, although what they really have done is read the latest article about teenage kicks in their monthly magazine, presume all teenagers think about is the opposite sex (or the same sex if they're homosexual, although gays never seem to be aknowledged in children's books. No wonder some people find it so hard to 'come out', it's as if they don't exist), the action of sex, their looks and how they appear to both sexes. Oh, with a bit of drugs and alcohol weaved in occasionally.   I've always hated this image portrayed of us. It is bad enough that so many take tabloid stories at face value, but then for people to write books in the first person and pretending to be our age whilst obsessing over things that yes, we may talk about, yes we may be concerned about, but no we do not all obsess about, and the fact that we are portrayed like this is irritating.  I have yet to see or read a book about a teenagers that portrays all characters accurately. I had always wanted to rectify that. Write a novel about a geek and what went on in their life. What really went on in the mind of a teenager. The thoughts and worries about future, about the wider world. Obviously it wouldn't be nearly as interesting to young kids who read it and read about all these girls getting boyfriends by completely disabandoning all their values, changing their personality and revamping their appearance, and think 'hey, that seems like a good idea. Lets have a re-birth and then I might get a boyfriend.   The Jaqueline Wilson  Girls In Love  books were the most accurate. The people in them worried about other things besides the opposite sex. Though not really.  Geez, I sound like a right winger. So go change that situation, I hear you cry. So what if it's boring. Well, I'm not sure. Maybe if I had started it, bowed to the initiative  before  my life became a mixture of working, revision, the internet and my going out with friends every so occasionally then it may have become reality. As it stands I never started that novel. I did, however, get a LiveJournal.
