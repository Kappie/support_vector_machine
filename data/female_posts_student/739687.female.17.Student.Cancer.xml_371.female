You know, less family drama, a bit more freedom, fewer obligations, less worries, fewer cares or concerns, a bit more spontaneous, a hell of a lot more fun/exciting/enthralling/engaging/interesting... yeah, that's what normal is for me I suppose. That's what I want at least. And that's what summer's about.   It suddenly occured to me how fleeting our times together will be - how quickly they will expire - how soon we will be gone.   None to worry, none to worry.  Life is good, life is good. Oh baby.  Okay, enough of this phrase repetition, you'd think I was singing a song. An obviously gay song. Oh wait, that gay song would be...my life..song?  Haha I'm retarded.  Live a bit more interesting, crazies.
