The most important part of that post was the part for Adam: You are the most best thing that has happened to me, don't disapeer. Everything will work out the way it was meant to be eventually. You are not a horrible person for falling in love with me, because then I'm just equally as bad as you for letting myself fall in love with you. One day it'll hit you, and don't let yourself regret something that you'll have thought at the time was a good idea.  I love you, Adam. :'(
