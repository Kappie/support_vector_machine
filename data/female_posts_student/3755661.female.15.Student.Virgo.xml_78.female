Once I find my transfer cable I put up a pic of the lake and such.  It is truely one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen in my life.  Too bad I take it for granted so much eh? Today I won my first game of hearts while playing against the computer.  I really did, I only had 40 something points and I was the first place person!! Yaya!! thats cool to me, especially since I've been without a computer for the past week and a half. I feel very computer and internet deprived.  I still have to write my essay for honours english too.  Topic: Discuss the presence of Forbidden Love in the novels "The Scarlett Letter" and "Ethan Frome." both of which are good books. I think I'll probably be the only person in my english class that didn't hate reading "The Scarlett Letter".  I really like the book and was happy to read it. I began this post with many things set in my mind to write about, but they seem to have left, so if I remember I'll come back and put them up.    Farewell.  Brie
