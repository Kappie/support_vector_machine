Some of the articles attack those who waited in lines for three, four, five hours just to glimpse the coffin were in shorts, tee shirts and sandals.  Does it matter?  Are we so superficial that we feel people need to come out only if they own a suit and tie?  Shouldn't we honor the president no matter what we wear?  Granted I don't feel that anyone should have shown up in anti-Reagan attire and as far as I know no one did.  But shouldn't we feel proud that the masses showed at all?  Shouldn't we revel around the idea that so many wanted to pay their last respects to a former leader of our country?  Granted I have my political opinions and as many no I am not by any means a supporter of the Republican party as a whole.  But Reagan was an elegant man who, when he spoke, made you believe he wanted the best for not only the country but for each individual. Say what you want about the national defecit but Reagan himself was a great man.  I feel people should stop worrying about what those who showed up were wearing and feel glory in the fact that they showed up... period.
