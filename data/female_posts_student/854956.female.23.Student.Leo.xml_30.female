My friends and I (Ricky, Mike, Melissa, Jennifer, and Druck) all went to the first showing of  urlLink LOTR:  The Two Towers  at midnight today... it was SO GREAT!  I don't wanna say anything cause I'd give it away... but we had such a good time.  There were lots of things to make fun of in the movie... and it was just awesome...!  I can't wait til  urlLink LOTR:  The Return of the King  comes out!  Next Christmas season... one year.... CAN'T WAIT!  I got to see Jennifer's Mom's CRAZY dog Jen-jen... wooo... he gets so excited when visitors come over... so excited that he pees.  We also (me and Jen) went to the store to get candy before the movie... and we were gonna get ice cream, too... well, I finally found the DMB One Sweet Whirled Ben and Jerry's ice cream at our HEB... so, YES, I was ecstatic... and lemme just say, it's SOOOOO good.... coffee ice cream always is, though.  ;-)  Anyhow, I really don't have much to say... besides if I told the entire Two Towers plot and exciting stuff... which would ruin it for those who have yet to see it... so I keep quiet... I'm really getting excited about Christmas, though... we're gonna have fun.... me and my friends and stuff.... Oh, and lemme make an announcement... Tomorrow's is Jen's 21st Birthday!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JEN!  I wonder if she'll get smashed...  That's the gloriousness of being 21... well... not really... but I'M young, and I'm gonna have MY fun while I can!  Oh... on a side note... It's odd to me that someone would need attention so badly, that they threaten suicide... for the record, I think that's pathetic... and especially when it's someone I told I didn't want to know or talk to anymore (and after he said the same... minus his calls in between his words and mine on the situation).... :-)  Okay... Enough venting... just go see LOTR:  The Two Towers... cause it's the bestest!!!!       urlLink  postCount('18Dec2002');
