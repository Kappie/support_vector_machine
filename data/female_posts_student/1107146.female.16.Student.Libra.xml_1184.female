Heehee.  anyway, since no one wants to introduce themselves, I'll semi-introduce them, and then if they want to correct me they can.  Unless they insult me, and then their post gets edited.  Ha ha.  That's what happens when I'm the administrator.  *maniacal laughter*  Anyway, you already know Elizabeth and you know of Michael, so I'll move on.  Josh is the...insane, maybe?...one.  He's a great guy.  Just slightly on the verge of insanity.  Just like Rosie, who is slightly psychotic. (are you seeing a pattern here?)  Let's see, I met her last year when she sat across from Liz and me when we were dissecting fetal pigs and she named hers after Will (her lab partner, who is also on here.)  Will knows everything.  I'm serious.  The Atomic mass of, I don't know, plutonium, right off the top of his head.  Seriously, he should be teaching Mr. Adams most days.  Probably Robashaud too.  Yeah, I just totally butchered her name, but I'm pretty sure Will doesn't mind this time.  You know Jackie and Brian too, but they never come on here, so that's ok.  Let's see, did I get everyone?  Oh, well, me.  Well, duh, you know me, otherwise you wouldn't be on here.  Oh, and everybody, this is Abby.  Um, like she said, she goes to my church, and FRA, but I'm trying to get her to come to BHS next year.  Who knows?  It just might happen.  Yeah, right.
