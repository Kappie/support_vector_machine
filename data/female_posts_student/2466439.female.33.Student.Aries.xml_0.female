I think I don't shop well with others.  Maybe next X-mas I will just do my shopping alone.  I'm not a shopper.  Her mono wasn't helping, although truly she did okay all thing considered.  I still have to get something for my dad and Judy.  Well, I got something for dad, but I need to get him a little extra something although I have no clue what.  I'm trying to figure out what kind of bike I should get.  I was looking at low end Treks today.  We'll see.  I wish I could spend my graduation money on me and not on bills.  I hate being poor.
