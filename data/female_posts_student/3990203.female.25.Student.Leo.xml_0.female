As I knew mum wasn't dead I headed of to the highland games with Paul, fantastic weather but once you have seen one huge man in a kilt throw a rock you've seen them all, so we headed into town and look round the shops and met up with Chris( supposed to be working but seems to have weekend off! look at last weekends post for info!!) and Gordon and headed up the glen to look at waterfalls/rivers etc. Though we were going to die due to chris's driving but managed to survive just.  Guys thought about jumping the waterfall but Chris took a sneaky look at his underwear and decided againt it ( he must have had his spiderman boxers on !!) so we went to the visitor centre for some drinks and went and sat down by the river for a while. Actually I quite enjoyed it. iv just been to friends house to feed her cat as she is on holiday at the mo.  I'm off out tonight with a load of friends and apparently Chris is having a party round his after. Not sure what is happening there as he has never mentioned asking me out last weekend but I'm thinking as he was supposed to be working this weekend and he's not that he may be think of something. il keep you posted. Have fun missing you all.
