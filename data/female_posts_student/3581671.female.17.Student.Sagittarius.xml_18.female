All smelled of a nasty odor, but I did get a silver chain that will match my WP outfit, and other things too.  I went shopping at Nordstroms last Saturday and wanted to get another pair of Saltwater Sandals but they didn't have them in the color of size I want or need.  Sad.  Oh well... Gotta run! katie
