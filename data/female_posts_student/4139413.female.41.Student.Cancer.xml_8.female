Maybe, if I can figure out all this Blog business, this will be a way to get it done! I have read some of my sons postings, and it seems like a pretty cool way of getting my thoughts out there (like anyone is really intersted!) But I might surprise you all with what I will  have to say - once I figure out what I am doing and how this all works! Later!
