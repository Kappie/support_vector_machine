No, it's not enough that I have to deal with shit from day to bastard day, now it gets ten times  FUCKING WORSE! I've had about as much as I can take, and I am on the edge. One more person pisses me off...and I will flip! I mean it...I will actually go fucking nuts. Yeah, I was upset earlier...ready to cry but now I'm listening to Eminem and it's making me fucking angry. I feel sorry for everyone in this shithole of a house because pretty soon I'm gonna snap and go on a rampage! Hey, who knows...maybe I'll smash the house up again and get the fucking POLICE on my back like last time...FUN!   I haven't felt like this since December, and I'm actually scared incase I go back to how I used to be. I don't think I could handle all that shit again, but I recognize these feelings and I recognize this mood. I don't wanna go off of the rails again but I can't control my anger! There's seriously something wrong with me. Basically what's happened is I've now got another personal fucking stalker, I've been in another fucking fight today, argued with me mum, Nikki ain't talking to me and every fucker's bein funny with me. And not forgetting Shane who keeps pissing me off about James n won't stop until I set him up with my sister .  If there was a random person here with no identity n no family and stood infront of me shouting "Hey! Leanne, kill me!" I fucking wouldn't hesitate. But unfortunatley those kinda people don't exist. Therefore I am forced to sit in this   WANK   of a life hoping and praying that some day the constant and endless   SHIT   that I have to deal with will some day come to an end. Obviously it won't because I'm not that lucky...and God hates me...   Yeah...so fuck the little miss   FUCKING SUNSHINE   that everyone wants me to be...I'm sick of it! I'm sick of people, I'm sick of myself and I'm sick of life. But at the moment I'd rather kill others than myself...that's gotta be good right?   I can't believe I feel like this! This is the old Leanne and I don't wanna go back to the old Leanne! She hurts people, she's selfish and she's evil. She shoplifts, she smashes things up, she manipulates people and fucks up their lives, she gets the police foned on her, she cuts herself and she's full of hate. She's more trouble than she's worth...   Hopefully I'll feel better tomorrow, infact I'm actually praying to God that I do...otherwise I'm fucked Have a nice   FUCKING   day everyone
