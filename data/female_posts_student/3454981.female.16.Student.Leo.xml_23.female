For the most part it was awesome, the only parts I didn't like was that one kid on the trip complained the entire time and also that my sleeping bag somehow didn't make it to Wisconsin with us. I guess one good thing is that my mother says that I've lost weight and that now my skin is "just glowing"   *rolls eyes* goodness gracious I didn't lose weight, she just wants to imagine that I am a size 4 again--which, by the way, would make me...oh let's see, 50 lbs underweight for my height! She means well, but I am just far too tall to be    that    small. And as for my skin "glowing" I didn't get any sunburn or tan at all---but I suppose my skin looks like it's glowing (glowing white, perhaps) whenshe haven't seen me in a while. I really do need to put a picture on here of myself, but I'm just a bit afraid of people finding out that it's me. As I said before, I've found people from my high school on Blogger too--eeks! But enough of my talking for now because I really need to work on shortening my posts on here since the last few just dragged on forever without me even saying much.
