Even though I put it off all week, I finally did it and now I'm exhilarated and just a little bit proud. I think I just need to make one excursion a day, and I won't feel so freaked out and sorry for myself. I think I'm really working on this whole fearfulness thing. It's really pulling me down, I just need to push myself and challenge my fears more regularly.
