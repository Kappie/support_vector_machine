Tonight we (Amanda, Holli, Patty, and myself) went to go see Mean Girls. It was ok. I thought it would be different than what it was.  Then afterwards we went to Shari's for some sundaes.  It was fun. On the way home Amanda was driving, and I see a stop sign coming up, and Amanda isn't slowing down...so I'm like "isn't that a stop sign?" Amanda then slams on her brakes just in time and was like "yeah, good job" I found it to be funny. Also, a Cher song came on (we were listening to the 80s channel) and Amanda totally starts singing along, and me and Patty just quietly laugh. It was amusing to say the least. Hmm....other than the events of tonight, today was pretty uneventful. Hopefully this weekend will be better.
