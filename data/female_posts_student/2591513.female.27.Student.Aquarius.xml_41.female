I really don't know what is wrong, but I hope it is nothing but stress induced ailment.  I just always dread tests.  I am going to hang out in the van for most the day while Ed takes Bailey on a field trip.  I am sure it will be okay.  I HOPE it will be okay.  Wish me luck.  My MRI is at 4, so I should be back on here posting...on second thought, I don't know when because Ed has class.  Anyway, we'll see.  Only one car again, teh civic is acting up...anyone have  car they can loan us?  Take care everyone.
