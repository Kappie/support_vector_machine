Have you ever though (nope) how it's admazing *hehe* that you can see some one every day of you life, but say that you don't really care about them. Wow, I really don't make sense. But... you know. In school I see people every day, and will do for a few more years *groan*. But I never have them over, or get to known them better, but surely they must be really important in my life? Is it hard to keep people in your web of friends? And even harder to link up? I dunno, because there is no right answer, life is confusing. It's made to be like that, otherwise we would all become WSL's named Mandy *shivers*. No disrespect to Mandy's but... you must feel like Barbie's with that name! (Btw that was disrespectful) Umm... look! A three headed monkey! *hehe fools*
