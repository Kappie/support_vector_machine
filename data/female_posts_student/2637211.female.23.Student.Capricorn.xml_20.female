All of my snarky brain power is currently being diverted to papers about the dehumanizing aspects of the colonial project, the meanings and conflicts in the myth of the west as compared to the actual history of the west, the evolution of the Republican party from one of principle to one of money, and last but not least, the role of race in Spanish America in the 16th century. Yes, I've been spending way more time worrying about the past than I have been worrying about the present. I'm trying to keep myself abreast of any big news, but that's the extent. After graduation: more time than I know what to do with! Plenty of time for blogging.
