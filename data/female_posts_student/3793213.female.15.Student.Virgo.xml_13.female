Well I woke up late and didn't have time. I brought it upstairs to fold instead of eating breakfast and my father sees me and starts ripping things out of the basket telling me I was selfish and that the clothes were wrinkled. Rather then argue, I burst into tears. Not only did I cry but bawled, and was unable to stop until eight thirty. Well into my NWEA testing. So I had a rather embarrasing visit with my guidance counsellor after resolving that Sanford was not going to see me break down. She, as a result,  wrote down in her little book that I "bent" under pressure and that I was fragile. I am neither of these things, considering, and was a little offended. But I had explained to her the situation. That it broke my heart to hear my dad call me selfish after all I had done for him.     There  is  a point to all this.   So my dad spoke nothing of it that afternoon and acted as if nothing had happened. I hate that about my family. No apologizing. Just pretend. No, I do not think that is acceptable. But, the point. My Dad and Stepmom have just won the all time achievement award in being selfish, horrid people. It began as little, tedious things but has been balooning. They came back from Bermuda and started to have "alone" time. Alone time was in translation going out for an hour for "coffee" leaving me to babysit much to my dismay for I have better things to do then run up and down the stairs for a paranoid eight year old spoiled brat. That wasn't such a big deal, but it did bother me. Then they started buying things for themselves telling us when we asked for things that "they didn't have the money." These purchases were elaborate, things like a new Lexus and flying lessons and a hot tub...ok no money, right. Normal people can afford those things. I don't think so. So then we progress to a very, very selfish act. They started smoking again. They knew how proud we were of them, and how much we care about them being healthier. So, about a month ago, Nicholas, my youngest brother catches my stepmother smoking. He, to say the least, was not a happy camper. I was dissapointed. So then my dad starts up. "We'll just be weekend smokers" they say falsely. One night they were "stuck" with me and brought me with them for Thai food. They asked me to go get us a table inside, this was a THURSDAY, they were going to have a ciggarette. I said to them, I'm dissapointed in you both, really very dissapointed. They didn't care, I walked off not paying heed to them saying "don't be mad" Blah Blah Blah. I got us a table. We ate. We went home. Here is the icing on the cake. I get in the car tonight to go home after working when I wasn't scheduled to work, a six to eight thirty shift, which isn't bad at all. So my dad says, you have to go to your moms next weekend. Why, I ask, I have to work all weekend (well I know now I don't have to work sunday), Oh, we're going to Nova Scotia, taking a cruise, they say. Umm Mom is going to be pissed, I say. Oh well he says. I'm not calling her, I say, I don't want to listen to her scream about you dropping me on her, I do a skit of how the conversation would go. He says, well thats tough. I'm getting angry. Why can't I just stay home, I'll walk to work. You're only fifteen he says. I'm turning sixteen in a few weeks I say. That's too bad, he says. I feel myself starting to turn red with anger. Fine. I say. Selfish, horrible people. I say in my head. So I call mom. Mom screams, I cry. I can't do anything about this, I say. It's out of my hands, it isn't as if I booked them a cruise and said, Hey, you haven't been selfish at all! Your so giving and kind, go on a long weekend! No, no I did not do that. I have full intention upon staying in my house at least friday night. I'm not going to be the bad guy. I'm not the selfish one. I 'm not the one who gives her daughter the brunt of the screaming. I sit and I do homework, then I go to work, then I do homework. Yes I'm just so selfish, trying to get good enough grades for my parents just for them to say oh, thats good. I must be the selfish one, because you know, I babysit, and give my BROTHERS money instead of me getting even a thank you. I work, I try, I do all that I can and I get brushed aside. They actually tell me to my face that they can't wait for me to leave. Well good, because more and more I can't wait to leave a home where I am treated like a blister on a finger, a nussiance and nothing more. They are selfish people and I am NOT happy. Maybe I'm over reacting but, you know what, if your parents did that, would you think they're selfish. SELFISH SELFISH  SELFISH !!!
