I think I said that in my last post.   I got a lot of housework done last night; I did the dishes and changed the cages and gave the piggies their much-needed baths. Today I still need to do more dishes, refill the fish tank, clean the bathroom, and do the laundry. Oh, and pay the bills. One of them, at least, since Todd isn't going to pick up his check until Monday.   I was thinking about getting my hair trimmed today. I desperately need to. I also really need to go down to Earthborn and get a 10-gauge retainer stud for my tongue, since I seriously doubt that it's kosher that I have one while I'm student teaching. Guess I'll have to put that off until Monday.   I am going to go work out today, woohoo! I really need to, especially since I was bad yesterday. I did okay for breakfast, eating some cantaloupe. But the office ordered Red Lobster for lunch and I had a Caesar salad, two of their cheesy garlic biscuits, and a big plate of shrimp and lobster linguine. It was good, but I'm sure there was about a million calories in all of it. Then later, Kelly went to Dairy Queen for everyone and I ended up getting a small strawberry cheesecake blizzard (my favorite). Later in the evening I had a Mt. Dew and a couple slices of pizza. Ooh I was so bad yesterday. So when Todd leaves I'm going to go to the Y and do some running, do some weights, and then some more running. And I'm going to attempt to read chapters 3 and 4 for math methods while I'm doing that.   Todd has started calling me Noodles instead of Butthead. I can't stand that nickname... It's fucking ridiculous! I'd rather be called Butthead, to be honest. LOL I swear he comes up with the craziest shit sometimes.   Speaking of Todd, he's going to go over to Harrisburg today and then he and Tyler are going to Metropolis to play in a pool tournament. I'm going to stay here so I can catch up on everything, which is what I'd rather do anyway because Donna's going to be working and I wouldn't want to go watch the guys play pool. Todd told me that the tourney doesn't start until like 7pm, so he'll probably end up staying in Harrisburg for the night. Woohoo house to myself! Whatever will I do? Maybe once I get everything done, I'll finish the rest of the margarita mix that's in the fridge.   I'm kinda hungry. Mmmmmm waffles. Blueberry waffles!   Damn my ankle itches... I put some hydrocortisone cream on it but it doesn't seem to be helping much, so I'm doing the best that I can to ignore it. I wonder if it has anything to do with the Olux or the fact that I have stopped using it like the Dr. told me to. I'm going to see him for a follow-up on Tuesday... I wonder what he's going to say. My arms are now 99.9% clear but you can still see the spots on my legs although they are fading.   Alright, I'm going to get going so I can do something productive with myself.
