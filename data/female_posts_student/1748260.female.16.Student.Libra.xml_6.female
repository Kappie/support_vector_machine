Alright, juz now I went to Jen's house. I took the bus 53  changed to the bus 315 since the bus route for 53 changed. But the way to Bishan is slightly longer for the bus 53. *sigh* Anyway, the bus 315 took quite long to come today. Then when I got up the bus, a couple was like kinda staring at me. I was like thinking, "Damn! What's their problem man!" Ok, after looking at them for some time. I kinda like made out what were they talking about me. "Girl or boy? (in chinese)" Well, I was wearing some blueish-green cap. But c'mon it's so darn obvious I am a girl! They also think that I don't understand what are they talking about. Well, when I got down the bus, they still looked outta the window  stared at me. I stared back  gave them this kinda "sour frowning" look. Ok, I thought that was the end of it. I went up to Jen's house, yak awhile. Then I told her about what happened in the bus. After that, we decided to go down to Serangoon Central for dinner to eat hand-made noodles. Coz the one at Serangoon Central's really delicious  filling. $2.50  yet it's a BIG bowl. Haha. Then when the 315 bus came, we got up  GUESS WHAT?! I saw the couple again. I was like darn it. Coz this time I took off the cap  wore my hairband when I was at Jen's house. I whispered to Jen that those 2 were the "PROBLEMATIC SOULS" juz now. Ok.. the girl kinda like saw me  whispered to her boyfriend. BLAH! I was thinkin' "Oh man! What is this?" Ok forget it. I guess they muz be saying. "GIRL LAH!" Haiz..dunno what's wrong with 'em also. Thank God I had some patience  I was trying to endure, or else I dunno what might have happened. Oh yea, today I took the temperamental test at  urlLink http://www.xenoscleveland.org/temperaments/temperament_test.htm  My sanguine rate was 26 (the highest), followed by Phlegmatic which was 7, then Melancholy was 6.. HAHA choleric was only 1! Hmm... funny eh? Well go take the test  see what you are then!
