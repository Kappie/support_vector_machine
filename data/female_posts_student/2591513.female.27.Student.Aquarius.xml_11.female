Ah life....thank goodness the marriage isn't going bad, huh?  (*knocking on wood*  don't want to jinx myself...) Ed and I are doing great...pending any further deployment...he seems to get into these gray area situations...and I love him to death and know that they are never intentionally mean or done to hurt me...  Anyway, I have BIG TIME money woes and it is starting to dampen my year...Pray that we get out of this frickin' money hole we are sinking in...  On the UP side...Emily is 11 months old today...and we are getting ready to prepare her first birthday and her Christening the following month...busy busy busy....she started to walk on the 7th, by the way...yeah my babies are growing...
