As much as you don't want it to, everything will come to an end. Also, you have to live your life for yourself. I have spent years trying to make everyone happy. I have hidden the true me in random cuts and scars that cover my body. I make myself this way. I hide away all of my emotions so that I will fit into this cruel and enforgiving world. I find myself on my knees, begging for acceptance from others while I lose respect for myself. I don't even want to spend any time with myself anymore because I hate who I have come to be. I am going to say it now, loud and proud, for the whole world to hear it! I AM ASHLEY COLLINS AND I AM A GOTH!!! There, Mom, Dad (whoever you are), all my relatives and all my friends...I AM A GOTH!! Deal with it! I am not going to change who I am just to please any of you!
