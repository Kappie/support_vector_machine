(Wasn't that a 70s sitcom? hmmm)  Lyndsay's birthday party was great... even though Kayleen did throw me in the pool (along with Laura's help). Swimming in your clothes is kinda fun actually. C'mon, ya gotta admit that.   I came home at sat up reading until 3 in the morning. Thats most likely the reason why I didn't even come downstairs today until 3 in the afternoon. The book I finished was one of the best books I have ever read.  The True Story of Hansel and Gretel: A Novel of War and Survival , by Louise Murphy. Its all about WWII and the Holocaust. I think everyone needs to read it. See, this is what it looks like:     Now go fetch.   Ugh... I am doing laundry. I hate it. CURSE ALL LAUNDRY! Thats one of the reasons why I don't like having my parents be divorced. I have to do my own fucking laundry, and that sucks.  Sucks suckity suck suck sucks.  I don't have anything else to talk about. So... ermm.. bye?  Yah... bye.    "I think there are more truths in this world than there are artists"
