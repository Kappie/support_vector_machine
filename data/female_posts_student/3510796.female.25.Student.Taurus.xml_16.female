So, yes, the Lakers lost tonight.  I don't like to think of it as the Pistons winning, since I am only passively rooting for the Pistons to win, while I'm quite actively rooting for the Lakers to lose.  Anyway you slice it, it's some baaaad basketball being played out there.  I long for the days when a team could put 110 on the scoreboard... and lose.  Mind you, some of that was available in the earlier rounds of the playoffs, and now we're left with a style of hoops that gets you 110 points combined by the end of the 3rd, if you're lucky. On a completely unrelated note, I looked into the Friendster phenomenon earlier today.  I read an article about it a while back, and my friend Britt is on it, so I decided to see what the fuss is all about.  I didn't sign up, mainly because I don't get it.  Is it some kind of dating thing?  You just meet people, somehow, through someone, and then something happens.  I don't know about it, and I'm really reluctant about throwing a pic of me up there for all the Friendster world to see.  So, what's the story on this thing?  If anyone out there can give me some feedback, it would be ever so appreciated.  7 days and 8 hours (give or take a few minutes) until Grey and I are on the lawn at The World, taking in all that is good and Dave.  For all kinds of reasons, I can't wait.
