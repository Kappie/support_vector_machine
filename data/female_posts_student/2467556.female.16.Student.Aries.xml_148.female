On our way to chili's, i blew right through a stop sign because i was pointing out Mormons on bikes on the corner to Nadia because i don't think i've ever seen mormons on bikes before.  Nadia even told me about the stop sign before we got there.  We went to Chili's and ate, then we went to Grapevine Mills to walk around.  It took us 10 mins to find a parking space!!!!!!  Also, on our way to Grapevine Mills, this bastard of a guy who obviously has a coroporate job, almost ran me off the freaking bridge!!!  I was changing lanes and i looked behind me and signaled etc etc and at the moment that guy was way behind me.  Well, he decided to change lanes right when i was changing lanes and he also decided to speed up like crazy!!!  So he's all honking at me like i did something wrong when i didn't!!!  I'm like what the hell get off the frickin road if you don't know how to frickin drive!  Sorry, my road rage lol.  So after we got to the mall, we walked around for an hour and didn't buy anything.  I think we just had fun driving around coppell.  So then we decided to go to Sonic for Cherry Limeades.  On our way there, we stopped at stop lights and had "dance breaks".  We were jamming to 90's dance music!!!  So we're in the car dancing the time away and this lady 2 lanes down was laughing at us and she gave us the thumbs up.  It was awesome.  So we went to Sonic, got our drinks and sat there for awhile.  Then the song, "Move Bitch, Get out the way" by Ludacris came on and we decided that was the theme song for my dad's land rover.  Then i took Nadia home and i went to sleep.  Today is....BRITTANY'S 16TH BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!  SO WISH HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!!!!!!!!!  today, my Aunt Patty decided to dump her 3 adorable yet oftentimes annoying kids on me tonight, so i can't go do anything.  I can't even celebrate Britt's bday by running over and hugging her to death!!!  Its ok, at least my uncle will pay me.  I hate this though, she does this all the time to me because she knows my mom won't let me say no because she's a family member.  Lets see....i'll be watching them from about 5 to 10/11 because of my uncle's 20 year reunion....3 kids under the age of 10....thats about $6.50 an hour....so roughly 36-40 dollars tonight.  Awesome!  oh yeah, if you haven't seen harry potter 3 or you don't mind seeing it again, lemme know because i haven't seen it yet!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
