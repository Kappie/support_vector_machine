This calls for another round of 'Things that make Heather incredibly angry.'  Round 1! Okay. Sometimes people have more than friendship feelings for somebody else. Therefor, that person wants to get closer to the other person, for this instance we'll use 'victim' in refrence to the other person. . . Kay. At the same time the 'hunter' is hoping that the 'vicim' feels the same way. Now, normally, the 'vicim' would show this by a thing called massive flirting, more than norm contact (verbally and Physically) and by many other things. We like to call that leading the 'hunter' on. If any of you are not familiar with anything I have just been ranting about, I suggest locking yourself in your room, listing to mad amounts of emo, and if you are totally lost, call Ben. . .  Continuing. Now, there are circumstances,  when the 'vicim' is, how should I put this, socially retarded. Well, Ima put this into diffrent terms. There basically users. Gay friznucking assed users. ArGh! That makes me so mad. And if you dont know who I am talking about, I honestly dont think you have any right to be reading this.  Oh well. Im going to go, were all going over to Harry's and then to the buhl club for swimming.
