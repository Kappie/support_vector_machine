Ooh yeah it's cause I've got nothing to do. Any way I could be watching tv! I've gone a bit mad playing the piano allll the time, like practising tooo much! It's cause I like hearing the music and I guess you could say that it's one thingt that you can stick with and it won't confuse you! Ehe. I need to phone Laura and have a good old rant...good idea. Have a nice day!
