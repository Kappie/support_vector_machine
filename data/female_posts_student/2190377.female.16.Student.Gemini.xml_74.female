However I am very happy because my family spent about $650 on electronics. We aren't like friggin' rich either. Unfortunately I also blew my entire paycheck. Aieeee.     Canon Powershot A60 digital camera, its only a 2 megapixel camera but I don't think I need any better since I'm just an "amateur"  Random camera accessories... camera bag etc so I don't break the damn thing  256 MB flash card (extra camera memory)  Color all-in-one photo printer dealie. seriously effing nice. LCD display and you don't need to hook it up to a computer since it's wireless.   Faster wireless router ... I don't really understand what these do  Spiderman and one of the Matrix games for Xbox, Prince of Persia for PS2  The nice cd player my dad bought my grandpa for christmas last yr, since he can't figure out how to work it (understandable considering the dudes 94)  My brother's old DVD burner since he's buying a new one... not yet in my possession but still   It feels like christmas!!! especially because this stuff is way better than what I got at christmas (i think... honestly I don't remember what I got)  Except it's not as cool because I financed about $200 worth of it.  We got the camera at Microcenter and I swear... it was like if you took TJ's computer science team, made them 1.5X dorkier, and fast-forwarded 10 years.  I was the only white female there, well, besides my mom.  So, the other day I had this really nice... sentimental entry written.  It took me at least an hour to write because it was the survey thing that was addressed to anonymous people.  Well, my session timed out and I lost everything I had typed.  So... sorry.  Basically it was all... blah blah I love lots of people.  But a couple suck. yep!!  blahblah.  end shallow happy entry.  boring yes.  sorry.
