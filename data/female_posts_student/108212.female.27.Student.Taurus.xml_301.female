Has anyone seen this Pinoy movie called "the debut"?  I've been tracking it for about a year now and for some reason they dont want to break into the New York Market.  They've finally placed screenings in the East Coast last Christmas out of all places Virginia.  Whats wrong with "the debut" producers that they dont want to cash in the movies worth in the larger Filipino Market in the East Coast?  Sorry for being such a pain but they began screening this movie called "Adobo" and it bombed in the reviews.    just putting my 2 cents into this.  Sex toys... coming to a small town near you.
