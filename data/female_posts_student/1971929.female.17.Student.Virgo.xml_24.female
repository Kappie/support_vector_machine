It was excellent, and good medecine. The only thing was having to look at him the whole time. I'm really confused about the whole thing. It's hard to decide whether or not I still like him. On the one hand, all I'm hearing from people is that he wasn't good enough, I was too good for him, I'm too pretty for him, I can do much better, blah blah blah, and all that gets me thinking that maybe they're right. I mean there wasn't really anything fantastic about him, other than the fact that he's the nicest guy I've ever met. Well, he was at first. Then on the other hand, he's Lucas. However, talking to Ross has made me realize that because of his lame reasons for dumping me, he wouldn't exactly be a very commited husband, so there's really no reason for me to date him ever. After all, the whole purpose of dating is to find the person that you want to spend the rest of your life with, and why would I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who can't even come up with good reasons to break up with me? I sure hope that made sense.
