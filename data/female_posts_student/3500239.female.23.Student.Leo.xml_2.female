Most of the furniture is gone, including the DVD player so poor Jude couldn't watch his Veggie Tales.  but the boys had a lot of room to run, so thats basically what they did.  Back and forth, Back and forth across the living room into the kitchen and back again.  Laura was visiting form Boston so the boys got to stay up late to visit.  We all had dinner and it was a good time. We went to Noah's 1st birthday party this weekend and it was so much fun.  Jude managed to hurt himself...twice...but nothing major.  All the moms reacted way more then I did, but then I'm used to Jude hurting himself at least four or five times a day.  Hes yet to do any serious damage so I try not to freak out.  The highlight of the party for me was when little Noah got a bit overwhelmed and started to cry. Jude RAN right over to Noah's highchair pushing all the grown-ups out of the way shouting "Noah! Noah! Ok? Ok?" He even pushed Noah's Dad out of the way to get to his friend in need! It was soooo sweet! I was putting Eden to bed a few days ago, I gave him a kiss and said goodnight, and he sits up and says "Mommy, tell me again where is my pankanese?" I said " you mean your pancreas?" and hes said "Yeah, yeah, that! My pancreas! Where is it again?"  This is what happens when I study for biology class during the day! He is absolutely fascinated with my book and the illustrations, but has made me promise not to show him any "Yucky pictures" of actual organs. He saw a few on accident one day and was completely grossed out. But he knows all about his pancreas!  Nay
