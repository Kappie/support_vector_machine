This could be kind of fun. Taking a random job and writing a research paper on it, pretending that what I desperately want. Maybe I should think of something totally off the wall. That would be awesome.  Maybe I'll say I want to be an astrophysisist. Or ah, I don't know. Maybe a mailman. That would be fun to research colleges about!
