A guy like him doesn't come along very often. There are a few problems, but nothing that can't be worked out. I think I have a hard time believing he really likes me. I don't know why he would. He probabaly doesn't, after all the shit I've put him through now. I wouldn't blame him. And I don't think I want him to like me. I can't handle this anymore, and I'm gonna cave soon. If we did end up going back out, we'd end up back where we've already been twice. I don't want to hurt him any more than I already have. So I guess it's settled. Me and Dan are over for good...
