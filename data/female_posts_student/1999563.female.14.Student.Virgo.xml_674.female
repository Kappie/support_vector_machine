At the moment, my lovely brother Matt is using my Imac so I must stoop as low as to use my eldest brothers [Jacob] lapot. Fun stuff.  Have all you guys read the verse on the right column?? It's one of my favorites.  We are supposed to be transformed by the renewing of our mind!!! This means that we are transformed through learning. I just wanted to chalenge you all instead of laying around all day like a normal summer, read! Write! Explore!! Do something. Learn. God didn't create us to be lazy!!!   Today I went to this concert in the park. it was pretty spiffy!! It was this awesome band who just played the beatles and such. They even played some queen!!! There were these two guys dressed up as hippies and they went into the very front and started dancing and the lead singer dude was like "WHOA!! We have some real live hippies right by our stage!!" they had signs that sad "Love, Peace, and chicken wings" it was quite amusing.   I checked out the menu for the thai place and the most expensive meal you can get cost 12 bucks. If you are really cheap you can just get rice for a dollar. Haha. I am quite excited.  MANDY COMES SOON!  Be excited, very excited.
