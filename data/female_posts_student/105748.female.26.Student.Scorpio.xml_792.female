The first time I saw this movie was on PBS during a cold stormy night that made our night much warmer.  In less than two weeks, it will be Thanksgiving.  I am hitting the gym this week twice per day just to make sure I am ready for the food that will be filling me belly.  Lately, Dot has noticed the belly growing.. I am starting to look a couple of months pregnant.  Eating junk at work has made me gain about 15 pounds in the last 8 weeks or more!  Im even starting to think about running 2 miles a day just to lose the weight.  Gotta stay focused.  Any suggestions? I did a search in Yahoo and Google, I dont see a lot of interesting movies that begin with Y.  How about other things that begin with Y can that suffice for a word instead of a movie?  How about Actors whose name begins with Y?  Y? because we like you....M.. O.. U... S...E...   more to come.  NET
