I know all the things I'd like to say but I also know I need to keep some diginity.  I'd like to say that I love him more than life. That I need him. I need to be around him to feel him. But I know that I shouldn't. It wouldn't make the least difference, I'm sure. I need him to know how I feel without going insane. Its eating me alive.  So please anyone point me in the right direction. I know that my relationship is over with him, and that I feel the loss more than he. I just need the right words to get my feelings across. Any and all comments would help. Thank you.
