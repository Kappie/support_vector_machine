Ryan and I got into an arguement, my mom thought I was high, my friend Maki came over and than it rained. We were in it. Yay... ha! It took atleast 5 min and we were drenched. Mhm, my mom just got off the phone with my Doctor's office. They're going to drug test me and my little brother. So now I can prove to my mom that I havent done anything. So now what BIATCH! I can't believe my mom thinks I'm a pothead, hah. It's prolly only because of me dating Ryan... Eh! So now today Maki and I are going to meet our friend Kramer and go eat pizza, around 12... LOL, Pizza is the best man! Hmmmm, we're just sitting her listening to music. Fun!! We're going goodbye...
