I know its Carmen Electra... and she has this horribly stupid rainbow on it but I heard  urlLink aerobic striptease  is a great way to exercise.  But really, the cover is just to much, you wish bitch.  She's pretty but that done up photo just makes her look horrible. And I don't want to go to work!!!!!
