Actually, there are two!  Both 'platypuses' and 'platypi' are said to be correct in the English language!  What do you think of that?  I'm not sure why 'platypi' is correct, however, as that suggests that the word 'playpus' is of Latin word.  (Latin words that end in -us have a plural form ending in -i, such as 'fungus : fungi' or 'octopus : octopi'.)  The name 'platypus', however, comes from Greek words.  The Greek words platus (flat) and pous (foot) were combined to form the word platupous (flat-footed).  thank u linz (and brother glenn)
