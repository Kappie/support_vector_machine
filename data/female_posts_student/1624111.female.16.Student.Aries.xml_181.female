Can't i just want to do something with you without having anything i want to do?  why do you need a reason? how 'bout cause youre my friend? and i wish i could talk to you more? and i love you like crazy? sounds good enough to me.     and i probably shouldnt write this on here cause people'll think im mad or that i got yelled at or whatever and neither of those are the case, just... yeah. life's too busy sometimes for 2 people to be as good of friends as theyd like to be. i wish that wasn't true. but...life cant always stay busy. theres summer... there're breaks... there are weekends...   i dont know where im going with that. I want to do one of those crazy hugs though. i seriously do. before schools out... or maybe before school starts next year. whichever turns out to be a more realistic goal. maybe the last day of school this year? like in a celebratory, determined way? like.... "we made it... and things could be so much worse and theyre not and i love you and we have the whole summer to stay just like this...nice and close." or...thats bad wording, but you get the jist. and then we will go to the zoo!  and take crazy pictures.  and be cool friends. :-D.  and i need to write a spanish essay... but first...perhaps i shall eat some corn?
