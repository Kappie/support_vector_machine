Hmm...friday i had my Alg 3 final and i know i failed it but what can ya do? It was a half day and me n Rachy went straight to the store and bought 3 packages of velveeta mac and cheese because it was my dream for the day. Went to her hizzouse and cooked it and ate it...amazing! I ate more than i should have but it's so fun to eat and nothing tastes better than mac and cheese. We also watched Goldmember and between that movie and Rachel's comments, i didn't stop laughing the whole time! She has these little Goldmember figurines and wow i can't say i hated them at all. Yesterday i just chilled all day and it was a GREAT day for little girls named Meg! :) Today i chilled too. Mostly slept because my back feels like it's broken and i felt like i was gonna puke nd pass out. Yay! Must be gettin old.... Well its dinner time for kids who sleep all day! Aloha!(aloha means hello aaand goodbye, you silly ass!)
