Also went to a local restaurant to investigate a complaint to do with a dead fly in there soup( yuk)  Today went to a shellfish place to do an inspection, bit smelly but actually very interesting!! Then Maryese and I popped in to local cafe for a coffee and a piece of cake, the joys of working!! haha.  Hoping to get off early this afternoon and head of with Chris for the weekend, were planning on a spot of camping!! im having to have great faith and trust in him in the fact that he is organizing everything, including food!! god i hope he remember a tin opener!! ( well im working and he on holiday so he has more time than me). Im also praying the weather doesn't change for the worst, rain + camping in Fort William/Scotland= Midgies!!
