He is not going to have to do both guard duty and helpdesk during one shift, apparently they are alternating shifts, one shift guard duty and one shift help desk and so forth. He didn’t seem to happy regarding this decision and is even more unhappy with the fact that the shifts include only one person, Jesse told me that you need to have at least two people per shift. I haven’t really spoken with him these last few days but I know her is ok. He is still unhappy with the current situation but then again I thank god for every day he is safe and not in Iraq. I can only hope that the ARMY doesn’t get the brilliant idea to relocate the 319th.   Today I was thinking about how now Jesse is talking about coming home on leave in September or sometime after. I wish that they hadn’t screwed up on his request; it would have been so nice to have him home for two weeks in the summer sometimes I wonder if the ARMY is really about family, or if they are just selfish and only think about what would be good for their staffing and what would be good for the camps that our soldiers are stationed at.   To tell you the truth I think I have thought more about the ARMY in the last five months then I have had to in the entire time Jesse has been in the ARMY reserves.
