I called it dust catcher, because my favourite books, 'His Dark Materials' are about Dust. Y'see, Dust comes to humans, and children only 'catch' it when they reach a certain age.. the age I'm coming to. Seemed appropriate, I guess.   And the tag line? Ah. Well, that's because the heroine in the book was fated, to end fate, as it were. But she had to do it, without realising it. She had to do it but be free to make mistakes, while all around her prayed that she did not, yet were unable to help her. Good stuff. Sometimes I feel like that, tied to one fate, and unable to change it so I thought it was also appropriate.   I'll get about to telling you about the world of sorrow I'm seemingly trapped in soon enough.   *grin*
