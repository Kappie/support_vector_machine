Anyway they have this funny number lip synching to this fast paced song and both of them with no shirt on.  I will try to find it on my computer temp files and maybe I can upload it for you couriosity seekers.  Again, I apologize for any controversy I have created and for any loss of employment I may have initiated.  ~Sigh, the webmaster might kick me out next  =)    (_)_)~Net  UPDATE:  Try this on a safe computer.... urlLink TESTLINK .
