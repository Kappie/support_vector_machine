At any available moment I have been making high-pitched noises and I have no clue why.  It reminds me of me as a 9th grader, I was the weirdest kid then.  I would do anything random at any time pretty much.  I was weird and I embrased that fact.  I have no doubt gotten weirder but when did I start keeping it on the inside more? I hate it, it feels like I'm in a cage or my own normalcy.  I used to question everything that interested me, everything.  That's why today has been so weird cuz I also started questioning things like I used to.   *STOP HERE IF YOU ARE DUMB* Randomly in the car today I was talking to my mom and I realized that life and time is 49.999999999 something percent experiance, 49.9999999999 something percent expectation, and .00000000001 something percent right now (even if that).  Experiance is everything in our past, and you think you're past has little to do with you but it doesnt, its half of your life...the rest is expectation, what you look foward to, what you have in your future to do, thats really what makes us live...we thrive on expectation, it's like a drug.  andwe always think that the present is so important but when you really think about it right now is tiny...its pretty much going in a split second from past to future....past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future past future....HOLY CRAP! and that's our life...thats it.  Now that I've depressed myself, goodbye
