I didn't go to Dave's party because I had way too much work to do so yesterday afternoon / evening I sat upstairs and did my art and as much of my textiles as I can (bearing in mind the machine I borrowed from school broke, helpful). I think I had like a 40 minute break when I was the phone to Jackie and that was it. Okay so maybe 40 minutes is an exageration. I don't know. However, I didn't sleep well because I was stressing out way too much. I need these final pieces done but I can't do them. I still have all my English Lit to do and I can't do it because I don't have the time. This is way too much and if I am not careful I will probably have one of those anexity attacks or just generally freak out.
