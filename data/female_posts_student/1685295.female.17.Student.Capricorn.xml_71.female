And 'Rifah, didn't you pick up that band from an  unspecified  mini-disc player? ^_~  Sorry I can't be online tonight, peaches, but I'm stranded in Ossining (stupid *job* thing) and won't be home til late tomorrow . . .  if ever. ^_^  So, uh, *Sue*, joined us, have you?  Does this mean you're actually going to be Sue Ann like I originally thought everyone was saying? ^_^  Who else is joining?  'Cause Dead' joined awhile ago - and yes, you dork, we do love you. ^_^  I got to drive around today. . . ah, well, I got to be driven around.  Lots of daydream time . . .we all need to go hiking.  Like I said, daydreaming. ^_^  And work got out early, which was nice.  No song contribution tonight, my apologies.  Hugs.
