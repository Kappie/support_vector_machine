Love     Love can be as strong as Waves rolling across the seas Or soft and subtle like jazz And wind whistling through the trees. Love can be expressed in what we say, Showing that we really do care, The way we act from day to day, Or even just being there. Love is faithful, it sympathizes, Cares, listens, and understands If it is hurt it doesn't despise It laughs, cries, and never demands. But the ultimate gift of love to us was given, Love unselfishly died so we could be forgiven.         so yeah my poem for Valentines day.. hope yu all had a good one (mine was great!!) and yeah..!!    "Happy Hearts Day!!"
