Let me tell you, its the breakfast of champions.... or well... breakfast of lazy fat ass kids like me and Steve. So, spent the whole freaking day cleaning, doing my mom's laundry, cleaning my mom's bathroom, cleaning my mom's bedroom, etc. The things I do for her and what do I get in return? Nothing. She wouldn't even let Nick come over to watch Lilo and Stitch with me. Stupid bitch. The only other thing I did today was listen to some nice loud music to piss off my stupid whorebag of an older sister, because well, she's a stupid whorebag. So the listening of music went as follows: Story of the Year (Page Avenue) something like 2-4 times, Alkaline Trio (Good Morning) once, Incubus (Morning View) once, Brand New (Deja Entendu) twice, and now its on AFI (Sing the Sorrow) which I haven't listened to in quite a long time. I would have included the fabulous Motion City Soundtrack somewhere in that playlist except that Amy STILL HAS MY CD! But its ok, I can deal with it, because I love that crazy kid...("He's SO MEXICAN!!!!") Oh isn't this lovely? My mother is now yelling at me to turn my music off. My response, turn it up so I can't hear her telling me to turn it off, then when she comes upstairs screaming, I sit there looking downright confused and yell back "What??? I cant hear you!!!" at which point she proceeds to shut off the music herself by throwing the stereo at the wall. Then she continues yelling while I sit here singing to myself as though the music was still playing, while my mom, overwhelmed by frustration, storms out of the room, cursing to herself...... or I could just turn the music down....NAH.... haha If my kids were as obnoxious as me, I'd be just as insane as my mommy.
