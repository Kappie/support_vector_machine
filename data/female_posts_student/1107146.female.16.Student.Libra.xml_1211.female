And the commandment thing, I obviously knew it was a commandment, but I didn't know it was the 7th.  Sorry to burst your bubble Lindsey.  Guys are jerks.  I agree.  AHHH!!!  I have terrible news!  One of my favorite guy friends is being kicked out of FRA!!!!  I'm so bummed.  I'm going to try to convince him to go to BHS.  He's very cool.  I know you guys would hang out with him....right?
