Its unreal to me how long this shit takes.. really!  When i got pregnant back in 2000 i freaking had medicaid the NEXT day!  But now, when im in a ton of pain and unable to work they take their sweet ass time..  its been 4 months i think since i applied.  Anyway, i will be at LCC tonight working on my math class.  Who doesnt love math, right?  lol.. i hope the sarcasm can be heard there.  Theres this really creepy guy though that i always see there.. even two semesters ago when i was there!  And he always follows me around and stares at me.. its really weird.  I hope hes not there tonight. I hope the huge semi-retarded kid isnt either.. cuz he REALLY creeps me out!  lol.. i know im so mean but its true.  And then fire up for Nick and Jessica tonight!  i hope i make it home on time.. I know, im such a loser..lol.  Watch for my post tomorrow!  it should be a good one:)  I'll be hanging out with my friend Tania.  We always have so much fun together:)  Even though i know i scare her probably.. lol.  euchre status: like 1720 weight status: too much
