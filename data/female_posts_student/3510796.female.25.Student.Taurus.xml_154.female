Ch, Ch, Cha, Cha, Cha, When you wake up in the morning and it's quarter till one, you brush your teeth, Ch, Ch,Cha, Cha, Cha.  When you wake up and it's quarter till one?!?If you wake up and its 12:45, you better be going back to bed, NOT brushing your teeth. Thats BS. Believe me, they take care of their teeth, but not in the wee hours of the morn'.        Usually I think about stuff to write about when I'm not sitting at the comp. When is that you ask? When I'm at school, or out with friends, or just doing other stuff. I wish I had a cool job, like a strip club manager or a NYC bouncer, but I dont. I have two four year olds. In my opinion, thatstougher than some job at  da club . I could be wrong though, Ive never been the macho-man kicking people out. I know some, so I'm not talking shit about the business.    =)    I dont know if I have mentioned the guy superfly used to 'date'. He was the bouncer at The Bar. He was even going to move to Vegas and be a cop out there. Guess that fell through. We call him Kaz. He has this long polish last name, and even ifI told you, which I can not do, you wouldnt be able to say it. Polish last names are funny like that. Two of my faves, just as an example and I'll get back to Kaz, are--Sienkiewicz and Piasiecki. Now, those are second nature to me. Maiden names of my grandmothers. I can say them and people know what I am saying. You say them and  fuck em up . No worries. Another good one is, Prentkowski. Pretty simple, it is pronounced just how it looks. Wow, now that Ive completely managed to get off the subject, lets get back to it. Kaz, yes. The 22 year old bouncer who has since quit working  the job  and now only comes down once in awhile and hangs out. He used to card people and when he thought their ID was fake, he would ask them their sign. So one night when I was down there, chit chatting, he told me about this little trick he had. So I thought Id check him out, see if he was up to par. And I told him my birthday and he said I was an aries. I said, No, Im a taurus. He whips out this little card he had and showed me. I told him that I was on the cusp and always went by taurus as my sign. He said it didnt matter, he was still going to use that method.
