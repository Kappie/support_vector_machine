No, not because I watched "The Ring" before I went to bed, (which, by the way, has at least 1/4 of material that I still don't understand,) and certainly not because I feel guilty about not practicing very much violin this week.  Speaking of "The Ring", does anyone actually like it? I personally did not find it scary at all. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it in the first place. Or it's probably because I'm Asian, and the Japanese Version was much more scarier. Or maybe because I watched the Japanese Version when I was 10 (and too young), and I didn't bother to watch "the Ring" until now, (and I've grown up, plus I know the plot and shit). Or maybe because it was on HBO and they cut out all the disgusting scenes...  No, no, my dream has nothing to do with not practicing or other horror stories. It's actually a very normal story with 2 main characters (apart from me) having tea and talking. My character doesn't even do anything but observe them.  But it's bugging me so much!!! I don't know why my dreams bother me so much. And it always affects me in real life. And I've been thinking about that dream all day already.
