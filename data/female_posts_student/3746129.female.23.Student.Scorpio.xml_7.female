The Goddess now calls  to my weary heart  her messages speak  sung like a lark.  The beauty that lies  within my grasp  is nothing more than  a pagan task.  There is nothing  left for me here  so off I do venture  with stinging ears  for my time has come  and I shall now pass  into a land  with no present or past.  The winters are not harsh here  and the summer's not too warm  for my restfulness will be longer  than my stay on mortal shores.  Await the rebirth I will,  with a renewed heart,  for the Goddess is my kinfolk  and from her wisdom I willnever part.
