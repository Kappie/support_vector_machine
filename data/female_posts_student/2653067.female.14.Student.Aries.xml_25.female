ISN'T ONCE ENOUGH?!".  If you're thinking that, you're partially right.  I am going to be ushering for 5 of the 6 nights the show is on.  When I heard the announcement that people were needed to usher for the musical, I couldn't say no.  Ushering isn't the greatest job but hey, now I CAN say that I was part of the musical.  The reward for being an usher is that you get to see the show.. FOR FREE!  That's an awsome deal if you ask me (the tix are $12 but I get in FREE!).  Now if this musical is as good as HAIR was, I will enjoy seeing it all six nights.
