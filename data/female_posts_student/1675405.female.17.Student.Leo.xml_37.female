Enough said...  Later though, a really cute college guy came in. I've never seen him before, so he must have been from quite a distance away. He was joking with me and asked me what sandwich I'd recommend, blah blah blah. His *father* walks in, jokes around with me some more. A few clever comebacks (on my part) later, he tells me "If my son comes to visit me more often, I'll have you to thank for it." As if that wasn't enough, he later beckons me to his table and asks me how old I was, and was flabbergasted when I replied that I was merely a junior. What was he up to? Trying to hook his son up?! Ha.
