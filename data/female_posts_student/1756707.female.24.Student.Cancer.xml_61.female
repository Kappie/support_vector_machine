It seems that most professors who blog are fed up with academia and looking for an outlet. Also super interesting. I've been thinking of redoing my blogging, giving it a large overhaul, where I do an academic blog for others to read. My personal blog is well, too personal for that. Plus, even I get a little bored with the "today I did...." stuff. But I'm not interested in only griping about academia. I wonder why they are.
