I kept on having weird dreams. Let's just say that I hope that nothing in my dreams last night ever happens in real life.  I'm still kind of dazed. It's that time in the morning when you know everyone back home is going to sleep until 11:30 too, so you can't expect them online.  Today's my meeting with Beth. Jenn and I both agree that it scares us, walking in to talk to her about our theses...I don't understand that feeling of dread, but it happens. As soon as I brush my teeth, etc. and get some normal clothes on it's going to be work out a thesis time. Well, I guess I already have one, kind of, but I don't know if it's good enough.  Isn't that what life is like? "I don't know what's good enough."  It's cloudy today.  I figured out yesterday at ABP that I could count the days left directly by knowing what day of the month it was. It didn't occur to me that at three weeks left, August started. So today's the sixth. I have about 15 days until SSP is over. Wow. And then a few more days on top of that until I actually am in sunny, wonderful California again.  It's not that I'm homesick, really. It'll just be nice being done with all the papers and work and all. And I'll still see Charlie and Jenn around, so no sweat...  Yeah, I should go. Bye, you guys.
