She got accepted at the theater school at Emerson in Boston, approx. 800 audition and 25 get accepted...and she was one of them.  I wish I had a money tree in my backyard *sigh*  I hate thinking about colleges now.  I'm tired of it, and I'm only a junior.  I'm sick of hating myself for ever letting a grade drop to a B (I currently have a B+ in math, and usually have a B most of the semester but somehow it always ends up an A) I'm just tired of it all... it's gotten to the point where I can't remember if I want to go to school for me...or for my mother.  I donno.  When I have finally become pretty good friends with a nice guy and start to have a crush on a boy (which hasn't happened since Nash...teehee) one of my best friends has to tell me that she really likes him...gahh. I know...stupid high school teenage girly crushes...but these relationship things? I am just so totally clueless.  It's a nice feeling knowing that both my best friends had sex this year and I haven't even had a first kiss...haha...i know, that's no reason to want a first kiss, and I don't want to get desperate or anything.  I'm a patient girl.  I can wait....
