He was really nice though, and he had a cool car.  Then we all (Katie's boyfriend [i dunno where he came from!!!] Sara's boyfriedm Katie, Heather, sara, and I) went out for sushi! Hahhahahaa  My mom is in a super good mood today so she was like "Want to go out for breakfast?!?!?" so I was like cooooool! So we get to go to downtown portland for breakfast! Haha. I am quite excited.  Then I have to go to CYT again and be and usher.  But its okkk!  Lalalalalallal
