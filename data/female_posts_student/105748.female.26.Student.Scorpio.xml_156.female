We here in Kansas have been pretty much unaffected by it all. There were rumors that floated around about a price-hike in gas right after the incident. Of course, all of us gullible Wichitans lined up at all of the gas stations to fill up our tanks. Yes, I was one of them. Brian's dad actually took it further and went to Sam's Club to stock up on canned goods, etc. Roads surrounding McConnell AirForce Base have been blocked off, making it difficult for Brian and I to drive to-and-from our house and Derby (to take care of Pogi). The checkpoints have not helped Wichita traffic any.    At work we are collecting funds to donate to the Red Cross through our Eddie Bauer, Newport News and Spiegel phone customers. Many people are afraid that war will ensue.. I'm worried, but optimistic that the situation will come to a peaceful resolution. I'm hoping, anyway. Let's pray that this is all over with by the time my parents have to return to the states.
