I hate Sunday's. They're always so boring and a little depressing because you know Monday is coming. Luckily, I don't have to work on Monday.  I went to go see The Bourne Supremacy last night and I was a little disappointed. It was kind of the same old, same old, run-for-your-life-even-though-your-innocent story line. In the first movie, he had Marie and he had to figure out who he was and why these people were trying to kill him, and the audience was along for the adventure in his search for Identity. In this movie, we knew the whole time that he was afalsely accused CIA agentand it was just him running from the bad guys. The action was good, the acting superb but theplot needed work. And what the heck?Hollywood took some liberties with the book when they killed off Marie. I wonder what their thinking was behind that. I could understand if it would kick Jason Bourne into revenge mode, but it didn't really. Sure he was sad and mad and upset but he was just trying to figure out why they wanted him, he wasn't really out to get them. All in all, this movieis doomed toTinsel Town'ssequel fate- 2nd movie, 2nd best.  While I was at the movie, I saw a poster for a new Johnny Depp movie called  Finding Neverland . It's about the author of Peter Pan and his inspiration for writing it. Kate Winslet, and Dustin Hoffman also star. Hurrah for a Depp Movie! I only have to wait until Catie's birthday Oct. 22 (sniff sniff). Gasp! what if I wait all this time and it turns out to be a terrible movie? So far the movies I look forward to ( The Notebook, The Bourne Supremacy ) always seem to disappoint, so I'm going to underestimate this movie.  Finding Neverland  looks pretty lame, and that Johnny Depp guy, no one ever understands his weird movies. And Kate Winslet? She made one worthwhile movie, she'll never make another Titanic again...   ahh. I think I'm going to go read my book now,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  Oprah's new book don't you know. Until next time, Toodles.  PS. Amit,your Xanga won't let me comment. I don't know if you have to change some setting or if I need to do something. Let me know.
