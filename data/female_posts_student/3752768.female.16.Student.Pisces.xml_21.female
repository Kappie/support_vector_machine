I went and I got Ryan and we went to eat REAL food. He took me to Taco Bell! I havnt had real food in 3 days!   We went job hunting and Baskin Robins was in a big bind to find work so thank god we found them.   We came back to my house and we watched the Secret Window and then we went and got Butterfly Effect! I love that movie! Ryan didnt just because Ashton Kutcher was in it. Then he went home and that was that!
