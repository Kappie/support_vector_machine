(read: things that involve technology that could've been on the jetsons.) i'm in a graduate program that focuses on theFUTURE, otherwise known as the bleeding edge of technology.  i'm doing stuff that goes over the heads of the general population. it is very fucking cool. and you should visit me to come check this stuff out.  i have a futon that's booked at least 2 weeks in advance. i wake up (when i'm actually at my home base) to a view of glittering tall buildings, shining in the sun.  these buildings' lights romantically bleed into the body of water (that separates me from them) at nightfall.  it is beyond picturesque, and it is a view that can be seen out of 8 of the windows in my tiny little apartment. i'm a city rat, as in the type of person who gets nervous around empty spaces, country lanes, as well as gigantic parking lots.  i'm afraid when my eyes can't grab onto anything in the surroundings. i'm a travel junkie. i only want a job to support my travels, and if it required me to live in england a double bonus.  what else would you like to know?
