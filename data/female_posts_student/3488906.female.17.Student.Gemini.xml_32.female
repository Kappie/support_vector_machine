I told myself to go at least the gym to get rid the circles of fat around my waist but once i'm at the club, i forgot everything and hardly feel like doing any workout. Darnit. how can i achieve my goal then? what about the weight? studies? Shit. i'm not well-disciplined anyway.  Ate pizza today. No, not only pizza. i had lots of food. Went out of control and got a bulging stomach.
