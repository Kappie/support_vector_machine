The only thing it was really good for was for the promotional and propaganda purposes of the Chinese government. That night Wusong gave me a gentle rebuke for not writing up my fieldnotes, and I said fairly casually "oh well, it's all meaningless anyway". He was a bit taken aback by that, mostly because he had come with me to live in China for three months, teaching a class of 80 bratty teenagers who weren't interested in English, coping with daily diarrhoea and trying to get about with very little Mandarin -- only to find that I found the whole thing meaningless anyway!  On discussion, he discovered that not only did I find my fieldwork meaningless, but the degree it contributed to was considered meaningless, and even the possible jobs leading on from the degree meaningless. I told him it was actually biblical because of Solomon's famous line "Meaningless, meaningless, all is meaningless. There is nothing new under the sun." He wasn't impressed, and asked me what was the point of coming over here, and making all the sacrifices for my degree? -- holding his breath for another "meaningless -- there was no point" answer.  But fortunately for our marriage, at that point I found some meaning! I told him that the relationships and the friendships with the local people here were deeply meaningful. The effect that they had had on my outlook, and the kinship that had built up between us over my time here, in my opinion, made the whole thing worthwhile.  I no longer had merely a vague, altruistic future aim of "helping people" -- but a sense of belonging in a community, a community to which I could contribute something of my own skills (along with all other members of the community). But my contribution to the community was not the defining characteristic of my relationship with them. The relationship comes first, and the contribution is just a small part of that.  I'm not sure if that makes sense or not, but in sum -- the conversation basically concluded that the relationships were the only meaningful thing (considering all the complications and ethical dilemmas and uncertainties of development work), and my thinking after talking to you brought me to the conclusion that 'development work' is just an aspect of the relationship.  I guess I come at it from a Christian perspective, in that relationship with God is the ultimate aim in life, seconded by relationships with 'my neighbour'. Jesus' two greatest commandments don't mention development -- but he does assume that 'loving your neighbour' may involve a bit of that -- but its not the purpose. If we cultivate relationships in order to do development that's merely an egotistical motivation -- helping our careers, or even just making us feel like we're a nice person, a good person (that's still for ourselves right?). But if relationships are our goal -- not our goal exactly, but our motivation -- and we do development as a consequence of that, it's possibly a longer-lasting and purer motive.
