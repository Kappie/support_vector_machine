Lets see... since last post i've finished leadership camp, taken some practice senior pictures w/ my dad (which turned out pretty good), got my senior overalls (now i just have to make them), and i got my hair cut yesterday. It's just a little shorter and a few shades darker now... a lot closer to my actual hair color.   Today is my last free full day of summer. Wow... i can't believe that... i think i'm kinda upset now. Tomorrow is the first day of band camp and it won't be as bad because it's wednesday and we don't have night time band camp.   All of my friends are back in town and it's very nice! I do love them because they're a lot of fun and we laugh a lot and i like it!   I just went to walmart w/ leah to buy her new rims for her car (because one had fallen off so she only had 3)... and the rims that saturns come with are very very plastic. we changed them in front of my house and it was funny because we're both not very smart when we're apart, and when you put us together we're still not very smart. our hands got all black and we felt like mechanics, but it was funny because she thought that pliers were called a wrench, so i was looking for a wrench and it took a while. And to make it even funnier... she just informed me that as she was driving home, before she even got out of my neighborhood, the rim that I put on fell off and rolled down the street so she had to park her car and get it. and we were so proud of ourselves....  I guess that's about it...   Bye!!  -Lisa
