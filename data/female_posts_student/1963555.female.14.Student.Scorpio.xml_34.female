I don't know why but I think their awesome! so they broke up a while ago and the cd I want is now out of print so basically I'm screwed. I really want that cd! somebody please sell it on ebay!! I really want one of those great Simple Plan sites to post somthin new fro me to look at!! GRRRRRRRRR I dunno. This must be boring to you so I'll skip to Question of the Day (QD) Q: running in your back yard bare foot, how many bugs do you think you just squashed??
