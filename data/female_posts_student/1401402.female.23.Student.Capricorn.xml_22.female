Everytime I yawned, theres tears in my eye balls and if I was to blink, tears would probably drown down my face. Every yawn, my eyes gets really red and my nose as well. Co-workers walked by and everyone of them seem to find me very amase. The first questions that comes from everybody this morning was "Are you okay Sakdary?". The Second would be "Your not crying are you?". At this point I'm sitting here thinking that I should sign up for an addition. A crying role, perhaps lol. Nah, I dont think I'm qualified for anything. Damn, I might crack the camera lens. Oh well, yawn*, here goes another yawn* and another and more yawn*. Shesh. While writting this, there has been at least sixteen yawns* already. Dude, I need some coffee. Anyone care to take a trip with me to Starbucks? My treat :) !!!!
