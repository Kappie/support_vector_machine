I have swimming for an hour in the evening, and she has the gym all day? I don't think so... Go to a BBQ next Thursday in the park, but can't take loads of people from Reigate etc as Ami doesn't want it ruining things for others. I feel stressed out again, Jason not being here worked wonders, maybe it will be good when he goes off to Uni somewhere, i know i won't be able to see him, talk to him etc and maybe it will help, so only another year like this, woohoo! I hardly have much money either and i don't know where its gone, my boss is annoying me and i need to work out how to ask for a pay rise or i'm going else where. Laura just annoys me because she has Jason, and they seem so happy, she wouldn't be so happy if she knew what i knew, not even that keeps me happy these days, i used to love knowing that i knew and she didn't but i can't tell her or anyone that i know will tell her or i'll lose Jason and he said that on purpose as he knew that i wouldn't say, but she told Eliot yet he still loves her? But thats because he didn't care about our relationship anymore because it was past it in his eyes and it would never be the same. I wish i could get him back, but for some reason hes caught on her which annoys the fuck out of me, he would hate it if i went to Gray... He would fucking hate me and try and kill Gray, so how the fuck does he expect me to be? Its been nearly 10 months and i still wish i was with him because i can't find anyone else i click with like that, and hes looking so damn good at the moment and i just hate her, shes not lucky shes a bitch and shes just using Jason as she couldn't get Marc, and if only he saw it. Let me have another chance, what did i do wrong to not deserve to try again? Just remember what we had and how much fun it was and how much i cared and you did too. You loved me Jason, as much as you thought you could ever love and you had wanted me for a long time, and we clicked. Now you have someone who you know cheats on boyfriends and who you know was with Marc... Come on, just try me, i'll never hurt you, i never lied to you, i always wanted you to be happy.  ~Lisa~
