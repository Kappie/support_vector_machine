That was good except what was with all those drag queens? Anyway - WOOHOO! After hours of trying i have finally managed to put my hair using chopsticks! And it looks artisticly messy! Or so I keep telling myself...  Yeah I know my spellchecker's bad, but that's hotmail for you. Soooooo tomorrow! Woopee - Loadsa people coming!
