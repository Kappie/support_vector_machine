I couldn't get my teeth to stop chattering, and my body to stop shivering, so I was just laying there half alseep for a half an hour. Then I started having this crazy semi-dreams. I was like, half awake and I started having a dream that the marching band was marching through my room and around my bed and Mr. Headly was yelling at me because I just wanted to sleep. Then around 2 thirty I got this really really bad stomach ache and it still hurts, making it really hard to walk.  So thanks a bunch to all you drama dorks who didn't come to the prop room cleanup at the junior high. It was discusting. This was actually this first time it had ever been really cleaned, and we didn't even get it totally done. Even though we went and bought masks to keep from breathing in the dust and mold, I have a feeling that shortened our lifespan about 93 years. *cough cough* oh god it hurts to cough...  So then I got my homecoming pictures and they turned out ok. The only picture that didn't come out was the one of just me, but it was ok. Now I'm really really tired, and amanda never called me about the anime thing, but oh well. I'm done here. *snore*
