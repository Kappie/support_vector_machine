Come Thursday I will be the proud owner of a very pretty black 2001 Volkswagen Jetta (yes, before the Pathfinder I had a different Jetta and neither are the one pictured above).  Its so pretty; it has grey leather interior, a sun roof, tinted windows, nice alloy rims, heated seats and lots of other goodies.  Also: its manual so place bets now on how long it takes me to completely anihilate the clutch.  I think I'm going to name him Trevor (my last Jetta was named Travis).    So uh...anyone wanna buy a Pathfinder??
