Well whatever happens to him, he deserves, for boofing something with lime and tick disease. Also I hope he gets a severe ball disease. Ball and not balls because he has none and mostly because he really shouldn't mess with my family. J.B. is family.   In case you were wondering... this is mike at his crowning glory. The only thing worse than a has-been is a barely was...      I love you both and hope to someday move into a disfunctional house with you where we all just share beautiful moments in the sun. I want a summer's eve commercial. And I want you to use summer's eve... in Michael's ass,  Hearts *Gia* Hearts
