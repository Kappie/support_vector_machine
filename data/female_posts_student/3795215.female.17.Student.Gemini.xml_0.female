First, my friend, Nick, came over and ended up elbowing me in the lip so now i have very sexy ;) Angelina Jolie lips... not quite as nice as hers... but mine have a pretty blue tint. lol I went riding around with Nick a little later... cuz that's pretty much all there is to do here... and we ended up sitting by the lake in his truck looking up at the stars... our nights together usually end up like that.  It was nice... semi-peaceful... but filled with tears as always.  Oh the trials that high school sends us through. ;)
