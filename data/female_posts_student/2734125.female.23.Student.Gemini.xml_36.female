Its time to turn out, energy flowing out into other places.  Thank gods that there are cycles.  I rode this morning at 7:30 and didn't have to wear a coat!  Squeee!  Makes my heart beat in a spring bird rhythm and think about dancing and weddings.  Genetic memory of new food and long days and hard focused work flood back in a thunderstorm.  I think that I will have to call a thunderstorm this spring.  We haven't had a real one in so long.  I want one that makes mud and overfills gutters.  Where there is screaming and passion in every flash of photographic electricity.  There should be heat in the rain and vibrations on wet bodies that dance in the storm.    I just got done being at the dentist here on campus.  I think that it was one of the most kind and informative dental visits that I have ever participated in.  Mary, my oral agent, was most kind and gentle.  She explained to me all of the things that are not so good with my teeth, what I could do, and even gave me a flossing lesson.  The doctor, a slightly distracted but amusing older gentleman, went over what I need to have done, and put my work into priorities so that I could get the important things done first.  I would highly suggest a visit if anyone has the option and needs a dental visit.  I also bought a new super sonic high gizmo tooth brush with carrying case.  I am told that this item will make my teeth shiny and perfect and will also keep them in my head for a long time.  This is a good thing, so I thought, what the hell?  If it saves me 300$ in dental work, and cost 100$ its a deal, right?  That was my reasoning anyway.  Most likely not the most responsible buy I've ever made... But then its not something entirely pointless like shoe rack that rotates, or a self cleaning wallet, or a vacuum that can clean a cat.  I did find out that I have to start using fluoride... This is a little disturbing to me, but Mary was very insistent.  Fluoride makes a close friend of mine sick.  I have always assumed that anything that makes him ill is most likely something that is making me ill with out my knowing it.  While this hasn't stopped me from eating and buying somethings that he cant use, I do put more conscious thought into it.  That and I am very fond of my Tom's of Maine Tooth Paste.  It is comfortably not sweet.  It makes my mouth feel cleaner then most other tooth pastes, and it is icky enough that no one steals it.  I think that I will compromise with Mary, though she doesn't know it.  I think that I will use the floride at night, and use my Tom's in the morning.  Really, I am pretty sure that I am procrastinating right now.  Sitting in the library and listening to the sound of thinking, I am merely pausing between work.  I should get out my list.  See what sort of work I really have on my plate.    Spring. Goats with matted hair standing in a field eating on grass that is the undenignable color of birth and contemplating the time when they would be crawling and leaping in craggy wind swept summer peaks where hikers do not go and marmots fear to tread.  In thawing ground in a corner of the granite cliff there is a patch of earth licked into life by hot light and within is a plant that is waiting and it will sprout up and be mistaken for a purple ruby hiding and sparkling some dawn by a passing child who is riding silent in a backpack, parents unaware that she has spotted god.   Hidden by the boards in my back yard there are baby mice wrapped warm in moist leaves and they are dreaming about the faint smell of dried berries that are hanging above them in unclaimed clumps and are listening to their parents whisper about the one who went into our house last night and didn't come back because of the traps that were set, and the new brood will be smarter and faster and more cunning then the last, and nature will take back the stolen fields that once lived here.  In the dawn light that I am waking to more and more there will be a calling, until soon I will open the window and let it fill my wanderings with toys of light and dreams of snakes and when I open my eyes they will be met with a cool air that promises to be 100 degrees by ten and I will smile and uncurl from my shorter hibernation and think about the half woven meaning that sits piled under my eyelids, and glance at my old brown alarm clock with red symbols of time and be amazed, because it is two hours before the alarm would even think of threatening, but it feels like I have slept for a thousand years and I will get up and go deer alert into the day.
