My teeth starts to chatter badly the moment I enter audi. I have unusual aches everywhere. Oopps... hope it's nothing serious... I still wanna live a longer life. haha... Anyway, I love the weather today. Although it's a little freezy and you can feel the coldness penetrating into your skin like a thousand needles... this scenario reminds me of the time when I was in Hong Kong. hai~ gone are the days... when will the holidays be coming again? Hopefully this time I can travel to a Western country? Maybe for sight seeing and even for a shopping spree! That would be an extremely GrEaT idea yah...  Anyway... talking about co practice... I think I'm looking forward to it. Because of the Matsuri piece, I'm finally 'falling in luv' with my zhongruan. haha... I miss those percussion beats that I used to play on my kulintang (malay xylophone) when I was in Angklung Band. I miss lots of people... all my juniors, my instructor and surprisingly even the PFA(Performing Arts)Department. Felt really touched when I attended "Arts Alive" the other time. I just wanna say... you guys really rock to the max. and I'm truly proud to be an ex-senior of AB. Great music! Wonderful showmanship! it's really a tremendous improvement... and I really hope that they will continue to uphold the excellent reputation of AB. Hmn... but I think that there's 1 thing that's lacking in AB... and that's unity. Some of the members lack the positive attitude... hopefully under the guidance of the next batch of leaders... we will be able to see some improvements. Honestly, I do not have much faith in the next batch of leaders... so let time prove their capabilities. Perhaps, when one is appointed a leadership position... that person will learn to mature gradually and eventually is able to handle all the responsibilities in hand.  Hmn... I've lots of expectations for the next batch of AB leaders. Perhaps it's due to my perfectionist nature again, that may give others some pressure at times. hahahahaha!~  Okay... that's all...hope that I'll feel much better tomorrow... or else... *_*
