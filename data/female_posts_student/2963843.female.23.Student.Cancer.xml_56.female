We didn't even have time to rehearse for our presentation.. I'm glad everything went well...  I had to borrow formal clothing and shoes from my project mates! hehe.. it was funny wearing another person's clothes. But I think she chose a great outfit for me.. I was expecting they might choose something they hate for me.. haha.. Know that there are no true friends in SIM Each for his or her own.. I'm pretty fine with that actually.. Helps me prepare for the harsh working world in the future  It was hard having to finish everything within a night... But our presentation went quite well except for a few glitches... hehez... The lecturer liked my flash animation! SHe complimented that it was creative.. hehez... All the hardwork didn't go down the drain...  I just plopped onto my bed and slept for about 2 hours... Ah.. I miss my dear bed!  Its over! All the toiling is over! Bintan! 6 more days! Here I come!  =)
