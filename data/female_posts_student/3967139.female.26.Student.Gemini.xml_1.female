There are so many things I miss about Oregon; my friends, trees, real mountains, rain, people who know how to drive, no sales tax, someone to pump my gas, Wog & Fi. I’m not even to my final destination and I already can’t wait to see the girls in October. I’m so lucky to have such wonderful supportive friends and family. I know that I couldn’t do this without them all.
