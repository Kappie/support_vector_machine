No one looks at me I taste fear I can’t find myself Strange voices I hear  Surrounding Don’t understand a word Surrounding I try to run away, but… There’s no escape. I’m shapeless Like floating in thin air Though,  Heavy feelings bring me down To the ground Like a glass I break in thousand pieces Careful! You might cut yourself in me  It hurts this loss It hurts this meaningless It hurts this loneliness It hurts this bad love It hurts!
