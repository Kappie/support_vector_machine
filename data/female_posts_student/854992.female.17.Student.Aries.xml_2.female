Maybe I'll be a lawyer    or activist        or a business woman            always  busy-busy-busy or maybe... I'll be all of my deepest desires and darkest secrets and secret admirers and forgotten keepers. But then again if I promise now to be something somewhere someday...maybe I'll be signing my life, my freedom, my everything to chains in dungeons    where it's cold       under         the ground. 6 ft.
