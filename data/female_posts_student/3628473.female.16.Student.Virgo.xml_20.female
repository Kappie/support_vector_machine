Not cause of which boy, and not cause its un-pure thoughts. but thats not what my life is about. I'm not living for a boy. I'm living for God... Yet my thoughts aren't on that. Well, unless you count having a "godly" relationship with this young man. Which i have been thinking about.... But i called him last night. It took me an hour to get the nerve up to call him. But did... And he was happy to hear from me. I was sooo on nerves that i didn't know what to talk about. so i let him do all the talking. Which was wonderful, i loved listening to him. but why are my thoughts on that? Every time i have a free moment to myself, i think about seeing him. Or going out and doing something with him. On a date... And so on.... Its not the fact that i hate it. i dont mind thinking about this young man. But is it wrong? Its not unpure. Man i should limit the thoughts times down. But its hard. I like thinking about him. I love talking to him. He is the reason i get on now-a-days. And if we dont talk, i feel bummed out. This is what you call a crush, right? But it didn't start out that way. I just loved talking to him cause we both had the same insights on a few things. Cause he was a God seeking man, and i was a God fearing woman. But now its different. Before, i could handle not talking to him. I didn't wait everyday just to talk to him. but now i do.... He is still God seeking, fearing, loving, and sooo much more. And i am still God fearing. I guess i think its so silly cause its so out of reach. And i mean really... Its out of reach. But i want to have faith. That if its in Gods blue prints for my life, then it will happen. I really do hope it is though... I really really REALLY want that person to be in the blue prints...
