So I couldn't make it. So now I feel bad. And why shouldn't she be mad? I shouldn't have signed up if I didn't know about rides. Man I feel horrible... She didn't even talk to me this morning...  What am I going to do?  Something that has been on my mind lately is college... And I have my eyes on CCU... Which is  kind of funny. Cause I don't want to be a consoler, but that's what this school dose. I don't know. We will see what else pops up...
