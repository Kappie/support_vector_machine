I am going to do this. It kinda sucks, because I know I will miss him. It has been five years. But the last year has really sucked ass.  Reasons for leaving...  1. Works 7 days a week, all day and all night, and some how we are not rich. ( A little suspicious)  2. My Birthday sucked ass because of him, ON my birthday, he couldn't hang out with me because he had softball. and on my birthday weekend party, where all my friends, were going to get together for my birthday carl wouldn't go because he had to work, but would let me drink for free at his bar.  3. Secret life, Carl has a tendency to leave out things that he does through out the day. Even if they are work realted, he never mentions anything.( I have to listen to his voicemail messages just to know what is going on with his life)  4. Something is always happening. Somehow on his way of way to somewhere Carl always runs into someone, something. That always delays him, Hence, can never commit to anything because of this.  5. Neglect, This is the big one. When Carl is not working 7 days a week, During the fall he must go hunting from Friday after work untill Sunday night from September to January. Anytime I want him to be with me It is like pulling teeth, because there is always something else to do besides me. This August 27th is Bear Hunting season in Maine. Carl has never taken me anywhere nice for vacation(we went to Vegas once, but that trip was on his dad) I have asked him not to go, but he claims that he would rather spend time with his brothers. And he never gets to do anything for himself, which is true, but he never gets to do anything with me either.  6. Carl and I don't even sleep together sometimes, we will go in spurts of months not sleeping together, he falls asleep on the couch. ( I do not miss him either)  7. He never surprises, I know that this is a girly theory, but I really beleive that if I were to get a hello phone call of just a simple I love you phone call everything wouldn't feel so empty all the time. Plus I can predict everything he does and how situations will end. Usually me getting hurt.  If Carl fucks up on something instead of comming home right away he just figures hey I already fucked so what is the use of trying Since I know this is how he thinks, hence never surprised.  8.Cheated on me. About two years ago he kissed some girland was talking with her behind my back for like a month. Which at his time we were engaged and put deposits down on a reception hall, making up guest list, picking out wedding party people. During this whole time, yup talking to another girl. (During this time it was my birthday, and on my birthday called other girl before he even called me to wish me a happy birthday, I checked the cell phone bills)As much as he did apologize and crawl up my ass for it, I have never forgiven him for it.I always check all his calls, voicemails ,mail. Time of arrival and departure where ever he goes. And to tell you the truth I am exhausted. This is something that I know I won't miss.   9. He likes to throw money at me. Anytime he does something wrong, which is a lot of times. He often gives me money to make me feel better and buy myself something nice. Then when i get upset for whatever reason he says" Well, I gave you money for ......"  10. Forgot our five year anniversary. Did not even call me to say hi, or wish me a happy anniversary. I took off and partied in the dells on our anniversary he never said anything about it.  I could go on and on, on all the bull shit he has put me through, but I just don't think I need anymore reassurance from myself anymore. There are so many reasons that are a little more personal that I don't even want to get into it or remeber for that matter.  Thanks Shannon for always listening, I might need you more than ever.  This is most definately the right thing for me to do. So off to dads house I go.
