I'd take the purple convertible and the pink jeep and run 'em into walls...the barbies would fly out.  I thought it was neat.  I didn't quite think of it as being morbid or anything...it was just fun. Odd.  Also I got them ready to have fashion shows and picnics.   I wanna play Hungry Hungry Hippos or Candy Land.  I'm in this sort of weird childlike state of mind.  Probably because my mom recovered some old McDonald's toys from our basement.  Does anyone remember McNugget Buddies?  Those were truly awesome...I had the old 80s ones...and also these neat halloween ones you could change the costumes.  You also got the little Trick or Treat buckets...and then there were those sort of "transformers"...the dinosaurs that turned into cheeseburgers and that sort.  Dude...I seriously miss my childhood.  I reflect on it so often.  I think once people start getting a taste of the cruelty of the real world, they wish they could go back to innocent times...where everything is about hope...security...fun...  It just doesn't make sense to me...that we're considered "children" up until we're 18...and for the rest of our lives we have to be grown-ups.   Am I having some sort of crisis? Knowing that this is my final year of being considered "child" in society's eyes?  Lots of thinking to do...I'm not at rest with this subject. It seems that I am in a constant state of reflection and confusion.
