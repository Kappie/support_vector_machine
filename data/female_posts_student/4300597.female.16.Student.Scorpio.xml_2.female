When one thinks of video games these discordant dings of sound waves come pouring into his/her mind, but it is slightly different for me. A collage of video game sound affects can be as pleasing and comforting to my ears as Bach's Toccata in Fugue. For countless days my brother and I have shared our own special ritual. It is neither educational nor enriching, but my parents permit the act to allow for some time of peace. 	As young children Simon and I bickered constantly, but we always calmed our ferocity and fury when we sat down in front of his original Nintendo player. Hours dragged by as I stared in amazement at Simon's impressive playing skills. Even when he turned the volume all the way down, the rapid clicking of his fingers across the game controller soothed my spirit. Simon sat two feet (at most) from the television screen, and I lay with my head at the foot of his bed only inches behind him. More than a hundred times have I fallen asleep to the persistent beeping and clicking of classic games such as Zelda and Mario.  	I have never asked to join Simon in play, and I never will. He performs while I stay true to my role of spectator; this understanding brings our sibling connection a little tighter. Messing up the system was out of the question for me. The minute I touched the controller a rivalry would form and our peaceful existence would be interrupted. Nothing in the world would make me want to be the cause of that.  	Now that Simon is in college and we see each other less and less, I am very rarely serenaded by the endlessly pleasing melody of video games. Whenever he visits I make a forceful attempt to catch him at a lazy time when he sits in front of a screen and plays away. He still gets bright eyes when he has a new game to show me or a special trick he figured out how to do from a video game magazine. What he doesn't realize is that it    doesn't matter what the game is or what he is doing in it. All that matters is the orchestration of beeping and buzzing that lulls in my memories of yesteryears.
