I updated 17Whatever last night and I intend to update H:TNG tonight. I also plan to update  Circumstances , my original slash story. If you read and like my other stuff, you should check it out on www.fictionpress.com I promise I’m going to update that if not this week then next week for sure. This week I’m just settling back into the other two. Also in the midst of all that, I need to get my own website back online. I have a busy few weeks ahead of me! Hehe. By the way, I boarded a new Harry Potter ship a few months back and plan on writing a story in said ship, so if anyone else likes  Harry/Snape  then please comment, encouragement is well appreciated. Watch this spot.   Reviews 17Whatever   Blackie   -  we’ll try to get it up as soon as possible. I’ll try to encourage Angel to write some tonight. It’ll probably up by the weekend at the latest.  artwork  – glad you liked it, we aim to please. We’ll try not to make you wait to long.  The Shadower  – again I owe you a lot. Without you the story would have probably been forgotten since I had no motivation to write. You provided that, if you would like, I’ll dedicate the next chapter to you.  That’s all for the reviews today, again, the reason I choose to answer them here is it doesn’t clog up the chapters – but I do like to show appreciation to the reviewers. For  17Whatever  though I must point out that Angel doesn’t really read the reviews, so if you would like to hound him for chapters too (which I think is only fair) you can at his hotmail adress - (just mention it's about the story) --  angel_investigations_box@hotmail.com . Thanks again, Akasha xxxxxxx
