I've just went through the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and all I want to do is cry on someones shoulder. I don't want there petty, I don't even want sympathy. I just want a fucking hug that says "Yeah, everything will be fine" OR "Wow, your doing such a great job." But yet that is to damn hard for anyone to do because they think I'm going to fall in to my old bad habits.  How the hell can you do that? Your stomach only holds so much and if you over eat there's a chance you'll be throwing up. My past bad habits shouldn't even be talked about right now. It's over. I choose a new path in my life but yet they can't see that -- WHY????????????   I'll never understand. So instead I sit here wanting to cry even more, it's so werid to deal with stress because there's no eating when your pissed off, lonely, sad, happy, whatever. WHY can't they understand that? WHY?! I mean hell give me some credit for atleast facing the fact that I had a problem and I went through all this to fix it and atleast work through it on my own.   Blah. I just want a hug.
