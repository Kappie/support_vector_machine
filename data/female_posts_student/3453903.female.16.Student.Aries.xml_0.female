I woke up in the middle of the night last night and spent about ten minutes thinking about something before sleep pounced once again and sent me back to sleep. But this morning I could not have said for the life of me what I was thinking about. I know it was something that (to me) was quite interesting. But the content? Forget it.   So that ten minutes of what could have been pure genius are down the pan forever. Shame really. Although, considering my mind's not the most awake of things in the middle of the night (well, 3 o'clock in the morning sort of time) I'm sure it most probably wasn't.
