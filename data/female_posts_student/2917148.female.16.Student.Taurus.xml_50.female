David came over around 10:30 am on tuesday on the bus.. all by himself : ) isnt that adorable... anywho he was a cuddly moofin, yes he was. and we hid in my room for awhile from my dad. we played some nintendo. He so kicked my boo-tay in super smash brothers heh that was fun. Then after my dad left to get movies and food we quickly scatter'd down stairs still being all cuddly ^.^ We watched some tv and ate tacos.. they hurt ma belly o.x lol. We slept in the guest bedroom in the same bed *gasps* lol.. it was nice kinda comforting. Got to bed around 4:30 am and around 1ish pm... all n' all I loved it . Makes me wish parents wernt so pertective about having the opposite sex sleep over eesh well... hmm he left here around... 8:30? im guessing that. I just love him so much ^-^ well imma gonna get going not much else to say.. plus im talking to David! lol i sound obsessed.. maybe I am :]
