I doubt I'll have a chance to get on later today (currently 1am), and our flight leaves at 7 something Sunday morning so we need to leave for Milwaukee by 4, so I won't be getting on then...  My dad said I'll probably be able to use his comp while we're there, so I'll update every once in awhile.  Just to let you all know how much fun I'm having, of course.  Trapped in our timeshare w/ my sister while my dad's at work...  Maybe I'll just walk around and look for hot or semi-hot guys to pass the time.  Make a friend or two to hang out w/ for the week...  Sit on the beach, getting some small amount of sun.  We're going to Universal Studios one day and Epcot another.  YAY!  And the best part of it all is -- NO MOM!!!  Of course, she'll probably have Don over while we're gone, but as long as I don't have to listen to them have sex I just don't care anymore... if my mom wants to fuck some random guy then fine.  Our family is already fucked up as it is, why not make everything worse, right?  I mean, there's no way in hell that they don't know about the drinking, yet they still let me go to Robert's all the time.  I don't really think they care all that much.  I don't think they know about the happy smoke, but maybe, idk.  In 4 months I'll be 18 and I'll do whatever the fuck I want and it won't matter.  Not that I don't already, but... They have nothing to threaten me with.  They aren't going to help me pay for college, so they can't take that away.  If they kick me out I'll just go live in a dumpster or something, visit friends every once in awhile.  I'll be fine.  Life sucks, oh well, you get over it.  A year from now I'll be in a completely different state, far enough away that I won't have to deal with my mom and Don and my dad, and Laina, and Kait, and everything else...    but yeah  this post started off happy then I got ranted and got off on a tangent so I'll stop...
