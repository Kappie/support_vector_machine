Seriously Orlando Bloom cannot act. He should stick to Lord of the Rings where is acting ranges from facial expressions of mildly amused to mildly interested. But this time I had Madeline to make fun of it with. *mini cheer* Johnny Depp is still the sexiest man on the freaking planet. Ok but then we get out of the movies and we are sitting outside on one of those little wall things and Madeline is like spitting ice and stuff, because... why not. And then my neighbor, Chrissie, walks by and is all "hey what's up" and i'm just like. "oh my god who the fuck was that." It took me about three minutes to remember who she was. Sad, I know. Sadder for her really though. Ok then, Madeline, in a fit of ice spittingness drips ice FROM HER MOUTH, all over her crotch. And then to get back at me for laughing so freaking hard she pours the remaining contents of her cup (ice water) on me. Attempting to pour it on my crotch to make people think I pissed myself. She missed and it went all over my leg. It was hilarious. I wasn't even moving or trying to block it or anything. Then we walk across the parking lot to the mall to get a pretzal at rita's. Madeline gets her pretzal and in an attempt to brush the salt off of it she drops it into the trash can. We laughed till we pissed ourselves. Then we get gelatis also at rita's. And then just as we were recovering from the pretzal incident this french guy (french madeline, not spanish, FRENCH) comes up and is like "alo, what are your names? Ow old ah yoo? Yoo ah frens? I see. You (madeline) come ere I weell show yoo somsing. *polishes madeline's thumbnail while we laugh our fucking asses off* Come now be serious ladies *laughs* *speaks incoherently in french accent*" We laughed so much like neither of us could say a word. We should have given him fake names. We could not breathe. I was like fucking pissing myself. amazing.
