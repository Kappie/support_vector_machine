Only 6 more days of lessons.  SWEET!  Word of the day:  ruka - hand/arm.....how can you have only one word for both of those????? It seems a bit counterintuitive to me...if you say "boli mi ruka" it can mean "my hand hurts" or "my arm hurts".  How do you know????? Oh well....I just need the basics....
