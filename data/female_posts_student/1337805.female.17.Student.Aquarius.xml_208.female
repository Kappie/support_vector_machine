It all started with me and greg going over to the Ippens (and seeing Tom's massive bedroom, I'm envious of his monster sized bed..:'( ) and then Mike, me, Tom, dan, Tony, Tom R and Greg all drove down to the Empress to get there at 4 to open the youth room. The room was pretty big, it had a nice TV which we later found out got cable. Katrina and a few other youth arrived, and everyone explored throughout the Empress, riding on the elevators, blah blah, it was a extreme lot fo fun. Alicia and Tsuki arrived around 6-ish and that was awesome, cause I haven't seen Tsuki in a while and I miiiiissed her. I was asked to hold our church banner for the banner parade, and that was actaully a lot of fun. I love banner parades :) I almost misted up when I saw Dymtro and Dan holding our banner, even if it did disapeer for the rest of the weekend. By the time I left at 9.30ish, Samaya still hadn't shown up. Even though I was worried bonkers.  Saturday invovled getting up and getting there at 8.45, fairly early, but Mike hadn't arrived yet and so the room wasn't open. Samaya, Tsuki and Jenna and Laurel arrived during the night, and I said hi to them all in the morning. It was nice to see Samaya, I had missed her. We had a meeting at around 10, and got about half our stuff done before we broke and I had to go upstairs to run my valentine making workshop. Tons of gorgeous valentines were produced, it was awesome. Then we all took off for lunch, and some to play pool at Peacocks. Then me and Laura left to go to my house, then her house, then Sabrina's house, back to the conference center in two hours. It was fun, I enjoyed seeing Sabrina again. :) Then me and Laura stayed, and I walked around with Katherine and Tom in some gorgoeous places in the Empress, it was fun :) Then me and Laura took off for Bead World and the comic book store. We came back and watched Remember the Titans, which is an awesome movie. Then we broke for pizza dinner, and then came back to watch the rest of the movie, which made me cry a little, even though Andrew and Laura were making fun of me. Andrew was hitting on Laura!!! I hope they get married, cause he's cute, and they'd be cute together. Then we ran downstairs and the gropu soooorta planned out worship, and me and Tsuki left, not knowing how horrible it would be when we got back. It was worrysome.  The meeting was pretty fun, but we only had two hours, 30 mins were taken up by checkin, another 30 by some random guy talking about PNWD affairs that we didn't really care about, and thank gosh, Kyle spoke up and the guy left. We accomplished a lot in our remaining hour, and I sprung on the YAC ten minutes before worship that they were helping with it. I went down to worship a few minutes later and saw this gorgeous transformed theater. The group had organzied everything so excellently, where to have everyone to sit, an improvised chalice, it made me tear up. Even if there were only 28 people for worship, it was still pretty radical. I ran around afterwards giving everyone hugs and thanking them. Eli (who, btw, is super cute along with Rob and Andrew) gave me a super deep speicial hug too, that just calmed me down and relaxed me. Then I ran back upstairs with Eli and Rob to our meeting and finished it up in just 15 minutes. It was beautiful. We headed back to the conference center to be blasted by music, and I ran up to join in with everyone to dance, because the youth got it going again (which was AWESOME!!) There was a slow song, and me and Laura attacked Tom, and we three-way danced that song, and it was soooo good! Tom is such a clown, I can't remember when it was when I had laughed so much. Then Samaya and Tsuki and Jenna were leaving, and somehow the topic of Tom (like at our last meeting...ullg.) was brought up again, and Samaya said that we would make a cute couple, and that we should go out, and I said..uhh.. and then just before she left she said that he would make a great husband for me and she would be sad if we didn't get married....Tom'll have fun at Seabeck this year, I can tell you that.  We danced more and more until like, midnight, and then the youth disappeered when it was time to leave and me and Tom freaked out at them when they returned, cause it was dumb of them.  Overall, the weekend was a complete and utter success, I'm so impressed, I'm throwing our youth a party for all they did, even though Samaya insists that it was all me and Mike, and mostly me who pulled this weekend off. (I love Sam so much when she makes me feel pretty :) ) I still want to though, the youth did a fantastic job. And I'm contemplating telling Tom about our forseen future..oO. Right. Anyways, I'm out. I'm so exhausted. And I'm trying to remember what Mike and I were discussing when we needed the Y-FUUD grant..>
