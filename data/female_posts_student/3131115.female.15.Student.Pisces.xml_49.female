This morning, I looked down and saw a picture of the two of us holding zachary, and it made me happy. So happy that I started to cry. Bill and I have our problems, and we're often mean to eachother..but that means nothing. Relationships aren't easy. I get annoyed when we fight..but I'm glad that we do. It only makes us understand eachother better. So instead of dreading them, I will welcome them. I'm not saying that I want the two of us to fight, but when the time comes I will not be angry. I now believe that nothing at all could ever be a threat to our relationship. I am in love, and I plan on spending the rest of my life with him and having his children. I dont think that anyone could every make me as truly happy as he has. Somebody may make me happy for a few hours at a time, but in the long run, I find myself wanting to be with bill rather than others. I'm always worried about my friends, like "oh no, I dont have any friends"..but at the end of all this and after school none of my friends will be there, but he will. William is there for me no matter what, and I am there for him. No matter what happens..or how mad we are at eachother..We will always be there for eachother. I'm hoping that it will stay this way for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt that it will.
