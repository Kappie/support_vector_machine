Even though I don't think anyone does.*winks*)       Digital Camera (3.2 MP and up)  Gameboy Advance SP  Earrings  Funky Pens/Pencils  Eaglestrike (book)  Graviation DVD set  Memory Card for the N64  Escaflowne Soundtrack  Postcards (which I collect)  Pins (Also collect. It's a big thing with the long-term exchangers as well.)      Hmm, I think that's all for now. Just spoke briefly with Maju on IM. I was describing the snow situation to her. She said it was cold in Brazil. But, being the selfish person I am, I forgot to ask her how cold it was there. ^_^
