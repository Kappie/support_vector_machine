My mom used to work with extraordinarily  prominent  women when she lived in the Philippines about sixteen years ago.  These women have kept in touch with her over the years, even with the Pacific Ocean between them ( literally ).  So now that these ladies have retired, and with much money at that, they have decided to come here to  America  for the first time.  Naturally, my mom and I are their primary hosts, as they do not wish to travel all the way to New York to be shown around by their very own relatives.  They are due to arrive at LAX  tomorrow , when we will pick them up.  Over the course of the next two  weeks , we will escort our guests to many well renowned places such as Disneyland, Catalina, and Universal Studios.  Tonight I will be attending a preliminary potluck meeting for my church's annual Children's Beach Camp.  There, we will discuss the following events:   Vintage Car Show/Mini Carnival (beach camp fundraiser) ~  Sunday July 18, after church in the parking lot.   Actual Beach Camp ~  only 2 days...Saturday and Sunday August 7-8 at Mother's Beach.   I have yet to decide what I will be bringing as my potluck dish.  Perhaps some  eggrolls   .
