I hate everything about you why do i love you  I hate everything about you  why do i love you   everytime we lie awake after every hit we take every feeling that i get but i  haven't  missed you yet  only when I stop to think about it ...    I hate everything about you why do i love you   I hate everything about you   why do i love you    only when i stop to think   about you, I know  only when you stop to think about me, do you know   I hate  everything about  you    why do I love you   you hate everything about me   why do you love me    I hate you hate I hate  you love me    I hate everything about you why do I love you      Lyrics Provided By :  urlLink Rocklist      ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
