Then Ryan went in there like 20 min. later and the manager told him the same thing! The mamager also told me to come back tomarrow and talk with the MAIN MAN! hehe!! I cant wait!   I asked my mom if I could eat at Ryans house and she said if I get a job then I could. When I told her what happend at Baskin Robins she said I could stay and eat. So me and Ryan hung out. When he was cleaning his room I was throwing things at him. He was gettng so mad but it was so cute!   Then Eka called me and told me I had an interview with Justice. It is this little girls clothing store owned by the Limited Too. I am soo excited!  Then me and Ryan had to go to some yard work in his moms garden so we were out there for a lil while. Then I had to leave! :(   So wish me luck on my interviews tomarrow!
