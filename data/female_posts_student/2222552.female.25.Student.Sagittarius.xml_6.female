It seems nobody wants me to better my life, and everything is more important like napping or grocery shopping.  #2 its almost the may long weekend and I have nothing to do... I have a family cottage I should be going to but my parents said I'm not welcome instead they are allowing my ex who is harassing and stalking me and his dirty tramp of a girlfriend go (this girl is trying to sleep with all the guys in this group of friends she has got 2 already from what I hear)... These people have called children's aid trying to get my daughter removed from my custody, they prank call me, they put my name and phone number in the local news paper, they have me charged with false allegations, break into my place, and sit in a car in my building parking lot for hours waiting for me to get home. This is only the big stuff there are tons of minor things these losers have done.  I wish I had a nice supportive family
