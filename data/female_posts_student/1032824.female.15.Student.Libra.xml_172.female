Today is our school's annual Sports Meet and although we were supposed to be given the morning off to celebrate our school's outstanding O level results, we were made to go to school for Humanities and Physics lessons. I think the teachers sacrficed a lot of time to prepare their lessons, so thank you, Mrs Tan and Miss Low! * Huggles! * So this morning at 8am, Fiona came up with a brilliant idea, to fool Miss Shelley Low cos it's April fools day! Hehe.. Oh my gosh, it was hilarious! We all hid in the  Band  Choir store room while Fiona told Miss Low that nobody was present because someone posted a message at AsknLearn informing us about the cancellation of Miss Low's lesson. Miss Low's reaction was so incredibly funny, I think she got a lil' mad at first, and went hysterical later! She almost wacked Fiona with her TV antennae!! Hohoho! Everyone broke into peals of laughter after that. Thanks to Fiona for starting my day with so much giggles!   Mrs Tan Bee Bee is really nice today as well. She let us off at 11.15am instead of 12noon, so we all headed for lunch at KFC before going to the stadium. Bought heaps of snacks and we had a little picnic, eating chocolate ice cream which Geets had bought! * YUMMY * What a sin though! Haha! Most of our teachers came over to sit with us at the stadium. *Teehee. Mr Lee looked so adorable in the class tee, it was silly of him to wear it over his polo shirt though. Haha! We settled the extra class tees thingy (finally) and took some photos, which can be found at Siti's blog. I like the class photos, it's so cute with our teachers in them! Man.. it sure was exhilarating! The 4X100m race was postponed (according to Amelia) due to the weather, which I thought was a waste because I had a feeling that we might be able to win today. Hehe. I'm happy, I'm also exhausted! Thanks to everyone who made this such an unforgetable event. I think Fiona is the happiest today though! Haha! Because she got to talk and play with Miss Low! Hehehe. Fiona's such a silly nutto. I love her to bits!   Martini is a pain in the ass. Haha! Just kidding. He sent me the same testimonial 7 times. And he sent me an April Fools Day joke via sms. So not funny! Make me panic only. -.-" Hafiz intro-ed a song to me by D12. Quite nice, it sounds so cute man. Hoho. Nana, if you're reading this, cheer up and kick some ass! To the class committee members, you guys rock me and my peanut butter! Siti, thanks for posting up the pics! :D  [4B1'04!] Rocks!   I'm going to end with a quote by Doc Childre,  "The more care you put into your life, the more life will care for you, bringing you fun adventures, great friends, and real inner security. Caring is just good streetsense â€” So, Judge less and unstress, Care more and high score."   Toodles and rock on kids!
