Me: no Old Lady: then why are you here? Me: I'm involved in a court case Old Lady: really? Me: yes, i stole a car Old Lady: *nervous laugh* oh, it that so? Me: ya Old Lady: so how old are you? Me: 14, so hopefully i'll only get juvi Old Lady: oh *walks away in a nervous fluster* it was so funny, she deserved it too, nosy. i am in such a shitty mood. plus jenna can't come to my party. i hate my life. it sucks. well, i love my family and freinds so i'm glad i was born to meet them. i hate him. so very much. he has stained my (crappy) life.
