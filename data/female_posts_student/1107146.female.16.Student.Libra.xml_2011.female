Judging as that my vocabulary has expanded far and beyond the standard impositions place upon more plebian (for nonessence of a more fitting vocabularial choice) minds, I should procure no trouble in engaging my pedagogical endeavours with due vehemence and lack of the irksomeness commonly associated with delving one's mind for a word more befitting of such a "holier than thou" sentence as the very one you are perusing.  And I already know how to get beer, call collect, and get crepe-paper stains out of PJs. College is going to blow. Thank god for the beer to make the monotony die a black death.  Sigh...Purity Iced Tea gives such drawn-out, worthless thoughts to life and consideration.
