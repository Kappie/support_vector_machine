I mean, my friends are all in computer, and i amd here doing absolutely nothing, and i won't until 1245 because thats when they get out. have i already said this? i can't remember. i'm too tired. there is so much work to do, and i don't think that there is humanly enough time to have fun AND do all my work. i guess that means that i actually have to try hard now, to get good grades, finally. I'm sick of getting lousy grades, and i'm sick of forgetting to take my medicine so i can't concentrate in class. i don't know, i guess my life is just full of laziness. i have all this time sometimes, and i never use it, and then when i get all these hard things to do, i have such a busy scheduale, and i wish that i had done my work when i had the chance. oh well, i guess i'd better get going. there is only ten minutes left, so i'm sure i can think of something to do before i work, right? Ok, so maybe i'll stay on and right, for those really really really few viewers who read this. i don't know if i should get my hair cut today, or with my friend on saturday. if i did get my hair cut with my friend, i would need money for that AND shopping for a top, but i already have 20 dollars, so that can't be too much. and if when i DO get my hair cut, should i just trim it, or should i get layers? and if i get layers, should i get normal layers, movie star layers, or sexylayers? hmm? there are just too many options. and if i did get to go to my friends house on Friday to saturday, should i stay up really late playing sims, or should i get my beauty sleep? sims! anyway... maybe i should type slower, because i've typed all of this and i still have 6 minutes to waste! darn it! oh well. maybe i'll just go visit with jessica and sandra.
