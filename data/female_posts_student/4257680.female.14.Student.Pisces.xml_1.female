Every day I wonder why god has blessed me with such an awesome gift and why, why you chose me I will never understand. What is it that you see in me? How can it be that you see me perfectly and I see nothing near perfect? How can it be that out of all the beautiful gorgeous girls out there, you chose me? But I've come to realize that I sould not be questioning why but thatnking god that you did in the first place. So now I say thank you, thank you for choosing me.
