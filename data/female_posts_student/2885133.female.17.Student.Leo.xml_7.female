So I was working on assays (DNA activity) so I had a rack containing 24 DNA combinations lined up on them. After I was done gathering the data, I moved the rack, my lab notes to the lab station. They were all there when I left to edit the data and make charts. It was still there when I returned twenty minutes later to record the day's work in the lab notebook and to clean up my mess. In the five minutes between me dumping the samples in the trash and putting away another set of DNA, the rack was GONE! It went *poof* and disappeared leaving me to rant like a lunatic because that was the only rack that was christened as mine, and I use it everyday! In shorter time for me to notice my disappearing rack, my mother decided to let me get a different rack from her stash of lab equipment... Guess what? I found my rack nicely stacked in the back.  So the mystery remains... Who took my rack or who was the unfortunate nice person who put away my stuff before I got to take care of it?     Quick comments about lab stuff:   There gloves should adjust for people with strange thumbs. The between the thumb and index finger should be made closer to the wrist so the tips of the gloves don't get caught when snapping the lid of a tube shut.  If a hazardous waste bucket is getting old, people should replace it before it actually cracks and floods the vacuum hood with the hazardous waste.  Trash should be emptied at least once every two weeks... Decomposing pipette tips are so gross.
