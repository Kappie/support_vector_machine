I was so aggravated and...I just eneded up ending it early because I was  so frustrated. I talked to Erica and Peter for a bit afterward and then came  home. They cheered me up a bit, definitely.   Then, yesterday was Six  Flags of course. That was a ton of fun. On the way to Diane's house, Alex pulled  into a driveway to turn around, but it was on Wherli and the street was super  busy and you couldn't really see. the cars from the drivers seat, so Matthew was  telling him when to go and stuff and when we finally almost went, Matthew goes,  "Go after this SUV...no, not this one, this one. FU**IN' GO NAVSKI!!!"    Ah, it toally made my day and it was only 7:45 in the morning. W  etotally peeled backward out of the driveway.   Six Flags was awesome too  of course. We got on all the rides we wanted to. It wasn't nwarly as crowded as  last time. I didn't feel very well for part of the day, but it was fine.    Then, in the line for Raging Bull (the first time) Alex found this ring  on the ground and Matthew was like, "oh, give it to me." And...he proposed to  me. Haha. So, now I'm engaged. Good times. My engagement ring is a nice elastic  five dollar ring. At least it's not from a cracker jack box. :)   And, oh  gosh. I've never loved teacups as much as I did yesterday. It was amazing.  Matthew and Alex spun us SO super fast. It was insane. "the g forces!!!!! I feel  like I'm having a baby!!!!"   Haha. Fun, FUN times. And of course, we went  on Raging Bull as the last part of the day. That's becoming tradition. Last ride  of the day, front row. It was awesome. Matthew brought a pretzel up. Haha. It  was crazy, when we started to go down, he held it out and it like...hovered for  a second or two and then flew up and off. It was crazy.   Then, unfortunately comes the worst part of the day. On our way out, there were a few lanes of traffic leaving and then one lane for incoming traffic. Well, there was a car going through the incoming traffic and, of course it was going faster than the rest because there wasn't nearly as much incoming traffic. Well, we all heard this big boom. We seriously thought it was a fender bender. And, we heard all these people screaming and yelling, and we didn't understand at first, but as we got farther up, we saw that it wasn't another car that the first car hit. It was a person or people. We weren't sure how many people the car hit. At least seven police cars came, two ambulances, and a fire truck. I just...couldn't believe that a car hitting a person could make a sound like that. It just wont get out of my head. I just keep hearing it. It sounded like when the guy rear ended me a few weeks ago. That's not a sound a car should make when hitting a person. I'm looking around in the newspapers trying to find information about it, but I've been unsuccessful so far.   It was just....such a shock. None of us knew what  to do. We wanted to help somehow, but we knew we couldn't. We went to Steak 'N  Shake, but I wasn't really all that hungry after that.   So, I said a  prayer for all the people involved. It's just that sound keeps reverberating in  my head. And, as we were driving by, the sound of that woman screaming and  crying, "I was going so slow, I was going so slow!!!"   It honestly just  brings me to tears.   But, life must go on. I feel bad for going on with  my life when someone else may have died. It's just an awful thought. I guess I  have to though. I mean, it does no good for me to sit and dwell about it. All I  can do is pray for all parties involved.   Today, I went and...well, I was  a rebel. Diane knows what I'm talking about. :) It actually wasn't bad at all.  I'm happy.   And, I talked to Carson FINALLY! :) It was super. She told me  about an old jr. high teacher that's being investigated for sexual harassment of  some sort I guess. I'm not surprised. She was even questioned. I might be too.  I'm scared. the one time I was questioned by a police officer scared the heck  out of me, but I was only in sixth grade. I'm sure I could handle being  questioned by the superintendant...TP. It's just weird to think that he's  finally being investigated. We all kind of thought he was creepy, but...yeah.  It's sscary to think it's actually happening now.   Well, I've written  enough for now, and I need to go out with friends...or something. I need some  fun :) Woo. Later days.
