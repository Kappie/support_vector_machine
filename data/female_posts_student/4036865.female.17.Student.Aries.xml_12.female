We'll just see. i feel at peace with myself today, i feel happy, yes, it is quite a wonderful feeling, been a long time i've felt so content. i wish i was a bit older, i would like to go clubbing, i want to dance, i want to express myself, perhaps i will paint this evening, i just love working with watercolors. i think more then dancing i want to sing thou, i wish i hadnt quit my lessons, i was getting better and better, its a gift, i should use it. He plays the guitar, perhaps i can convince him to play something if i sing. i'm shy about singing for other people. i feel modest about it, everyone says im really good, but You can't really hear what You sound like to other people, so its hard to say. We'll just have to see. Kyle comes home tonight, i'm feeling nervous about that, pretty anxious thou, i wish i could just get it over with. i played with his lizard, Dino, as i have dubbed him, i took him out and everything, he likes me, he didnt try to bite, his tummy feels funny, and he's claws feel like pins and needles like when You limb is waking up again. He's so adorable thou, i like him, i am going to read up on how to take care of them etc. Hey, Kyle is giving him away, i think i am going to take him, shout out to Damon, wanna help me build a new home for him? Well, i think thats about it for today. michelle
