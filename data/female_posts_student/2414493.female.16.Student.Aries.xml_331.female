Maybe this is contributing to my fatigue: five minutes before 9 this morning I scrawled a hasty "I can't go to breakfast message" and taped it to the guys' door. Jenn came in at a bit past 10 and handed me a blueberry muffin, yay. To that stash, we've added a brownie and a sugar cookie. It's too hot to be hungry, though. I almost fell asleep in Lamont and decided to go to Starbucks for coffee to keep me up, but I fell asleep again when I got back to the dorms.  The anthro midterm is tomorrow. I'm reading the article on slash and burn again, though I don't know how much of all these minute details I'll have to know for the test. It's a few ID questions, one short essay and one long essay--how bad could it be? But then again, essays are only good when they have a lot of fact backing up a claim. The positivist approach. I just want to prove myself somehow and show the professor that yes, I have a brain and yes, I can use it. So I'll go back reading. There's that one religion article that never sticks in my head...and I think I'll go flipping through the notes and  Highland Burma , just to be sure.  I suppose the most difficult part about classes and actual work in those classes is that one, you don't know what the teachers expect of you and that two, they don't know what you're capable of. So on your end, you're left guessing at what the test will be like, and on theirs, they'll think you're absolutely mediocre (or worse) until you come up with something brilliant. This isn't high school anymore.  I have whole bunch of clothes piled on top of my dresser...perhaps it'll be wise to clean it off? I also share the bed with a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, and a few random shirts. It's just like back home, except the bed is smaller so I can feel the foreign objects more keenly.   I just might be tired of Death Cab, but I have nothing else to replace it. I found a Tower Records on the other side of The Garage, so maybe I'll go visit sometime. Any suggestions? Is Modest Mouse any good? Or the other Death Cab CD's?
