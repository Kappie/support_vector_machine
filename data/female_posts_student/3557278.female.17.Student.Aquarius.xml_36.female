I have not posted in this thing for like 200 years! Well, since monday anyway! I've just been sooo snowed under with school work and 100 other things. but the good news is that on monday i can hand in my PIP and forget about it! That is, forget about it until i recieve an award for it being so excellent. HAHA please note i am NOT being serious.      Anyway i spose today was alright, and i was actually PRODUCTIVE in maths *gasp*! Its nice and sunny too :) I'm going for a drive too at 3:30... once again i havent been in about a week -- damn being busy. I really don't have much to report, things are going ok, ive been a bit stressed out lately but we are going to the football tomorrow to see the Eels vs. Tigers. I REALLY hope we win.... but i will not get my hopes up :P Poor Parra :(.       Ok i just told Jen i was hungry and realised how often i say that.      Anyway i better get going, i wanna finish my stupid pip reference list before my lesson. ha.      seeyoubye
