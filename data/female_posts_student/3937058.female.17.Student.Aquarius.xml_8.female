Newho we did a sitcom opening and it is, if I do say so myself (I'm sure my group will agree)...LEDG! There are some bit of fabulous hilarity, and wetness (not including matt's scene)and ultimate pain (cheers jess 4 that ball in the face!) So check it out 2moro at the showing in Worthing! Looking forward 2 seein every1 elses 2, fun fun fun. Well, I would go watch some TV but it sucks 2day so I will just write some more lol. Ok, so, earlier I had a driving lesson planned for 5.15... but she didn't turn up I waited 35mins b4 I text her and she was like "Oh sorry, I thought u got my text, I had to cancel" Damn it!! It was trés trés annoying! Anyways à bientot and C u tomorro! xxx
