I don't know why I have been feeling so crappy but mom made an appointment for the doctor so I should find out tomorrow.   Been trying out some of the writing exercises in the class manual  I gotta say- they are kinda fun. The one I did most recently was "Write about a rock". You might think that sounds really boring but it isn't. I sat there, thinking about how a rock would feel, and then I wrote it down. Simple stuff right?? Too bad my english is so terrible, if my english had been better it might actually have been good! Well, I am going to blog it for storage puposes so here goes:     What it Feels like to be a Rock.     By: Meghan   For many years people have passed by me, wondering why I sat alone on this soft, grassless dirt. There is no other sign of life between the place where these people come from, and the place that they are going. Some of the passerbys stop to get a good look at my dented appearence and grey complextion. Only in their imagination can they see the life that I have lived and the people that have passed by me.   To the untrained soul I have lived no life. "A rock has no being," they say to themselves. What the viewers really see is a reflection of their own lives. When one looks at a rock, a rush of thoughts comes towards them. Inside their heads an image comes to life and they associate me (the rock) with that image.   I can hear the thoughts that race through the minds of the people that pass by. To one I may represent strength, and to another I may represent peace. The life that I live is not full of colors or movement, but of silent meditation and unsurpassible understanding. One downside may be that I cannot express my feelings or emotions.   When a hard rain falls like bullets from above, I feel cold. As the thunder and the lightning compete for the sky, I become scared. Shining through the night I see the moon and I am happy. Suddenly, everything stops, and I do not feel the life that once seeped through my weather-worn cracks. I am alone.  Shining like diamonds on a black velvet curtain, I count the millions of stars on their stage. If I made the same wish on each and every star maybe, just maybe, it might come true. I would wish for color like a rainbow and movement like a gazelle. In their immense pity for me, one star may grant my wish. O, how extatic I would be! To live like the people that pass by would certainly make me happy. Wouldn't it? Perhaps the real question was whether or not I wanted to be like those people that pass by me each day.  Sitting on the soft, grassless dirt I thought about the people I had seen walking past me earlier that day. A thought that had never occured to me before popped into my head and refused to leave. "They are all the same." my inner voice tells me, "You are a rock and should be proud to have a title as such." I was different, I was unique, I was a rock. In my serene understanding silence I watched as a little girl walked by with her mother. "Mommy!" the little girl shouted, "Look at that rock!" The girl's mother scolds her gently to calm her down. "Honey, we musn't scream unless things frighten us." the mother says. The little girl looks shamefully up at her mother and trys to explain, "But mommy, that rock   smiled  at me!" A look of astonishment came over the mother's face as she turned to examine me. Once she was quite sure that I was not smiling, she turned back to her young child and said, "That's very silly, sweetie, because rocks cannot smile." Dismayed and in doubt, the little girl turns to look at me once more. I tryed to smile with all my might, but did not know if she could see. Confidently the little girl turned back to her mother and said simply, "He smiles when I smile."   So it doesn't quite bring you to tears  Thanks ok, it's just my first try. I hope to get better soon. Creative writing is something I never thought I would enjoy until I sat in on the saturday writing class. Who knows? Maybe I'll get good at it some day.    Peace out to my buddy Rock.
