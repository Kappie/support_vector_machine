I was looking for WHS letterhead when I decided to go through my old hatbox of letters and little notes that I decided to keep. Found notes from over the summer: a letter from T and J and Q on their way to an ASG retreat, half an email from N when I was still so blind, about the one thing he wanted so badly, little off-color jokes. And a Christmas card from A years and years ago. Sometimes I wonder how he is. He probably has the jerk in him still, but maybe he's softened up? "Enclosed is the program..." One of these days, I'll wonder if I was the ultimate jerk. But it was sixth grade. I don't think I really did anything right back then.  After thorough self-analysis, I've been a party pooper lately. I don't know, what's the best side of me? It's certainly not coming out. Ideally, I'd talk, for one. Even that is an obstacle--what should I tell you about myself? Do I have anything grand to confess? Well, I saw Butch from radiology three times today at the hospital, but one person would find that funny. And P hid "Powerade" in his pants as he was heading out. Thank god for elastic (?) I've never noticed so much that I want to be alone. And it's not even technically alone; it's thinking so hard that you don't notice that you're the only one there, like when you're driving and you're concentrating on the lines on the road.  S's birthday in two days--and I thought I saw him (as crazy as it was) heading into the side door of the emergency room today. He had the tousled brown hair, the tan, the faded polo, the cargo shorts and the flip flops. AH. I could have sworn that if he turned around with the sunglasses and the grin (enhanced by Carmex) I would have believed it all.  Aaaah, NHS form signatures.  I'm not intrinsically mean, but I just don't know what to do now. At the time, I could have honestly spouted off a lot of things, but now? It was an awfully reasonable letter. But that's also preying on the fact that I forget too easily. And is it just because of the quartet issue? She called me arrogant and stuck-up and a whole bunch of other things in between. She thought it was funny to gang up on me and just make fun of me. She did things for "reaction," for emotional hurt. And now?  And I've changed a lot since then, too. This was probably the one issue that messed up two connections. T perhaps might be ok again, but R? I'm glad I realized back then that I was an idiot, and even happier that I can make it along just fine, thank you, without him. I don't know. There was a time when I just felt like I was hanging there because I'd just given up on these things ("you break up with people by cutting them off...") but now I'm so ok with it. And even value-wise. Moral development?  If I could, I would hop in the car now, pop in a CD and drive alone until the gas ran out. I lack some sort of strange peace.
