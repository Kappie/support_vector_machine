I have not lied. But, I did not intend to hurt anyone. I am sorry that I did.  *CTS*  Things are changing again. I woke up at 12:30 this afternoon, I got online, talked a little, got off, packed some clothes for my upcoming 8 day camping trip, and then I started eating "lunch" at like 3:00. As soon as I sat down to eat, Josh came over to give me some things that I'd left at his house. We talked, I showed him the pool, and then he tried to kiss me. (Sigh)... Poor guy didn't want to leave without a kiss. So then, when he left, Mr. Turner called me and told me that practice from 6:30 to 9 o'clock tonight was cancelled. So, I went back in the house and got ready to go out to dinner. We were going to go to the Hong Kong China Buffet in Flint, and then I talked my parents into going to Newport Coney Island in Owosso, where Jake works, but we ended going to Judes China Buffet in Owosso. I didn't talk to Jake all day until 11 o'clock tonight. And even then I only talked to him for less than 10 minutes. But he told me he'd be online. So I get online and send him a message, no response. Like 5 minutes later, Kari signs off and sends me a message: "i g2g", and he signed off. So now I'm sitting here wondering what the Hell I was thinking. I don't know what to say anymore. Shit.
