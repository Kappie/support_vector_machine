I will begin apply for college soon. I'm scared by the fact that I will soon be leaving home, but I'm excited to see what the world has to offer. You never really know until you're on your own. I plan on applying to Hawaii Pacific as my first choice. I still have my doubts about leaving home, but then I think about all the new and creative ways I have to reinvent myself in a new environment. I really do hope I can get into HPU. Well until later in the day, I bid you all farewell.
