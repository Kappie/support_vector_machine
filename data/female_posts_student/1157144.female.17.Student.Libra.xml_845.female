(i.e. in the mornings, Anne hangs out near us and I thought it rude to bring it up in front of her...)  Anyway, my birthday is Next tuesday, and, rather than having a real party, I was thinking we could use it as an excuse for an excursion to San Francisco, since we've all talked about going/have gone numerous times. So here is what I was thinking, and, of course, I need feedback, because I want to know if you have obligations to fulfill, etc.:  I was thinking the Saturday one week from the Homecoming dance, November 8.  As far as times go, I know many people can't/don't want to stay out there the *whole* day, so we could leave early-ish in the morning, sometime between 10-12, and leave at 5 or so.   Again, these matters obvioulsy require feedback, so if you could contribute... please do.   As far as drivers go... well, that is one of those things we must talk about, heh.  I mean, I'm not asking anyone to drive necessarily, but I mean... if you REALLY want my parents to chaperone us around in cars... haha.  If anyone is willing to drive though, that would be a great help, and we could organize the number of people into the least amount of vehicles. (I'm sure my parents wouldn't mind us taking the van [seats 7] for optimum use)  Umm, what else... Oh! Basically, the places people have talked about going in sf include shopping on Haite, Chinatown, and that area with Urban outfitters, FAO shwartz, the Virgin Megastore, etc. etc. Although actually... we should hit up Amoeba, hehe.  Those are just some ideas, so tell me what you're really interested in and whatnot, alright? Allllright.   P.S. Afterwards... my mom and dad have a need to do that whole parental thing with food and whatnot. So we'd probably just... eat here or out, but probably not out since we'll have spent our earnings by then, haha. Well and cake. My mom is obsessed with buying me this one cake for my brithday, so ... you all have to eat it!! haha.   OK SO give me FEEDBACK, hoes!!
