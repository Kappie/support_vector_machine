Being the dumb sensitive fuck face that I am I started crying after I found out my score(which was right before the bell rang at the end of 5th hour) and I headed off to 6th our with tears streaming down my face because the test just pushed me over the edge and I cried about all the dumb things going on in my head right now and my teacher sent me to the counselor. Fuck. That was dumb.  I didn't get to talk to  my  counselor because she was at a meeting, so I talked to another woman who was very...well...I'll just say it was EXTREMELY difficult to say anything to her.  So I'm sitting in her office explaining only a part of why I was crying, and what she told me I had already heard a million times from my mother before so I just knodded in agreement with everything she said and was sent back to class with a note.  I sat in my seat stairing at my desk trying as hard as I could not to cry until school got out.  Fun fucking day for me.  And now I'm sitting here staring at this dumb ass computer trying to figure out why I'm writing any of this and beginning to cry again.  I'm a little upset.  I didn't do my AP chem homework...shit.  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.   oh and yay, I got to go to the doctors office today.  I keep getting this weird sore/infection in the back of my mouth, for a while we thought it might be my molars but then we thought otherwise.  I went to the doctor today and she had no idea what it was and then my doctor called the dentist  and he said if she didn't know he wouldn't know so I'm going to a specialist on Tuesday...I might even get to have a biopsy(sp?) done. Score. I'm going to bed.  Maybe I just need some sleep.
