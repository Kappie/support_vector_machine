But everytime it hits 30:32 it cuts the call, no matter what. And I didn't call back because of how late it was...didn't want your parents to cut your head off or anything.  But it was so incredibly hilarious and random, and I was quite pissed to hear the dead air in the phone when it decided to die....   ...especially from one friend who is being really random... (laugh) Yeah...he.... Hello? Hello?   But o well, you were probably ready to quit anyway, n'est-ce pas? I'll try the three cokes deal...but I dunno. And your birthday is going to be awesome so no worries. And just think of all the fun you'll have this summer. Hehehehe.  Travis is awesome. Pardon me while I stop the river of tears that last statement just caused.
