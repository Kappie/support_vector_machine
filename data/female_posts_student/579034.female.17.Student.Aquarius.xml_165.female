Frist, Deb and I lost, though narrowly, to Vin and Dave at pool. Then we went in the actuall pool for a bit. It was RELE cold and the boys were WAY too obsessed with the buckets and watering can. I tried to stay by the jets as much as possible but.. well... yeah, then after about 20 min in the pool it started to get rele cold and we got out and watched Kill Bill which is probably one of the most awesome movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Ate chips and cheetos like a beast, oh, popcorn too. That's what happens when you wake up at 4 in the afternoon and don't eat anything. I've like found so new old songs that I'm addicted to. "Cry" by Faith Hill, "Pretty Baby" Vanessa Carlton, "Leather and Lace" Stevie Nicks, "Your Song" Elton John, and a new song I love, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" by The Starting Line. Give uma listen. x0x
