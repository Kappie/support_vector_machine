We went into Christopher and Banks and let me just say I am not looking forward to reaching middle age and having to wearing that stuff.  If I ever say I think a sweater with a squirrel or a Halloween vest with pumpkins and cats on it is cute please hurt me!    I wish their was something decent on TV to watch.  Unfortunately, I don't count football decent or MTV cribs.  Someday, I want a house worthy of MTV cribs.  Wait...No, really I'd love to live in a penthouse in New York City that is lavishly furnished but very much a home at the same time.   Or, in one of those huge houses that is here (even tho I hate the winter with a passion!)  That would be nice!  Huge bedrooms, bathrooms, walk-in closets, and kitchen.  A movie theatre and a pool.  Defiantly Cribs worthy!  Alright I'm done rambling
