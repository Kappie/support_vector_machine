(refer to my post in may) i think i'm going to continue the story. not sure if u guys like the ending, sori for the bad ending if u guys don't like it.. haha... showing off my broken english again... *shy*   Leaf's departure is of wind's pursuit n bcoz tree didn't ask her to stay...   wind gave her care, concern, love n everything she wanted. Wind loved Leaf. if leaf wanted the moon, Wind would be sure to make a trip into the sky without hesitation. He knew tt deep in his heart, leaf's like his oxygen. Leaf's like his sunshine. If one day, one fine day, Leaf's going to leave him, he'll collapse. He'll lose the power to survive.   to wind, even though he knew tt he wasn't the one whom leaf loved the most, he's contented wif wat he has. at least he managed to have her by his side. at least he could take care of her n promise tt no one's ever going to hurt her. he thought tt she's always going to be by his side. rite?   wrong.  Wind soon began to realise tt wat leaf had done was not out of love. she didn't really love him. she took him as if he's a spare tyre. she took him as a substitution to the tree... (to be continued)
