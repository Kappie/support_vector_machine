Hope you enjoy seeing a little bit about what nursing school is like, or just catching up with me if you're someone I know or perhaps knew personally.  I'm going to make an effort to journal every day of my nursing school experience, but we'll see how big of an effort that becomes as time progresses.  Feel free to check back regularly for new postings!   A little background information on me, just in case...  27 years old.  Lived in MS all my life.  Small town, but I don't think I fit the associated stereotypes.  I have tattoos and live in a trailer though, so is that enough to be considered white trash?   LOL   :)  Shotgun marriage, going on 6 years.  My husband and I don't live together, but that's by necessity - not choice.  His job took him to a place I didn't care to move (the MS Delta - he's a service specialist for a commercial pest control company).  Two kids, both boys, ages 6 and 2 1/2.  Little one is still nursing and driving me crazy most of the time - typical toddler and a bully to boot.  Big one will be starting 1st grade in a few weeks.  Quit my full-time job last week.  Been working there as an engineering clerk for the past 6 years and doing school at night/online/part-time for the past 5.    Persistence pays off.  I was fortuante enough to get a nice scholarship package and will be starting the B.S.N. program at a local university this week.    Wish me luck..  and if you have any questions about me/school/my family/etc, just ask...  I'm pretty much an open book, and I'm always glad to help.
