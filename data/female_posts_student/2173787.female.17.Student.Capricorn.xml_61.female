Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something to commensurate to his capacity for wonder.  And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, i thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.  He had come a long was to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it.  He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.  Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further...And one fine morning----  So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past -  The Great Gatsby  F. Scott Fitzgerald  This is the last page of the most insightful books I have ever read and it ceaselessly draws my mind back to it.  Just because we will never reach what we are reaching for is no reason to give up.  I will never achieve the "American dream" I will never be satisfied, but I don't think I want to be.  I want to always have something that drives to run faster, to reach further forward.
