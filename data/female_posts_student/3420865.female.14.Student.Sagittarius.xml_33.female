"hey mum, i kindof want to get either my lip or my eyebrow pierced."-me "...NO.-mum "urgh."-me *20 seconds and a long silence later.* "...i think i'd rather you got your eyebrow pierced."-mum "omg really?! yeah i was semi-kidding about the lip thing."-me "yeah, i thought so. but kate, i don't think you could stand the pain. it would hurt  a lot ."-mum "yeah, but it would be so cool!"-me "yeah, it would."-mum --ok so for you people who don't understand why this has any significance... that's a maybe for getting my eyebrow pierced! aaah.--  so that was the awesome part of my evening... aha minus the part when i got to vanessa's house. we (actually, she) was singing along to  her karoaoke machine for like an hour.. while i straightened my hair with em's straightener. woot woot.  so we were at her house till like 9, and then we went to st. francis, and no one was there, so we sat and talked and slid down the banisters. t'was fun.  ok so tonight=semi-plans.  maybe  hanging out with vanessa, mike c, and ray and maybe other people... but since both of the guys said "sure maybe" when i asked them, i dunno yet.  k so i have several new loves... they= from first to last, keepsake, and the early november.   i never like the way you danced  by keepsake:    you told me not to put you up on a pedestal, fine then. i'll just sit here and die. it's all right. i'll drink another to you, i'll get in a fight or two, it doesn't matter with who. it's all right. a twenty one year old dream, now you'll corrupt the whole scene. i think it's gone far enough, it's all right. i think you know what i mean, i think you know what to do, i think i'm coming with you. looking back i never was so right. a night of fun would do us good night. so here's to losing you- a toast, my love, from me to you. drink up now, don't be a fool while you're still on my pedestal. so we should go out and dance, we'll have a night on the town, turn up the radio loud, it's all right. you'll drink another to me, you'll get in a fight or three, it doesn't matter to me. it's alright. a seventeen year old dream, now we've corrupted the whole scene, i think we've gone far enough, it's all right i think you know what i mean, i think you know what to do, i think i'm coming with you.    aaah no effing quotes... i suck at blogging now. i have no time/patience/life.  paice.  note to self: i miss you terribly.  kayte.
