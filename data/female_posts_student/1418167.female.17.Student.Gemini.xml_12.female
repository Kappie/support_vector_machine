I didn't want to put his poem on my blog because then someone would come after me for not asking permission. I checked, and my blog can be accessed through Google.  Yikes.    So, for those of you who have not yet talked to Miles, 1) do so immediately because she is an  amazing person , and 2) do so immediately because she has happy news. In honor of this happy news, I have written a poem (which is now Miles' away message... a great honor). Miles has approved my posting this, btw.    For... certain people... A Vision Without Shoes   It's been a time for the two of us  A time of separation But somehow, someday, there will be  A new time for celebration  I think these thoughts out of my window  As I ponder in shades of blue  And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  You run away romantic-like  Cause you wish to see me now  You walk way longer than expected My house is three miles out  I hold these dreams so quietly  As so many people do And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  I pull my door back hoping, thinking And all I can do is stare For my blue thoughts and dreams I guess Have somehow brought you here   I stand with fixed espression Til I get the urge to move  I move without a second thought  To hug my vision without shoes  Somehow I know this is temporary  Our day will come, it's true But now we remain here in this moment And you're a vision without shoes.    Leave comments everywhere!  I adore feeling loved. Like...  Miles: i love it Miles: love love love it Miles: itll be my away message.   My work here is done.  Sleep time now.
