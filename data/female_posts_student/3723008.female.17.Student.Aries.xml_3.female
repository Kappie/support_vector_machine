"Dawson, you've had a lifetime to process your feelings for me and i cant spend the rest of mine hoping you might throw a general glance in my direction in between your tortured teen romances with whatever Jen Lindley rolls into your life next"    "Dawson, you're not a little Oompa Loompa anymore. You're a big bad manly Oompa Loompa." -Pacey   "You don't understand, you don't get it. Those two words "Oompa Loompa" I hate those words. It's like every insecurity I have about myself exists inside those two words, all right? When you call me that, it's like you're exposing me. For not being Mr. Varsity Athlete, for not being sexually experienced. Look, I'm a virgin, okay? I'm not some big sex-stud like you." -Dawson    I am not William Wallace. But I am Pacey Witter. So they say. They say Pacey Witter is a dangerous man. A man who slaughters Capeside residents by the score... slaughters with jokes and buffoonery. And if he were here -- Heâ€™d destroy those who would judge him... with sparks from his eyes and wit from his arse. I am Pacey Witter. And I see a whole mob of fellow trailer trash here in shameful acceptance of false judgement and preconception. For who of you is in a position to judge? Is it you?! With your knock-off Brooks Brothers suit and those puzzling faux leather saddle shoes? Or is it you?! With that Edward Scissorhands hairdo and that... dead thing around  your neck? Who are you to judge me or mine? Who are any of you? And what kind of human tolerates being judged? Well, judgement stops today. That which scorns, deems to own me. And I am willing to trade the trappings of my dysfunctional life for one chance -- just one chance -- to stand up here in front of my fellow countrymen and tell my enemies... that you may take my life, but you will never take my freedom!!! -Pacey (Miss Windjammer Pageant)    "I haven't moved on, I haven't let go, And that is why I am linching on to the one thing I hold dear in my life." -Dawson Leery   "Faith that things will work out for the best. that whatever sent us off in different directions is the very same thing that will bring us back together." -Dawson   If people are truly, madly, deeply in love with eachother, they will find a way." -Dawson   "Joey, if we were truly meant to be, then will we find our way back to eachother." -Dawson   "Do you think every Joey has a Dawson and every Dawson has a Joey?" -Joey "hope so, for their sake." -Dawson   "I used to spend everyday thinking about you. When you walked by, I lost myself. Do you know what that's like?! To love someone so much but not have them love you back? You miss the way I looked at you. Well I don't miss the way you didn't look at me." -Henry   "You know you really love someone when you can spend the entire night just sitting by a fire watching them sleep." -Grams   " How could you simply be friends with someone when every time you look at them, all you think about is how much more you really want them?" -Dawson  "Well, you know, I'm no expert at this, Dawson, but I think it can be done." -Joey   You think because you were together, what she did to you hurts more? it doesn't. there's no difference, Pacey. she's sixteen. and so are you. We talk like we know what's going on, but we don't. We don't know anything, we're really young and we're gonna screw up a lot. we're gonna keep changing our minds and even sometimes our hearts. and through all that, the only real thing we can offer each other is forgiveness. i couldn't do that. or at least i did it too late. don't make my mistake. don't let yourself be so angry you stop loving. beacuse one day you will wake upfrom the anger and the person you love will be gone. " -Joey
