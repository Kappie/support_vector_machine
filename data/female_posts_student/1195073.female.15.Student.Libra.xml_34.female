Well, the high school situation is improving.  The older people don't scare me so much anymore, some of them are actually pretty nice.  My classes are all easy (as of right now), with the exception of English, which is a nightmare.  She keeps piling assignment on top of assignment until we are all confused about what is due when!  Lunch is great, too.  Lemon freeze cups are a gift from God!  AND I got my locker open!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I should also let you know that 24dotz has disbanded.  Well, I guess Matt is forming a new band with the name 24dotz, it's ska or something like that, nothing like the original.  Then again, he might have decided to change the name (if not Nate could take him to court claiming ownership of the name, a la Roger Waters and Pink Floyd).  Then again, the Pink Floyd name is actually worth something (no offense to anybody in 24dotz).  I really don't know what went wrong.  I guess it was some little rift in the band.  Other than that, everything was going amazing!  I mean, they had only gone through about four drummers in a matter of three months, I just don't see a problem.  OK, I don't want to get Martini or Hannibal (?) pissed at me, so I'll shut up now.  Oh, I also thought I'd let everyone know that I'm going to France this summer!!!  I'm not sure for how long, though.  It was originally going to be three weeks, but we decided that that's a long time to be overseas (and away from my parents, in my case).  So I think it'll only be ten days.  I'm not sure about the schedule yet, either, but my dad and I discussed it and we figure that my parents will drive my aunt and I to Chicago, then we'll either fly to New York City or Washington D.C. and meet my cousin and her two daughters, and then fly straight through to Heathrow in London.  We'll spend a couple days in London and then drive through the chunnel over to France.  We'll be based in Paris, but we will take day trips.  I'm sooooooooo excited!!!!  My aunt and I can't speak French, but my cousin's daughters go to a private school in Washington D.C., and all of their classes are in French, so they're very fluent.  Well, it's about 30 minutes past my bedtime, so I should go.  Ciao!!!
