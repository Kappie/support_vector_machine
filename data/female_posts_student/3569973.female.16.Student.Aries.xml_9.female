Monday I was working, Tuesday I was cleaning, Wednesday I finally got to see Jake for a couple of hours, Thursday I was working at a different place, Friday I went to work at Royal Pizza, Saturday I finally got to see Jake again, but then I had to go to work. Now FINALLY Sunday. I dont have to worry about a thing. But Monday it starts all over again. Except this time I only get two days off...Tuesday and Sunday. Its crazy, but now atleast I got a lot of money which is fine with me. I cant wait to go to bible study this week, there is just to much for me to hold in and I gotta let it out. Plus I havent seen Lauren or Fitzwater all summer. So I miss them. They finally will get the see the 4 kittens I saved. LOL. Sometime which if im not mistaken Tuesday I get to go do Habitat for Humanity and then go to bible study which is gonna be great. Then since Im doing that on Tuesday If I have Thursday off which I think I do, Me and Jake and some other people get to go to Hurricane Harbor. This week is gonna be great...hopefully. Well I gotta go take a shower. Till then, Later Days
