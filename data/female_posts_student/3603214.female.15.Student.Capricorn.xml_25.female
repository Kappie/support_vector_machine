It's gonna b wicked boring but Aaron's makin his triumphant return so it won't b as crappy as I thought it would b. Maybe crappier...but I doubt that lol. I have decided to make another "Out of Order" sign to put on the bathroom door even though a little kid will think we're serious, complain to their mommy or a person in charge and I will be corrected in front of my peers. But it will end in a good laugh. It'll be the adult's fault if the bus smells in the back. That's all I have to say about that. And Matt's not gonna be there so NO NOOSES! *score* I just found out that my "Messenger" Tim is gonna be a stupid Freshman. Good luck buddy. It's gonna be hell...jk, jk! He'll be my favorite freshie even though he's goin to Mater Dei *s/c* and I guess his parents think he's too good for Highland High even though that place KICKS! Cuz Tasha goes there. So does Dave, but yet again, another story. Well I'm still getting ready soo i'll bbl!
