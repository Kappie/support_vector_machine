Usually there is a system test around this time each month, so that's what I assumed was going on.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn off after 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes ...  I think my roommates and I stayed in our suite for a good 3-4 minutes before realizing it wasn't a drill.  Eventually we grabbed our keys and shoes and left the building.  Six fire trucks showed up but there was no fire to fight; it was just somebody cooking in another suite whose smoke detector went off and wouldn't stop.  When that happens long enough, the main alarm throughout the whole building goes off.  How embarrassing for that chef!   Even more embarrassing was my new roommate, who about 15 seconds into the alarm popped her head into the kitchen and asked me if we should leave the building.  I assured her that it was just a drill and she could go back to bed.  (Bed at 1:30?  Yes, grad students nap ... a lot.)  At least when I changed my mind about leaving a few minutes later, I did knock hard on her door and made sure she came with us to leave the building!  On another topic, today is the start of Pride Week in Toronto which will culminate with the giant Pride Parade on Sunday the 27th.  I'm fairly certain that this is the first or second largest GLBT parade in North America (I say second because I imagine that San Francisco has the edge on us.)  This year's theme, as I noted from  urlLink their website , is "Bursting with Fruit Flavours!" so most of the floats and costumes will reflect that.  There's some signage up around our residence that invites all interested students to come and march in the parade on Sunday.  I wouldn't mind doing that to show my support for the GLBT community as a straight woman, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, I'd be afraid of who would see me and what inferences they would draw about my participation.  More to come...
