But anyway, Something kinda took me by suprise during 5th in mr.hunt's class. But I'm not telling cuz Its really not my place to say. Um...lets see went to SAA and we did very well. We had a different judge than expected which didn't really matter cuz I hadn't even met the expected judge. Grandpa and Michelle are at dinner with dad. I haven't gotten to see them cuz i was performing. We're dog sitting Hershey lol. Right now she's just plopped down sleeping. From what I've heard Pangy and Hershey actually remembered eachother lol. The cat's just hanging out with me like usual lol.  Oh ya just wanna say hi to Ryan...i know he'll be reading this lol. Well I have another headache so I'll post tomarrow so bye.
