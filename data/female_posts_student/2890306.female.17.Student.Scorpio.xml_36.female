Now for a few details of each.  You're dying to know?  Yes, I could tell.  Mind reading is a specialty here at the Daily Muffin.    Anyhoo, I dragged Mom to the show choir competition on Saturday.  Actually, she was more willing to go than I had thought.  Parents, when you show interest in "hanging out" with them, are quite eager to play the role of "cool parent."  They, when exposed to the right conditions, enjoy bonding time.  So, off we went.  The groups competing were impressive.  I had no idea Best of Show was such a large, wide-reaching event.  There were choirs from all around the region, one of my favorites being from Minnesota.  Their show was a professional, crisply danced production, with a fog machine, numerous costume changes, and large fabric panels that transformed the stage into another world!  Needless to say, Mom and I were awestruck and wouldn't mind seeing that one again.  Earlier on, Roosevelt had performed.  I was impressed with their show.  I had no idea the group had progressed such a long way.  Everyone was giving their all, and the momentum they're going at predicts a great show next year.  Kudos to all.  After the competition, I went home, had a lovely dinner with the folks, and was off to Empire Bowl for a bit of cosmic bowling.  I honestly don't know why our friends don't just stay home, turn on some flashy lights, crank up loud music, and talk (scream?) to each other, for the bowling is just a pretense.  We all get tired of it after about a game anyway.  Ahh well, it is a good time either way, just a tad expensive.    Then today (Sunday), I worked a little, from 11-2 P.M.  Not too eventful.  As I mopped around the store, I was thinking that I would make a good waitress.  I mean, I'm friendly and pretty efficient.  What do you think?  I imagine the job would be fun, setting aside the fact that I'd only make $2-3/hour from the restaurant itself.  I would just have to do an outstanding job to make up for it in lucrative tips.  Haha.  Well, now I am off to bed.  After a delightful midnight bite of orange tea and toast topped with marmalade, I am quite satisfied.  Until tomorrow.
