She took it well.  When she finally called me i shut up.  Good thing too i hate when i act like that.  I dont know why i do it.  part of me wonders if thats who i really am though- ive seen myself that way before and im sure it will happen again but i usually feel like i should be kicking my own ass.  I am scared when i grow up and settle down ill ease into that and my life will go to shit cuz nobody likes a Deuschy such as my other side.  I said rude things all day and i criticized everything!  And my poor mom she started talking about Denny.... ( dead husband, dad's brother..etc)  because we were in helena where they lived together and my sister was born and there was a real senserity in her voice ya know..... like remembering the good life that has long since passed you by.  we had to drive by their old house and there was a crack in her voice as she said that he was a very nice person, And i know she put it lightly for me, she would have cried- I know it!  if she wasnt being strong for me i think she would have lost it there.  she loved him way more then she ever loved my dad... not that she doesnt love him, but ya know first loves and she and Den had the whole fairy tale falling in love thing even though they lived in a shitty small place they were happy and really in love.  Ive only ever seen pictures of the man, but there was a softness in his eyes that i can sometimes see in my mothers eyes and i know shes looking for it in my dads eyes.... and well its just not there.   My dad seems to take advantage of all she does for him ( i do too, so what am i talking about?) he remembers how important she is to him a few time a year, but its sad that he doesnt sit her down and tell her that he loves her like 80 times a day- thats what she deserves!  At least i tell her i love her, even if im being silly when i say it, she knows i mean it.     Well to make a long story short i treated my mom like shit and i dont know why.  Dont know why i did it and i dont know why she let me- she always lets me... maybe she loves me too much, but im glad, she makes me feel relevant.  Ha- a person only a mother could love.  How typical. She said something in anger i dont think she would have said if i didnt really push her to it- wasnt even that bad, but i felt it- it hurt.   Remind me to tell my mom i love her tomorrow. If you read to the bottom of this blog i apologize!  Im stupid! "I'm greatful my mommy loves me" Until Time Next
