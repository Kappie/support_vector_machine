"you should be thankful that i didnt go hysterical at barsam hall.. "      we've started with the external anatomy of the frog.. at first i find it disgusting but as time goes by... i got used to it!! my classmates were telling that i was in "full battle gear".. because i was in my lab. gown, face mask, gloves and the lab. goggles that abu gave me a month ago.. we'll have another practical exam for laboratory on thursday (jodette's bday)..       i went to merriam webster to accompany richard to buy school supplies.. i also bought things for myself..      for everybody's information... my birthday is nearing!! (ipangalandakan ba?!) i still dont know if im gonna have a party.. or just treat my friends and family out to dinner.. but one thing's for sure.. ive already have plans on the exact date of my birthday.. i was not the one who arranged it.. it was my cousin, joanne, and my mom!! i promise to make it up to all those whom i love!!      because of all the things about school.. i havent read anything good.. i havent read angels and demons.. and i dont want to start da vinci code unless ive finished with ad.. so cheska... im really expecting that from you.. you would really make me happy.. kaya nga ni-request ko tlaga yan sayo.. coz i believe that you want to finally see a broad smile on my face!! tsk tsk tsk!! there are a lot of things that i want for my birthday.. haii!!
