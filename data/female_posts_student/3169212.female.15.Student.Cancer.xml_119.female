I wouldn't call it reincarnated. That impliessome kind of new body, or coming back as a butterfly or a dog or something...this is same body, just without the extra holes.   Swiss cheese...(do they have swiss cheese in ancient china?) Don't think i've ever had lots of holes all at once but i've had a couple. That was knifes, and acid though.      Well, either way you're still a better being than i am for doing it. (I'm being nice; make the most of it)      I'm sure Selmak can give you a much better blow-b-blow description of exactly where we were, why we were doing it, and why Daniel thought he could get away with it.      Alright, alright, i get the point. Its just a bit of a sore point for me.  Really  sore point.       I was called in on a Saturday for THIS?! Its GreenPeace, you nitwit. Just hold a couple of pigeons hostage and theyll climb down to trade their lives for the little buggers.- Gimli.     		    urlLink    Yahoo!
