Everyone has settled down about the report card now. I doubt I'll be going to Vic this year though, very much... most unfortunate.  It will be an adventure in a new school, I must say. (20 bucks says I'm the loner of the school.) A happy note! Elya said my Gothic Lolita Bible (the 13th one) came! She was kind enough to order it for me. I'll have to scan that one... Come to think of it, I still have a lot of work to do on Digi-Loli. I have posters to draw too, for the local anime convention. It's for charity, so that's really neat... So much work to do. This is going to be such a busy year for me. I won't leave my room hardly, so I'll have to get a coffee machine for my room... and decorate it so I can stand it long enough to be in there for days at a time.  (The plan for this year, is, to actually  not  screw up.)
