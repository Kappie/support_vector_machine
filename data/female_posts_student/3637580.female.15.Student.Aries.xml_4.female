He really used to be one of my best friends ever!Everyone was over there, I felt kinda weird walking in at 10:30, you could tell everyone had already been having a really good time. Bret, Reese, Stephie, Shelly, and Brena were all there, There were also 3 other people I hadn't met before.  I really wish all of us could have kept in touch more. Mikey and me talked for a while, he's such a dick sometimes, but I love that kid. He used to be there for me all the time, I could tell him like anything, But it was kinda weird...we talked about him and Reese and what happened to them. I dunno man. I told him I was "talking" to someone , but I can't even talk to him about the smallest things like that, not after what happened. haha I used to be able to tell him anything, like I could even tell him my "girl" problems that's how comfortable I became with him, But now I can't even talk to him about anything. We both could tell it was weird. But other than the whole.."mikey and me thing" , I had a really good time.   Ugh..anyway enough of that.. I don't even know what's going on anymore. I keep hoping for the best with everything, but I trully just can't tell if things are going good or bad. I really want things to work, and i know they have the potential to go somewhere.Is that weird for me to want that, I mean should I just wanna sit back and let nothing happen.I DUNNO UGHHH!! I just want things to be understandable and not confusing cause I think that would make things sooo much better! But that's just my opinion. I mean things are kinda laid back, so I don't wanna seem impulsive and be like...WHAT'S GOING ON ..!??!?!So I don't say anything at all.. I just sit back and wait for what never comes. I just hate things when they are un-clear..I think someone needs so to step up and take the initiative !! haha  But it's cool. This time's gunna be diffrent , I'm not getting worked up over something that's not even going wrong. But who knows? BoYs ArE hArD wOrK!!   Man...I have no attention span..I've been writing this thing for like an hour, but I have the T.V. on and so I keep losing my concentration haha. Opps..ohh well.   OLIVIA STANSIC!! What am I going to do without you for 2 whole weeks!! And it's the fact that your going to be in freaking Italy!! But it's ok cause your going to the Prada outlet for me!! (ohh wait i don't have 200 dollars..) You better at least email me once from there and tell me about the WONDERFUL Italian guys that you meet! haha!  This is a stupid pointless entry ...Sry if you were looking foward to something good and juicy, cause this isn't it!! It's just a bunch of stupid random things! I have alot more stupid stuff to write about but I'm really tired and I guess I'm going to bed now....Night
