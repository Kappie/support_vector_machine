One thing after another came up, and I, yes I, was caught right straight smack in the middle where I always seem to get caught. Are you ready for these complaints?! *insert "I don't think your ready for this jelly"* Unfortunately, the complaints are not booty-licious. (ahem, sorry.)  Anyways, my first complaint is this: If a company expects to do a substantial amount of buisness, than why do they hire people they know will cause trouble or that will not work? I mean, hello! What the heck is wrong with that statement?! If not hire people who will work, than train them well and make them work. If they don't like it than they can quit of their own accord. But don't make everyone else pay for something that is the upper management's problem. Seriously guys... let's think long and hard about that one.  Second complaint: Since you seem to only hire duds, at least keep 2 or 3 backups ready so that they can take their place when they get fired (as, they normally do.), so that the expierenced people who have asked for a certain scedule do not leave whenever they're schedule's get changed because of the void left in these fired people's wakes. Please. PLEASE.  Third complaint: All ya'll people, yes, all of ya'll, need to freaking learn some manners. When you see a person rushing around all over the place, do not get angry or upset because they cannot help you in that second. I understand that sometimes, people need to be asked to do their job, but as you can see, most of us don't. So, if your order is like, 10 seconds late, deal with it. We are trying the best we can with the help we have. If your so busy, than why don't you come back later? I mean, it really seems a waste to spend all that time in line for one cup of coffee and then spending all that time yelling at the window person just cause the car in front of them ordered 5 million things. It really does.  Fourth Complaint: God- get a work ethic trend started please! I am sorry that I do not stop working, and I am sorry that I do my job. But it's not my problem that you guys look bad just standing there while I work. Just blame it one me, say "Meghan was working cause she wanted to" that should get people off your back.  Fifth Complaint: When asked to pull around to the backside of the building, please do it.  And, that's all for tonight. I'm sure I'll come up with more by the time summer is over.    I leave thee with this- For here or to go?! Have a great evening.
