I wrote him a note, and he never said another word to me. I did give him, in the note, a chance to save the fragment of a realtionship we had. In his silence, he chose not to. So we parted, I thought, on not the best of terms.  So, on Tuesday, my cell-phone rings(a very rare thing). And it was him. After a short game of Guess-Who, to which I already knew the answer, I just said "Oh my gosh." He laughed, suggesting that maybe I was surprised to hear from him? And I told him I was, and it was nice to hear from him, and we just talked about life for about five minutes. And then he went to bed, since it was 10:30 and he had to work at five. So I was left toally confused.  And I really don't know what to think. Perhaps he wants only to be friends, but that seems a bit strange, as we were not friends before he asked me out. We simply had a mutual crush.  Or maybe, by a slight chance, he is between girlfriends and a bit of interest in me has come up again. And that scares me, because i don't need a reason to like him again. Before he called, I had managed to reduce him to a distant memory and a lesson learned. And now all of these emotions are coming back, and I don't know why. I need a strong, Christian guy with similar interests, so we will have something to talk about. But his call did remind me to pray for him, and so I am.  I guess in the first few weeks of school, I will see what became of us. But unless he calls again, I am left wondering for the summer.
