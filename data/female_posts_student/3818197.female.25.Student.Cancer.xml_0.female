The idea for my research came to me as I was leaving the airport on my way back from Seattle last April.  I decided I wanted to do some work based on the experiences of refugees based on the concept of diaspora.  At first, I was ready to go out there and interview everyone who has come to this country as a refugee in order to preserve their oral histories.  Then I realize how absurd that goal was considering that I only have an X amount of time to actually complete this research and have a thorough analysis of the cases studied.  So I had to narrow down and that was really hard.  I trully wanted to go out there and spend the rest of my time interviewing families and getting to hear all their stories.  So I decided to go by gender.  Females.  Then I decided Afghan women would be an excellent group to work with.  Then I spent a week in Indiana at a McNair Senior Conferences and ended up coming home with yet another change of heart.  Since I am a double major and I have an equal amount of love for both of the degrees I have been persuing (Spanish and Multi Ethnic Studies), I decided that it would fit both categories if I worked on the experiences of Cuban refugees in Idaho, more specifically in Boise.  For example, I'm curious to know why they have resettle in this area of the country as oppose to an are such as Florida or New York where there are thousands of 'compatriotas'.  Now, I have been refining that even further into what exaclty is that i want to get from this.  This is what I got so far: As a two part project I have set up to go on with the recording of the oral histories, I am getting ready to lear how to transcribe them so that I have a solid data base to base my reasearch on.  I want to explore the causes and consequences of resettlement and the effects that this has in these people's lifes.  I also want to go into the politic aspect of it and find out more about the role that both the government of the U.S and Cuba play in these people's life's decitions.  Or something like that.  So, at a huge glance, there you have it.
