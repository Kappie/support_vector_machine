I've also discovered that Jared is upset with me or something. He's kind of the person that I always complain to and he makes me feel better about situations, but he didn't make me feel better about a problem that I was having earlier this week. I sent him an e-mail about a hypothetical situation (the one I explained to Ross), but it's been three days and he hasn't responded. Also, I haven't talked to him since, I'm pretty sure, the same day I sent him the e-mail. I always talk to Jared and all the sudden he doesn't want to talk to me? What's up with that? All I asked for was a little help. Alas, I solved my own problem anyway and things are looking OK. I'm getting a haircut tomorrow. Finally. I didn't go to take senior pictures today because I need one. Right now my hair is all one length and it's really boring, and I'm finally going to get one. I sure hope it's not ugly, because I don't like to look ugly.
