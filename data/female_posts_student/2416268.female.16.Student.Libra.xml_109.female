You feel quite uncomfortable in situations where you have to reveal a little skin, and likely go out of your way to avoid them altogether. You feel inadequate when you compare yourself to others, and may even go to extreme lengths (plastic surgery, severe dieting) to change the way you look. What it boils down to is this: the negative view you have of your looks is putting a serious damper on the way you live. You don't always wear the clothes you'd like because of insecurities, you may lack the confidence to pursue the people you're attracted to, and likely spend more time than you should worrying about physical flaws. The fact is, you're downright hard on yourself - but it doesn't have to be this way. Everyone struggles with insecurity during different periods of their lives; think of the number of movie stars and super models that spent an adolescence miserable, convinced they were hideously ugly. While we can't all be supermodels, we all have our unique style and look that makes us attractive. The world would be boring if we were all a bunch of Barbie and Ken dolls. No matter how we fit in to society's constantly changing beauty standards, we always judge ourselves much more harshly than other people do. We think we've got a huge schnoz; others think it's regal. We hate our freckles; other people think they're charming. Overall, there's one kind of beauty that never dies - inner confidence. Make it your mission!       The how "blonde" are you test   Your score 5  You haven't got a drop of blonde in you...whether or not you've been blessed with golden tresses. You don't behave in any of the typical blonde ways, and probably don't fall for all that stereotypical "dumb blonde" nonsense. You know that using hair color to determine character is ridiculous, and would rather be seen for the unique individual that you are. How very un-blonde of you!     The fitness test   Your score 100  Congratulations, you have reached the rank of 'fitness buff'! Your knowledge of exercise trivia is superb. You are ready to tailor a fitness routine that is optimal for you (if you haven't already).      The do you have a sense of humour test   Your score 70  Your sense of humor is pretty good. It may not be as wacky as that of some people (like us apparently) but you're pretty cool in our books! You can laugh at most things and maybe even get a kick out of the non-sense you say and do from time to time as well. Good for you! Hey, if you can't laugh at yourself, who can you laugh at right? Just kidding.      The $10 million test   Your score 5  Congratulations, you have personal integrity. Your answers revealed that you would not go all out to get your hands on ten million bucks. There may be one or two things that you would consider, but overall you're not willing to commit acts that are outright repulsive or might hurt anyone just to hit the jackpot. You likely realize that money does not equal happiness, and don't want to throw all your self-respect out the window for a windfall. You are not easily bought!      The personal hygene test   Your Score 95  Germs are your enemy, and you've staged an all out war against them. You're usually sporting fresh undies and your hair is squeaky clean. You wouldn't dare eat something that fell on the floor, and the thought of using someone else's toothbrush gives you the jeebies. Of course, everyone has certain things they find particularly repulsive, but there's also the possibility of going too far - do you shower several times a day, even though you don't really need to? Do you feel horribly uncomfortable in less-than-spotless environments, like a friend's neglected bathroom? While it's certainly beneficial to maintain a high level of hygiene, scientists have recently discovered that society's obsession with cleanliness is resulting in weakened immune systems. If we never allow ourselves the slightest exposure to some creepy crawlies, our bodies don't learn that they are, in fact, harmless. So keep on washing your hair and changing that underwearâ€¦but you could relax a little!     The friendship test   Your Score 95  Camaraderie is your specialty, and you tend to keep your pals at the very top of your priority list. When a friend is in need, whether for emotional support, a financial boost, or a simple helping hand, they can count on you to come through. You give the very best of yourself, and will actually put your own desires (and sometimes needs) on hold for the sake of a pal's happiness. Your friends surely appreciate your self-sacrificing nature and probably sing your praises. While it's wonderful to show such intense dedication, however, there could be some negative consequences to your high level of commitment; do you ever feel, for example, that you are giving much more than others give in return, or that you are being taken advantage of? While most people see the value of such a fab friend, there are also folks who will milk your generosity for all its worth - not always out of maliciousness, but sometimes because it's just too easy. There is also the danger of developing bitter feelings when you give up your own wants for those of others - a true friend, in fact, will not expect you to drop everything for them in every situation, and will surely respect your decision to put yourself first from time to time.       l  o  v  e   y  e    xxxxxxxx
