Not regular but the $32 one. Of course I ate it with my 5 classmates. AND I just ate Strawberry cheesecake ice cream juz now, no wonder I gained weight so fast. (>. EXCITING  shows. I mean, the other participants are also worth watching and they practised very hard. BUT at least show the parade contignent, they learned marching for months and practising their opening- of- umbrellas to form Singapore flag for  months . Spare some thought for them.
