I'm ready to let go, and yet there is nothing to replace you. The part you me that you took is still gone, and I'm not sure I want it back. After what I leared about myself from you.   Sometimes loosing yourself in someone is the best way of learing what is left behind. What is left behind? Is it a wiser, more complete self? or just a slightly more fragmented puzzel that's missing a piece it didn't need?  Perhaps that's the Blank Rune. The unknowable, the undecided, the everchaning dark logic that only follows the rules it makes up as it goes along the way, dragging us kicking and screaming, into the light.
