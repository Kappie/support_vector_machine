Well, in actuallity, he's done nothing deliberate to me, it's just that... he didn't choose me... and I understand the reasoning, but I'm still jelous and pissed off and it's really late and I'm wrambling.... Amy, don't let me post this late anymore.... nothing good ever comes out of it....  (wait.... it's not so much 'one true love' but yea know....) oh lordy--    You are Big Apple Heartbreak from the album One For The Kids. You are emotional and wish you could have your one true love back.    urlLink   What Yellowcard song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
