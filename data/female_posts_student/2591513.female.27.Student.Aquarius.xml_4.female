I am a little peeved at people and their priorities...but that is just me.  I am not even going to go into it.  It is life and I am trying not to harbor any ill feelings to anyone...workd for most the time, not to one person in particular, but those of you who read this know my beef with that someone...haha.  And NO that someone is not related to me.  So anyway, today everyone is feeling sick, bad timing with school just starting and all.  I don't want to have to do this semester begging my professors not to drop me.  Although I have already.  I miss my first day of class because my uncle's mother passed away.  I don't want to miss her funeral.  My uncle Mike is a great man and I would like to be there for him and his family.  It is sad.  I know he must be having a hard time.  Lately I have been full of sadness for my husband's friend's passing.  After hearing how he took his life I am brought back to my past and remembering feeling like there was no other alternative but to take your life.  Of course back then it was young adolescent stupidity...but that feeling was so real.  So thinking about how rock bottom he must have felt.  It makes me sad.  I also think heavily about the daughter who will grow up wondering why her father is gone in such a tragic way.  I can't begin to imagine how to help a child go through something as traumatic as that.
