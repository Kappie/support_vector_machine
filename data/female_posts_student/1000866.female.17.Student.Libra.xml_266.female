His mom told me when I called Ryan's, because I usually end up talking to her for like...fifteen minutes before Ryan, haha, but....GAH!!!!!!!!!! She's like, "Yeah, we decided just this mroning to go." She thought Ryan had already told me, but...noooo, he didn't. He said sorry about a thousand times, and I'm not mad or anything, just extremely bummed. I was going to spend a really nice night with him tomorrow night. We were going to go have a picnic and stuff, since I was going on vacation Friday, which turns out not to be til Saturday anyway. GAH. I'm so frustrated right now, and on top of everything else something's bothering me that shouldn't be bothering me at all. Poo on a stick. I don't even know if I'll get to see Ryan tomorrow because I'll be gone all tomorrow morning. PLUS to add on to this, I didn't get to see Joanne today, and we didn't get to watch Hitch Hiker's because of my dumb back. I'm going to go beat my pillow up now...excuse me.
