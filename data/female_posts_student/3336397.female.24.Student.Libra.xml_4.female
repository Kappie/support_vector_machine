It was good and bad felt really discouraged just wanted to cry on someone's shoulder but i said to myself "i guess that is what life is and better deal with it". Life wont be as smooth as i wish it to be and i guess that would be boring.I saw my niece she is really become big, she is so cute , full of life and innocent. She is just so amazing, its like a miracle , she is like a gift. she is really amazing, u now babies have that power u see them u forget everything what is bothering you, you just feel at peace. She was just crying and looking around to know her surroundings and just by taking care of her. You feel happy and contented.   Anyways i have started working on my dissertation.I am just so scared. I hope i do it. I am not that clever to work smartly but i try me level best. I want to work in this country now , but for that I have to try very hard. I know if i put my mind to it i will do it. I ma afraid of failure. I just want to make a small mark before i die. I hope it I make it one day.   My life is kinda sad , but i am ok ,I study, i have some friends, I socialise with my mba class and some other friends. I guess i am not that interesting but i try my best> I Kinda decorate my house , put flowers every week , try to cook different things and try to network. I know its kind of monotnous but i am not that sad ,I mean from my heart. But there is always sense of wanting someone beside you when you are happy sad or just normal.Its that craving of affcetion . like you know u have someone that you can cry to , laugh aloud or just plainly have fun. I do have fun but not in that manner, I dont know what i have become , but I know that right i am just feeling lost and sad and just want soembody to love me and tell me everything is going to be alright.   Anyways i better go before i just keep on saying bull shit. Take lots of care. have a great day. Whenever u settle down have lots of babies, they are the best gift god can give you. They are a state of art
