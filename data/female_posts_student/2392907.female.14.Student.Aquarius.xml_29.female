Why he didn't just pick Janey up, seeing as they live on the same street, beats me.   Woah, whose Lexuz is that? What a stunner..  thinks Adam as he pulls up near the restaurant.  Damn, who is it? Woah. Some hot chick with a hot car. Whew.    Oh god. This is it, I guess  Thinks Jane.  Adam pulls himself out of his car, rather ashamed of his car, parked next to the Lexus. He strides into the restaurant.  "Erm, reservation for two?" "Your name, sir?" "Levine." "This way, sir." "Err, thank you."   We're walking towards the table with the hot chick. Uh oh, he got me confused. Why does this always happen to me? It always ends up in some embarrassing scene as well. stupid restaurant.  Adam worries.  Jane looks up.  Is that Adam? Why is he wearing pink?    Oh my god, that's Jane. Oh my god, Jane was the hot chick. Oh my god. And she has a Lexus! Oh my god. Wait. Oh man she's hot.  Adam's jaw literally falls open.  "Here, sir." "Uuuh? Uh. Thunker," Adam says, meaning to say "Oh, Thank you," but not quite managing, what with the open mouth and all.  Silence. Adam's mouth is still open.  "Hi." Jane says awkwardly. "Uh." Adam grunts (hi) "Um, why is your mouth open? What is it? Have I got lipstick on my teeth?" "Uoh, uoh, uoh," says Adam quickly, shaking his head (No, no, no) "Err... ok then." janey blinks. "Ih huh hah..." (It's just that) Adam closes his mouth with his hand, realising he has dribbled a bit and there is now a conspicuous dot somewhere down Ryan's shirt.  Ohhh shit.  he thinks  just grrreat.  "I'm so sorry... I um, have a um, medical, er, thingy, with my mouth, and the thingy with the erm... yuh." Janey laughs.
