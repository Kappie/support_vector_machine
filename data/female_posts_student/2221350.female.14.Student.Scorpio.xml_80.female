Saturday, I cleaned stuff and played internet pool.  Sunday I helped mom wax her car, cleaned my room, ate Mexican food((w00t)), and cleaned some other stuff. Then I stayed on the computer doing homework/playing pool until 2AM. Around then I went to my room and mom knocked on the wall. When I went to see what was going on she said she couldn't sleep because she hadn't made any chicken salad. So, sure enough, I was in the kitchen with her chopping pickles until 2:30 when I finally went to bed.   I got up at 6AM and took a nice shower. I enjoy showering in the mornings, it's just hard because Devon is still here and she's always trying to kill me. Seriously, I closed the door to get in the tub and I locked it and she freaked out and started banging on the door like crazy, which woke up mammaw. When I first got up I was super tired, but I had coffee and I've been stupendously energetic all day. It's kind of freaky, if you think about it, that I feel better on 3 1/2 hours than I do on my regular 6, but hey,  whatever works.   this week most of school will be about LEAP practice. The only thing I hate more than standardized test practice is standardized tests, and that's the truth.  I was supposed to have read "a tale of two cities" and watched a movie called "Catherine the great", I did neither and still made 100% on both reports. ((score))  I didn't get to see the Jesus movie, but I saw Mystic river on Friday. To me it was a good story, but the editing was terrible. There were so many long, empty pauses, all the dramaticism you'd think would go along with a long, empty pause was lost. If I had to rate it, I'd say it was a rentable movie, and I say that simply because you'll be glad you have the fast forward button for when the camera pans around the river for the 3rd time and plays some crappy soundtrack music. The acting was good too, I see why Sean Penn was nominated.  this morning in the car, mom yelled at me for saying that she was tipsy at my IEP meeting. The only reason I said this was because she normally wouldn't get so upset over a B and call a teacher a bitch whore C%^, so maybe she was tired or pissed off or something, but I don't care now. This morning, however, I cared a lot. I decided that my blog had caused too many arguments and even if it kept me sane and I love it it's not worth it and that the stress I relieve by writing is sent back to me two-fold by all the negative feedback from the family. But I changed my mind, because I would die without blogging.   today mom was "really really tired", i.e., she was acting crazy. She was 40 minutes late picking me up from school and she made me miss guitar. The details aren't important, but it pissed me off. The only day of the week that she MUST be on time, and she's always always late. Last week it was Steven, the week before, she lied to me and said Mr. Beach had cancelled when he really hadn't, so that she could be with Steven. bluh.  on a happier note, we got some itty bitty bread, it's 1/4 the size of normal bread, and I love it. I had itty bitty sandwitches for lunch today, along with an apple. What is it about eating apples that makes me happy. Not after you eat, but the actual eating of them. Emily said it was the freshness, but I don't know. All I know is I'm going to eat more apples.  I'm going majorly stir crazy. I haven't been out of Shreveport since going to Houston last summer, and it's getting to me. I want to go out of town, and I don't even care where, as long as it doesn't resemble Shreveport and I get to stay in a hotel. I would like to go to L.A. more than anything else and I've been saying so for years. So of course mom is going and she's not taking me. I want to go to new York city, Dallas, St. Louis, Ohio, ANYWHERE. I think at this point I would even go to Mississippi! One thing I really wanna do is go back to the Houston museum's butterfly thingy, it was the best. Me being such an animal freak, all those butterflies flitting around and sitting on me and stuff was a super cool thing. Plus we had to leave early last time because we had a baby with us, so I didn't get my fill quite yet.  this week's songs of the days((LOL)) will be devoted to the Violent Femmes. I LOVE THEM. So get ready folks.   instead of writing my hundred things all at once, I'm going to have a couple on every post, then maybe I'll put them all together or something like that.   poor Martha Stewart was convicted. I don't exactly know how I feel about this.   !. Whales make me cry 2. Rice crispie treats are my favorite 3. I wish I had the skin right below my bottom lip pierced 4. The farthest I've been away from home is prince Edward island, Canada 5. I love Robert frost
