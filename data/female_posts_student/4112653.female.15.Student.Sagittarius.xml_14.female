Moving Tittanya's dagger in front of her, Marion desperately tried to think of a plan.  Tittanya fared little better than Marion, having no weapon other than the stone. it held them off, but only when directed straight at one. "Damien." Tittanya's voice was barely a wisper. As one of the creatures managed to circle her and grab the back of her neck, Tittanya screamed to the only other person she could think of: "MARION!!!"  Marion heard the cry and hesitated long enough that she was disarmed. "TITTANYA!!!"  Damien raised his head as he heard the exchange. "Damn it all!" He passed through the worlds and grabed Tittanya. She was weak, but he heard her: "Got to save Marion, got to fight creatures." "Shhh..." Damien said tenderly, "Yes, we'll help her and get her help against these creatures, because none must interfere with your Final Fight."
