Born Steven Paul Smith, 06 August, 1969. Lived in Ohmaha, Nebraska until his parents divorced. Moved near Dallas, Texas with his mother. Decided to play bass at age five. [Inspired by the White Album] Picked up playing the piano by nine, for one year. At age ten, Elliott began drinking alcohol. Began playing Clarinet during middle school. During the late seventies Elliott visited his father in Portland. When he was twelve, his father gave him his first guitar. By fourteen, Elliott had begun using marijuana. In the mid-seventies, Elliott began experimenting with recording. His freshman year he moved from Texas to Portland. He lived with his father, a psychitrist:  "I would have liked to have done the same job. I've read a lot on that subject; particularly Freud. But anyhow, I was never the type to become a psychiatrist or a psychologist; I don't have enough to offer other people. As a kid, I wanted to be a mathematician, but then I realized I'd ever be able to be independent, that I'd have to work for a business or some other organization. I turned back to my one passion-music ..."  Elliott attended Lincoln High School. His first band was "Stranger Than Fiction", which made several tapes. In 1986 [age 17] he wrote "Condor Avenue" - ended up on "Roman Candle." Elliott graduated named a National Merit Schollar at Lincoln. Attended Hampshire College - Political Science / PHilosophy. Formed the short-lived "A Murder of Crows" Met Neil Gust, who wrote gay-themed songs: "homocore" or "queercore." They formed the band "Heatmiser" and began playing in 1992. Two years later they released "Yellow No. 5" and "Cop and Speeder." Elliott didnt like the music he played and could not relate to it. Eventually, Elliott went solo and released "Roman Candle."  .d.i.s.c.o.g.r.a.p.h.y.  --> Roman Candle, 1994 - "Drive All Over Town" --> Elliott Smith, 1995 - "St. Ide's Heaven" --> Either/Or, 1997 - "Pictures of Me" --> XO, 1998 - "Bled White" --> Figure 8, 2000 - "Stupidity Tries" / "Bye"  Later, Elliott's song "Miss Misery" was put on the soundtrack for Gus Van Sant's movie "Good Will Hunting" which earned him an Academy Awards nomination.  In late 2003, Elliott was recording the tracks for his upcoming album "From A Basement On A Hill." Sadly, he died in October of the same year.  Eliott's death was ruled suicide by a stab wound to the chest, but many close to him believe he was killed by his girlfriend, JJ something-or-rather.
