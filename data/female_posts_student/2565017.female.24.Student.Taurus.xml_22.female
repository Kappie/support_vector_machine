We just had a funny moment: we were carrying some stuff to her car, and I wondered quite a bit when she opened the trunk from inside the car... why not open the trunk lock from outside. When she got to the back of the car, I did ask her about that... she said there's no lock.   I look at her amazed and said "what are you talking about, it's right there!" and pointed it out to her. Now it was her turn to be amazed. She just never spotted it, even though she's had the car for about 2 weeks, and she's washed it 3 times. LOL. Blonde or what :P  Nah, she's not blonde :D  Ok, now, what else I've been doing the last couple of days when I've had no time to blog...  Oh, it's just yesterday (monday) and today then! Good, I don't have to write too much =) Well, yesterday... oh my god, I don't want to remember yesterday's schoolday!!! I was so embarrassing at finnish class. We had this drama rehersal kind of thing.  Well first it went well... but when we had to start improvising, I got wee bit too carried away.... ok, ok, I got way carried away... I made a "one woman show" of it, which was idiotic. Sigh. But actually, it was funny too. At least people laughed a lot :P Hopefully not just at me, lol.  What can I say... I'm downright silly.  Well, after all that, I, Satu and Hanna did some groupword about research and information analysis. Almost finished it, but then we got too tired and giggly and decided to continue some other day (wednesday)! And in the evening, I went to Anne's (she called me for dinner... guess what it was... yep, pizza, blugh) and we cooked together and had dinner.  And today.... well... *sigh* I've continued being a loser. I didn't go to school today. I stayed up way too late last night and felt horribly tired in the morning. So I refused to obey my alarm clock and slept in.   After I got up, I thought I might as well do  something , and so I made a proper and complete spring cleaning in my room. Noticed a lot of things I need (stationary and some storage boxes) and a lot of things I do not need (and they are taking too much of my space). So I packed some things away.  Now I'm again at Anne's, after washing some laundry... had yesterday's pizza (yuck! I'm beginning to loath pizza now) and we're soon going to watch 'Sex and the City' from telly =)  So, this is all I've been doing... nothing interesting really. The "heat wave", by the way, ended to last Sunday's thunder storm... it's barely + Celsius anymore.  And all this time.... I'm missing my One and Only Special Person. You know who you are =) If you read this, blow me a kiss :) *hugs* I think of you all the time.
