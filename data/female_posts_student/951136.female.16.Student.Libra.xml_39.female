Got dresses in white blouse and blue shirt over, and jeans. complete w. my boots and cute hair! I was busying around making my own little coffee to put in a to go heat mug, and ready to walk out the door to go out! now this was all perfect and you can just imagine it in 10 years...minus the fact that my mom had called from the auto check to tell me that we were going out shopping when she got home- WHEN she got home. so i sat there drinking my coffee not looking to shabyy if i may say so.AND waiting for a god damn ride! like a girl stood up on her prom night. sigh. there's alway a catch. Thus, in my own little world i'm sitting here and thinking about a perfect life that i WILL someday have. spurred on a bit by my REreading   Boy Next Door   and watching  While You Were Sleeping  and alyssa when i live in england and have settled down come and visit me! you can bring mark too! he's fit in there perfect. course, he'd fit in perfect anywhere with hot girls. ( i love you mark!)  BUT AGAIN!...life sucks lets move to london.      I actually have NO clue what the hell is wrong with me. i'm weirdly happy, and O.K. with everything. Its almost annoying me, much less the ppl i afflict. but all i want is to live alone! in an apartment! and do what i want when i want! argh! you have no idea how insufferable it is!? dont you remember when you couldn't drive yet!? you couldnt' jsut pick up and leave to go get all your freinds and go out somewhere, or over to someone elses house.   And someone is like hey, ya know we're having a get together/party tonight. come! there'll be a lot of people. lot of music. lot of dancing and you can make your own fun. NOT: ASkING your MOTHER. and her saying. NO! i dont know these people! are they're parents going to be there?! I havent met them! should i call them now! who all is goign to be there!! i dont know them!? are there boys invited!?GASP  BLOODY FUCK MOTHER! GOD DAMNIT! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!...ya know   NEWS FLASH!!   ...there are boys in the world. When people, music, and alcohol get together 9 times out of 10 it equals fun. with your occasional stupid ass person drinking too much and flying over a bridge. but that's there own problem! there is a world out there! with PEOPLE! you can't NOT live jsut because you sometimes get hurt. thats the way things are!   You cannot be so ignorant and naive to think that it is ok to live in a shell. never experience life. i'm not saying that drinking is life and fun, its bad i know. but being out somewhere, with people. having FUN. pleasing yourself. is the only way to live. like everyone says, you can't hid them from it forever. b.c. one say they will get out, and they will see it and freak, or want to try it all once and will go absolutly wild w. pent up energy and hormones. you say so yourself about money! if you never learn to spend in moderation and be responsible, you'll be in big trouble. so stop preaching to the choir.  And wake up. you cannot sit at home alone, with no friends. watching tv til you are falling asleep to A  You're living in KATY TEXAS! your at the bottom of the food chain my dear. and no one can save you but yourself.  so why should i succom to it all!? i refuse. i will shoot myself before i find myself with few freinds, doing nothing every weekend and alone in front of the T.V. i promise you.  now every few weekends, hey its great to go see a movie alone. and to do nothing and vege out. but when it is ALL you have, to do. Thats hitting rock bottom. so there ya go. not that it matters or is put in some great revelation way as alanah does it, it is just a thought that i am bored- have nohting else to talk about nothing about.   "We could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only joy in the world."
