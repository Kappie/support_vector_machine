Tawny's new sister, Kate, is sooooooo adorable! She is such a little bity thing though! I think if I just barely touched her, she would break into a million billion pieces!   I was talking with Tawny about how I thought TJ was avoiding me, and she kept smiling and looking suspicious. I knew she knew something, so I made her spill the beans. She said that TJ told her that he's afraid of asking me to be his girlfriend, because he thinks if anything ever happened to where we'd break up, that we wouldn't be close friends anymore! I think that is so sweet of him to value our friendship so much! ::dreamy sigh:: It makes me like him all the more! But, he should really have confronted me about something like that. I mean, I'm totally crazy about him, and I could have told him that I wouldn't ditch him as a friend just because something stupid came between us. I'm not that kind of person! I try to be a loyal friend to every friend I make, and it wouldn't be like me to not be friends with someone over a stupid argument. I just wish he had told me about this and not Tawny, that way I wouldn't have gotten so irritated with him! I seriously thought he was avoiding me!   Okay, I've been working on a bunch of dolls lately, so I'm going to try to send them to you again! Let's all cross our fingers and hope it works! ::crosses fingers::   ::uncrosses fingers and starts crying:: Sorry guys, but it's not working! Again, if you' d like to see any of my dolls, email me at  urlLink melmel12889@aol.com ! Also again, I'll post and tell you if my email changes! I may get a site going where I'll put my dolls up and I'll give you the link, but for now, you'll just have to email me!  Hugs and kisses! I'm goin' to bed!
