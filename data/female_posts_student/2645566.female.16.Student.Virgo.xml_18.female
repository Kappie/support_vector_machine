His little brother wants me to come to their house on Friday for cake because it's his birthday. Paul said that the downside would be that his grandparents would be there. I dont know how that is a downside, but then again, I only met them for a few minutes. I will haveta think about that one.   As for the whole friendship being screwy thing. I'm putting it in the past and never thinking of it again. Its bringing up way too much mess and junk. I just haven't seen Ashley to be able to tell her that....*sigh* hopefully she'll read this and accept my lame apology.
