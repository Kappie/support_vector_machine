If youre a fan of this band youre gonna wanna kill me- it's about avenged sevenfold. the only reason I'm writing about them is because i've never heard a serious fic about them before. Dont worry, its not a romance, the A7x guys are more of... i dont know, mentors for the main characters.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Jillian, I've had enough! I'm sorry but I've had enough!" a sharp voice, full of anger and spite. "Peter, please!" hysterical sobbing.    Mom and dad, fighting again. They seem to be under the impression that just because it's 1 in the morning, no one can hear them. But I sure can, and I'm almost posotive that my younger brother and sister, Raechel and Chaz, can too.   "No, Jillian. Time and time again I've been here, but every single change that occurs in our life, and you start acting up again!" "Peter, I'm sorry, I can't help it-" "Jillian, I've had enough of your syndromes, your disorders, your imbalances! I just dont care anymore! You're on your own!"  It's been 3 weeks now. We've fallen into a routine- I get out of school, pick up Raechel from afternoon kindergarten, and try to get home before 13 year old Chaz so he won't burn the house down.  Why doesn't Mom do all of this? She's convinced that Dad's coming back, and she won't leave her room, for fear that he'll come home and she won't be there. She's too depressed to leave, anyway. That's chronic depression for you.  I don't know who I'm more pissed at- Mom for being like this, or Dad for leaving and making it worse. We just moved to Huntington Beach, I guess that's what set Mom's depression off, which is what "made" Dad leave.  "Adrienne! Mom wants you!" yelled Chaz, startling me out of my thoughts. I slowly stood up from the couch where i had been sitting and walked over to Mom's room, in no real hurry.  "Adrienne, where's your father?" she asked when she heard me walk in. She keeps convincing herself that he's still around, and has just gone out and she can't remember where. "He's gone, mom." "Gone where?" "Who knows, Mom? Probably in some bar, getting wasted. You know he left 3 weeks ago, and you know he's not coming back!" "You're lying! He just went for a walk, because he got in a fight with you! Yes, that's what happened!" "No, he was an asshole and he left, 3 weeks ago. He's. Not. Coming. Back. Face the facts, mom." "Go away! It's a lie! He's not gone, he'd never leave me! Never! Get out of my sight, you lying bitch!" "Mom..." "Out! He left because he was angry at you, you drove him away, but he will come back!" I ran out of her room and out of the house. I sat down on the curb outside of my house, and just as if God whas saying "ha ha, look what I made happen to you!" it started to rain.  I sat there for hours, just sitting in the rain. I didn't know how long i could put up with this. "So, what troubles bring you here?" asked a voice behind me. "Nothing. I'm just peachy. Just perfectly fucking peachy." I mumbled. "Hmm... naw, i don't think you are. See, when i was your age, this curb was reserved for people with relatinship, family, or school problems, which kind do you have?" I just sat there in scilence for a few minutes before i said "Family." "Oh, ok. See, otherwise, i'd have to kick you off the curb here. I'm Zacky, by the way." said the voice, whose owner sat down next to me on the sidewalk. I looked over and saw that he had eyes the color of ice, but didnt have all of the cold usually ascosiated with that color. His nose was pierced, and he was wearing a backwards black trucker cap and a black Misfits shirt with black Dickies. He looked oddly familliar, but i couldnt remember where I'd seen him.  "Care to elaborate? It's not like you have to..." he said after another uncomforable scilence. "It's complicated." i said. "Ok, well if you wanna talk later, I'm staying with my parents over there." he said, pointing to the blue house next to mine. He stood up and walked toward the house, leaving me to think in silence. ~~~ OK i'll continue it later, cos I'm too lazy to finish it now.
