Hehe, but I had my tarot cards read (whatever, shoot me, at least I didn't put carrot cards!) and apparantly one of my friends has magical powers and I don't believe in love but I have some strong views on how the world was created... Which is a load of rubbish really! For the record: Izzy is the only one with magical powers, the power to smell the same bad smell every day for one! I do believe in love! I'm not actually that sure about how the world was created... I just some times sound like I do! Mmm, but does any one believe in that 'the stars tell your future?' I don't. I like to think that in some way we are in control of out life, and just cause some puny planet is by our system doesn't mean that some thing bad's gonna happen! It's stupid to me! Seriously! I does any one really care and seriously do things cause of the stars? Weird!!! Geez, that's why some people become anorexic, because they feel that that's the only thing they can control in their lives. I guess I don't want to feel like that!
