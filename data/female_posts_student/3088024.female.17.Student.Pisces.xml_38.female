I don't know if you know but spring is my favorite time of year.  Well I need to find a job because Bedford is just not fun to drive to or in.  People are so rude.  I mean how much quicker are you going to get somewhere by cutting me off, or honking your horn at someone, or swearing or anything.  Even if you do get there quicker did the ends justify the means?  Why cant everyone just be happy?  I am totally inconsistent with my formatting.  I love that.  Well anyways I am going to apply at Old Navy, and the Gap and hopefully PacSun but I am not quite sure how my mom will feel about that...  I really need clothes and an employee discount wouldn't hurt the cause.  Well today was absolutely the most beautiful day since a long time ago.  I drove with my windows down (and the heat on because an unnamed passenger thought it was too chilly and that he might catch a cold.)  mmm...fresh spring air...bare feet in the wet grass...delightful...well i am off to get work. urlLink Hint Hint
