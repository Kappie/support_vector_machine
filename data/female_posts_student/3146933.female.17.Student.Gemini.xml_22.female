I cried when I found out he was movin to Pensacola..it's pretty sad...but I'll still see him so I guess it's all good. And at least I'll get to vaycay down there this summer!! lol...anyways. I really like Brad..I wish I woulda answered his question different the other day..and that's all I'll say about that haha. But yeah I do like him. He's so great. Havnet talked to him much lately though...kinda upsets me...  Haven't talked to Matt in a while..not that I'm complainin..I msged him one day and he said he was at some orientation thing at alabama so i was like ok or not. Made a new friend too..Brett Harden..he's pretty cool. The last couple days I've talked to him on the phone like average 2 hours...haha...wow we're blabbermouths or maybe I am...and he listens...it's possible! My room at moms..is so pretty..if i know you well, you should ring my cell and stop by n see!  I still need to pick out what senior pix I want for my portfolio...hmm...K well that summed up my week .. not much greatness but that's ok. Maybe this week will be better.
