It just seems easier to let him have his way sometimes, you know? Gotta be strong, Brooke, gotta be strong.       You know what? Family is a beautiful thing. It truly is. If you don't spend time with your family, you are missing out. They have wonderful stories to tell! I helped my aunt move tonight, so I got some quality time in with her and my grandma. I love them so much. My grandma told me about the days when she used to go to TWU, back when they were VERY strict (ever see Mona Lisa Smile? JUST like that! strict curfews, no guys on campus, dresses all the time, etc.). And then my aunt (she's 31) told me about when SHE went to TWU, and you could wear pjs to class and it was co-ed (not that many guys go there), and the guidelines weren't nearly as strict.. it was so interesting! Of course, now I'm exhausted because of all the labor from moving, but it was worth it.
