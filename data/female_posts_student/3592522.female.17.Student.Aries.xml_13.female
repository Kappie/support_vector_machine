Your gaze lightens my heart,  with a click of a mouse  we can be together  our souls closing the distance.   A mexican and german,  unite against the odds,  Promises not spoken,  inside we already know.   Our day will come to meet,  we'll greet with a smile  and we'll never part sides  Our fate tightens with each day.   You are my one addiction  i refuse to leave and sleep  until i talk with you--  My Angel in Mexico.
