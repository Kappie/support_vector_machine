Does it even matter anymore?     Sometimes I just wish you'd die     So my life could be clear.     So I could go about my life     Day to day, Full of bliss, and peace.     But, You've consumed me too much.     And too far inside.     The worms of your lies, pain...     Eat me up inside.     There's no cure for the disease you've given to me.     Maybe someday....I'll finally be free.
