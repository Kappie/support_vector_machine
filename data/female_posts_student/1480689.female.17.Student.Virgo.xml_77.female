I let this happen, it's my fault, and ow i need to fiz it, and i don't have the faintest fucking clue how.  yesterday, i danced, and yesterday i knew that i wouldn't be able to today. my legs, hurt to the point where they feel like knives are being dragged across the muscles. THE MUSCLES... eh. ow. so after my shower this morning i put icyHot on my thighs...it helped and at the same time feels...........rrrrreeeaaaaalllllllllllyyyy weird. cuz now my legs have permanent goosebumps.  but yesterday, mike came over and with no parents home, we just talked. it was nice.   I'm so angry, frustrated, stressed, sad, happy, jaded.  those altogether, suck.
