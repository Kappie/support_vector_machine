The meaning it attributed to my name (though I make no claim as to it's veracity) was "Little Wise One."  Even if this is far removed from what my name means, it is eerily apropos because anyone who has seen me knows I am little (just a hair over 5' tall) and, as anyone who reads this blog can tell, I am very, very wise.  And modest too, though that is neither here nor there.  Then, there was this quote from Proverbs 31:26:  "She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness."  I guess the kindness thing doesn't fit too well - I'm not a nasty person or anything, but I would never describe myself as particularly kind.  But the law thing is kind of strange.  I looked to the whole chapter in Proverbs for some context, and it appears to be about the virtuous woman, which is also appropriate enough.  I'm so virtuous I'm downright prudish. Meanwhile, my name is on top of the thing, which is the weirdest part of all.  For all I know though, they make ten of these with different quotes and meanings on them, so that they will be assured of coming up with some match with everyone.    Then again, Shannon is not all that common a name...
