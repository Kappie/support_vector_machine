Was weird, i got picked up by Jason in his car with Tom at 7.15, and drove to Dave's, we then went to the pub in Redhill and stayed there for a bit, then me and Jason went to Crawley to get Kathryn and her mate as Jason likes her said he'd take her home, then we drove back to Dave's, where we stayed the night, my folks actually let me stay at his when they don't know him etc but they wouldn't let me stay at Jason's for the night when they knew him etc? Pissed me off a bit, thinking of all the sex me and Jason could have had.. Lol! Anyway stuff happened with Dave, kissing and fondling and he went down on me which was really good! Hes really gentle, but for some reason whenever someone tells me like Jason and Tom did that Dave is really into me i feel a bit weird as i don't know if i'm into him as much? We'll see, plus i was too busy trying to eye up Jason's chest.. He spoke about him being annoyed at my parents never letting me stay over and spoke about the necklace he gave me and arghhhhhh...  ~Lisa~
