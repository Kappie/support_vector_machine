Aside from hearing about good reviews for the movie, I also have to admit that I'm grateful that casting didn't put two "pretty-boys" in the roles of Lupin and Black. I've always had a penchent for David Thewlis' acting since "Dragonheart," and of course having Gary Oldman playing Black is perfect. Then again, I've been enjoying Oldman since I first saw him in the deeply thoughtful comedy "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" with Tim Roth. Let me just say, Oldman is great at playing a madman.  Well, much to my suprise, I'll be going to the midnight show (well, 11:59 p.m.) of "Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban." I hadn't exactly planned on it, it just happened. All of a sudden Lloyd and I decided tonight that we needed to see the first showing of the movie if we were going to get a chance to see it at all...and I ran over to the only theater doing the midnight show to get tickets. It was amazingly easy.   I'm thinking of bringing along the digital camera. Although I'm not a Potter fan...I enjoyed the books and the plots although #5 "Order of the Phoenix" could have done with some much-needed editing. I'm not dressing up at all, the only time I've really done any kind of costuming at movie theaters it was for the Lord of the Rings movies, and it was very low-key; I wore my renaissance shirt and a vest and had my long-stemmed pipe in my purse. I'm sure others will show up in costume, though, which is why the camera.  Speaking of such...maybe I'm an odd person, but sometimes I like to go to these events just to watch people. I even went to the release party for "Order of the Phoenix" at the local chain bookstore just to see what all people did. It was a lot of fun sitting around, chatting with others, and browsing through books and movies and CDs. I still haven't gotten around to making Butterbeer...the folks at the store were kind enough to give me the recipie...granted, I'd have to go out and buy vanilla flavoring first.  Well, I need to get going...I don't know when the line is going to start forming, but I'm sure it's going to be early. I doubt even if Lloyd and I show up at 9 p.m. that we'll be the first few people in line...then again, I could be very wrong.  We shall see...
