Line the bottom with parchment paper, butter the paper and flour the entire pan, and wrap the outside with foil.  Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the center.  Melt the butter and chocolate in a double boiler, don't allow water to boil.  Stir occasionally, and remove from heat when melted; let cool to lukewarm (didn't take as long as I thought it would, about five minutes).    Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and 1/4 C honey with an electric mixer for 3 minutes, or until very thick and pale.  Fold in the lukewarm chocolate and then fold in the vanilla and salt.  In another bowl, using clean dry beaters, whip the egg whites till soft peaks form.  Gradually add the rest of the honey, beating until medium-firm peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three additions.  Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top.  Bake the cake 50 minutes until the top is puffed (might crack) and a tester inserted in the center comes out with some crumbs attached.  Cool the cake in the pan on a rack.  Be warned: it falls quite a bit.  Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, remove the sides of the pan.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  So yummy!  Almost a souffle -- so be careful while it's in the oven, don't jump up and down in the kitchen, or it will fall early.
