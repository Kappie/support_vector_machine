Now my room smells like paint fumes pretty badly so I'm stuck on the couch again for tonight. Which really bites because it's extremely uncomfortable and I don't get much sleep. Oh well. Not sleeping allows me to post all of these interesting posts for people to read.       I watched the olympics tonight. I'm really glad Carly Patterson won the women gymnastic's all around. She deserved it. The silver medalist ( would type her name, but I can't pronounce it let alone spell it) was so arrogant and just not very friendly. I didn't like her very much. I felt really bad for the Russian that got 4th place. I hate it when they show the girls crying when they just barely miss a medal. But anyway I wish I could tumble and twist my body into a knot like those crazy people. It's absolutely amazing the insane tumbling they do. I could sit and watch it for hours and not get bored.       I decided I don't like swimming. They kept interrupting they gymnastics with the swimming. I'm proud of Michael Phelps and the other people and all, but interuptting the gymnasts as much as they did was ridiculous. And the stupid commentators make me want to throw my television out the window.       Speaking of my television it cracks me up. It randomly convulses and turns it self off whenever it wants to. It's hilarious especially when people come over and they don't know that my tv has issues. It cracks me up. It's great personal entertainment.       Well I can't think of anything else to that's it for now.      Jesus loves you!
