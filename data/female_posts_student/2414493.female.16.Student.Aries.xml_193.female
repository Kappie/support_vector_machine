The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  I just made love with your sweet memory One thousand times in my head You said you loved it more than ever You said  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  I talked for hours to your wallet photograph And you just listened You laughed enchanted by my intellect Or maybe you didn't  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  Do you believe what I sing now? Do you believe what I sing now? Do you belie-eve?
