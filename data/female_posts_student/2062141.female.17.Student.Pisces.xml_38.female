This song will make you cry if you listen to it. If you haven't heard it, I'll personally burn this CD for you. It's so amazing. After I just read the lyrics, I realized that to understand this, you really have to hear the song. Jason Mraz is totally incredible. BUY IT DAMMIT! I might actually be getting two extra tickets if anyone wants to go with me and Charlotte next month.  PS. Speaking of songs that make me cry, John Lennon released "Imagine" today. Two months from today we'll remember the day of John's death. Love to John~  ABSOLUTELY ZERO Words and Music by Jason Mraz  You.  You were a friend.  You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night You see how it was my fault.  Of course it was mine. I'm too hard at work.  Have you ever heard of anything so absurd  ever in your life. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It is my job to make the most of it Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me.  Not that easy. Hey what's that you say?  You're not blaming me for anything  that's great But I don't break that easy.  Does it fade away? So that's why I'm..  I'm apologizing now  for telling you I thought that we could make it I just don't get enough to believe  that we've both changed. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It's my time to make the most of it How could I ever know that this would happen to me,  not that easy, no All along the fault is up for grabs why don't you have it Well it's for sale go make your offer,  I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero. Well neither one of us deserves the blame  because opportunities moved us away And it's not an easy thing to learn to play  a game that's made for two that's you and me The rules remain a mystery... See it can be easy. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It's our time to make the most of it How could we ever know that this would happen to me...  Not that easy, no All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it Well it's for sale go make your offer,  I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero.
