This clique was form in last year where all the 11 of us were in the same class.When we are separated to different class,we start to have problems.We always tried to solve the problems,even the most difficult one. In the end,i think it just get worst. I always tried to have positive thinking that once all the problems are solve,we will be like last year.The answer is 'NO'. I am too naive to have that thinking.Recently i just quarrel with ying min, i realized that actually i was all along the one who can stand her,maybe still got someone. Val talk to me yesterday,she say she know why i am sad. I was feeling so terrible yesterday,i feel like hiding myself at a corner and cry.From the being i hate to be a chairperson but i became one of it.I am not proud to be one. I dun understand why i must put up with everyone and wearing a happy smile on my face while other people can have so many different types of faces.I really feel very tired,ying min yesterday msg me some message of friendship.I cry this morning when i read it,why because i didnt expect her to sent me.I admit i feel much more closer to ying min,bel and corthen the rest but i feel more hurt when i got angry with them. I dun feel regret to be in this clique as i always say i am so unlucky with someone i dun like to be. I did tried to accept her but she just cheated me again and again.I really dun noe how to trust her. You all may blame me but i really cant take it anymore. No one understand how i feel now...    My dad friends just passed away on thursday night,his friend dote on me since i was young i really dun understand why she got to die.I canttake it anymore since one by one who i really love just leave me. I feeling lonely as really lonely .
