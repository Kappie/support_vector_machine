I imagined that I went to the Prince concert last night instead of sinking into my bed, windows open, crickets chirping... I had this amazingly sweet moment with my "boss" the other day, where she told me that I did excellent work, and would go far because I had instinct and was smart. It was nice and something that had not even thought about much. I guess not too many people come through and offer free technical services that are actually satisfactory. But also, I've never really thought about what "success" is or what "going far" means to me.  Anyway, the "successful" part of my morning consisted of sprinkling cleaning dust and elixir (aka ajax and comet bathroom disinfectant) on various surfaces, picking up a vacuum from boy's house - ugh, he had just come back from princess' lair and volunteered info about his non-sexual relationship, ugh, i swear i didn't ask - and making rental car reservations! So I'll pick it up tomorrow, pack up my things and leave bright and early Thursday morning.  It'll be exciting to make this journey alone. Though sometimes, I wonder how much I'd really be able to say to myself before I got bored.   VOTER REGISTRATION IN PHILLY.  In other news, talked to my friend, Brandon, who's up in Brooklyn. He wants to promote voter registration/ celebration/whatever up in Philly - using young adults of color - because PA is apparently crucial territory for defeating Bush this year. I might be passing through to see him and have that discussion about how we might coordinate this event and have it complement existing efforts. Does anyone have suggestions of prominent political figures who might want to be a part of such a thing? I can provide more info if anyone is interested...
