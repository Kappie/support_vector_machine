Well today I woke up really late, because Jake doesn't have to get up early anymore to go to work out, because they have it in the evenings now. So when I woke up I took a shower and started some laundry and cleaned and got dressed. Then I decided I would go get my schedule and some gas, but I stopped by Royal Pizza first to see if my check was in. Well it wasn't so I got Danie's DL and a note so that I could go get her schedule for her. I went to up to the school when Steven called me and asked if I wanted to go eat with him, Jen, Chase, and Jared. So I left and went to get gas and then was on my way to Burleson. Well when I got there everyone had ended up leaving except Steven because I ended up having to go to Royal Pizza and home before I could head out there. So I went back up to the school with them and headed out to Jakes before he had to go to football practice. When I got there I ended up getting a little show from Jake and Brandon...lol...I dont know what Im gonna do with them. But when they finally get good then I'm number 1 back up dancer...lmao. So then we left and I came home to get some stuff done and realized...life is way to short to give it the cold shoulder. You gotta live, you gotta forgive, and you gotta grow up. Tonight is gonna be fun, I'm gonna get ready to go to the carnival to watch the baby contest and wait for Jake to get there, maybe I'll get a hold of Lauren or something. So I decided today...It's stupid for meaningless things. Till then, Later Days.
