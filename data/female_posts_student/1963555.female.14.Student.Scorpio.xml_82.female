I'm cool with it, I don't know if I wanna mess with it... yet. okay that was gay. anyway, what's up? UGH I'm sleepy. Oh tonight for dinner my dad was out, and my mom made cheeseburgers and she had some jalopino peppers in the fridge so we cut a peice off and put it in the cheesburger and didn't tell my dad. So he comes home and takes a big bite of it and burnt his tounge. ha ha it was so funny! he was like "you evil bitches!" but he was joking, it was a good one....
