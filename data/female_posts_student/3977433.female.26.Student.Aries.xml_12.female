I wouldn't mind the extra hours, and I know he doesn't come in often so I won't bitch too much about it. Hah.      I guess posting things about my weekends and nice things people say about me, are going to be used against me in some twisted way, so no more of that. It's illegal. I'll stick to the more mundane stuff. Maybe I will start posting how many times I pee. There is a difference between posting things that you MIGHT be doing for the weekend vs. trying to make someone jealous. I see it, why can't you?       It's raining here and I'm soooo tired. I am hoping to find someone to go to breakfast with, and then nap after. Yay, most of my day tomorrow is off. Aaaaand it's HUMP day. Double yay.      Have a good day!
