"the alchemist", a book I read yesterday spun me tales and stories about ideas, values and morals. I guess to believe in the present and to do what you feel like doing ultimately leads to your future. So if you want to sleep, you sleep. Feel like eating, you eat. I think that holds some truth.  every action taken today defines the future you have tomorrow.   I'm really thankful for everything I have in my life. The sudden appreciation, made me really glad today. I guess it boils down to how aware you are of your surroundings and the loved ones that care. =D I'm glad I opened my eyes wider.  I wanna tell the whole world how wonderful your life is, if you led a purposeful life. Remember this?  " I'm on the top of the world looking, down on creation and the only explanation I can find. Is the love that I found, ever since you been around, your love put me at the top of the world."    that goes out to all my sisters and my dearie Joshie!
