But Six Flags was actually kind of cool because I had money Meaning that I was able to get on rides     of my choice with the FAST LANE PASS. It was so awesome because people were all...     "ooh..they have fast lane passes." and i was like shyeah. But it was cool. And Junior actually called me. It has been FOREVER since HEs called ME. It was sweet really. yeah...
