I have to go on Lupron Depot to get rid of the endometriosis, which is like a monthly shot, and it sort of makes you, well, menopausal...yeah, I know. Weird. Then I have to go on Actonel to counteract the bone loss from Lupron, and Zoloft to counteract the depression. Lovely, just lovely. And I'm supposed to get hot flashes n shit? Wtf. I thought you only had to go through that shit once in your life. Haha, ahh gayness. And my mom and I both got a good laugh (later) after my doctor was like "you can't lay down for 30 minutes to an hour after you take Actonel because IT WILL BURN YOU"...Ah blah blah blah.  Anyways, then I worked, and then I went and drank some. I have off today sooo...I think drinking is in store.  Okay crazies, catch ya later.
