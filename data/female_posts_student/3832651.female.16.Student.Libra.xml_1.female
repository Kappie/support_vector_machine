(actually its almost 1pm- i missed the morning cause i was sleeping, but jordan and briton so kindly woke me up at 11:15am with the loudest most obnoxious phone alert ive ever heard lol)...yeah, so im in kinda a weird mood..i guess cause we're leaving on wednesday morning and i still have alot of stuff to do..and since im the queen of procrastination, things i could have done awhile ago i didnt do and now its all kinda stressing me out...i still have to find someone to fill in for me at nursery on sunday cause ill be gone but i cant get in touch with anyone, i have to talk to josh about camp (i told him about how i wanted to go the last half cause i would be gone till the 3rd and he said he'd call me but i forgot to tell him im leaving wed morning so i have to call him today i guess, and its so last minute and thats probably not going to go over well with my dad, so if you think of it please pray for all of that and that it all goes smoothly), i have to pack/clean, i have to do summer reading (dang, i havent even gotten the third book i have to read yet!) and do the reports on them, just alot of stuff and im really stressed out...uuugghhh, i kinda wish we werent going out of town, but im kinda glad that we are, i dunno...so yeah, saturday i worked 1-5pm and then hung out with steph, she came over and we went to moe's for dinner (soo good!) and then went to britons and watched this standup comedian with him and jordan and travis, then went to rachel kuhl's house with her and micah and played ping pong and N64 for awhile, then steph spent the night and we woke up to her car covered in oil, saran wrapped and covered in kitty litter, which was alllllll over my driveway and she was late to church and i spent 45 min trying to clean my driveway...it was the guys and their "O.R." (aka, operation rachel) and they TPed rossin's and rachel k's house badly as well...hm, then sunday night i went to core with steph, bethany, lauren mills, megan f, and her cousin and it was really good...then steph and i said we wanted to go to taco bell and like half the youth group ended up going (we are such trend starters lol) then we went to lindseys house with travis, briton, jon, matt, greg, michelle, and nikki and played spoons and poker..it was a fun night, and today i dunno what im doing, trying to unstress myself i guess and get some things done...pray for me! have a wonderful day! :-D
