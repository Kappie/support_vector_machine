Love isn’t love ‘til you give it away.”   “Follow your heart and you’ll never get lost.”  'Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without, someone you you fall head over heels for, love is everything everyone lives for, Love is Life!'  *If you look down on others, you turn your head down from god, but by considering yourself lower than others and serving, you always have to look up to people, which guides your eyes towards the heavens.*  *^*It takes 3 seconds to say *i love you*, 3 hours to explain it, and a Lifetime to prove it!*^*  ^Meeting you was fate,  being friends with you was a choice, but fallin in love with you was beyond my control.^  #You don't loose by loving, you loose by holding back.#  One day I asked you whose life was more important, yours or mine?, You said mine, and I walked away not knowing that you are my life!
