I love this quote because it is so true.  It's easy to have our own opinion when we are by oursevles but when we're in a group it is just as easy to conform to their opinions.  But a truly great person is one that can keep their own opinions and be true to themselves even in a large crowd.    I woke up feeling like shit today.  Came to school even though I was sick.  I need to learn!  I felt better after lunch though.  But I fell asleep when I got home, did some Algebra, took a shower and ate something b/c I wasn't feeling well again.  My mom suggested that since it worked earlier in the day.  I have a 100 temp.  UGH!  I hate being sick!  But don't fret my friends I will be in school tomorrow unless I'm like throwing up or something.    I'm getting really excited for Lizzie's party on Saturday!    Lexi told me today that she was reading my blog (Hi Lexi) and that I seem very different on it.  I thought about it and what I write on here is what I think and at school I'm too polite and my parents have taught me better than to say these things to those people (When I talk about people).  I type them here so I get them out.  But I do believe that what I say on here is closer to who I am than who I am at school b/c I'm not afraid to hold back on.  But I would never put something extremely bad on here either.  Now I'm sorta contradicting myself. Oh, this brings me to another Emerson qoute: "To be great is to be misunderstood."  Maybe I'm just misunderstood?  I don't know.  Bottom line: Lexi is right, I am different on here than I am at school.    Oh, I am tired.  Time to go to bed.    P.S. Newspaper was a fun day today.
