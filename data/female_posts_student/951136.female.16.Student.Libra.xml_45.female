ALANAH NEEDS TO GET A BRAIN TRANSPLANT b.c. she's gorgeous and perfect the way she is and what she said is WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so wrong. unbeliveably wrong. i can go and sign a petition by all the guys against what you said girl, and prove very EASILY that your wrong. and why the HELL are you making up shit like that! if anyone everybelvied that about themselves it would be worse than catherine mcHan AND her sister combined. i'd never once consider that. i'd never want to. and the truth is on the opposite spectrum of that. and i'm glad. thats the way i like it. Life is GOOD. great! go go eat some chocolate cake! ....come to think of it, we have some sitting in the freezer....mmmmmmmmm
