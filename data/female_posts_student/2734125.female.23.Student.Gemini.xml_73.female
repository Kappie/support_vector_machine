There is a courtyard in eddy, which is filled with grass and trees and plants.  I had noticed on my way into eddy that there was a subtle buzzing noise in the courtyard, and when I went out I found the source.  I laid under a tree with falling pink buds and a hundred bees zipping around it.  The hum was comforting, and I watched the petals fall onto the stones, coating them in sunrise colored snow.  While I was there the sun came out, and illuminated the tops of all the branches, heating the flowers just enough to release a warm smell of honey.  No wonder the bees looked so happy.  I watched a bird three feet away from me eating mites I couldn't see out of the center of a flower and the edge of the branch.  The bird was unaware of me, seemingly unaware, and I watched it breathing shallowly.  I let flowers fall on my body, and wondered at the moment.  Now I am trapped in a cold, dark lab...
