Thinking back at my conversation with Yuko that night, i wouldn't have thought that i could meet someone who actually had the similar bitter experience.......she never tell me a lot of any sad story about her....the only few times that i can recall now is John, Tas and her grandpa's death....it seems that she'll only let it out if there's someone who's utterly close or important to her or else, she would keep it to herself emotionally. Again, 'thank god' for answering my prayer....i really know that i found 'the penpal' that i'd wished for from the first day i decided to write!  It's the photo that i pasted on my new DIY photo album.....i recalled exactly the moment i took that pic with Oscar, it is still so unreal that he left me......Aug 5.....today is a year and 4 days since the last time i saw him......my heart still ache so much that whenever i think of him, my tears bud will just loose it's inhibition......how unfair it is that he is not living any longer......i don't know when it will be the day that i can really accept that he no longer alive.....he's still very much in my heart.....i still ponder at the i did not get to see him off............sigh....
