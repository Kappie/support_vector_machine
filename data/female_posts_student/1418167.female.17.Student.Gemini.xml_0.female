Too bad the dinner hasn't worked out yet. Maybe someday, huh? I hope you had a good birthday. And you may have the first Shrek CD but I am getting the Shrek 2 CD for you somehow so we can blare "Hero." I saw interviews from it the other day and it made me remember how funny it is all over again.    Next movie recommendation:   The Terminal . Very, very good movie. A bit long, but overall very cute. However, if you have not seen  In America , I will drag you out of whatever location you are in and place you in front of a TV with a DVD player so that you can see it and love it.   Muhaha  . My evil plan for the world- to make everyone watch a movie about a poor Irish family in Hell's Kitchen, New York.    ANNOUNCEMENT:  My favorite band of all time, Five for Fighting, can now be played on my blog. It doesn't come in very well as of yet, but it will be perfect bait for you to go out and buy  The Battle for Everything , their newest CD. Or you can get  America Town , the CD which features "Superman" or  Message from Albert... , their first CD. I got their autographs when they came to Memphis when I was 14. OMG it was amazing as well as my first concert. So, in order to show the genius of John Ondrasik's lyrics, here is the chorus of "If God Made You."    Sunset sailing on April skies Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes I can't say what I might believe  But if God made you he's in love with me   Happy Birthday, mon ami.
