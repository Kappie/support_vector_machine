Maybe I could send you some pictures of me getting baptized. Love you so much! Steph"  My niece is so cute! :D  Today wasn't a complete waste, even though I didn't make it to the conference. First, I went downtown with Suriyo. I got some cds. We went home and I met up with Emily 'cause we decided to go to Broadway. On the way there, we saw Shanelle and Eric at the bus stop. I haven't seen her in the longest time! Things are okay with her...and Curtis. She got her cell phone shut off. Her phone bill was a thousand bucks. AND I thought my bill was a lot! XD  Emily and I didn't do much at Broadway. We got some incense and had dinner at Torrero's. 8-) Them quesadillas hit the spot. We met some weirdo at the bus stop. He called me over and told me to look at his ID. He said to look at the DOB. I did and it said 08/08/1963 (how do I remember these things?) and yeah...he was trying to show me that his birthday's tommorow. I was like, "Hey, that's great." We got on the same bus and he sat next to me and Emily. He asked us if we were going clubbin'. I said we're too young. Then he was like, "Then you're too young for me..." He started talking to the girl he was sitting next to. He asked her how old she was and she said seventeen. He started laughing 'cause  she was not seventeen. More like twenty three. I felt bad for her. She was blushing and she did not want to talk to him. He came back to talking to us. He said, "You must be Filipino and Samoan. I can tell by your cheekbones." I told him I'm Thai and French. He did not understand so I got in his face and said "I'M WHITE AND ASIAN." He was like, "Woooo, hold on, girl!" :D I wasn't getting no attitude...he was too drunk to understand. Just making myself clear. He started saying some other shit and no one could understand him and I was kinda fucking with him. I was like, "What? Huh? Say what? Whatchu say?" I totally confused him even more. He got off the bus and I wished him a happy birthday. What a character! I think he's homeless, though. =| Will I ever see him again?! :( I'll remember him by his hair...and maybe that cup full of change he carried with him.   Ahh, I really like my new cds. Wish I had enough to get a few more. I've been wanting to get Daydream Nation and Surfer Rosa for the longest time.   Mission Of Burma-"Outlaw" Cool shit. 8-)
