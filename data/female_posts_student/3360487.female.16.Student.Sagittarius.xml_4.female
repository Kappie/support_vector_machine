Oh, and here's the best part:  they tagged the picture as "seductress." *rolls eyes* Yeah, whatever.  I had a dream last night that I got a 4 on every AP exam and I was happy about the compsci and the bio and calculus, but depressed because I thought I got a 5 on the english and that ruined it all for me.  God I hope I'm not that picky in real life.  I don't think I can wait until the scores come out in July.  Back to biology work, I suppose.  Anybody want to help me with how the juxtamedullary nephrons maintain an osmolarity gradient in the kidney and use that gradient to excrete a hyperosmotic urine?  Ew, vomit.
