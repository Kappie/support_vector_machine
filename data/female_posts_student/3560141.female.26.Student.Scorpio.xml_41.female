Ok...demonstration of fickle-ness number three thousand and four.... On a construction site in the middle of a fully functional hospital, didn't know this filled health codes, but I guess it's all within regulations...the old cliche of greasy construction guys cat calling women needs an updated more perverse version...I find myself two feet from some man in kneeling before his century marker on the life ticker, who thinks that incessantly turning his power drill on and off is somehow supposed to make me think of making sweet love to him right there in the elevator.  Oh, but the kicker...he's licking the three hour old mash potatoes off of his crusty lips, so what...so I could feverishly make icky squishy in my underpants...NO....he proceeds to place the drill near my ear and tell me that he would love to do things to me...like what build me a bird house, lay some pipe...oh god....I wish if I did have a feverish overwhelming feeling it would have been because I, either slapped the potatoes right off of his face, stuck the drill up his nose hole making him devoid of a midbrain, or lastly jump on him and returned his sexual aggression because we all know half the enjoyment is the power issue and the other half is knowing that an aggressive woman is no longer attractive but psycho....  And yeah man, my new roomate...well, no matter what I try to wear, short of a turtleneck, if I catch this guy fixated on me pouring cereal into a bowl or using the remote control once more, I'm going to ask him to leave...well, at the end of this month, on a fixed loan income, we all have our price....He's never been within this proximity of a girl like ever...poor guy....I should be empathetic and I think that's where I stood about two weeks ago...but now, on top of today....I feel like putting pork in his figs and almonds...  And Poopie pants, my patient, the youngest patient on the ward, cute round chubby boy about twice my size, ok...he has a liking for turnovers....tickled me...like reached behind me, a woman more than twice his age, who is his professional therapist...says i'm cute and have I ever heard of a blow job....I walked away....to find him a few hours later, giggling....again with the blow job business...I flipped..some therapist right?  I said, "Noone here is nice to you, I try to treat you like a normal kid...like respect you, and you talk to me like I'm some kid on the streets...I'm more than two times your age, show some respect...and that's it, this is all very inappropriate and I'm not talking to you anymore...."   I'm not talking to you anymore...this is my response when me and my little brother fight...this is my response to kids who called me names back in grade school...this is my response to a psychologically disturbed 12 year old boy who poops in his pants....I apologized...We worked on our "boundaries"....but after today....or tomorrow when he's discharged...I'm not talking to him anymore.....  I'm never wishing for anything anymore, not when a penny falls into my palm near a well, not when candles are being lit on my birthday cake, not when Shaq appears as my genie...never...Oogled by cute boys, with big hearts, and sharp wits, totally different from an oogle just to oogle...I'm more self conscious...I avoid eye contact...I'm repulsed to be honest....so, after today.....
