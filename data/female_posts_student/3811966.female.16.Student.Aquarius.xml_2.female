Went to school for only about 2 hours today, as I'm still having my mid-yrs, due to the opening ceremony. Think I'll most probably fail my Physics, so as usual will fail science too.  Since school reopened, I've been home very early everyday, mostly before 11am, due to the exams. But even after that, I've decided to come straight home everyday after school. I've given myself a time-table, and hope that I'll follow it. It'll begin next week, when my exams end.  When I come home these few days, I'm all alone, except for my Dad who's sleeping in the room. There's no one for me to talk to. Hence, I feel scared and frightened and lonely. The feeling of emptiness comes, and I feel that there is a part of me that is missing. And I think I know why. I miss  DANCING  ( Ballet  to be exact). I miss the weekly lessons, and the 2 times that I performed with Frontier Danceland. I miss the " big sisters " and " little sisters " whom I performed together with. I can still remember their names and faces, but I doubt that they still remember me. I've kept all the stuff related to the performance, including the schedules. I found the pictures that my mum took during rehearsals and the actual dance too. After seeing them dance on TV the other day, the feeling has grown even stronger. I really miss them. I found Frontier Danceland's website a few days ago, and also saw Kay's website. I really admire her since then, but I've never told her. I dream of e-mailing her, and telling her that she's my idol and all. But i don't think she'll even remember me in the first place. I've sent an email to Frontier Danceland, hoping that I can contact my teacher, Ms Loke, but I've yet to receive any reply. I'll wait a few more days, before I pluck up the courage to email Kay to ask her instead.  I really   hope   that I'll be able to go back to dancing again. It's already been  1.5  years since I stopped ballet due to academic results. I can only go back to classes at the end of this year, after I take my O'levels. I hope I still will be qualified to dance, and that I wouldn't be rusty. Hence, I've started doing stretches and some steps before I sleep every night.  I was thinking, if I didn't choose to go to ECH in poly after I graduate, (which is my other love and dream), would I be able to take dance as a course? Can I go towards the ARTS direction? I could combine  my 2 greatest love ,  Ballet  and  kids , together, and that could be my career in future. I could teach Ballet. I don't know.  Right now, all I want is to go back to classes .  Oh well, think I'll end here for today. Bye!
