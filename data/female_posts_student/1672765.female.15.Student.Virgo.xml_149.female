Cheer up! Just keep in there, you guys! That goes out to all of you, anybody reading this (nobody) if you're feeling down it'll be okay. It'll always be okay in the end. It may have been better but it could have been worse - either way there was no way of knowing so be happy with what you have and just move on. I've noticed that alot. And something today really helped me clarify the idea and think about it more. Well, not that in particular, but happiness in general. It's not caring what other people think. I used to be so uptight and I still am, really, even if I don't want to be. It's just the way I am, I can't think too quickly in social situations and I clam up but then right afterwards I know exactly what I should have done and it would have been okay. I'm working on it. But anyway, the more relaxed I get about how other people see me or think about me the better I feel. It's so radical...you probably think I sound so cheezy or whatever...but it really does feel like a weight lifts off you when you just stop being so concerned with what everyone thinks of you.  Where does it get you anyway?  I don't know why I used to worry so much, I just can't find any reason and maybe now that I'm older I can see, finally, how pointless all that was. But, like I said, I still get caught off guard all the time. Old habits die hard or whatever. The thing that happened today...I used to think these certain people...I thought I wanted to be like just like them or at least just be a part of that crowd, or be seen like them. I don't. I don't know why I did. Well, I know why, but still that was so stupid and worthless. At least I didn't ever pine away at the thought of it or try so hard to be like them or whatever. I know some people do that and I feel sorry for them. I'm glad especially, though, that I can see right through them. They were talking about stuff like they were so into it and so up on it or whatever and I just wanted to tell them exactly what I thought...but they probably would have hated me for it.  One of the things they were talking about...they just follow trends...but they say they don't or whatever...you know those people...? Like, "Don't dare label me!!" But it's okay for me to call you a prep or jock or whatever and stereotype and judge you. That's just fine.  I never get a chance to be around these people at all, this is one of the first times. So this doesn't really have much point at all, it's not like they were including me or anything or trying to get to know me. I am nobody to them. I just happened to be sitting next to them during the placement test.  I'm still on the outside. Still the outsider and loner and loser.  I am so fine with it.  And if you think I'm something else, I'm fine with that too.  If you want to think I'm poser for wearing something then that's fine. You're opinion of me doesn't make a difference in that respect because that opinion is nothing to me. You've never even talked to me? You have nothing to go on. How stupid is that? I wear what I LIKE. That's a lot better reason than what some people give like "It's cool." or "It's punk." or "It's gangsta." or even those who wear things just because everyone else wears them and they want to wear what everybody else wears. That's fine - that's cool that you do what you do. I'm fine with you doing it and I think it would be nice if you could be okay with what I do but that's okay if you don't. Because I don't care. I'll always be the pathetic quiet girl that gets strange looks and that suits me just fine because I'm being me and that's all anybody can do. And that's all anybody can do to live their live to the fullest. You know that expression - "live your life to the fullest." So many people sit around and moan about how pointless life is or whatever. Instead of being so depressed about it - why not just try and make it worthwhile? That seems so much more logical to me, don't you think?    Music: Love Buzz - Nirvana
