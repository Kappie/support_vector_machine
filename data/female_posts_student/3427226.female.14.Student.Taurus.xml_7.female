Story Overview:   Every two thousand years, hell is unleashed upon the earth to curb the expansion of its living creatures. The year 2005 is that very year. Now mankind will have to fight the army of darkness, before darkness claims the land they had once ruled over. But unlike the past generations that have fought for their survival, this generation has one major advantage...They have discovered the existence of magic. Despite the fact that only 40% of the population has the ability to wield magic, it still gives them a large advantage. The only problem is that the new Wizards are starting to feel superior to their "weaker" human counterparts, who are unable to wield magic. This will only lead to trouble within the ranks as now the "squibs" are starting to feel that their kind are being used as "Calvary folder" and are being killed without reason. Now the "squibs" must chose their side. To fight for humanity or for darkness.
