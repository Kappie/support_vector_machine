Anyway, Sara was also online, and it seemed she had written a new chapter of her fiction, so I read that. (I must just compliment Sara on her writing ability, it is very, very good).  So, anyway, I went onto Avidgamers (www.avidgamers.com) and then onto my site. (www.avidgamers.com/WOTE); which is a roleplaying site, after answering the many posts on there (wasn't actually that many...I replied to most of them last night), I then went onto the other sites I had joined.  And then, my mother asked me who Marc wants to ask out, and I said, I don't know, why? She said that he had said something about it in his blog (I do actually know who he wants to ask out, but let's not go into that, I have already advised him against it). So I went and saw his blog, and decided to make one of my own.  Now, I ask this question. Who the hell is Flip? Weird...never heard Marc talk about anyone like that before, oh well...and I thought it was he and I who have 2 hour conversations? It's not my fault that I don't sign onto MSN that much, or only do so to talk to the people who are on my sites, about that sort of stuff. Anyway, enough about that. Today I have to go to the post office to get my half fare pass, and will be going soon. I might post here later on.  Bye.
