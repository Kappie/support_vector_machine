I actually got my eyes checked a couple of hours ago, and I am at the moment temporary BLIND!!! They dialated my pupils, and boy was I hurting driving home. Come to find out, you are actually not supposed to drive until your pupils become of normal size because it screw up your depth perception. But, it's o.k cause' I got home in one piece. Thank God it's Thursday! Seriously, Thank God! See, I don't have school tomorrow, so for me Thursdays are like Fridays for most people. Hehe, Finally got g-mail... Man, was it hard to come by. Well, until I figured out you could buy one for dirt cheap. Well, time to do laundry, whoop-dee-doo!!! I wish clothes were disposable, wear it and throw it out after, so that there would be no such things as laundry!!! I'm being lazy... So what!! The gang is supposed to meet up this Sunday for a picnic for fourth of July, I wonder how the plans are going. hmmmm......       I MISS MY DAD!! I haven't seen him in four months. I actually had a dream about him last night. I wish I could remember my dream. I hate when I can't remember. This girl in my class last semester said that you should have a notepad on your nightstand, and write whatever you remember of your dream as soon as you wake up. It sounds interesting, but when I get up, all I can think about is going back to sleep....       My mom is going to yellow-stone national tomorrow with her friends for three days. I hope she has a lot of fun. She must be so lonely by her self at home. She's been alone for a week now since Hong-mee left for Korea. I hope everything goes well with her I-20 thing. Oh well, we'll have to see what happens.        22 More days left  until I become an auntie!!! My sister-in-law is having her baby on the twenty-third of this month... I seriously cannot wait! I am gonna be the best auntie in the whole-wide-world!
