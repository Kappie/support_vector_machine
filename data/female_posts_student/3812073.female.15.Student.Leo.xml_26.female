I once boarded this SBS bus whose driver greeted everybody when they boarded, and greeted them goodbye when they drop off. Not many returned his greetings, but i was greatly impressed. He waited for those chasing the bus, and yet greeted them with a smile instead of the usual cursing.   This man changed my perception, and made me realised  a little do go a long way.    i wrote him a thank you note, and the smile he exchanged with the note was priceless.   that's what happiness is.
