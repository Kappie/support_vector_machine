I'm trying to decide if I'm going to write the title down here, because I'm not sure how comfortable everyone is with the subject, but if you want to know, just ask, and I'll be happy to tell you. If you're a boy reading the post, lol, well, let's just say, think twice before asking, because I wouldn't want to destroy my "Nerdy, but nice" image. Not ready for that, just yet. Lol! What a devil I am!
