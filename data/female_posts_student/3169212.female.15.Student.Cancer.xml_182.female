But I don't come here today as a famous actor, who happens to be really  really  handsome, I come here today because I was invited to this blog, which I've read through and let me just say I find your views on death very offensive. I mean it's bad enough that I'm dead, but for you to rub it in my face like that, it's just mean. Anyway, I've been sporting this light blue armor since my days on Sidewinder, and now I spend my time at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, in the Blue Army... Obviously (blue armor).
