Something in the air reminded me of youth and happiness and flirtatiousness...and it almost made me sad. I just stood still for a moment and I breathed in everything around me...and it made me miss the way things used to be. Then I was just kinda sad for the rest of the evening. There's something missing in my life, and I wanna find it. And then I watched the sunset, and I thought of love, and I watched everyone around me; so happy to be with someone...and so I stood alone and just watched everyone...and it made me sadder than before. But...not truly sad. I tried to smile, but I just let out a sigh instead. It's not a depressed sad...it's more like knowing that there is so much out there...and realizing how much you want something that you've never had before. Something........you don't even know what, but you want it. You want that happiness. I mean, have you every been so happy that you just sat and smiled...and nothing else mattered but the moment. And you could feel the sunshine on your face, and it was so wonderful...and you noticed every little beautiful thing around you. Personally, I have. Not everyone has, but I'm sure many people can relate. Well, I want to feel like that. Forever.  "I'm a hopeless romantic in a male chauvinist world."
