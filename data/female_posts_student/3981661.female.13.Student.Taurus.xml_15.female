Yea its stopped -.-' As you can probably guess I don't like storms ^.^ I don't mind rain. And sometimes thunder is ok. But I reeeally hate lightning. And if its really really windy then I don't like it. But I like wind. *looks at what I just said* Riiiiiight. I sound weird ^_^  I feel like posting lots of pictures!! So I will!! ^.^     I don't really know what that means, but doesn't that guy look cool!!! Lmfao I'm so weird ^-^  I haven't draw anything for ages -_- I should really start again. Mabye I should post some of my pictures in the gaia art arena. Hmm, but then again I wouldn't want people to say that my pictures are bad xD People always say my pictures need shading *cough* Ricky *cough* I'll do shading when I feel I'm better at it. xP  More pictures!!!     Lmfao!!!!!!!!!  I forgot how cool Reno is from final fantasy 7. So I tried to find lots of pictures of him on google but only afew came up -.-' But I did find this picture of the turks ^.^     Lmao!
