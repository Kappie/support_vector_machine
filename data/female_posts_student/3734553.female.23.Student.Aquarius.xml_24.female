Jake's bakery rocks. We were definitely on a sugar high during the drive home this morning. made up for time lost yesterday, the hour and half drive in under an hour.  Rockstar and Groupies party tonight. We're definitely rockstars. Four girls in my tiny apartment is way too many.  Houston is more fun than I thought.
