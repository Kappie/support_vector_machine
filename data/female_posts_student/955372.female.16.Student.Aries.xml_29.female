So our plan was to go down to the acme dressed in all black and execute Operation double cc (i can't explain what it is, if i did i'd have to kill you, sorry). So i'm walking over to madeline's house dressed in all black, and she had to borrow black pants, so i was bringing some over for her. It was raining and I didn't want to get them wet, so I thought "hey why carry them normally in a plastic bag, when i can freak people out" So I put the sweatpants under my coat to make it look like I was pregnant. It was hillarious! All these old women were tsk-ing me. And everyone in their cars were like staring at me. Oh god, it was most entertaining. And all the cars let me cross the street first, it was amazing. When I got to Madeline's, her mom looks at me and is like "oh god" and i'm like "don't worry it's just sweatpants. Madeline was laughing pretty hard. It was great. Yeah so then we walked down to the acme, but we pit stopped at the pet shop, of course. Cute little puppies! And like everyone was staring at us and we were like, umm ok. But then we realized it was because we looked like we just came from a funeral. But there was this one guy, I think he was like sixteen or something, and he kept like following us around, and we're like um, yeah lets go to acme now... Well before we went we watched this sad little kitten for a while. It had been like ostrasized. I wanted to buy it just so it would be like loved. I felt so bad. But I couldn't buy it, sigh. (1) I didn't have any money (2) my dad is allergic and drugs are apparently below him. jackass. Anywho so we go to Acme and more people stare at us. And we tried to execute operation double cc, but the enemy got there first. So we played with the cookie dough for a while. That was amusing. Then we got ben and jerry, Vanilla Caramel Fudge, mmmm. And we bought a pack of plaztic spoons to eat it with. That was pretty funny. Then we walked home and it was scary, cuz it was all dark and so bloody cold. Yeah that was basically my night. It was tres amusing.
