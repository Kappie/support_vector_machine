'When my wife got prego, my fantasy turned to lactating breasts. I waited nine months, then finally convinced her to let me try it. I started sucking and at first didn't get anything. I put all I had into it and -- bam! -- milk started streaming like a small hole in a hose right to the back of my throat. It startled me -- the taste was super dry and didn't taste quite like the milk I was expecting. There goes that fantasy.' "
