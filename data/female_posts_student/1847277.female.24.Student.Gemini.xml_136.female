But it's nice to be happy about the world-- even if my birthday was forgotten by the general population (okay, that's it- I'm done being bitter about it now).   And I have this strange fluttery feeling in my stomach, as if something exciting is going to happen. I've gotten lots of emails in the last three days.  But I've sent loads and loads, so I guess that is to be expected.  But me + emails = happiness.    To the bones!
