It's not really a big deal to me, never has been. So here is your invitation to "talk it up"  So yeh. Today Matthew and I and his mommy went up to Franklin together, we had a good time. and I FINALLY got to eat at Matt's fave restaurant. So now i'm sitting at home on a SATURDAY night, because...yet again i wasn't invited to do anything...if there was anything to be done.   -tori
