Kinda like, ya know, you knew everyone else felt the same way.  On the road however... jeez, there were some people who were driving w/o a care in the world.  Just on 1604 and Walzem alone, I was almost hit 3 times.  3 times!!!!!  The one on Walzem was the worst... I was right next to the guy... I mean, not even in his blind spot or anything... and he started coming over into my lane from a turning lane.  Thankfully no one was in the lane next to me, so I merged over for a brief second to avoid being smashed on my side of the car... Then when I glance in my rearview mirror, I see the man (who was older... much much older) driving at about 20 mph.  20 MPH on WALZEM!  (people who live in SA know where Walzem is and know that for someone to drive at 20mph on Walzem is just pure CRAZINESS!)  Anyhow, I got home, and I decided to take it easy till later when I go to a memorial service at my church for 9/11.  My first class was cancelled for tomorrow... so I think I may just sleep in and not leave here till like, 10ish... of course, I may not be able to get a parking spot... So I may just end up going really early, and I dunno... Catching up on my readings for World Civilization.  We'll see.  Okay... this post needs a comment from Ricky... and right SPIFFY comment, at that...  the other one probably still needs a Melissa comment, though I dunno, cause I haven't checked it yet... But I would venture a guess that she hasn't yet responded... because she's been busy responding to other stuff... like email and IMs... hehe  :-)  But before I end this email.. has anyone else noticed some people not really joining into the rememberance of 9/11...?  Just wondering if it was worse in some places than here... or better, even....  LinktoComments('MANUAL')    urlLink Comment
