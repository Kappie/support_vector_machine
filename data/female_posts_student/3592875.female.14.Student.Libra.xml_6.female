I mean there's "best friends" and I have a couple of those...Well ok like one * urlLink madi blye * but I've always felt like I want that one special  guy friend  (no more than that) so I can ask him questions about what guys think and what would he do in a certain situation with a girl, ect. I can do that with my best girl friend but but not in the same way, if you know what I'm saying?   Is there even such a thing? Is it possible to have just a "best guy friend" I mean help me out here, do  you  have that special friend of the opposite sex?   I thought I use to have one, but then...I lost him to highschool...I lost him because of my own personal feelings, I blame myself though. I've been looking for a  replacement , someone like him. But I've found that threes no one that could be like him, that could  be . Okay now I'm making myself even more depressed. Lets move on to something more up lifting....   I love all my friends, I just wish they new how much I did. Here's some of my favorite friendship/love quotes that I wrote and didn't write ^_^   A friend is someone who understands your past, believes in your future, and accepts you today just the way you are.     A friend is a person with whom you dare to be yourself      You never lose by loving, you always lose by holding back.      If someone betrays you once, it is his fault; if he betrays you twice, it is your fault.     It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives
