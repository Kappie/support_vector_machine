I have been working away at my masters project with noreward or without seeing any thing being accomplished. Which gets even an eternal optomist like me down.  and then  Something goes right. I don't have the data to back the observation figured out yet. But that will come with time. But the observation was so stunning that if this trend continues it has the potential to change me life path! Which is crazy on one side, but on the other it means I find myself questioning things that I though I had figured out.  I feel like I am trying to decide between two of my favorite things. Both will result in a life where I think I'll be able to achieve my dream but...both are SO different and both are mutally exclusive. So How do I know which one to chose?? How will the decision affect me? Where do I go for this kind of advice?
