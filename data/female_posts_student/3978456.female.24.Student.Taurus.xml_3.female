This genius got up in a meeting and expounded on how war is a naughty sneaky vehicle for racism. His boss, sez he, is way concerned cuz of "the disproportionate number of latino-americans that will be sent to war." Funny - i missed the memo where we reinstated the draft. To apply to minorities. Also, my all-time fave Congresswoman, Barbara Lee (CA 9th, Bay Area)besides being the  only  Member to vote against retaliationagainst Al Qaeda immediately after 9/11,had this to saywhen asked about Iraq: "War is always bad, becausethe children die." (And I'm kind of paraphrasing, cuzI don't remember her exact wording, but that was basically it, guys.)      Wow.      Note:I only bash dems cuz it'z like shootin fish in a barrel. That being said, it also makes me feel better about myself because i have, like, one other reep friend. All tha restare dems. My bestest friend, bless her traitorous heart, workz fer tha DNC.         Oh yeah - on tha flip side, Orrin Hatch iz beginning to closely resemble the second cousin of the AntiChrist.
