Why can we know the joy of feeling a love so strong and sure and right that it nearly crushes our bones with it's intensity.  And then the next moment we're alone and abandonded, every breath is a laborious task, and we cry and cry and cry and don't know what to make of ourselves.  Why is it that I can be doing rounds in a hospital and see someone one day, they're chipper in spite of the breathing tubes and IV's and various pokes and prods from someone trying to make them better.  Or even if they're not putting on the brave face, they're cranky and cantankerous and in pain and lashing out at everyone around because they're scared out of their wits and can't control anything that's going on and their family cares - or doesn't - but their attention or apathy can't do a damn thing to help you.  And then the next day, I'm saying the Commendation for the Dying over them.  Or holding their widower as he cries.  Why is life so fragile?  Why are our hearts and spirits and minds so prone to pain?  What is the good of this.  Forget all this "better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" crap.  Shakespeare didn't know what on earth he was talking about.  Is that line any consolation at all to the woman who buries the person she thought would be her life partner and then he's gone 3 weeks after the wedding?  Or is it any consolation to the couple who celebrates their 47th wedding anniversary in the hospital and she's wondering if it's selfish to want him to live to the 48th because he's in so much pain.  And even if you live to a ripe, old age and feel relatively happy with the life you've led as you cross the bar -- there's always  always  the sighs that come with you saying to yourself, "I could have treated that person better.  I could have spent more time with this person.  I shouldn't have rushed to judgement against that person.  I shouldn't have trusted that person with as much of my heart as I did."  Sighs and tears and still no closer to an answer.  And I'm not really expecting an answer, from anyone or even from God.  I don't know what I'm expecting - other than light and dark (whatever each may symbolize) in proper, hard-to-understand measure.
