The acoustics in the building kinda suck... alot... and my ears are ringing more then normal. We'll see how it goes.  I stumbled upon this band, and this song which I am truely loving.   Crooked Fingers: A Little Bleeding  You say you came to save the day But now it's evening And all your victims have gone home  You claimed to take nothing away But you kept stealing These things you could never own  Last night I drove to go nowhere at all And came to the saddest thing I ever saw A pretty girl all strapped up in an ugly car Driving through a shady crowd of criminals  Truth comes in waves leaving no trace Or any meaning To all the bad things we've done  True hate won't wait and love comes too late Into this evening Into this night so dark and cold  Last night I drove to go nowhere at all And came to the saddest thing I ever saw Another pretty girl inside an ugly car Driving through a shady crowd of criminals  A little bleeding A sinking feeling The victim I would never know  Copyright © 2000 Red Pig Publishing
