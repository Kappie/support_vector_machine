It seems he unleashed his fury on poor Florida. It is a little windy and hard rain is coming in bursts here. No worse than a thunderstorm, I suppose. I still hate hurricanes, it literally paralyzes our entire area and we somehow end up wasting yet another day doing nothing. I think our entire town is shut down today (lol). Not to mention, it's my dad's birthday and we're stuck at home. It would have been nice to take him out to dinner or something. I guess we can make up for it tomorrow.  Now allow me to rant.  National news channels and the Weather Channel crack me up when it comes to hurricanes. FoxNews has been covering the storm all-freakin'-day. If I see anymore images of Punta Gorda, FL on TV today, I may scream. Surely that can't be the only town that has seen devastation caused by the hurricane. Some woman from the Red Cross told the FoxNews anchor that this is the biggest relief effort since 9/11. What?! How exactly does one begin to compare a tragic terrorist attack to a natural disaster? That doesn't make sense to me.  And I am so sick of Floridians who cry over Hurricane Andrew to this day. They act as if they're the only ones who've ever been dealt catastrophic blows by such storms. Give me a break. In 1999, Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina under water, but that's the 'cane most people like to forget in favor of their prized sob stories over Andrew. Ugh.  You know what's worse? Because news channels and such are based in NJ, NY and D.C., they like to go on and on about how a 'cane is headed their way. Um, okay, you're going to get some wind and rain and you're rushing out to the store to stock up on food and water when there are people in Florida who are now homeless or DEAD? Are you kidding me? It really makes New Englanders look weak and silly. Come down to the Carolinas or Florida and ride out the true brunt of a major hurricane, then let me hear you complain about some wind and rain.  Anyway, I'm done ranting (it felt good). :) You know what? I'm happy. After reading my apology in my previous post, my friend and I started talking again and things are back to normal. I knew the cold shoulder, silent treatment wouldn't last long. We're inseperable, yo. This is for you. ;)   Ashlee Simpson -  Pieces of Me    I am moody, messy   I get restless, and it's senseless    How you never seem to care   When I'm angry, you listen   Making me happy, it's your mission   And you won't stop till I'm there     Ok, enough with the mushiness. You get the point. Baha. Um, let's see, what else is happening as of late? I'm starting classes on Wednesday. I have to drive to NB (don't want to say the name of the town here) for Biology class every Monday and Wednesday night until December. It's a 20 minute drive or so, which also means I'm going to be spending more money on gas.  Sigh . I guess it's the price you pay for higher education. I think the Intro to Ethics class should be interesting; too bad it's only one night a week.  Can you believe a woman I work with asked for my fall semester schedule so she can tell me when I should come in to man the phone? It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that she is using me to take more days off. Nevermind the fact that I really don't enjoy talking on the phone, and the last time I did go in for this, I got rude calls. I could just imagine how much they'd dislike it if I decided to take next Friday off (my birthday) so I can enjoy turning 18.  A new copy editor was recently hired and I met her yesterday. The same woman who asked for my fall schedule also introduced me to my new coworker, saying that I "type stuff up" for the editor. Gee thanks. I do a lot more than that, but whatever. Technically I had taken the position of copy editor until the new girl was hired.  Speaking of which, I think copy editing is what I want to do (at least at an entry level position) when I start hunting for my first job after college. You know, for the last four or five years I've been set on majoring in journalism, but after doing a bit of research I started having doubts. I'm spending a lot of money and putting a lot of effort toward going to college and getting my bachelor's degree, only to go into a disgracefully low-paid field in which I'll receive just enough to get by in a small apartment and my barely-paid-for Toyota Echo.  Journalists do a thankless (and horribly underpaid) job. Not only is it thankless, but those in the field are often accused of being biased, slanting the news, showing favoritism towards one political party or the other, etc. Talk about shooting the messenger. And the newspaper business is dying. The general population is relying on TV and the internet for instantaneous news. Newspapers are having to lay off their employees in some cases.  Double sigh .  Aaaaanyway, I think the only thing I have left to say for now is a note to  Mira . Thanks for the comment you left on my last post (that is, if you were being sincere. I feel you were though). :) It was very nice -- unexpected, but nice nonetheless.
