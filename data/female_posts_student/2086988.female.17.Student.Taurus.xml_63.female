But, it was the way the state trooper treated me that really pisses me off. I was nice, I gave him my license and insurance, and I smiled and I nicely asked him if he could let me off with a warning, I told him I had this huge grauation test to take and that I didn't need this on my shoulders. What does he do? Ignore every fucking thinG I say, and gives me the ticket. At least I don't have to pay the ticket, I just have to pay $25 for the defensive driving course, but I still have to go in front of a judge none the less. But, once I read the ticket I had realized that he put down a "M" under the gender part. Yeah, last time I checked I didn't have a dick and that I was a female. I'm sure he just made a mistake, but the fact of the matter is, it offends me and yet the ticket is still VALID. Stupid fucking mexican can't fucking read and tell apart genders needs to go back to fucking mexico. Ok, yeah, I'm being racist, at this point, I don't fucking care. It's the principle. I've always hated cops, especially state troopers (childhood incident) even though a lot of my family are state troopers, they still can go fuck themselves. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, EMPHATICALLY HATE STATE TROOPERS. And all I have to say is that when I go to court, the judge is going to get a few words. Yes, I have a big mouth, but I don't care. I have a good arguement. If the cop can't comprehend the difference in gender and in letters, then how can he tell if I was speeding? It's his word against mine and he seems to be a dumbass. I nearly said to him, "so how much commisson do you get for this?" I'm sure that wouldn't of started anything. So in closing I hate asshole state troopers, DIE.     Today I woke up and you were gone  The whole day wondering what I did wrong
