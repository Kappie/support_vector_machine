It was odd, i have not been like that for a long time. I have not felt the absence of God so sharply or known so completely that I am not part of Him. I knew, i think i have always known. You know how people reckon that we are all sons and daughters of God? Well it appears i am not. The God who is all merciful and love showed no care for a child of the shadows whose face was wet with tears and body convulsing with silent sobs. When i am a mother i will always ALWAYS help my children, hold them when they cry, i would not turn my back on them.... do you think God could be arrested for neglect? Ah but i forget, He is not my father, that has been made clear. A child of the shadows can only be a puppet of that evil one.  ~Aine   urlLink www.mesmerisation.blogspot.com
