(The 2 topics never to bring up at Thanksgiving dinner)  It was spawned by Bishop Sheridan in Colorado Springs stating he would refuse communion to people on the basis of whether they vote for pro-choice, -euthanasia, -death penalty candidates.  Which, on the whole I do not support.  But then again, I surely don't agree with the Bishop on this particular point.  It becomes very dangerous to judge people in any circumstances, much less the level of their "sinfulness" which is such an internal state that it is difficult to see what lies within the hearts of others.  This is also assuming that all Catholics vote on the basis of "moral" platforms.  (I'm also one who thinks it's foolish to simply vote along party lines) While I'm not a fan of the death penalty or euthanasia or abortion, to be perfectly frank, it's such a small part of what I look at when I evaluate a candidate to govern for and on behalf of me.  The problems with these particular issues is that while legality makes it easier to condone each of these things, the actual change has to lie within the hearts of the people who go out to attain them.  I could go on, but I'm sure that I've already put up enough to create a minor maelstrom, and I won't have a chance to come back for a few days.  That's also assuming anyone's reading this.
