My first thought was 'hey, that's a cool bumper sticker' because, hey,  I  love pure maple syrup too. A  lot .  Then I began really rolling it over in my head. I started thinking 'what kind of fool  buys  this bumper sticker?'  I entertained fantasies of these really super gung-ho tourists and their sticky-pawed children buying the stickers , then actually sticking them to their cars. I imagined the locals laughing at them from their spots at the cash registers. It just seems like a silly way to commemorate a vacation to Vermont. Especially if you're from Massachusetts. Not exactly a distant land. I laughed and thought 'stupid yuppies' or some other classist remark against the wealthy (it's only because I wish I were wealthy that I think such things).  Ahh yes, but then I thought some more. I noticed the kind of truck it was on, beat up and rusty around the edges, with an ill-fitting cap. I could easily imagine that truck driving from maple tree to maple tree at the first thaw, tapping trees and hauling barrels of syrup around. I think of people  living in an eternal, wintry spring, where the rest of the year goes by in a blur and there are only three seasons: before tapping, tapping, and after tapping . Crisp, Vermont air, blue jeans, flannel shirts and dirt-drenched, sticky, sappy hands. Ahhh, maybe it's a local pride thing.   And still another level deeper, and I started thinking that maple syrup makers (are they technically farmers?) might be going through some hard times economically. Tourism is down, people are cutting corners, yadda yadda. Maybe the owner of this car is trying to raise awareness, to help create the desire for pure maple syrup again,  to whet people's appetites and invite them back to the syrup houses to get a fresh batch .   I thought about the fact that none of the cheap maple syrup in mass distribution actually has any maple syrup in it. Maple  flavor , yes, most likely chemically derived. But as far as I'm aware, Aunt Jemima and the like are all maple-flavored substitutes. How sad is that? Maple syrup doesn't even have maple syrup in it. And that people go for it anyway!!! People buy it- mostly because it's cheaper than the real stuff. So  actual maple-syrup-makers are being driven out of business by companies who don't even  make  maple syrup . What a slap in the face to the craft of treetapping. Although many actual-syrup companies are in wide distribution and you can find them in most grocery stores, when people are saving their dollars (which so many people are doing everyday esp these days) they go for the cheap maple-flavor because it's pretty tasty, too, and the real stuff is much more expensive. Who doesn't want to cut a corner and save a few bucks when they can?  I have a soft spot for real maple syrup, especially the darker ambers which are so sweet and sappy but also rich, dense and earthy. It's really a gift from the gods that trees give us this stuff (or that we have learned to take it) that is so yummy and lasts forever (if it's old just heat it and scrape off the top harmless moldbubbles) and even contains a bunch of healthy minerals. I think it's a decadent treat and then I think, no, this is nature as it is intended. This is what people ate before there was 'maple flavor', this is what people lived on. And what a shame that these natural gifts are now 'specialty foods', luxuries that only the well-off and the farmers who physically make the stuff can afford to eat.  How cruel to be economically shut out of eating food that is actually made of food ; how cruel, too, that people who make the stuff can't make a living wage without charging more than many are willing to pay. It looks like a lose-lose situation, so who is winning in this situation? As usual, I think that prize goes to a distant boardroom.
