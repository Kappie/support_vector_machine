The ticket seller, the popcorn butterer, but especially the ticket checker, for not stopping me from going into the Harry Potter theater and forcing me to see The Day After Tomorrow again. It started like any normal movie swapping, we bought tickets for one movie, and arrived on time to see Harry Potter instead. Then, things became unusual. Instead of stopping us from walking into the wrong theater, the ticket tearer simply shrugged it off and continued ripping those tickets. Next, as we took our seats in the worst possible place: the very end of the very front row, we were surprised by the lack of security. Unlike the average Houston theater, Starplex Cinemas of Lake Jackson didn't have someone roaming up and down the aisles to make sure everyone had their ticket stubs. Strangely, we were undisturbed the entire time, and didn't even see someone checking people's tickets. So, thanks Starplex Cinemas. I couldn't have done it without you.
