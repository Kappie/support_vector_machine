I watched the first four episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho, Ghost Files. It is incredibly funny! I sniffled a bit in the first episode though. This is sooo wierd...I just noticed how I skip from topic to topic. Mucho Crazy. And Tsubasi No Baka Isn't answeriing his E-mails! I could strangle the twit! *Deep Breath* Okay, I'm calm now. Have  a Nice day!
