My mom said it so clearly that if my sister didnt let me have Nibby we might be able to get one, and her words were "they're not as expensive as the other animal that you want." That's saying..'we can get you one'..AHHH! My sister doesnt want me to have Nibby, only because she thinks I'm too young to take care of him. 6 feet? My wall is BIGGER than 6 feet..I dont live in a closet!  Yet, I have all these feelings and all these things to say....all to be kept inside of me. My words mean nothing when they're not heard. My voice is heard...but the words that my voice sounds out,  dont .     I have failed .:you:.
