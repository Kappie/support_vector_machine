And Helen and I had a D, it was really cool and nice. She gave me a Bible too :D I'm reading Mark right now.  I talked 2 a lot of people, and I finally found out y Ernie is called Ernie from Tom. It's something about Earnest Prayer. Haha, and Luke gave me his long john's to  turn into Speedo Joel merchandise, I'm gonna give them to Hannah W on Tuesday at school. I kinda felt bad last nite because I didn't help pack up, cuz i left at like 11, so they were already packing away, and Pip L and Tim B and KC and I just made more mess bi pushing down chairs and stuff...hehe :P Overall it was a REALLY good night! And damn Gemma 4 missing it, she's gonna be paying 4 it later ;)  hehehe, Beth
