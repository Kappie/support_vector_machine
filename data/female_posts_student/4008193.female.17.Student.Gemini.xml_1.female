I went out to my friend lizzy's house to see my friend zak who moved away but came backfor a visit. it was sad because he DIDNT REMEMBER ME!!! after a while he seemed to remember who i was so that was good.   we all went to pirates cove and then didn't stay long...we went to see a girl named karen( i don't know her) she worked there.   after pirates cove we went to walgreens to buy some cameras for a remeberance stuff.   we went back to lizzzy;s house and hung out for a while....my mom called on my cell and asked where i was..she said she couldn't hear me she i repeatede being a lizzy's like a million times then she was like oh ok bye then...affter like an hour my dad called and did the same thing.   after a few hours we ordered pizza and it was fun....then we played spoons ..i was REALLY good or atleast i like to think so..   so then i left and got home and called my best friend shannon...she came over we hung out and then i had to go to work...   some people (costomers) are dumb and they were horrible to deal with today.   after work i went to get shannon becuase she is sleeping over. we went to see I, ROBOT and it was good i dont know what some people are taking about.   ok well that's all....i have to go now!!!1   BUH BYE ALL   LYLIMT
