If you haven't read it and like to read...I would suggest that...its not just a book to occupy your time, it also is a learing experience in the making. Some of the things might go over your head in the beginning but they all tie together. Yes I have been reading that book instead of my summer reading...but im sure the book is a million times better than my summer reading books...and im getting way more outta the book than i would get out of "As I Lay Dieing" I mean come on...that book will probably make you wish you were dead instead of reading it. After bible study was over Tyler came over...i hadn't spent time with him in a while...so i really enjoyed that. And that is about all that happened on my eventful Thursday.
