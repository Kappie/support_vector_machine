Why cant i get one of those? arent there sexy, brilliant 15 year old poets out there somewhere? i want them!!!!! i could use a boyfriend... meh...my love life...now theres a sad story.   ah, now im watching shakespeare in love... yay. the romance.  oh, had an interesting conversation with jessica yesterday...i wont get into it, but i thought this amusing: PangMasterJayJ: But to be honest, if you haven't told me last year that you weren't gay, I probably would've started wondering about now... haha...as i write about how i find fiennes attractive...  okay, i have nothing else to say, so im going to post this. gotta watch my movie, right?  heres a picture of the very good looking mr. joseph fiennes:
