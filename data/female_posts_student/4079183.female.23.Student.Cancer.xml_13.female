Yet this people never agree with what I write but continuously view my blog... Do these people have a lot of time on their hands? I know I barely have enough to just turn my computer on. I am glad that I am not one of "those" people. I am also glad that I do not see an argument in everything that I write, it is merely a comment or a "blog" written by me.
