I created buletin boards all day, spent most of it alone as my CT(cooperating teacher) had to be downstairs for three lunch periods to recruit baseball players out of the droves of freshmen.  After that, came home, and almost fell asleep, took two asprin, and rode into the city for dinner with a buddy of mine.  Saw his apartment, nice location, and in-house laundry is always a plus.  Got invited, then uninvited to a party friday.  I understand, and really I should be doing other things like resumes, grading papers, planning lessons, sleeping, etc.  Beer doesn't help my head of my figure, no hurt feelings whatsoever.  But who knows, plans are always changing with me.  Oh and yeah my mom was in the hospital today, outpatient surgery, women problems, she's fine and that's all I have to say about that.  However, other friends and aquaintances aren't apparently so lucky.  Leslie, still in isolation, anaphalactic shock due to attempted meds, not cool, but she's doing ok right now.  Through the grapevine I hear of another person, elderly, who's health is an issue, my heart goes out to the family, my prayers are with them all.  My stress level has tappered off a bit, very good, I was getting worried for a while, but I was assured of the normality of the situation by several parties.  I don't think anyone is using the Bears tix this weekend, damn bridal showers, I wanted to go, but alas not to be.  I'll just have to catch the second half on TV.  I think that's it for now.  The students arrive tomorrow, not worried about my content knowledge so much anymore, more so about handling classroom management, it'll be an experience.  I guess that's it for now, goodnight.
