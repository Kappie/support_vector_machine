Which means I got 71! =)=)  I'm going to Kent Ridge Park tomorrow for CIP (Community Involvement Programme) and have to report to school at 8 a.m.. `Bleaugh. When I thought I could sleep in late tomorrow. I'm involved in the drama performance on Tuesday, too! Ms Wong saw us and was giggling away. o.O  We were totally `xiaswaying Ms Leong just now.    "Ms Leong, we love you!" "Ms Leong, we support you forever!" "Ms Leong, wo men yong yuan ai ni!" "Ms Leong, we will miss you!" "Have a good trip home, Ms Leong!" "Ms Leong! Wo men yong yuan zhi chi ni!!!"   Haha... She was like "EH?" and then went:   "Yes, the whole school knows you will miss me." "Yes, yes, my loyal supporters, I will love you too!"   So cute. =) And so is Ms Ng... I got her favourite book home. Before she allowed me to take it, she was all like:   "Remember, I want it in perfect conditions, no bends, scratches..." -- Ms Ng "Ms Ng, I treat books like friends so don't worry. If anything happens to your book I'd buy a new one for you!" -- Me   All the teachers are so nice. =)   Ms Khoo: "Sihui, I'd expected you to do better." Me thinks: "WTF?" Me says: "Oh, um, because the day was together with the maths exam and I was concentrating more on maths... *nods solemnly*" Ms Khoo: "Ohhhhhh... That is so sad for you..."  *Dies laughing*  She is so gullible. Mwah. And no, she's not a young teacher (Like Ms Ng, Ms Wong and Ms Leong). In fact, she's an old maid. Who is biased with boys. And doesn't like girls alot. =) So... Explains why I was lying through my teeth. Haha.   Oh, and Ms J's getting married on the 6th of June. I'm on her priority list for invites. =) The only student too! Now, if only Ms Wong would get married... *Winks* Yeah, I won't even mind being a flowergirl. Like for Mrs Howard.  =( Speaking of Mrs Howard. She's leaving Singapore for good. 30th of June. I was really sad when I heard the news. She was my English teacher, and I'm considered close to her (Hello? Flowergirl?) and well... =) I hope we'll keep in contact!  Anyway, I wanna go sleep. Adequate rest is important, ain't it? ;)
