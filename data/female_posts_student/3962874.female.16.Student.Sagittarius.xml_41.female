Know what I realized? I am really getting fat. I have gained quite a bit of weight in the last year and a half. Okay I'll tell my secret. I'm on the pill and I think that's why. No it's probably not but yanno might as well blame something right? That and I am very lazy. Anyway I have to go to the femanine doctor this month sometime so I think I might switch to something else. Any recomendations? Yea, it's too bad I dont' really need it that bad cuz Daniel and I don't hump like rabbits or anything. And it's hard to remember to take a pill every day! Okie Dokie. Need to do workout.
