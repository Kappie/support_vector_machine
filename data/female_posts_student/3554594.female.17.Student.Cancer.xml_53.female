It requires... hard work, courage, and maturity. It requires... honesty and trust, respect and consideration. It requires... good-will and good-faith. It requires... sharing and caring. It requires... each to communicate to the other their needs. It requires... dialogue and mutual understanding. It requires... the embracing of both endings and new beginnings.  Ongoing hear to heart talks... are also a requirement. Thus there was the need for me to give you this poem. For in this moment... This is what I need from you.
