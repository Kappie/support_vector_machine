The track kept on repeating n so were my tears. it is a sad combination of music n wat i m reading... jeez... really dun wish to type any entries today... I'll pray to be strong. i'll pray for u. i'll n i believe tt He will lead u to the right path of life. i trust Him. i noe tt He will take gd care of u, thus i m letting go of this emotional burden (or actually trying to run away from it). i really wish tt i can help but i noe it's out of my ability (n i also noe tt u wouldn't want me to care either). well, even though u don't want me to tell u to take care, i still hope tt u can take gd care of urself no matter which route u r taking.
