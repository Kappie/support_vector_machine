Not that I'm any sort of super genius, but I am wicked determined, and with enough work/practice, anything is possible, right?  But whenever I would venture to say that to anyone, they would mock me and come up with something like "Well, if you wanted to be the kicker for the Packers, you couldn't do that,"  and I would argue that I could, but obviously that wouldn't have been true.    I don't feel the same way now.  I think that was a happier time...
