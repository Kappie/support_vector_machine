I was the last to publish during the minute of 32 in the hour of 1!!!  Yesssssss... happy diabolical days.  Latin time, latin time....   I should make a song about Latin time.  It is my own personal theory that I will fail Latin time because I have an A, and therefore have an unhealthy habit of avoiding schoolwork under the excuse that one assignment couldn't hurt my grade THAT much.  Sadly, accumulated zeroes can do odd, negative things to a grade.  This is a lesson that I wish to avoid at all costs, but I'm afraid that I've already been educated.  Whether I actually pay attention to my lesson is another matter entirely.  BUT WHATEVER, it doesn't really matter that much.  I mean--- NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!  Now I feel bad.....  I was THINKING and so didn't see Tyler (was actually unsure of whether I was too annoying to talk to-- damn my insecurity problems!) and he was... "grrr".  AND SO NOW I FEEL BAD.  Crap.  I am in a state of either perpetual guilt or... *cough*  You know.  Not.  Wow, see?  Case in point.  Must cut Tyler open and retrieve brain.
