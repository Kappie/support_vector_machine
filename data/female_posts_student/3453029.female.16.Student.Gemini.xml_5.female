The preview is being played a lot lately and I finally decided I wanted to read the book b/c the preview is so breathtaking and some parts make u smile, but it also makes you wonder which guy the girl (Allie) will choose.  Will it be the one that's the right choice...or the one she's *meant* to be with?  I couldn't take it anymore so I decided to buy the book Monday night.  Right when I got home I started reading it.  I couldn't put it down.  Just within the first 20 pages, I had already cried at some parts.  I think I read until it was 12:30 in the morning.  I had to make myself stop and go to bed.  Right when I woke up the next morning, my nose was right back into the book!  I finally finished it last night.  Tears were flowing down my cheeks.  It was one if not *the* sweetest, breathtaking, and unique books I have ever read!  About an hour after I had finished reading it, the preview came on and the tears started falling again!  LOL!  You can't help it after you read this incredible book!  Now, I cannot *wait* until the movie comes out!  Me, Laura, Emily, and my mom will be at the very first showing!  We can't wait!  So, if you're looking for a great and sincere book to read for the summer...get The Notebook! But, beware...it *is* a major tearjerker!  "The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy.  In my mind it's a little bit of both, and no matter how you choose to view it at the end, it does not change the fact that it involves a great deal of my life and the path I've chosen to follow." - Noah Calhoun, The Notebook (a novel)
