It is a give and take relationship and it is nice to know that if things fail in life, we have each other.    Then I am reminded constantly of the wonderful friends I have...of course, Heidi who has pretty much gotten me through this rough year...I mean not very many friends fly out thousands of miles with family to come and see you...there aren't very many friends willing to do that.  I am so blessed with her.  Then another good friend who has always been there, but I sometimes neglect with my busy life...but still remains friends with me...Curie.  When I was dealing with Bailey's condition she is the one who helped me through it and kept reminding me just how strong I really was...well she has some happy news for herself that I won't share with everyone.  Just know girl, that I love you and am so happy for you.  I have wonderful kids...very intelligent and beautiful children who I adore more than anything.  I have a husband who loves me completely and will move heaven and earth to see me happy.  I have a mother who drives me nutty, but loves me and more importantly my children more than life.  I have an uncle who is more like a father to me since my father is never around anymore.  He provides all the love and support I lack in life.    I am just so happy to have such wonderful people in my life and for the first time in a long time I know completely how extremely blessed and undeserving I am to have all this love surrounding me.
