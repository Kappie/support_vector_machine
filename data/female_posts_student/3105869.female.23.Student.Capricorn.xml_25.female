I have covered debtor-creditor, the bulk of the course, in depth and in tiny writing, but my best writing so doing it took over 9 hrs so far.  I am glad my visiting family has made it safely, but I am just sick they are there when I am not, AGAIN!!  This has now happened twice and next time the schedule a visit I BETTER BE THERE.  But on a different note, I just got word from Mimmy that  Maurice´s wife died.  I love him soooo much it just hit me like a bag of rocks, I know I am tired and a little worn down from finals, again, but this just sucks that I am not there.  He IS OUR FAMILY.  He took care of me all the time when I was sick and he has done as much, or more for my great grandmother than many of her blood relatives had.  What a tragedy.  I feel like a schmuck for not beign able to go to the funeral or help him or SOMETHING.  I´m crying right now, in the internet café from Spain, where I can do nothing.  Please extend yourselves to him, he has for us.       I leave for London on Tuesday.  I have figured out that the first train of the day leaves here at 5:47 am for Madrid, where I will get off at Chamartin and change trains (using my eurail pass for free, on the second leg) then go to Valladolid, Spain, arrive around 10:30 am, then make the trek to the airport, which is apparently far away, and I have to check in three hours early!!! Forty minutes before the flight they actually reject people from boarding!!! Then I will get into London after my flight leaves around 2:45 pm sometime around 5:30-ish I think.  I am still staying in Piccadilly, and Monsigneur Anderson will be in London also on the 3rd, so he asked if I would like to see Harry Potter with him in London!!!! Of course!!! So if anybody has more London sights I must see, please email them to me. I am getting nervous, and excited, but mainly just nervous about making my three million connections on time.        The older front desk lady here came up to me this morning early as I was writing my final and said she wouldn´t see me again since I leave tues, she gave me a hug and said she wanted to give me  "dos besitos"  she´s so sweet she has become my friend.  I almost got upset, so she said if I am ever back in el escorial I always have a place to stay with her.  Good things still happen I guess.
