Blogs are pretty pointless... well, for me it is. i don't post about anything worth looking at, so why continue? i don't think anyone really needs to know what i'm thinking about. let alone care. so this is goodnight, have a wonderful life.     A Song For The Moment      This place rings with echoes of Lives once lived but now are lost Time spent wondering about tomorrow I don’t care if we lose it all tonight Up in flames, burning bright Warming the air of the world  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Since I’ve taken your footsteps Getting me closer to what is left Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know Within my bones this resonates Boiling blood will circulate Could you tell me again what you did this for?  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Still I wait With a hope inside of me (inside of me) So still (so still) I wait (I wait) Until again we meet Until again we meet  Within my bones this resonates Boiling blood will circulate Could you tell me again what you did this for?  “I don’t love you anymore” is all I remember you telling me Never have I felt so cold I have no more blood to bleed As my heart has been draining into the sea  Still I wait With a hope (so still) inside of me (I wait) So still (a hope) I wait (inside of me)  Rise Against -- Blood To Bleed
