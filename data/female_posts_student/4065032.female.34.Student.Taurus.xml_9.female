After weeks of sitting outside, I have come to appreciate the various colors of yellow. I suppose it is because the dullest of yellows appear brilliant against the backdrop of green.  A day or two after the barn swallows left, my new neighbor planted a bird feeder on the edge of the mini-ravine that outlines the property behind the apartment complexes. The feeder is a fairly lengthy, narrow cylinder capped with a yellow top. At first, it appeared to be a bit too flashy for its surroundings, until the goldfinches found it. Now, it dulls in comparison to the tiny creatures eating the contents within. All of the shades of yellow dull in comparison to the finches' feathers. The petals of the brown-eyed susans take on a more brownish hue. The warning sign on the bike path indicating a left hand turn even seems brown. Yellow butterflies are more pale than I remember them.  Yes, the brilliance of the goldfinch drains all other colors.  The goldfinch, Iowa's state bird, is a fascinating creature. I watched two in flight this afternoon. They flapped their wings rapidly twice or three times, and then they glided for a bit. If they left a mark in the sky like jets often do, it would be in a casual, hilly path. The math side of me is reminded of a stretched sin curve. The artist part of me is reminded of a child drawing mountains on the horizon of a picture. Unfortunately, the goldfinches are very busy creatures and don't feel the need to stick around for very long. They do, however, remind me that you don't need to flap your wings continuously to get where you want to go.
