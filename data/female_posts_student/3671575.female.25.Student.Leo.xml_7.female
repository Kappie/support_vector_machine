An article on MSN gives a guide for any single woman who attends a wedding alone, as if we are too weak to do so without directions. As if we are too pathetic to attend a public event by ourselves. Perhaps we are stretching the softness of women a bit too far; we can actually do things by on our own. They offer advice on clothing and behavior; however, I am most disgusted by their “how to” section on answering that dreaded question that apparently makes us wither to the ground, alone and pathetic: ”Are you seeing anyone?” I am horrified that we need to make up excuses, is it embarrassing to be single? Is it a contagious disease that other people flee from? Should I hide in my room and take to my computer to read up on all the “how to’s”, so I can make sure I hook myself a real catch. Then I could be the envy of all the other wretched singletons out there, hiding in their closets with "how to" books. Then I won’t sink down into the morass of singleness. Then I’ll be complete and able to attend a wedding with my head held high, because I won’t be alone. As if being alone is something bad. What if I enjoy my own company? What if I am comfortable in my own skin? Does that just make me intimidating and too controlling? It seems to me we are damned if we do and damned if we don’t.  Perhaps the media could pull their heads out of their asses and find something important to actually report. Wouldn’t that be a treat?
