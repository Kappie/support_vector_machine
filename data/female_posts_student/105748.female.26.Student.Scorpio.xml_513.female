Don't worry, you'll find another job soon! With you talents, I doubt that you will wait too long to find a job that you like. When one door closes, another one opens so keep your head up and enjoy your extra time with Brian and Hobbie! :)    Min:  Welcome to Goldensushi. Feel free to blog here with us as much as you can. It'll save me some money since I don't have to call you long distance anymore (hehe) :). BTW, thanks for the background for my blog. My weblog looks even better now. :) Much love to Ashlye for me!
