Dilemma two, would be that in our eyes, we have done nothing this summer. i have pretty much sat around, watched tv, sat on the computer, worked a little bit, taken a college astronomy class, taken an alg. class, mowed the lawn a couple times, tanned, saw my mom for a month, and....saw my boyfriend. woo. thats not much to me, so im very disappointed, see this is my   last summer before my senior yr, then next summer i have to prepare for college   . so, i feel old, and unaccomplished.       2 weeks....what can a person do in two weeks to make themselves feel accomplished? well, what do i think i need to accomplish before school starts? i think i need to buy my school clothes, but i can't do that unless i work my ass off uber bad in the next two weeks! so cross that off. do something exciting? well, trapt is playin at a state fair in sioux falls on aug. 8th....but i doubt me and brooke could go there for it, although it'd be really fuckin awesome.      maybe its all psychological...seeing, now that i read all that, it doesn't seem like those really make a person more accomplished. they sound materialistic. i guess i need to get over it, b/c other kids have wasted there summers on even less things then i have around here...      well, good post brittany!! ((clap clap)) horray, im expressing my feelings... i feel allot better.
