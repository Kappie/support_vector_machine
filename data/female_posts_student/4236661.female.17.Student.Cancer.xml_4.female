Amy and I kept on emailing each other saying things like 'omg i'm so excited'... 'blah blah blah' etc. lol!     finally 4:40 came (i had a little countdown going in my mind and i ran out of that cubicle at 4:40 so i could change and grab everything (and leave some things behind cuz my bag was heavy enough as it was) and run to the subway station to meet amywe subway-ed down to union feeling like idiots because we were carrying those teeny-bopper posters.    We started following the signs and directions around to the skywalk, then through the skywalk to find the north metro convention centre (the south was where the uni fair was last year) and finally we were almost there and we heard screaming...outside the building.. and were like..shoooot, they've begun lining up already! so we raced out and found that there were a bunch of people there already, but we weren't too far from the entrance (even though we couldn't see it). We joined the screaming hordes of fans and joined in enthusiastically! thanks to amy's wonderful costume of a mask and cape with her 'kalan is my hero' sign, we got rush seats and entered canadian idol's john bassett theatre!! my very first concert- CI!!! great fun!    we sat beside some woman from ottawa who waved around our pom poms (made courtesy of jadie! thank you!) and finally got settled enough to wave our signs and take pictures of the pre-show things (which werne't much, but we were introduced to the judges as they came out, and saw ben mulroney's godson and john dore's finacee) and FINALLY the show began (signal to applaud)!!    Kalan sang Still..what can i say? he's a amazing, and i heartily agree with Sass' comment: "Kalan, you've just turned from goodboy to dreamboy" hahaha! next up was Theresa who sang Hello, which was a GREAT performance! she sounds SO much better live than on tv- sounds much more powerful. After her was Shane singing Angel.. what a surprise! i never liked him much before, but after the first few wobbly notes, it was really good! great song selection for him! after came Kaleb singing Truly who i thought pulled up a bit short on his performance this time- i've just gotten used to his style, and he didn't change it around as much as he usually did.. and i really wish he'd stop doing that little shoulder-gangster-rapping thingy! STOP IT!!!! (well..guess i won't be bugged by that anymore, which makes me a little sad...he really was a great singer and performer! my fav performance of his was his sing-out of Truly which i thought was 'truly' excellent! haha oh no stop me, i'm sounding like sass. Anyhoo, after Kaleb came the idol i've been waiting for- Jacob!! he sang Breakhouse which was a good performance, but definitely not his best! it still wasn't that bad, but my all-time favourite of his performances was 'everything' by lifehouse during the rock 'n roll week, closely follwed by david bowie's 'space oddity'. during his interview with ben, the camera flashed to me and amy (i was screaming like a maniac..i think i was yelling 'we love you jacob!!...i said -something 'jacob' anyway...and waving around my poster (JACOB ROX MY SOX) and amy was clapping)! woo hoo, on national tv! after jacob came Elena who sang 'Fancy Dancer' and i thought her performance was SOOOO GREAT! i was unbelieving when i saw that she was in the bottom two the next day. jason came last, and i was so happy to see that he was singing a slow song (Easy)- a much better change from his usually upbeat songs which were more shouting than singing.    Then came autograph time! I GOT EVERYBODY'S AUTOGRAPH OR PICTURE WITH THEM! let's see..first was Jacob- he signed my poster! haha! i passed it up to him and he played with the finger a bit and gave me this weird look and he signed it and when he passed it back to me, he was like 'Guess what?' me: 'what?' him: 'I dress myself!' me: 'uhhh.... cool!' haha! damn...i should have said 'good for you! you look awesome!' ... he looks even better in person than on tv, and that is SO RARELY true these days! i also saw him with his girlfriend right at the beginning of the autograph signing. him: 'hey! it's my girlfriend! how'd they let you up here so fast? *leans down and kisses her* i'll talk to you later' haha! it was a very cute and tasteful exchange- not like those ppl in the cafe at lunch...i mean, plz, people eating here! then i got kaleb's autograph, followed by jason's (on my shirt- which i had painted and thus ruined, but is no longer ruined and has been transformed to awesome because of the autographs :) ) and met amy who was still waiting for kalan to sign her cape. meanwhile I got a picture with theresa and shane, and finally with kalan (after they had turned off most of the theatre lights and told everyone to go home...besides the final avid fangirl and the idols' friends and family, we were one of the last to leave. We then subway-ed home, laughing and shrieking about what a great time we had...and we did! WOO FOR CANADIAN IDOL!!
