We wenta' KIMAGE at Lot 1 and the haircut costs about.. $25.20. Mucho cheaper than Jean Yip and Jantzen. Actually my Mom doesn't allow me to spend so much on a haircut, cos I usually cut for $12. *Teehee. On the other hand... I received about $26 from Lucas, Jason and Jeremy cos we intro-ed each other for some math tuition thingy so we split the money up. Hohoho.. I trimmed and layered my hair and fringe. Nana looks the most different among the 3 of us. Tomorrow's Sports Day and I'm really excited! *Woot!* :P Oh ya.. the math test this afternoon was a disaster! My last question.. Hoho, I forgot to arc cosine, neither did Gabriel. Anyways.. gonna have dinner now. Toodles kids! :P
