She been practicing so hard and it has always being her dream to be field commander since she started band. I am so proud of her because she had made one of her dreams come true. Nitro Band will be better next year b/c of her. I have to admit that our band is one of the best in West Virginia and we also have one of the best drumlines east of the Mississippi River.  Well, that all for now. Talk to ya later.  p.s.     come visit my lj if you can.
