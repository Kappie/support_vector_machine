This is such a book. Written from the point of view of a 15 year old autic boy you see the world as he sees it. I couldn't put it down...thankfully it is only about 200 pages and so I was able to finish with in a few hours.   The honesty is refeshing, and funny at times. And it makes you look at an all to common event through the eyes of an idividual who can't understand all the complexities of that event and yet he still manages to succeed in his own goals even though his world crumbles around him. I would recomend that everyone should read this book. It is a fast and fairly light read but one that really makes you think. Besides the style of writing alone is worth it.
