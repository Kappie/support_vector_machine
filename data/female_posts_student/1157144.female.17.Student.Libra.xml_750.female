So this will suffice until I go out tonight. At first, I wasn’t sorry…I was under the impression that I hadn’t even hit you, just popped 4 balloons in your face. I talked with several people the next day, and the day after that, and they weren’t sure either, so I did nothing. However, I had read your live journal because I needed to know what was going on, and in doing so found out what had really happened that day. I just want to say that I never intended to hit you, and that I was wrong in doing so. As Carlie has repeatedly told me, I could/should have just walked away, but I was too caught up in your antagonizing to do the right thing…no, I am not blaming my actions on you, either, blame falls on me. And I am sorry for what I did. As for my “pompous assness,” to quote Carlie, I will try and avoid that. I never actually mean to be that way, it just happens to be the way things come out. So, I’ll work on improving that in the future, although it may take a while, since I oftentimes don’t realize that what I say comes out as condescending. Now that you know how I feel about the issue, and that I didn’t know what had really happened, please take my explanation into consideration and understand my reasoning of the situation. Feel free to talk if you wish to yell at me or want more of an explanation.
