Little did I know that my parents were telling Alice how completely irresponsible I was, and how she needed to take care of me. Team reckless. Team Chastity. Reckless Chastity. Rock on.      urlLink    Well, Here we all are in It- oh wait, no. This is an Embassy Suites outside of Dulles Airport. This is where we all spent the night, cause the French and this woman named Rachel (We still have to kill her) messed up our "E-Tickets" or some crap. Poor Ms. Hefty. See that fake rose in front? It's no longer there. We stole it for Ms. Hefty. We love her so much. This is where we sat for a good while. Doing nothing. Dont worry, we moved to the lobby to the right and did a hell of a lot more waiting around. For nothing. For a long time. Woo. The saga begins: Operation SOMEHOW GET TO ITALY has commenced.    urlLink    This is the beautiful Embassy Suites Room where these lovely ladies and I had the pleasure of staying.  We got to eat dinner for like three whole hours that night!  And the lady thpoke a Thpanith.  (spokeaspanish).  Molly and I had a good night of Bridget Jones in the next room's King sized bed, and all four of us had a slumber party where we exchanged major secrets like any good sleepover.  It was quite fun, actually, for not being in Italy.  Or so we thought, until we actually got to Italy and realised that, wait, it was much cooler.    urlLink    Alice and I on the bus going BACK to the airport.  The sad part is that we're happy cause we THINK we have a flight.  Ah, so misled! God damn that Rachel.  No, we wasted our energy being happy thinking we were going to Canada.  Imagine!  Being happy to go to Canada!   Also note the matching polos and pearls.  Nice touch, no? It is our Puertorican Style showing through. Okay, so here's Cita and I looking wonderfully fakely happy and kind of not well rested.  I look really gross in this picture, why am I posting it?  Oh well.    urlLink    This lady was extreemely awesome.  Conor called her a "Mother Hen" cause she led us little chicks across this CRAZY WORLD we call.... Heathrow?  Yeah.  That one in London.  Right-o.  Anyway, the weird thing about Airports in London, or at least this one is that NOBODY TALKS! It's amazing, a public place that sounds like a library! It's increadible, and definately scary, cause we, the loud Americans that we are, made lots of noise.  Oh by the way, these are the lucky eight who made it onto a flight. Nine were stillstuck in Dulles.  Thus the happy smiles we all have.  Still Rockin the Polos, a day later. mmmm.  Rock on, flight attendant lady, we love you.    urlLink    This is us after a few hours in the airport.  Let's just say that we all smelled, well, quite aweful after a long time of traveling.  Planes smell bad.  Molly re-deoderizes, and saves us all from her stench.  Note Brett's expression.  Is he offended by Molly's smell? Nah, he's just tired.  No drama here, sorry guys.    urlLink    NOT AMUSED!  But we made it!  Molly and I are on a train from Rome to Naples, where we would meet Mr. Slipek.  No wait, Mr. Slipek was on the train.  Yeah, where we would meet Mr. Ross and the rest of the kids.  Those lucky bastards who made it.  Anyway,  this is us completely looking and feeling completely like shit.  again, why do I post this?  I know not.  But note the snazzy new $10 watch my mom got me from Target.  It broke, the jerk.  But oh well.  I think this is the last Polo picture, I am afraid, because we smell so bad that these clothes went directly into a bag I labeled "Condemned!" and were not brought out of it again until I got home.  Man did they stink.  Alright, enough about the stinking.    urlLink    My first ever view of..... that's right...... ITALY!!!! so we made it.  Note the, uh, glare from the flash on the left.  and the uh, mountains.... i think.... and uh..... anyway, this train ride was so amazing, it was one of the best parts of the trip because I got to take in Italy's beautiful scenery all at once, and while everybody on the train was sleeping I just kept looking out the window in awe, it was so cool.  the scenery was this dramatic, there were aqueducts in front of mountains and cliffs and the mountains went up into these rolling puffy clouds and you couldn't see the tops.  And the coolest thing about it was the yellow tint to everything, it seemed like another planet.  It was so increadibly beautiful, I was so so thankful to finally be there. Despite my expression in the last picture of utter fatigue.    urlLink    We reuinite with the oh so fragrant and showered Sara Warren, and then we showered, and this is the view from our room.  I'm talkin Ruins, Ocean, and yes, even powerlines.  We had our own balcony.  Did I meantion we were showered?  That is why we are so damn happy.  Besides the fact that we finally made it to the most beautiful place ever.  This is "The Villa"  outside of Naples, and Mr. Ross's favorite place we stay.  I like it Because of the Eggs in the morning, which is what I can eat.  Actually I like it for the general food.  Its really good.  Mmmm, showered.  Clean clothes.  You have no idea just how good they felt.   urlLink    The roomies.  And Sam Blankenship.  Who is quite Awesome.  This is just our room again.  It was a really nice room, too, if i do say so myself.  Note the view, my bed is the one in front, and um, yeah thats about it. The villa rocks.    If you went on the trip, or wish you did, make some comments for me so I'll post more.  Put your own captions to the pictures if you want to.  Also, if you went on the trip and have some photos, I'd love to put them up here, you can IM me at volleyballgal459, thanks.
