Hee hee~ Coolness. I'm obsessed with the American Pie song.   I'm pretty friendly with Brian, Martin L, and Martin Y. I hope Nima doesn't mind. They're like... family. My brothers. They diss me and I diss them back. I punch them but they don't punch me back. We have our chinese jokes... they make me laugh. Haha... it's like being "one of the guys" with them. Their stupid comments are mad funny and yeah. They don't treat me like a girl and like I'm all delicate. We were throwing stuff down Brian's shirt and Martin mentioned throwing it down my shirt (only jokingly) and I'm like: "Yeah okay! I dare you! You'll get beat up if you do!" but I know he didn't mean it. It was only meant to be a joke. Not to be taken seriously. We played rock paper scissors and whoever lost had to take of a piece of clothing and they dared me to play and I said okay since I had a jacket, a tank top, and another spaghetti strap under that. So we played and I only took off my jacket. Martin Y and Brian had to take off their shoes. Martin Y had to take off his glasses. Haha... they're hilarious. Weirdos... brothers :)  It's like Nima and Alice, kind of. They're best friends... Martin Y, Martin L, and Brian aren't my best friends but they're good buds of mine. Brothers! ^^ Haha...!  Nima if you don't like me hanging out with them then it's okay too. I don't mind not hanging out with them. There are always my girl friends. :) Let me know if you're uncomfortable with it okay?  Well that's it for tonight. Blog tomorrow.
