We headed to Starkville and went to JC Penney to meet up with her aunt and cousin who is 10 and talkative. Anyways we went their, she bought a lot of stuff, and I got 1 black shirt that says Pixie with Tinkerbell on the front and back. REALLY CUTE. Then we headed to Columbus and went into Burlington Shoe store, and looked for Ashley some shoes. I already bought mine. She didn't find anything and then we went to the mall. Went into Shoe Dept. she found some cute blue and yellow sketchers. I liked the pink and black though. ^_^ Then after that we went into Sears. I bought another shirt that says DOTS like the candy. Then we went to Claire's I bought me a Happy Bunny Pillow and a ring that has dice in it. SO CUTE. Ashley bought me a pair of earrings for my bday. (April 30) Then we went into 4ever Young which didn't have much. Then after that we went to Pizza Hut, and ate. Yum. Then we went to McRae's, which I think I LOVE!!! They had the most cutest shirts and pants. It was alot like JC Penney 'cept with more variety and better sales. I bought a shirt on the sales rack for 1.99 ROCKIN!!! Then I bought this blue and baby blue cap. Matches my chuck's. Big Pimpin. Anyways I had lots of fun. We were going to go bowling but her little cousin aggravated the heck out of his momma so we couldn't go. Pooey. Oh well.  >>today tregory came over. woohoo. we played basketball. i won. cause i played by my rules (lots of fouling). hehehe, anyways i've seen the biggest trend this year is Pink and Black. and it doesn't have to be PUNK its on EVERYTHING!!! i swear...some pink and black is okay but i see it everywhere. ugh. and also "vintage" shirts that have stuff on 'em. Like DOTS candy or CHARMS suckers. yameen? they are cute but its such a trend. BLAH...anyways tomorrow is band camp. woohoo lucky me.
