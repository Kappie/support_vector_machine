I was going to bring up something else, but it jsut hit me how busy this coming week is going to be and how unpleasant Monday is going to be in particular. I still have no front page. I have two stories to finish by tomorrow and it's already 5:35. I'm probably going to stay after until I absolutely have to go to the piano lesson, and even then it won't be reason to rest easy: I'm completely expecting an icky panel evaluation back tomorrow, and I have no motivation to practice. NO MOTIVATION AT ALL  reading the signs, Reading the Signs, READING THE SIGNS. and it doesn't look good. at all.  Much madness is divinest sense.  I hate driving lessons? maybe.
