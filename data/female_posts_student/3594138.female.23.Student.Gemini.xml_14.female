I thought it was rather revolutionary for a film made in 1967, but I'm not sure if that's a correct assessment since I am quite naive as to the social and political climate of the era. First, the cinematography alone was pretty damn good. It was a well-made movie, plain and simple. Second, I just loved the soundtrack (which is basically a Simon and Garfunkel album). But it just fit the movie soooo well. More than just the words describing what's going on in the movie, the music seemed to embody its spirit. Of course, the acting was superb as well. But in terms of its characters... I just don't understand what Ben's appeal is. He has no identity, no values he can call his own, not that I hold it against him - but I don't understand why Elaine fell in love with him so fast and was willing to forgive him so quickly for having an affair with her mother. But his persistence and determination is admirable.  Which brings me to Mrs. Robinson, who is the most complex and interesting character in the movie. She's in a loveless marriage, and we see a glimpse of her youthful hopes and dreams and how they've come to a bitter end. She's a strong woman, who seeks out her happiness. In fact, she's so complex, I am still not quite sure why she got so flared up when Ben started talking about Elaine. Is it because, as she said, she doesn't think Ben is good enough for Elaine? Is it because of jealousy and competition? Does she even love Elaine? Does she want to protect her daughter? It's quite perplexing.  Anyway, I found the movie fascinating and pretty funny too. I heard they're doing a remake with Jennifer Aniston - interesting...
