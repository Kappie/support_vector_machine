But I do know I didn't score the lowest.  I figure I'm right in the middle since he said our grades were all over the distribution scale and he wasn't too pleased.  He's going to let us use notes now.  It's always nice to know I'm failing my doctoral level class after just one class.   We did take a quiz last night and I think I did pretty good on that one.  Let's hope anyway.  I think I figured out how to read such mass quantities.  I asked my dad how he does it.  How he reads stuff he has no baseline knowledge for.  He said he looks up the stuff he doesn't know, does research on it, and then reads.  This is entirely too much work.  Although maybe I need to put more effort into my studies.  It's difficult though since all my friends are out of school and I want to do things with them.  I've noticed that my classmates seem to be doing a lot more than I.  I'm what you call an achiever.  I do all that I have to and not more.  They are what you call over achievers.  Maybe I need to be one.  I should be one.  I was so scared I wouldn't get accepted into my program and now that I'm in it, I'm not putting in much effort.  I do well in class, but I've never had to put much effort in it.  I figure I should probably put more time and effort into this educational process.  Besides who would want to see a psychologist that only half-ass got what they should've out of their education?
