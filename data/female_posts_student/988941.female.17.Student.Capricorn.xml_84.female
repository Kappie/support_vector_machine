The whole us lot getting banned from the tech block has really peed me off, I mean, we don't exactly trash the place!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Where are we suposed to go now though huh? Our old corner? Thats a bit cold and wet. Ew. Fair enough if it were sunny but helooooooo this is england! We don't do sun! Much. Then bloody Chris in english flicking that candy off those candy necklasses thing. He was trying to hit Lee but got me instead an dit bloody well stung like mad. If I had looked up just at that moment it would've got me in the eye. Then when I anwsered Sir's questions and it took like ten minutes just for people to write it down. Geez. Now I am cream-crackered and wondering where our Jo has gone. Jo? Where you ma Freddie friend? And Jackie, I got ma Here On Earth DVD! Yay.
