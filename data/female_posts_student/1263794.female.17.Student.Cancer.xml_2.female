My sister is getting MARRIED next weekend, not to mention she's pregnant, plus this crap with school, and then my family that have been acting nuts. You know my life really is like a sitcom. I wonder if there's hidden cameras all over my house like in the Truman Show. You know that movie really freaked me out because it COULD be true and the whole movie could just be a ploy to make you think something like that could never happen. That movie really did get me thinking up all these "what-if" situations. If you haven't seen it you should definitely rent it. You know what else is a good movie, The Lion King. That movie rocks. I'm listening to Hakuna Matata right now. It's a great song. It is a sad movie though. I could never watch the part where Mufassa dies, I always had to fast forward through it. I always cry in Disney movies. The Fox and the Hound has got to be the all time worst tear jerkers. Man why the hell do they make Disney movies so sad? Their suposed to be for kids. I'm surprised our whole generation isn't depressed. They should start blaming depression cases on Disney. People could sue.  Well my mom just got home with the chinese food so it's time for me to go.
