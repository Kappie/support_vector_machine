So that meant that I had to miss rehearsal for  Wings , our competition play.  I'm kind of glad I wasn't there though. G, our theatre teacher/director, kicked about a third of the people out of the play because they were goofing off and missing cues... G was really, really, super-ultra pissed and he said that he had "never been more disappointed in a group of students before".   The people that he kicked out were most of the best actors and actresses at our school and he recast their parts to sucky sophomores with little or no acting experience, making them far less than qualified to be in the competition play.... Needless to say, anyone who gave a damn about theatre at Jefferson was pissed at G.. All day people were talking to him about, whether calmly or in anger.. In 7th period (Theatre3), a class which many people in  Wings  have, G pulled us all to the back of the auditorium and had a good, long talk to us about what happened yesterday and how he felt and what options he had... After quite a bit of lecturing, G said he would go back to the original cast, and then began asking the people that he kicked out if they were willing to come back. Everyone said they would come back, except Bryan who changed his mind after Tab, who was also kicked out of the play, talked. She told everyone to swallow their pride and come back. She was crying and what she said was really good... Way to go Tab...  .....G also said that it was "scary" how much talent was in our school. Wheee... We gots talent!    ...There was more to my bad day than that, but that was what got it going in such a bad direction... Oh, and I got a new keyboard and mouse! Yay! ... I love 'em!  On Monday and Tuesday, I'm going to be in Charleston to be a page at the State Legislature. I'm so excited!    ..I'm also getting out of rehearsal those two days. G didn't seem too care much, as long as I was sure the other sound tech (who isn't too wise in the ways of the sound board) was able to run sound those days... She says that she can... I think I'm going to have her run sound tomorrow to make sure she actually can do it.  I wore flip-flops again today.  ...It's official, I love flip-flops.   Oh, and even as much as I hate people, I do adore some of them. People can be so sweet. It's crazy the compliments I've been getting from everyone lately...   I think I had more to say, but oh well... I forget, I guess....  Oh!... For my research paper, I think I am going to on the legalization of drugs. It'll be fun.
