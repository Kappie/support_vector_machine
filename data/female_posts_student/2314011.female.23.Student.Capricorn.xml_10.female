Yes, that is how I was introduced to one of my good friends, Ms. Carrie "Shut the Fuck Up" Johnson. As you can tell by her name, that Pollyana attitude went to the way-side eventually, but we still like to bring it up every once in a while.   So now that she's been introduced, you'll probably be hearing more about her in the entries to follow.  Here's the cliff notes on her story thus far:   Fate brought us together at the University of Idaho Queer Student Association and allowed us to continue our blossoming friendship at the University's Library, where, over the following years, great trials and tribulations came to pass.  But, we persevered and have lived to tell the tale.   This summer, Ms. Johnson (aka Anastasia Beaverhausen), up and decided that she was tired of this side of the continent and needed to make her way across the country to live in Boston, Mass.   And, by god, she pulled it off!  YAY!  GO CARRIE! Today she begins a new job in that fair city as a crusading social worker, saving down and out citizens from the evils of the world around them by day, saving her evenings for the Jack  Karen hour.  (That's code for Will  Grace:  it's not about Jack or Karen, and it's not an hour, but it's the Jack  Karen hour.)  So, there you have it.    Congratulations on the new job, sweetie pie.  I know you'll do great things.  And if anyone gives you any guff, just have them call your attorney who also dispenses medical advice.
