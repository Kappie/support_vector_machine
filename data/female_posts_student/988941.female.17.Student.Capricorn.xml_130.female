Its just rather annoying when people press enter as in enter for a new paragraph every time they start a new sentance!!  I am in such a good mood today. I'm not sure why. Lots of reasons I guess such as the fact that I am alive, my hair is curly today, its a nice morning, I'm going out with friends later, one week left until half term, my friends in other countries are so lovely, the pictures website has gone well and its all good as the americans would say. Talking of websites, Dave T has given me co-running the Year 11 Party Pics site, its just been re-done so go and check it out, tell me what you think. There are a few bugs we are sorting out  though.  urlLink Year 11 Party PIctures!!!
