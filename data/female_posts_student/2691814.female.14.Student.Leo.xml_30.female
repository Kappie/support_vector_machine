She passed out three times from what she told me. She has this thing where if she doesn't eat she gets moody and passes out. But anyway, tomarrow is Florida Writes. We are given a prompt and we have to write about it. My english class has been studying writing skills for 2 weeks for it. So far the schools highest marks were 3.9 everyone wants a 4. Hopefully our team will win for the attendence thing for tomarrow. Supposedly its a big accomplishment for teams.    Well anyway...a person from DPHS VPA dance magnet program called me tonight. She sounded about 16 or 17. She called to answere any questions that I had, which i did, and I guess i'll see her at the audition. She's just auditioning for placement cuz she's already in the program.      Okay well anyway, I'm watching 7th H. and will be watching EVERWOOD yay lol..so i'll be aposting tomarrow.
