The description says... “Warmhearted, conscientious, and cooperative.  Want harmony in their environment, work with determination to establish it.  Like to work with others to complete tasks accurately and on time.  Loyal, follow through even in small matters.  Notice what others need in their day-by-day lives and try to provide it.  Want to be appreciated for who they are and for what they contribute.”  Dad’s going to bring home my actual results tomorrow to see what I’d be good at, so that should be fun, and hopefully helpful.  Hope everyone is having a good week and preparing for those exams ; )  I gotta go number my measures... until next time!  Cool song alert!  Barenaked Ladies – “Falling for the First Time” ....Anyone perfect must be lying Anything easy has its cost Anyone plain can be lovely Anyone loved can be lost What if I lost my direction What if I lost sense of time What if I nursed this infection Maybe the worst is behind It feels just like I’m falling for the first time...
