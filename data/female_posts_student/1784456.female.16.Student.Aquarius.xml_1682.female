Ahhhh why do I not get any spam about clearing wax or something useful like that? *and totally gross* Gyaaahhh but how will I compose!!! *does a sakano-san style tornado and hits the wall* Ahh, all better. Umm... don't ask I drank last night and I haven't had much sleep! Then I woke up deaf and croaky... and not with £1m at the foot of my bed! *dam wishes don't work!* (...going byeeee...)
