It would be an understatement to say that I enjoyed myself in Bintan..  The sea is so crystal clear, you can practically see every fish or seashell in the water... This is the first time I have snorkelled, and I fell in love with it! Although I nearly drowned myself by swimming too far offshore... Eeks! I wasn't too familiar with the snorkelling equipment, water got into my snokell set, and I couldn't get it out.. Lucky I managed to swim back onshore!!!  But hey, that is not gonna stop me from snorkelling.. What's drinking a little sea water?? ITs totally worth it... I'll never forget swimming with the fishes around me.. Colourful tropical fishes... Reminds me of Nemo...  I feel like I'm one with nature.... Although I did see 2 jellyfishies! Eeks!! Avoided them as fast as I could... =)  There was once when my brother and I were sitting close to shore and there came a school of little fishes hovering around us! hehez.. They nibbled on my toes... hehez.. ticklish...  The bintan beach was practically empty while we were there... We had the whole beach to ourselves... And the view was spectacular... I'm sure gonna miss it so much...  And the stars! I have never really seen stars before my trip to bintan.. The nightsky was filled with stars.. big ones, tiny ones, all sparking bright..  The pub which is in the middle of the pool was so cool.. You could read sitting on the seats with your feet touching the water... The cocktail tasted wonderful.. I ordered a Bananarama... Yummy..  My brother took us for a ride on the banana boat.. I loved the speed of riding on the sea!  The guy on the speedboat was being naughty by constantly U'Turning the boat and letting us fall.. I fell three times!! Lucky I had my lifejacket on as I was in the middle of the sea.. But my butt hurt so much from each fall... yikes.. =)  The ride was so fast that J cried and had to be carried off.. I felt sorry for her, but she seemed pretty regretful that she missed it... I was consoling her and told her we can do other stuff.. It was sad that she couldn't join me in snorkelling as she can't swim.. But she soon cheered up anyway suntanning and picking up seashells!  The seashells were bigger than beaches in Singapore.. There is a type of sea coral called 'sea coins' They are so beautiful, with flowers inscribed by mother nature on the surface of each sea coin.. Picked a couple home for my friends.. Its hard to find perfect ones as they were pretty fragile and breaks easilly.. I got some near perfect ones nonetheless... Think I'm quite lucky. hehe..  Waking up in the morning with the coconut trees and the sea greeting you makes me wanna live there forever..  The islanders were pretty friendly too.. Even the gardeners greet you good morning..  My brother asked me if it was my first holiday trip.. I told him its my first trip to a beach.. He said not to worry, there will be plenty more in the future.. I certainly hope so! =)  I told him that I enjoyed myself so much.. Thanked him non stop... hehez..  Plenty more adventure awaits... I can't wait! Life is too short!
