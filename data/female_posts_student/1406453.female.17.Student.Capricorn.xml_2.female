The whole 365 love letters story was very endearing- what it must be like!  It seems like such an incredible era to live in. Also went to the fair today.  Not much to say, spent a lot of money, did many things.  Not so impressive, but good excercise between the walk to the car and the people I had to shove my way thru.  Oy. Looking forward to a quiet tomorrow.  P.S. 5 year anniversary of my Bat Mitzvah today!
