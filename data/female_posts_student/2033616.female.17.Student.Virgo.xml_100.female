Oh well... if i'm lucky i will feel just as crappy tomorrow and MISS CONTEST yay!!! i HATE district contests.  I hate them i hate them i hate them.    Okay, now that that's done, i must say this.  I MISS MY POSSE!!!!  I need a Carrie-movie night.  I need a sleep-over at Kayli's.  I need a trip to Garretson w/ Lindsey and Jamie, a late night in Aris's basement, a trip to century theaters with Sam.  I need a day running all over Sioux Falls with Lindsey, Jamie, Aris, Sam, and Chad.  Don't get me wrong, people from school, I love you... but... the triplets... the posse... the fab 4... the Jackson 4 1/2... I need them!!!  Why oh why oh why can't i have it all.  It's impossible to mix so many people together, (Geoff, you can vouch for me on that!)  but why can't i have everything?  I've found you just can't replace one person with another, each person is so unique, so different.  Remember, i love you all, but man oh man do i ever miss being frizzie Lizzie, activities coordinator for the posse.
