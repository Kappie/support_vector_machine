MCAS was dumb, but that's ok, it's done for now.  I talked to the other cool kid on the phone and she sang me half of happy birthday, so phone hug to you!  I am so so excited for tomorrow.  My mom even said she would get up early and make me French toast for breaky fast since her little baby is all grown up.    Boys are dumb and just need to go away.  Please.  Thanks.
