They had DDR... lol I suck so bad at that...  and yummy food (Char: "I LOVE food when it's in pockets!") and fu√üball which I'm pretty good at... mostly we just danced though, cause Charlotte bought the new MJ cd "Number Ones" and come on, if you can't dance to MJ then you just can't dance. So what with people playing DDR upstairs and music blasting and people dancing downstairs, the whole house was shaking.. haha so yeah, fun times all around. Not as many people went to the play on Saturday... Friday we pretty much sold out, but on Saturday we weren't even close. But that means that me and Josh could close up the booth early, so we hit Starbucks.... then Mexico....
