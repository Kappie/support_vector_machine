(brace yourselves)  you know how there are words that can't be translated from one language to another?  does that drive you crazy, or is it just me?  but then i thought to myself, is that really that strange?  cause i always found it hard to beleive, that a feeling or a point of view or a thought couldn't be communicated, or translated, yet someone else could learn it or feel it.  or something. do you see where i'm going with this.  no? me either.  but the somewhat point of it is......... when i thought about it, it kind of makes sense. because most of my days, i can't even communicate or express basic human emotion.   wait. no.  wait.  my throat hurts.
