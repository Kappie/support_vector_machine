Whenever I was told this translation I was told that since the shape of 'binds' is likeladies fingers so that's why it is given this name. I used to be fascinated by this fact always, and used to think that it has been named rightly.    Then I came to UK. Here nobody knew about 'ladies fingers'. I was disappointed to see that. 'How can these people not know the name of the vegetable in their own language?', I would say to myself. Then I discovered the word 'ocra' and my life was saved.    Then I wondered that why in the world we, in Pakistan, still call it 'ladies fingers'. But then we don't call it that. We call it 'Bhindi'. ;)
