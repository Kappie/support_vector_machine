I just wanted to tell everyone that i'm so grateful for having the best friends in the world. They really do care about me a lot and I am so very lucky to have them. Thanks guys, you really do mean a lot to me. Also, my family is wonderful as well. God has blessed me with the people he's put in my life. I hope that i'm as good of a friend to you guys as ya'll are to me.  Hrmm... camp is coming up soon and that should be fun, lets hope.   Ughh... after pine cove camp, it's leadership camp, and then it's full band camp, and then it's welcome back concert, and then it's my senior year of highschool. It's guna start getting busy!   I have a lot of mosquito bites on me from being outside these past couple of days. But that's ok, fireworks are fun to watch, but bad Richardson community band is not so fun to listen to.   well i think that's all i have to say for right now  bye guys  -Lisa  song: "What Ever Happened?" - The Strokes
