I also drove to the N.W. today and to south centre, wendys, petland, dollar store, and a whole bunch of places.  Later on I am going to drive back to the N.W. to pick up my Dad.  Tomorrow, we are practicing my parking and I am going to book my road test.  That's right, I feel it's time.  It's time to take my Drivers Test.  I am going to book it for a time over spring break near the end, so the days off I can keep practicing and then do it!  I am so excited!
