A book meant to enrage the reader into action, into doing something.  A book where the author clearly wants the reader to experience the disbelief, the shock of the experience.  An experience one can only assume the author went through.  It was about a girl who is a creative writing major who pursues, seduces, and sleeps with her prof.  And then switches it around to make it appear that she was the wronged one.  That he traded sex with her for an introduction to his publisher.  I'm still undecided on whether or not I liked it.  I rewrote the above paragraph in three different places.  My concern was that you wouldn't be interested in reading about some book I read.  It all seems so silly compared to what you're doing.  And here I am agonizing over what you will and won't want to read when you get back.  If you do come back and if you do decide to read this.  So the e-mail you sent me, this is the one time I will address it on here.  But you probably need some of the back story on how I was handling your absence before any of this will make sense. I was doing okay. yes, i missed you and yes, I thought about you often. but I had gotten to the point where I was not freaking out when there was no word for a month.  the time interval between our contact was growing and I was growing accustomed to it.  the bad thing about it was that when I did get upset, (which I only did once during April/May, and I am proud that I was able to go two months) that was when I wrote to you or your mom.  I feel like your mom totally thought that I was falling apart. which I wasn't.  And I don't know how to be more clear on that, I was doing good.  I knew that things weren't going to be the same, but I still had hope.  So then I get this e-mail from you that is totally removed.  You rushed over the topic, rather harshly, as if it were on the same level as the pointless chit chat that preceded it in the e-mail. That was what hurt the most.  Not the idea of us being over, but the way you said it.  In truth I had been distancing myself from you since you left.  Jamey didn't even know your name, neither does wayne. they know you as my boy in Africa.  I talk about you all the time, but I always say "my boy in Africa."  And recently when talking to guys that I would have normally dated, when asked about you and i, I was honest and upfront. I told them I didn't know what was going to happen, that at one point I was convinced I would marry you.  And in talking about you to new people I realized a lot of things...  that a huge part of why I loved you was because you never made me guess. I never questioned anything, our relationship or your love for me.  there was no grace period when I would wonder when you were going to call because we were never not together after that Tuesday.  I could tell just by looking at you that you loved me.  And I had never experienced that before.  And I guess that is why it is so hard for me to believe you are able to completely drop that. I know you loved me.  If you didn't I fell like my world would come crashing down.  If I imagined that how will i ever know when real love comes along?  okay so this has turned into a long rambling, whining letter. enough. But I want you to know one thing, I cried more when you left in Jan. then when you sent that e-mail. That should show you just how much I had been distancing myself from you.  I started this "journal" as a way to communicate to you.  This will be the only post like this. hopefully. they will be more thought out and cohesive in the future.
