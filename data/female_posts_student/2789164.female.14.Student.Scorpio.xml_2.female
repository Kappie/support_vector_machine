To be quite frank i have compleatly forgotten to keep my blog updated. So im gonna do a big post to keep everyone updated and awake!   So no valantines... im gonna die soon - no boys at all. maybe i am gay?! ummmmm no! - hope not anyway! thats my love life done - although there is a really cute guy on the bus. I bet he will never ask me out!  school is sooooo boring as well. Why the hell did i take latin? we have a latin trip soon and i hate the latin teacher. :( - oh woe is i! lol at least we miss maths! we have a french trip to! (why the hell did i do french?) but we miss biology which is fine! we have a big music concert soon as well. I have loads of rehursals so im gonna be missing school. The only thing that is bad is that i am missing physics. thats the only thing that i enjoy at school. Well i like sports, music, chem and physics and thats it.   Life is crap - i am just feeling really depressed at the moment. I am just depressed. Its cos i have no contact with any of my friends :( - awww i miss them all.  awww im gonna cry now...
