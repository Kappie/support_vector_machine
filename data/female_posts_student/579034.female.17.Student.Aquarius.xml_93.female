The bottoms have to stay on for a little while though. It was so funny, when I asked him if he could take them off he goes, "I'll make you a deal. We'll take the tops off next time but the bottoms have to stay on for another two months." I was like "OKAY!" and when it was all written down and stuff he goes "Congradulations, you made it half way." and then since I was like the last person to get worked on that day everyone in the office heard and like a chorus of "Congradulations, Lauren!" rang out lol. I felt like I really achieved something rahter then just have these metal things on my teeth for two years and three months. It will be a relief to have them off. And just in time for when Mick comes again in February and for my 17th birthday. Kick ass to the extreme man. Okay South Park is on, gotta go! x0x
