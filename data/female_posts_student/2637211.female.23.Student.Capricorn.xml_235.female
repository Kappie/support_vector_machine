I need to renew some of those learning efforts. I meant to go to the library today, but somehow the momentum wasn't there for me today. I'm not even really sure what to make for dinner tonight. I made cookies this morning and then spent a long time on the phone with both Holly and then with Alex. We decided that she needs a baby shower soon, and I'd always planned on hosting it, so I am. Now we just have to see who will come and who cares.  So I've been living the drunken housewife life, except I haven't been as drunk as I ought to be, and I'm not legally married to my "partner" or fiance or whatever I should call the Jerm. But it's like we're married. We've been contemplating eloping, but that would put to waste all of this lame wedding research I've been doing, and I think that a lot of people would get all butt-hurt about it. It's weird how much emotion people put into other people's wedding. I was hanging out with Alexa and Dave, and a friend of their's was going to have a tiny wedding, family only, and they were all talking about how lame and selfish it was. It makes me even more anxious about the idea of a wedding. It's funny that marriage itself seems perfectly natural and I think I'll enjoy it, but the wedding sounds very weird.
