"Well, fine, go take a nap.....THEN GO FIRE THE MISSILES!"   urlLink http://members.cox.net/impunity/endofworld.swf    That is the funniest thing ever. Seriously. I've died laughing so many times.  In other news, my cat thinks she has gone wiiiiiiiild.  I put up our christmas tree a couple a days ago, nearly killed me. Now, she hides underneath the tree and hunts imaginary birds. If you are still long enough, you can see the tree shake a little, as she goes insane. Mind you, if you get to close to the tree, she'll shoot out from underneath it like a grey furry rocket.  I don't know what she'll do when we put the decorations on the tree. I don't really want too, it's way to funny watching her "hunt" things that aren't even there.   Today was my first day at school. I felt like dying during my first block, I was so tired, and dizzy feeling. But as the day wore on I felt better. Most of second block was spent standing building a computer, so I had to get used to it. By socials I was my normal bouncy-ish self. Of course, I sound sick, I'm coughing like MAD, and I can't squeak (really eerie) but hey! I'm alive :)  Laura's drawing a house. It's so pretty :)
