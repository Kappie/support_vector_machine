So I would probably get sacked within....2 weeks? Well I will def get a job towards the end of the summer/begining of sixth form because that is when all the Uni folk will quit their jobs as they head off to uni and their holidays with their friends. Hmm, this shall be interesting because what I am actually do right now is just typing so I can see if people actually read the posts on here. So I am going to ask and say random things, I will only know if you have read it by you mentioning it so lets have a lookie and see where this experiment goes. Speaking of experiments does anyone miss science experiments? I know in our set 1 class they could sometimes be hard but I thought our was of actually doing them was funny. Geting in one large group of 7 rather than the 3/4 we were supposed to be in...LOL. Then of course everyone has their own jobs. ie: I would take results, Max would time, Andy would refill the acid of whatever, Jackie always did the hands on part. It worked and made it fun. Hmm...can pigs fly? That's a scientific question. For my birthday this year I want to do something crazy...yes...I want to go horse riding! Woo! I have never been before and I think it would be a laugh. Hmm..I wonder if they have any jobs going at the nearby stables. That would be great. Working with horses. Ok ok, so it'd be mucking out but hey, its stil work and its physical work so it would look good to any future employers. Wahey! Sorted. I think. Moose.
