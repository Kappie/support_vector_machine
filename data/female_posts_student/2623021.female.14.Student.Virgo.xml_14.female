I should have realized a lot of it from the begining. I realize it now though. It all makes perfect sense to me! I was handling a lot of things pretty immaturely. I am going to try to see it from other points of view. I know Daril's and I know mine, and I know a couple other of my friends who have gone through basically the same thing.    Afterhours today! That should be  fun . My mother is on this  crazy kick , she doesn't believe that I'm going and doing what I say I'm going and doing. It's really retarded. She thinks that at afterhours I'll go and get  stoned  which is very wrong. It's  retarded . I hate it. My mother needs to realize that  she can't control my life  one way or another.    My sister is a  bitch!  we just got in a fight because she refused to wait  five minutes  to use the phone because I was online. It ended with me telling her to  fuck off  and calling her a  bitch.  She flipped me off and walked off.
