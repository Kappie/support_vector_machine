It probably won't get posted until tomorrow morning when the novelty of tonight has worn away and all the great lines forgotten. (She wrote as she posted on a tenuous connection.)  Law school parties are fun.  Who knew?  I could have spent a nice, quiet, low-key evening at home with my Indian (as in the continent, not the conquered natives) take-out, laundry, yoga and new book and been perfectly content.  Instead, I risked a night out.  Three weekends in a row!  Someone get the hose!    I was sure I'd arrive at precisely the wrong time.  It was a surprise party after all, set to go off at 845.  Cruising out of the parking lot at 839, I wondered if I should circle the vicinity for a bit.  Again, I risked it, and was again rewarded.  9 came and went with nary a birthday girl to be found.  She arrived soon after, though, genuinely surprised, wearing a tiara with not a single hair out of place.  That takes skill, let me tell ya!    And there was much rejoicing.  Coups were planned, platitude-filled speeches rehearsed, hook-ups promised, shopping tips shared.  Drinking, fucking and heroine were conversation high points.  And somewhere in between the spilled beer, stories about "This guy I know" and lame Laughy-Taffy jokes, we all became a bit closer than we were in class Friday...gasp!  We will absolve ourselves of all knowledge of these activities by Monday, to be sure.  But for now, we have each other!  And it...it feels good!
