Anyway this one was sooooooooo much more fun then the last one, because everyone, or almost everyone was there. Last meet most of our older kids were at ECHO. :)  We kicked butt and got first. So on Monday we'll find out exactly how well we personally did. I'm always excited. Plus I beat at least 3 of my times. :) I need to go, Sorry this is so short, Ellie
