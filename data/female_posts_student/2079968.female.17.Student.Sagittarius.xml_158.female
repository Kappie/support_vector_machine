I've been kinda busy getting ready for the reunion...I have to clean my room and do laundry and pack...finish some shopping. *sigh* The reunion is gonna be super crazy. Almost everyone on my mom's side of the family, contained in two cabins. It'll be fun too, I suppose.  Oh, today I finally purchased a copy of  urlLink  The Screwtape Letters   by C.S. Lewis! I've been wanting to read the book for a while now...Lewis's other works are awesome, and I'm looking forward to reading this...  Anyway, there's still much laundry to be done and packing...a little more shopping as well. *sigh* More later, folks...
