I'm wired and tired right now..Been up all day and night so far. Me and the a.m go hand in hand, ask my daughter! I'm currently going thru the roughest time I'll ever endure in my life. Too young to be saying that you think? Nope..Sorry..I have lived a lifetime of misery(granted not as bad as some..) in a few years. My marriage is past the rocks and dipping it toes in the water already..Its just a matter of who when what and where. My support from family...Down the toilet  nice eh? I need a transition of girl to woman..That- I feel yet as mature as I seem I'm held back in many many ways. I need to better myself that way when I do or he does decide to drop that final bomb, I can handle it and take care of my daughter the right way. I feel skillless..Like I couldn't even succeed at McDonald's. People say I'm wrong yet over the yrs I've gotten so unsocial and like.."outta the loop" that I just feel stupid and I have developed anti-social tendencies times 10. I smoke and I just seem to be smoking more during this time in my life..I am addicted to Mt. Dew..I have severe stomach problems yet I cant seem to take proper care of myself. See that's what I do..Take care of others and neglect myself..That's crap. Noone should really be like that.."You" should always come first..Really. I have had not ONE friend since highschool..Really makes a person feel grade a* special:( I have been very lonely considering I am married. I am only grateful that in this time of my life I have met somebody so special..So considerate and genuine..OMG he's the one I should've been with. DON'T THINK IM MEAN....I am so devoted here at home its sick so no-ones mind be runneth over when reading my blogs mkay!? This person is like my saneness..My strength..My whole heart. Together without physically seeing one and other have fallen into such pure love its just amazing..This is like the kind of love that I wish everyone in life could seriously experience. To be loved for who you are not what you aren't or "could be". A love with a listening ear and a heart of gold. Ok..Ok..My eyes are squinted so bad ..I'm in desperate need of some sleep. As for all who reads me..Get ready for alota' Angmi!
