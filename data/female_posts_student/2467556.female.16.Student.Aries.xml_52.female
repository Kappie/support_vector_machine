SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i played hard and i only fell down like 3 times.  i didn't really knock anyone over today like i did yesterday but it was cool still because MY TEAM WON 6-5!!!!!  WITH A GOAL IN THE LAST 15 SECS!!!!!  Thats right, we rock.  Actually i fell down once pretty hard and landed on my chin, i was afraid i lost a tooth for a sec.  I had to count my teeth, lol.  But they were all there and as i was getting up all the guys started FREAKING OUT like "OMG are you ok!?!?!?!" and i'm like "I'm frickin fine get out of my way, lets play." Still annoying that they did that everytime.  And they kept on going "Are you ok sweetie?" or "are you hurt babe?" or "sorry about that" every time they checked me or ran into me or if i just frickin slipped!!!  aaaaaghhhh when i am playing hockey, I AM NOT A FRAGILE LITTLE GIRL THAT IS GOING TO CRY!!!!  I feel no pain, i just get up and keep on going.  This is the partial reason why my knees are so messed up from the past couple days.  This whole week was pretty awesome.  Sometime next weekend, i'm going to go to the ice rink and practice crossovers etc.    Sports update: Coppell lost to Keller 9-1.......i'm not going to say anymore.  Dallas plays Colorado tonight, $5 they lose 4-2.  At least i get to see my Paul Kariya and Niko Kapanen on the screen at the same time.    Alright, i'm done here, i need to go put ice on my knee and i'm going to kendra's house soon!  Have a good weekend!, ~~~Taylor~~~
