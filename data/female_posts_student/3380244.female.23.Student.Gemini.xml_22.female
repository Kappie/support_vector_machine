And that I know... eventually... some guy will get his head out of his ass and not take you for granted, but only take you as wonderful.  Until that day... you'll stay so close to perfect... and I'll stay here and be there for you every time... through them all... and always there to hear anything that happens... "  all i have to say is, wow.  thank you for that.  though, i think you are a bit harsh on my past boyfriends... it means a lot to know that i have friends that will always be there for me and believe in me.
