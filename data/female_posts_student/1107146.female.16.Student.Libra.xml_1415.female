OOHHH, you can't understand how amazing that is. I just had to stop typing so I could throw back my head and laugh and stop the tears from drowning me. O god. No offense against you or anything, Rosie, it's just the fact that he said.....................THAT!..............and being Chinese and little as he is.............THAT!  And why in the name of the good god who has bestowed your brother with the sacred phrase were you up at 6...you posted at a similar time in my BLog.  HAhahah, I'm going to die.
