Obviously one of those things was school, mainly a specific class, then about just random crap that really made no sense because I was...ranting about...stuff that made no sense...? I ranted about how I feel powerless in a lot of things, there are plenty of things in this world that need...fixing, but how does one go about trying to fix these problems? Like I said...I just feel powerless, and slightly ignorant because I know little things about big situations, if that makes sense, I don't know the whole story. Whatever, I just hope I end up doing something that will make an impact, and I realize I can't just say "oh well I hope..ladeeda" I have to actually make it happen...but yeah, maybe once I'm out of high school I'll have a better view of things. In my science fiction class we have to create a nonhuman society, and describe their way of life, describe how they look, etc... and I like it because it's kind of like creating your own utopia. Everything can be...better.  see..I bet this made very little sense, I don't know what I'm saying.
