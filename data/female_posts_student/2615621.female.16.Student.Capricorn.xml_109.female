But i'll call her up and surprise her and prob chat with whatever hot guys shes hangin out with. :D thats always fun!!   Right now i'm sittin on front of the computer (duh) and i have sunless tanner, which has failed to turn its tan color, and wet nail polish on my nails and toesies. Intresting...and to think i was told by my dad and cousin to use that tanner...lol but i wouldnt wanna go out to church in a skirt with white legs now would i?! nooo esp. when there are hot guys!! lol   I cut my hair today!! Prob about 1 1/2 inches off the bottom and then i relayered it makin more choppier layers. Its the style where the layers flip out..it's very...umm who has it...idk...me? haha lauren had it once.
