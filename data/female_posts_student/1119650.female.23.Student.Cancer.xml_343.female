Garcia*~*  Lots of goings on, but nothing really to write about....  The summer is rapidly winding down, school starts Tuesday and work just keeps on keepin' on.  I have to say though, this has been one of the Best Summers I've had in a LONG time.  From the  urlLink Boston trip , to the Strike Long Island Party,  urlLink Anna's  4th of July party,  urlLink Doogie's  softball game, the Bronx Zoo trip, nights out in the city, random keggers in Shaolin where we tried to fight really big dudes, the Blow Job room at Bar 9, Silent Film Score shows, Bon Jovi Concerts with  urlLink Tazz , trips to Jones Beach, nights out at bars, my birthday, Anna's birthday, God, such great times.  I love all of you who were there to share in it (even if I couldn't figure out how to work in a link to ya!).  You're all truly amazing people and I'm both proud and lucky to call y'all friends.    Okay enough of the mushy, smooshy crap...I'm just in a really great mood.  I dunno why, well, I DO know why (but thats none of your bizniss!).  I think we all need to get together and find a really great way to "Officially" close out the summer, or at very least get crackin' on our Halloween plans or perhaps a weekend in Montreal.  Don't worry, all you underagers can come too.  Montreal is a veritable mecca for the 18+ crowd, legal drinking, gambling, amazing nightlife, the American dollar goes pretty far there and its only a short jaunt across the border.  What do we say, eh?  Oh and I know its not over yet, but  urlLink Boz  totally kicked ass in his Labor Day Weightloss Challenge.  And while we're talking about the other crazy cats in the "Magical Land of Blog" I have to say, I really miss  urlLink Mo .    Thats all she wrote....
