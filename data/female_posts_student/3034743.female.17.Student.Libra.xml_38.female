I dunno, but it had my prom picks on it, so I really do need to find it. I was gonna finish up the role of film on me...no, just kidding....i was gonna take some pics of my nephews...and maybe one or two of myself. I went into my room, and I couldn't find it! Ah! I think that my mom put it away somewhere since I left it on my bed this morning. I don't know, I'll have to ask her when she gets back from the store. Until then I just have to stay calm. Lets see...today wasn't too exciting. We had flan in spanish class...it was pretty good. Got my calc quiz back....yeah I got a 74%, so I'll be retaking that one. In psychology we just looked at many optical illusions, so that was pretty interesting. In physics we finished up some labs....Sam wasn't there for me to hit on. Oh well. I need to find a different hobby besides hitting on guys when I'm bored. Oh well. Hopefully this weekend will be more exciting, but I highly doubt it...it's partially my fault tho. I had offers to do a few things, but I turned them all down....why do I do that? Martin invited me to this party he was going to, and Tommy invited me to his house to watch some movies...and what do I do? I say no. Why is that? I should say yes more often! That is what I am going to do now....I will no longer say no, but instead yes! I dunno, I'm just rambling now...oh well. I say oh well a lot. Hmm....I should go try to find my camera...
