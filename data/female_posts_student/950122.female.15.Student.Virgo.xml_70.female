I stayed up really late last night because we had no school today, so I ended up getting out of bed at around 12 noon. I actually woke up at 9, but it took me three hours of initiative, going back to sleep and thinking of getting up to actually drag myself off the bed. I went online after eating lunch. At 4pm we went to Church because of Ash Wednesday. I almost passed out at mass. O_o I can't really remember it, but we were standing for quite a while, and my chest was starting to ache. Then I got really light headed, and I had to just sit down. Thing is, this isn't the first time this has happened to me. So now, my mom thinks that I'm anemic, because she's anemic. Though it is a possibility, it doesn't sound right. I mean, just because I get light headed when I stand up for a long time doesn't mean that I'm anemic... right?  But enough of that. The only way to really find out is for me to get a blood test. Yikes.
