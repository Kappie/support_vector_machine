Odalis Perez was practically lights out, allowing one run in seven innings; although, Rockies' pitcher Aaron Cook managed to do the same. It all came down to the wire when Royce Clayton came up big with a sacrifice fly to allow Aaron Miles to tag up and score from third in the eigth inning. Colorado had the edge over the Dodgers by just one run.  In the bottom of the same inning, the Blue Crew created their own rallyas theyknocked in two runs to take the lead with Milton Bradley's homerun, and an insurance RBI by Jason Grabowski after Shawn Green singles to left.  "GAME OVER" is all the crowdcould say as their All-Star closer Eric Gagne took the mound to wrap up the night. To make the victory even sweeter, Gagne struckout the side to tie in his 28th save of the year.     San Diego Padres (53-42)defeat the San Francisco Giants (53-44) as the Giants take one step back in the National League West standings, as the Los Angeles Dodgers (55-39) add on to their league lead.
