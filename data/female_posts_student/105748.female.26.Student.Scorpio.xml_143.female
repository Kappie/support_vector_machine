I compare my life to the less fortunate and I just can't help but be thankful. I don't think that it's all a coincidence either. There's got to be a higher power out there watching out for me !  Brian, on the other hand, has always believed in God. He used to always tell me, "How can we be together for ever, if after you die you just turn to dust? I'll be in heaven all by myself ! " Brian doesn't go to church, but we have resolved to start attending church soon to give our future children balance. When they are old enough to make a decision, we will allow them to choose whether or not to continue attending.    Brian's brother Kevin recently lost his job at Sam's Club. He has had a difficult time finding employment because of his felony (teenagers, drug possession). They are working on an expungement. In the meantime, several potential employers have turned him down because of this. He began attending church again.. A good thing.  We are hoping that this will help turn his life around. He is kind of stuck in his high school days (he is my age -- we went to the same school and belonged in the same class -- class of 96 -- we never knew each other, though). He even used to date girls that were still in high school (up until recently) to his parents' dismay. We are all hoping that he'll grow up and mature and look to the future, instead of looking back at the past.    Our siblings aren't really the creme of the crop.. But Brian and I have both decided to still give them the privelege of being Best Man and Maid of Honor. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, however, we have enlisted the aid of a couple of friends. Richard, who is one of the groom's men will be assisting Kevin and Misty, a friend of mine from work and one of the bridesmaids, will be assisting Jen.    Speaking of Richard, he and his fianc Daniella, came over for dinner last Sunday. Yes, they are now engaged !  Initially the plan was to gather all their friends together and propose to her on Valentine's Day (he had already purchased the ring and was just going to hang on to it until then).. However, in light of everything that has happened, he proposed to her on September 11, fearing that if the shit hit the fan, he might not have the opportunity to profess his undying love and affection (think  Forever Young  -- he's just as big of a movie buff as Brian and I are). Anyway, I cooked Menudo for us (I cook a whole bunch, too, anticipating that Jeff -- Daniella and Richard's roommate -- and his girlfriend Karen were coming). Karen was going to bring Flan (one of my favorite desserts), but due to some unexpected complications neither Jeff nor Karen were able to attend (long story, I may tell you later). We played some chess (Daniella recently learned how to play, Richard is playing even more frequently now). I invited Jen to come over and help eat the food.    Speaking of Jen, she arrived bawling.. About that whole thing of being forbidden by Matthew to see their son. Are you ready for this? (You are about to hear Jen's account of the whole situation.) Matt and Jen and their friends Russ and Cora (another couple -- Matt and Russ are best friends and were roommates for a really long time) and Jude (Matt's brother) got together one night and they were drinking (and probably doing drugs, too, knowing Jen) and they got really fucked up. Cora got a bug up her ass and wanted to flash Matt and Jude (yes, they were really fucked up). They were saying that she could on one condition: Jen must mess around with Russ (yes, they were really, really fucked up -- either that or they're just plain stupid -- then again, it might be the second one). A person of sound mind would think, "Gee, this must be the guys' way of deterring Cora from making a complete fool of herself ! " but my  retarded  sister takes it literally and goes on to mess around with Russ. Granted, Matt should have known better. He knows how stupid and unstable my sister is.. I'm beginning to think that he might have done it on purpose to find reason to get mad at her and forbid her from seeing Logan -- but then, I can't convince myself that he is both that smart and that conniving. So anyway, Matt popped a gasket and there you have it. Jen is now talking to a lawyer about taking primary custody over her son.. Which Brian and I both think is a bad idea, knowing her history and knowing how little she cares for him. What do you guys think?
