Close to her breast was a memorabilia of her life, her loved ones and her moments with them. Her breathing came in harmony as she rocks her chair. Around her was a dim light; dim as her vision. There were no voices but the creaks of the windows and the sounds of the wind. As her shaking fingers flipped the album, dots of thoughts and emotions came connecting on her mind. She missed them. She wanted them near, caressing her soft white hair and seeing her wrinkled face wrinkle even more whenever she smiles. One more flip and there was the face of her husband, dead a decade. Staring at her beloved’s face stopped her blinking and gave her eyes the dryness and the sobs with empty tears. A few more flip and children who look like her appeared. They were all wearing smiles; captured to last forever. And so, there were more flips and more faces. The album was heavy as her heart. And as she closed it, heavy tears suddenly came pouring from the windows of her soul. After a short moment of reminiscing, the door suddenly banged with heavy footsteps and voices laughing and talking. Stuff of different colors suddenly filled her blurred sight. The faces from the album are now moving and smiling. Tears of joy suddenly filled her cheeks as she heard tiny, high-pitched voices shouting, “Merry Christmas, Gram!”
