I often use the bathroom in it, because it is close to the study room.  In this bathroom is a much-admired (by me, anyway)  Skinny Mirror.   For those of you onto Harry Potter lingo, I'd have to compare it to the  Mirror of Erised.   For those of you who aren't - it's just freaking awesome, and somewhat hypnotic.  Something about skinny mirrors can manage to cheer up most girls, I think.  It's like seeing dreams fulfilled.    Anyway...  I just didn't pass (i.e. failed) the written ACLS test - by two questions - but a trip to the Skinny Mirror cheered me right on up!  That and the fact that I did well on the HARD part of the test - where I had to pretend to run an actual code (my patient lived!)  Plus, I can re-take the written in 10 days, and I'll be sure to do well then.  NOW comes the scary part of my day: I have my meeting with the Dean and "those three."  I'm really quite nervous.  Breathe... they are only people - people who I used to get along with smashingly.  I can do this.  I am invincible!!!  Well, maybe not, but at least I have a place to go where I can pretend to be skinny!
