I cant wait till its done except for the fact that then i wont be able to see those people again which makes me really sad! I really love these people! All of them...okay minus one or two or three or four or five or six...you get my point. Anyways Zack is getting nicer and sweeter and more into my personal bubble space. Alex is being a dumb ass he likes to take and touch people. He enjoys coming up to you and touching you. Touching your hair and your hands and your face and anything on your face and other things. he enjoys to take your things. Pencils, erasers, journals, books. Freaky huh? Well bryant didnt make it. He went to UCD Library, or he went to the MU. And he stood there and stayed there i suppose for too long. Like he left or something. I feel really bad i kinda didnt want to hop on the bus. He is all by himself over there....i feel awful! Anyways...tomorrow there is another final. Today there was a final, it was kinda sad though. Because you know what? There were only three questions on the test. The test was worth a hundred points, and talk about disaster if you missed one of the questions...!! Ouch! Anyways...tomorrow another final. I have a damn 88% in the stupid class. Im doing ec today...and a kick ass job in the test tomorrow. I mean hey, last time i came out with a 100% on the midterm. Who says i cant pull it off again? Zack was being awfully funny today. He stole my cell phone several times and then he sat on me and he yelled at two people who were making out to get a room...lol. What a doll! Anyways, i must go! Wish me Luck!
