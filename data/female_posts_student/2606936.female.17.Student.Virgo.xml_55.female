It is extrememly similar to recent haircuts of  urlLink Britney Spears  (blech) and  urlLink Lindsay Lohan  (woohoo!), who stars in the movie.  Anyway, so i'm admiring how LL's hair was fixed in this movie, which was all about NOT being superficial, and realize that mine have grown out a lot again. I was going to trim them just before prom, but held off in case of hairstyle problems, and they were just..... everywhere.  So i came home and, having learned my lesson about appearances, cut my bangs.  They are now too short and make me look something like  urlLink this  unfortunate girl, although they are past my eyebrows...  But hey, at least now my lesson comes into use.... i hope.
