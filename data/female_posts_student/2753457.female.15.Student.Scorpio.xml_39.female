And by "did", I meaned copied down the blue words mainly.  I hate that damned book so much.  Ha, wonder if I should go back and read what I wrote, being that I don't remember much at all of what I just studied.  Yes, I will.  I really am determined not to do badly.  Nobody else is going to help me, so I might as well buckle down. Day of silence tomorrow.  Hope I don't crack.  Do I have to start from the moment I wake up, or can I wait till school?  Lunch is going to be weird.  All we do talk and laugh.  We'll probably just stare at each other the whole time.  I will start laughing, I just know it.  Unfortunately I think I will probably do my chorus audition tomorrow.  I am not going to jeopardize that by not singing, the GSA will just have to pardon me for five minutes.  Otherwise, I bet I could go through all my other classes.  We'll see how that goes down.  Alex and I are planning to play charades during Kifner tomorrow if we get a chance to work on the project and I have to communicate.  Ha, he will love that, I just know. Ewww, 4/20 was sweaty.  Krizmanich's room was hot as balls.  Hahaha, that's a funny expression.  And I had to take home a lot of stuff, so my shoulder really almost fell off on the walk home.  But it amused me today that people would blame their sleepyness or fatigue on 4/20.  I was reminded of the chorus trip two years ago when those girls got fliers about it with a drawing of a caterpillar smoking pot on them from some mysterious little shop. I'm listening to this song by The Stills from the February/March Monitor This that I stole from my dad.  There are soooo many songs about heartbreak, as Rob Gordon (NOT from Enloe) was good enough to point out in High Fidelity.  "What came first--the music or the misery?"  Sometimes I wonder.
