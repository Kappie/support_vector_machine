Had to take half my personal belongings into school today to pack into a barrell for D of E, and I just know I'm going to have forgotten to pack something really crucial. As it is I've forgotten plates and cuttlery (quite important!), so i'm gonna have to sit on it tomorrow in the mini-bus. So yes. I just hope that a) it doesn't rain, and b) it doesn't get too bloody cold!!! I think that the cold is going to be the worst bit, having to camp for 3 nights in the freezing cold lake district, with nothing but 5 layers of clothes, a sleeping bag and a lilo for warmth. Hey ho, gotta do these thigns to get places in this world, I guess! Sholud be a laugh though, I just can't help feeling a bit nervous cos we've got to capsize in the lake, and I hate deep water. However, we do get life jackets so it sholudn't be too scary................But I bet I end up in tears whatever happens! Hey ho, so gutys have a good weekend, be back on Tuesday! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
