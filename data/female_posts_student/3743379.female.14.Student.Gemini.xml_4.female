My friend called during me practicing the drums, and it was all funny, because I have to hit them like I'm aiming for the floor, so its pretty loud, and she was like:  "Becca.......... are you trying to play the drums?"  So I go:  "No!  I'm practicing a real beat!"  and she said Jason is laughing at it.    So yeah... I found that funny, so I decided to talk about it.    ...my computer doesn't like me... I'm trying to oekaki, but it won't let me... TT_TT  Its all weird, and now I have to wait a few minutes... I'm an impation ego-maniac.  -_-;;
