I love being in a great mood. It makes me happy and I can see others enjoy it too!      Moving on, yeah like I said, today was awesome. I woke up around 8:30 cause we had some tree trimmer guys cutting on the front tree.  They butchered it.The tree looks awful.So that wasn't too fun. Finally I got back to sleep for a couple of more hours. Then when I woke up I was asked to cut the watermelon. That is some difficult stuff. Thankfully, I still have all of my fingers. Well after I got the watermelon cut I planned on going swimming with my brother and sister. Well, before we could actually swim we all had some chores to do. Yeah, it was weird, my brother was told to do dishes. He hasn't washed dishes here at the house in like forever. Finally we got all the stuff done and by 1:30 we were swimming. It was chilly out, but I did manage to get some sun. Oh, there was a hilarious thing that happened at the pool. Well, we were all swimming and what not when they had some other life guard fake and engery so that they could tape the rescue. So the girl jumps off of the diving board and comes back up and says "O my neck hurts." Then the other life guard blows the whistle and says "Possible spinal cord injury and points then jumps in to 'save' the girl. Well while she is assisting the girl in the water, the other life guard is running with a stretcher and a medical bag. The poor girl falls. That is when I just lost it. The people video taping and the other life guards look at her and are like do we need to help you. It was just funny, I guess you had to be there. So much for there video taping rescue. But yeah, that was funny stuff. Then around 3 we left so Leah could watch Roswell and get ready for work.  Well then I sat around for awhile until Luke and Ryan (some Eagledalians) came over. I went and hid in my mom's room until they left. Once they left I took my shower. I felt so fresh 'n so clean clean...haha. The moment I got out of the shower the phone rang. It was good ol' Bradley (another Eagledalian). He called after his soccer practice to see if I wanted to play some volleyball. How could I resist?!?! I said sure. Brad then says well its just going to be the two of us cause William says he is too sore. So I call that boy up and telling I am going and that too bad he was too tired. He then says I told Brad I might go. So I was like ok. Well, I will see there or I will just talk to you later. Well, Brad comes and gets me around 6. We walked into the Healthplex, signed ourselves in, and then good ol' William walks in. I had a feeling he might show up...hehe. So we all played volleyball until 8:30. It was so fun. The Chineses guys kept picking on me. But thankfully, I just laughed and didn't overreact. After volleyball, I talked the boys into going to the park. They agree, I win! So we all headed over to the park and stayed until 9:30. W had so much fun there too. We were going to play more volleyball or tennis under the lights. But the Mexicans had taken over. What a shame. So we just did all the other stuff there until Brad told me he was ready to take me home. So I said my good byes to William, then Brad and I were on the way back to my house. Brad drops me off at my house and as we pull up I recognize Luke's car at my house. Sheesh. So I go to the backyard and find Luke,Ryan, Heather, and Tiffany (all Eagledalians). They all were in the backyard chit chatting with Leah. So then I call William to see if he still had some time to get back over to my house. But he was already home. Bummer. I talked to him on the phone a bit. I told him if he can't get on the computer tonight to just come back over. I have yet to hear from him. O well. So yeah, here I sit now. My room is messy. That ain't right. I have it cleaned everyday. Looks like I got work to do. Darn.      Ok, I am still full of energy. It is not like I have been drinking any caffiene either. It's weird.  Ahh, I hope the next few days are just as fun. School starts soon for everybody. Everytime I hear them saying about the new school year, I become more thankful that I am being homeschooled. Might I was add, I chose to be homeschooled, it was not something I was forced into doing. Well, with all that said, I am outtie!
