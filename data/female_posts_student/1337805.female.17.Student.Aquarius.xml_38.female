In anycase, I feel like shit, one side of my face is swollen, and I dont wanna move. And what really sucks? School ends on the 17, so now I'm prolly going to fail some classes...> Joy.  The best thing is, I get my lab tests back today...Maybe I have mono instead...wont THAT be fun...  Yes, I'm bitter, and there is no point in pointing that out to me.
