Life was good and I thought nothing could get me down... How wrong I was.  Now don't get me wrong.  Emotionally things are peechy, but physically I could be better!  I developed in the last 4 or 5 days a terrible chest cold... I think that's what it is anyway.  I suppose it could be strep throat, but I don't think so since I don't have a fever.    Still I feel like utter and complete crap warmed over.  I am just hoping I can get over it soon.  My throat feels like I swallowed tacks, repeatedly!  Or more like I swallowed acid.  I feel terrible and if not for my throat hurting and my incessant coughing I would be okie dokie!  I can't seem to sleep and every time I lay down to sleep I have a coughing fit.  So I've been awake for days, 2 to be exact.  Somebody shoot me!  I have a history test tomorrow morning and I have to finish reading a book that bores me to sleep, which causes me to have coughing fits.  Damn!  So on other notes, my posting is picking up.  I just wish everyone else's would.  I write but I can't seem to make everyone else do so.  So what comes of my best efforts?  Not shit the way I see it.  Yet alas I try, and try, and try!  School is just not going my way.  I am about ready to call it quits for this semester and I only have 3 weeks to go.  I am not sure I'm passing Math, especially since I am pretty sure I failed my last test.  History is about to be a complete waste of time since I am not going to be able to sit through my test in the morning on no sleep and half a book read.  Damn, damn, damn..........  Okay, enough of the rampage!  Kristyn
