I have to keep the swearing on this to a minimum because my sister found my other blogs and I really worried she's going to find this one :S she's really, really scary because she spent an age on the Internet trying to find them.  At least Sean found them by accident.  It's like she's stalking me ... and she will not leave me alone about the stuff I said in them!! All the stuff about Mel ... gawd, she thinks she knows everything, and she thinks I'm such a bitch, but she just doesn't know anything.  If she was in my position, she'd be even worse cuz she always gets up on her high horse if she thinks she's been treated badly.  It's because of all her "principles" acting up - she has way too many.  No wonder people call her Principle Girl.  (It's a long story, I've heard it many times, don't ask.)    Whoops, my dad just read that.  The bit about the swearing.  *Beats head against table* I shall slowly lose the respect of my entire family and alienate myself from all civilisation.  I'll just say I meant words like crap, if anyone asks.  HAHAHAHAHAH My sister thinks I fancy Sean HAHAHAHAHAHA (no offence Sean) and she thinks that I don't actually fancy a gorgeous fifth year with dark hair and blue eyes (I haven't told her his name - another reason why she canNOT find this blog!) but secretly I fancy Sean HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  *Clutches side, wipes tear of mirth from eye.*  I am going to go now, before I am caught writing something else ... and I need to look for a scary, scary picture of Zack de la Rocha (he really scares me, and I don't know why).  *~Jools-E~*
