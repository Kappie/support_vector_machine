I am so getting it.   when i made up my mind and my heart along with that to live not for myself but yet for god somebody said do you know what you are getting yourself into when i finally ironed out all of my priorities and asked god to remove the doubt that makes me so unsure of these things i ask myself i ask myself do you know what you are getting yourself into i'm getting into you because you got to me in a way words can't describe i'm getting into you because i've got to be you're essential to survive i'm gonna love you with my life when he looked at me and said i kind of view you as a son and for a second our eyes met and i met that with a question do you know what you are getting yourself into i'm getting into you because you got to me in a way words can't describe i'm getting into you because i've got to be you're essential to survive i'm gonna love you with my life i've been a liar and i'll never amount to the kind of person you deserve to worship you you say you will not dewll on what i did but rather what i'll do, you say i love you and that's what you are getting yourself into   relient K - "getting into you"  Yay.  Go band!  Yeah!  Come support the drumline this Saturday at Marcus HS.  Not sure of the time yet... I'll post it as soon as I know.  Have a good exam week and good luck to everyone going to region orchestra try-outs.  Let's show Duncanville who's boss.
