CONFUCIANISM: Confucious says, "Shit happens." BUDDHISM: It is only an illusion of shit happening. ZEN: What is the sound of shit happening? HINDUISM: This shit has happened before. ATHEISM: There is no such thing as shit. AGNOSTICISM: Maybe shit happens, maybe it doesn't. PROTESTANTISM: Shit won't happen if I work harder. CATHOLICISM: If shit happens, I deserve it. JUDAISM: Why does shit always happen to US? ISLAM: If shit happens, it is the will of Allah. EXISTENTIALISM: Shit doesn't happen; shit is. TELEVANGELISM: Shit will happen if you don't send money. RASTAFARIAN: Smoke that shit. SECULAR HUMANISM: Shit evolves. CHRISTIAN SCIENCE: When shit doesn't happen, don't call a doctor.  HeeHee.
