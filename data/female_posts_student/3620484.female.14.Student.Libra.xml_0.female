I don't know, but I kind of like it.   His arms are strong. Not storng like a great warrior. Not strong like a brave fisherman or stoic ranger. Strong like him. Strong in his own perfect way. He saved me at that moment.  As I stared death in the eye, his arms took me and his voice laughed at the evil. Laughed in its face until the darkness came. A darkness so sweet and smothering that one cannot tell a difference between eyes open and eyes closed. The feeling I had then was like no other I had felt before; though I knew that I would feel it so many more times to come.  The feeling of my soul, compressed and small as a hazelnut, coming to a point at the top of my chest where my heart meets the throat. And it falls quickly, as the hand of the gods let it go, to the bottom of my heart. My heart skips a beat, my pulse pauses and secret shivers none can see pass through my body. That feeling of no match. No equal so sweet. That is when I knew it. I knew it so true and so right that no fool would dare deny it to me. I knew well. I admitted to what I had known since I first met him. Since I first heard his voice. Felt his breath. Had his touch warm mine. I knew then.   I loved him.
