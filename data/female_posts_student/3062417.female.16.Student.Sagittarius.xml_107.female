Later in the night I went back to school though to play tennis with Carol and Kim. Then it started raining so we went inside for an hour until jazz band. We made up a game called smoguntiger. It's so stupid it's funny. Then jazz band was not badish. We got cupcakes and ice cream for Ian's b-day. It was yummy.   Today - Was just another average day. The radio in the cafeteria is finally working so we got to listen to K-Rock during study hall and lunch and stuff today. I had a lesson with Linz today so I got out of English. That's always good. Then there was a field hockey meeting after school. I can't wait till season starts. It's going to be so much fun next year. So we just talked about summer league and preseason and stuff. I'm going to start running tomorrow so I can be inshape and we get to use the weight room over the summer on Tuesdays and Thursdays! I'm so excited. I'm going to be strong! lol Well then Kera's mom gave me a ride home. Then I talked to Carol for a bit on the phone and now I'm here. Oh joy. Well, I've got to go clean my room now because I have a new matress comming tomorrow! Yay maybe, just maybe, I'll actually sleep in my own room now.  Thoughts:  [You can't break me down, You can't control me.] [Don't chastise me for anything I do. I make my own decisions and  I  am the one that must suffer the consequences,  not you .]   Listening To: [Anthem Of Our Dying Day by Story Of The Year]  The stars will cry The blackest tears tonight And this is the moment that I live for I can smell the ocean air And here I am Pouring my heart onto these rooftops Just a ghost to the world That's exactly Exactly what I need  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat Cause I never Never have before  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Of our dying day Of our dying day Of our dying!!!  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city And you gasp for air tonight!!  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Our dying day Of our dying!!!
