My Uncle's house is on a small lake, but it was a little too cold for us to swim in it. It was in the middle of the country so the closest store was Wal-Mart, and then Price Chopper. It was kinda neat not really having to worry about what i look like or anything cuz its not like i'm going to see anyone i know anyway, but i did get ready a couple times just to make me feel better! The weird thing was that whenever we'd go to price chopper or wal-mart, people would ask if we're from out of town... i dunno what gives it away, maybe we didn't have as many holes in our jeans or something... hehe, i guess everyone knows everyone in a small town.    On the way up there i sat by this guy who was i guess around 35 and he talked a lot. Keep in mind it was 6:00 in the morning. He asked me all these questions about growing up and told me that i should do whatever makes me happy for my career, and not base it on money. He was nice, i guess he just wanted to talk to someone. Afterwards, he went up to my dad said that he raised a good daughter. I guess that's nice, i dun really know what i said...   My uncle also has this huge rotweiler (however you spell it) and i would normally be scared of it if i didn't know him, but he's the best dog ever. He's like a huge teddy bear and it just made me want a dog really really badly now.   So tomorrow I've got 4th of July Parade (but the parade is on the 3rd) practice from 8:30-10:30. That should be exciting. I think it's stupid that we have to practice walking in a straight line in step, but i guess it's good that we do so we won't look stupid. Hopefully the parade won't get rained out since i hear it's been raining all week. Oh well, i'm home now and it feels very good.  ALSO, i'm almost done reading the book "The Notebook" so i can watch the movie soon. It's a very sweet love story. I do like love stories. It's kinda sad tho, i'm excited to finish it! This is my first book to read just because i wanted to... i feel so smart! :) And i always thought that i was a little bit of a slow reader, but it turns out that i only read slow when the book is terrible... very interesting...  Welp, i suppose this is enough for y'all to read for now. I missed all of you!!  -Lisa  Song: "Across the Sea"- Weezer
