One, I suspect, he imagines is not quite as threatening as "boyfriend" plainly stated would be. Poor fool.  Completely ridiculous for him to think that, by the way. How could I ever be threatened by an absolute lie? Because he is not my boyfriend, though he calls me "Sugar" (as though  I  am sweet, when I am salt-no, VINEGAR-right through) every night before I go to sleep. He is not my boyfriend, though he is the most patient man I've ever anything-ed. I cannot stress enough the fact that he is not my boyfriend, although...  everyone says he has my number       (and he himself boldly says he is what I need)...   everyone says he knows what buttons to push       (most exasperating being on the planet)...   he can't seem to talk to me enough        (bit stalkerish, huh?)...   he says I have him eating from the palm of my hand       (I can't tell)...   I think about him all day long       (often very inappropriately)...   he categorically refuses to "be used for sex"       (actually said that as he delivered heated ultimatum to me,      which I laughed through as I have not laughed in a very       long while b/c I have yet to "bed" him)...   he told me the second day I met him that I was running from him       (do I have a pair of track shoes tattooed on my forehead?)...   I want to make him laugh, I want to be the reason he's happy       (and that I seem to is such a surprise everytime)...   he keeps coming back even as I tell him the most horribly exaggerated "truths" about how difficult I am to love       (poor thing doesn't know any better than to dance with      Satan's Lieutenant)...   my friends swear they have never heard me talk on the phone the way I do to him to anyone--ever       (and I'd toned down the normal yucky stuff for their benefit)    he doesn't let me bulldoze him in conversation      ( says, "Stop talking-listen" to me more than anything else)   apparently, nothing I've ever said has appalled him       (must be pretending he doesn't think I'm crazy)   he loves that I never wear proper shoes       (as in  really  loves it...nothing more to say on that)...   Finally...  although I say to him, everyday, "What am I gonna do with you?"       (as though he's going to be around for a while)...   But he really, actually isn't my boyfriend. To think it even makes: my throat close up some, my head swim a bit, my heart pound more than normally, my senses rally to keep me from danger.  I don't care what they say--he and his entire army made up of  MY  friends and family--I know who I am. I know what I am doing. This is casual, light, just some fun. Nothing at all of permanence in this. He isn't my type--any of my types, for that matter. I'm not the relationship type. We have nothing in common. Did I say--NOT MY TYPE? Yeah, well, absolutely worthy of reiteration, that.  Please note: do not like anyone thinking they have caught me--and he does. Don't like it a bit. Won't stand for it. Am not made like other women are made where that kind of thing is concerned. I will win.  Or the entire life I thought I was living has been a long, long delusion...a play where the character I don for a while is called "Woman of the Vanguard." And where when I exit stage right, right into his arms, politics aside and reason on hold, I actually am his girl.
