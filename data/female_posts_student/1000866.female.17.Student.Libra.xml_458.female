That's how happy I was to not have to go to school and deal with people. People suck. That's my astute finding for the week. Remember that kids.  I watched Finding Nemo today too which was nice. It made me laugh but laughing made my stomache worse so...yeah. I slept a lot today too. Ah, I sort of wish I were still sick so I would have to miss school tomorrow too.   On the bright side of things, I talked to Bryan for a while. Probably the best part of my day.   I also talked to Chris which was nice. Things are good now so...I'm really happy for him. :)  I kind of wish I could dig myself a hole and go sleep in it until this week is over. I wish I were a hobbit.   OK, I'm going to sleep now definitely. I'm exhausted even though I slept like...all day.
