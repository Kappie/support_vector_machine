At the moment, it's all "you are writing to our french pen-pal" whereas, soon, i fear, it will be "you are a sharing a blog with your French friend" Oh well. We'll just have to be ready for it when it comes, i suppose. Only i won't cos ive only got 2 French exams to go, and THATS IT. NO MORE FRENCH! woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!
