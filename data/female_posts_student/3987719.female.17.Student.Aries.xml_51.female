Adrian Beltre, Shawn Green, and Juan Encarnacion all manage to hit the ball out of the park, producing nine of the twelve runs as a trio.    After the Dodgers' rookie starting pitcher Edwin Jackson goes down with an injury,Wilson Alvarez filled in the rotation and threw a gem byallowing one run in seven innings. He proudlyearned his fifth win of the season with a 3.51 ERA, which is second best in the rotation behind Odalis Perez. Alvarez also helped out the offense by getting a basehit and scoring a run.
