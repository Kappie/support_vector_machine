Last week was finals, I thank every god alive I only had to take four and only really needed to study for one. After that I had another review session and two parties. Both parties had bonfires and we burned decathlon workbooks. I got botany ones! In the words of the illiterate idiocies, score! I hate botany so much. Unfortunately, I forgot my workbooks both times so my personal foes still exist... Damn them! I also came home smelling like smoke from those parties and probably freaked out my mom. That's just a bonus though.  On Sunday, my friend and my sister spent  seven hours  watching the LOTR extended editions.... Never again. I was ready to kill someone at the end of it. I don't understand how those uber fans can stand seeing those movies over and over again. It's just over kill after awhile and it leaves me bored and violent. I can't wait to see Return of the King again though, but I maintain that I need to see it again to absorb it all. There was so much in it!  Anyway, the only other highlight to my week is my never ending war with my beads, which my sister had mixed up and I am eternally sorting them. Half way done though, so maybe the end is in sight...   Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, which means for the next couple days I'll be cut off from the social circuit, which sucks, because I don't celebrate the damn holiday. However... Day after tomorrow more ROTK goodness... Hehe... Yes, I am a sad person....  Write more later Faylinn
