This would be so much more convenient for me, aside from the fact that it'd take me about 20 years to finish school.  This semester is ALREADY getting to me.  I have a project due in my Masterpieces of Music class, and this would be an easy project, except it's to interview a professional musician.  And the musician I was going to interview is out of town.  GREAT!  Anyway, everything else is going good.  I got a B on my first psychology exam.  This I am upset about.  However, in retrospect, I did good considering the majority of the test was extremely hard.  You see, my professor is fond of having questions where 3 of the 4 answers could easily be the correct answer, except one is very detailed, and is the MOST correct answer.  If you don't know all the details of every topic, you're screwed.  :-(  So, I suppose that a B is good, especially when the majority of the class got C or below.  Okay, so, while on the topic of psychology, I guess it would be fitting to mention that the SI (Supplemental Instruction) leader has been trying to make me jealous.  Okay, well, the thing is, I only see him before class.  I have to get to campus like, an hour before my classes start, because if I don't, there's no parking.  So, I just head over to the area outside my lecture hall, and catch up on reading for various classes.  It's proven to be very effective, thus far.  I haven't fallen behind on readings yet.  Anyway, Mike gets there about 20-30 minutes early each class time, too.  He will come and sit near me, and "read" a book, and occasionally peer over the top of the book at me.  When he feels that I've lost concentration for a few seconds, he'll chime in with a question or comment.  He asks me a LOT to come to SI (despite the fact that I've told him I can't).  I tell him that on Mondays and Fridays, I definitely can't go, because the session is at 11 and I have a class.  On Wednesdays the session is at 1pm, and my last class ends at 11:50.  I don't need the help badly enough to sit around campus for an hour waiting for an SI session.  Anyhow, on Wednesday as I'm walking over towards the door to my class, I see Mike sitting on a bench with this girl that sits in front of me every class meeting.  Anyhow, so he keeps looking over towards me while I'm walking over... I mean... I couldn't hear what they were saying... but he LOOKED like he was up to something.  So then I go sit down, and I can hear them, cause, well, they were purposely talking loud.  She said, "Yeah... we SHOULD go out this weekend or something...", and he said, "Maybe I should give you my number....?"  (Note:  This was pretty rehearsed sounding... not like normal conversations flow.)  I nonchalantly look that way, and I see him get this smirk on his face out of the corner of my eye. I think nothing of it, and I go into class.  The girl comes and sits in front of me (as normal... not by MIKE, like you would THINK someone would do if they were going to date).  After awhile she turns around as she's "picking up her pen that she dropped," and she says, "he was trying to make you jealous."  Then she smiles.  Anyway, I didn't talk to him that day.  And when I talked to him yesterday, it was an answer to his request of me attending SI.  I told him what I always tell him.  Whenever he asks me to come to SI, I say, "here we go with you making feel like I'm dumb enough that I NEED SI..." and his response yesterday was, "Here we go with the cute come-backs to my invitation.."  Anyhow, I'm at a point right now where if he wants to go on a date, he is going to just have to ask.  I'm not initiating anything, because truthfully, if I just re-evaluated my life, and decided I shouldn't be in a committed relationship right now, why would I try one with someone else?  Ah-ha!  You see my point...  Anyway, I dunno, truthfully.  :-)  I just know that I'm going to let whatever happens, happen.  I'm not forcing anything.  I'm going to attempt (for a change) to let fate take a hand in my life.  We'll see how that goes.  I'll keep you posted.
