I never have good days that continue. Suddenly I realize that I have been in Hell and Lucy put up a nice visage to trick me. Silly Lucy. I shoulda known you trickster. Ha ha, good day. That was a nice trick! You really got me. Lance, keep a promise. Thats a gosh darn laugh. It's now ten thirty and hour and some time past his so called phone call. I even tried to call with no avail... I'm sure I'll get a nice excuse. Naievity pisses me off.  A lot . I'm doubtful that most of you could fathom how much. People who are naive to things so easily solved just make me want to explode. Tea Kettle. My head pops right the hell off. I mean geez are you that stupid to think that life is a party? It's not. It's a full time job. A job to devote yourself to God and to please him. I'm serious. There are not enough religious people in the world today. Ethics, morals... where did they go? No one cares anymore about how materialistic and evil we've become. When did eating tourtured animals become acceptable? Bearing abnormal amounts of skin? Thinking of yourself before God? What happened to being good? I've got morals and I'm darn proud. I decided after a movie from PETA that affected me very, very deeply to become a vegan. Not a half vegan, not one who drinks milk and eats eggs, a true one. No eggs, unless they are the cage free kind, no milk, nothing with milk including ice cream regaurdless that I work at Dairy Queen, except on occasion. Rare occasion. I am not going to support brutal slaughtering of animals, mistreatment and utterly repulsive lack of respect and brotherhood towards something we share the earth with. I'm done. I am very upset right now on a few different levels, and I just hope that before you talk to me you respect what I have to say and do not abuse or poke fun at it. I do not ask for more.   Kayle    Amen.
