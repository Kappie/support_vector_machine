My apologies to my fans who come and read this obsessively. :) ... This summer, I did research on rats. i took teh MCAT. I became an RA. yes "life as an RA" is good. Believe me, I prefer not to identify myself as anythign besides a Muslimah. every other identity is a peripheral thing. The most important thign about me is my faith. i think I've become more spiritual, but less religious. Does that make sense? It is a common trend in our society, and I hope its not something that is just a fad (liek my vegetarianism back in high school). I am more focused on developing sincerity, havinga good worldview, and trust in Allah to get me through the storms of life, rather than obsessing over the correctness of certain miniscule issues (i.e. make up and stuff). I know I may not be the most "correct" person on earth.. but i am trying to do the best I can while maintaining room to be myself.  I plan to pierce my nose eventually. I don't know when.  ... I'm still a biochem and psychology major.. premed.. I want to go into an MD PhD progtram in the future, hopefully.  ... The latest book I read and loved was "my many colored days" by Dr Seuss.. its one of those cardboard books for toddlers.. btu I'm telling you.. its a LITERARY MASTERPIECE. The latest album I listened to and loved was "look into the eyeball" by david byrne.. which, incidentally, I just burned from my new friend. Adam, just today. :) its really upebat and i like the lyrics. Again though, many of you know my trend of being obsesed with some album for a couple of weeks and then tossing it aside for something novel.. so lets see how this one goes. :)  My favorite movie is hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.. as usual. :) Nothing beats Aishwarya rai's dancing in that flick. I wish I could dance like that.  my biggest pet peeve right now is having a good hair day at 2 am. which is my current state. UGGGH. ... i'm still teh night owl caffeine addict that I've always been..  I'm also idealistic, as usual, and prefer world peace over al the turbulence being caused everywhere. i'm sortve in a weird position as an American Muslimah. And I realized today, that i really dont have any connection, desire, or skill to assimilate into the modern islamic" world in  the middle east.. theres so much cultural, tribal, adn political separation over there, and i find that very contrary to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (saws).  Also, in conclusion, i am doing just fine. i am stressed out (again, as usual).. . I mean, as I mentioned to Ro the oter day, I dumped stress long ago.. i told Stress to get lost.. that I was too good for him.. but he still stalks me.. and I'm working on getting a restraining order.. Any Stress Lawyers out there? take care all. gnight. ma salama
