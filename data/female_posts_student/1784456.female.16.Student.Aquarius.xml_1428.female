Nah just kidding - it's so quiet around here all of a sudden! Apart from people shouting across the IT classroom (Pete, Chris) and Beki obbsesively trying to beat her previous score on Clevermedia arcade. Wow I haven't done any blogging for ages. *sniff sniff* need to excersise writing skills somehow without blogger - argh! It doesnt help being a slow typer, it takes ages to convey anything! The should invent computers where you could just write with a pen on theis board-thing and the writing would come up on the screen! WoW! I'll just be sending plans off to microsoft now... nevermind if they're evil...how are they evil exactly? I'm a very anti-evil anti-capitalist anti-globalisation kinda person but what have microsoft actually done? I'd be interested to know. Oh well there's always Intel. Im just blabbing randomly now (It really is quiet without you, katie!!!) so anyway... don't you feel like a chopping board? Damn, I alwyas get that feeling. Uh huh.    Soooooo anyway I'm kinda pooed off cause its all sunny for a change and im  having to spend my lunch time in the PC room AGAIN doing graphics stuff...boooooo...GET BETTER!!
