I heard my name, I heard it all. I stomped home. A rare occasion where you actually stomp. I felt like the heated devil. I was mad. I thought about them, who were they to judge me? I don't care what they think but I care what they do. They don't care what happens to people that they pick on. Something weird happened. This thought started to make me feel better and I held my head my high (I never do that) And I thought  I don't care what any one thinks.  I was still stomping though. But then I got stuck behind this year seven who stopped in the middle of the path for a bit and then started walking. He made me laugh. Thanxs mate. So I didn't feel like the heated devil, I felt like the devil wearing a frilly pink tu-tu on ice. :) Just spreading some happiness (rare). Don't care what any one thinks, especially bitches. Oh and by the way... DEATH TO LISA BODEN. Hey, I can be a bit angry can't I?
