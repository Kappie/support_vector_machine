I woke up uber-late and missed 45/50 minutes of Women's Ensemble rehearsal; the results consisted of a rather long speech about tardiness and making an effort to be there on time-- particularly those of us who are perennially late (Ms. Bizarth's stare shifted from Sarah to me alternatively as she communicated her concern). Then Chemistry. It was pretty decent for the first half of the block although I was still attempting to awaken, but eventually I started feeling rather awful. I took some pills. History... er, well, there was a test, and I didn't really exactly prepare for it too well, and History is possibly my worst subject. I'm not sure that went as well as I'd hoped. Calculus was pretty fun. I took a quiz, too, and I felt pretty confident about it *knock on wood*. Choir was... hm. So-and-so. I've had to start bringing a can of Dr. Pepper to school with me because I run out of energy by the time fourth block rolls around. Yesterday, I gulped it down in the six minutes that we are allowed for class change--immediately before chorus. Bad idea. Today, I was smarter and drank it during lunch, over the course of half an hour. I think it worked out far better, as I was awake in AP Quackulus AND Chorus!      I got home from a French Club meeting a while ago, and it was pretty fun. We made chocolate mousse. I didn't really know what to do; I was mainly the cleaning person. Patrick made the mousse in our group, mostly. He let me do some of the mixing, and even then he had to tell me exactly what to do, as I am culinarily challenged. It was kind of fun to watch him throw dirty looks at Craddock, who was being his annoying, jerkish self to him. It seemed as though Patrick really wanted to bash his head in. I would have helped him. ^.^  Well, I'd better go eat dinner and get some homework done.     "Sing me to heaven" by Jane Griner   In my heart's sequestered chambers Lie truths stripped of poet's gloss. Words alone are vain and vacant and my heart is mute. In response to aching silence Memory summons half-heard voices, And my soul finds primal eloquence and wraps me in song.  If you would comfort me, sing me a lullaby. If you would win my heart, sing me a love song. If you would mourn me and bring me to God, Sing me a reequiem, sing me to heaven.  Touch in me grief and comfort; Love and passion, pain and pleasure. Sing me a lullaby, a love song, a requiem. Love me, comfort me, bring me to GOd: Sing me a love song, Sing me to heaven.
