This is not sophistry. And this is not hypocrisy. This is reality. I have sex with men. But unlike every other man of whom this is true, i bring the guy i'm screwing to the White House and President Reagan smiles at us and shakes his hand. Because what i am is defined entirely by who i am. Roy Cohn is not a homosexual. Roy Cohn is a heterosexual man, Henry, who f***s around with guys." - a quote.
