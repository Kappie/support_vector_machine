Why am I so easily distracted?  Somebody said to me a few days ago that I must be a total third wheel to Mattee and The Angel.  I tag along, and show up for their late night burn sessions, though granted it's often just me and Mattee.  Sometimes The Angel creeps me out a bit.  When I told her about the problems I was going through with B-Dizzy she just sort of smiled, and a few chuckles slipped out.  Hmm, that doesn't seem like the kind of stuff that friends do.  When Mattee cried on my shoulder about The Angel, I didn't laugh.  Although, perhaps that's the point: she doesn't want him, but if there's someone else gunning for him (which I am NOT) then she's gonna make it at least a little hard.  Ani hasn't called, neither has B.  None of my romantic interests are ringing my bell, only my metrosexual Mattee.  Well, if I go for a bun right now, my chances of getting home at a reasonable time (WITH comments for my anthro paper!) are a lot better.  With  urlLink Quannum  approaching (and I got my ticket today!) I've been listening to an excessive amount of hip hop.  Totally neglecting my punk-rawker roots.  But I LOVE Mos Def.  Seriously, much love for Mighty Mos.  And he is just delicious!  Meow!  OK- Time to go bun.  Maybe I'll have some stoned thoughts when I get home and should really write my paper, but actually just waste my time blogging (gaaaah.)
