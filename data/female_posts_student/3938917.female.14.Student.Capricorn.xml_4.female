But, when there's only one thing I ever want, and I can't get it on account of them, it angers me greatly. Oh well, I suppose I'm just a silly girl. But I miss him...and want him...and need him. I'll get to him somehow, for now I just have to cuddle with his shirt and call it good. But anyways, yesterday was filled with bore as usual. I hate it that everyone has a job and never can do anything, but I guess that's just part of life right? Right. Stupid Girl just came on,and I haven't heard this song for a really long time. Maybe it's a message to me that I'm a stupid girl...but don't they know that I'm already aware? Apparently not. But what can a girl expect? I don't know. Well, I don't really have anything to talk about since everything's been so boring...so I'll leave you with one final message...Goonies NEVER say die! Hehe!
