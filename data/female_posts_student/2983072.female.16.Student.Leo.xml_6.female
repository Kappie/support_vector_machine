She came to meet my teachers and crap...not that I had been bad or anything...^_^     She just wanted to say hi, except for my math teacher, mom thinks she's the anti-christ.  I think all the guys in my world history class were disappointed when they found out the new "hottie", (using that term loosely) was my mom and already engaged.  It's fun having a mom that thinks and looks like a teenager.  Heck my dress code is basically "If I can wear it, you can wear it too" If it fits that is, because my mom is 4'11, where as I'm about 5'1.  The only flaw in this arrangement I've found is that having your mother look better than you half the time can get quite annoying. Bleh, whatever.  *Goes to get her comfortable sweatpants and baggy shirt.*  Screw looking good for the time being...I think I'll go burn the cosmetics while I'm at it too.
