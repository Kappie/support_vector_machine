I can't remember the last time I wrote in this blog. Like 2 days ago? Something like that. I have a lot to say. First on the agenda is someone I see every day who I feel sorry for. This person: 'x' is a guy. He's a freshman, and that's all I'm saying about him. I see him on buses and in the auditorium and he's always by himself. And when we were marching for band today: he was standing there all alone watching us. I feel sorry for him. Maybe he's going through a depression? I don't know. Second, we took the TAKS today. Yah- woopdeedoo lol. That look's funny typed out. :)  Yah I had an argument with my BF today and I think we sorted it out... It's very stressful for me though. This weekend, let's see. Car wash tomorrow, working on science music video afterwards. On Saturday, parade, then Travis B's house? I dunno. Oh yah, and Steffy is staying over from Saturday to Sunday. My life is so confusing. Love, the Confused One
