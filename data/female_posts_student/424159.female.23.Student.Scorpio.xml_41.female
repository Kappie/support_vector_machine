It contains nudity, violence, and some pretty fucked up shit.  While some skits are downright hilarious, others should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and the other Jackasses do everything you could imagine and more:  Shocking their genitalia and other body parts, lighting firecrackers from their asses, sticking Matchbox Cars in their asses,  majorly distressing Mr. and Mrs. Margera, beating the holy shit out of each other, and other stuff that makes my stomach hurt just thinking about.  While it's refreshing to see such garbage do well in the theatres, I'm aftraid I really can't suggest this movie to anyone. __________________  2.  8 Mile  ***  3 stars (out of 5)      Ahh....Eminem's debut movie.  What else can I say?  The movie was decent.  Eminem is surprisingly good as an actor, to add to his rapping talent.    The movie is based on a character "loosely" based on Em and his life.  8 Mile, while maintaining my interest and curiosity, was well worth the money paid.  However, I feel the movie would have been better if it was actually about Em, and had not ended on the note it did.  It would have been nice to see how Em rose out of the obscurity of Detroit's trailer courts.  Amen.  I would definately recommend this movie.
