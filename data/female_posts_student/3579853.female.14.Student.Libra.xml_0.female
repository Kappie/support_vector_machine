Two weeks ago she had offered to take me to the mall near it, and to give me my clothes allowance early.  To a girl with no transportation, it was the perfect deal.  Plus, whenever I get my clothes allowance I get an itch to spend it.  We had lunch at a nice place called the Twisted Fork.  I had Seafood Pasta and it was really great.  I wish I could've eaten more of it, but for some reason I got full pretty quickly.     There was supposed to be a car wash today.  Unfortunately, it rained.  However, my mom thought I should still go and see if they were still going to have it.  The place where it is usually held is only about 3/4 miles away from my house, so it was all good.  I rode my bike over there, and got drenched.  Two people were there, telling people there wasn't going to be a car wash.  They saw me, and one asked what I was doing.  I replied that I had never before ridden during a rainstorm, and that it was a new experience.  I actually thought it quite exhilarating.  It was absolutely pouring by the time I turned and headed for home.  There was standing pools of water on the sidewalks, and many times did I get splashed.  When I reached my house, my old shoes were full of water and sloshed when I walked.  Contrastingly, my head was perfectly dry, due to the raincoat I had slipped on before going out.
