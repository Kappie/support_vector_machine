I don't remember what I did for the rest of the day, but then at about 5:30 I went to play tennis at Mount St. Mary's for a while. It looked like it was going to storm, so we left. After that, I watched the Cubs beat the Cards (finally), and I played on Xbox Live with a bunch of crazy guys. Heh. I guess I lost track of the time while doing so. Good night.     Last song I listened to:   Don't Tread On Me  by Metallica.   Last album I listened to:   Metallica .   Last meal I ate:  Salad, bread, and pasta at Sweet Tomatoes.   Last movie I watched:   For Your Eyes Only .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Again, I played my saxophone today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I just started naming off the elements today while I was in Office Depot. And they were selling periodic table posters there, too.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.   Favorite song today:   Outlaw Torn  by Metallica.   Favorite food today:  Don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Looked for a new digital camera in Office Depot.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Hahahaha, Steph. That is way too funny and ironic. I won't elaborate any further.
