Didn't go to Earth Science because I had a test I didn't study for, and Nick didn't want to go. Unfortunatly, Nana came too, so it was sorta...no fun. Went to English, wrote a lame song for the entire class. Creatively skipped Multimedia, walked into the park with Nicky. We found a really private, gorgeous spot to sit by the river. Made out there for a bit, then walked back to the school.   Went to Laura's after school, called Dad, he freaked out because Ms STUPID HEAD Smirl called and tattled on me for skipping. Stupid broad. SO he came an picked me up, I spent my last few minutes with Nick, and left. I have never wanted him more than right then, I really wish I had never called home.   I'm all packed to go now, last minute changes, I'm bringing Easter Kitty (my present from nicky) and my cell phone with me, so I can still have a part of Nicky, and call anyone. If yas wanna chat with me while I'm away, try me at 885-8586. Leave a message if I've turned off the phone.   I miss Nick terribly, his touch, his voice, his kiss, everything...I miss the way he whispers something sweetly in my ear then licks it (even if it is annoying). I just plain ol' miss him, and wish I didn't have to leave him :( I really really hate Ms Smirl right now for ruining my day.   I love you ooglies, everyone, miss you bunch, and I'll see you all hopefully on Tuesday when I get back. Ciao.
