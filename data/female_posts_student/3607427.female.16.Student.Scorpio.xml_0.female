Conclusion: Well, simply because that particular audience who watched the movie and find it boring and gave a low rating, it doesn't mean that I will find it boring too! and there is simply more to watch and observe other than whether or not hallie berry is not that kind of sexy or how their outfit crings out the "shape"!  It's only when i watched the movie, before the critics can actually be published, that i truely enjoy the movie. If not, i will be bring a very reluctant mood into the cinema and come out saying, "it's not bad after all" or a very anticipating urge coming out with "it's not as facinating as expected!"  Maybe, that's got to do with my expectations for the movie. Nevertheless, don't ever read critics! Just buy yourself a ticket and a cup of pop corn (and of course the movie ticket! -_-) and sit yourself in a very comfortable position and ENJOY YOUR MOVIE! YEAH~!   theory behind this: when u read critics, there is already an image created in your brain, telling you what you are going to expect. And normally what you expect and what you experience are totally different!
