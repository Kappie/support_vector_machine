Whatever you decide to do today, whether it's throwing scruffy old ladies off a bridge or kicking greasy piglets in the groin, whatever it is  urlLink DO NOT GO TO GOOGLE IMAGES AND TYPE IN "ULCER" !  This is a code red, folks! Do not  urlLink click this link ! You're a sick, sick bastard if you'll decide to  urlLink click this godawful link . I know it's tempting. Everything that isn't allowed is oh so tempting, like  urlLink clicking this link . But you  can  fight the temptation, just like Jesus did in the Garden of the Pickled Breast, or wherever it was. I saw the Passion, but didn't pay much attention because  urlLink they did not have a link to this particular page . You know why not? Because  urlLink this link right here  is  urlLink a link to a terrible page  obviously created by a bunch of filthy sinners, like you and me!  So, don't  urlLink click this link , okay? I'm just being a good Samaritan today. It's my good deed for the year, warning you not to  urlLink click this link .  Alright. Now that we have that settled. I should be off with roomie, if she's up for it, to see Troy tomorrow. I'll let you know if it's any good and if they have provided somewhere in the movie a  urlLink link to this page .
