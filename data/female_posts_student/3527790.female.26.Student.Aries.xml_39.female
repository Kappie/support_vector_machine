Well it has taken my til today (three days later to decide which of my war stories I was going to tell you.   Let me start at the beginning...I ended up staying in this seedy hotel. It was quite funny I mean it was straight out of a movie the kind of place that a married man would take his lady of the night. The door looked like it had bashed in a few times. The springs in the bed were shot! One of the beds was actually on a downward slant, the top left hand corner was a good 4-6 inches lower than the rest of the bed. Needless to say I wore my flipflops in the shower and DID not sleep in the sheets I had thankfully brought a sleeping bag! The TV had a grand total of 3 working channels two of which you kind of needed to play with the rabbit ears in order for them to come in. What a riot. But it did have a mini fridge and a microwave so I was happy.   Race morning I woke up and it was a beautiful day out and I was pumped to say the least! The race went well. Except for the fact that I got kicked pretty hard in the swim in my tummy which slowed me down. Thank goodness I had the wetsuit. I probably wouldn't have made it without it! The bike was faster from last year by 3km/hour and my run was two minutes faster. I probably could have gone a bit faster on the run but I was being a bit conservative because of my knee.   The things that I was happiest about the race were that my knee did NOT act up at all. And I had a blast! It was such a fun race. I got a huge case of bike envy as nice bike after nicer bike flew by me. But my little Meile did just fine. AND I beat my previous years time by 5 minutes So I was pretty happy with the results.   I am thinking of doing another not this weekend but next weekend just for the practice in the water. But we'll see I need to talk to my friend who lives in Guelph and see if she is going to be around and if I can crash at her place. So time will tell.   I love being a triathlete! It is such an amazing feeling!!
