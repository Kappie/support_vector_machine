Of course this is not due to my procrastination at ALL. La la la...and yet...I sit here observing all the tiny different colored dots that make up my computer screen. There's a little green one and a blue one and...OH! There's red! You have to have red.  AHHHHHHH. I think I need to go hit myself over the head with one of those stupid little kid's plastic wiffle-ball bats several times. That'd distract me even more for another good...hour or so. :) YaY. I've also come to realize something. Hiccups are extremely unattractive. I wonder if anyone has ever gotten them on their wedding day. Surely..someone must have. Hah. That''s going to be me. Leaning in to kiss the love of my life and...HICCUP! Oh...excuse me while I go drive blunt pencils through my eyes.   OK, seriously. I'm going to do this. I AM! You just watch...actually...I hope you're not watching. That'd be rather creepy.
