I like having at least one morning a week to go in later..not to sleep in, but to enjoy the world again on my terms. Besides, class ran late last night. I didn't leave until 22:00. My instructor was more himself last night at least. He actually taught class and caught us up to chapter 6 (even though I've practiced thru 7..he's catching up with me :D)   I got to be the body again. :D The older lady in our class got to finish my left side.."bless her heart." I love her, but I can't see her as a LMT. I know she means well, but she has no finesse. She couldn't breathe, that's a big contributor. I helped her though. I should have given her massage first. It's amazing to have her strongly wheeze with every breath and do a little deep tissue and it helps all that gunk out.   My focus will be to continue to let go and release my helping hands to do their duty.   With love and living,   BLG   P.S. I enjoyed the clinic yesterday. The girls at Classic Cuts are already calling me their new Massage Therapist, even though I haven't even done any there. I go in their to get my hair done and she introduces me to everyone. She so sweet. She wants me in their open house picture. I'll have to make up my mind about that one, and think about the legalities. I don't want to get in trouble before I start.   I also enjoyed seeing my heart's desire. It was wonderful just to be in his presence.
