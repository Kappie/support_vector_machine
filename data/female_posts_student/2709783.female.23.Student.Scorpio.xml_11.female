Now, I'm sure they meant mosquito-repelling products and just didn't have enough clear plastic letters for the sign, but the possibilities are endless.  Handmade mosquito-wing apparel?  Packaged itchy spots?  A malaria vaccine?  Baby mosquitos?  Tiny straws?  I've been torturing myself about feeling excited that a co-worker will be taking medical leave for a month soon.  After today, I no longer harbor these feelings of guilt.  I will enjoy every day without the running soundtrack of bitches and moans and not consider myself a bad person.  I will also be keeping a running counter of the days until there is no one across the office from me.    As of today:  6 working days (not counting today) until I work in a happy, healthy environment.  That doesn't seem like so much until you consider the fact that I work 10-hour days.  I think I'll do an hourly countdown instead.    63 hours until I am no longer in danger of becoming a disgruntled worker.
