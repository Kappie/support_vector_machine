My aunt had these chicken eggs that she was trying to hatch, but she kept them in the fridge. I went to check on them and they were hatching. One turned into a mouse. It was the size of a rat, but it was a mouse. Then it got in a fight with my cat. The second egg turned out to be a duck. The third was actually a chick, it was really cute, but I picked it up in my left hand, and grabbed a fork in my right, and started to eat it! I ate a living chick! It was horrible! Then I went to Elizabeth's house to get ready for BLINK ME BABY! We went to go get some sneakers and the guy working was so adorable. He looked like an Andrew/Brian from J Rev guy. I had a gift certificate, and he used it and then I asked how much I needed to pay for the balance, and he was like, "$40.42" and I said, "No, but how much after using the gift certificate?" And he goes, "OHH I wasn't thinking! $3.14!" It was great. I also bought some Harry Potter trading cards. SO EXCITING! We went to Germain at like 3:30, but they wouldn't let us in! People just started parking their cars in front of the line and then everybody was partying it up. People played music and it was crazy. We could hear Blink doing their soundcheck, Tom sounded like shit. I danced in the sunshine to their music, AHH I LIVE AND BREATHE TOM DELONGE! I did something and Elizabeth goes, "You're deaf AND blind!" And at the exact same time we go, "HELEN KELLER!" It was great.  They let us park and then people sprinted to the gate. We saw Patrick from Fall Out Boy with his... GIRLFRIEND! AHH NO! She aws pretty and cool, but she had to wait in line with everybody else, poor kid, no backstage pass for her. Elizabeth and I wanted to sneak a camera in. We come up with this idea to wrap it around Lizzie's ankle. But we get in line and we haven't done it. So I go to a corner and tie it aroud my ankle. It looked bad and everybody around was like, "Yeah they're gonna frisk you there." So this girl tells me to put it in my bra like she did. See, she had a disposable and Lizzie's is this big awesome zoom mother. Putting it right between the boobs (ps this is going to be a bit graphic)didn't work, you could see the buldge. So she tells me to put it under one of my boob. AWKWARD! So these girls all huddle around me so I can physically lift my boob up to slip the camera under. People were watching, it was fine. The girl coms to frisk the people, but she only did the guys. I felt really bad, cause she was pretty, and all the guys were like, "OOH watch the goods" and other stupid guy stuff. I would have grabbed it and been like, "Watch the good? This stuff should be on clearance, baby!" I don't know, I thought that was funny. She looked in my bag and I was pulling stuff out but it was really difficult, so I was screaming "I'm sorry, I'm just a groupie!" Crazy. We ran to the FOB stage. The girls who helped me put my camera in my boob were crazy. Any time one of the girls talked to you, she'd grab your boob, it was crazy. There were these weird kids all wearing white t-shirts with a green heart in the middle of a recycle sign, it was odd. They stood on each other's shoulders and stole guitar picks from the stage. I didn't get one, but more on that later. FOB was good. It got wild and I was pushed to the side. But they did a good job. After, we ran into Eri and Chels... LOVE THOSE GIRLS! We all went to see Pete, right when I got up there I heard Taking Back Sunday come on, I shouted right in his face, "I NEED TO GO!" He was just like, "I'll be out here, come back later!" Lizzie and I sprinted, SPRINTED up the hill trying to get to our seats, it was crazy. Nobody was excited for TBS, but we were FREAKING out. I love them! Then we went and talked to Joe from FOB. This guy was taking a picture for us, and he asked how we got the camera, and Lizzie was like "Oh she had that in her boob!" Hi, Joe, nice to see you again. NO, it was really funny. Then we talked to Patrick, ahh he was really nice this time. During TBS I saw a guitar pick fall and I pushed Lizze to get it. She got two picks at our last concert as well, I have ZERO. So to Patrick I said, "Hi, she always gets a guitar pick, but I never do, do you have any?" And he pulls one out of his pocket and told me it was his last one and gave it to me! It was so great. Then I held my fist in the air and grunted, he tried to do it to and said, "I really want to be able to make that noise" and I did it again, oh we are friends. Then we met TBS, I slapped hands with them all, Adam is dreamy (ahh it's like my BSB days, NICK CARTER!). Then we saw Cypress Hill, what the HELL were they doing there? They had an inflatable Buddha holding marijuana on stage. The lit a bong on stage, it was just funny and bad. Blink... where do I even begin? GREAT. Well, they didn't talk/be funny a lot. They could have, and they only played for like a hour, IF THAT! My mom thought that was bs, she was like, "They should have played 2 hours!" And I agree. We took pictures when the mean security guard left and the cool one came. Liz was up in their grill. One time I just ran over to the cool security guard and screamed, "I LOVE YOU, I'M JUST SO EXCITED!" He laughed. I would jump into the aisle and sing and dance, I swear Tom laughed, and don't you try and make me believe he didn't, I'M FUNNY, WE ALL KNOW, AND HE WANTS ME, IT'S FINE. HAHAHA! During the show they suddenly wheeled Travis off, cause his leg is broken, and he appeared from the ground between the two parts of the pavilion, it was amazing. They are brilliant. After the show we saw people standing trying to see them, so we joined. I asked the security guard if there was a chance to see them, she said no, then we talked about how they cannot meet the bands or anything, I said, "Your job sucks!" and she screams, "NO MY JOB IS AWESOME!" Alright, calm down. We went to Steak n Shake it was good. Fun was had. Yesterday I went to see Mae in Indianapolis with Anna, oh god it was crazy. We get there and I called my mom to tell her we were there, I told her the time too, Anna's car said 5:45. Then I hung up my phone and my cell says 4:45, I got really confused. Anna and I were so freaked out and confused, I mean who would have thought that there is a time change when you go to Indiana, NOT ME! It was so funny. We had to wait in line for like 2 hours with the WEIRDEDST people ever. This kid, Joey, was on something STRONG. People were smoking like crazy, too.  The first band was good, the second band, Project Bottlecap, was weird. This really big guy had the girliest voice ever. He convulsed every time he moved as well. The Working Title is really googd. Anna really likes them, and didn't know they were coming, so it was a big surprise. The lead singer is dumber than shit though. During Mae they brought out cupcakes, couple of the guys were celebrating their b-days, and he lit one and started walking over to give it to the guy, but he was like fighting the air so they wouldn't blow out, oh it was hilarious. Mae was good, I couldn't remember any of the words though. Anna is TIGHT with all of the, they remembered her and were hugging her. I was secretly jealous! They were nice and we talked for a long time. Then we drove home, got in around 4, CRAZY! I can't blog anymore or I will go crazy. Sorry this was long, I'm out, bye!
