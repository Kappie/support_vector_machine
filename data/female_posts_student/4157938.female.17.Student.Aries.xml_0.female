I get tiny mild tooth aches alot and they usually just go away and don't mean anything. This tooth ache continued though... this kind of dull, throbbing, annoying pain. I could eat fine though so I ignored it until it was time for me to go to sleep.  Once I laid down the pain became unbearable. Again I though it was just some meaningless, stupid aching so I kept trying to rearrange my pillows to find a comfortable spot. The pain kept on and at about midnight I still hadn't fallen asleep, so I went to the bathroom and downed four advil. The advil helped for about 30 minutes and I fell into a very light sleep.  30 minutes later I woke up again from the incredible pain in my jaw. I went to the bathroom and looked at my teeth in the mirror and I couldn't see anything wrong with them. It felt like their was someone in my mouth with pliars sitting there putting constant pressure on my tooth trying to pull my tooth out. I took two more advil and again went into a light sleep for about 20 minutes.  Around 1 am the pain was back and my jaw was throbbing as if I had just been punched there about 30 times. The pain wasn't as bad when I stood up or sat, so I got up and read my book,  Master and Commander  by Patrick O'Brian.  Around 2 am the pain had just gotten worse so I went and told my mom who said all she could do was get me a dentist appointment in the morning; she gave me two tylenol and suggested I put some ice on it. She was somewhat right with the tylenol and the ice combined I managed to fall into yet another light sleep, waking up about every 10 to 20 minutes.  Finally, the morning came and once I got up my tooth didn't hurt too, too bad so I got ready for school as usually and joy of all joys it was raining so I got soaked getting into the building :( grrr. During first period I ate my breakfast and did some homework but my tooth was throbbing. I called my mom on my cell and she got my an appointment at 8:20 which was only in about 10 minutes... I was apprehensive but relieved.  The dentists checked me out and took x-rays and my mom's fears were right, I had an abscess in my tooth. Now, I didn't quite know what that meant so:   ab-scess   (n.)  A localized collection of pus in part of the body, formed by tissue disintegration and surrounded by an inflamed area.  ... yup that pretty much covers it. So, the dentists squeezed me into their schedule and operated on it right away. Unfortunatley, ever since I had my bad experience with getting a "small" cavity filled with no freezing and after getting four wisdom teeth removed, I am deathly afraid of the dentist. So, before they froze me I was kind of having a little panic attack and shaking all over. Pretty much the operation is the same as a root canal... they kill everything inside of the tooth and they kill all the nerves, so your tooth is dead and has no feeling to it but it's still in your mouth.  I had half a frozen mouth, I was drugged with pain killers and laughing gas, and I was going on about 2 hours of sleep, so, understandably I took the day off of school. I go back next Thursday for them to continue the operation... that's right this was only the first part of it.  So pretty much I've been sleeping the whole day... fell asleep during the Olympic badmiton (no idea how to spell that) game... but I hope Great Britian won.
