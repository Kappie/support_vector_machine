So now, right here, I am going to list all the things that were just wrong and biased with that whole thing. I should have stood up and said all this stuff at the talks, but I didn't think to do it. Luckily I have a blog. Tehehe. 1. That whole thing about "nowadays everyone builds their marriages on unsturdy foundations and that's why they get divorced. It used to be that people would get married and stay together" Yes, people did stay together fifty years ago, but that wasn't because of solid foundations, that was because if they got divorced, no matter how miserable they were, they would become somewhat of an outcast of society. Today people can get divorced without being shunned. 2. What was that crap about "being pure." Like that guy who proposed and gave her a diamond and said "this is how pure I think you are." What the hell kind of proposal is that. I would beat the hell out of any man that EVER used the word "pure" to compliment or insult me. That is just so condisending, like "Well I'm a virgin and you're not and I'm really too good for you, but I want to be with you anyway." And also, that guy was supposedly a genius; he got his master's degree in four and a half years, BUT he proposed to a girl who is a sophmore in college and is dropping out to get married. What the hell are they going to talk about? And she is going to hate him by the time she has their first child because she never got an education, and since she didn't get an education she can't get a good job, she is going to be a house wife, with NO life. That marriage just has "doomed" written all over it. 3. The guys did NOT get the same talk. They didn't get that "sex is emotional" speach. If the goal was to educate both genders and not to make the girls look like whores. Why exactly is it always on the women to be virgins?  ok. I've said my piece.
