This is really wierd considering that I got ten hours of sleep, just the perfect amount for me. Well what ever.   Yay I managed to get my SIN number today. Good good good. Well I didn't actually get the number I got the slip of paper saying that they will give me one. This means I can check that little box off on my applications that says I'm legally allowed to work in Canada. Always a good thing. I'm very tense lately maybe I need a neck rub.   Hummm Went and saw Troy and Shrek 2 last night. Both were excellent but if you are going to see a movie in theaters go see Troy. People keep going on about the beauty of Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, but I thought that Eric Banna was the most atractive. I think maybe because in chacter sence he was the best. Brad did a good job too. Orlando was good but his character was a total pussy. I did not like Paris. Of course Beth will say that he was the cutest because she likes her men to be the equivalent of veal. Translation: She likes tham to look very sheltered and kind of baby faced. I like my men to be real. I'm talking they need flaws, they need some muscle and they need a personality that doesn't radiate adoration. Maybe that's wierd but damn it that's what I like.   I know I was going to say something else but My fingures are beginning to go numb and that meens that my carple tunnel syndrome disagrees with my typing. Must go now and take pills to stop the pain.
