Remember before when the dreams consisted of elements of life that weren't right? This was all of them combined, I think, the world simply wasn't right. A song set it off,  Numb  by Linkin Park. I fell asleep with that song in my head and it played through most of the dream, and moreover, the chorus. Look up the song sometime, try  urlLink here . I'm not sure why but it did.  Silly chronicles of life.
