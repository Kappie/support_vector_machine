Bad news first: my lab partner person's transformation was bad... The agar got toasted since the plate wasn't covered. Good news: There were extra bacteria so we could regrow them. Only problem is the 24-hr delay. Good news: MY PCR DIDN'T GET RUINED! I'm just happy that the machine broken near the end of the program since it all replicated without a problem (at least for set one and two). I found negative and positive results, so it wasn't a fluke. The results were real, I suppose.  Anyhow, my break is about to be over... The gel is almost set so I need to check the rest of the sets. Phew, I hope they are all perfect little PCR products...
