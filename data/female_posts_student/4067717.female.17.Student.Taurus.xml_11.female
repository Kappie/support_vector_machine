The mall was OK, except I now HATE American Eagle. As soon as I walked in it was like being drenched in meanness. Dunno how else to explain it. Maurice's was cool, as always, though not so interesting now that we have one in Hutch. Still bought stuff there, though ;)  Then we ate too much at On the Border. So yummy... :-D        I AM 70% EVIL GENIUS!
