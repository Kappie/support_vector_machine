I just hope the 2% salycic acid doesn't burn my face (I heard u can get chemical burns from leaving facial masks on for too long), and between hot water, more hot water and the sun, my skin's about maxed out for burns.   I was looking at my legs last night, and they really look terrible.  There's about a four inch strip of leg (from my butt to the backs of my knees) on the back that's burnt red, and all around it is white.  I even have the cheesy coppertone tan lines.  You know, where that dog is biting the little girl's bathing suit, showing her white butt.  Actually, that creeps me out.  Why do advertising companies think they will sell more sunscreen by showing a little girl's butt?  Is it supposed to attract dirty old men?  Teenagers who go to tanning salons (most of them to AVOID those type tan lines)?  Little girls who want a puppy?   I have to take a shower before church (unless you really want to ponder why I smell like I jumped in a pool of shrimp and tartar sauce.  Ah, that reminds me of Sponge Bob.  Are you ready kids?  Ay ay captain!  I can't hear you!  AY AY CAPTAIN!  Oooo, who lives in a pineapple under the sea?  SPONGE BOB SQUARE PANTS (you definitely want to leave now, cause now I have it in my head.  Later.)
