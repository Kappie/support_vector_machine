This does not prevent me from reading your blog, and due to your unfortunate lack of comment space none of your close friends can make witty comments about you "sexing" crania to the amusement of your devoted readers all around the world.  Not sure how you, as a girl, go about that, and I don't wanna know!  Ha ha.  I'm so mature.  Well, we all have our lapses every now and then... "  Let's all applaud his maturity ;).  And for those of you who may be unclear, when I say I need to age and sex the crania I mean determine the age and sex, ie, juvenile female or whatnot, as I'm looking at the distribution of cranial deformation along both geographic and demographic lines.
