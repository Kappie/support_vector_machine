So remember how I was telling everyone how I live off my GI Bill and disability and go to school full time and live in my parents basement?  I know it sounds really pathetic but its going to get worse soon.  I am going to start working in a video store this summer.  You know Quentin Taratino started working in a video store, of course he was in his teens and I am like 23, but whatever.  I spent four long years in the AF dealing with their bullshit, I need this time to relax and go to school.  Before I left the military I was getting 2.7 average in college.  Now that I am older I will be getting my A.A. with a 3.5.  Yes, Talya kicks ass.  It's just that now I KNOW that I NEVER want to go back into the military unless I have a degree.    Omigod, so I get to teach a lesson plan on Friday.  I am really excited about it.  It will be my first one.  I am going to be doing "Pizza Math" introducing the wonderful world of Fractions to Mrs. Reilly's 4th grade class.  It will be fun.  I will see what I am getting myself into.  Oh yeah this video store hasn't even opened up yet and I got a job there.  I love movies and I need some extra cash since I got accepted into the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program I will be getting less money a month.  I mean some of my friends thinks it sucks that I will get free school and a monthly stipend but I tell them if I lived in Texas, California, or Illinois as long as you do 4 years of the military ANY state school is free.  So I chose going through the Voc Rehab because that way I can save my GI Bill for my master's degree.  See, me thinking long term and all.  I just hope that I am able to finish my B.A. in 2 more years.  I will talk about that another day.
