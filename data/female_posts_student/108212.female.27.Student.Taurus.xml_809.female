Definitely not her cuppatea.  Ching, Blogspot Plus does let you move your old blogs in.  Seems to work pretty well.  Can you change my links on our page?   urlLink BigBellySkinnyMan  is at http://stceciliawashere. blogspot.com/bbsm/ bigbellyskinnym.html now, and I have a new one,  urlLink GraytailAdventures , at http://stceciliawashere.blogspot.com/ graytailadventures/graytail.html .  I bet I hate working more than you do, Brian!  Though I knew guys who would injure themselves on purpose so they could stay home and collect disability.  I don't hate it THAT much.  Yet.
