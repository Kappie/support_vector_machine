I haven't heard from him, and I want to talk to him... I feel terrible, because what if something happened with his parents because of me?!? MAN, this sucks... *hopefullY* he calls soon... Last night, I had a kickass time with Rukhie  Michelle... altho, at times, we had no idea what we were doing.  We saw SHREK 2! =) It was awesome... but those stupid boys behind us... argh,... yeh, anyways.  Then, on the way home, some ugly fat guy mooned us! =| SCARY!  But yep, Rukhie stayed the night, which I missed sooo much!! Cuz yehh... I miss my old friends...  New friends are great... but never forget the old ones... I love you guys!
