I had different answers for the Compre multiple-choice section when I compared my question paper with Karen, Jeremy and Amelia. As for Paper 1, Mdm Liu Jian kind of spotted the question for us already (animals), so many thanks to  lao-shi ! I attempted Question 4 on Whether we thought Singapore was an Ideal Homeland for us. Actually I felt that it was, but I put NO as my answer cos I would've had more to talk about. (Eg. Stress at a young age, etc.) But I think I went a bit out of point. Haa haa ;) Anyways, I would also like to thank my Chinese tuition  lao-shi ! I love you lao-shi! :) Thank you so much for sacrificing your time for us. Lao-shi taught me not to give up and put in my best in whatever I did, and most importantly,  pray . I know the kids and I took up a lot of your precious time (I spent 8 hours at her house yesterday) for the past 2 weeks. You could've made us come once a week only but you ensured that we attended lessons everyday! So KUDOS to  lao-shi ! Most importanly, I would like to thank my family members who have been constantly praying for me. :) Mrs Chua, Fiona, Nanoko, Amily (with all her blesses), Jiax, Karen, YongJie, Kalyn, Hamann, LayChoo, Narin, Brian, Sheena and all the people who wished me luck via. phone, etc. (I'm sorry if I left anyone out!) Let us all just pray for the best, hopefully we get a lenient marker. Haa haa! ;)    Anyways, Jeremy, Simon, Fiona, Geets, Jiax and I went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  which was incredible. A mixture of Sci, Romance, Humour, Family. The type of movie you would never regret watching. Amazing! :) After that I got home and because I was bored and didn't want to touch my books, I went walk-a-jog! ALONE. :( * Sniffle * Haa haa. Because Kalyn dear went on a shopping spree in town. But anyhow I saw Ma'am Vivian! I should jio her to go jogging next time since we live in the same block. Hee hee :)     I'm really glad that it's all over. I hope my hard work pays off. I love you all! * Huggles! *
