There's a long story in which only Jess and Tami know, and that's how it's gonna stay for a while. It's complicated. And for the reason that Jess, Tami and me know, it's hard to let Adam go. I've been trying though. Since September, I haven't allowed myself so even look at another guy in a romantic way, because I figured it would be...wrong or something. I dunno. Something he said. Plus because him and Lenya were alwaaaaays getting in fights, and they would be on and off, I didn't really wat to be tied down..I wanted him. Bad. Whenever I mentioned a guy, he would act jealous and sad,...so I just didn't allow myself to look.  Lately, since the break, I have. There's several guys I wouldn't mind being with right now, and even though some of them are hoooorribly un-practical and un-realistic, I still dream. It feels different, almost exhilerating. It's wonderful. I feel alive again.   And I've come the realization that Lenya is a real person. With feelings. I've always thought of her as an evil, cheating, unloving bitch that was out to hurt Adam and destroy him (and maybe turn him to men instead of me :'( ) But I've read some stuff about her, and I've read some stuff she's posted, and I realize that she's human, like me. She has feelings. And now that I'm realizing that, I think it's time for me to step away and let them be. Not because I want Celine to feel like she's won, caause I have, but...  Adam's been distant. Moody. Different. The last time I talked to him, he made me soo upset because he didn't like my hair ( and was telling me too) and downcast my already really shitty day. Then he started ragging on me for making a comment on his sister, then just left. It was upsetting. And I think we've grown apart, gone distant since that blustery day in October (and I thought then it was cold.) It's hard to get used it.  Second....It snowed :D:D:D:D Holy monkeys, this is the most snow I've ever seen since the Blizzard of good ol 96 :P I went over to Ayla's and we spent the entire afternoon toboganning...I've never done it before today, and hoooooooly I had fun :P Krista and Ayla and even Karen when she was out were laughing at me when I went down. Cause I tend to scream :) And they captured it all on video camera. It was fantastic :) Today was a good day. After that, we had cocoa, and watched CSI and some of Blade. Great day. :) I should have put toboganning as first. It's better.
