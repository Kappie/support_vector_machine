I remember how well I fitted into the crook of his arm, and how giggly we were. And I kissed his cheek. And he kissed mine, and back and forth. And finally, I kissed him on his mouth, with the amount and passion you would have for a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or whatever. And looked at me, with this, air of, shock, surprise, I don't know. And I told him if I was getting out of hand to slap me or something, and then we stood up, and walked out, into this room that was his bedroom. And we made out. For hours. And his "sisters" (he doesn't have any in real life, I think) were walking in and out of the room, and we never stopped. Never.  This is starting to get to be like an obsession. And I have to get it under control, before I freak out. Control. Calm. Easy. Stop. Help.
