(Give me a break, because I folded under the peer pressure) Last night I smoked til I felt nauseous as all hell.  So I won't want to smoke and also my mom isn't driving me to work this week so I won't be tempted to smoke with her.    Also: 40 days til my birthday!  Thats right, only 40 shopping days left to get me one of the great goodies I've listed on my amazon.com wishlist (gwenythlowden@yahoo.com...look me up!).  I figure I've given you party people enough good batch material over the last few weeks taht the least you could do is throw me a frickin bone and make me have some neato stuffs!!  That is all.
