My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down: MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark! LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman! MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . . SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!"  urlLink -Dave Barry   "Do not talk during the movie unless you have something important to say. (Example: 'My water just broke.')"  urlLink -Dave Barry   If the links don't work, that is because you haven't signed up for the pointless member account the crappy Miami Herald makes you sign up for if you want to read any of Dave Barry's columns. If you REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to read the entire column then just sign up, it's not like it costs anything, and if you pay attention, you can uncheck all the boxes that they helpfully check for you that would result in you getting sent a whole bunch of crap you would just delete and then rant to me about because apparently  I  am the stupid one for making you sign up for it when it's really you who wasn't paying attention during the sign up process.
