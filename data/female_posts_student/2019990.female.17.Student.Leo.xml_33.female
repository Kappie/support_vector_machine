It struggles, there is not obvious order to follow, but it's done nonetheless.     So I was "watching" the Two Towers (with the cast commentary, which is quite funny) through a tower of graduation decorations, I began to realize that this is the last spring Wonder Woman and I will be here for, and after this summer we're really not going to see each other much.  It makes me sad.  But then I am going out to visit her in California next spring, when all the music students go on a trip to Florida.     I shoudl really be going though, I have a chemistry test tomorrow, and no idea what I'm doing.  Have a wonderful evening
