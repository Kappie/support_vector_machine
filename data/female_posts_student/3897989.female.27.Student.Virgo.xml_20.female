I did an extra 2 miles on the treadmill tonight aside from my regular 3 every morning, along with my lower body weight training tonight. I followed with some stretches and I was far too tight. I need to find a good pilates program I can do at home or find a good text on stretches. I do feel good though. I feel relaxed and ready for a great night's sleep. Maybe I'll allure an attractive midnight dream. Of course, I think I may be too tired to visit dreamland tonight. I woke up this morning in the same position as I fell asleep in last night.  I've had a busy week though. I deserve to be expended. My first day at the salon was Wed. and from Wed. to Sat. I sold $600 in skin care! I only had 5 clients come in!! The rest of the time I spent letting the girls pamper me. One of the girls waxed my eyebrows and another one of them curled my hair twice this week, next week one of them is giving me and hour and a half long pedicure. We all went out for lunch together this week except Friday. My ex took me out for Chinese to talk about how things are going and we talked about how we are all adjusting now that the kids are back in school. It was funny how we talked about how we weren't compatible and looked on the Chinese zodiac symbols they had in the restaurant and sure enough, we weren't compatible on there either. I'm compatible with a monkey, born in '56. I could have guessed that much. ;) We also talked about his bad luck again. They finally started the interior of the house and when the fellows were painting the walls they spilled a whole bucket of paint on the brand new carpet so now they have to replace the carpet in that room. I wonder sometimes about his magnetism.  I did a lot of free chair massages this week while the girls' clients waited. I have a feeling they are going to keep me busy once I get my license. I talked to one of the girls from a gym in town and their massage therapist quit so she was sending them to the hospital and now all three of them have quit there. One of the good one's here in town got tendinitous and had to have surgery and her doctor told her she can't practice for 3 months at the least! One of her clients is my Mother's best friend. She's been wanting me to practice on her for a while now and since I had my midterms I asked her to be my practice. She came over after work and I did a full hour on her. I was wondering if I would pass her test since she's been to several professional massage therapists, goes on a regular basis until her's had to have surgery, and had that to compare me too. I can't tell you the extent of her satisfaction. She said I was the absolute best out all the one's she has tried thru the years. She tried her best to give me $100. I just invited her to come to Huntsville on my clinic days, if she can get time off work. (She's a mental health therapist.) What warmed my heart is she not only told it to me, she immediately called Mother and told her how proud of me she was and the next morning she bragged on me the whole time on their girl's day out breakfast! My heart is so humbled by her kindness. It really helped getting the deep tissue breakthrough this week. Feeling that I am becoming my destiny makes it so worth what I've gone thru the past few years. I am so grateful.  I also took the kids to the playground where I play raquetball this weekend after work. They have the coolest play equipment there! There's this one piece of equipment that the kids can get on one end and slide down to the other end just like the ropes courses I used to attend summer's as a teenager. It amazing at their strength even though they're so young.  My little girl got to go to a play date Saturday with her best friend while I was at work. Her best friend has my name. The little girl is precious. She's being raised by her grandparents which she calls Mom and Dad. But her real Mother and Father live up North with her two brothers. The parents said they could only afford to raise 2 so they sent the little girl to be raised by her grandparents. Now how much sense does that make? If I can raise 3 kids on my own!! they can raise all 3 kids between both of them!! Maybe she's better off down here with her grandparents. She's a precious child (and she has my name so I have to favor her :D)  I started cleaning out closets and taking all the pictures off the wall. I'm getting ready to start painting. I'm getting excited now. My creativity has been on high frequency the past few days. I have so many ideas. The children are getting excited too. They question me every morning on when we're going to start painting. The boys decided they want a sky mural in their room. They want it with sky and clouds up to the center and blended into the starry night at the top. Now this is coming from a 3 and 5 year old! It's amazing to observe the chakras they are developing now. I'm really going to have to encourage my little girl's spirit. With her being 8 years old now, she has a lot of western beliefs being thrown her way by society now than she has in past years. I'm hoping by giving them the best of both eastern and western philosophies in our home that they will have less energy blockages than I did once I got older. They already know how to meditate, do several yoga poses, the Qigong Wuji short form, they understand the purpose of feng shui, fountains, certain plants, animals, they understand a lot of native American history and drumming. Native American music really seems to inspire my little girl. It' amazing to listen to her sing along in their native tongue. Of couse, this evening, she discovered my Jimmy Buffet song, Volcano. I've put a shortcut on the desktop for her to get to it easily.  A few months ago I was helping my Mother by cleaning her house since she had shoulder surgery; my Father came home for lunch while I was there with my 3 year old. Dad ate his lunch and told my little boy to be real still and quiet for 10 minutes while Pappa went to his meditation place. My little boy gets sweetly close to his face and says, "can I go too Papa?" He realized they weren't "going" anywhere. It was very sweet to have my Father explain to him meditation.  Speaking of meditation, I'm going to retire for the evening and do a little of my own. There's alot more I got to experience this weekend, like making a couple cheesecakes with my little girl, and helping her with her school project of 15 seed variations and 15 seashell variations (of which I can only find 3 different seashells in my house and my friends!!), did lawnwork, and so much more, but I'll save those stories for another time. I really enjoyed staying active this weekend (even though my hamstrings have still given me trouble) and meeting all the wonderful new people that I have and making so many new friends this week. I feel my heart is finally opening and bringing to the world the person who is being held so dear by many. I do miss my love and hope he is well. I send him great stillness tonight as he rests. May his following day go smoothly as the waters of calmness and clarity hand him forth serenity.  With love,  BLG
