Cheese. i actually had fun. the little warning signs on the  "ticket muncher" amuse me. did you know you weren't supposed to put your hair in those things? yea, i got a new wrinkle in my brain tonight. *snicker snicker*.  but, alas, i gave my tickets to my brother, so i didn't get some cheap horrible prize. i'll prolly have to have therapy now b/c i didn't get a crappy prize. *sigh*
