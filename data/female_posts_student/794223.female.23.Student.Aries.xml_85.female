Moving has been...well, interesting to say the least.  We're all trying to make the most out of it.  Here's a couple of classic exchanges between my grandfather and I through the course of the last few weeks, complete with our charming sarcasm which we use to bounce off of eachother.  Honestly, we're so much alike, we probably shouldn't be under one roof.  (After getting his hands very dirty) Me: Hey!  That's soap for my face!  Or was... Opa: You don't have a bar of soap for your knees?  How about one for your elbows, too?  (After asking me to hand him books to put on a shelf in the living room) Me: Could I sit down and eat first?  I just got up... Opa: Eating is superflous. Me: Superflous?  Oh really?  Last time I thought that, I was anorexic.  Maybe I should just go back to that.  Opa: Would you move?!  I want to install my printer!!! Me: Could it wait 30 seconds? I'd like to check the radar to see if we're going to get hit by a tornado. Opa: I don't care! Me: Wow, I sure do.  And by the way, that's my printer, that I found after unloading 7 boxes looking for your power cord.  We're only half serious ;-) While it might sound like we're going to kill eachother, it's usually just because we are two perfectionists trying to operate within the same space.
