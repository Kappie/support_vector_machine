He wouldnt come and see me and he wouldnt talk to me. Why do people like to manipulate me????? I'm a fucking loser. I should be shot because of what I let happen, geez. I just can't even say how disapointed I am in myself. I'd never let something like this happen but I did today. I've just proven to everyone of my friends that have said I've changed that they're right, eh.
