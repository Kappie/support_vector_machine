I can't wait for next next week. Next week I'm working (still) the week after that I get "off". I'll probably be forced to do stuff but I won't have to wake up before seven. I won't even have t wake up before ten, it' is going to be great. I will have two weeks left of sleeping in. For now my  head hurts but I can survive one day until the weekend and one week until I never have to work for free again. I won't have t odo any work expiriance or step into science world ever again.       Well I'm off now time to SIT.
