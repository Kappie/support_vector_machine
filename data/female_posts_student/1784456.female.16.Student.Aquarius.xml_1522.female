I either speak my mind (to the wrong person), hit (the wrong or right person depending if it's a good day) or do something like that. And then I end up with one of my stupid apologies and run away. But it's not because I'm stupid *could be because I'm klutzy* it's more because I'm not afraid of people doing anything about it. Who cares who knows? I'm dangerous when I'm impulsive. It's not because I'm mean, it's just because I can't control what I say sometimes. *Damn impulses* It gets me into loads of trouble. And I've just been blocked! *Yeay! One down, and only a few thousand other people left who know of my existance!* But then... isn't it good to speak your mind? (I tend to do that sometimes) Most of the times it's my friend saying that she really wants to know my opinion about her new top, and me saying that I hate it. Their's a fine line between lying too much and hurting people. Don't you hurt people when you lie? WHO STARTED THIS DAMN THING OFF ANYWAY?!?!?!!!! *i blame cheese, it's always bad to eat it before you go to sleep* And then you end up thinking... maybe you should be left alone in that corner.
