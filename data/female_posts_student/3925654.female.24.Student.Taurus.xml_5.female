Aside from LaTroy's dramatic exit, the rest of the game was a disaster. The Cubs blew a huge lead and are now 10 games out of first place. This is why I'm going to have to stay a Yankees fan for at least a little while longer. We're 7 up on Boston!   Oh, and by the way, I now believe that the contest for most annoying regional accent is a toss up between theBawston accentand the Chic-eeeh-go one. I'd take a good ol' New York accent over either one any day.
