But the docotr was kind enough to explain that there is a slim chance that it may be the early stages of a neurological disorder, such as MS...but that won't be known until they see another later MRI.  So in 6-12 months we will know if it is just the way my brain is supposed to look or something else.  In the mean time they are going to be treating me for migraines.  I have yet to try my meds because frankly I was not feeling well enough yesterday to stay in the line for my prescriptions.  Ed will go get them today, so I am sure everything will be okay.    Thanks for the prayers.
