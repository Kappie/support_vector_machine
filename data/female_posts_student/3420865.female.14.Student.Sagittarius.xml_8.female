[i made that part up. but they really did leave us.] so me and ness went to tim horton's by ourselves... and when we got there, my brother and his friends were there. including the hot one. he was hot. so then my brother drove vanessa home, and [the hot one] came with us. and then i pissed my brother off and he almost made me walk... but hey, it provided some entertainment for vanessa. she laughed for like a minute, but tried not to cuz she wanted [the hot one] to think she was sexy. (i think it worked.) and yes. that was my night... and then my brother and [the hot one] drove me home. it was fun.  k so no plans for tomorrow/tomorrow night. i wanna hang out with "delenda" cuz they're cool cats. but they prolly don't want to/are busy.  and i'm done... cuz vanessa is getting impatient. (she wants to read this. she has no life...don't worry vanessa. i still love you.  k. i'm outtie. paice out home dogs.  you had the best damn sunday dress at the end of the world. kayte.
