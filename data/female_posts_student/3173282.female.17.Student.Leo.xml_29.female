Nothing exciting has been happening at all. I agree with Amanda-i have never hated anything more than this summer. (except a few certain people.) But it's true. The days are nice and sunny, but what to do and who to share them with? Nothing and no one. It's a waste! Summer detention sucked too. 3 hours of reading a book and freezing my ass off in that over-air-conditioned school of theirs. Sometimes i lay outside for 2 hours, but i dont get tan or even burnt. Whaaat! I had a cook out the other day. Usually when u have a cookout it means everyone brings stuff. But everyone just came and ate my food and then left. Except for Rachel and Justin! We watched you got served again and had a happy time. Oh well, i give up with some people. Well i better be getting on with my evening events...later.
