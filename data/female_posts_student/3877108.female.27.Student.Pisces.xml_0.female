Bear in mind that I mentioned our nursing class of 60 meets in an old dormitory building with air conditioning that works sporadically, if at all.  Makes for a miserably long day.    I think I have very poor size perception.  I don't know that I view myself as big as I am, or view others as small as they are, or something to that affect.  Did that make any sense?  All these skinny minnies in class are doing nothing but increasing my self-loathing.  Yes, these are my own issues.  Yes, it's not their fault.  I'll just blame society.  At least I'm putting these nursing school lessons to good use...  using my defense mechanisms already.  Ha!  There's a girl in our class who was nearly Miss Mississippi one year.  Now all she can talk about is her engagement and upcoming marriage.  She's way too bubbly for 8am.    Another girl in class is recovering from major abdominal surgery and sits in those blasted chairs all day.  Bless her bones!  Our instructors were fully espousing the "C=RN" mantra today.  "C is average."  "C gets a bad rap."  "You can be average and also be competent."  I'm not sure I buy into this philosophy just yet, but my standards may have to withhold some lowering as we progress into more difficult classes/projects.  Here's a neat link we read at article from in class today: http://survivenursingschool-snurse-l.org Hope it's still active, check it out.  We didn't actually get to bed bathe each other today.  Instead, we viewed a demonstration of one of our instructors bathing another one.  They also changed the sheets while she was in bed (occupied), brushed her teeth, and gave her a back massage.  The recipient is well liked by most of us so far.  She's a clever, witty little Jewish lady who uses words like "kibbitzing."  (did I spell that correctly?)  That particular prof's lecture today was on stress:  symptoms, illnesses, management, coping techniques, defense mechanisms, anxiety, psychotic tendencies.  When it came to the subject of worry, she included a very short but fascinating blurb on shiva.  If any folks out there care to enlighten me on this subject, I'd be delighted.    Besides the lovely bed bath/etc demo, we viewed some of those PBS-type instructional videos that must have been made in the dark ages.  Very informative though - more of bed baths, changing sheets (more complicated than it sounds!), oral care (both teeth and dentures), back rubs, hair care, and that sort of thing.  One thing I was confused about and never got an answer to.  How do you do an occupied linen change when a client/patient cannot be rolled on their side?  A classmate broached the question to our prof and she said, "Just extra help.  It has to be done."  Not the most effective of an answer...  This same classmate has already begun questioning authority.  He seems to have a tone of superiority in his voice and constantly wonders of the instructors, "wouldn't it be better this way?"  These ladies have more nursing experience combined than he is aged in years, but perhaps he hasn't heard the often rumored cardinal rule of nursing school is to shut up and take what you're given. Grin and bear it, anyone?  In addition, several classmates have mentioned being tired of this hygiene/universal precautions silliness and being ready to move on to loftier topics such as pharmacology (we don't have that until fall).  I actually wonder what expectations some of these people had of the field of nursing before they began class with us last week...  I'm wondering if/when we're going to have a section on body mechanics and how we protect ourselves from those injuries nurses seem so prone to.  Maybe when we get around to the mobility/positioning lectures and labs we'll cover that subject.  I've got to get a lab coat.  Today we received a little bit of information on our upcoming teaching/learning project.  We have to prepare a presentation for a group of 3-12 year olds on a subject like stranger awareness, oral hygiene, healthy snacks, etc.  So tonight our group of 4 decided we'd brainstorm on topics and reconvene to make a decision tomorrow.  We'll be speaking to those kids at a church daycare, so no taboo subjects allowed.  What would you want to speak to a 3 year old about that might be offensive anyway?  We'll also end up presenting our information to our classmates as well.    So far the instructors seem to have assumed we automatically know how to do things like put up bed rails, etc.  I'm looking forward to getting some hands on experience during skills lab the next few days.  I'm ashamedly mechanically incompetent.  :)  Of course, nursing school seems focused on very independent learning, as well it probably should be.  We're expected to seek out a great deal of information on our own.  I think many of the community/junior colleges are doing their students an incredible disservice by some of the "hand holding" that I've seen exhibited in their courses.    Shaving a man, not sure where we'll get to try that.  Wonder if my hubby would let me use him for practice?    We signed up and paid our SNA dues today.  Got our equipment orders - pen lights, clipboards, scissors, hemostats, steths, BP cuffs everywhere.  We won't know our "big nurse-little nurse" assignments until they host a picnic right after fall term begins.  My kids seem to be adapting fairly well to Mom being gone just a little more than usual and having a different pick-up/drop-off person.  My parents spoil them, but not to excess.  I wonder how long a two-year-old can survive a diet of only pancakes?    Tomorrow?  Values clarification and Vital Signs (lecture and lab).  First BIG exam is Friday, fortunate enough to make a 100 on my hygiene quiz today.  Woohoo!  Wish me luck!
