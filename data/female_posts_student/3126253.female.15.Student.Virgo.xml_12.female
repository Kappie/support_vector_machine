Or maybe I'm just ripping off Daina. =D  I've been passing out alot lately and I'm starting to think It's more then just low sugars and such.  If my stupid doctor would stop staring at my boobs for two seconds and actually pay attention maybe he could tell me what's wrong. Ass.  I'm really hot. Stupid boiling weather.  I want my dad's purpley car. It's like from the sixties and such. I want! I want! Gimme! Gimme!  I should go to bed now before I ramble on even further.   Night.    P.S. I forgot to steal Daina's chair again. Crap. Oh well, I will later.
