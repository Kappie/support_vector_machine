I am trying to make it sound as unromantic as possible to help make myself feel better for not being able to see him today.   I am in desperate need of finding a willing and able body to finish the lease out on my apartment. I cannot leave without someone to take my place. I am really getting worried and paranoid about it.  SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!  The lease is up in August, and it would really really suck if I have to take the train to Irvine for 3 months.  SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!   I am a little sad, a little stressed out...  But I could not be more happy to be with someone in my life. Never knew what Love was till he came along. Okay...I'll stop now.
