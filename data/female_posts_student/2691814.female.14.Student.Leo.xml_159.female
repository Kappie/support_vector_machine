I'm wearing my usual green pants..and im wondering(for the ppl who have seen my green pants)...are they jeans? or some type of....contraption...they might be jeans....they dont look like the regular blue jeans i always wear. You'll never find me in shorts thats for sure. Its either jeans or a skirt. ...but are jeans jeans?..or just baggy pants? hmm....francesca..what would you say..you've seen them? They have zippers every which way and pockets on the lower leg. Hmmmm....ok ya this is really stupid. But yes...i am going to the mall...yay for me right?...i dont even know why im going to it...mom wants to go. I really dont want to...i want to read my new books. I have to read them for school...has anyone read the book 'Cut'?...its good, very descriptive. And I also got the book 'You dont know me'..i was going to get like a book on teen witches or some other you know books with some cool stories in them but 'cut' and 'You dont know me' struck me as good. Plus i heard cut was a great book from some friends. So ya....some light reading with heavy subjects to them suits me fine. So yep..going to the mall. Nothing else to say about it...still wondering about my green jeans. sounds like green beans lol. Ok im slap happy as of now.
