He was in congress and is famous for caning a Senator in the chambers. Preston Brooks was mad because the Senator insulted his uncle who was also a Senator. His uncle was from SC. Brooks waited for an apology but when he didn't receive one so he found the Senator in his chambers and caned him. The man never fully recovered. Brooks was dismissed from the Senate, and when he came home to SC he received a hero's welcome. They held parades for him, and some people sent him canes. However the northern states weren't too happy. I just thought it was interesting that I had an ancestor on TV. They interviewed a family member we don't know who still owns the cane. I really want to get in touch with him because I think it'd be interesting.
