So today has been good.  Apart from waking up late again (well 8:50 rather than 8 – needed to leave flat at 9) things have gone well.  I had my Talk Together group this morning, where I help look after 10 little kiddies under 3 yrs old.  The lady who normally does it with me wasn’t there and this other lady had come who was lovely, but had teenage kids and I think had forgotten how to look after 4 babies at once.  She was very impressed with my ability to feed one baby with one hand, rock another baby in their seat with my foot and assist two 3 yr olds and 2 yr old with a jigsaw puzzle.  Talk about multitasking!  So I was feeling really good about the morning, until one of the other mum’s who was looking after the baby I was feeding (as it’s mum was ill) said that I should have given her the milk before the food.  And had I not realised that she still had her coat on? I thought it was her sweater.  Anyway the baby didn’t overheat or starve so I am trying to think positively and not take the remarks too personally.    Then went to church for a monthly world prayer meeting we have.  The other 9 folks there were all retired people, and were amazed to see a ‘young one’ attending – extra holy points for me!  This was closely followed by a very civilised trip to the coffee shop with Debs (with my Tim Horton’s mug in-tow Melanie!)  Then it was a quick dash to the hospital to catch visiting time on the maternity ward.  I got to hold the baby – SHE IS SSOOOOOOOOO GORGEOUS.  I began feeling very broody (Mental note for tomorrow: begin man-hunt).  She is called Rachel Harriet.  The other kids came in and they are all so proud of her. Ruth, who is 2, just stands there pointing at her saying ‘my baby, my baby’.  Paul, who is 4, was hilarious – he had brought her a teddy and was asking her if she wanted to play with it, he asked her quite simply “nod if you want to and shake if you don’t”.    So after eventually tearing myself away, I went round to Debs for tea.  I suddenly remembered that I hadn’t prepared my study for Navs and so hastily did that, at the order of Debs!!  Then we had tea and watched an episode of ER from series 1, during which Debs disappeared into the kitchen as, which I only discovered later on, she was choking!  She is the quietist, most calm choker I have ever seen/heard.  I wish she had told me because then I could have practiced the Heinrich Manoeuvre on her!     Navs was um…challenging.  Lizzy and I were the only ones from our group there and so we joined with 2 girls from another group and one further girl.  Now I HATE change.  And I am finally beginning to build up some sort of trust and confidence in my group (yes it has only taken me like almost a year), so I get totally thrown when with new people.  I get really anxious and jittery.  So we started off with prayers for each other – a section which I don’t particularly like anyway but in our group we don’t do till the end, by which point I’m more relaxed anyway.  So I tried to suppress my jigging and fiddling and everything else.  But it got better when we got onto the actual study. I even raised the controversial question of how much do we think the New Testament fulfils the prophesies of the Old Testament because it was written to do that?  I don’t necessarily believe this, but I was interested to know what people thought, and at least to get them to think about it.  We were looking at Acts 8 where the Egyptian Eunuch believes and is baptised.  It states in Isaiah 56:3-5 that Eunuchs and foreigners will be included in God’s kingdom.  So I was raising the possibility that they included that particular story in Acts 8, not that it didn’t happen, but there were probably hundreds of stories they could have chosen but that one fitted best as it had been predicted in the OT.  We also had an interesting discussion on whether or not we should question God and faith.  I don’t think I need write my opinions on this one. But let me just say that I did reveal to them that I had in the last few years I questioned God and my faith just a little bit, and have even told God that I didn’t believe in him anymore (not sure who I was talking to therefore!) and I have not be struck down by lightening….yet. So it turned out ok in the end, and was probably a good experience for me.  Right folks, well that’s it for now. Must do Survivor predictions, compose a ditty in the shower and begin the man-hunt tomorrow. Will keep you posted on my progress!  love mexxx
