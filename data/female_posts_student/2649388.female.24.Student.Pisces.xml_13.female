Apperantly she needed to get up really early and get to the airport by 5:30 a.m.  She was up by 4:20 a.m., and went into the bathroom.  I, on the other hand, was just wrapping up my work and about to go take a shower before diving into bed ...  I walked out of my room, and realized, she was using the bathroom. WOW.  Living together for almost a year together, this is the first time ever, we had a conflict using bathroom. (She is a morning person; I am a night person.  We use bathroom during different time of the day).  So there you go.  Since I can't shower (and therefore can't go to bed) yet, I am blogging, at 4:30 in the morning.    I never realize, how messed up my sleeping schedule is.  My roommate saw me when she walked out of the bathroom, and said, "What r u doing?? It's summer! You should go to bed early!" -- Sounds like my parents; I know she cares. =)  ... On the bright side, I get to say good-bye to her again before she takes off.
