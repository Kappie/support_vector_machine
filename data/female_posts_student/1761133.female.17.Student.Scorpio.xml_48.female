It's hard to figure out, When you really want to shout, That no one really cares, That no one wants to share. But how can you not be loved, When you know you can't be shoved, Into doing something stupid Or something very putrid. The choice you make is yours, There are many open doors And lights to show the way; So now you know you're ok.  "Second thoughts" By Me
