OH YEAH! i was talking to wendy. and she told me that she saw emmanual at the mall yesterday. and they were talking and found out that they both know me. and he told her that he liked me...but i was young for him. hes 16. and he doesnt live in novato anymore. he likes in marin city. but i guess he visits here sumtimes. bc she said that he came to the shop once but only my mom was there. awww. hopefully ill see him really soon.
