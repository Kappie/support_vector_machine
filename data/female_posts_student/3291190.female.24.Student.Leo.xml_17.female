I can trace the lines that define the world w/ my very own finger. Graciously I delve out advice, causing this feeling of self-importance to linger.  In the blink of my very own omnificent eye I watch the picture change. I am horrified to see my truths  lessons in life rearrange. Quickly I must scramble to recover my dignity  reconstruct the truth. For I am the gatekeeper of knowledge, therefore I must rule the roost. I will provide you with all the opinions you could ever need. Within my constrictive definitions I will limit you to what you will believe. For one moment, if I could see beyond my own concept of self. Maybe I too would know the joy of listening to someone else. But my opinions  ideas are far too important not to relay. I am so engrossed in my own word; I never noticed you walked away. In this moment, picture in hand, I feel certain of why we are here. But wait, I forgot, I am only human  this is all a facade I created out of fear.
