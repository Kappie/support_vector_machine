But I will miss that family tremendously. They added so much to our congregation. I don't see how my dad's gonna handle not having Forest around either.   K. Enough of that. Tears are already welling up. After church I went to Applebee's with the teens. Just sat and talked. I have no money so I couldn't get anything. I didn't really want anything anyway. Quite full. We decided we're gonna see the midnight showing of The Village tomorrow. I honestly feel too old to do it. :-) But it should be fun.   Gonna crash now. Might be going to the beach in the morning with Staci too. We shall see. Goodnight.
