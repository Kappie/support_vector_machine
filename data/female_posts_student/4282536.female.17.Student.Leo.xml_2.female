Well, It's Thursday, and my day at school was pretty descent... i had a chemistry test on all the chem. equipment, and i think i did ok on that! soo i was realllly happy about that.. but then close to the end of that class, we all went to do a lab! and it involved putting chemicals under a blue flame! and genius anna burns herself on the hot metal spoon! and now i have a blister on my finger which hurts really bad :( but oooh well... it'll heal soon! sam's bout to come over for a little while and then we're goin over to my grandmothers house for dinner... and then we're goin to the trinity vs. carver practice game which we're gonna get killed in! at least it will be entertaining! and its definitely a good thing that i dont have much homework tonight! i'm gonna go get ready now! have a wonderful rest of the day!      *Always Remember: be careful with hot things, or you might get burned!
