To be truthful, she isn't all that aesthetically pleasing to me, either.  It's because those demons are too caught up in trading insults to understand the concept of sarcasm.  K, Kuronuway, whatever: You say anything like "the humans should be exterminated" one more time and... and... I'll... use my "blue Force energy" on you, causing you great pain and possibly a bit of a black-out. As Jack said, if we're so pathetic, why don't evil guys with glowing eyes rule the world?
