I used to hate her and never finished her homework. If she's not the one who kept on telling me how bad I was in my Add. Math, I wouldn't improve.Itried and I failed a lot of times.For the SPM, I got 3B for Add.Math, I know, as long as I try, I can achieve what I want. Now, I thank her.        I told her about my current school,complaining about those teachers who are so sarcastic. She said nevermine,I need to work hard by myself in Form 6 and don't expect anything from the teachers.Haha, she knewmyMath. teacher when Imentioned his name, because I was complaining aboutthis boring teacher.        Shewas so friendly, I miss her!         The annual dinner     That dinner was held at my school hall. That's a big newhall, I'm amazed. When I stepped in to that school, everything came back. My memories with my friends and teachers; those delicious food from the canteen... How I wish that I can still be a part of this school.        All the best, NDC!         My current school     It's good to have a blog because you can grumble about anything and rate the world with your eyes. About that sarcastic MUET teacher who think that she is so smart, I hate her. She always talk like as if she is the greatest and smartestteacher on earth. She teachwith a soft voice, and read everything line by line from the textbook. For those who couldn't hear her, they started tomake noise, including me. Then she was unhappy.10 minutes before sheleft the class, she started to complain about us.She talked in the high volume, complain about ourgrammar, our attitude, plus, she reminded us that if we are not happy about her, we can go talk to the headmaster and see who will win.        Hey, you should look at the mirror before you talk, see what reflected in you mirror, is there an angel or a devil. I was totally pissed off with this kind of teacher.Tell me I'm rude, shut up!         People who I like to thank in this week     Haha, that's a new section of my blog. Well, first of all, I would like to thank my God for keeping me alive. Then I want to thank my parents for everything and my grandma too, of course, thank you for your love. Thenmy classmates who being so friendly to me, thank you. Then Mei Shan who gave me a great book since she knew I love reading and buy a lot of books, thank you! Then thanks to Malaysia for the peaceful enviroment and thanks to Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi who amazed me with his interview on BBC.        Thank You!        Peace!
