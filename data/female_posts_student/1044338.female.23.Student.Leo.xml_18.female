BTW, Just to set the record straight, I'll keep a running tally of our Fooseball games.  So far, the record is about 2 wins for Roz and 30 for Dan.  Not trying to brag or anything, but just making sure the people understand the situation at hand.  
Remember to come back often...more to come soon!
+D
