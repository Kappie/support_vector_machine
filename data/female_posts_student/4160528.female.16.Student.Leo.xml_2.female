If A Guy Tells You To Sucks It... Turn Around,Smile And Say... Its Dangerous To Put Small Objects In My Mouth.  you confuse me just about everyday. you were put in my heart and i want you to stay. I know you have a girlfriend but whos that girl on your side. I see you with her all the time. you dont talk to me as much and the phone calls keep getting shorter. you told me you liked me and i beleived you but im not sure anymore. you kissed that girl and made me cry and from my point of veiw you trying to lie. you didnt care at all. you didnt care that i loved you and you were the only one but now im not sure of whats goin on. you dont seem you care or even notice im there. i think of you all the time wondering what your doing and who your with. but it doesnt matter to you. all you know is that you love your girlfriend and that girl on your side. i wish i could go into a corner and hide so im leaving now to find someone new cause i cant bare to even be close to you.....     When i looked over I saw your shame cause the night befor was you to blame. you told me you loved me and i was the only one, but it was just a lie I found there was another someone. With my eyes full of tears and no shoulder to cry on all i can do is cover my ears. you keep sayin that you love me and that it wont happen again. I want to beleive you and put it in the past, and make this love for you last. I sit here and cry and thats all i can do, cause right now i really hate you.  So Im not coming back i cant and i wont.  I want to so bad but my heart is saying dont.  I'll always love You, but the pain you gave me will haunt me too      As i lay in my bed things keep coming to my head. the way we used to be  best friend the way you told me that you would be there till the end. but where are you now, you found someone new and miss you is all i can do. so i sit and weep and the notes i will keep for i love you still and always will. i think back to last year and all i want to hear, is your voice and see your eyes cause all i can remeber are the goodbyes. i still cry like im doing right now and i just want to die. its cutting me like a knif and theres no one here for me and lonely i dont want to be. so im gonna try to sleep now and think of the good times if i know how.      I talk to you all the time, someday i hope your mine. You tell me these thing no one has ever told me before. now your gone and i want to hear more. I hope you get back so i can talk to you again. i didnt even notice how long its been . i havent seen you in a while but i talk to you alot. i hope these conversations never stop. im gonna go rest my head now. and hope to dream....dream of things, how i want them to seem     I love you so much it makes me cry. I dreed the thought of saying goodbye. I dont want you to call or talk to me anymore. All i want to see is you walk out that door. I cant beleive its over or that i fell for your trick but now i realize your just a dick. Why cant i leave, i want to so bad. What happened to the love that we always had. So as i sit and cry, all i want  are my eyes to be dry. I want to be able to think without you coming to my mind, cause to you our love was blind, you couldnt tell how much i really loved you. I didnt want this relationship to end but for some reson you thought the rules could bend, cause you now love those other girls you even bought them necklases of perlse, but i dont care cause its over now. Theres still one question that will be in my head forever.......HOW?     you were alomost my best friend              tell me why it had to end you used to call me everyday and make me feel loved in everyway i understand you found someone new i loved you more and you had no clue why dont you call or talk to me at all you made me cry and told me it was a goodbye so i guess it over we arnt freiends anymore i looked over and saw you with the girl that you adore shes the one you love even tho i was the one that said you were sent from above i hope your happy with that girl while i sit and cry on the floor you dont seem to care while she runs her fingures through your hair i just wish you knew how much i love you     i dont care anymore, im gonna stop trying, cause everynight i find myself crying, its too much for me, why dont you just let me be, i never thought it would turn into something so big, now everytime i think of you i realize your pig, you treated me like shit just like everyone said you would, and now your tellin me to do these thing and i wish i understood, you told me that things will get better if i would just talk to you, but i really dont know what i want to do, then will you just do it again, i am just so sick of men     was there ever a time when you wanted to die cause you found out that life was just a lie Everythings gettin  blury theres nothin left here for me if you only knew what ive been going through i try my hardest to do whats right to find myself crying at night so im going to end it now im taking my last bow please try not to miss me cause ill finally be free     i like you so much i cant take it anymore. it hurts me so much knowing i cant have you. i lay awake at night thinkin what would it be like, if maybe one day it could be you and me. but i know it wont happen even tho i wish it would cause you love someone else and its not me. but if i cant have you then i dont want anyone else, cause your the one that gets me awake in the morning, alive through the day, and happy every hour. What would my life be like if you were part of it?  wish there could be somethin even thought i know there cant. your smile your eyes and the way you just look at me, i sit here writtin this poem about you knowing that i wont have the courage to ever read it to you. you told me you used to like me but you dont anymore. it hurts me so bad to know we will only ever be friends     you told me it would change if i would just say Hi, well i did that but you took it as goodbye, so i guess were through cause im dont tryin, Im sick of comin to school everyday cryin Now its over were not friends anymore All i want to see is you walking out that door you used to help me out when i told you what i was going through even when you knew i was mad at you I want you to know that you were almost my best friend you were different from anyone else so i let the rules bend we used to talk everyday and night but i guess its time for me to turn off the light....       Why is it i sit here and pissed at the shit you do, its not like its anything new. why is it that i try my hardest to do whats right and somehow it always ends up being a fight, i just dont get it why things have to be so hard, these are the times i wish i had a body guard, im goin crazy thinking about what i did wrong, and wonder to myself if i kept it goin, would u know how long.  im done dealin with other peoples problems i have some of my own, my world is like a melting ice cream cone. if u think my life is perfect haha u better rethink that, cause everyay i sit here pullin problems out of a hat. What happen to my best firned the one i thought would always lend a hand. it really does take loosing one friend to find out who ur other ones are, the ones that will be there till the end like a star.      why is it that what i wanted had to end i wanted it to be different with you, i wanted the rules to bend we could have had somethin special, somethin no one else had but thats not how it turned out and now i sit here sad theres so much that i wanted to share when im not with you in seems like i have no air I dont understand why you had to hurt me And why is it that you had to set me free But i guess thats the price i had to pay maybe we can try it again someday But i know i dont really want that Cause i know that im not the only one you look at I had a Strange feeling you would do me wrong And i guess that this is my time to be strong cause im not going back to you i cant and i wont Even my friends are saying dont      I dont know what to do anymore all the bones in my body are getting sore you told me u loved me and that u would never hurt me again but i guess this is now and that was then So i guess its over were not frienda anymore cause all i want to see if u walk out that door You keep making me cry everynight i want to lay down and die i thought we had something special and it could never change But all of the sudden u have been acting real strange so im going to sleep and try not to dream of you cause hurt me is all you seem to want to do....     I did you wrong and i know its true, you trusted me and i trusted you, but i have to tell you now and its ok if you dont want me, but last night when you werent around i was sitting on someone elses knee, I'm so confused right now and i dont know what to do, there is so much more i need to tell you, its not as bad as it sounds but knowing you your take it the wrong way, Last night whern i got home i bent down to pray, i prayed you would forgive me and be with me till the end, you were more then the one i loved you were my friend, so please dont go i want to tell you the rest, but saying it in person would be for the best     I hate you so much it makes me cry I didnt think my mistake would cause a goodbye so i guess its over and we are no longer friends you were my favorite mistake no reson to pretend when you told me you loved me i thought it was true but deep down inside i guess i never really knew you    why do you treat me the way you do? it makes me think that i never really knew you, it used to be that you would never talk to me like that, you must have thoght i was liein when i said i liked you but your the only one i look at, if you didnt want to be my friend why couldnt you just have told me, it would have been so much easier if you would have just let me be........     u shouldnt be mad you shouldnt even care cause i was the one that has always been there. i hate to think we wont be friends to much longer. but everytime i fight with you it just makes me stronger     They all told me it was to good to be true, yes i am talking about me and you, i used to talk to you everyday you made me feel special in everyway you were my best friend please tell me why it had to end now we argue everyday and your tellin me you dont want to stay     i started to trust you because you said i could but you broke my heart like everyone said you would why is it that i cant get you off my mind how could i have sat here and beem so damn blind I shouldnt have gone back to you and everyone knows why now everytime i see you, you walk right on by you act like you dont know me and theres nothing left to say but your the one i think about when i wake up each day
