He struck out 6 of the 10 batters he faced and appeared to have cooled down the Orioles' bats. However, in the 4th inning, David Newhan and Melvin Mora reached base, and Miguel Tejada drove them both in with an RBI triple. The Orioles scored 1 more in the inning to take a 3 run lead, only to have the Red Sox come right back and tie in the bottom half of the inning with a 3 run home run by Gabe Kapler. Then, in the 6th inning, the Orioles took the lead for good. Brian Roberts, Newhan and Mora all singled and were driven in by an RBI single by Tejada and a sacrifice fly by Javy Lopez. Tejada finished with 5 RBI. Newhan continuted his hot hitting with 4 hits, including an inside the park home run. Erik Bedard pitched 6 innings for the win.
