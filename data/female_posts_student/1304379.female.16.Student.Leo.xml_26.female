Whatever it is, I WILL not be glad. Just give me an A2 I BEG. I'm feeling terrible after lao shi went through the answers today. I'm still in a state of shock that i got 2/10 for my Li Jie Wen Da.  Damn.  I know complaining won't help, but it has been on my mind 24/7, no matter how I try to forget. It Just Keeps Coming Back. I can't wait for August. I can't wait to get my results back. Even if it's bad news. At least let me SEE it.  Anyway, MYE results have not been satisfying so far. Owell. I've been quite satisfied with school recently. I kinda enjoy it a lot more. Hmm.
