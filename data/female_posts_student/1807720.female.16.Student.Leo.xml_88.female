And well I did good on my re-write, I got 87 but when it's averaged with my old mark it becomes a 75% which still kind of sucks.  And that Titration test I REALLY did my best and I got a 59%.  I do have one more re-write left but if I did my best to understand and do that test then I don't think re-writing will do any good.  My chem average dropped again.  The more I seem to try, the more I seem to try and understand, the more my chem mark just keeps dropping.  I hope I did good on the Chapter 9 test we did today though.  I thought the M.C. was really easy but I got a little confused on some of the long answer questions, but I just pray that it didn't affect my mark too much.  I can't deal with my average dropping AGAIN because I put in alot of effort.    I totally don't get the new math unit.  Everyone is like "it's so easy."  Why can't things be easy for me??  She even said that is was like the easiest unit they saved for last and like finance is NOT my strongest unit, if anything it is my weakest cause I am not good with money related concepts and stuff.  It is NOT easy, although I do wish it were sometimes.  I can't wait until math is over.  It's stressful.  And well I do like Chem, it's very interesting but I have a VERY hard time understanding.  Tommorow is the last day of school before holidays!!  Only one more sleep.  I need a break.  I am stressed out right now.  Although I do have alot of stuff to catch up on over the holidays and I have all that math to try and figure out and understand.  And well I should start reviewing for finals.  Especially my Chem final.  It is going to be like the most important final I have EVER written.  Depending on what I get on it there are two possibilities:  #1:  I make honors #2:  I don't make honors.  And if anyone knows how much I deserve to be on it that would be me.  Because I know how hard I try to understand and I KNOW all the effort I put in.  I want sooooo bad to be on honors because it makes me feel good.  Afterall who wouldn't feel good because of that?
