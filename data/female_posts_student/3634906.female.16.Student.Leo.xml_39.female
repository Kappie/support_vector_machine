I basically tell her everything, minus boy things and illegal things. But I did tell her about driving James's car. Opps. That was a little illegal but still she thought it was funny. And I also talked to her about Kevin. I kind of feel weird about my brother, he's really started to ignore me and other things. So basicallyI talked to my mom about it and she helped me realize that I cant be mad, my brother is getting older and is about to move away he doesnt want to sit at home with me. And I dont know my mom is so good at cheering me up. She tends to always tell me what I need to hear.   I am really bummed because I wrote on my last page of my journal yesterday. I finally have to get a new one, because lately my journal is my only way out. So today I cleaned it out and got rid of the useless pages that have no importance. And now I am going to get a new one from my room before I go back to my dad's.   Well the canoeing plans are starting to go down the hole. I don't know if Mariah is coming and now Travis probably won't be. He has to work until 1:00pm and he can't get off any sooner. AHH this is going to suck. I just hope we have an even number. Not that I have to worry because I have a for sure partner but still I always feel bad for the person who has to go alone. It's a lot harder that way. So I really hope that no one has to go through that. And I really hope I am not too crabby. Because I really should be sleeping right now and I'm not. Well my dad is coming to get me soon. I have to say goodbye to my mom and get a notebook quick. I'll be back tomorrow night or friday depending.   -gabby
