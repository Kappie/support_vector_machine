I don't care if it's not the cool thing to do.  Tell the people you love, that you love them.  I don't get why we have such a secrecy issue.  But whatever, I guess it's the cool thing to do, to love someone with all you have, but not tell them.  It's too much work to let someone know how you feel.  What I really don't get is when we don't even tell our friends.  Like, yeah, I guess I see why people are "scared" to tell a crush, but if you can't even tell your best friends you love them?  What if something happens to them?  I guess I've been thinking about it a lot latley.  I had a scare a few weeks ago with one of my very best freinds, and I was so glad that I had told her.  I guess you have to think about it as yourself.  If you were going to die, from some random accedent or because someone was pulling a 9/11, would you want to know you had people who loved you.  Who would miss you if you were gone.  So, I don't care.  Stop making excuses.  Just freakin tell them.  **Later Days**
