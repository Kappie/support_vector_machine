I shot Dan's friend Mike a look and said, "Bet I'll know the person."  We crept to the non-smoking side of The Garden, assumed very conspicuous bar-stools overlooking the lower level.  He pointed and said, "Those two over by the window."  But I was already descending the stairs on my way to greet my friends Emily and Lori.  They work at the Women's Center.  They're feminists.  And straight.  Emily reminds me of a blonde Alanis Morissette.  Lori was in my Yoga class; she's in Level 2 now and is training to become an instructor herself.  I met them during the Year of Darkness, Winter/Spring 2002.  Emily was the co-founder of UI's first and only student feminist group.  Interviewed her for the Argonaut when the group put on the Vagina Monologues that February.  It was a hit and so were they.  She was the first to read my famous vagina column; she approved, but my editor made me tone it down.  My sociology professor, Debbie, introduced me to Lori during one of our Directed Study "meetings" at the Prospector aka Alehouse.  That was the day Debbie said we'd be back in this bar after my first semester was over, figuring out what I was  really   going to do with my life because I'd hate law school.       The boys and I found ourselves discussing the waitresses with tight skirts and the social statement that seemed to make.  Dan's a debater.  And he's exhausting.  I pawned him off on the gals and watched the sparks fly.  Lori and Dan had a class together years ago, so she knew how to handle him.  She made great points about power differentials, societal expectations, etc. while he countered with definition-differences and the pressure on men to be tall.    "I was trying to ditch them so we could actually have a nice chat." I whispered to Lori as we hugged when I left.    "No worries," she replied; she's so sweet that way.  "Tell Debbie 'Hi', that I'm thinking of her and she owes me a beer."  Because I'm sweet that way.  So Big Fish was good.  I'll give it a B.  Ewen was his adorable, endearing self.  Bit sugar-coated for Tim Burton, but he pulled it off.  Think I'll have to see it again when I'm not half-asleep.  Seemed a bit long, but I suppose that could have been a stylistic technique.  Saw Pieces of April today.  It gets a big fat A.  We love independent movies shot with handhelds.  It's a very simple story with a very simple ending that made me smile big.  And Katie's actually pretty damn cute in it.  Even if the story had completely sucked, seeing Sean Hayes's (Just Jack) performance with Burnadette made the outing worth it.    Back now in my little den, avoiding the Christmas break-esque weather.  Have a terrible craving for hot buttered rum and a satellite dish.  Just finishing some laundry, getting ready to have a Queer as Folk refresher.  Season Three's due out in a month, after all.    Always feel better/lighter after posting.  The weekends are a bit conducive to creative blockage and these are a great foil.
