Pretty sad but somewhere deep inside is a digital artist waiting to get her hands on some new technology.  Saturday : Went down to see Ross.  He made me French Onion Soup Alton Brown style. It was really sweet of him. He also picked up my full box portable easel. It really is beautiful.  And I almost cried when I saw he wrote a Van Gogh quote on the case. No not because he wrote on it, but it was incredibly sweet and romantic.  Then I made plans to meet up with Crystal and Friends to celebrate her B-Day at The Breakfast Club. I thought I was leaving Ross figuring he couldn't possibly want to do something at 11pm. I was wrong; he wanted to go to Newark to this Portuguese Bakery (Crissy ruined me). He didn't tell me and I found this all out the next day after coming home quiet plastered. It was a cute club, played 80's 90's music and would have been even better if a few people I hate didn't find me there (wtf). Crystal seemed to have fun so it was very cool.  Sunday:  Hangover what? Spent some time with Ross and then went on home to show my Mac to the father rents. And of course Six Feet Under....  This coming weekend is Dad and Diana's wedding. I wish them luck and happiness even though they don't want me to go to Florida with them. (grrr) Back to staring at a blank word doc....  Anyone will do tonight  Close your eyes, just settle, settle  Anyone will do tonight  I got a bad feeling about this (to hell with you and all your friends, it's on).  I'm coming over but it never was enough  I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you Well I got a bad feeling about this  - Taking Back Sunday  I'll hate to think I ever settle on anything or anyone... I deserve happiness like anyone else, and I'm gonna get whats best for me and that's that.
