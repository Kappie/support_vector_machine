They have a certain budget to achieve this and they have to renovate a room per week. They can't live somewhere else during the show and they have to be outside the apartment between 9am and 4pm. At the end of the week, the room that brings the greatest value to the apartment wins some money to invest for the next room. The winner is the couple that brings the greatest value to the whole apartment. What is cool is that you learn some tips for renovqtion and the couples are quite funny except for one, they are real bastards!!  Anyway, you can check out the web site of the show, it's quite cool, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!!  http://theblock.ninemsn.com.au/theblock/default.asp  Enjoy!
