Coz I am still stuck in my stupid job until tomorrow. I just cannot believe it! I am just a part- time girl and I am slogging away like a dog already! I only have 1 DAY of rest for the whole of this week! And... Hiaz... Cannot reveal too much! *Grrrr* The excited feeling is that my workplace is so near to Orchard and you will feel excited too if you are there thinking ''I am so near to be in the camera!'' sort of thing in your head... The anxious part is that they have blocked the road for Chingay to process on. And I do not wish to see myself stuck in a bus with hundreds of other 'sufferers' looking at nothing but each other faces.... But fear not! Coz my father is going to fetch me home, hehe! Like yesterday the roads were already blocked for the Chingay reherdsal and I kinda forced my father to fetch me home too. Ain't I evil? I guessed its because Jacky Chan is present. But my auntie said is because half of the participants are foreigners... Hmmm!
