I just hope everyone knows how sorry i am for everything and for making anyone feel bad. cristyn once told me.. if you can bring one persons day up a notch.. your a good person, well i try to follow all this and i try to do do it to everyone.. but every once in awhile i come across selfishness and idk i just like only think about the good things that i would benifit from.. it sounds stupid.. but i changed and sometimes i just forget how shitty of a person i was and how much i wanted to change.
