She fell down cause people were shoving so she went and beat them up! Yeah! ...I think... ANY WAY! WOWSIES! Ground Hog Day is on channel 5! I've seen it trillions of times and it's sooo good! (I think every one has) Oh well. WATCH IT! Hehe, yeah hyper kiddy mode! Eugh... I was doing Spanish homework and it was a bit hard, but hey not as hard as Je ne comprends pas le français French! (Erm translated: I don't understand French French!) Yeaysie! I mean, if we were actually taught it once in a while then maybe it wouldn't be so bad but EURGH! COME ON TEACH US! I mean HELOO! We sit in class doing nothing... Oh God, I've just realised that I'm doing a Lynne! NOOO! DOn't worry, this somber piano music will get me back to my usual wise depressed self! *sniff sniff* Damn.
