Shaking head to toe while your left hand does "the show me around" Quickens your heartbeat, It beats me straight into the ground You don’t recover from a night like this. A victim, still lying in bed - completely motionless. A hand moves in the dark to a zipper. Hear a boy bracing tightagainst sheets barely whisper, "This is so messed up." Upon arrival the guests had all stared, Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch. Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships. (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.) He keeps his hands low, He doesn't wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe, and his eyes give her the up and the down. His stomach turns, and he thinks of throwing up But the body on the bed beckons forward,  and he starts growing up.  The fever, the focus, The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathe,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  She hits the lights, This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth, He is gasping for air. "This is the first and last time", he says She fakes a smile, and presses her hips into his. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like. He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast, and all he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect. He whispers that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for... (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old.) So much more than he could ever give, A life full of lies and meaningful relationships. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides, He waits for it to end and for the aching in his gut to subside.  The fever, the focus, The reason that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of It used to be the reason that I breathed,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes, the art of growing old.  The fever, the focus, The reason that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of It used to be the reason that I breathed,  but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.   sorry i jsut wanted to share that with you its a good song and it reminds me of stuff but its a good song anyways umm i dunno shits been alright like christmas was good new years was alright and the rest of my vaca has totally been boring ... i dunno me and adam .. are doin good ... i guess ... im not too worried about it tho im eating cold pizza last night i was up till 3 in the morning   my sleeping is getting fucked up again which means when school starts ill be sleeping through all of my class my mom made this pizza its pretty good ... i got american wedding its pretty good ... i liked it its better than the other ones ... i feel so empty lol ... lol its so random but its true ... i no no one is reading this anymore cuz i dont go online alot but ... i really feel empty and its sad ... i dunno o well ... i wish i could be in a good mood ... when ever that is like ... lol probably tomorro lol o well im gonna go try and play some video gameage yea ... so  i guess ill ttyl bye
