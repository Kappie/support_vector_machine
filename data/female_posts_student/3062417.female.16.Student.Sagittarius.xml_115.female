I would burn the food and she wouldn't make anything I like. What am I going to do? Ohhh no! This is not good. Anyone have any suggestions?  Well, today was Monday. I hate Mondays. What else can I say about it? 6 more days of school left. I'm kind of sad and kind of excited at the same time. We get our yearbooks tomorrow. I got a peek at a senior's today and they looked pretty good this year. I'm in a couple (4 or 5 that I know of so far) of the candid photos. I'm starting to not mind having my picture taken for some reason. I still don't like it much but I don't hate it anymore.  So I'm just going to be around here all day. Mom-less and car-less. So if anyone wants to take me out to eat for dinner later that would  be great and I would love you forever. lol  Listening to: [Champagne by Sugarcult]  All I can taste is champagne When it hits the brain like cocaine Spinning around and around I can’t get up without your help I’m falling down  All I can taste is champagne Another day down the drain Sleeping around and around I can’t wake up without your help It’s over now  You want it You need it You can’t explain it You fight it You beat it I can’t live without you I’m moving on without you   Love is like Novocain And it leaves a little stain The beauty in all this pain is I can’t get away from you  So bowl me down and don’t make a sound    You want it You need it You can’t explain it You fight it You beat it I can’t live without you I’m moving on without you   All I can taste is champagne Dancing away down my veins Spinning around and around I can’t get up without your help I’m on the ground   Somebody help me I’m loosing everything when I’m without you Doing it without you   All I can taste is champagne Another day down the drain All I can taste is champagne
