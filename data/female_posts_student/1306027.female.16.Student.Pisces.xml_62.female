This Saturday in fact... stay tuned for the details. I might even add a pic if your lucky. Are you lucky?    Today was a one fortune day.  Yep- chinese again today. Call me crazy, I don't care! I had some really good stuff today though.. general tso's chicken and spring egg rolls. It was supra (yes, "supra") good. I went with my dad and kid brother. I of couse, got to do all the driving. Driving is pretty awesome. When I'm not in an in-car with a big fat "student driver" sticker on the side that is. You know what's weird? Here I am.. almost 16, and I have never been on a highway. I blame my mother. Why? Because I can, that's why. She is supposed to take me driving tonight though, so no worries. You might want to say a little pray for my safety though, lol. Sounds bad I know, but it isn't. I'm not THAT bad of a driver. At least I don't think so.     I leave you with this important information: I have no important information.
