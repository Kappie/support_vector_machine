The Turks so disliked the number 13 that it was practically expunged from their vocabulary (Brewer, 1894). Many cities do not have a 13th Street or a 13th Avenue. Many buildings don't have a 13th floor. If you have 13 letters in your name, you will have the devil's luck (Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Lisa Sheffield, Theodore Bundy,  and Albert De Salvo all have 13 letters in their names). There are 13 witches in a coven.    ~~Thought I'd add a little something for Friday the 13th!~~
