Its Chupa Chups I Love Me in Pop Vinyl.   it smells sooo good. and i got it last summer, but i can't find it anywhere right now, except for on two foreign perfume websites.  urlLink  www.douglas.de   &  urlLink  www.beautyfive.com  .       but anyways, thats enough of my problems....  urlLink  now heres a look of the actual bottle  !   it even looks awesome, huh? lol.
