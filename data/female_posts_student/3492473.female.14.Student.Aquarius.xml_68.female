And the first time, I was with someone who had cooked it before so it wasn't like  I  did all the work. And I know all of you are thinking, "WTF? She's never made Mac  Cheese before?" And yeah, I know, it's freaking retarded but you have to understand, I'm not a cook. I don't know how to do anything fancy. Whatever, make fun of me if you will, but I'm extremely ectastic! On another note, I decided I should get back to reading my horrible books for summer reading for high school Honors English. Don't get me wrong, I love English/Language Arts, but I hate being told what to read! I started reading Lord of The Flies awhile back but I stopped because I couldn't stand it anymore and I wanted to read my Gossip Girl books. (See the post "Read This" if you don't understand) But sadly, I finished the rest of the Gossip Girl novels and now I'm stuck with summer reading bull shit. Before I read like 60 pages into it but I decided to re-read those 60 pages. And it took me awhile to read them so I must be crazy. I guess it's not insanity, it's just I wanna do really well in high school so I can get into college. See, I wanna go to Columbia University in New York. And that's an Ivy League college. I don't know many graduates of WHS who attended an Ivy League, do you? My point exactly. And I  REALLY  wanna get in there. Columbia is like  "the"  college for psychology. And that's what I wanna be. A psychologist and a writer of course. I had always planned on majoring in journalism since that's my main focus but then I realized, who ever said you  need  a major in journalism to write a book? I mean, of course, it'd help, but it's not required. So I might as well perfect something else in case my books suck. But I mean, where's the chance in that? LoL! That's just me being cocky. I'm so  scared  of failing. Failing meaning not getting into Columbia, failing meaning everyone hates my books, failing meaning I would at McDonald's the rest of my life... I have  huge  dreams and I just want them all to come true. Ya know? And god, I'm only 14 and I'm worrying about all of this now. Wait til I'm 17. I'll be a wreck then. Oh geez... New subject. The poem I posted a few days ago. Well, no one commented on it so I'm hoping you all liked it. Well in case ya did, here's another one. And  PLEASE  post a comment so I know if you guys like my writing and for me to continue to post them or just to stop. Thanks!  Fell Out  Falling in love is one thing, falling out is another. I kept slipping under,  as you hit the cold, hard ground. I was in love, and I thought you were too. But somewhere between the parties and the dates, you fell out. You left me here to drown in my own affection, while you could breath easily on your own. I hope you like it alone, because the air in my lungs is finally running out..
