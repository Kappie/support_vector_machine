Whenever I open my mouth to speak, I feel that what I'm saying is totally wrong. The looks on the faces of the students around me, and the expression on the teacher's face makes me feel that I'm babbling pure nonsence. My answers are always completely different than anyone else's. Sometimes I think I only get good marks on my stuff because my teacher jsut doesn't understand what he's reading. I feel like I'm speaking in a foreign tongue, and no one understands me, not even Kimmie and Steve. Even they can't comprehend what I'm trying to say, write or do. Whenever we have the grammer contests, our group always gets points, and always stays on top, but that's only because I come up with the weirdest things that totally throw the teacher off course, and baffle him. He gives us points for effort.  Once, I was stunning. Anything I wrote got full attention and my teacher was appaled at my style. But I've lost that touch somehow, or the teachers have gotten too cynical over time. They see the overachevers, the wanna-bes, and the real achievers, and just figure they are all wanna-bes, all posers, with no real talent. It's truelly sad how one little letter can really decrease your self confidence, and faith in yourself. Ever since I got that letter from the school, I hardly write anything other than in my blog. I used to spout out something each night. I've lost it Laura. I've gotta run, time's running out and I have to zip out a persuasive paragraph about driving that's due in about 10 minutes. See ya in a bit. Love, kellina.
