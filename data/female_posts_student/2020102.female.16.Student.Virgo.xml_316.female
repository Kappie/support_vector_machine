I told my parents about this and how we weren't learning any math yet and my mom was like 'oh you will!' and my dad said 'it'll all tie together in the end.' How does learning about a lady who flew a plane relate to math? 'Oh, what's two plus two? Amelia Earhart.'" -Brandy  "What do we have to do to get free cookies? (later, when the guy asked how he could help us) We're here for free cookies!" -Alex at Subway on Tax Day (aka free cookie day)  "It's for you." -a kid in Newspaper picking up a pretend phone, dialing 666 and then handing it to his friend
