As one can see by the title, I'm going to be extremely flatulant tonight.  If I had it my way, I wouldn't have to see them at all...if all goes according to plan, I won't have to.  My plan: watch Friends until 7:00, take a hour-long bath, and watch Forrest Gump (one of three all-time favorites) at eight. Well I g2g cause I have to go to care group.  New plan: watch Friends until 7, find some way to occupy myself till 8, then watch Forrest Gump.    Your: Happy eyes! Your cheerfull, bright and always want to try something new. Your inquisitive and quite lovable. You have many friends and will succseed in life.    urlLink   What type of eyes do you have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
