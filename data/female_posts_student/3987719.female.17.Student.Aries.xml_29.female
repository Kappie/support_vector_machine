After six innings of work for Dodgers starting pitcher Jeff Weaver, he leaves the game with a chance at acquiring his tenth loss. Weaver's teammates believed otherwise, and would change the outcome in their next at-bats.  The seventh-inning rally begins with a Grabowski double, followed by Dave Roberts getting hit by a pitch. After an error by Houston, All-Star Paul LoDuca comes out with a timely single to knock in the two on base. With LoDuca on, the surprise of the season, Adrian Beltre, comes up big with his 25th homerun to leftfield to take the come-from-behind lead of 5-4 off of the Astros' embarrassedreliever David Weathers. His blown save was the cause, and the boos from the Houston crowd were evidentlythe dramatic effect.  You'd think the rally would stop there, but Shawn Green walks on six pitches after Milton Bradley reaches first base on a surprise bunt single. Alex Cora then feeds off of his teammates and drops in a single to load the bases before Olmedo Saenz ends the inning on a pop-up to Jeff Bagwell.  In relief of Guillermo Mota, the dominating presence of Dodgers closer Eric Gagne madeits way to the mound in the 8th inning after the Blue offense brings home two more, followed by another Astro run, earned by Mota.  Three of the four outs made by Gagne were recorded as strike outs, and he takes with him his 27th save of the season.     Dodgers (54-38) remain in first place of the National League West, two and a half games ahead of the Giants (53-42).
