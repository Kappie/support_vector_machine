((If my parents chose to be wed at a later date Maybe their marriage could have survived And if you think deeply into that concept There is a chance I wouldnt be alive.))  Sometimes I wonder what life would be like In a whole other situation, time, and place Would everything I know at this age Become just a picture in a picture frame?
