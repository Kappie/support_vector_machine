It took us about 3 1/2 hours to make them, but it could've only taken a little over an hour if we didn't mess around. It was fun though, I haven't been with a group of friends outside of school for awhile, so it was a good way to end a good weekend. However, we got into the conversation of college and I think one of my friends got offended with what we were saying about not being set on one thing in particular in case you change your mind. She interpreted it as if we were saying she wasn't going to make it into fashion design and ended up leaving saying she was disappointed that I (not anyone else) didn't think she could make it. Hmmmm....Save the Drama for your Mama! But, the subject of college. I got a call the other day from a student rep. from U of Iowa and we talked for about 15 minutes. I got ask a lot of questions and he seemed really cool about everything.  Prom is this weekend. This week is super deluxe busy for me too. It's going to be awesome though. WOO HOO!!!! I'm so excited.
