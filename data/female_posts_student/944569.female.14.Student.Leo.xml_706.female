If you don't have the nerves to do that, give me a call and i'll take care of her for you. I cant stop watching a film directed by tom hanks with him in the movie called,"That Thing you do". I thinks its amazing. It probably won't interest you very much but i luv it. " Table 19, your pizza's ready!" hahahahahaha! IM hyper. camp so close i can feel it. Good bye youngins! hahahahahaha
