Anyway, yeh, I was thinking about the Kyndall thing today, and she is pretty much the main reason that I am still at FRA.  If she and I were to, as you so elequently said it, Lindsey, "break up," I would have nothing left there, and would most likely go to BHS.  Just thought that you would like to know that, even though Kyndall and I are cool now.  Well, except for the fact that she couldn't go to the coffeehouse, and so I didn't go because I didn't want to be totally alone there.   Oh well.  I'm exausted anyway.  Just a quick question though...do old people roll their trousers up?  I need an answer, and then I'll explain. Also, I was designing a website for Habitat for Humanity of Williamson County.  I've finshed it now, and would appreciate it if you guys could check it out on your computers.  Please give me ANY feed back, no matter how harsh.  www.hfhwc.org   Thanks!   Two more days to see Fiddler.  Tell me if you want to go...in case its incentive, the most Christian guy I have ever met plays the Rabbi in it and he does a very cool dance.
