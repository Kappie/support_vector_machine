So I talk all this bullshit about letting go, of people, friends etc. when its time to let go. but not really, the truth is that I am attached to certain people  I get sad when I realize that they have to leave. Instead of appreciating the times  the moments that we had.  I think I am going to go on a run. I feel sick to my stomach. Its like when you know that shit is over. You want to do anything to avoid looking it right in the eyes. Try to distract yourself, attend to the things around you. Just so you don't have to be consumed by that sickness.  Its so funny b/c I smile  stand there, like this shit isn't happening. Just waiting for this moment to pass. So I can go hide, my heart  my emotions. Wait until its all gone.
