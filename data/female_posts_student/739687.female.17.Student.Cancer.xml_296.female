I think sometimes that random day where you just want to sit around and do nothing is kinda nice. I haven't had a day like this in quite a long time. It's like I always have to be on my feet; doing something, hanging out with someone...just always on the go. Today was nice just being lazy.  I think I washed my face about 50000000000000000000000000 times today.  I think I'll wash it about 5 more times before bed.  I'm glad I'll be busy again tomorrow. And I'm sure I'll find something to do Sunday. I can definately make some schweeet arrangements on Monday, and Tuesday is going to  freaking kick ass.  If I still haven't told you, in my failed "efforts" to keep it on the down-low, well...you'll see.  Well, I should probably go to sleep soon, since I have to wake up for kickboxing in the morning. Hooray.  Keep it on the down-low, crazies.
