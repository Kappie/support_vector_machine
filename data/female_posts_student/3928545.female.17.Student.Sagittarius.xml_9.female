Three bands...the first, One For The Books, they were the "amateurs," they were HOT and basically all my age. The second, In The Know, they were old, fat, and awesome, the keyboard man was Asian and had a shirt on that said !YO *HEART* CUBA! it was awesome.And the main event, Streetlight Manifesto, 7 guys, the oldest probably 45. The way they dance, it's freaking cool as hell. I wanted to so badly but I had flip-flops on, plus, I was with Josh. If I'm gonna do something like that I need my boos (not booze (sp?)). I don't know what it is about that music that gets to me...maybe it's the trumpets and trombones and the sax. It's so original. I'm dumb because I keep talking about it. I'm going to go there atleast a couple more times this summer. Enough about that. I'm really sad for someone. This person doesn't deserve to be treated the way they are. To be kept up until 4 am upset because everything istheir fault?? No...I'm sorry, this person doesn't deserve that. You have to deal with your own things, the other person's reaction is their own, it's their right to act the way they do. Do what you're going to do, be independent and think for yourself. Do what YOU need/want to do. Don't let others controls you. Anyways, it's a beautiful day and I want to go for a walk.
