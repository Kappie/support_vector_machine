It's just really freaky. Anywho, I just had some popcorn and so I'm kinda full. For some reason, we have popcorn like every night. I got on  urlLink Hogwarts Castle  (we'll just call it HC) and had a nice chat at the Ravenclaw Table (even though I'm a Slytherin, lol.) For some reason, Slytherin Table is always deserted. Well, it's not always deserted: it's not as bad as the Hufflepuff Table where no one has posted in like the last few  days . So my mom took me back to the pool at like 6:00 but they were having a swim meet and I got really mad. Grrrr! Well, that's all I have to say. ttyl! Byezo!
