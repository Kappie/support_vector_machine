(no offence guys... i loved it, really. i just wasn't feeling great/was tired/kind of...upset.) yeah that was tuesday...  then today was boring/hot too! frik i need to sleep more at night... yeah nothing really happened today, except i had 2 freezies. yeah, that's how boring it was.  aaah best song ever= demolitian lovers  by my chemical romance. here are the lyrics... because i love them.    Hand in mine, into your icy blues  And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway  With this trunk of ammunition too  I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets   I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know just how much you mean to me  And after all the the things we put each other through and   I would drive on to the end with you  A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full  And I feel like there's nothing left to do  But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running   But this time, I mean it  I'll let you know just how much you mean to me  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of everything  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow  And we go cold   Until the end, until this blood  Until this, I mean this, I mean this  Until the end of...   I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow  And we go cold   But this time, we'll show them  We'll show them all how much we mean  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of every...   All we are, all we are  Is bullets I mean this   As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms  Forever, forever  Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning  Forever, and ever  Know how much I want to show you you're the only one  Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun   And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood  And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down  And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down  I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood  I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever    well i have to go now... cuz my brother needs the computer. paice.  kayte.
