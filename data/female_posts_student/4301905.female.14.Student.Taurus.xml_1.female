It's weird and extremely frusterating. I guess I'll write about school.  First off, I dont' want to go. Everyone says that it's the worst time of your life. I don't want to spend 9 months being judged academically and socially. I hate school. I hate popular people. The only comfort I have about them is that they'll fuck up school and spend their life on welfare ,and as Deron (CKY) said, "at a bar trying to connect with their party past." I hope they all have promiscuous sex with eachother and get numerous STD's and get pregnant. I hate how they make everyone feel like crap just to make themselves feel better. I'm sick of them and I'm sick of school and I'm sick of teachers who are condescending and treat their students like crap. I'm sick of all of this stuff and school hasn't even started yet. That's about it. On a better note just some websites I thought I'd pimp:   urlLink www.ckymusic.com   urlLink www.killsometime.com   urlLink www.ebaumsworld.com   urlLink www.tarantino.info/   urlLink www.maddox.xmission.com   urlLink www.rottentomatoes.com   urlLink www.goodcharlottesucks.com   urlLink www.adiofootwear.com   urlLink www.zumiez.com   urlLink http://manicdigest.blogspot.com/   urlLink
