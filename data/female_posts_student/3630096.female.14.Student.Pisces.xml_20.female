I can't stand silence, or long term communication. I don't know why... It started off with the same sequence again, early in the morning, half awake, half asleep. When I reached school, fanqin straight away criticise my bag. Hey, wad's wrong!? Say I copy huiqian's bag...walao. Cannot have the same colour mehz? I'm a blue freak, hey, you know that? I must agree with everyone that all of them WOULD NOT take a thought about buying your style of bag. It would make them all out of place. So first lesson, english, go com lab2, type feature article...quite ok...typed quite fast...one of the fews who completed the assignment earlier than the rest!=). Then history...haven't get back common test results...haiz. Then reading, recess, mt....forgot how to write the 'huan' character in the phrase 'huan fa', lively(?) and to think  I study until so hard sia!! Then maths...moral education...I beginning to have a impression that miss yani do not like me at all...However hard I try to explain to her, she just won't help me! She.......she's so...........just help, just trying to clear up the things, YET! SHE REFUSED! Trying to maintain her smile, I nearly broke into tears... This is so...so...so unreasonable..............................I simply don't know what to do.......isn't there a single person who can help me? Despite the unhappy event, I laughed when the three of them fought against kheng boon [the daffie duck!]. They ran out of the classroom, all over the place, trying to escape from his clutches, ending up in the washroom! Ke lian, ke lian... Then hand in dnt wb, I tried to catch up with the three of them but they ran off too fast. So I remained in the classroom, watching some of them doing the forgotten hw, then I realised I missed a page! So quickly copy =P, then run down with yuhui to submit the books... Then accompany her to the general office to hand in $$ for the australian maths competition. A very long time. Then we rushed upstairs to the kitchen and then see jaslyn and szehui so go to kitchen again...peek in but see no one but the sec1s...quite disappointing...thn miss yani come to rush us into the next kitchen. But I thought,  this  is the kitchen?? hmmm... Then we measure the flour and butter, collect the chocolate chips and almonds, eggs with the sugar! Then we started to play around...lol. But the mixture was done, we shaped it into round little balls then press it down with a fork to create a certain pattern on the cookies. We waited for 20min, and we helped ying ge and qiyng. Also, we toured around to take a look at other people's work...haha. Harold's work is a disaster....hahahaha. They say is nice but I personally think it's not. it had too much chocolate! It's too sweet!! But we enjoyed that. We ate jiawen's and it's quite nice and tasted lots of ours, which is superb! So I sweep the floor and they litter and sweep and sweep and sweep! Tiring sia... Then give up, dun wan ter sweep le! Then slacked off, run away! hahahaha. at first wanna go to band room but then band room not opened. Fed up, go here and there then go room. Silence~-......................They whispered between themselves and I can't be bothered with that. Met him at the bus stop, yucks...he cut his hair until...so....so....er xin. yucks. sat there...thinking..............................thn jaslyn's mum come and she go home and huiqian go home............. Walking on the pavement...................I just can't help thinking more and more and more..............why oh why....why am I the one? They don't understand, the seriousness of the trouble I am in, it is like being arrested without even commiting a crime or anything and you must pay the consequences............Sigh. All I hope is that this will clear up soon..................
