We were working at this park, and we were planting all sorts of trees. It was a lot of fun, I can not believe I get paid to do something I love so much. I also started a garden at home, I know it is late in the year, but, I think of it as starting early for next year. I also heard about the situation with Ian and Sarah. Ian told me all about it today, since we did not talk last night. We usually will talk on the phone every night for an hour, Ian was at the movies with his friend Georgia, while I was at a plant warehouse until midnight trying to get the right kind of tree for the park. So we didn't have a chance to talk at all. I think it's cute that Ian talks to me every day, even though I am way out in Ohio. I really appreciate it, and I love every minute he talks to me.
