Sit around watching every programme shown on tv when i know i should be catching up on homework, assignments and such...well, i will..i made a promise to myself and im gonna keep it..lol...but its just so much fun hanging around, no worries bout exams and deadlines, and just such...relaxation..i know after this holiday im gonna be all stressed up till my hair all turn grey so i might as well enjoy my freedom while i can..and oh yeah, after this, god knows when im bloggering again  im so totally confused now, i have no idea what 2 study next year, where to go etc.  if there's totally no barrier (no financial problems, distance bla bla) then i would luv to go to the U S of A. but *sigh* .. that's near impossible right now. so, everyone's kinda looking down under. well, i can accept that..Oz isn't too bad..so many ppl are there, my bro and his pals ( who are kinda my pals too ) , Haley, and hopefully Eelynn decides to go there..haha , i still remember we were making all these big plans bout going 2 America and living together and when our parents came to visit we could just sorta chuck em 2gether..*sigh*  doubt i'll want 2 go next year though, probably stay a year here, can save some $$  (what am i talking about? i can save  loads  of cash! ) .. oh and also, im gonna miss lotz of cool peeps here! my fam , friends and a special somebody *ahem*  somehow i dun wanna go where my bro is, i mean, it'll be nice if he's so close by but then, its like, "DUde, where's my freedom?" , u know what i mean..  i was just thinking bout last year, and i was so hoping i could go to Hawaii or California .. and then i find out JPL is from Rexburg, Idaho...and it's like OH-KAY..haha
