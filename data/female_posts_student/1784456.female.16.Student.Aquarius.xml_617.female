And Nargiza is really cool so we should get her a pressie next saturday when we're in Bristol. I'm filling out this report thingie about her and it's really hard! It's kinda based on preaching, and er, she kind of taught us Russian! Oh well, I hope i didn't mess it up toooo much. Note to self - Don't wear Brasil shirt tomorrow. Ok!
