My parents are gone on a one-day cruise with a Radio DJ and other winners.  This is the 2nd time my Daddy one something.  He won beachboy tickets, but we were gone when it was.  TT_TT  So sad.  =D  I'm making an ID Card for here, and I'll post it as soon as I'm done... if the oekaki stinks, I'll draw it out then scan it, which would probably be worse.  o_O;;  Oh well.  XD  Meh loves to draw.  La la la... when I go church camping, I get to bring a friend, yay!  Kayla gets to bring two because my mom said so, but I only wanted one.  =D  You'd think a tent that fits max of 3 would fit five girls?  We're getting a new tent!  Yaaay!  X3   When we go camping-camping, its gunna be storage, but for now Kayla gets the bigger one, because she has 2 friends coming.  Hannah and I are gunna have so much fun, because Kayla and I already have a big tent!  Lotsa room!   Kayla and I have been switching from new tent to new tent because well, we've grown a lot, and tents have broken.  o_O;;  Good news is:  I won't have my little friend this time for church camping!   I get to ride horses, shoot arrows, go river tubing... its so much fun!   Last time, it was SOOOO cold at night!  My sister and I woke up before five am because it was so cold, and we're able to work everything, but everything we needed for hot-chocolate was in the truck, which was locked.   X(  My parents had the key, and we couldn't wake them up.  So we went back into our tent, frozen stiff, and pushed our cots together, when in a sleeping bag, and cuddled up as close to the other as possible.  Both of us couldn't sleep, so we read and listened to our music.  It was fine during the day, but SO COLD!  O_O;; brrr... I hope its better this year.  Heey... *jumps to previous topic*  my id is turning out pretty good!  Yays!  Well, I'm gunna end this weird-o post.  o-O;;    Oh, and I'm still in the thinking stage about streaking my hair... O_O;;
