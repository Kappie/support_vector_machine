Let Neptune work its magic on you, and you'll have reason to believe that things happen for a reason. Sometimes the sweetest things take a little time to ripen.  So my horoscope says that i'll get a second chance with a friend (ummmm, sam!!!!) and finally have a date to prom because it is on June 12!!! I have the perfect dress with matching shoes, purses, necklace, and earings.
