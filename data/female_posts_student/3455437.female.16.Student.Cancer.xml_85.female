I kicked her water bottle in the creek and i cldnt get it back.. now i feel bad and i want a drink. dammit! 6 more school days till germany!! yeww cant wait just so i  dont have to do the whole school thing. The belgium exchange student is sitting next to me and shes tryin to show megan some pictures and  Meg's always putting on some fake laugh.. its really annoying. Megs like "what site is this" the other chick " its my and my friends website"  meg " what you can get a website" in a totally surprised voice but its just a blog thingo , cept its skyblog or sumthing. I was gonna tell Meg its called a blog but then she might think im listenin to their convo... thats how i got the idea to  write in this... shes writes in this weird belgiumy writin ....  i was tryin to read it before when she was writing an email but i cldnt read it.. anyway that is all really not  important.           shegs   is still bludging school, Danyel is on a drama camp, joelle is sitting 3 computers away from me, Simono is sitting 2 comps away from me and Krisitin is sitting 1 comp away from me (next to me) We have some sub teacher who like knows me ... eek anways i really really need a drink. OMG fuck i hate PCs .... stupidest things ive eva seen! grr they pissing me off.       oh wells better b off.... gonna ring benj to see if she has my bag.    laerz
