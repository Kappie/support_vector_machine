If we can get approved for a loan (the major obstacle for us...) we will go ahead with our idea most likely. We will save $100's of dollars a year in gas....the Jeep ate $25 of gas in two weeks going about a mile or so a day. What crap!!!! SOOOOOOO since gas prices are not likely to ever get back to the .95 cents a gallon they were when I graduated from high school....we are looking at our options.   The Massachusettes Supreme Court made a mini step in Gay Marriage Rights today. YAY! I have a certain kind of UU faith that the home state and base for Unitarian Universalism will be the first state to have truly legally recognized gay marriage. There was a woman last named Rios who was quoted as saying "Gay Marriage will be bad for families." Whose family? Hers? As if over population wasnt an issue, as if all these Christians just skipped the part in the bible that says only god will judge...as if any of these people have every met a gay family!!!! GAH. I get so frustrated sometimes.  Henry went to the Vet today. He did great as always. He loves car trips, but I decided it was time that our cat started to wear a collar. He disagreed immensly at first. But he seems pretty used to the contraption by now. We didnt get a safety catch collar as Henry is a notorious escape artist with those quick-release collars. It has a normal buckle and in every way appears to be an ordinary collar. However, there is one link that has elastic in it that stretches so as to help the cat out of a choke situation. Of course, before he got used to the collar he tried to choke himself by gagging. Silly kitty. I just realized he is looking over my shoulder as I type..ummmm not so silly kitty?  I think my inlaws are going to get their digital camera too finally. It has been months in the doing that this digital camera is coming their way. I did a bunch of research and we headed to Circuit City to look at the model...of course we weren't going to buy it there...I found it for less at Amazon.com...but we could see the camera in person at our local Circuit City :) My mother in law quit smoking...and it seems that in her moods and whatnot my father in law will go to any ends to appease her so as to help her not smoke. Its working out well for her so far :)  Oh and yeah WVU Financial Aid office STILL cant get my financial aid right. If I didnt babysit my account and their office I would totally be screwed beyond belief on a regular basis. They applied their full bill to my first summer session of classes but couldnt be bothered to apply my full aid to the first summer session as well!!!! HOW MUCH MORE WORK IS THAT REALLY!?!?! They make sure they get their money, but leave me high and dry!!! The Ohio University FA office was NEVER this bad. I will call back on Monday....I called today and it was supposed to be taken care of today...BUT NOOOOOO I checked this evening and NO CHANGE. GRRRRRRR. I keep envisioning writing a very harsh letter to someone with power....to not let WVU disperse financial aid period unless they get their act together. I know, this could shoot me in the foot...but they wouldnt risk losing their students for lack of FA offered...they would get their office together!!!! *Wonders who to write about this issue other than her two blog readers*  Well for now that is all the news in fits of print. --Mack
