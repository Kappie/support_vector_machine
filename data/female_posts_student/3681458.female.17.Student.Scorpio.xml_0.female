He ignores all my calls and acts mad at me, even though he is the one who waited until today to tell me.  I don't know how I expected him to tell me.  Whatever hope we had of getting back together has now gone up in smoke.  At least I feel that way.  He even mentions that we should go back to the way we were when he knows what's coming.  Right now, even though I am in love, I hate him.  I want to sneak out tonight.  My sister's window has no screen.  I can leave and come back in the morning.  I could act like I am just tired from my stay at a friend's house this week.  I want to spend every second with him until he leaves.  I know this isn't possible though.  My parents are psychotic.
