Sooo...in an effort to talk about something actually interesting, we went to the horse races tonight! Quite a show, we only stayed for half but still saw four races. Very, very interesting. The jockeys were akin to small chairs with two legs, supremely teeny. Jayne would make a good jockey, except I think she is over the height limit, being 5'0". I think the height limit is around 4'8"?   The carnival was also going on around the fairgrounds (might pop over tomorrow to eat fattening goods and obsess about how stupid the rides are). I SAW KRISTINA! Ohhh, that made my week. She hasn't written me yet, said she can't find my address, it being trapped behind some picture frame she can't remember (forgot to tell her it might be behind the picture of her catdog she brought to camp). Oh, she is so sweet. I missed her tremendously. She is very bright for her age, no wonder I took to her the most at camp. She was my favorite :D I wonder if she has seen Jenny around. I couldn't stick around to chat as the old family was waiting to pile into the car and go home, but it was so nice to see her. Bwah.  Latest school assignment is regarding China in antiquity and medieval Japan. It spoke a lot of Samurai and how they came about, I thought that was very interesting. Did you know that homosexuality among the Samurai was very common? Intriguing. Very loyal men, were those Samurai.
