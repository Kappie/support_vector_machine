THE TURKEY DRAGON IS HERE!  ágætis byrjun   bjartar vonir rætast er við göngum bæinn brosum og hlæjum glaðir vinátta og þreyta mætast höldum upp á daginn og fögnum tveggja ára bið fjarlægur draumur fæðist borðum og drekkum saddir og borgum fyrir okkur með því sem við eigum í dag setjumst niður spenntir hlustum á sjálfa okkur slá í takt við tónlistina það virðist enginn hlusta þetta er allt öðruvísi við lifðum í öðrum heimi þar sem vorum aldrei ósýnileg nokkrum dögum síðar við tölum saman á ný en hljóðið var ekki gott við vorum sammála um það sammála um flesta hluti við munum gera betur næst þetta er ágætis byrjun  -Sigur Ros  that song makes me want to just... be content. not just content is some regard, but so completely happy i could just die and flaot away and never have to worry.  testing was today. not much to say there except that it was insultingly easy.  mom was taking diet pills today. she wants to be skinny for her trip to L.A., so we have to put up with her crazyness that comes with not eating and taking what is, in essence, speed. when she takes diet pills, she has a different smell. when i got in the car, i smelled it and immediately knew. it's kind of weird, i guess.   i seem to have a certain smell ID for everyone... like mammaw smells like cigarettes, micheal((mom's genius friend)) smells like leather, mom smells like her soap and well--- mom, and the kids across the street smell like baby shampoo and macaroni. i can seriously think of a smell to match everyone, even people i haven't met. nikki, i would guess paper and fancy hair gel, etch... smoke and dust, and lemme think who else, oh ya, heather would smell like pine shavings and pop-tarts and snow.  does snow have a smell? i think it does.   myself, i seem to smell the most like clean hair and dirty clothes. not really really dirty clothes, just ones that have been sitting on the floor for a while. i suppose if you sniff really close, i smell like cinnnamon toast, because of that soap i use and the fact that i kind of smell like toast also.   today in biology, which was at a weird time because of testing, we watched a movie about birds. the first bird was called Archeopteryx, and it was kinda scary looking. upon seeing said archeopteryx, Emine made a pointedly accurate observation, saying this thing looked like a "Turkey-Dragon". it was hilarious, and made even more so by the fact that the "thing" did look much like a cross between a turkey and a dragon.  today in guitar i learned lots of sutff. mr. beach gave me the tabs to "Maleguena" ((if you don't know it, it's the only peice of spanish guitar you ever hear in movie))((it's like den-den-den-den-den-de-do, den-den-den-de-doh-de-DUN)) but anyways, i picked it up pretty easily and i'm going to practice on it this week.   alrighty i think dbeedbeedbee that's all folks! i hope you enjoyed that detailed look into my smell system, and a couple ONOMATOPOEIAS((yeap, i speeled it right))  oh and i'm not doing a spellcheck on this post because of those lyrics, so don't think me a fool.
