I ended up gettin my dress, but i don't have shoes, and since i now think i'm annoying to hang around i don't think i want to ask someone to go with me...because no one will wanna. so yeah, um anyways. I'm going to prom. :) but i'm not near as excited as i think i should be.  So i figured out today that Emily doesn't plan on going, and well I also think i'm going to be practically forced into do an after prom thing, that hell, my boyfriend prolly won't even wanna come to. Hell I DON'T EVEN WANNA GO TO ONE IF I HAVE ONE> so i prolly won't have one. Sorry guys. I just don't wanna. I wanna be able to stay out, and not have the fear of being totally embarrassed by my mom (she's cool and all, but sometimes...) I don't wanna really get sloshed or anything, but i mean going to a party where everyone else is that i can laugh at would be really fun. BELIEVE ME. i won't get sloshed, or hammered (no connection with my nickname there btw), or wasted...or tipsy *i think that's the new phrase* or anything else like that.   Okay so my cat is freaking me out right now...(random fact)  anyways. so this is my first post in a while that hasn't sounded depressed, but in reality i sort of am. I mean i'm on Spring break and either EVERYONE is gone, or EVERYONE isn't calling me...prolly the latter. I've done some stuff with Cassi, but i'm pretty sure even she's gettin tired of me. :( sadness.   it also had to freaking get really cold for spring break...which ROYALLY sucks.   "oh My goodness" -tori
