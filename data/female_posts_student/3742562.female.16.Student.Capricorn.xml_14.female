What's wrong with them people?! It was so  awesome ! I loved it! I could have stayed there longer...but we only stayed for 2 hours cause my Lauren was hungry and kept complaining the whole time...but damn, them people are talented...they had freakin Picaso in there! How awesome is that?!      Then we went shopping, after getting lost again for a bit...haha...I got's me a sweater, wallet, make-up bag, belt, and earrings. They're so cute. OMG! And they have this perfume called Brit, and ahhh! It smells so GOOD! I'm saving my money and getting it! I HAVE TO! It's just SO good! hahaha...
