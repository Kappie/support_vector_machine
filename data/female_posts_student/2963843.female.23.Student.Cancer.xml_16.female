My best friend Mel tells me that its absolutely fine to go.. But seems like my body can't take it.. was rolling on the bed all day after going.. Am never gonna do that anymore!! We went to this JAcuzzi where only Mega gym members were allowed in It was really relaxing in the hot jacuzzi.. then i went into the cold one... ohh... felt so good but now have to suffer the consequences man  My stomach still hurts alot and my back is aching really bad... Yikes tomorrow still gotta do project after my investment class. Gotta go.. see u my blog
