It was an eye opening experience.  i know it doesnt seem that way but let me continue.  We sat down to eat our cookies and drink our dr peppers.  well it was after school so all the gothic kids from AHS came in and we just sat there watching them.  i went to school with these people so it wasnt any surprise when they had blue hair or the baggy jeans.  Well i just sat there sipping my d.p.  while my grandmother talked about how life was when she was a kid.  Then i remembered all the times my mom has mentioned how life was different for her.  So here is a message to all parents/grandparents...okay we get it your life was different guess what? the world changes and how you raise your kids has to change with it. what was acceptable then isnt now and visa versa.  you have to just realize we dont live in that world you all did.  Just because we wear different clothes, listen to different music, doesnt mean we are doing drugs or having sex.  you all are way too paranoid.  relax breath count to ten.  things change it sucks sometimes and sometimes its good.  we have to learn to deal with it. I am sorry.  I hope this helps you.
