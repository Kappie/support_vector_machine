The pain  That came With the decision I made But you layed Your love down, aid I cant, run away It would be... All loss, no gain  Why forget My sins, regret I remember All my debt Cant let go Wont forget The mistakes I met My life, I saw But still, I backslid...  Backslide...Collide...Abide...Backslide..Collide...Abide...
