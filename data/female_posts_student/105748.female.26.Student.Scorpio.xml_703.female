Brian had to order another harddrive from DELL.. In the meantime, I've decided to buy my own computer.  It's neato!!  It's 2.53 Ghz Pentium IV with a DVD/CD player on the first bay  DVD/CD burner on the second bay.  I decided to forgo the internal zip drive because Brian's computer has one and I really wouldn't need it except to access some of the old stuff that I have saved which is no biggie because our computers are networked together!  It's awesome!  I think I'll be online more from now on.  Look for me on AIM, YM  ICQ!  And, of course, here!  By the way, just got done watching Sweet Home Alabama.. It's soo good!
