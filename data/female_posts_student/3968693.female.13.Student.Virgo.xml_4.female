I mean she is just so unpredictable!Sometimes she is very nice and understanding then sometimes she acts like a bitch!I dont understand any of the teachers, i mean they are all pretty nice but sometimes they can turn out to be really freaky!!!Example:Ms.Zaki,Ms Elizabeth,Ms.Rekha  Ms.Michelle!I think they suffer from serious mental illness!Anyway, Shivali cant stop staring at me during lessons  and acts like a complete idiot! I mean everybody knows she is pathetic but does she always have to prove us so? Another reason why i cant stand Shivali, She goes around complaining about every tinywiny thing we say to all the teachers !!!!I mean doesnt she have a brain or what? But unfortunately most of the teachers believe her stupid senseless complaints and we always get into trouble unnecessariliy!Now you understand why i hate shivali  have grudges against most of the teachers in my school!They are all so bloody damn sickening!!You cant even talk in peace! Goodness sake!And shivali's parents also complaint about me ipsita,raina,janhvi,meghnapriyanka from 9 standard!!
