Here's one just for you and libraries:   Living in a library   Yes, I live in a library. I am full of information. You can find something about Africa or Anatartica in my pages.  Yes, I live in a library. Can you guess what I am? I can tell you about the telephone invention or the Democrat convention.  Yes, I live in a library. Do you need a little hint? I have more than one volume filled with science, people, and places. What am I?  I am an Encyclopedia! Yes, I live in a library. I inform people  who look at my pages. I tell them many stories. So, please come in and say "hello."  by Rose Hill 6-7-04  What do you think?  Please post a reply! Thanks. Rose :)
