Again, my mood was affected by the incident where I mention before. I was very happy when he told me that he did not cheat during the exam and he didn’t plan to do so in the exam that will be held next week.  However, after some talks, things seem changing. I forgot how the incident happened until it became worse. I was really couldn’t hold back my temper. I was frustrated. Perhaps he’s right. We cannot want every people to think the same way as I am. For the case, I don’t think it’s wrong to make people to think in this way –  i.	Cheat in the exam is wrong.  ii.	Rules are definitely not set for people to break it.  iii.	Discussion does improve people, but not discuss during the exam iv.	Exam is designed to test the people how much has he/she learnt in certain period.  v.	Monthly test is also an Exam. We should treat it with right manner.  It’s all about self-disciplined. Those who don’t have any self-disciplined would want to break the rules. It depends on one’s self-principals too.   What really suck my head was he asked me not to care and he thinks that it’s not wrong to do so during the exam. Maybe you will ask me why I still care about him even though he asked me not to do so. The reason only one, cause he’s my god-brother and my friend too. I can ignore his actions if he’s nobody, but not when he’s someone who plays important part in my life. I sent him e-mail. I really need sometime to think whether I should continue our relationship. I think it’s not worthy to put on so much of care on him but it is not appreciated. Now, I’m not sure whether I’m right to take such action.   My teacher told me before, we can’t make any decision for others, and we can only remind them. If they refuse to accept the advice, we can’t do anything, just let it be.   Perhaps, what another friend told me last night was right. He said: “control on what we can, don’t worry on what we can’t. I think I’ve been worry too much. My worries do not mean anything to him. And I have been worried too much and it’s over the limit. Frankly, I’m those kind of person who could not leave my friends alone in troubles. I would like to help them; I would like them to get away from troubles.   For this case, I know clearly what would happen if he really cheat during the exam. People in his class, especially the girls who come from my school, who want justice will look down on him. Perhaps they will make some reports too. I don’t want to see him got into all this kind of situation. I don’t want other people to look down on my friends. I really don’t want.   Now, what should I do? Should I just leave him alone with his own decision? I feel helpless and confuse. Please tell me what should I do if you do have any ideas. I will appreciate it. Sorry if you do not understand what I’m writing. I just can’t make it clearer.
