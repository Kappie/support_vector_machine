The vegetarian place wasn't open though so we walked down to the Lighthouse Cafe only to find that it was out of business so we went to this one restaurant called Cheese and Company which I had always seen but didn't know anything about. I was amazed! I had no idea there was a place like that around here. I always thought it was this little shop that sold cheese and sausages and stuff on a glass counter and there were a few tables and chairs for people sampling or something because all I see through the windows were like two tables in front. I thought it was a tiny little place but it's huge! It's like the biggest store on Main Street. And it was so adorable. It reminded me of a place you'd see art students, doning french barets and sipping tea.  Luckily, true to my stereotype they had vegetarian options. It was a super long hot walk to the movie but it was good.   Being in the sun and heat for a while always makes me so tired but I want to stay up and see Modest Mouse on Jimmy Kimmel live which comes on at 12:35 so I have a while. I'm killing time.   Natalie told me about this new newspaper that I might be able to get a job for! That is so cool! She's so awesome! We're going to go meet the lady tomorrow around noon. I hope that goes well. I really do.   So this was the last day of school, I can't believe it. It doesn't feel like it. Graduation feels too close.   Oh yeah, I know I'm jumping around alot but my sister was at Wal Mart today and she said she saw a mime! That is so awesome! I am  so  jealous.     Music: Sink to the Beat - Cursive
