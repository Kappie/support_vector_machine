Mahinda, and Aden head of to Boys/Girls state, we're off to the Ukraine, my grandma and aunt from ND are heading home.  Crazyness.  And Mahinda I feel your pain about the duffle bag, I'm leaving a bunch of my stuff here, because people over there really only have three pairs of clothes, so you won't fit in well if you wear too many clothes.  But all the supplies we have to bring over there.  Wow!  We have four big suitcase full, and then there's some stuff in my suitcase with my clothes, because I had extra room, and stuff we really can't afford to loose is going in carry on bags. Tonight we had a really fancy dinner with my aunts ex-husband, his parents, and his sister's family, for Lenni's graduation.  I got to wear my homecoming dress again, and that was exciting, because I love that drss.  And I got to wear my new pair of "expensive" shoes.  Holy cow was that a pricy reastaurant.  My meal was $30 with out a tip.  My aunt and her ex-husband split it, but I feel really bad, and I really want to pay them back for it, because both my aunt and my grandma have been buying me alot of stuff while I've been here, and I have money specifically for these things, but they won't let me use it.  The dinner was nice though, and wasn't as tense as I thought it would be.  Everyone was civil at least.  It looked like it was really hard on my aunt though.  We got in the car afterwards, and she started crying.  I still don't quite understand why.   Oh man, it's getting late, and I need to get some sleep.  If I can't blog again until I get back, I'll be keeping a journal, and I'll have a gigantic post then.  I'll miss you all.  I love you.
