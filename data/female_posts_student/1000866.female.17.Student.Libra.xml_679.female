With one click of a button...I could write my inner most thoughts in here without anyone knowing and with things being exceedingly confusing lately...it would be nice. I'm too lazy to bother to write in another one of these things and make that private so...I don't know. I guess I'll think about it more. But...I suppose I have this to say. It's been on my mind lately.   How is someone supposed to trust someone when they aren't being trusted by that very person? Trust begets trust. And how is one supposed to be friends with someone they don't trust? Without trust, friendship can't exist.   And, that's all I have. Good bye.
