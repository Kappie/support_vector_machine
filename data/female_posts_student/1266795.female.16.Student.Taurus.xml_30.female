Hopefully enough people actually remembered (haha) that they could make it memorable for you! And hey, who said I would have pried you about the letter from your dad? (OK, I probably would have, but hey, give me credit. I know *SOME* things have to stay personal.) Hope you have a great day!  Choir banquet tonight -- should be exciting! I always love being with choir people, and who doesn't like catered dinners and awards ceremonies? (Well, granted, not all awards ceremonies are great, but choir ones are better than most.)  Since I just posted, nothing else to say. TTYL!
