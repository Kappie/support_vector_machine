I think I'm coming down with a cold. OK, my sister is singing karaoke, and it's starting to get to me. She's probably the only person I know who's worse at singing than me. Besides my mom. lol. I can't wait until our SMV (science music video for those of you who don't know). So much fun. I want to see Michael and Austin's. I really want to see how they're going to get Austin wrapped up in tinfoil. I also want to enjoy laughing at a certain someone's playing of the drums. (TM lol)   Libra :  Today you're the glue holding everyone together. It might not be easy and it might not be fun, but if you relax and let yourself go into it deeply, you'll end up having a good time.   Haha. So untrue. These things are usually true for me but not that one. Right now I'm more like, being held together than holding people together.   August 26, 2003  A Berkeley High School teacher arrested in a prostitution sting says that her sex life should have nothing to do with her teaching career.  Lol. Oh well, reminds me of coach huff. I'll ttyl! Luv, Philly
