Lizzie called around one from where ever she's at in the US to say happy birthday so that was sweet.  Jessica called later and saved me from my boredom.  She treated me to a movie.  We went to see Saved!, it was really good.  The cast was amazing.  However, I do have a soft spot for independent indie flicks.  I came home and sat around for a few hours.     You'll never guess what the school is doing to me.  I received a letter today saying they are withholding my report card until I hand in my Algebra II book that Mr. Healy assigned me.  First off, I've never had Mr. Healy and next I can bring them to the exact cabinet I put my book in.  So now I have to make an unnecessary trip to the school tomorrow and raise some hell for a dumb algebra book.    My family and I went to Manervas for dinner tonight.  I'd never been there before so my dad thought it would be a nice place to take me.  It looks like a place a mob would have their secret meetings.  I found my future husband there.  He's a bus boy.  He's so cute.  He asked if I wanted more water, which clearly translates into, "I love you!" He kept looking at me and I don't know whether it was a, "she's kinda cute," look or a "rich bitch," look because it was kinda dark in there, give me a break.  But my family is far from rolling in the money, we are your average middle class family.  My dad just thought it would be nice to take me to a place I'd never been.  Man, that bus boy was HOT!  Ladies, I'm very confident in saying you'd all agree with me.    ~Kay  countdown until I'm 18...364 more days
