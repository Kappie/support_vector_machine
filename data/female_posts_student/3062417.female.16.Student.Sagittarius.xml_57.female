Study hall I always have good conversations with Molly. Band was fun. We had Chad as a substitute and he taught us how to say I love my monkey in German. It's Ich liebe meinen affen or something like that? And in Spanish it's juego con mi mono. I like monkeys. In 6th period study hall we were just quoting the Blue Collar Comedy Tour the whole time so that was fun. Then after school Carol came over and we just hung out and talked about everything that's been going on lately. She just left about 1/2 an hour ago.  Now I'm just talking to Gavin and listening to Allister.  Song: Walk home drowning these memories in the rain  Biting my lip to transfer this pain   You're gone and I'm still going through withdrawl Next time around  I'll build a stronger wall   You broke my guard with guiltless eyes Divide me like a virus from inside And came back just to salt the wounds Now thanks to you...  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes   You needed more attention than I gave Instead of talking you just played games  And smiled as my whole world became unstitched I wish I'd known you could be such a heartless bitch   You broke my guard with guiltless eyes Divide me like a virus from inside And came back just to salt the wounds Now thanks to you...  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes  I start runnin now I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes -Flypaper- Allister  And I would like to add that Gavin is the "sexiest bitch ever". lol
