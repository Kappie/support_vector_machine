Anyway, I started working on my spanish and I had it almost done but my computer shut down so it lost all the work I did and I got real upset and I had to start over....bummer.....Now, I'm studying for a science and social studies test tomorrow...I have a feeling there both going to be really really easy!! I guess thats all for today...
