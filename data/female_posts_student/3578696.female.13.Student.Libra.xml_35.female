I gave up finding a job last week, I mean hinde ko naman kailangan magtrabaho but I guess gusto ko lang maging active during this summer. Also I'm going on vacation sa Canada in a little while so I don't want to waste my time looking for a job if I'm not going to keep it, also I don't want to have a bad record 'cos I'm a newbie.  Right now I love listening to tamia's "officially missing you"...seriously it makes me cry everytime i listen to it..hinde ko alam kung bakit basta lang it does..well sayonara for now!
