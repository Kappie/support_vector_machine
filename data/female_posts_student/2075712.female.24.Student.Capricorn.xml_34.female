I was really scared.  It was just a short viewing for the family so she wasn't going to have any makeup on...which scared me.  She had already been dead for about 5 days..I was scared that she would look fake.  I was really amazed at my grandmother's look though.  She didn't look dead at all...she looked like she was sleeping.  She didn't look pale.  I'm glad I decided to go.  I got to say goodbye to her.  Ok, I know this sounds crazy but maybe I was just in some sort of denial while I was there.  I could swear that her stomach was going up and down at an even pace as if she were breathing.  I pointed this out to my family and they could see it too.  My cousin said it was because she still had air inside her body.  I know that's true but it was tripping me out cuz it was so steady and even.  Then I was touching her beautful hair (she always had better hair than any of her children, or grandchildren) and all of a sudden she lets out a burst of air through her mouth.  I stepped back and sat down cuz I felt like I was going crazy, I was starting to convince myself that she might be alive and just sleeping.  To this point I had not felt her actual skin.  I guess I had to though.  So, I didn't continue thinking "maybe she's still alive"....so finally I touched her forehead and felt chills throughout my whole body.  She was ice cold and very hard.  My grandpa didn't have the energy and he couldn't handle seeing her again...like that.  He didn't go to see her.  I understand, he cried the whole time and said that's not the way he wanted to see her...he kept saying "I just want her alive".  My poor grandpa...he's such a sweet guy and he loved my grandma soooo much.  I can't stand to see him alone.  It breaks my heart and I cannot even imagine the pain that he feels.  Like I told him..I'm very sad and will miss her greatly but I know that know one feels it as badly as he does...our family decided that we've got to keep my grandpa busy.  We don't want to lose him too.  I'm really proud of him though...he is so strong.  I always used to tell my grandma and grandpa that I wanted to marry a guy who loved me as much as my grandpa loved my grandma.  One good thing came out of this sad time.  My cousin who I grew up with, we'll call her J.  J and I were inseperable growing up.  At some point we kind of lost contact with each other and grew in different directions.  Well..I always thought she didn't care much for our family.  I mean...I know our family is not the  best  family but nontheless they are still are family.  Well..I was wrong.  During this whole time, she has been there for my grandpa and mom just as much as anyone else has.  I got to spend alot of time with her and realized that I really miss having her as part of my life.  I hope that we keep in touch more now.  Not only that but she's moving in a week or two and we will live only several blocks away.
