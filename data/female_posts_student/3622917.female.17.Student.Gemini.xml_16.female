Not for lack of trying but the whole mono thing kinda puts a damper on not sleeping. But as I sit here (alone as usual) I am laughing away because I am sitting at home updating my blog while all of my friends and other people in my age bracket are off at school. Learning things that they will never again use. Of course they also get to talk to people other than their dog and their computer. It's a sad little existence but it a good one. At least for now it seems that way. I am not thinking about the guy... All right I am but I am trying really hard. It's just that certain little things remind me of him sometimes. Not in a ooh-I-miss-him kinda way. More of a wow-I-was-incredibly-stupid-for-going-out-with-him sorta way.  Now playing: Buried Myself Alive by the Used I am very into music. Almost all types. Not country though. AltCountry I can take but actual country... There is just something so sappy and cheesy about it. Now I know people who are going to be very angry that I said that so apologies in advance. This is just one girl's opinion. Let it go! I don't know I just like a little variety. I like it when I am writing because different songs can stimulate different thought processes. I am really fascinated by people's reactions to music. A really well constructed sad song can move someone to tears. Or even a happy song that has some connections.  Now Playing: Kiss by Prince Actually, I have a variety of songs that rather than make me sad, make me really quite angry. I guess it's the connection thing. But no more of these songs. Which is sad because I have ruined a fair number of mix CD's for myself by putting these on there a long time ago and now I can't listen to these tracks. Breaks up the flow. These songs are: I Believe in a Thing Called Love by the Darkness, This Love by Maroon 5 and Laid by James. Now in principle they are all very good songs. Especially the last one , which was sent to me by someone who was very important to me at the time. My how things have changed. I try not to associate certain times with music now because it can ruin a perfectly good song. Now Playing: Where do you go by No Mercy Yeah so I am a child of the eighties. Actually I am child of the nineties but because my parents were nineteen and twenty when they had me in '87 they were the children of the eighties. So I got exposed to all their lovely music. I absolutely despised it during my I-am-so-much-cooler-than-everyone-I-know phase in Grades four through to about grade eight. I was quite the little snob. So once again apologies to all the people I was really horrible to because well, I was stupid. I really do love this song.  Now playing: Angel by Sarah Slean desperation and the end of the world. Two themes that scare the shit out of me. Especially the latter. I think that it is possible that I am a deeply disturbed person. Who spends time thinking about the end of the world? I guess its down to me and Morrissey. Will the world end in the day? At night? Well, that's about enough of that. As I am home alone and there is no one to console me if I have a breakdown. Also there is no one home to make me melty grilled cheese. Or run to the store when I run out of chocolate popsicles. Or sit and watch Law and Order with me and try to predict the ending. Sadly, being able to predict Law and Order endings is about the only upside to being a police officer for my dad. Downsides in this case include: post traumatic stress disorder, always distancing yourself from people you care about as well as addictions. Yeah so that is why I am all alone because my dad has had to go off to rehab yet again. So that is a downer. I miss him but there is nothing I can do. He can't even call for the first few days. And he left on Saturday. So maybe in a couple days.  Now playing: Femme Fatale by Emilie Simon My friend Sandy just stopped by for her tupperware. I got cake in it a long time ago. From the cake auction at school. I do kinda miss school. But mostly just the people from school. I haven't even talked to my best friends in days. Which is sooo abnormal for us. Before I got sick it used to be that a day never passed without me talking to at least one of them. Now I haven't seen Kirsti since my birthday and Rach since two or three days after that. And neither of them are ever online anymore. But I am a strong person and will survive despite little or no human contact. Or at least I think I will. Now playing: Change Clothes by DJ Danger Mouse (Jay Z) Well, I am tired and I think I should start in on some lunch. Thank god that my wonderful (*ahem*) sibling and his little friend came by yesterday and I bribed them into going to the store and getting me some Kraft Dinner. My all time favourite food well that is next to melty grilled cheese. But that is not going to be around for the next eighteen days or so. I need a massage. My back is sooo sore. I think it is from falling asleep on the couch so much. I should stop doing that. Not very likely. Now playing: Blackout by Muse I will say my goodbyes from high atop this tightrope. As the gentle breeze makes me fear not only for my life but for my fleeting sanity. It is a delicate balance. One that makes me incredibly nervous. But then again, these days what doesn't? There are stories waiting to be written. All I have to do is find them. I know that they exist out there somewhere. Maybe one day I will put some of them in here. I think my blog could use a little artistic merit. But there is no guarantee that this can be achieved through putting my mundane little creations here. They deserve to be out and in the open. But if they weren't tamed by me then who? It is better this way.
