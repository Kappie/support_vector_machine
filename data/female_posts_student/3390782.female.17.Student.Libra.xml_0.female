Then what are you to do? I have a demon...many demons. I am not proud of most of them, but one of them was a beautiful disaster. Everyone has been in a really screwed up situation once in their life. I have been in many, but the one involving he who is called Chester is the one I don't regret... my beautiful disaster...my immortal. All things have a consequence and I have a consequence to my beautiful disaster; I love him. More than I wish to admit. I used to love him before, but then he drained my heart and made a spade. However, I now can feel for him again and I don't know why. How can someone who once poisoned my blood now cause it to flow so freely? I feel my life and my death inside him. I hope that death comes first as life would not have meaning if I can't have him.
