Although we stayed in a "nice" area and were safe, the people we passed through the many towns left an impression of sedated life.  The children were usually happy, but they know not what lies in store for them as adults.  It's something to make you stop and think...do we really NEED to make donations to churches and fundraisers for all those people who live oh-so-far away?  YES.  And we need to pray for them.  And we need to do what we can when the opportunity arises.  It doesn't mean sit on your butt until someone comes and asks for your help...it's going out there and being proactive...helping others.  Of course, there are literally thousands of homeless, abused, sick, and neglected children, adults, and animals here too...so where to start?  Ask God.  Let Him lead you where He wants you...you will know.  I miss you terribly and hope that God blesses your time there.  Oh, and we will HAVE to go try that Mango daquiri, ok?  I'm waiting on you, chickie!  :)  Jill "Madd Bess, B.I." Buie
