Which of the following negative characteristics can you tolerate from your mate? Bossiness, jealousy, selfishness.   Self indulgence, stubborn, materialistic.   Gossipy, irritable and impatient.   Possessive, moody, selfishness.   Arrogance, sulkiness and smugness.   Scathingly critical, cranky and irritable.   Overbearing, sulky, manipulative.   Self-destructive, ruthless, overbearing.   Argumentative, impatient, critical.   Egotistical, anxious, unforgiving.   Tactless, rude, self-interested.   Self-pitying, temperamental, dependent.    had a problem with this question because I can't deal with any of these characteristics. Especially the ones that have to do with being a) self-obsessed (that includes self-pity), manipulative b) mopey, sulky, and self-destructive (though that last one could also go under "a") or c) overbearing, critical, arrogant... and that would leave me with....gossipy, irritable, and impatient. Wow... um... I don't think so. If I HAD to choose I think I'd say...well no, that was useless. The only one I could accept would be elitist, because well from this last entry alone I think we can conclude that our personalities would then match.
