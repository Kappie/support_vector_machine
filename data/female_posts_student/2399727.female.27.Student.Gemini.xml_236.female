Went to a closing out sale for perennials at a temporary garden centre with my mom and got 12 plants for $12.   Toronto's mental today.  Yonge Street is closed north of Wellesley for some type of street event and Toronto Island is hosting Caribana.  The trip back wasn't too bad except for a jackknifed truck on the QEW near the 403 turn off.  That, of course, backed up traffic in both directions because of rubber-neckers.  Idiots.  It would be great if this country could make up its mind about what to call today.  Almost all of the country has a holiday today (except Quebec, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador.)  In BC, it is called "BC Day".  In most of Ontario, today is the "Civic Holiday".  In Toronto, it is "Simcoe Day".  God help us.  I haven't done much today.   Haven't started to study for my final yet but if that doesn't happen today, it will certainly happen tomorrow.  I did get my course codes ready for entry into the computer tomorrow morning at 6am when my registration times open up.   My friend Joey died 11 years ago today.  That's very hard to believe.  PP is still behaving himself; having some back trouble so when he's in pain, he is usually pretty morally centred.  I was thinking of going over to Rosary group tonight but I'm not sure that it is happening nor am I sure I feel up to it.  I might as well just wait until September to rejoin them.  More to come...
