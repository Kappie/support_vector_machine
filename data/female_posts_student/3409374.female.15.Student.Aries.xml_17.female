My parents took this opportunity to play with their new digital camera...haha. Anyway, shortly after we reached the top, we went down another path to some radio station. There, we were not allowed to take photos [dunno why] but we took anyway...cos the scenery there was fabulous, like New Zealand. Haha. Then we went down stretches of road down to the main road. Quite exhausting lar, since the path down to the radio station was so  xiong , and that the weather was getting hotter by the second. Then we took a Malaysian public bus to where our car was! Cool right? Haha...my first time taking a public bus in Malaysia. No air con, but lotsa wind. They dun haf EZ-link cards, but u juz pay the driver direct...can get change even...haha. Bus stops the moment u flag it...no need to be at a bus stop sometimes. Haha. We then took a taxi from the bus interchange. When we reached our car, we thanked God that it was not stolen [as the taxi driver told us horrfying stories earlier on] then we went to cool ourselves down with watermelon and my parents ate lotsa durian...actually, uncle R ate lotsa durian. He kept digging into the shells for more. Yew. YuX. After that, it was free-and-easy. Went shopping and then went to eat a late lunch...the famous Yong Tau Foo at Taman Sentosa, Johor. So shiok!! Haha. Drank all of the soup until my bowl was sparkling-only-with-oil clean. *YumYum* Causeway was jammed as usual...took us 1 1/2 hours to get the singapore. But it was worth it i guess. A day of exercise is always good...plus we took home tonnes of pics. Heehee.
