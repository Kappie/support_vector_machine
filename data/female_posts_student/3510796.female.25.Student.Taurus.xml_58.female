I just got back from seeing this film, and I wanted to post my thoughts on it as soon as possible.  Plus, Grey told me I had to.  She's so cute when she's demanding.  FIrst off, I'm not going to review the movie.  Hundreds upon thousands have already done that, and a lot of them have actually gotten paid to do so.  I'm just putting down my thoughts and impressions of the film, and writing about a few moments that don't seem to have received as much media coverage.  After the intro and the opening credits roll (and don't get me started on the 17 minutes of commercials/previews), 60-90 of the most emotionally jarring seconds I've ever experienced in a movie take place.  The screen stays pitch black the whole time, and all you do is hear.  The theater fills with the sound of the first plane crashing.  Screams, crashes, panic.  Then the second plane, the sound as immense as the first.  There's no need for images here; I can see it all in my mind, as clearly as the day it happened.  At one point, I hear a loud crash that sounds like metal sheeting hitting the ground.  Having watched the 9/11 documentary a couple years back, though, I know what the sound really is.  It's the sound of a human body hitting pavement after a 1,000-foot freefall.  Did you know that President Bush wanted to cut the base salary of soldiers?  True story.  He also wanted to cut pensions and health benefits for veterans.  Jack up the cost on their prescriptions, too.  Mind you, at the same time, he was lobbying Congress for an $87 billion increase in military spending.  Where, exactly was that money going, then, if our soldiers were now being expected to sacrifice more than their lives for our country?  Yes, Michael Moore has an agenda in this film.  He wants nothing more than to get George W. Bush out of office.  But it's not like this is a hidden agenda, is it?  He seems pretty damn open about it.  He's made this film to make his point.  And yes, he does sometimes manipulate the images to get his point across - the scene of Baghdad children playing in a schoolyard allegedly on the eve of war is a low moment in this otherwise solid film - but that's what a filmmaker is supposed to do, and Moore is incredibly adept at doing it here.  Ever since I saw the eyes of this administration wandering away from al-Qaeda and toward Iraq, I've been steadfast in my belief that these people have to go.  I didn't vote for Bush in 2000, my first presidential election, but I didn't vote for Gore either.  I couldn't stand either one, so I voted with my conscience and punched Libertarian.  I haven't seen anything out of John Kerry that has impressed me; but the idea of another four years of this frightens me so much, I've actually found myself, a staunch political moderate, being scared into voting Democratic this coming November.  This movie is perhaps the most effective way to rally the masses into feeling the way I do.  The next administration may not be much better, but I can't see how it can do any worse.  If you have not seen this movie yet, you absolutely need to see it, for reasons that go far beyond the normal entertainment value of a summer flick.  By the way, interviewing Britney Spears for her in-depth thoughts on the state of our nation?  Brilliant!
