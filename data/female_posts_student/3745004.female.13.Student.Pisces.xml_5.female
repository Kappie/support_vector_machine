It's like this: It started In school and stuff, right? Yea there was this ride thing in this building. Some of my friends and I went in it and like it was a conveyer belt with trash on it splitting into to was as it went. The trash goes one way and people go other way. But like we were on it and this really big bog of beer type thing went on it and got stuck with broke the ride so my friends and I just walked and sat watching the movie they were playing in there on this great pull down T.V thing. *Movie unknown*. Yea. Then we left and separated. *later* I went back in and sat down bored watching movie. *Beware! This is where fluffy comes in!* This insanely hot boy comes in and sits right by me! I mean WOW! Short black hair kinda anime style and stuff and eyes and tall and OMG! I can't describe his hotness (and in the dream he is also the person that plays Ukchan). I look at him knowing him and like, I have a crush on him. He looks at me and I look at him and stuff. He says to me in his warm voice type thing, "I've always liked you" And I'm all OMG! I love him! And stuff. And like yea. He takes my hand and like yea. He hold hands there and stuff. I lean on his shoulder. And then like yea soon we get up and like walk out holding hands and stuff and I'm all ^^. I start walking in front of him holding both his hands with both mine leaning back on his chest and stuff. And we are just like walking that ways across the quad. There we meet his friends and he talks to them and stuff and I break away from him to go tell my other friends. And like I find friends and things (Bekka and Annie fer some reason) and I tell them and there just like "No fair!-_-; My Ukchan" and I'm all (^-^)v yea. I go back  and another friend runs up to me and are all like "How did you get Mat? (name of boy)" and I'm all like "I was myself" type thing. And then I go back to him and I spend the rest of the dream in his arms. The End!
