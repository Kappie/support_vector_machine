It should have hit me a long time ago, since I've already seen them before. Forest Gump... it made me feel like I'm wasting my time. My mom told me that there is no such thing as a limited person. And I quote, 'Stupid is as stupid does.' Well, something like that. On the other hand, Cast Away made me feel like I was an island in the middle of the sea. I may have everything, but I'm surrounded by merely water.
