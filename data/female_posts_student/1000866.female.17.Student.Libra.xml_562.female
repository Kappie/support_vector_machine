I think I need to write in the third person sometime. Just write about my whole day. It'd be fun. Extraordinarily obnoxious but fun! So, this is what I wrote for Pat;   "Hi. My name is Pat. I'm sure you already know that if you're here though. I think Catie's the coolest kid ever because she doesn't like orange juice with pulp in it and is tempted to go to 7-eleven to get some new orange juice, because she is thirsty and doesn't want water. Anyway, back to me since I'm Pat and I'm awesome. I like to run and I went to Texas over Christmas, and I like to write random things. I also know this sounds like I'm a first grader. It's meant to so stop laughing at Cati...I mean MY ability to write."   I think I need sleep....
