(pretentious, whiney bitch!)  this is, of course, in person (at his house). _____________________________________________  me: conor, i feel like i know you pretty well... c:  yeah, i would say that me: good.  but i kinda ask this of everyone...it's so i don't piss off or offend anyone...but you seem like the type... c:  yeah... me: ...the type that i can speak my mind to. c:  of course. me: that's what you think.  i know you've heard about my crazy mom and all that but that's the kind of stuff i tell everyone. c:  oh.  well, go ahead anyway. me: (grimly smiles)  thank you.  (pause--look around, think a bit)  i don't think you're going to want to talk to me after i say this.  it's going to make me sound really whiney and bitchy. c:  okay... (mimmicking me) me: funnyhaha. c:  go on. me:  it's been a little depressing for me to talk to you lately.  it's not your fault.  i don't know if  you're going to understand this...but every time i talk to you, all i can think of is your one-way ticket to japan and all of the opportunities you have...and a girlfriend(to the reader--think significant other)...a supportive family...lots of caring, interested friends...charisma...  all of that makes me very jealous of you.  i don't possess any of those things, but want them all very, very much.  i'm lost at sea.  i don't know what to do. i'm sorry.  maybe i should leave. c:  oh...don't, please.  how did this come about? me: you don't want to hear it.  it's too painful to explain.  i shouldn't have said anything. c:  (irritated)  then, why the hell did you bring it up? me: i'm sorry.  i'll see you later.  (heads for the door, walks out) c:  (yells out door)  you're going to walk? me: i can't talk to you right now. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ this is the madness i think of as an insomniac.  i wallow in my own sadness and my own inabilities...my own shortcomings.  i need someone to get me out of this funk.  better put, this hellhole.  this is what happens when my best friend is too wrapped up in her "icky boy" to make plans with me.  now i'm thinking terrible things.  i'm leaving.
