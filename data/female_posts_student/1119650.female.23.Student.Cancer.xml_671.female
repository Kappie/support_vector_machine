We had a great time, some yummy food and just laughed like it was our job.  Megan, Billy and I went to Todd  Andrew's game and they won so yay, but we also had a lot of fun mocking people and all the lil "tween queens" who were there at the rink on dates getting dumped.  We headed home for what ended up being a relatively early night.  Saturday was absofreakin'loutely gorgeous!  Andrew and I had a yummy lunch at  urlLink Roly Poly , and I got bit by the baking bug.  So while the boy and Todd stayed indoors playing video games all day I baked peanut butter chip brownies for the boy, and homemade chocolate chip cookies for the house.  (I'm not too bad at the whole domestic thing if I *do* say so myself!)  After their game was over we headed to the theatre to see Kill Bill 2.  Wow.  Just awesomeness there.  If you haven't seen it: go see it!  If you've seen it: go see it again, damn it!  We visited crazy Japanese cult leader, Adam, and then participated in some interesting forestry activities.  Todd and Andrew are probably the 2 of the funniest people ever and the night was just nothing but absolutely side-splitting laughs to the point where my abs are sore today from it.  Hahah.  (Dominoes will deliver...Even to here??...Insert birdhead gestures here)  We watched Andrew's secret girlfriend, Linsday Loughin, host SNL and while the over all show wasn't extremely funny, the skit w. Amy Pohler and Lindsay's sleep over (Rick.rick.rick.rick) was fucking hysterical, I haven't laughed that hard at SNL in a long time and I was just in tears.  Cheesy bread from Dominoes saved the night and we headed off to bed.  Sunday was bacon, egg  cheese day, and veg around the house.  Watched Sum of All Fears and the Flyers disgusting annihilation of the Maple Leafs (yes, I realize "leaves" is the proper plural of leaf, but in the NHL its the "leafs").  I went home and worked on my mom's Mother's Day present (don't forget children, May 9th...this sunday!!)  I think that about does it, but I want to thank  urlLink Andrew , Todd, Megan and Billy for another great weekend.  Catch ya on the flip side kids!
