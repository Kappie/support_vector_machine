Naomi and Paul came over and my mom BBQed for us. We just visited which was nice! We were just talking and talking. Later they left and I was once again bored. Today went by really quick though. I was actually planning on going out today but no one was around to. So, I just stayed here and did nothing. My mom was all crying and was saying that I don't love her or something like that. I didn't know what to do. So her and I ended up having this long conversation. She is better now. I was all depressed and emotional still, so I let some tears loose. You are probaly thinking I am a cry baby...but only sometimes-haha! Really, I am not always like that! But, the good thing is that I am doing a lot better. I finally got the picture posted. I was having trouble at first, but now I have it under control. Man-I need to go to the Valley soon. I haven't seen my family in a while! I miss them too! I also miss BOBBY! I haven't seen him in a long time! The most coolest thing is that we met at church camp. We met the summer of my 8th grade year! It's been a while and we are still good friends! That's what you call a friend. He is so sweet too! HI BOBBY :o) He is going off to college soon though. So, I need to get over there so I can see him! Man-I have no idea what I will be doing tomorrow...hopefully Lucas and Naomi can come over. I wanna do something with them-but more than likely they won't come over. So yah-I am gonna end up going to bed early cause Steve went to bed and I have no one to talk to...o well, I guess I need the rest anyways! I really hope I can get better...I don't like to be sad! I WILL :o) So yuppers...I guess I should head to bed in a lil bit...night!  Love you-M U A H xoxo
