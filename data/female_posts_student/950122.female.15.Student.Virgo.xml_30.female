[Actually, I'd say my dentist yanked it out of my mouth... *rubs cheek*] I'm going to get braces pretty soon. >    Tired........ I feel tired. And hungry. I haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's... 6:20 p.m?! >    Gundam W will be showing on Cartoon Network after Tuesday! Digimon Tamers ended yesterday [I think] and I have only seen 2 episodes of Invader Zim. The one where he makes this one kid his 'best friend', the one where they had to sell chocolate bars to make money... and when Zim invaded Dib's body. Wait, that's three episodes. It doesn't matter anyhoo, I never catch it anyway.
