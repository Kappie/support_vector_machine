Malcolm's buddy Andrew Kaspick has arrived from Winnipeg, and we are having a blast hanging out with him!  Andrew's flight arrived at around 4:20 yesterday afternoon, and we were there to give him a completely embarrassing welcome to Halifax! We took 3 flower leis from work (one for each of us to wear and one to put on Andrew when he came through the gate!), a bristol board sign that read "*Andrew Kaspick* Welcome to the Maritimes!", and a ridiculously awesome giant blue dolphin helium balloon that we named Kaspy! It may not have been a fish, but it was the closest we could get to a fish and figured it was symbolic enough to represent the Maritimes! After all, they don't exactly have oceans full of dolphins swimming around among the wheat fields in Winnipeg lol.  So after what seemed like an hour of being stared at, snickered at, having our balloon admired by every child under the age of 10, and being asked if we had "just flown in from Hawaii", Malcolm and I finally saw Andrew come through the gate at almost 4:30 pm. He looked happy to see us until he saw the assorted welcoming surprises, and then he seemed mortified, particularly when I put his blue lei on him and handed him the string that Kaspy was tied to! haha. We collected his luggage and made our way through the airport to get the heck out of there! Poor Kaspy just wasn't meant to be confined though! As soon as we got outside, the wind started wrestling him from Andrew's hand, and before we knew it, Kaspy had floated right out of his string-tie, and was sailing NOSE FIRST towards the airport! Malcolm screamed, Andrew and I yelled, and we all made a dash to try to catch Kaspy, but it was futile. After narrowly missing an encounter with a woman putting her luggage into her minivan (still nose first!), Kaspy sailed up up and away! We're pretty sure he caused quite a startling disturbance as he sailed past the air traffic control tower, but it was a hysterically funny moment. We watched him drift away for a few minutes and I tried to take a picture of him floating to his ocean in the sky (haha), but I wasn't able to get one. I was able to get a pic of Andrew, Malcolm and I all holding Kaspy in the airport, so I'll have to scan and post them when I get them back. For now, you will have to imagine Kaspy and his shining beauty based solely on the pic above!  Not much else to write, but I will keep updating all week. My birthday is on Friday--3 days to the big 2-5! Presents and donations of cash are more than welcome. :)  B.
