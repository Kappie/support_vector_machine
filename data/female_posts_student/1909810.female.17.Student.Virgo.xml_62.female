A roll of paper towels for emergencies, a blanket if I get cold, an ice scraper if it snows, a flashlight if I can't see, a yearbook if I get nostalgic, a prop from a play in case...i dont know, a rhetoric folder if I forget how to speak, Clue if I get bored, some CD cases for...CDs...? And I think that's it, that's all I remember but whatever.  Well...I'm off to p.e.a.c.e.
