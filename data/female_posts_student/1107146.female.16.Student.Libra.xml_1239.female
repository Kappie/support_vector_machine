BIGBIGBIG.  Wars start like this, because people get too pissed and fight about worthless things. Nationalism, for example. War is retarded. In fact, it's just as retarded as this whole conflict. I'm not sure who is proliferating this argument, but it's ridiculous; I'm not even sure if this conversation is necessary. Friends work things out, and obviously,  very  obviously, if I might add, the two of you are NOT friends; dare I say, enemies? Yes, I dare.  Broken trust is, in fact, quite inconsequential to the whole deal anymore. Whether or not one of you betrayed the other is just one of those miniscule matters that doesn't need to be dealt with, because it happened, and whatever the case, it can't be helped now. It seems sort of pointless having this brawl on Saturday: all that's going to happen is they're going to rip each other's heads off for five hours, whilst I sit back and eat Abby's wonderful cupcakes with sprinkles, just for me :) : the point is, there isn't a damn thing we can say that will change any opinions here, life isn't like the movies, and this isn't going to work itself out peacefully, since history does repeat itself, and history has been a cold-hearted vagrant thus far.  I don't know how this happened, but it's really a terrible shame. After all, having a friend is knowing someone's faults and overlooking them, simply because you call them friend. Alex has been one of my best friends for years. We constantly knock the shit out of each other, call each other faggots, Alex is too conceited and he thinks I'm too melodramatic; and truly, we're both right. But instead of capitalizing on the fact that we're not the best humans in the world, we use it to our advantages and just laugh at ourselves for all the stupid stuff we've done; we laugh at other people; and in the end, whether there are problems with one another, we really don't fucking care, because Alex is my  friend , come hell or high water.  So here's my take on it: no one's going to give any ground for this, and if any ground is given, it will only be temporary: one will find something wrong that the other has done, it will resurrect all these long dead demons, etc.; also, the parties involved are too emotional about this whole deal, it's been  way  blown out of proportion, and we're arguing about the wrong things. And moreover, and yes, I realize I've already said this,  NO ONE INVOLVED IS GOING TO REALLY LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE .   Was anyone really looking for the good way out of this? It could have ended if the parties involved weren't so stubborn, it could have ended long ago, and it might have had a better ending. If everyone else actually truly believes we can get somewhere out of this soon-to-be debacle at Abby's, then I'm all for you, and I'll be at the front row just like the rest of you, catching the teeth as the competition batters each other to no living end, I'll be there until we taste their tears and make the anger our own and totally lose it and never speak to one another again, just because a little spat turned into a never-ending feud, everyone allies with everyone else, and there is no "circle" anymore, it's just loose confederacies as we all try to get the others to see it our way.  But if anyone can see at all what a bad idea this is to carry on with number three, then please back me up, because I'm sure no one can honestly envision any good end coming to a head at the end of that day. Look where all of our good intentions have landed us in this situation this far.
