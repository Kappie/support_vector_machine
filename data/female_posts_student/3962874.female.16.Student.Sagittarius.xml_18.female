They must be on the same mentrual cycle or something. Daniel doesn't like that I write things down, at least I'm pretty sure he doesn't. He wants to read it but feels like he shouldn't. He told me not to write anything about mean about him, but why would I do that? I love you sweetie! Oh yeah, when we got here tonight, we found out that my brother crashed his newly acquired car. Ok, he didn't really crash the car, it's still a little alright. I guess he was showing off to some people who were in the car with him and he wanted to do some fishtails in a dirt area, he over corrected his turns a lot and ended up sliding sideways into a ditch. He blew one of his tires, stuffed another with straw, and now one more has gone flat as of a day later. The body of the car is scratched up with a few small dents, also I guess the frame of the car got a little messed up. I couldn't believe my brother. This isn't the same brother who used to be afraid of driving. He has been acting wierd lately. My brother used to be the nicest guy in the world, and because of it, his "friends" made fun of him all the time. I think that caught up to him and now he isn't taking it anymore. I think he is in a really angry stage, where he says fuck everyone.
