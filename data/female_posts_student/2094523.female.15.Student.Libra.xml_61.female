U can complain all u want but nothing is ever going to change. but hey that doesnt stop me from complaining.  We all know the truth in our hearts but we're always afraid to look into it. Sometimes we get so caught up within ourselves that we forget the others around us. Then again..theyre not  that  important to begin with. haha.    I hate guys who think they can get any chick they want and think theyre so hot when theyre fucking not. I just wanna smash them in the fuckin face and make them even more uglier than they were to begin with. I hate cockiness and arrogant dickfaces and i wish for them to just go away.   Also i hate ppl who talk to me like im a retard especially when im trynna be nice by makin actual conversation when its awkward silences. The little things tend to piss me off than the big things coz its just the small things that happen over and over again if u know what i mean. the big things happen ones in a while. the worthless little thigns happen every hr. im not a retard pissface so u can stop it with the act. put it down coz the only retard i see here is u.
