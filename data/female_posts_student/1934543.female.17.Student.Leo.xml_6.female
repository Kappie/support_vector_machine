I'm prutty proud of what we have done...just becasue how many people can make a friendship out of something that wasn't there before he left to go half way across the world?? Well...that's just what me and Stefan did...we made our lousy relationship into what we could call: kick ass friendship that nothing is gonna seperate us.  Okay...so he's great and he's one of my many best friends...I mean I can't think about him without realizing that he's always gonna be there for me no matter what...there's Stefan then everyone else...that's the way I feel about it.  He's great and I wish that I could have someone like him near me all the time...not odd times of the day on the internet for about 20 minutes...that bothers me...I just want him all the time...oops! I forgot this is his blog..oh well...I dunno...he's great..  Okay...so now to his gurl problems...when I  heard that...I mean I got jealous...becuase I mean I don't like when people have a love life and I don't...okay...so I do kinda...but no that isn't the half of it...I mean I think that I wish I was with Stefan for some stupid reason...maybe so I don't have to be scared anymore...but you know that isn't gonna work..I just want him to be happy...and I mean I know that I have to learn to be happy too...and if he gets with his girlfriend then you know that he is going to be happy...and if not...well he always has me to fall back on...I mean not like that...but he always has me to be there for him...no matter what...always and forever...and I'm leaving it at that...
