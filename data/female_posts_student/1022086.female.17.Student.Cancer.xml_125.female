And get into college. And take over the world. How many fingers am I holding up- none because you're a dirty cheater that thinks he can trick me into believing he is holding up  any  fingers!!! What is your shoe size in the Japanese scale- 42, for my Italian one is also that # Have you ever gotten your foot stuck somewhere- more times than you can fathom  (another subject)  Favorites:  Tree- weeping willow Breakfast food- coffee and Pan di Stelle (go to Italy and find out) Russian made fighter aircraft- just because you're Russian doesn't mean I'm Russian, you Russian! Color- bluuuuuuuuuue!! blue blue blue!!! Virtually all shades and tints, at that. Garden plant as a food (vegetables don't count)- honeysuckle? Way to eat a reeses thingy- I don't like those things Weapon of mass destruction- my cannonballs?  (another subject)  I Would Date:  (yes or no, comments welcome) An off ramp bum- nah A cheezit- of course not, I'd eat it! Saddam Hussein- he's far too ugly for me Someone you met at the landfill- er, I suppose that one shouldn't judge a person by his/her location Any farm animal- Ian, you're sick! Someone you simply know as "hey you!"- very likely not  (another topic)  Religion:  Do you belive in the omnipotence of the Egg Salad Sandwich- no, but I would more than gladly eat it! I'm so hungry! Would you ever join a cult based on aforementioned Sandwich- no, but if they offered me many such sandwiches I bet I'd eat them all! Would you drink koolaid with that sandwich- yesh! Do you wonder what Egg Salad Sandwiches have to do with religion- I think Egg Salad Sandwiches should accompany all sermons. I think it is always a good thing when someone feeds me.
