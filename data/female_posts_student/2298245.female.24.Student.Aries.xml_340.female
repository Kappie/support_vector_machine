It was not much fun growing up with an April Fools Day birthday, but as I was not popular and, as a consequence, no one knew who I was or cared when my birthday was, it could have been a lot worse.  I suppose it probably was for my twin sister (we're fraternal, for those who don't know), who actually was popular, and everyone knew who she was, though I never bothered to ask.  Everyone says it was harder to grow up unpopular, and I suppose that is true where the popular kids make fun of the others.  But mostly, they just let me alone.  Perhaps it was some unspoken understanding between them and my sister, who was among them, that I was not to be harassed.  Hmm...how exactly did I get off on this tangent?  Oh yeah, it's my birthday.  A friend from school brought me some very good chocolate yesterday - and over the course of the day, I ate exactly all of it, save the two pieces I gave away.  Then, I came home last night, and more chocolate had arrived from home.  I didn't eat any then, for fear of getting ill, but I'm sure I'll plow into them today.  I sure do wish chocolate was considered healthy.
