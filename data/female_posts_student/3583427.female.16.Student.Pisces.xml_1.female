I can't say much...I'm not allowed phone of computer. So, I may not be here often. Whatever. Well, take care.  This is Aman, Signing off...For a while.   Songs  that kinda have things to do with my life and how I feel:  "I don't know what's worth fighting for, or why I have to scream. I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean. I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright, so I'm breaking the Habit tonight..." -Linkin Park "Breaking the Habit"  -The Yeah Yeah Yeahs "Maps" -Seether Ft. Amy Lee "Broken" -Linkin Park "In the End" -Simple Plan "Perfect" -Blink 182 "I miss you" -Slipknot "wait and Bleed" -Our Lady Peace "Innocent" -Avril Lavigne "Tomorrow" -Puddle of Mudd "Blurry"  And a lot of other songs, but I bet you're getting sick of reading them, so I'll end it at that. Buh bye.
