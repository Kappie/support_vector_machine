I thought I knew everything about her--her greatest fears, uncertainties, and joys.  But things have been slowly changing.  She isn't the same--or maybe it's me who has changed dramatically.  But I don't think so.  It's one of those relationships that you imagine are for life, from wedding to funeral.  And it's scary that it's not what it will be in reality.  But who can say one way or the other?  Maybe we're just in a rocky stage, but it's hard to think that as a possiblity with some little devil in the back of your mind telling you otherwise.  I've been advised that my next step should be to talk to her.  But I'm sick of talk.  I guess I want a "quick fix," but that is obviously not reality.  I think I'm going to go to the gym to workout and think about it.  That always helps.  Anyhoo, I'm going to this spiritual enrichment thing at SMT tonite.  The topic is "Where the Human Meets the Divine."  Should be interesting.  For some HILARIOUS church humor,  urlLink click here
