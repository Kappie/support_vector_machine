This was followed by an elders/deacons/staff meeting at which I made a quick appearance. Then I met Michael and Bobby at Denny's. Wally showed up a bit later too. We stayed there until about 11:30. When I took Bobby home, he couldn't get in the house. He tried waking up his dad to no avail. He finally had to call his grandmother who brought over a key. Kinda funny. Got home and had to wait for my sheets to dry so I could make my bed. It's now about 1:30am. I am mostly disappointed about the time because I want to read more of Taliesin. I am thoroughly enjoying it--to the point that I'm thinking about it throughout the day. :-) Talk about a nerd!
