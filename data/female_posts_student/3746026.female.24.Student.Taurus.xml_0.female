I now officially don't believe a word of what they say.  My roommate just bought this week's copy and there are 2 stories that I know are completely untrue.  First, it says that Rachel Bilson and Adam Brody were all over each other at the Rock the Vote party last week.  NO!  I was there - they stood by me pretty much the entire night.  There was no "all over each other."  The mingled and talked to a bunch of people, and then only once did he give her a cute little hug.  That was it!  And then there was another story saying Tom Cruise was rockin' out to Jada Pinkett Smith's band at that same party.  Wrong again!  Tom came only for Joss Stone's performance.  He slipped in just before she went on, said hello to her backstage, snuck up to a private balcony to watch her set, then snuck out the back door.  He wasn't even there for Jada's performance over 2 hours earlier!  Alright, I feel good that I've gotten that off my chest.  The crappy thing is, I'll continue to look at that stupid magazine 'cuz I like the pictures.
