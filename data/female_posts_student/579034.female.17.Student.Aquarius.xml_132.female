Rubin and Vin found a dead dog on a bed. Freaky. I would go back I think but only if there were more people with us, just us four wasn't enough. I felt like I was in one of those teenage horror movies that like your watchin and your just like "Look out beind you! Get out of there you sick loser! NO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN!? Don't go into the abandond building!" but yea we went in anyways. Then Deb, Morgan, and Erica slept over and that was great. I love them so much. We watched Head Over Heals and then Grease. Two awesome movies, Grease is just great. Never gets old. Then, Friday I came to my dads. Nothing really happened on Friday except Mick and me deciding a break is the best thing for us right now. I dunno we just kinda been shitty with each other and frustrated and not at all in the best of moods. Everyone is sayin that we will be okay, and if we are meant to be then we will get back together, and that maybe a break is best and ya know, maybe it is. I mean, yeah I love the kid, and I don't want to loose him, but... I mean... what will be will be... life goes on. Then, Saturday was my meet. That was a catastrophy and a half. I was doin awesome for my 400, and at around the 250 mark Alyson spiked me, I stumbled and got off my toes and from then on I hadda put energy into gettin speed flat on my feet which is hard when you've been on your toes for a while. Fucked up my whole time. Saturday night, we went out to dinner with Aunt Donna, Uncle Bruno, Mario and we picked up Brooke cause I told her we would hang out. Dinner wasn't too bad, after Brooke and I rented School of Rock. That was a cute movie. Very well done. ::golf clap:: So yeah, that brings us to today. I got my prom dress. It's really nice and really like tight on top which is good cause my sad excuse for boobs need all the help they can get. It's baby pink and two peiced, it ties up the back and its kinda see threw so I'm gonna have to figure out what to do about that. Maybe I'll be REALLY daring and go commando........................... Or not. But yeah, then we went to this place called Junior Coture and it is my new favorite store cause it's just awesome. Has everything I like and more. I'm not completely forgetting about Abercrombie but.... this place gives it a run for its money thats for sure. Then I came home, packed up my things, finished my homework, asked Mick if he wanted to end this break now (last night he had asked me and I said after Penn, then this morning I woke up feeling stupid so I thought I might as well ask) to which he said "Nah, we can wait till after Penn." I dunno guys I'm kinda scared we just won't get back with each other you know? It's like... yeah lately things haven't been peachy but... I dunno.... things are just crazy... "Burn" by Usher has become our theme or something... it sucks... a lot. But, on a happier note... SCHOOL TOMORROW!!! x0x
