(he twiddles his thumbs) ... i dont like munchkins"   HAHA i dno why but that really made me giggle. my brother called yesterday from jail ... that was interesting - he was in jail for pullin an "the outsiders" and hopin on one of those cargo train thingys ... haha sucker.   it makes me really sad that people hate me so much. i can completely honestly say that i dont HATE anyone. i sure as hell dislike some people - but non without due cause. and here i am on other ppls tag boards and my own and everyones liek "i hate meri i hate meri" and im like "wow that makes me feel so warm and fuzzy inside"   cuz honestly i KNOW i haven't personally done something to all those people - and if i've forgiven everyone i had issues with ... why cant they?  i dno i guess it just bugs me ...  alot ... makes it hard ... to sleep at night ... ;-)   but im gona run cuz i think julies gona be wakin up pretty soon like and  i dno .. i have no more to day. bye bye ~meri~
