Someone with waaaay too much time on their hands (who is, apparently, a random engineer from the TFC community) beat HLSP in 45:45. This is friggin' amazing- no, make that aweinspiring.    http://www.planetquake.com/sda/other/halflife.html    This is Half-Life like you've never seen it before. Remember that pesky dam level? RandomEngy's just too cool for stuff like that, and uses the tau gun to jump up on to the canyon wall. He swims into the void, SKIPPING THE ENTIRE LEVEL. Chicks dig guys that play videogames, and they  really  dig guys that play 'em well.    But he doesn't stop with tau jumps. No, no- that just wouldn't be stylish enough. He skips most of On A Rail, too- how does he do it?    By turning about and using tripmines to create a staircase over some pesky rubble.    Now c'mon people, that's just  KICKIN' RAD.      .....but it doesn't stop there.    No, no. He's rocked your face off, he's owned your socks  right off you feet,  but NO! No mercy, because he's about to do something even cooler. You don't see it coming, but      BAM!     And  there it is.  He turns to the floor, pulls out the snarks, and uses them to boost himself over a fence.    HOLY HELL!    But no. No, that's not all. "THERE'S MORE?!" you cry, but yes!  KEEP YOUR FORK, CAUSE THERE'S FUCKIN' PIE!     Your face has been rocked so hard it's melted off, and your socks have been owned so badly they're across the room in a laundry bin, but there's one thing left yet!!    Remember Xen? Remember that horrible, awful, terrible, really-no-good bad cluster of jumping puzzles?     HE SKIPS THE WHOLE THING     Yyyyeeeep. RandomEngy whips out the tau gun and jumps past the entire first level.    And that, my friends, deserves the Nobel Prize of video gaming.    ....    ...actually, I don't even know who RandomEngy is. I just thought the...speedrun was....cool....    :(
