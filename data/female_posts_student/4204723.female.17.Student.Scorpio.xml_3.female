I was kind of sick of waiting for Bolt.com to get their journals back up so now I showed them didn't I? I'm not bolt dependent anymore. I'm sure you're all glad to hear that :-p.       Anyway, my life has been pretty good right now. I finished the sequel to my story and I decided to title it,   Catarina's Return: The Battle for the Dark Stones  . Pretty good if I do say so myself. Does it make you want to read it? I certainly hope so. However, it is a sequel...and the first one still hasn't been published seperately darn it. That's my next authorian project, to finish editing   Catarina's Quest  .      By the way, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, go ahead and take a look at my website. Really, its my dad's website because he runs it but the books are all there. Or if it's too complicated for you, go to  urlLink http://www.bn.com  and search for   A Journey Into Imagination: The Adventure Begins  . That's the name of the book that my dad and I wrote together. He wrote three really awesome stories, I wrote two. Mine, I'm proud to say, was the longest in the whole book, around 170 pages I think.      Well, I'm not sure what else to say. Maybe I'll leave another entry here sometime later today. I don't really have much to say except hello, and I hope that someone somwhere reads this stupid thing because if I'm just sitting here talking to myself then I feel like a real idiot. ;-) Please someone leave a comment so that I know I'm not all alone in this world!      Oh, and before I go, did you know that J. K. Rowling, author of   Harry Potter   if you don't know, is going to have another baby? I personally hope it's a girl. I really wish she would name one of her kids after a   Harry Potter   character...but something tells me she isn't going to fulfill my wishes. Oh darn. Ok, tis all. Bye now.      ~Katrina
