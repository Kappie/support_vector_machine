Blogger templates suck butt but I guess I'll just have to live with it.  *sigh* Every template seems to mess up after a few months.  Bleeeh.  I redid the comments column once more and made the pic that acts as a header (It's plain but prettiful, see?).  Yosh!  Time to bring this blog back to life!  Ahaahhahaahhaha!  *standing on a rock with waves splashing around her* >:D
