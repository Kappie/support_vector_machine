And then like a million late night rehearsals for the play which was a HUGE success!!  It was so good!  People were comparing it to university plays and how we have met the standards and on the last night we got a standing ovation.  Tommow we have to take down the set though and well I think the cast party is next Friday, but I have to get my nails done for my sisters wedding.  Today for Bio we went to the Bridlewood creek, which was fun but really wet because of the rain.  And well this one day in Bio we were using one of those machines that measures blood pressure and I thought it was cool so I got my blood pressure taken and it was like really high.  Then I was kind of worried and have been paying attention to things more in detail.  I have also been having like a million muscle spasms in my right arm but I went to the doctor today and said that is normal, but my blood pressure was high and they took my pulse then decided it would be best to do blood work.  So yeah my arm is slightly sore, but not as bad as before.  I am really worried though.  I have lost a bit of weight over the last couple days and am worried because I keep having to eat to feel good.  I eat breakfast - a good breakfast but need something before lunch and usually after lunch I don't feel good by 2:00 pm.  That worries me, along with this strange thing that goes on with my hands and toes.  I feel warm everywhere on my body except the fingers and toes are absolutely freezing and like my mom described it like in-depth to the doctor today cause even she was kind of worried cause she is always like "omg how can you be that cold?" and like I really don't know.  Even on the really hot day that we went to Father Whelihan to do Drama scenes (It went really well and our scences were amazing) even then my fingers were freezing and the temp outside was like over 20 degrees.
