We had a big fight right after I posted my thoughts, all about our time management issues and how he tries to control me and my time too much, and I get too lazy and unmotivated about papers and then get sick when we have time together. But we washed my car together, which was covered in crow shit, and we both felt better about getting something productive done. Now he's gonna go for a run with his brother-in-law, and I'm gonna work on my lame-ass paper that I'm conflicted about. I'm just going to pick a topic and outline the entire thing tonight, and then we'll hang out with Kier and Trina and have fresh pasta. Now to work....
