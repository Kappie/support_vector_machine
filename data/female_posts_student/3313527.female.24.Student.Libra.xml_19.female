I overslept by a whole hour , still exhausted from a recent adventure to Cambridge and back, another long day of travel and open house-ing at Smith college, and classes to boot. I had to drive like a jackhole to get from Smith to class in time for an exam yesterday, and I just made it.   2. After being awake for less than 30 minutes, I was out driving and  I saw a man get hit by a car . An old man. An old man with a cane. A confused old man with a cane. The woman who hit him was a younger woman, and got out of the car and looked so freaked out and someone pulled over and tried to help, so I just drove on, wondering if I should have stopped since I saw the whole thing I could have given my account to the cops. But it seemed like others had already stopped, and I was running late... and I'm sure it wouldn't matter "outside of a small circle of friends"... He just got hit by the corner of her car, she was probably going 25 mph so it was low impact but still he flipped a few times and it was an upsetting and jarring morning. Could have been worse: I could have hit him, or been hit myself.   3. I went to the dentist and  they hit me up for $700  out of the blue (or is it $300? The bills are confusing and they still can't seem to figure out what portion my insurance is covering). I have been paying them $30/month every month for awhile now, and all seemed fine. Well, today things have apparently changed and they were so kind to write up a payment plan for me and now if I don't start paying them $76/month they will send the bill to collections. No warning, no nothing. And here I was thinking I was being so good for making timely payments. What I hate the most is how presumptuous these companies are when they set you up on a payment plan: they just assume you can afford whatever the amount  they  want is, it's never like 'oh, $30/month, okay, we can work with that', or looking for some compromise or something. It's just what they say, or its off to collections we go.   4. And did I mention while I was at the dentist they told me that  I might need a root canal ? Oh yeah, there's that. And with my insurance running out in September when I go back to school, lord knows when that will happen or if it will at all, again depending on what insurance will cover. Been thinking about dentures... or maybe just pull the tooth and give me a silver one or something. I'd like a copper tooth. That would be killah.  5.  Now I'm at work for 8 hours, which is a very particular kind of hell .  6. My  nutritional intake  has consisted of chocolate, water, yogurt and avocado rolls for a few days now. Am I in danger of rickets or anything?
