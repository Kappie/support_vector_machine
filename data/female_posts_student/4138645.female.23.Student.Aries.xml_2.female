It started out a slow night, Schmiller was going shot for shot with Jackie, so she was feelin pretty good, I was still HURTING from the night before (where was I, hmm Paninis with Eve, Hollie, and Kim...oh yea that's where I met Mike this really nice kid that we are so gonna hang out with, anyways), i was not up to another marathon night, PLUS some jerk tried to steal money out of my credit card, so a new one is on the way, i hate people, so i was credit cardless for the weekend, aka. moneyless, I had checks, and bars don't take checks much to my dismay!! We went to this bar called Jake's and her friends were nice, I met some new friends too, Mike and Dave, they looked lonely at the bar, so we kept em company, well Jackie did, she was a hoot, WASTED!!  Well, we chilled there for a while, then Sara's other friends got there, Josh and Zachary...so we left and went to another bar, the Ale House, DEAD, so we hopped next door to Jax, which was semi-dead but better than nothing, I was falling asleep at the bar i was so freaking tired!!  At that point I was ready to drink anything, as long as it would wake me up.  We left there and went over to my little pumpkin Scott Haas' house, he lives in Toledo now, he's only 20 so house parties it is for two more months for Scottie, it was so nice to see Scottie, I missed him, his girlfriend was there, I met her, and she turned out to be from Jackson, WIERD!!  We drank some Keystone Light with them (ewie) and sara downed some Goldschlagger for shits and giggles, (barf) and we ended up going back to this kid's (craig's) house to crash, Scottie came over and watched cartoons with me for a little bit, it was ONLY 3am..ha ha, sara passed out, only after calling everyone in her phone book, and emailing everyone she knows, INCLUDING her professor from school, which should turn out wonderful!!  She didn't do two of her papers, so we gotta fib!!  OH well, we woke up at like ten o clock and went back to her parents house, her mom, o my gosh, made us this breakfast large enough for an army, french toast casserole, cheesy hash browns, watermelon, strawberries, canteloupe, ham, sausage, blueberry muffins, cheery cheesecake desserts, and Jello, stromboli, and all sorts of stuff to take home with us, they are just so funny with her, they send soooo much stuff home with her!  I got home sunday about 4, sara worked at 4:30, I cleaned up the stuff at the house, and came home.  I crashed when i got here, i was so tired, I think i did something else, I just can't remember!!  For now, that's all ya need to know though...hee hee, later gaters
