And actually managed to speak with a woman (from an all time favorite company that i won't disclose here) who lamented the decreased toy development time. See, once upon a time, a toy company could spend 4 years developing a toy.  Four years of tweaking and testing, researching and quality.   Now, most places spend 2-4 months developing a toy until it is ready for the shelf.   This might be why people think "the toys of today are crap, now the toys of my youth..."
