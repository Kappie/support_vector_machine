       
      As you can see, the new blog changes are underway.  I am having trouble getting the buttons I have to add to line up in the way I want them too.  But I do not have the patience to try and figure it out right now, so I'm going to take a break.  Still have gotten nothing useful (aside from this) done today.  Where, or where does all the lost time go?
