I got a 43 on my first try. Quite slow if you ask me, it's all the darn mouse fault. Anyway, let me know when you get bored with this game too and I'll try getting another one.  My new fridge is coming today! New fridge = bigger space = more food! Woot! This equation, I like! My parents aren't around, so the onus is on me to make sure that this huge ice box makes it safely to our kitchen. Unscathed, unharmed, sparkling clean. They gave me a briefing last night on what to look out for. Scratches, accessories, receipts, delivery orders and what-nots. But the point is...I have a thick wad of notes in my pocket right now! *evil cackle and furtive eyes* Umm...*straightens up*...the money is for the fridge, yes, I'll make sure it gets into the correct hands...
