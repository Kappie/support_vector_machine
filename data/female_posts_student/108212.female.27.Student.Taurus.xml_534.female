Brian has tried to make me watch many of the titles on your list (yes, including  Spaceballs , which is apparently one of his favorite movies -- I didn't say all movie buffs had taste -- no offense, Daf). About the only thing on that list that I would call a favorite of mine would be  Robin Hood: Men in Tights . I've never seen most of them and to tell you honestly, they are not my to watch list. I can tell you this, though: Brian has seen all those movies on your list and he loves them all. What is it with you Americans? Just kidding!
