Is it worth to, begin something; you don’t know if it will last till tomorrow? Is it worth to, dream… knowing someday, you may wake up from a nightmare? Is it worth to, Love… when you know, you will feel pain?  Everyone who loves someone else knows what real pain…is Love is a good pain, sometimes, but can also be excruciating when… - You fear for the other - You’re left alone for awhile - You don’t know if it’s still there - You know there will be an end someday  Everything comes and goes… away Nothing lasts forever… Not even the stars, the moon, or the sun  But one thing I’m sure: Love doesn’t die, with ones death After I go away…  I’ll get my Angels Wings… and Love Forever  ] -[ellMistress * Angel who can’t fly
