I cannot wait until the holidays, I'm going to Sydney for the first week and the second week I plan to bum around, draw and stuff..maybe start putting together a portfolio for my art and ring my mums friend Bob Smith (an artist who did the storyboards for the new Peter Pan movie) so he can maybe get me a job drawing story boards.  I REALLY need a job.  I don't want one of the usual, boring, cleaning-fat-out-of-the-chicken-frier-at-the-supermarket job. I should have taken that job awhile ago..teaching kids at the youth centre how to make webpages.  I am -so- retarded.  I really want to do this animation course at Griffith, it looks really interesting. Wow, alot of my sentences start with "i"    My grandma wants to buy Aki and I a laptop each..yay  (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) She Probably wants someone to direct her spoiling on... now that the "golden boy" (my cousin Juno) has moved to Sydney..and it's about time. I mean, he only has:  FROM WHEN HE LIVED HERE AND WENT TO HIGHSCHOOL •his own television •cd player •millions of clothes  •surfboard + wetsuit •Probably an Ipod or something similar. •random cash handouts • TRIP TO JAPAN!!!!!!  + STUFF  SINCE HE HAS MOVED •Laptop •Rice Cooker  •wok •a whole lot of other cooking junk •random large handouts of money  ALL FROM HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just coz he is a stupid lil suck up... *grr*
