I think the design and decoration is pretty cool (they have a HUGE food court area, unlike most other arena places).... but seating and acoustics SUCK!  When you're sitting down, unless you have short legs, it feels like you've got the head of the person in front of you in your lap.  I was constantly trying to make sure I didn't accidentally knee the guy in front of me in the back of his head.  :-(  Acoustics could be better... but I guess that the SBC Center wasn't really designed for the sole purpose of holding concerts... It was mostly made so the Spurs could have a new home... even though they had a perfectly fine one at the Alamodome... and I fully believe the city just wanted to spend some money somewhere.    The grounds were pretty much the same... except the big breezeway garage-type thing where they had all the different booths... that's not used anymore... instead they used the Coliseum for this... which was nice, because it was good to get in out of the cold for a bit.  Food was basically just as good... minus the Van De Walle fajitas... that's pretty much a tradition with my family... I got 2 chicken fajitas... and they tasted like unseasoned chicken.  I guess they didn't feel like using fajita seasoning on them.  : (  The Blooming Onions were spectacular, minus the outrageous price of $6!  We didn't get anything else other than sodas... and lemme tell you... only in an arena can you buy a bottled soda for $3.50.      Update    I'm getting nice and behind on readings... of course.  Just as always, I go into the semester with intentions of being ahead in readings... and I always (somewhere after the first month) get completely behind in them all!  >O  Oh well, just gotta catch up maybe this weekend.  This Saturday I'll be going to Kerrville... to celebrate my Dad's birthday with my Grandma and everyone else.  Plans with Jamey to celebrate her 21st have been postponed.  Her parents are taking her out to dinner, and then by the time she's done with that Adrian's supposed to get off work and they were gonna go out.  We may do something the next weekend... may not.  Just depends on how things pan out.  She offered my coming along with her and Adrian... but I figure they probably REALLY wanna be alone.  Plus, I don't wanna watch them during their foreplay knowing that they'll end up shacking up after I'm gone and they're at his place.  ACK!  Other than that, not much is going on.  I talked to Mike for all of a few seconds to say "hello" and "goodbye" earlier today.  He's cute... and he's different, but he's not the type of person I wanna end up with... so I figure it's a waste of time to date him.  But, then again... only time will tell... and things could change.  Whatever... whatever happens shall happen!  :D  Okay... no more... I'm tired of updating today... I'll post later in the week...       urlLink  postCount('4Feb2003');
