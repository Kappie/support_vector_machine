The pain just stopped all of a sudden. But it was after Mike made me cry. I asked him to work for me cause I didn't feel great and I didn't want to deal with this place while I was in pain. It only makes it feel more like hell. And I begged him and begged him and he said he'd think about it, but he wasn't serious. I didn't find that out until I called him to ask if he'd decided. Then, I begged and begged some more and he said I can't and I'm hanging up. I was sad then. Not so much now, cause I feel better. But I was then.  The date of the conception of Mike and Heather's quadruplets will be December 13, 2004.  I feel much better now. :P  It's going to cost 700-900 dollars for my root canal. Otherwise I could just get the tooth pulled. But anyone who knows me well knows that I'm just a little too vain for that. It's the 2nd tooth(going back) from my fang. Yes, I have fangs!!  Seen any good porn lately? I haven't. It's funny though. I heard from one of my friends that one of my other friend's husband was mad at her (his wife) because he found out that she was 'entertaining' herself without him. The porn was in a different spot. He went all bitch on her. Like he normally does. I don't understand why guys are that way. Don't they know that if we wanted someone as feminine as us, we'd marry chicks. I don't want a guy who would get angry if I called him a chunky bastard one day. Not that I would call him a chunky bastard. I would if he knew he was chunky. Cause, you know how someone people live in denial. They swear they are still a size 10 just because the button hasn't popped off and clocked Tracy in the eye yet. Hell I've been there.  I want another cigarette.  Ladies when we go camping in August I think we should bring the vodka and the potatoes. VODKA POTATO BASEBALL!!!!!  I'm really looking forward to being away from work. Doing something fun.  I'm officially back to pt August 22. Then I'll have about 2 weeks of freedom. I think I might take the full two weeks off to do absolutely nothing but wallow in self pity. I haven't been able to just dwell on shit that's beyond my control since I started this damn thing.  I have to go do my round, but I'll be back to add on to this blog in an hour or so.  K, I'm back now.  I was thinking that maybe I should buy a dog.  I want a dog.  Dogs are pretty.  I want a mouse too.  A gray one or brown one.  Then, I will make it a little hat and a red and white striped shirt and I will call him gus.  Like Gus-gus from cinderella. One time, when I was in the hospital, my mom's friends bought me a giant stuffed rat.  I called him Gus-gus.   I don't know why I came back.  S'not like I had something to talk about.
