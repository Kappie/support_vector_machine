The Stills are a complicated case, though, inspiring equal amounts of pleasure and horror, like that dream in which everyone has mozzarella genitals.    I mean seriously, not only is that fucking hilarious, but it helped me in  not  purchasing that album. Also, I bought Franz Ferdinand on iTunes, and yeah, Pitchfork rocks my socks off for that. :D  //rocks out  Anyhow, going to see  Harold and Kumar  in a few, a review when I come home :D
