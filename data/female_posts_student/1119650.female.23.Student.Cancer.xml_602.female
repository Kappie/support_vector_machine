It makes transporting my tasty medium french vanilla, light and sweet with milk (not cream) a treat.  I also like drinking from it.  I wish more cups would hop on the sippy lid bandwagon.  Your cups are superior to Starbucks', because not only are you killing the environment with the styrofoam, but I can still close it with the neato cup fastener unlike your competitor who shoots hot magma coffee out around turns and bumps.  Thank you for making my day and thank you again for firing the idiot redhead woman who always messed up my order.  That was swell of you.
