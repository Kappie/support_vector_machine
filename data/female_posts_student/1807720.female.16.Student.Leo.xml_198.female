I feel very prepared though.  Today was good and I went to school and we performed our Drama Final Project.  Then I went to Tim Hortons and got my fav: BlT bagel, iced tea, and a crueler.  I felt really nervous this morning for some reason.  I didn't even have a final today, and I was nervous.  I was probably nervous cause I know a whole bunch of people were writing their Chem finals and Diploma's today.  Maybe I felt nervous for them.  I think the reality that it's actually the time of finals is starting to kick in.  I do know though that I am 100% capable of doing good on Bio.  I know the stuff.  I studied.  I worked hard.  I asked questions.  I know what I need to do and I am going to do it.  Believe in yourself and you will succeed.  Oh and I saw Ms. LaCour in the hall today.  It's odd how when I was in her Chem class she would say "hi" to me in the hallways.  Now she doesn't even say anything.  It's like she's pretending she's invisible or something.  She did smile at me, cause I smiled at her.  Maybe she thinks I don't like her or something, but that's not that case.  Actually she's one of the best teachers because she's different and she doesn't go changing her style of teaching or whatever to suit your needs.  She has the coolest style - love the clothing.  I actually look up to her as a role model, but shhhhh...that's my secret.  No one needs to know that.
