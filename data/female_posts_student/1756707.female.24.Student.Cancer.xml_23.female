Scoop out the flesh, and chop roughly.  I usually do this with a wooden spoon after all the avocado is in the mixing bowl.  Add chopped tomato and onion.  Add cilantro, lime juice, vinaigrette dressing, and spices to taste.  Mix 'em all up.   Great  with Hint of Lime chips.  This will keep overnight in the fridge, but probably not much longer than that.
