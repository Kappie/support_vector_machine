But I always manage to have fun during rehersals, so that is a very good thing.      So far, I have not done anything for Accounts, because nobody has spent anything. I know that Accounts is now under Publicity/Marketing, but I'm still not sure of whether our group is included in all publicity events like letter-writing and poster-pasting because nobody has told us what to do. I do hope we can get the accounts started soon though...       Acting-wise, I'm still trying to memorise my lines. I did think I had them memorised until I tried to say them without the script and said "ru guo wo men zhen de you yuan..." instead of "ru guo ni men zhen de you yuan...". Which is a  very  big mistake. I am beginning to hate that line. Argh. I can't say it at the right speed, without sounding too pleased that Kaijing is dead.           I also said lines at the wrong times. -___- So yeah. More work needed. (I just don't feel confident without the script!) Maybe we should rehearse more often, with all the characters present. Or maybe run through all the scenes at once. We haven't rehearsed with the props either. *screams* I can't believe we only have one month left.
