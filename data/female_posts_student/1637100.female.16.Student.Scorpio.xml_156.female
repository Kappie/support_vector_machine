He will help me through. i will try my best to keep a happy face on and i will be optimistic. no more of this pessimistic bullcrap. from now on i refuse to let that take over my life. it can be quite depressing at times. it even drives me to do things that i wouldnt normlaly do. no i didnt do anythign stupid, but i did think about doing stupid things many times. but that is not me anymore. i have come to the realization that it is stupid to waste my life obsessing over things of the past that i cannot change. i will let everythign happen thats going to happen and i will adjust and adapt to whatever comes my way. anyways. you probly get the point im trying to make. whoever is reading this sad excuse for a web page which didnt take any HTML skill whatsoever because it's all pre-made. and im too lazy to make it better coz i know i can, but im too lazy so that "redesign" thing is going to have to wait. =D  anyway. yes. tomoro is a better day. just like that out of eden song. LOL today i am hung up on finding songs to relate to my life. i do that a lot actually. anyways. i am hapy now. and i am going to practice flute for a bit now. end my wonderful msn convos and go upstairs practice flute for about 20 mintues and then watch tv until my eyeballs fall out. good night all =D
