Are your thoughts in a haze The nights are long And so are the days? Everything is in a blur You feel as if there is no cure? You try to avoid When in all reality you want to fill the void? You want to run But you can’t seem to hide Your heart feels like it’s about to die Are you crying for no apparent reason Your moods changing like the four seasons? You are hungry, but not for food You know in your heart what would satisfy you Does the distance between us kill you like it does me? At times are you finding it hard to breath? Are you caught in a trap and there is no way out? Making you angry enough to want to shout? Do you feel like you are going out of your mind Everything you do lately is a waste of time? If you feel these things, then you feel the same as me Constantly fighting a battle, losing inner peace Don’t you think it’s time you come back to me? I LOVE YOU!!!!!
