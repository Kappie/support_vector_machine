Finally, i watched Chamber of Secrets in video/vcr. Is there something wrong with me? Nope, as far as i know i'm still normal.   Well, i think that the second movie of Harry Potter was the coolest. It's because of his face. He was more cuter than before.  More experience than before. And gained more talent than before. So cute. How did he do that? Well, i know one thing. He is really handsome....
