I've never even made a webpage, have no idea on the technical ins and outs of doing so, but this seemed easy enough so here it is!   Recent News:    It's a  beautiful  day here in Halifax, a bit cold, but we are finally getting some long-awaited sunshine! And do you think I'm out enjoying it? Of course not! I am cooped up here in the apartment instead, plugging away at a silly psychology assignment! Oh well, it has to be done and there will (hopefully) be many more nice sunny days to enjoy in the near future.   I found out last week that I have been accepted into the Psychology Honors program at Dalhousie ( YES!!! ), so I will be working on an honors thesis and graduating (yikes!) next year. I worked my ass of this year to get into the program so I am thrilled that my hard work paid off! I'm really excited about my honors project! It's kind of a spin-off on the work I have done in Dr. Porter's lab in the past two years, so I'm happy about that. Dr. Porter is my formal supervisor, though he will be on sabbatical next year, so I will be working mainly with Kris Peace, an awesome PhD student! The project will examine moderator variables of instrumental homicides in psychopathic and non-psychopathic homicide offenders--Kris has tentatively titled the project  "Investigation of the Psychological Correlates of Instrumental and Reactive Aggression" . I'm proud to say that my name is now on several of the lab pages, identifying me as Dr. Porter's honors student for 2004-2005! If you want to check it out, go here:   http://is.dal.ca/~sbporter/index.htm  Malcolm, Riley, Woochie and I are all looking forward to playing host to Malcolm's friend Andrew, who will be moving here from Winnipeg next week. He's taking a position at Thor, Malcolm's stomping grounds from last summer, and will be staying with us until he finds a place of his own. We're really excited that he's moving here! He's really into hiking and outdoors-y things, so we're planning on taking full advantage of that!  Not much else to report beyond that. Keep checking back for more updates! :)  Brianna aka Nook Nook
