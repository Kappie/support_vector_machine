Let's see here.... got a haircut....hate block scheduling...but only on the days I have english, math and science in a row.... read Tracy Lorenz's article.... played golf today with Kayle....watched survivor last night....been groovin' on an imaginary Hawaiin rollercoaster ride..... aannnNnNnNnnNNndd thats about it.   Oh!   I have to work tomorrow at 'Community Day' for student senate.   Who wants to got to the highschool on a SATURDAY at 8:45 in the morning?   ::In Spartan cheerleader voice from Saturday Night Live::   Not me, not me.  ******     I know that one word will always make me float. The syllables will always make my feet leave the ground, defying the law of gravity; just because you said them. The word that I will associate with being both scary and exhilarating at the same time. When it is spoken, my thoughts will always drift back to you.   Your smile, your bright eyes, the cute dimple on your cheek.... the one I want so much to place my finger upon, if only I just got close enough.   But like other things, you are too far away.   Why can't I muster the nerve to break down the barrier that I have build so high in my mind; the one as strong as steel, while still as fragile as a spider's web?  I admit I do know why...   It is because I'm just more comfortable in the background.   I can't put myself out there..... where ever 'there' may be.  All I content myself with is that one word.   I nibble at it.... savoring each little speck that rolls off my tongue. I'm careful to make the flavor last, so I won't be jaded the next time I hear it. Which is not often; so when my ears are tickled with the pleasant sound vibrations directed towards me, I am all the more satisfied.  And all the more thinking of you.  ******  Song of the Day: 'Sleep With All the Lights On'- Dashboard Confessional
