But we'll make it through, somehow-- will do, will do!    "When the Rain Comes" by Third Day   When the rain comes It seems that everyone has gone away When the night falls You wonder if you shouldn't find some place To run and hide Escape the pain But hiding's such a lonely thing to do  I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again I can't stop the rain, but I will hold you 'till it goes away  When the rain comes You blame it on the things that you have done When the storm fades  You know the rain must fall on everyone  So rest a while It'll be all right For no one loves you like I do  I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again No, I can't stop the rain, but I will hold you I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again I can't stop the rain But I will hold you 'till it goes away  When the  rain comes, I will hold you
