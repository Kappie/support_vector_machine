The song is kind of lame though. I have no recording, no accompaniment, not even a tempo marking. Just the melody. The chords are marked in though, so I'll take a stab at writing a piano part. It is very "uncool" (haha) that I have to go to my Dad's this weekend. He does not own a computer that has internet access. I know you're all thinking "Oh no, I won't get to read Liz's blog for the next two days!". And sadly, you are correct. No internet means no blogging, sorry kids. Oh well. You know what else sucks? Snowball Ball is tonight and I am not going. Yeah, kind of depressing. Boys suck anyway. Unfortunitely, I will miss seeing if Mike Wronski is crowned "Prince". I would have paid the 25 bucks or whatever it was to go. Haha, soooo funny. Oh well.
