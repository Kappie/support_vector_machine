I combined them because...well... Jar  is about seven songs, whereas  SAP  is five, so with those twelve, also taking into account that AIC never was a "monster 72041873041943 minute long ballad" band, I put a s'more on there...such as  Died  and  Get Born Again , the two new unreleased ones...well, newish. And really old ones like  Chemical Addiction ,  Suffragate City ,  Queen of the Rodeo  and  I Can't Have You Blues !, all AIC classics that never really got their own album...well, they're from a famous bootleg called  Heroin  that met the wild some time ago; the songs are ultimately prophetic, pointing to "the rockstar lifestyle" as their way, with such lyrics as "I don't know much about heroin but I wanna try, just about everything once before I die"...from  Chemical Addiction , and how true it became.  But hey, JERRY'S still here! For a while, saw some pics of him at a private concert just a few months ago...uhoh. Jerry's getting really thin, those permanent deep bluish-purple circles under his eyes concurrent with massive heroin abuse. Bet Jerry'll get snatched before too long, and I will then cry until my lungs die or my heart explodes, more from effort than from grief. I mean, I love the guy but he's the one killing himself. But still... Jerry must be heard...how can he be heard when he's dead ? Answer me this! I dun want Jerry to die! But I'll still listen to his stuff so all will be well, I don't feel much like making a Jerry crusade as of now, it's humid and looks like we're in a fer a nice little night.  Question: spill what?
