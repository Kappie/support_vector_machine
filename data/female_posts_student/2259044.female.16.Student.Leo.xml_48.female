(not exactly, but u catch the fear) also, my friends r changing a lot! i mean, they've spread out, and there's kind of some conflict going on, and it's just like i wanna hang out w/some and then some others, and sometimes i don't know wut the other ones r thinking....and ya... "girls r drama!" but ya no, gotta love'em, cuz wut ya gonna do? zactly! muah, changedfish
