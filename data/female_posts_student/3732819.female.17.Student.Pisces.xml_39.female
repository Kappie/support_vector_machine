Anyways yeah, its 3:00pm...Val's been up for maybe about 2 hours, due to Mike's wonderful wake up call :) its a cute voice to wake up to for sure:) I love talkin to him, although he does more of the talking than anyone else, but thats alright! I still need to ask him some questions though. He told me a story that made methink and want to ask him more questions...so i'm just waiting for him to call back....and i dunno, don't see to be ablet to work up the courage to talk to him, probably cause i'm scared of what i might hear. But theres only one way to find out right?:) So i guess we'll see then:) I shall up date and get back to you on that:) But yeah, Mike's tellin me he wants to be my boyfriend and stuff, cause i was tellin him about one of mine, and that one of the sweetest boyfriends i've had was Shane, and he said "until i come along" and i said "well we're not going out" and then he said "oh just not yet, oh so you dont' want me to be your boyfriend" yes i refused to get into a battle wtih him about that so i just said i'm not playing this game at all. so yeah. but i dunno what to think. like he talks to me the most ont he phone, we talk every night. Like yesterday we did talk, but he said that he was going to call meback. Mike is the type of person who calls back if he says that he does, if he doesn't he says sorry or has a reason to not call. So by then 12:00am rolls aroud so i'm thinkin alright, whatever he's busy. Then i get a text message from him saying that he's sorry he didn't call and that he'll call tomorrow and he misses me. Blah here i'll type out the message: Hey sorry i didn't call tonight will tomorrow miss you night. So that was it, i got the mesage and it made me happy. But then he calls me today and tells me that he was ont he phone with a chick from 10 - 12, when he text messaged me. So i looked at this in many different perspectives. #1. He got off the phone with a chick and he still took the time to message me before he went to bed, which shows that he was thinking about me #2. he was on the phone with another chick, and he's telling me that he wanted to talk to me. I dunno, i know that we're not going out or whatever, but i dunno, he goes telling me about this chick Jenna, and i dunno whats going on between them. He sounds fond of her, but then he doesn't, so i really don't knwo what to think, and he actually told the girl Jenna abotu me, cause she asked him sorta jokingly "so how many other girls you talk to?" and he told her that he talked to me. She got all defensive and shit like that, questioning him and stuff. I dunno...like i said i need to talkt o him to ask him a few questions. So hopefully that'll be figured out. He says he doesn't like beating around the bush but sometimes he does it without realizing it even. He's a cutie too cause when i told him i went to playdium with Sabz, Raye, Fabio, and Shane. The first thing out of his mouth was, ohhhhhhh so your cheating on me now? but he's always like that, i know he ain't serious so its all fun and games, but whatever. Why am i thinking so much about a guy that i've never met before?! i think its just cause i've been talking to him so much ove rthe phone, so he kinda grows on me i guess. *shurg* ....3:13pm....do you know where your children are? i'm hungy.....val wants food...but she doesn't wanna make it...SOMEONE MAKE HER FOOD GOD DAMN IT! ARGH!!!! okay! i'm pissed it just made me think! Yes! see okay, my brother was suppose to be working on Tuesday, and i was going to have my friend Mike come over while he was a twork cause my brother was suppose to start work at 2....but then at dinner the other night he tells me that he doesn't work for 6 days and i'm thinkin, uh nooooooooooooooo your workin Tuesday, and he's like NOPE they didn't want him working then anymore. I was flippin pissed off cause i had to cancel my date on tuesday! so now i have to push it back another week, which hopefully my brother will be working every day next week!! grrrrrrr so pissed!!!! i was totally looking foward to seeing Mike....okay...wait....this is confusing for you people....there are two different Mikes, one on the phone and another one is my friend...okay Mike V. is the phone on the phone and Mike E. is my friend.
