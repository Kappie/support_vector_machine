My friend Catie started blogging almost 2 years ago and I'm addicted to her site, so since I like to write, I thought I would start one of my own.  I'm just a little cautious though because I know I'll have to be careful about what I write, especially when I write about people.  Maybe I should use code names...  Speaking of addictions, my brother plays this game Starcraft for hours on end and refuses to get off the computer so I don't know how often I'll be able to write.  For those of you who have never written in a blog before, I must say its kind of weird.  Usually one writes with an audience in mind, knowing who's going to read it and its hard when you have absolutly no idea.  Oo.. I just previewed my first blog and I got shivers.  How exciting!   My sister wants to get on with her friend and research Harry Potter. Until next time amigos~~
