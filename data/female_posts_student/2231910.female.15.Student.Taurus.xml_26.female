This is my second time going. It is quiet fun and a little boring. Ya.. noe a new fren call Sarah. She is a nice girl ya... Then we ( three of us) go to IKEA to eat. We eat Beef Meatballss.. Yummy!!! Feel so bloated now. Hehee... I hope tonite i am able to sleep in peace. Cos the other time when i go to the celebration, those pple over there say some prayer to me and it really scared me so much . When i went home, i started crying becos my mind is so confuse ya.. then since tat experience i dun even dare to go to any christine or catholic thingy. But today , Misa call me to go with her ya.. so i just go. Hehee...  Gonna stop rite here.
