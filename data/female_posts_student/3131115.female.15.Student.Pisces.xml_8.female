I got a new shirt,~*HATCHETMAN* FOR PRESIDENT 2004~, and other shit. The Family is coming around 1:00, grr. Im excited about watching Kill Bill Volume 1 with William Tuesday. Hopefully tomorrow, I'll be able to go to his house. hehe, I can't wait to be in his arms. Other than that..life is going okay. Thank "god" that I have William in my life. I dont know what I'd do without my Booskie. I dont really have much to say right now. There's nothing really on my mind at the time. So ehh...I'll write later.    AHHH! Day is ruined. I finish and my mom comes in and tells me the WORST news I possibly wanted to hear. Easter, once a day of joy and smiles..Now a day of hate and frowns.    Cant I ever be happy for JUST ONE DAY?!?!!
