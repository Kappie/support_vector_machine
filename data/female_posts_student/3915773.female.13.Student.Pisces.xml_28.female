Some of the stipulations are no more than 12 minutes of commercials per hour, four minutes and less during every commercial break, and no more than six ads during any single commercial break. There are just too many ads. In the first five months of this year ad spending has risen 4%. Also, the average listener hears 3 hours less of radio a week comparedto10 years ago. As chief executive concluded,  "If you have listened to the radio at all, you know that there is an amazing amount of commercial and promotional inventory. So much so that we have run the risk of diluting our product." Clear Channel is hoping to bring back listeners who tune out during commercial breaks. Also, pressure from Clear Channel having fewer commercials may cause other radio stations to limit advertisements too.    Finally, the radio industry has caught on to the demand of the public. I have to say that I am one of the compulsive station switchers as soon as a commercial is being aired. When I am listening to the radio, I want to hear music. If I wanted to hear advertisements, I would turn on the T.V. and watch infomercials. My experiences say that for every half hour of radio, 20 minutes is music and 10 minutes are dedicated to commercials, which is about 20 minutes an hour. I am all for the limiting of commercials. I think this is a great company move by Clear Channel considering other outlets of music are growing more popular everyday such as satellite radio, I-Pods, and MP3 players. Most of my friends don’t even listen to the radio because they prefer CDs. However, the limitations of commercials I doubt will keep people, especially channel surfers, on the same station during commercials. Listeners will have a sense of ease knowing that there will be about 8 minutes less of advertising which means more music. Radio companies aren’t interested if people stay tuned in during commercials now that the commercial breaks are shorter. The real point of this campaign is to get people to tune back into their radio station quicker.
