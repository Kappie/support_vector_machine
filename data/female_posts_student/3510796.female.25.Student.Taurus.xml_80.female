Song of the day and Set Lists.  Another set list tonight.  I mailed out my cds and my b package today to get some more dmb shows.  The guy who is sending me the 7.9 show is hooking me up for free, but says he wants me to share someday.  I share all the time.  I cant even count how many cds Ive sent people-for free even.  So Im sending him a show and I just know that Im doing what he asked.  I will be sharing my 6.18 and 7.9 show with at least 3 people.  My brother said he doesnt want the 6.18 show, but he'll get it anyway.

Sports Report  Cubbies!  AH!  They are killing me.  Softly.  Still in second, but its not the prettiest of pictures.  Playing St. Louis this weekend.  We need to get under and sweep em up with a wooden broom!    Im going to the lake friday, that one big lake that keeps me from being a hop, skip and jump from the best damn city in the US.  Chicago, yes.  Chi town.  So yeah, Lake Michigan.  For the best burgers and some miniature golf.  Saturday is the wedding.  My parents good friends from the 70's, their daughter.  No question about the good time, and Im not going solo.  =)  Friday is also the big 4...er...4 for the monkeys.  If you dont know, dont fucking worry about it.  Why yes, if i was a swear word, that word would be fuck.    peace.love.dmb.
