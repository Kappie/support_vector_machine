The movie starts with TV psychic Criswell preparing us for what we are about to see: "You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable, that is why you are here...We're all interested in the future for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives." Clever words. And then the film starts with a funeral where mysterious things start to happen. The story was built around a few minutes of Bela Lugosi footage before he died. Bela Lugosi was a friend of the film's director Edward Wood Junior, and is famous for playing Dracula, Vampires and any other kind of evil. The rest of the film his character "The elderly man" was actually played by a chiropractor friend of the director, hiding his face with a cape...      The story is basically that the UFO's are coming to earth to destroy us humans before our scientists discover a bomb that will explode sunlight, and then use it to destroy the universe. They have been trying for a while, as they have now come as far as Plan number 9. Plan 9 is the resurrection of the dead. (In order to destroy humanity they manage to resurrect no less than 3 zombies...)             The "aliens" are dressed in satin suits and greet each other by crossing their arms. Night constantly changes till day and back again, the flying saucers made of paper plates. There are long silences, like the actors has forgot their lines, footage of military in tanks shooting (probably taken from the war) is used in between shots of "Kernel Edwards in charge of the saucer field activity". A long list of mistakes if you're interested:    urlLink PLAN 9 MISTAKES     ED WOOD WROTE THIS DIALOGUE...  Paula: "Saucers? You mean the kind from up there?"    Jeff: "Modern women. They have been like that through the ages."  The detective: "Inspector Clay is dead! Murdered! And someone's responsible!"   His excellency (the chief alien): "The earth people cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking around again, brought to life by our advancement in such things."  Jeff: "So what if we do develop this Solaranite bomb? We'd be even a stronger nation than now." Eros the Alien: "'Stronger.' You see? You see? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!"   In the end, the narrator comes out with this: "My friend. You have seen this incident, based on sworn testimony. Can you prove that it didn't happen? Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space. Many scientists believe we are being watched right now...We once laughed at the horse less carriage, the airplane, telephones, electrical light, vitamins, radio and even television. And now some of us laugh at outer space! God help us in the future.
