However, I still see people holding dollar bills in their mouths digging for change or trying to balance bags and wallets. Come to think about it, I think I see this at least once a day. Who knows how many I have missed that weren’t around me. You know you have done it at least once in your life. Lastnight I somehow got into real good thought about dirty money and realized that I really don’t think anything could be as dirty as money.  Money comes from a machine that probably is never cleaned, which makes it dirty from the time it’s made. It’s then put in the hands of people …. But think about HOW many people…. Maybe… oh… thousands…. Millions….. who knows? Just know that YOU aren’t the only one…. Most people are not always clean. People pick their nose, dig in their ears, and scratch their ass probably WHILE they are at home counting their money. I know you have seen on television (usually SEX scenes) where people are naked in a bed full of money. Well, there are some strange people in the world that will do this and probably HAVE done it with your money! With that said, there’s no telling what other weirdo’s have done with it. After all of this body fluid comes in contact with the money it gets even more love and affection from other sources. How many times have you dropped your change on the floor? *Dirty floor = dirty money!* How many times have you dropped your money on the floor and had to step on it to get it to stop spinning?.... *Dirty floor + dirty shoe= DIRTY MONEY!* How many times have you stepped in dog shit, smeared it into the grass, went about your business, many hours later dropped your change and had to step on it to make it stop spinning? *Dog shit + dirty shoe + dirty ground = Disgusting!* Ok, you get the point? After all of this, you STILL put the money in your mouth while balancing everything else you have to hold. Then, even later when you are with that special someone, you SHARE the goodness and kiss them with your shitty, dirty, money candy lips. What’s that about? No wonder people this day in age can’t stay in a relationship!   That’s it, I think I’ll put in a request for disposable money!
