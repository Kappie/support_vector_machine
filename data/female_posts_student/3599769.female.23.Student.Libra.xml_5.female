While these are only self diagnosed, by a future psychologist I feel the need to have an intervention with myself. I mean one minute sad, one happy, one hopeless, one full of life and hope, one suicidal, one loving life, one angry, one non-chalant. SOMEone save me from me. So while yesterday was day three of BOOTCAMP for the brokenhearted I've kept my word, one phone call per day. And I have successfully have not initiated an outing. But yesterday I did see him and had Starbucks. It was just like old times until the rain clouds rained on my silent parade. And like Gollum, I had one evil little me beside me telling me to tell him to leave him nice and good, he doesn't love you. And the calmer version of me saying Nope, I am not a quitter and this is what I CHOOSE to fight for. Until of course I wash my hands clean of him. Which I might never do. God, help me. I've been reading LUCKY by Alice Seebold, just finished actually I had read Lovely Bones and once I like an author I keep reading what they write. Lucky is a tragic story bringing me back to where my reality meets real reality. Telling myself to quit being selfish and realize that your problems are zilch in scale to those who have been victims of crime. Or those with real recognizable problems. So to everyone whose heart aches like mine and to those whose heartache I will never understand-a moment of silence.
