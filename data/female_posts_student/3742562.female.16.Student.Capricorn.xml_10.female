Today me  dad went shopping at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Best Buy, and Academy...I got me this new thing that holds videotaps  DVD's that matches my CD holder one...it's pretty neat...I got some new  urlLink shoes  and my  urlLink pants  for school...now I'm just waiting on a  urlLink schoolbag  and a  urlLink belt  and the other junk we need for that hell hole...  Dad's leaving for offshore tomorrow for a couple of months  I'm stuck here with Sass Mouth  Pissy Pants...oh boy, shouldn't this be  fun!  Today we got the tour of "hurricane season" from dad...and mom is  convinced  that everything isn't gonna work out so she's causing shit about that...she was saying "Ya'll are just kids, ya'll don't know everything..." ...so if we are too imcompetent to do that she can get her broken self and do it herself...idiot.   Since we have to drop Dad off at the New Orleans Airport we were going to go to the Museum of Art with my free passes, but N00o0o0...he got an earlier flight so now we can't go...Mom's like, we're gonna go...yeah right, if it was up to her, we'd never get there...grrr   And friends?  HAH ! What friends? I don't trust anyone...I don't talk to anyone from school really...I'm gonna be a LoNeR this year...the only person I talk to is my boyfriend Brandon, and thank  GOD  I have him...
