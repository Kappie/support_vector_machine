    
       
      When the sun stops shining and There's only me left, alone in the dark No one can see me cry, for there isn't any Love left for me From his heart for  Him and I to grow upon. It's always been known the ending will come, but only Time is what we had. For I will be forgotten, as he has given up on Me and the sun. All there is left To do is feel my heart Stop hurting inside and become numb.
