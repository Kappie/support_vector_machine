I wished sometimes I could just fade away into my darkness and just never come out. I am sorry your mom is disapponited in you. I am sorry for everything. Shanna I love you but I can see you in pain it kills me because I know it is because of me and I don't want to cause you pain or hurt you. I just wanted you to be happy. Being with me will cause you nothing but pain you seeing that now. It won't get better with time. You will be heartbroken because you father will not walk you down the aisle on your wedding day and I can't be the reason your heart gets broken. I just can't shanna.
