AND she came like 2 hours early to help me set up!! lol she totally solved my streamers problem [see blog below] and we even figured out how to get the balloons to go in between the garlands of paper.. :D attach ribbon to the neck of the balloon, and tape up the ribbon. ooh.. i know.  Ã¼bersmart .  my brother and dad helped to fill up water balloons.. and  gwen  was the next to arrive. then  sylvia . then we were watching  drumline , and  quoc ,  danna , and  tina  popped in together.  arla  and  sharu  came in, and we all waited like an hour for  jo  to come.. haha she got lost on the bus. scary thing.. i was in short shorts and a t-shirt because i had been setting stuff up on the deck, so i just jumped in the car with my dad to pick up jo from an intersection. and so i got out of the car and it must have seemed obvious i was looking for someone because this group of gino-looking guys were looking at me and this one guy goes "hey are you looking for me?" and im like "excuse me?" and he goes "every girl is looking for prince charming. i could be yours." what a creep! it was so  weird . :D at least i wasnt wearing my "looking for prince charming" shirt. :D speaking of that shirt.. we tried to get quoc to wear it but he wouldnt. :( boys.. such party poopers.  haha then im like "quoc youre a chicken!!" and he goes "no im not!" so i put my hand under my chin and go "chicken!!" and gwen goes "uh leanne.. thats a turkey." so i put my hand on top of my head, and she goes ".. thats rooster." haha then arla goes "hey this is monkey!" and does a monkey move.. and gwen goes "ooh this is elephant!!" :D and before you know it, there was a menagerie of exotic african elephants, giraffes, and the like in my own living room.  so after we picked up jo and everyone had changed, we had a mad water balloon fight. :( i forgot the watergun!! but it was great anyway. i had ONE SHOT at quoc.. and i nailed him. he was soaked. he threw like ten balloons at me.. and missed. haha im such a pro. so then back to my place for food..  i knew my mom always overestimated cooking. its like this: you want a lot more, you say you want a little more. you want a little more, you say you want no more. say you would like a lot more.. youre not going to see the next dawn. youll have died of asphyxiation as she force-fed you every edible thing on the planet. but good lord.. we had grilled chicken drumsticks, spring rolls, shrimp rings [my personal favorite], noodles.. everything. and drinks galore. :D i set up a sort of serve-yourself bar on a shelf on the porch. it was so romantic, almost.. we had one 3-tiered candle rack, and two floating candle vases.. and candles were just burning as we ate on the porch.. i dont know. i couldnt have asked for more. as i was sitting there, just listening to the jibber-jabber of happy people.. it hit me. i just felt how fortunate i am to have people i know care for me. just to have friends, and to be able to be in their company. its one of those things you never really consider.. but when you do,you realize how lucky you are. it must be a truly horrible thing, to be lonely.  then after all that eating, people requested a recovery interval before tackling cake, ice cream, and fruit platters. we were going to watch  hidalgo .. at least i wanted to. but then someone said "hey do you have any of those chinese movies?" and we had one on hand.. this chinese comedy called  teppenyaki .. its one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen, with the weirdest, most illogical plotline ever concieved by a chinese filmmaker. and thats saying a lot. essentially, the main character is married to the daughter of his boss, and is always caught flirting with people who come to the restaurant where he works. and one time he sees a calendar girl he has fallen in love with, and he challenges her date to a tennis match. he practices with a wok and onions. 100 onions per day, to be precise. he ends up winning the tennis match, using a wok. then he travels to the phillipines with girl.. and his grandfather, wife, best friend, and father-in-law. the rest is predictable, more or less. see what i mean? no plot whatsoever. but everyone loved it for some reason.. especially arla and gwen.. something about foreign films, i think they said.  then back to the porch for  career charades  and  things .. best games ever. :D so entertaining. then we did cake cutting, candle blowing, picture taking, the whole nine yards. then back inside for present opening. our numbers were decimated by half after present opening, since most people had to go home around 10-ish. the remaining horde went to the porch to play cards. it was kind of chilly, so we brought out my "watching movies" blankie to keep warm. it was so nice though.. the candles burning, wrapped up in a blankie, playing cards and talking. it was so funny because we were playing president, and the ass and vice ass had to do a dare decided by the president.. i had to do a romance scene with quoc.. something about him saving me in an alleyway. :D so lame.. lol there were so many kodak moments, but i was forbidden to use wilbur for documentation purposes.  ooh and we had fortune cookies. we did the immature thing of adding "in bed" to the end of each fortune. ill let you figure these ones out:     you display the wonderful traits of charm and courtesy.    you will be fortunate in everything you put your hands to.    now is the time to try something new.    you are kind-hearted and hospitable, cheerful and well-liked.    you love chinese food.    you constantly struggle for self improvement.    sing and rejoice, fortune is smiling on you.    you will travel far and wide for both pleasure and business.     of course, wilbur was by my side this whole time. i think i have almost a hundred pictures.. haha thats what i get for appointing danna as cameraperson. but its nice to have all of those pictures anyway. i just dont know how we could have taken that many.. amazing.  :D im happy.. lots happening this week. i have gwens party tomorrow!! cant wait for that. :D i have no idea how to get there, so im meeting quoc at his place, then were going to pick up tina and go there. then im going pubbing [yes, that is pubbing, not clubbing] with corina, jessica, and maria on friday.. were going to scour the pubs of toronto for hot british guys. well, just go to one and hope that well be able to find a few. :D might get lucky. then shopping, hopefully. urgh and work on wednesday and saturday.  im so sad.. because theres going to be a church get-together on the 29th.. like 50 people are going. and i have to go since i taught the youngest class of sunday school kids. haha not that that s a bad thing! keep reading. :D i want to see them all again.. we stopped classes in june and are resuming in september. theyre all such sweet kids.. and theyre so special to me. it helps put life in perspective, dealing with kids. like i asked them one time what they thought love was, how it was expressed. most of them said it was by if somebody hugged you and kissed you and such. but one of my kids, a little boy who was kind of reclusive, said "love is knowing somebody cares when they look at you. you can see their eyes. like when my mom tucks me in. i look at her eyes and i can tell." it was just those simple words that put my entire life back into perspecive. i need those kids in my life the same way they treat me as a mentor and teacher. children are the best teachers, sometimes. :D and i think some of the altar boys are coming.. so itll be good to see them all again.  whoa.. i totally strayed there. so anyway.. the 29th is also the same day as the annual party my supervisor throws at her place for pages.. and its doubling as a going-away party for arla. :( but now.. i have a clash. i hate when that happens. i will have to work things out.  i will be uploading pictures on a msn groups page sometime.. ill give the link when i get it done. but over 100 pics.. that could take awhile.  - L.
