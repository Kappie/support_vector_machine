    
       
       No Title   In the shadows I’ll remain Beneath all this pain  Chaos above  Bitter tears fall down Burning the ground  Loneliness my friend Until the end  Bend with the night Quitting the fight  Sweet angel’s voice Give me the choice  To remain alive Or to say: “-Forever Goodbye”  |Diamanda|
