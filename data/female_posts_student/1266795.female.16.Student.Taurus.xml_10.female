Daniel and I helped Layman out during SRT, carrying books, running papers to students, etc. It wasn't until then that I realized that I would never be in any of my green day classes again, excepting North Star SRT. It's so sad!! I'm getting all sentimental here! Argh... I don't adapt well to change.   Things I'll Miss This Summer: - Snack Shop (haha) - N* staffers sneaking out to buy us food - Kelsey's outfits - Kaylan and me feeling smart in Algebra II :P (Slack-off juniors!) - World History - Ammar getting yelled at by the other guys, him yelling back; Courtney's hugs (haha); Daniel just being Daniel; the Millenium Series theme song - French *tear* - Christmas potato! (Evan will only be with us another year!) - All of N* stuff - Jonah *illegally* playing games on the school computer - Jonah losing badly when I sit and watch (haha!) - orchestra periods that weren't really orchestra periods (mostly this past month, when I left orchestra to work on "N* stuff")  I have no good memories of chem, so I'll stop there. :P  You know, Jane, posting more often would make us all happier and would lighten the load of entries you have to read. (hint, hint)  I GOTS EARS!
