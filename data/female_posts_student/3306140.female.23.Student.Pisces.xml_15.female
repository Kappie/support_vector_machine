That is the way it went for the better part of the weekend. Then Sunday, the day of rest, came and all hell broke lose. I started out by doing Dwight hair. That took five damn hours. Then we went to his house so we could get him some cloths. Here it come the I am going to scream if I didn't do something more part. We went back to my house and low and behold we were bored again. This getting to be a pain in the butt. So I snapped, I got a attitude that you would not believe. I did not want to talk to anyone or see anyone for the whole night. It was one in the morning before I talk to Dwight again. See I am special; I know I need help.
