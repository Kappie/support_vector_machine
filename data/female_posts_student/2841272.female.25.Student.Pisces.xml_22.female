I don’t want this to be dialog mistaking the word ‘overrated’ with ‘sucks’.  I’m approaching this topic by calibrating the general consensus of the director/actor/writer with the talent level I grade them.  Essentially my argument boils down to points, some I feel have a few unearned points in their column, others deserve a few extra.  With that out of the way here are my candidates.  Mood is an aspect of filmmaking I have great reverence for.  Mood adds a great deal to the story and the characters and yet rarely gets its due.  One of the masters (perhaps the master of mood) is David Fincher.  My theory of David Fincher is this- critics comment on the story he’s telling but not the film he’s made.  Perhaps the biggest lapse in critical judgment of the previous century was the blithe dismissal of Fincher’s best work  Fight Club  (with the exception of Peter Travers) because critics were uncomfortable with what the film had to say, though I think they also missed a great deal of the films point.  Fincher has proven to be a remarkably consistent director, a quality my wallet and I adore.  After getting his feet wet with the third  Alien  film he found his style with  Se7en ,  The Game ,  Fight Club  and  Panic Room .  His films look and feel like no other.  Fincher, I suspect, hasn’t received the real credit he deserves because his films tend to illustrate the confusion, darkness and hopelessness we all feel, but his talent and command make him the most underrated director in Hollywood.  The other maestro of mood is Gore Verbinski.  Verbinski doesn’t have Finchers knack for bringing all the elements together, but his visual style is one of the best in Hollywood.  The  Mexican, The Ring  and  Pirates of the Caribbean  are all films worth watching without sound.  His best film,  Pirates , sailed on the witty dialog and Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Kiera Knightley’s entertaining performance.  With time and experience if he learned to keep up he could become a director worth reckoning with.  Comedy seems to be the hardest and most unappreciated genre in movies, which is why we have so few great comedies.  One of the best directors around is Cameron Crowe, who’s light touch blends films that are as funny as they are touching.  Crowe knows how to handle a younger cast and as a writer and director puts more humanity and truthfulness into his characters than almost anyone around.  Two other unsung heroes in the romantic comedy game are Andrew Bergman and Andy Tennant.  Bergman directed two forgotten gems,  Honeymoon in Vegas  and the funniest movie to flop that should have been a hit,  The Freshman .  Tennant helmed two of the better romantic comedies,  Ever After  and  Sweet Home Alabama , empowering the female leads to give their best performances in this category of films.  Neither Bergman or Tennant is a great director, which Crowe is closing in on, but they are both succeeding in a territory where most are failing.  My final underrated mention is Mike Nichols, a man who appears on the list of best directors but is, in my opinion much closer to the top.  Nichols has an unparalleled versatility, as his credits range from the cerebral  Carnal Knowledge  to the campy  Birdcage .  Nichols has the rare gift of making films that define the times and yet preserve an element of timelessness.  In  Primary Colors  he not only summed up the 90’s political mood, he spoke to the larger on going question of integrity and compromise, whether ends justify the means or if the means are the end themselves.  Recently Nichols has downsized his work to HBO, a shame for the larger movie audience, but his ability remains as large as ever.  My first four overrated directors fall into an over hyped category.  They’re all good directors but particularly their recent films have failed to live up to the wonder the chorus was singing.  Lasse Hallstrom hasn’t made a movie that genuinely touched me since  What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?   Peter Jackson’s  Lord of the Rings  trilogy was impressive but failed to live up to its operatic ambitions and lost steam as it went along.  For me the series had as many holes as it did Oscars.  I hope that this years Alexander the Great film will return Oliver Stone to his glory since he peaked with  JFK .  Finally and I hope I’m not stoned for saying this but I think Steven Speilberg is overrated.   Schindlers List  is an unassailable masterpiece but since then Speilberg has been reading too much of his own press.  The most glaring example is  Saving Private Ryan , a shamelessly manipulative piece of patriotic, nostalgic propaganda.  To understand the true fear, pointlessness and stark realities of war turn to Terrance Malick’s superior WWII drama  A Thin Red Line .  I prefaced this post by saying I didn’t want overrated confused with sucks, (and I don’t) but I forget to preface my preface by stating there is one exception- Brett Ratner.  I don’t think Hollywood thinks Ratner is a world class director, if they do it’s the end of the world as we know it, but they did give him sixty million dollars and Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson.  Hollywood doesn’t hand over that kind of money and talent to a hack, except in this case they did because Ratner is a hack.  And not a good hack like Ed Wood, but a complete and total hack who should never be allowed to film any actors outside Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.  I look forward to your reply.
