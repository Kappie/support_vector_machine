Here's the story: i got a little taste of prom day early as i had to get my hair all done pretty and get a manicure and pedicure. the asian ladies at the salon were hilarious. they thought i was awesome because i love asian stuff too! anyways, alright Vivian looked beautiful and glowing of course and Brad was really funny as always. The wedding was beautiful as was the church and it was a short service thing. So when everyone was clearing out to send the bride and groom onto reception (in a party bus!)with bubbles and all, i saw this really cute guy who had longish light brown hair and green eyes. I decided that he would be the one i would pick up tonight. Haha, well that didn't happen because of something else. We go to the wedding and we ate blah blah blah.....and then they started playing "Hey Ya" and i decided to go dance. I met this guy named Connor, a guy who had just graduated from high school and was going to SMU. He lives in Coppell but he went to Cistercian high school. Anyways, we danced and hung out the entire night with some other people like Emily, Brad's sister, and Scott, this kid from Jesuit. So i gave him my phone numbers and he said he'd call me ASAP so we could hang out. He's sooo nice. He got my drinks and everything! And get this, this is the weirdest part of the night! I went out there for the bouquet toss and caught the bouquet!!! But then Connor went out there for the garter toss and he CAUGHT the garter!!!! Haha, after that both our parents were acting like we were both getting married. So that was pretty cool. And because it was a wedding, my parents let me drink alcoholic beverages that night. I had 2 wine spritzers, 1 and 1/2 bottles of Corona with lime (Connor got me those), 1 glass of champagne, half a glass of wine and half a bottle of bud light. Oh yes and a few sips of Vodka-tonic. That definitley surpasses my last alcohol count lol. I was a little off balance, but so were my parents so it was ok. Anyways, i wasn't nearly as wasted or even close to it as some of the other people at that wedding. Brad, the groom, was stone drunk and Vivian was tipsy. And this one guy was so drunk, he went up on stage and sang "I Believe I Can Fly" at the top of his lungs lol. That was the funniest thing i had seen in a long time. Then this other guy went up there and tried to make a speech, but i dunno what he was saying, he was too drunk. The bridesmaids were all drunk too, including Amanda and Brad's sister who is 15, Emily. I would just like to say that i drank pretty responsibly unlike other people. So pretty much everyone at reception was drunk except the flower girl and ring boy. It was very amusing though. So anyways, to get more to the point, i made the hook-up at my friend's wedding, in Carol's words, so i guess thats good.   This morning i went to church and told everyone what happened at the wedding and Carol was so excited that she kissed me on both cheeks and told me that i could borrow her clothes etc etc and everyone said i had to give the whole story after the date. Then after church, we went to celebrate my brother, Garik's, birthday.   And here we are.   There's a Camp Memories party tonight that i'm going to, that should be fun.   Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
