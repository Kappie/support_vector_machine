Ps27:5  Lord, you say tat in times of trial O'Lord You'd hide me from the evils of this world. Father I pray that you do it now O'Lord The cruelty of this world is becoming too much to bear. Take it O'Lord, take it. I lift up all my burdens, all my fears, all my worries. I lift them up unto you right now Father. I give them all to you Lord. Guide me Lord, protect me and lead me as only you can. I need you Father. Be with me always, I pray.  Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord! Ps27:14  The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him. Ps28:7  Truly Lord, you are my strength, my portion and my shield, You gave me strength to carry on, to pull through all of my days.  The Lord will give strength to His people; The Lord will bless His people with peace. Ps29:11  dearest kym, Lets brave through this together, There are many more tomorrows waiting for us to conquer. Let us not be stuck in this phase of our life for too long, They are but passing clouds in our lives. And this I promise you, that after the storm will come the sunshine. -Ade-
