Well I think Of Mice and Men has mentally impaired me, because for some reason I can't stop thinking about it and I was reading it this morning (we have a copy at home) and I started crying! I'm so sad. Anyway... Yes! Enter our blog! Not that we'll get a mention, but do it all the same! Now that REALLY would be funny!   Getting annoyed with all thesse "Answer the questions and send it on to everyone you know!" thingies, so I'm thinking about making my own, but with loadso of really dumb questions like - "Which is better - The Moon, or Uranus?" or "What's your favourite mode of transport - Space-hopper or Magic Carpet?" . Cause all the ones that go round have pretty much the same questions like - "Who's your favourtie movie star?" and "What's your favourtie food?" I mean, come on - be a little inventive, guys!
