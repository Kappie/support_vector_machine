See I was waiting for Graham to call me to tell me if I was gonna go with them to Ottawa.   My Mom waited for a while and then said sorry Ness we gotta go to London, sure you don't want to come along? And stupid me said nope, he's going to call me soon, and I'll probably be able to go. So I waited from 9am ( I got up early so I didn't miss his call) until 6pm. Yah thats right I kept everyone off the line that long! Do you know how crazy that is for my family?! So then I thought, well Chris should be home by now, and he said he'd call after work. So I just said screw it, and called him. He said that he talked to Graham, and I couldn't go, but Graham said that he tried to call but couldn't get through. Even though I'd been off the line all day. And I'd *69 every hour to see the last number that called my house, and everytime it was my grandma's number when she'd called in the morning to say bye to my Mom.   That I was okay with, whatever doesn't matter, I guess I missed going to London. But I was pissed...not that Graham didn't call me, I don't know who I was mad at...just generally mad. I could never be mad at Graham...he's awesome. Not only did I miss London, but I was just frustrated with the fact that I sat around all day, not going out or doing anything afraid that I'd miss his call.  Now I've had sometime to think about it and I guess that would've been hard for Graham to call me and tell me I couldn't go with them. I'd have a hard time with that...it's kind of mean. But now I know that it's better to be mean...  I don't even know why I'm mad...this is not only stupid...it's pointless..and a waste of time.
