And i might go pick up yasmine for our week of funn. Hopefully she can come today, if not some other day. emm, i cleared things up with nick and all is well. he mentioned his past relationships were haunting him, whatever that means. but i'm sure he will be fine. i truley do care for him. he's been on my mind so much latley.                         i think i was completly under the in fluence of something bad, because i woke up this morning and fire was buring in the pit outside and my sister told me i had lite it yesterday night like around 2 while keily was here and we were just sitting around the pit laughing about nothing. oh well, another memory i can't remember.                                              Laterz
