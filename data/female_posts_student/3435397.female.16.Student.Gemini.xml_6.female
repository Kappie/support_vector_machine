I love how when life just gets going great you are getting over the fact that you have lost almost 6 people in under 2 years and then no one dies or disappears for so long like I don't know almost a year I think.  Then a good friend of yours his grandma dies when you are away on a trip and you come back to find out your great aunt who you JUST VISITED over Easter who was perfectly fine happy and loving like all aunts now she probably couldn't tell you from a pet dog who has died.  One more person gone and I loved her so much.  I didn't really know her but I still love her so much!  My cousins Jessica and Teresa I know you guys probably wont see this but just to let you guys know I love you so much and if my mom would let me come with her to visit you I would be there and I would help you get through this because my grandma was like this too and I know the feeling and I really really miss you guys! I love you so much and never for get it!     Okay so I should stop before I have people feeling sorry for me PLEASE DON'T!!!! This is my way of getting everything out and I don't want any I feel sorry for you comments its not me so please please don't! alrite?!      Hey you guys who got positions on SRC I love ya and good job.  For my friend who didn't no matter what I still love you! You're just to good for them lol!  Rhiannon I have a few good ideas too...We have to talk!;)      I have become a book worm thanks to RHIANNON WARD!!!! GRRRR You lol jk.
