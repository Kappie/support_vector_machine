Heat wave! >_> But of course, with summer comes the end of school! :D And the beginning of review classes for the college entrance tests. =/ I won't be taking the review classes. One reason would be because we're visiting my brother in Virginia this summer. He's already been there for over six months, so I'm actually looking forward to seeing him again.  Hmm, not much has been happening lately. Nothing of much interest. Just school work and projects. *sigh*  PS>> Taira, my dear childer on the Vampire Site (whoever you are...) just e-mail me for my YM id. :P
