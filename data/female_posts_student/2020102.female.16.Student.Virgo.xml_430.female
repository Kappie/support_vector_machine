One of them was always getting stuck under the tractor, and Lassie was always rushing back to the farmhouse to alert the other ones. She'd whimper and tug at their sleeves, and they'd always waste precious time saying things: 'Do you think something's  wrong?  Do you think she wants us to  follow  her? What  is  it, girl?' as if this had never happened before, instead of every week. What with all the time these people spent pinned under the tractor, I don't see how they managed to grow any crops whatsoever. They probably got by on federal crop supports, which Lassie filed the applications for." -Dave Barry, "Earing a Collie Degree"
