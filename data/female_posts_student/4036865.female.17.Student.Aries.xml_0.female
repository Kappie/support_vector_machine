Lets see, its 2:32 and i am still awake. i've been laying in bed for two hours, trying to sleep, with no luck. i'm supossed to go to dinner this evening, but right now, i just can't get any rest, i won't be able to. i am out of medicine, i'm now out on my last limb, i would do anything for a a pain killer right now, just anything to make it bearable. Even typing this is difficult, but i need someone to talk to, keep my mind off all this. It's been a pretty good day today, fairly relaxed, slept a little, still tired, but sleep will come, i am sure. My older brother's friend is still over, him and my two brothers, and Kyle stay up playing video games until god know's when, that also makes it hard to sleep. i just toss and turn. Restless. i'm listening to Finger 11 right now, usually music soothes me and makes me finally fall asleep, but even that doesn't help. i'm gonna go, give it another shot. Night.
