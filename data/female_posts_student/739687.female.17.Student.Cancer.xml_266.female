Have you ever just felt like there's not a place for you with anyone or anything? It's like you've kinda ruined your invitation with pretty much everyone you know. For once, I'm actually feeling a sense of regret. I wish I could just go back in time and change  everything.  I feel like I've messed everything up. I've lost so many great friendships because I've been  stupid  and foolish in a million ways. I've ruined my life all in my attempts to make it better. All because my perception of "better" was something so far from reality. I just wanted to be different and have a life that's a little more exciting than everyone else's. And through that, I've created a life  exactly  like everyone else's. Somewhere in the last year, I lost hope in good things.  And I don't want pity or sympathy or anything, because I'm more apt to run away from that. I'm the only person who can help myself, and I don't want nor need anyone else. I just want to belong somewhere. I'm a drifter, and I'm drifting alone.  Find hope in good things, crazies.
