Aretha Franklin singing a milk commercial on the radio! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? Has she squandered all her money? She is not the Backstreet Boys, she is not supposed to be doing such commercials... WHATEVER! [ Mon Sep 16, 01:37:39 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] What am I listening to???   Today I am in a very mellow mood so I have chosen the soft dulce tones.... no I am just kidding... I am in a mellow mood so I am listening to Norah Jones. Go check her out. She has got an amazing voice. I saw her open for Dave Matthews once. She's got a low sultry voice that can sing a soft jazz song like no one else. If you don't check her out you'll have no idea what you are missing.

I see the cardiologist on the 24th, I do the sleep study on Oct. 3rd, and I am in the midst of trying to set up a nuerology appt. Sound like fun to you?
