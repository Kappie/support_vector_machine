("Not Coming Home," Maroon 5)   I am listening to some Maroon 5 and trying to chill.  "Chillaxing," as Luke Morgan says.  My teeth are chattering like usual.  Ok, I got probably one hour out of all the waking hours put into  The Castle of Otranto .  I was going to finish it today...Arrrggg..  Instead, I watched one hour of Full House and had a blast from the past, looked at delicious boys with Case online for at least an hour and a half, hung out with my RA, played with fabrics, and I don't really remember what else.  But now I'm tired.  I really like that Martina McBride song "This One's for the Girls."  Whenever she gets to the part that says, "This is for all you girls about twenty-five...," I lift up my hand like you do at a frat party when you're holding a beer and somebody's singing your favorite song.  :D  If I'm in my car, I bang on the roof...  But instead of "living in little apartments just trying to survive... on dreams and spagetti-ohs," I am living in a little dorm room on Slim Fast bars, omelets, and popsicles.  For anyone who's expecting this blog to be some great literary art, wipe that ridiculous idea from your mind.  Yes, I'm an English major, but this is just a random collection of rambling thoughts from me and my not-so-amazing life.  That doesn't mean I don't think it's amazing.  But I can see the magic in the little things. Ok, pretty soon I have to go to bed.  Because I want to get up at a reasonable time tomorrow so I don't feel like I'm wasting the whole day.  Grrrrrrr... I hate when that happens...  Mama and Daddy invited me to come home any time during the break if I wanted to.  I just might take them up on that because it's so hecka boring and lonely up here.  I really get down when there is no one to talk to or hang out with or hug.  :(  Michelle said, "You're an extrovert.  You derive your energy from being with other people."  True true. Well, I wanted to put a link on my blog to this site, but I was feeling extra techie-incompetent today while staring at user interface for blog templates.  BLEH.  So, here is the website (Thank you, Brian Holland; you made my day!!!!!!!):  urlLink http://www.candyboots.com/wwcards.html   urlLink
