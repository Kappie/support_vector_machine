The only thing that has sucked lately is that we lost an hour because of the gay time changing crap. But besides that, things have been....*and I say this hesitantly, for fear of jinxing myself yet again*...good. Things have been...quite good.   There's no purpose in hate. Where will it get you to hate the things you can't change? And if you  can  change them, what's stopped you thus far?   Hmm...I really can't think of much to say. Not much has been going on though, so it's understandable.  See you crazies later.
