I should probably put my shirt back on (it's an habit of mine, to walk around the house shirtless). Or turn off the fan.  Biology exam went okay - boring short answers questions. And no, I didn't study. I won't study for tomorrow's French exam either (...well, I should remember the play and book we read. Oh, grammar be damned. We're allowed a dictionary anyway... -_- ) Anyway, tonight I have horseback riding, so I'll be gone from 5:00-9:00. I'm going to accept their summer camp job proposal. I'm happy. ^^ I have to practice my circles. :P Even though I'd rather do jumping. Talking of horses, I didn't mention that I got one for my birthday (December 24th) two years ago, uh? His name's Shadow, two years-old gelding (Appaloosa/Quarter Horse mix). I wuv him loads even though I don't see him often since he lives in Quebec (see, my parents divorced and I was supposed to move with my dad but decided against it). He's beautiful - I'll try scanning a picture later if I can (...see the post about cutting my head off - my computer crashed and stuff).  I had a nice msn talk with Ricky last night - he was the one who made me take the test below this entry - and we're supposed to chat again tonight. It makes me happy... I need happiness. And glomps. Gimme glomps! And lollipops...
