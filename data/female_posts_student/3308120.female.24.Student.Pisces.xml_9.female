This specific university has a student body of about 600, with only one computer lab of 30 computers, and no internet connection.  Students have to travel 18 miles away to use a cyber cafe.  Yet, these people are determined to get educated in the modern world technology, with goals of graduating with computer science and mathematics degrees.  Their enthusiasm for learning does not hold them back while the rest of the world sits back and surfs the web.  I think this is a prime example that with a little hard work and dedication, anyone can succeed at their goals.
