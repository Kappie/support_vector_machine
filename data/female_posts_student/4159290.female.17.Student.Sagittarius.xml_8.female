I literally just spent the last two days in my bed playing on the computer all day.  Didn't feel up to much else.  Well, I did talk to David a few different times for awhile.   (For those of you I haven't already told, David is this really awesome, incredibly sweet, nearly perfect guy I met online that lives in Cape Coral (a city right next to Fort Myers.))  But that's about all I did.  Maybe I'll be better tomorrow... but there's not much else to do, so I  guess I'll just play on the computer in the living room instead of my bedroom, lol.  Cindy got me a new digital camera a few days ago for my high ACT/AP scores.  (ACT, 32 - Calculus BC, 5 - Microeconomics, 4 - Physics B, 3)  I was totally shocked, cuz Daddy already let me spend like $100 online buying stuff to celebrate.  (btw, I  still have $26.19 left.  Post a comment if you know what I should get.)  It was really funny tho, cuz he was like "Shanna, come here.  Sit down, I wanna talk to you."  And I was like "omg.. omg.. omg..  I'm in trouble."  I thought he was gonna like yell at me for giving David my number or something.  But it was all good.  It's a nice camera too.   urlLink Canon A300 .  3.2 megapixels, 5.1x zoom.  I'm happy.
