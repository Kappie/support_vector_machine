I need a job with people who have a bit more professionalism than this shitty after school fry-fest provides.  Drama is for outside work. That's what I hate about my job. Gay gay gay gay gay  SO...yep.  I'm a pretty cool, exciting person.  Working is not fun. But I have to work tomorrow. From 8 to 4. Please visit me. Please rescue me.  Ahh I can't even focus I'm so tired. Good sign that sleep is near.  Goodnight crazies.
