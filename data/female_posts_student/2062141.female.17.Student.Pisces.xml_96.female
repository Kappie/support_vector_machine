I finally came to the conclusion that I have to get out of Altman's class, I can't work so hard for a D, and try to conform to her teaching method that is the opposite of what I need. It sucks because I know I'm a good writer, and I understand her lectures and whatnot, but the impersonal teaching, the impossible anal-retentive tests, and her absolute refusal to help me at all (what does she have against me?) when I really need it, especially after missing two weeks last month. So yesterday I pretty much had a panic attack trying to finish that god-awful just-got-the-prompt-write-in-one-hour-in-pen-no-mistakes essay. I had a really good 3 paragraphs, but surprise i need 5. Even though my 3 are probably better than someone's 5 who wrote it in 2/3 the time. It won't matter to Mrs Altman because she's all about the technicality and her requirements. I'm out of that class. I'm done. I think an A in a regular class is better than a D in an honors class. So yeah yesterday sucked. Until I took a bath (which is weird cause I never have baths), while I listened to the JMraz live cd, then I watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and Charlotte called. (Thanks BeanDip! lol :D ) So, like my usual self, I just came to the conclusion that everything will work out and be okay.
