Is this really something we can teach?  We can't teach political activism, can we (political awareness, yes, but not activism)?  Or does someone have to want to blog to be able to learn?    This all sounds very metaphysical (How many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? One, but the lightbulb has to  want  to change.), but I think you see my point.
