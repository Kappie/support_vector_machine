SOME OF US have homework, projects, chores, priorities, CRAP we have to do before we can even sleep. same old same old in life. honestly i am starting to feel the same way. why do i always start the school year finishing something. not finishing. but just getting through something so that now i have nothing. nothing keeping me going. i dont have that sence of promise and potential. instead i have the feeling of closure and nothingness. Nothing. ...school and alanah are keeping me going. school b.c. its my life. and alanah b.c. my life depends on her. lol no, but i am very closed off lately and i dont want to open up to all these ppl, and be social and bubbly to ppl i dont know. even some ppl i do know, i just dont feel like opening up to them, and i think they are feeling the same way, so ya know. its a vicious circle.  but i feel so detached from every i'm mostly around recently. i can't relate to anyone around me. i look around and i dont see anyone. People talk to me about their problems and i know EXACTLY how they feel and what they are going through, but it makes me feel wierd.  FIRST OF ALL CAN I JUST SAY: i have a fucking CONCEIDED outlook on it most of the time and i just want to slap myself.  like i hear about who someone likes, all their crush secrets, and i KNOW how they feel, but it seems childish, and i know it means the world to them, i've been there! but it seems inconsequential in the big serious picture. in two months soemthing could happen and their life will be completely changed and nothing of this will matter...i'm so hypocritic b.c. i'm obsessive over little things but, i'm stupid and horribly mean. no wonder no one opens up to me, ive ruined my ...chance w. them? i dont knwo.  see, i'm so fucking conceided and...arogant. thats it -arogant. i can;t help it. i'll shut up now b.c. i'm just "bringing out the savage" in me. and sounding like the worst person in the world. which i probably am if ppl knew my thoughts. i dont mean to be so fucked up. sigh i need to expand myself. i actually am really close off. i dont know if thats a bad thing. maybe. probably. its unhealthy the outlook i have on life. i mean i'm happy. really very happy. free. stressed but not opressed. i am just  incomplete. i liek to think i'm complete and have everything. but i feel unfinished. i know the reason. but that subject is dead. i've over talked my share on it. i've stopped right? just tell me to shut up...like now...im ranballing, frustrating mysefl b.c.i can't finish any of my thoughts b.c. i dont even know what i'm exactly saying. something that i thought about when alyssa talked about it. i might say that i'm bored -lately i've been not useing that tho b.c.i really never am, i am so easily amused. and content w. the world. i can be sitting there for an hour doing nothing. not talking to anyone. and i'm perfectly happy. when you have to talk to someone you dont particularly want to, or doing sometihng that you dont want to, it takes to much out of you, its not boring. it becomes tedious. but i can sit there and be fine. someone i'm sitting w. might htink i'm boring but just watching ppl amuses me for hours. i'm weird i KNOW. very strange. but still, i'm easily amused and content, this was all spauned by alyssa's email, haha blame her for my CONTINUED RAMBOLING i'm shutting up now!!!!!!! sorry!!!!!!!
