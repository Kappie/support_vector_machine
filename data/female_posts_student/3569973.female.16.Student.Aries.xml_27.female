Well that didnt really bother me because I needed to clean the house anyways because I hadnt this week, but ya know. So I cleaned and got ready to go with my mom when she got home so that we could go back to school shopping. We were out until about 3:30 when I came home and got ready to go out with Jessica and Brandy. We ended up going to see Little Black Book and ran into Clayton. So while we were out in the parking lot we decided to go ahead and decorate his car with window chalk. Then we headed to wal-mart to get some more window chalk because we were all out. While we were there we ended up turning a few heads...lol...I mean come on 3 girls in mini skirts at 10:00pm in the car parts section. We had some weirdo guys follow us when we were leaving and then some guys yell at us in the parking lot in there car. Then we went back up to the movies to see if there was anyone else there that we knew so that we could write on their car. Well there was no one really, it was pretty dull for a friday night, so went went to Burger King to eat and I think the people there got tired of us, but it doesnt matter because we one some free food. Its soo much fun hanging out with them, because for the most part I just cant stop laughing. On the way home we had to stop and have a little Fire Drill, because of technical problems...lol. So tomorrow I gotta get up early and then head out to arlington with the parents to go shopping again, and hopefully Ill get my sandals. Till then, Later Days
