Stupid running around putting chairs everywhere >_   Among other things, I've  totally  redone my desktop and it looks sooo damn cool. I have the most awesome wallpaper  ever . Muahaha, I feel special. Unfortunately, this also means that my darling sister is going to kick me off the internet (yes, we share a line, and yes, it sucks, because suddenly she's decided to be a little social butterfly through MSN..) in about ten minutes.   I am drinking three-days-old coke. Now what does that say of me??   C (meaning Chris for now heh), if you've ever checked my blog past that one time you called me a gangsta (I mean what the fuck???) on my tagboard, you have to tell me what movie we're all going to see. Personally, I'd much rather we all just crashed at your house and rented, because my feet hurt and couches are better than movie seats, but whatever. My vote is for From Hell and Resident Evil. Because Johnny Depp is in From Hell and he is damn sexy, and B wants to see Resident Evil for some (blonde) (ditsy) reason =D   She's going to smack me tomorrow.   And who else is going? I say we invite e v e r y b o d y. That will fit in your living room/family room/whichever room's got a T.V. and either a VCR or a DVD player. Just because it's fun with people :) If you can't have too many people in your house, we should all go to Boston Pizza and then go to a movie! Yay! *is lame* lol. Ciao, everyone.
