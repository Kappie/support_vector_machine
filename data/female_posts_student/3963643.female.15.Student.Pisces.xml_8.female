My grandpas cancer is gone!    right now-- I'm at the point where if something bad could happen then it will. Everyone has those times but its different for everyone... ugh it stinks! but its the kinda thing that if you worry about it too much things will just get worse, but if you dont worry about it then you feel guilty because the other person will think your not concerned?? im so confused! and im sorry if im being mean or if i seem cranky for the next few days and if you have anything that you need help with just ask ill try to help the best I can! sorry and thanks again-tami
