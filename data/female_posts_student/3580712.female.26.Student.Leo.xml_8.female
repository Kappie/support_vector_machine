Fellowship is happy to announce that one of our members took an interest in helping out and taking on the responsibility of organizing our calendar and events. Our new Events Coordinator is (drum roll please....) Wildo Ballenilla. Thank you Wildo. For those who had an interest or thought about the position, it does not mean that you can not share your ideas with us. Just let Fellowship know what you would like to see in the future and we and our Event Coordinator will put something together for all to enjoy. God Bless you!!   P.S. The Lord takes care of his people!
