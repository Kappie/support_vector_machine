But that's not my lifestyle - it's a philosophy. Punk rock is about having no rules. By saying that you can't have conservative political beliefs (or any politicial belief for that matter)and be a punk is like saying you have to think a certain way in order to BE a punk. And that is bullshit.  However, just because I lean towards the right on some issues, does not by any means suggest that I am a Bush supporter. I am not.   George W. claims that god talks to him and commands him. Not only does that sound completely dumb to me, but it also horrifies me. I don't care who you are, every person who has claimed that god speaks to them, turns out to be INSANE. For some reason god always wants people to kill in his name. the Iraq war is a great example of Bush doing just that. Having the religious right in charge of people's lives scares me to the very bone.  Bush is going to appoint two new supreme court justices who will remain there for life, and they are going to try to overturn Roe Vs Wade, the draft and so on and so forth.  Unfortunately, this is not the election to vote for personal desires. I am a registered independent, but I can't vote for Nader. Not that I want to vote for Kerry either. The pickings suck. At this point, I just feel that Bush needs to be removed from office so damage control can begin.  There are a lot of people who think that when you speak out against George Bush that you're not a patriot. But the thing is, I love this country, and that is why I feel the need to say something about what is going on. I love America, and I'm so glad I live here â€¦ it's just a shame that the rest of the world thinks of us a hillbillies.  I know this was very generalized, and I have a lot more to say on a lot of topics, but unfortunately, I have limited time. So, therefore, I will get to it a little later
