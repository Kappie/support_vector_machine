Yes, it was an attempt at getting laughs, I laughed anyway..o.o;;       So moving on, I'm currently talking to Nick and Ashes and Michael. It makes me happy to talk to my friends hehe. I guess that would make sense...otherwise why would I bother talking to them right? heh...      Hehe, Nick ish so cute. I just wanna coddle him sometimes. He's all ador-ed about everything he says. He could insult me and I'd think he was so cute about it...funny how that works. We play minesweeper flags currently..and I lose miserably. And now I am defeated at Tic-tac-toe..I wonder how they came up with that name..Is it like one-two-three in some weird language? That would make sense..wouldn't it? I think it would. Hmm...maybe I'll ask someone else later..*ponders*      Michael is getting so annoying; I wish he'd be normal and stop being all gushy. Can't we just have a decent conversation? Please?! For cripes sake. AND WHO IS CRIPE?! Good lord. *rambles on to self*      Soo...now that I'm off that subject. *gasp* I haven't said anything to Ashes for like ten minutes! Unheard of. Oooh she made someone feel her wrath. Personally I fear her wrath, she is rather scary when she's irritated or angry. But otherwise she's the most amusing person I know..and she understands why I randomly laugh. Isn't that great; I'm not insane by myself, I'll never get lonely. Even when everyone else starts ignoring me because I'm just too weird for them. HAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough*      I babble. I'm a babbler. I go on and on and on; about absolutely nothing. And I have fun doing it. I amuse myself more then anyone else could even attempt to. I'll see something and that will trigger a thought and then all of a sudden I'm on the floor laughing. I laugh so much it hurts, and I laugh a lot. Laughing is fun for me, its my source of happiness. If I didn't laugh at least once in the day I think it could be potentially harmful. I could die, or something not so dramatic.       O.o Yes, I'm morbid. Mwahahahahahahahahahaha. *cackles and coughs*
