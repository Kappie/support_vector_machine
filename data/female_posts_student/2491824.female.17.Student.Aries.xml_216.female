October was the last time that I was in DC just to do nothing... *sigh*  ..Once I get my license I'll be down there all the time...   I know that we are going to the  urlLink WW2 Memorial . I'm thinking that I want to go to an  urlLink art gallery  (I'm not sure if mom would really enjoy that though) or maybe catch an  urlLink IMAX movie  or something.  Wheee... :)
