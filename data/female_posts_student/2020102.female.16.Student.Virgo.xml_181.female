I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it. I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy. I want to know if you can see beauty, even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, 'Yes!' It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments." - Oriah Mountain Dreamer  "Why does the Air Force need expensive new bombers? Have the people we've been bombing over the years been complaining?" - George Wallace  "If you can't beat your computer at chess, try kickboxing." - Anonymous  "What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books." - Sigmund Freud  "Now, once again, we find ourselves facing rising gas prices, and the question is: This time, are we going to learn from the past? Are we finally going to get serious about energy conservation? Of course not! We have the brains of mealworms! So we need to get more oil somehow. As far as I can figure, there's only one practical way to do this. That's right: We need to clone more dinosaurs. We have the technology, as was shown in two blockbuster scientific movies,  Jurassic Park  and  Jurassic Park Returns with Exactly the Same Plot . Once we have the dinosaurs, all we need is an asteroid." - Dave Barry  "Waiting until everything is perfect before making a move is like waiting to start a trip until all the traffic lights are green." - Karen Ireland  And then there are two pillows that can be used for -- of all things -- your head. Those stay on the bed." - Scott Adams,  Dilbert Newsletter 31.0    "You cannot succeed by yourself. It's hard to find a rich hermit." - Jim Rohn  "No one is out to break your heart, it only seems that way." - Paul McCartney  "What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner." - Colette
