Coz she's here when i'm drain Pulls me up when i drop She accepts me for who i am And she still loves me thou i'm a brat...  My laugh is her laugh My smile is her smile My tears are thou its hers And my burdens..she lifts them up  Angela... is my inspiration My love And my care Thanks for being there with me Thru thick and thin And i'm sorry for causing you so much pain Now until forever You'll be my...inspiration
