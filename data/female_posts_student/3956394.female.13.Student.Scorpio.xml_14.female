Well i went swimming today already in 2 very diffrent locations and now im about to go swimming near my old house with a diffrent friend =P Believe me, none of us can stand the heat... i mean, major Tan!! Luckly, i dont want to get a tan so im going to a inside pool with my friend.Newton Wave Pool.Its crazy there! Crashing waves of cold water and water slide races.... ahhh, my summer is finally settling in.Although the part that everyone one is walking around in their bathing suits, bras and underwear... it is a little strange =P I mean, i dont really blame them though.If someone stayed out a whole day they'd be black >.  Sleeping with my sheets off is rare.I usually dont get that hot that fast but last night it did >.
