Then, upload it with the fun new Hello program that Blogger offers now.  I'm sure you can find an FAQ about it somewhere.  Congrats to all the winners!   Most Depressing Blog:   Craig       Allow me to explain.  Craig, Sean, Geoffrey, and I were hanging out at Cool Beans and were discussing our blogs.  Craig mentioned that he should get an award for most depressing blog.  I interjected that I always like to leave happy comments on his saddened posts, and we smiled about that.  Anyhoo, that is how I got the idea for my blog awards.  I dedicate all of these to Craig, and he receives the first award, naturally.   Best Writing in a Blog:   Chase       Anyone who reads it would agree.  Chase, you are a natural at writing.  Even though you may not think so, your posts just about your normal days are interesting.  I always enjoy your updates.  Best writing goes to you, my friend.   Funniest Blog:   Mary Katherine       Though everyone is a comedian these days, Mary Katherine is a comedianne.  Her quirky, English-style sense of humor never fails to strike a chord with me.  Cheery-O, old chap!   Most Insightful Blog:   Sean       With your many commentaries and quotes to ponder, who else would receive this award?  Thanks for giving us all food for thought, Sean.  This one's for you.   Most Inspiring Blog:   Jacob       Need I say more?  Jacob, your very nature is inspiring, and that is all too well reflected in your writing.  I always love to read your posts, as they put an inspiring and positive twist on life.   Most Smiles in a Blog:   Weesa       Do I need to explain this one?  Tee hee!  Louisa, my love, you light up all our lives with a smile, typed or not.  I enjoy reading your bloggiefriend, for it brings me the most smiles.  Hence, this award I bestow you.   Most Obese Blog:   Geoffrey       Geoff, I'm sorry but Owen insisted that I name your blog "Most Obese".  Just take it as a sign that he truly does like ya.   Obese = Coolest .  So you're "Most Coolest"!  Honestly.
