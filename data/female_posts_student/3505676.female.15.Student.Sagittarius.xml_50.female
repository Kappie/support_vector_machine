We think it was from heatstroke but the vet said his body temp wasnt THAT high...i dont know, but i was freaking out but having to stay calm since my mom was like SCREAMING! Everything seems okay today tho.  After that whole ordeal Christine came over, ate salads and such, haha attempted to make jill's sandwich, and then went to the notebook FINALLY! It was really good, reminded me of a lot of stuff, and to all guys--GO SEE IT! Girls won't question your manhood...that much!  Zab and Amanda *manager and guard from millbrook* were there too..saw me and waved.  Woohoo for movies and icecream!  I love that goodberry's is right there.  Hurray for mint w/ oreo.  Too bad chris hadta leave cuz of cilting the next day.  So yesterday i spent most of the day at millbrook swimming/sunning.  I was just in a 'pool mood.'  It was fine...hung out with jill some, allie, and trevor.  Got a bit of color..*smiley* but i still wore my sunblock! Got picked up, went to the mall, then had an inservice for cashiers @ opt.  Really fun actually--haha it was actually a blast!  I was sooo hyper.  Today i'm working from 12-5.  Then off to Emily's!
