She is watching  urlLink Love Actually.  I thought she may like it, it is a nice movie. I went out there before though and she was sound  urlLink asleep  sitting there.~Laughs~ So...no doubt she will not let on that she was asleep and say the movie was either good or bad.  urlLink Bless her !    The  urlLink Biggest one  is outside  urlLink working on his car  I think. Doing something boyish anyway.~ urlLink Rollz eyes ~. Me, well, I am bored actually.    So you have gone  urlLink fishing  hey. Hope you and the boyz don't fall in and get eaten by any  urlLink nasty sea creatures . Ewww how horrid would that be. I wonder if ya  urlLink Dadda  would jump in and save you? Not long til ya  urlLink mum  arrives home from  urlLink Bali.  Bags full of goodies for all of us hopefully. She had better bring me back a  urlLink Bali hut  or I will be  urlLink pizzed off  I can tell you Lou.~Grinz~   Anyway Loua I will run away again and hopefully catch up with you later.   See ya, love ya.      ~ urlLink Cartwheels out the door ~
