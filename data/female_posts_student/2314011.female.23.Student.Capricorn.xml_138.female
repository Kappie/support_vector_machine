Thought it would be okay for today, too, especially since I didn't get out of bed until 11 and wanted to get school stuff taken care of to hit the 430 show downtown.  Instead, I watched TV until noon and arrived here half an hour later.    It's been 3 hours and all I've got accomplished is typing notes from Friday's classes and reading one Property case.  Not sure I even can remember what I've read.  The movie's been pushed back to 7, so now I have more time to get through at least 2 (should be 3) Contracts cases, get home, crank out a couple of late-afternoon-early-evening pages and manage to salvage the remaining hours before I sleep.    Skipping morning pages sucks.
