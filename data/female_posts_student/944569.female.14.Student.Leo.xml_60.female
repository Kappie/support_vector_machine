For my mother, cranberries in white chocolate and a lovely salsa jar spoonrest.  My brother, a hand-painted (by me ) sleeping penguin ornament.  My friends, beanie babies and candy with some candles for some.  Merry Xmas to all,  Crisp and fine flakes of snow  Hiding in the trees Restless children thinking for the Ideal present to Show their parents Trinkets and chocolate  Made so merrily  And most important don't forget Santa is coming to visit...  Like my poem or hate it?  You be the judge send me a comment!
