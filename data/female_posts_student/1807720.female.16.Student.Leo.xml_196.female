I didn't understand the ratio question and I think even after I asked I still did it wrong.  I think that question was supposed to be easy, but I found it confusing.  As well, I don't think I did so hot on the M.C. part and I got confused on the long answer.  I just feel bad about it.  I do feel a bit better though because I went to say good-bye to my T.A. cause I won't see her again.  We had a long talk and stuff about everything, about school, marks, the Bio final.  She made me feel like everything will be ok.  I just hope it turns out that way.  I studied a lot for that final and put in a lot of effort.  I just wish it would pay off you know.  I know I can't ace everything, but I really deserve to do good on this.
