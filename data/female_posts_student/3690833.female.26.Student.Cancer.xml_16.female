"i just did this yesterday!"  perhaps it is this way because i am tiring of the routine.  get up,  let dog out,  check email,  drink coffee,  let dog back in,  take shower, (soak, shampoo, shave, conditioner, rinse)  dress for work, (black tank, jeans, docs)  apply makeup that will disappear after an hour of work,  check email again,  eat, or type blog,  go to work,  run around like a madwoman for a few hours,  sit,  smoke cigarettes, drink beer, converse,  go home,  drink more beer,  stay up too late,  finally go to sleep.   repeat.   janis joplin once said "...it's all the same fucking day, man..."   you said it janis.
