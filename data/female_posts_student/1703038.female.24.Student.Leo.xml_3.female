I'm not complaining...I think it's pretty fun and completely relaxing.  Anyway...the Internet service in my hometown is less than reliable, so no proctrated ramblings for at least a few more days.  In fact, I bet the connection'll time out before I finish this post. (Actually posting it is another story)   Anyway, be safe where you are and tune in next week...
