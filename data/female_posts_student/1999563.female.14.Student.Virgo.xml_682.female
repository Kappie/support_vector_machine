I didn't really want to go but my sister wanted to go and I HATE being home alone..so I went. It was alright. We got to go to starbucks for breakfeast so I got a PUMPKIN SCONE! So good. I get htose everytime I go to a starbucks. woot woot. Then I slept the whole way to the mountain [aboot 2.5 hours] once we got there I was like "Wheres the mountain?" see, there were So many trees you could barley see the "biggest mountain in the lower 48 states" [according to tour guide mom] It didn't seem that big. Mt. Saint Helens seems WAY bigger than it. Maybe because I have grown up with mountains. I always see them out my bedroom window. Whenever we leave the house you stare at them out the window. They are just kinda..there. Ever beautiful, never leaving. Well, the snow come and goes but the mountain is always there.  So we hiked a half mile and met up with my manly family [Haha!! That rhymed! well kinda...] they were stinky, smelly, but happy. They only got one shower all week. They smelled so bad!! I was like "Wow..what is that weird smell?" "Uh...that would be me!"  then we went out to lunch at this nasty little restaurant..[wel the food was fine..it just looked nasty.]  And then we went home!! Woooo woooo!!  I should be at church right now but I became enthraled with making my birthday list that I seem to have "forgotten" the time. Oh well. I didn't really want to go anyways. High school church is just so blah. Everything they teach is SO simple. I know Jesus loves me,  can we move onto something more complex? Like Judism..or something!! Or would that be o complex for our growing minds to take?  I like going to big church [new heights slang for where the pastor preaches!] SO MUCH! We acctually learn a ton. Everyone thinks it's so boring but it totally isn't.  Did you hear about that police man in the couv who got ran over when responding to a house call? I think he went to my church. I was watching the news today and I saw the news lady in front of my church. They were talking about him and how the funeral is going to be at "New Heights Batist Church."  Who was I with when I was talking about denominations? Because our church doesn't really vocalize the denomination ever so this person told me that meant we were non-denominational but I could have sworn I was Baptist [haha!] I guess I was correct.  My birthday is in 34 days!!! Well, after tonight it will be 33! But, "sad" news, I am not having a birthday party this year. Woohoo! I am excited because parties and having people over totally stresses me out. Because everything has to be perfect and organized or else I totally freak. And I don't have really any time to be planning a big brouhaha.   Ooh! I wrote a really cool preachy story thing! But I don't know if I will post it yet, I am saving it for HYPE! I think we are all going to take turns doing the "talk." I can't wait. I love to preach but people don't usually listen...
