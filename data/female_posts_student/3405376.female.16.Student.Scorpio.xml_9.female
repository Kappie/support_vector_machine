So next Saturday at 4pm (Eastern time) all Australian women are asked to walk out of their houses completely naked to help weed out any neighborhood terrorists.  Circling your block for one hour is recommended for this anti-terrorism effort.  All men are to position themselves in lawn chairs in front of their houses to prove they are not Taliban, and to demonstrate that they think it is okay to see nude women other than their wives.  AND to show support for all Australian women, and since the Taliban also does not approve of alcohol, a cold 6-pack at your side is further proof of your anti-taliban sentiment.  The Government appreciates your efforts to root out terrorists and applauds your participation in this anti-terrorist activity.  Thank You Fpor Your Assistance In This Matter!!
