Well for one, he's gorgeous and two, he's a really versatile actor and he's down-to-earth hehe feeling close!!! =) Anyway, yesterday we (me, Mian and Nikki) watched A Cinderella Story. I would rate it with 2.5 .... Guess it's just one of your typical Cinderella stories where Cindy girl or in this case Sam, played by Hilary Duff, is mistreated by her oh-so-evil stepmother and twin stepsisters. To tell you frankly, the only reason why I watched this movie is because of Chad Michael Murray... hehe =) I mean why the heck would I waste my money on a Hilary Duff movie?huh??!!! Anyway, I find the football field scene kinda cute. Austin (played by "my" hubbie, Chad Michael Murray) ran up to the bleachers and kissed Hilary then it suddenly rained for the first time in the movie since the setting of the story was summer and extremely drout and dry. For that one moment, I envied Hilary Duff..imagine she had a chance to kiss Chad! Hay... =) Of course, any remake of this fairy tale would always have a happy ending. They both ended up studying in Princeton and they finally found their true self. There was a slight modern twist in this remake but in my opinion it's still the same. I wouldn't recommend it for all people maybe if your a hoepless romantic type or plain Chad Murray fan then I'll give it a go but for people looking for something deeper...you'll never find it in this movie! For some people maybe you can wait it in video.
