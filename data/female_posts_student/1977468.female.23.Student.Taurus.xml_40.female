I don't care if your doing CPR on someone right now. This video is more importent.   Secondly my friends, many of us are familur with the one rule of engagement that holds true for all matters related to women.         Never get involved with, in any way, a girl who admittably enjoys romance novels.    There is no expection to this rule. But something has been forgotten, or often slips beneath the cracks. I am refering to TEEN GIRL MAGAZINES. This filth, gentlemen, is the propaganda of a society gone to sheol (a fancy word for hell). Stray from the crumbley and wicked path which can only been known as a subcription to "17" or whatever other magazine is your sick cup of tea. I only speak such vigilence because in my time of greatest weakness I have fallen prey to the seductions of gaining the infinate knowlage of the teen feminine world.   But all it not as it would appear.    This publications are rigged and formulated to be addictive in nature, with their colorful illustrations and their helpful "hints". I witnessed myself in my most pathetic state of being as I began to read "Simple Steps to Fearless Flirting" AND WAS INTRIGUED. Before a mere hour had passed I had given myself a palm reading (I am destined to be a scientist, but im also psychic), determined my special animal messenger (A Bunny), and had read the entirity of "10 Things Guys Wish Girls Knew"  WHICH WERE ALL ENTIRELY FALSE!!!!  These magazines create and define pre-existing problems for girls, and then offer theoretical but mostly just false advice on how to handle these situations.    All this crap was written by some 20-30 year old woman sitting in a tower somewhere in New York, and who thinks she still relates well to girls and their problems. The things they are tell girls about guys like me makes me want to vomit up my internal organs and then swallow them again so I can go hop on a plane, fly to New York, walk into the office of the editor of that magazine and puke my PRE-PUKED guts all over her. And if the "her" happens to be a "him", then I don't even know what I'd do. I don't even know.   I can't talk about this anymore.
