WTF HAPPENED TO ME MAN!!! I lao sai the whole morning and afternoon, I think at least 7 times.... FUCK! Anyway, I took a small nap around 3pm and moi darling heard me snore over the phone! KAKAKAKKAKAKA! Never mind lah, it's a matter of time so take this opportunity as a lesson to the first night together! AKKAKAKAKAKKAKK!    I woke up at 5pm in a daze and insisted that Mum should send me to Saltyflys' house which was so near... She was going to the hospital with Dad to see moi ah gong... Ah gong was fine last night at the Chalet but now in the hospital... This really proves what it meant by, you'll never know what's gonna happen next! So people, live the fucking life like there is no tomorrow or you're seriously gonna regret BIG TIME!! Mum was in a hurry and refused to send me over. She simply threw 5 bucks in front of me and said, “Go take a cab lah." Wah lau, this kinda mother also got.... CBCBCBCBCB! I have been a loyal customer to the local cab services since 17 ok. If I am not wrong, my contribution is definitely more than 5k! What a splurging I must admit!    I got outta the house at 5.15pm and called Saltyfly, telling her I am on my way to her house but she wanted to meet me in Westmall instead... Haiz... Poor me with no confidence, and super low morale still gotta appear make-upless in front of so many people... We met up approximately 15 mins later and went to the Supermarket to get the necessary ingredients for the LAKSA FEAST at her house! Bought a lot of HUM!! YUMMY!! I bought some BAK GUA PIES from the PAO DIAN stall next door. NICE! We took a cab back to her house (as usual, Princess C don't take buses nor MRT). While we were walking towards the taxi stand, someone called for us and we were both shocked to see the butterfly catcher from NHSS, Miss TONG YIN! I was being very fake ar... KAKAKKAKAKKA! I said,"Wah, pretty liao man!" It's all bullshit... Don't believe me when I said that because, I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BITCH AROUND! Erm... okie lah, must lose some weight first!    As I stepped into Saltys' house, I saw a lot of food on the table and was feeling a little full man... So many things how to eat sia... Those foods were complimentary from the neighbour as there was a wedding feast held earlier at the void deck. Oh yes, void deck! Went into her room and as usual, always so DIRTY! Dang... Got used to it anyway... KAKKAKAKAKKAKAK! I bought a packet of cigarette man... Was preparing myself for tomorrow! Sure a lot of time to smoke in school. YA! SCHOOL STARTS FOR ME AGAIN AND GUESS WHAT, I HATE SCHOOL! I HATE THE IDEA OF STUDYING AGAIN! PLS LET ME SLACK FOREVER! Sad... I felt dejected and super sianz... Haiz... The vicious cycle begins again and will go on for the next 6 mths... Lucky, it's just 6 mths! PUI!    I was smoking and checking some things out from the site call fridae. Well, shown Salty some pictures of Shamus and also moi darling and she thinks darling look like a Malay and Shamus look so beng! Anyway, went back to check my blog as I wanted to click on the link directing to Shamus' blog. I wasn't thinking of anything special but it shocked me when I saw his new entry... He wrote something around 6pm and he did mention me.... See below!     Jessica: Been reading and thinking. I dont know why you still come here to read? Cant deny the fact I still think of you many times everyday. The feeling is not lost; I'm just terriberly disasterific disappointed. If you wanna be with me, Look up for me. Ya about Snow White, She's someone new, very new. But she's not like what I call her, neither elegant or gorgeous, neither sweet or gentle. The opposite and the type no guys will like. haha Dont get too jealous about it. Or perhaps you should try to stay faithful to your boyfriend.     Well... I have decided to just leave him alone for the time being... Anyway, he does not have my new hp nos ar... I did not wanna give him or should I say... He is one of the reasons why I gave up my nos for 6 years... Anyway, I started downloading Windows Critical Updates for Salty as I think she seriously need to do some upgrades man! The thing started downloading and the estimated time given was 2hrs... Dang again... It was already 8pm so she cooked me a nice big bowl of Laksa and brought it in front of me and then said in Mandarin,"5 bucks!" Kaoz... So ex for a bowl of laksa... KAKKAKAKKA! But of course, she's kidding... I ate on and she went out to watch tv... Darling called when I was halfway through the delicious laksa and I stopped to speak with him. He had began his work of the day, night shift and he is on proactive 2, meaning he gotta drive around in the police car and wait for some stupid messages for him to attend to. I was rather full already, as I had pinched on some rendang earlier but still chose to finish everything... The downloads continue....    Yvonne and Laura was supposed to be there as well but seems like Uncle Mok is still not back yet... Salty was bugging me and telling me she needs STARBUCKS! Haiz... Siao Char Bor... She wanted very much to go out and look at those people. Weird? I'll rather stay home then to go out and look at ugly people... Soon as the download was over, Yvonne reached as well but without Laura as Laura has some assignment to complete. Sianz... No Laura, moi evil twin sister! KKAKAKKAKAKA! RETRIBUTIONS! Yvonne was hungry like mad already and Salty asked if we could hit Holland Village after her dinner. She wanted so so much to drink Latte... KI SIAO! I was trying to do a virus scan for the dumb pc but seems like it doesn't work at all so we decided to leave!    Darling SMS me at that very moment when we stepped outta Saltys' house, the message read, “Honey, come to Jurong area for car spin if you can later so we can see if we are fated to meet!" So cheeky... Since we were going to the expressway, we are bound to hit Jurong and I was thinking... Scarly so heng, really can see his patrol car! KAKKAKAKAKKAKA! No leh, he was at Teban at the moment and I was seconds away from Teban when I knew he was there. Hurhur! MEI YOU YUAN FEN LOH! Reached Holland and went to get drinks at StarBucks! The Malay girl who served me looked so weird... Something is just not right somewhere! Hiak!! I got myself a TAZO ICE TEA with RASPBERRY SYRUP. Used to drink that a lot when I was working in Conrad. Hee! Kinda reminds me the good old times... Oh, and also, APRICOT PEAR from Rocky Masters was one of my favourite too... TOO BAD! Supposed to be on my way home after Holland V but I decided to go back Saltys' house for another round of laksa!    We reached her place and she started cooking... YUMMY!! Hurhur! Can eat HUM again! So happy! We were watching TV and also checking out stuffs in fridae... Finally it was time to go le as it's already 12.40am liao. Got a super shocked when Yvonne saw a summon on her windscreen.... Haiz... 50 bucks and we split the cost.... I asked her to send me to a nearby ATM machine and took 25 bucks out for her... I told her, so long as you think it as, “Everything happens for a good cause!" and we'll not feel the pinch! She got me home and I was thinking if it's safe for her man... Kinda worried for her, as she might be too mad to drive... Took my shower immediately as I was too warm and tired to think...    When I was done, I called darling to let him know that I am home and bathed liao. Hee! We make a bet on the winner for the Euro Cup and he chose Portugal so I took Greece loh. I told Yvonne earlier that Greece will win the game! HURHUR! For the past few hours, I was checking mails as well as looking out for my Primary School friends in Friendster! HIAK! Shhhhhhhh... I lied to darling that I don't have a friendster account lah! Found a few people who looked familiar man! Left them some messages and then continue to checked my email till I felt like writing blog (poor Salty couldn't write her blog today because of what I had done to her pc earlier on!) Darling was still so busy as the stupid Lao Ban and Eddie purposely want him to do some foot patrol... Poor darling was already so dead tired, me too! I am left with 2 hours or sleep!! KAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAK! By the way, Greece won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAH! OLEH OLEH OLEH! SLEEP NOW!   Kisskiss!
