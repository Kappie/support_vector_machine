This is Cara reporting alone, because my co-host Heather is not yet aware that we are on air. Sometime in the next few days we will be fully up and running. ((WOW don't I sound official... commence eye-rolling... now)) HA well, until I confer with Heather, I really have nothing 2 say 2 any1 I guess. So, TTYL! Byeness!  ~Cara~   The first episode of BackTalk was brought to you by: 2grrls. Also known as Cara  Heather. Tune in next time for an actual discussion ((!)) on BackTalk.
