I am just a young, romantic girl who wants a guy to love her more than she does, a guy to take charge, a guy to give his support, advice and love. I want someone who enjoys pampering me, who can take me as I am, my past my history,someone lookingfor a love to last.one who I would never need to put up a pretence, a lover I could show all sides of me, a friend who will always be by me, a person I never have to use words to communicate with,    a special individual  .    is looking for such an individual too difficult in a society where interaction hasbecomes cold and remote and distant?  Like Disney always portrays it:    someday,my prince will come .     i  hope it existin our reality world.
