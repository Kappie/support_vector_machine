So Today, July 1st, I saw Spiderman 2!  haha, awesome movie!  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly suggest!  Then I proceeded to "sun-bathe" at my grandma's pool, certainly was worth the melanoma!  After a well deserved time to chill without the annoying brothers and sisters, I opted to attend Sarah's Birthday Party! eh...not bad, but no one really showed up, and I kinda was sleepy...you know how you can react to all the sun exposure from the afternoon!  wow, sure did make me sleepy!  So I can home and sat on the couch checking my email, to see if my friend from edgewood, emailed me back! tough luck, no response yet.  His name's Tom Klien, hes a "cool cat," from Hiawatha, Iowa.  I know the thought going through your mind-why the hell would you come to edgewood from Iowa?- well, he really liked the school, and the surroudings, I suppose thats a ligit reason. oh well, he was a really cool guy to meet right off the bat at registration! haha, thats my first "blog", see you tomorrow!
