Joystick Jockey  So maybe it's not the best way to meet a summer sweetie, but a dedicated gamer like you certainly knows how to beat the heat — hiding out in the great indoors, AC cranked. And it's about time you landed a plasma-screen gig — finally getting props for your dedication to couch conditioning and screen monitoring.  Let adrenaline junkies work their pecs, you've got the quickest reflexes this side of the Mississippi — and that's all the qualification you need when reporting to the keeper of high scores. So grab your joystick, chips-n-dip, and well-worn sofa seat — game on!  that is SOOO me!! speaking of which, i think im gonna go play some spyro...AFTER i do some french!! =P
