I had to write up behavior documentation on one of the little guys in my group for trying to hit, yelling, and spitting at other kids... he did more (and then some) of the same today, and got written up again... :-(  It makes me sad... I don't like writing up the little ones, especially this little one, because he's so sweet normally.  But, ever since he had his eye surgery he's gradually gotten worse... and I think he has a bad day in the classroom and it carries over into ASK.  :-(  I hope things get better tomorrow... aside from that, I've been making little Halloween favors for all the kids at A.S.K. and studying for all my classes... on the upside I got A's on my last two music tests... one in theory one in dictation... I'm doing good... :-)  Anyhow... have fun with WW this week... :-)    WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!     1.   Put these movies in order of your liking from greatest to least:  -Return to OZ -SLC PUNK -Sleepaway Camp -Secretary -Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  2.   Scooby or Scrappy Doo?   Definitely Scooby over Scrappy... cause Scrappy's annoying!  3.   Lightning Storms:  Good or bad?   GOOD!  I love to watch the lightning light up my room at night time...  4.   Jerm, John, or Owen?   John is probably my favorite, but Jerm follows at a close second.  5.   On the subject of pumpkins:  Carve those little devils or keep them around til Thanksgiving?   Well, I usually get several, carve one, and keep the others til Thanksgiving... but this year, 2 of my 3 are already spoiling... maybe I should plant them and let them take root like Ricky's onions... ; )
