Called 'Jing: King of Bandits' Deals with a guy called Jing and his crow/assistant named Kir. It shows a bunch of diffrent things. Theres also pirates in it. That score's it about 10 points extra.  Deary me, I am so excited. Track starts next week, that means, I HAVE to go on a diet. I need to workout more. The only problem is, I don't have determination enough to stick to any solid routine. Bah.  I havent had pop in like, a week. That is awesome. Not really. I want some now.  No, I do not have chipmunk cheeks.  I wonder what it would look like if I wrote everything backwards.. sdrawkcab gnihtyreve etorw I fi ekil kool dluow ti tahw rednow I.. ^^ That was so nifty! You know what I hate? Well, theres alot of things, but let's zoom in on one.. I hate when people use me, and then try and pull it off like they did nothing. Argh. It makes me so mad. I dont care anymore. Not anymore. bah.
