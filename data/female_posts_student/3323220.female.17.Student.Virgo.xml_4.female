Victor: Tmr I go to the shop find u. Victor: Do u mind go star-gazing wif me?  etc... Victor is a guy I knew at work. Though he same year as me, his thinking  behavior still dat kind of playful  havent-grown-up type. Lol..I dunno wat his msg means la. But I noe I treat him as frd only..if I agree to go out eat dinner wif him..it is only a friendly gesture. Hope he didnt think too much..He ar..always "buai gam" wif our supervisor  colleagues. He likes to talk back..as his frd..I dunno how to help him. I got say him..but he say I'm naggy like his mum. Lolx! Maybe I'm sensitive la..hee.. Hmm..thinking of Alex once in awhile. Izzit I reali like him le? I cant explain the feeling..I cant even say y I like him. haha..maybe he gave me the brotherly feeling. I used to wish for an elder bro. Some of my frds say they cant stand their bro and all. Maybe it's my female hormones doing sth to me. Haha! Maybe I juz crave for the protected feeling. Willy is doing an ok job..at being my FAKE BRO..lol..not bad la. Got him such a bro. Since he oso wan a sibling..and I wan an elder bro..JUZ NICE LOR. No more feelings for him..I knew..deep down in my heart. Now there's tis peacefulness in me now. I treasure it..and I dun wish to ruin in near future. K la..I gotta prepare liao. Gg Toa Payoh to eat dinner wif tis boy boy (Victor). HAHAHAHAH..if he noez wat I wrote in here...he'll kill me man! Lol..ciaoz!
