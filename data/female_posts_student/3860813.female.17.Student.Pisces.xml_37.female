(a lot)...it would be ok for me if hindi sobrang layo ng pinanggalingan ko.. but that's life... things happen for a reason.. hehe.. what i'm doing is for a cause... it's for me actually... so i guess i'm not rili in the position to get pissed off.. but duh!! as if i could help it.. if i could, i wouldn't be posting this message.. hehe.. i'd be posting something happy.. like.. my crush hugged me or something like that.. hehe.. thing is.. my crush didn't hug me.. hehe.. i just made that up hehe.. haven't even seen him today.. oh well.. got a lot to do.. hehe.. byee...  ps. i dnt have anything against ust.. it's just that super layo tlga nya from where i live.. hehe.. love ko ust kasi nandun karamihan ng friends ko.. but man.. it's really far.. hehe..
