I really hate playing it sometimes though. It seems like people would rather talk then play. For Christ sakes I don't go there to make friends. A/S/L? Has to be the most annoying thing I've ever been asked or seen. Last night this 12-year-old kid asked me if I was a virgin... I decided to be nice for once and answer his question with "I'm married what do you think?" Where he then proceeded to ask me if I would have sex with him. Now I don't know if this was a sting operation by cops or something but I had to chuckle to myself. Bless his little 12-year-old horny heart. Things sure have changed from when I was 12 which was about 11 years ago. I don't even recall the thoughts that I had back then but at least I knew that my biggest concern was playing with my Barbie's. Kids scare me now a days. I've told Rob that if we were ever expecting a baby and it was a girl.. I would make her go back in until she came out a he.  My cousin is 15 years old and she's part of the "I'm a popular kid that will do anything to make people think I'm cool" club. This club includes hanging out with 18 year olds and drinking beer until you throw up all over yourself. She's always been hell on wheels as long as I can remember. Whether it was cussing at the age of 6 or locking you out of the house while baby sitting her. I honestly believe she was the reason birth control was invented. Don't get me wrong kids can be fun too. Like all the times that we fed my youngest cousin, "lil dick" AKA Richard, a dog biscuit. I still can't get over the fact that when he threw up.. more then one bone was visible. Or even the time when we shot him with a paint ball gun and he ended up pissing his pants over it. Even the dragging behind a 4 wheeler on a sled and kicking dirt in his face was good times. If that isn't ground enough to have a boy then I don't know what is.
