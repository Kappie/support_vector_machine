WHY?     I'M STILL GOING TO CALIFORNIA!!  newman is still going to north carolina, and i'm still going to california! i'm worried i'll go there, and never want to leave.  too bad the plane ticket is round trip :). i've been trying to create a general agenda of our trip, just so we don't get there and jmo turns to me and says, "now what?"  here is, the general agenda, by hedish connor: sat:  fly into cali. it will be late when we get home so we'll just get settled in, and see what happens. sun: drive north, go to sausalito (5 miles north of san fran), and check out the scene, and most importantly, go to the red wood parks.  that's the most important part of the trip for me, to see redwoods. i don't know why, but they're calling me :).  mon-thurs: jmo and hedish are on thier own. we're going to spend two days in san francisco, and we have two other days to go wherever our hearts desire. being that it is crunch time at school i dont have this planned out.  but we will, soon.  fri-sun: woo hoo!  we're going to monterrey, santa cruz, etc... we're going to get a hotel room and just explore the beaches of california.  mon: i don't know yet? tues: we fly home :(  alright, it's time to escape to the wonderful world of academics. i am going to be reading until my eye balls fall out.  wish me luck!  fun!  and that's the way it is :)
