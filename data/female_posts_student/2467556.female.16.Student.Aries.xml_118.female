Saturday: I was at Nathan's party all day and it was awesome.  I got sunburned and i went tubing.  While tubing, Nathaniel and Madison both lost their pants or almost lost their pants twice and Sarah Cacetta lost hers once.  I never lost mine and i only fell off the tube twice.  Tubing was soooo intense.  I also got sunburned and my legs are slightly (note that word, slightly!) darker now.....its very exciting!!!  Oh yes and i officially declared Nathan my man slave, that was fun.  AND i slapped Taylor Kubic because....well....i honestly don't remember, but i've wanted to do that for a long time.  Oh and Nathaniel made me give up my chair because he gave me a hard time about being "chivalrous" well him and nathan both did.  Nathan got 2 yellow shirts for his bday, lol yay for yellow shirt day.  All and all a great day because i overcame my fear of lakes AND boats.  Nathaniel, you have to stop calling me a pansy because i'm not afraid anymore.    Sunday: i went to this graduation party of this girl thats my cousin that i didn't know existed.  it was....um....interesting.  First, the girl and her family were kinda....southern, to put it lightly.  I mean they had guns in their house for crying out loud.  So i sit there, by myself, staring at the guns while various people come by me and tell me how much i've grown and i just smile and nod because i have NO FRICKIN IDEA who the hell they are.  Thank god we left after 30 mins.  then i came home, slept.....got up 30 mins later and went to play vball with ash and linds and the gang.  it was fun.  school tommorrow...... :(  gotta go!  ~~~Taylor~~~
