Ooo lets get Joe the flannelt wearer! He is really starting to pee me off. What a man bitch. Lets give him a bitch slap.   I have decided I want a mini. A proper nice mini, I want some mini adventures.  I have also decided that I can't be arsed to be unhappy anymore while actually at school because it just pisses everyone else off so I will be 'happy' and I won't annoy you all, that much. I say that much because I am sure I will annoy you at some point for some reasons and oh my gosh Tom is strong he can pick me up and carry me. He carried me across the common room earlier. So did Rudland. I was amazed.   But enough of that.  BRB I got chocolate to go get. . . . . . . . . . . . Ok I'mback and now I am eating chocolate which I shouldn't because eating chocolate makes you insanely fat. Well not you, me. I once wanted to be a model. Pah. Good dream that was. You gotta be thin to do that.  Fucking bloody quality street. I mean what a total rip off. They are tiny now. Not the good nice big one we used to get. Now they are tiny. Little fuckers.  I want the YMCA on cd because I want to go cheer myself up but I can't because I don't have it on CD and nor do I have Buttercup on cd and I can't be bothered to do much else except moan on here so you can put up with it.  Actually I can't even be bothered to moan now. I think I'm gonna go sit on msn and annoy whoever is online. Lets have a look.. Lisa. Nah I won't annoy her. Max. Oi Max blog biatch. Ant. Hmmm. I haven't spoken to him in a while. Maybe. Jason. Nah don't speak to him much. Jane. Nah. Although she is fun to annoy. Charlie. No I like Charlie. Me. No I won't annoy myself oh wait too late already have. Eddie. Nah. Too much effort that. Lora. Nah. an no one else is online because THEY ARE ALL DOING DRAMA. I really want to watch the Sound Of Music but my sister has the video so ahh. Maybe i will go watch Sister Act 2? Who knows??  Or maybe I will just sit here and FUME.
