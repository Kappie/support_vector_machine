I like that movie i've seen it several time and its just neat...then i took a shower. Before i went outside i ate some lunch then went out to mow the pasture. my goal this summer is to mow the whole thingy by  myself  but everytime i attempt it either grandpa comes out and helps or my dad. today i told grandpa i wanted to do it myself so then dad came out w/ his other lawnmower which is the new one and its awesome! it has power steering...anywho m.b. mowed w/ me. while i was mowing today i decided to work on my tan so i put on my swimming suit and mowed. im a little pinkish which is good. so now im home and i just downloaded two songs:  Gigalo  - nick cannon and r. kelly and  tear it up  - yung won, DMX, David Banner, and Lil Flip. i still like my rock music and pop music but now im into the r and rap thing.
