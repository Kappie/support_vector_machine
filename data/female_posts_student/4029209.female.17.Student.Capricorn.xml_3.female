I've decided to create a blog, partly cos of the fact everyone else in, (yeah i'm a sheep :( - so sue me) but alsobecause i like the idea of writing down what's going on. With things changing so quickly right now, it seems a good idea.   So, here i go :P. I hope everyone enjoys reading this, if only just to laugh at my life lol.   Bye for now :)
