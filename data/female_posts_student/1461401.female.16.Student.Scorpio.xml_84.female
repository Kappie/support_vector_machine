All those dark little swirls outlining the farthest parts of your soul. The parts you wish you could forget was there. The ones that make you revengful, or bitter, or spiteful. The swirls are getting bigger. Darker. Reacher farther out than their previous confinments. My body is rigid in a kind of fixed hatred. I just stare. And stare. I see you. Not moving. Not saying a word. While I'm sceaming all the things I've ever wanted to say to you. In my head. Where you are still protected from the truth.  For now. The swirls are getting bigger. Darker. Clouding my eyes with what I don't want to see. My mind enters the bittersweet confines of contempt.   Thanks for the help... friend...
