I don't want to type this all out, so I'll tell the lot of you, if you really want to know. I must say, I didn't know I could use the word "fuck" in so many simultaneous contexts. Not that I remember. It was all "Id". I remember waking up crying and calling the blood pressure machine a "stupid, stupid bitch", to which my mom, who was right next to me, smiled and agreed. Apparently I had been cursing everything quite profusely before the drugs wore enough that I was able to take control of myself again. I even looked up to the doctor and called her something to the effect of a "stupid fucking whore". She laughed. Doctors.  And right now, I'm feeling really out of it. I laugh at the most random shit. I can't think worth shit. The only things I can think are "eat eat eat", "pain pain pain" or "nothingnothingnothing". Well, I might be thinkin a little more than that, because I made this post.  The sad this is: they gave me an amnesic, to help me forget the proceedure, and while I did, for the most part, these things have an effect on my dad's side of the family of wiping our memory for the entire day. I feel like if I apply myself I might be able to remember what the hell went on today. But, chances are, I'm going to wake up tomorrow, get on the BLog, and wonder when the hell I posted the day before, or, for that matter, if there was a day before.  Alls I know is: drugs are really fucking good. Heheh.  No, really.
