Tonight is Sangria Spectacular and tomorrow is fourth Friday where our department encourages us to attend happy hour together. So I am really feeling the effects of lent but I do feel good about myself for not partaking in the consumption of alcohol. The biggest problem now is that I am counting down the days and I feel that this may be taking away from the cause. On the other hand the last time I drank I didn't feel good so the thought isn't that appealing to me.   I have been completely nonproductive today. I had a beautiful test at 7:30 this morning that I know I missed a 12 point question on and I don't know how to feel about the rest. So its been an incredibly long day but I think hang out time with everyone is going to be good for me tonight. Zach is bringing his friend who was picking on me in while I was in an alcoholic state but this time I will be sober and I wont be showing cleavage to make him miss his pool shots. I hope I make a better impression this time! Oh the things I wish I hadn't done while intoxicated!
