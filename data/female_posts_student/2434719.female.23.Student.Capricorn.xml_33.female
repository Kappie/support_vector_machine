I WANT SOLE CUSTODY OF MY EGYPTIAN COTTON!!  so, can i have my own bedroom when i'm married? i brought this up to a friend last night, and naturally he said no.  and so, i can't get married.  ever.  i don't think it's fair to make another live in flowery-foo-foo if they don't like it.  and no man i marry, will like the flowery-foo-foo.   and jason brought up a good point: women usually have control of the bedroom, and alot of the house... and the men take on the entertainment room or things like that... where the technical gadgets are.  and when i think about it though, i don't really like flowery-foo-foo. and i know he won't care about my super high count sheets. he might do things like, not be clean.  and i'll do things like, inwardly freak out and then get a divorce 5 years later of something stupid, and i'll blurt out at the court hearing, "YOU MAKE MY SHEETS DIRTY!"    scrabble COUTURE:  scrabble update: i am still champion. count the letters in that word baby. yeah.  there really isn't anything like playing scrabble in a public place. it ALEIVES the soul. give me a SLIBBER of that, chief!    WHITE HOT  i've been really happy the past few days becuase of my new sheets and pillows.  it almost makes me sad that this is what my life is coming to.   i say almost becuase i look at my bed and i glow with satisfaction.    breaking news: AREA FAMILY BUYS YET ANOTHER SUV  so i'm going to be freelancing again this summer. get this, for the 1960 sun! Am I the only one who laughs at that? Shit, it's money and more published writing under my belt. it won't hurt. now i have a job, but i don't have rent or bills while living at home... so um, yay!     MY FOUR SIDES ACHE  well, i got an A on that big term paper! AND, I got an A on my term project/presentation. damn, i'm good. school will be over in 15 days according to my profile countdown; joy is around the corner!  especially with this bright sun shining, there's no way to feel down.  the energy of spring green trees and blooming flowers can uplift even the lowest low. not that i feel those, i have new sheets.  now i'm going to go lock myself in the library away from the happy light. masochist. :)
