In that instant, the lightning flashed, the rain started pouring again, and the clouds closed together in a snap. Immediately shutting out any good feelings I had felt about the world in that instant.  Zeke turned so his back was in front of me, and stood face to face with the Queen.  “Your Majesty,” he bowed low. I wondered briefly, why he didn’t call her mother. Then the King stepped out from behind the Queens intimidating form.  “Who’s th-th-this?” The King asked leaning over to peek behind his son.  “Father this is the girl I’ve danced with all night,” He stepped aside, and bowed again. I tried my best to curtsey, but it was difficult because as I wasn’t in a dress.  “Are you a lady?” The Queen asked while opening her fan abruptly. If you were to bet that was going to use it for a light breeze even in the rain, you would have lost that bet. She held the fan over her head for a moment, and then let go. It hovered over her head, and shielded her face from getting drenched, and running her make-up down her monstrous nose.  “Well, I suppose so,” I replied, still facing the ground.  “Stand up, and let me have a look at you,” she demanded. I rose, and glanced over at the Prince, he was inching away from the Queen and his father as quietly as possible.  The Queen walked around me taking me all in. The King seemed to be moving backwards as well. I stood up as straight as possible, letting the rain soak me through, wishing for an out.  “You should be in a dress,” she hit me on the head with her fan. Now I stood wearing a burgundy dress that had a long slim skirt, and an empire waist. The straps and lace at the top of my shirt had stayed the same. My hair pulled itself up and out of my face, all except for my bangs. The Queen circled me again.  “What are you doing here?” She said harshly, sticking her nose up next to mine.   “N-now, dear, you sh-shouldn’t be so r-r-rough with the child. She’s f-f-frightened you see,” the King tried to help me. The Queen snapped him a dirty look, and he shut his mouth quickly. I stared ahead looking at nothing, and not moving. I thought for a moment and replied with the best answer I could think of.  “Just, trying to get home, your majesty,” I said honestly, trying to swallow my fear.  “Don’t you know the way?” she smirked at me, and I glanced at the Prince. He wasn’t moving backwards any more.  “Your Majesty, please don’t. I enjoy her company,” he said quickly. I turned and looked at the queen. She was still grinning ferociously.  “Don’t you want to go home darling girl?” She said without moving her lips. I nodded silently just wanting to get away from her wicked presence. She leaned on the tree, and then hit it with her fan. A piece dropped out, and a dark entry way appeared. “Well then, walk through there,” She pointed with her fan, and I followed its path unsure of what to do.  Vaguely I heard the Prince telling me to come back out of the tree, but I didn’t listen. I just wanted out of the Queen’s gaze.  I started falling fast, and I couldn’t see anything to save my life, nor could I reach for anything to hold myself up. I flipped in circles, and spun too quickly for my head to readjust itself. Without a warning, I landed in my pool again. I jerked to life as if waking from a bad dream, and in doing so inhaled what seemed like all the poorly chlorinated water in my pool.  I choked on what I had thought was air, trying to scream for help. I grew dizzy, and couldn’t move my limbs while my brain screamed for me to get out of the pool and get some oxygen. Things were growing dark again, and I could see Jack peering over the fence looking for me. I screamed at him in my head, but he couldn’t hear me. I couldn’t move my arms even to splash a warning. He turned and walked away.  Things darkened to a pitch black that I had never felt in my life. The air around me was cold. I heard a voice from somewhere in the background. I found control of my limbs again, and turned. To my surprise, I was standing out in the field of lights again. There were trees this time, and sad souls hung empty from them. I turned around taking everything in, and then I knew where I was supposed to go.  I walked straight through all the trees, and there stood the Prince waiting for me. He held me in his arms for a moment, and then the Queen stood next to the both of us. She kissed my forehead, and wings appeared from my back. I smiled, and took the Prince’s hand. Then we both flew away quietly into the dark horizon. I could see my little Bob shaking his head sadly at the bottom of the hill. I saw the girl from the tree, and the other from the forest dancing together ahead of us. I felt the loneliness of never hearing my family’s voices again. And I sighed, because I had never really gotten out of life what I had come here to find.
