Sure, the Appellate Brief has loomed large since its distribution, and last weekend's surprise attack of the Issue Statement brought the scope of the assignment into sharper focus.  This week, though, has brought with it not only the confirmation of that realization, but also the knowing that preparations for finals will soon be in full swing.  Yes, only half-way through the semester and it's time to start preparing for finals.  So that whole: "If I'm not working on homework, the paper or outlining at each moment of the day (until about 8 or 9--I still demand an hour or two to myself), something's wrong" thing has arrived a good month early.    But we got a bit of a break today with the canceling of Contracts this morning.  And instead of using the hour to read for tomorrow or more cases for the Brief, I moved tables for the blood drive, wrote notes on chalkboards (my first official duties as the new Women's Law Caucus Treasurer) and am now blogging.  Fine.  So I'll have an extra hour to myself today.  Sue me.
