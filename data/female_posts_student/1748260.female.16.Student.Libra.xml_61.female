No slippers allowed.... and I'm gonna wake up early for helping out in 8am Sunday school man..10.30am ushering.. then 8am Sunday School... fun huh.. today went with the youths for lunch at FUNAN The IT Mall.. It was quite fun meddling with the computers we see around... But Audrey kept on clinging to Rowena..poor thing.. then when Rowena left.. she cling on to Joanne.. back in church.. she stuck on to Gloria... haiz... Honestly juz can't stand her... each time she talks to me she starts crapping about Sabrina  Amanda.. gossips about them ringing in my ear. Imagine a bee buzzing in your ear.. THAT'S HOW IT'S LIKE!  Just hafta keep my distance away from her I guess..
