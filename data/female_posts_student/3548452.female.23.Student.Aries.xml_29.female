She had the attention of everyone, the servers, the guest and even my man  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, I had to get a closer look I needed to get a view of this woman, with whose presence the room was overtook  So I did it, I ran up to her we collided she said excuse me are you OK She introduced her self, as serenity, I said hello my name is Shay  She said it is nice to meet you Shay I'll look forward to your prayer I wondered what she meant by all that I just wanted to check out her hair  As I got a little closer, my eyes could not believe All of this time I was going insane And all along this lady had a weave.  I'm all sweating and shaking, angry with my self Because she thought that she looked so good But now I see she doesn't compare to me Although I know she wish she could  Oh now I feel good I can leave what I thought behind Right at that moment a loud bell sounded she said gather around it is time  She took the mic from the podium, Mrs.  Grace, Ms.  Thang, Ms.  Fine She said thank you all for coming; tonight I appeared to be a great dancer. But as you know this is my going away party for I am rapidly dying of Cancer.  I want to thank God for keeping me full of praise, vibrant, healthy and strong For it is only through him that I walk with great joy for his love, mercy and grace has truly shown I've lost my hair, both of my breasts, and next I'll lose this life But I can hold my head up in confidence knowing that when I die I'll die knowing Jesus Christ  So I say to everyone here tonight no matter whom you are Your outer being will shine so bright When Jesus is your Morning Star I say to those who are struggling, no matter what you are going through With God in your life, his word in your heart, he will make your life brand new  I wept and cried all night how stupid of me to sum up this woman's life. She had to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Because If I were in her shoes.  I would have never shown up this night  Thought: Do not judge a book by it's cover, because between the pages are many untold stories that can not be read from the outside  Be blessed.......
