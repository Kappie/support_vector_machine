My temprature was 106.5 I was taken to the room immeadiately and they put in IV. took blood, lots of it, gave me Motrin for the fever and two saline bags to get me to pee. I gave a urine sample and they told me that i have a severe kidney infection. Sweet, its only the kidneys. what ever. Friday and Saturday i couldnt even keep down water. I'm geting better, but this still sucks.
