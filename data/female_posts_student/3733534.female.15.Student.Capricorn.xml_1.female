We need to notice the details in the little things, or else we might overlook something and be angry by what we THOUGHT we saw.  For example.  I came home and my brother had taken my room again and so, I got irritated with him, yes, but I went to sleep in his room nevertheless.  I woke up this morning ready to go downstairs and say goodmorning.  Well, nobody knew I had been home for the whole night.  I could have died and nobody would have known.  They thought that my brother, was sound asleep in his own bed.  They never took the time to look at the face with her eyes closed.  They just assumed.  Then when my brother came from the basement, nobody thought to think, 'OH he slept in the basement that much be Sunny in his room.'  No, I went unnoticed.  Mom and Dad were angry at me when I walked into the room to say goodmorning.  There questions were, "where did you come from?  Where have you been?"  I felt stupid when I had to tell them.  I was in Artie's room sleeping because he took mine.  You know, if people would take time to notice the simple things in life like the fact that I have hair and Artie doesn't so how could I be Artie, then the world would probably run a whole lot smoother in the long run.  And just think, if you do take time and slow down to look at things, the world is a whole lot more beautiful.  Well, do you want another example?   My brother (the one in my room) just came in the house and he walked up to me and asked me if I knew who's clothes he was wearing.  I thought they were his.  No, he was wearing my mother's shirt and my mother's jeans.  If he would have taken notice and thought, 'these jeans are way too long for me' then he should have known not to put them on to give them to someone else because he knew they were not his.  The only thing that could have thrown him off is that the jeans fit him around the waste.  He is 11 years old and wearing my mother's clothes.  Hmm...  I know that these things are simple, but they make a difference nevertheless.  I must go and pick out my little brother's clothes for now.  BBQ to go to tongight.  Yeah!  REMEMBER: take time to look around...find out what you see.
