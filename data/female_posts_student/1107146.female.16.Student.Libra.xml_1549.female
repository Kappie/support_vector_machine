I know  absolutely nothing about video games, mostly cause I've never played, really (you can add it to my list, Scott), but everyone knows that Coke is the best "soda" in the world.  But burnt popcorn sucks.  That's about all yall talked about this week, which is kind of sad, but now I'm caught up.
