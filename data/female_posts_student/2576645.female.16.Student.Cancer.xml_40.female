So, Mrs. Boyden, that was just a polite way to tell me I'm screwed??  Yes,yes....I see through your sharade....  I've come to the point where I just don't care anymore about school.   Screw my speech to inform.  Screw Julius Caeser.  Screw animal classifications.  Screw MEAP math problems.  The only subject I like is American History.  With the past, you don't have to question. What is done, is done. It is all set in stone. That is what I like about it....no thinking outside the box....which is what I always have a hard time with.   Not to say that I'm going to let my grades sag.....oh no....I'm too obsessed with getting into college to let that happen.   By the way... why am I that obsessed about it?   I've forgotten.  Good job? Good money? Good social standing?   Was it all of those reasons? None? Maybe one I haven't named yet...or have yet to place my finger upon?  That is probably it: I just haven't decided yet......  This situation happens to me often.    Song of the Day:'Keep it Together'- Guster
