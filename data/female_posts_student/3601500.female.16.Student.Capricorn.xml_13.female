I hope my pj pants can be salvaged. -.- I feel frustrated, obviously. And lately I feel like there's nothing worth doing. Must be PMS - I'm kinda glad, it's not depression. '-' Well, I feel like some ranting's coming...  So I'm having fun getting my little sister to memorize japanese greetings and common words. Caro wants to learn, it's cute. ...Alright, maybe I shouldn't have taught her 'kawaii', she's bouncing all over. Her pronunciation isn't great - not even good. And yes, I'm getting annoyed for nothing. Damn this sucks.  I need to clean my room. Actually, the whole house needs cleaning. I'm fucking tired of being the only responsible one in this house. *I* clean, and they make a mess. That's one of the things that make me depressed. Everyone is fucked up.   Ungrateful little twits my sisters are. Even my older sister - if she gets a gift she doesn't like, she doesn't even thank the person. She sulks - like intentions are worth nothing - and gets in a worse mood if the gift cost a lot (what a waste of money). She's like that: all happy, or all unhappy. She likes staying in the basement and writing about FMA (incest, yaoi, violence, smut, etc), watching anime (mostly FMA), etc. Also prone to depression, doubts she has a future (she hates University). Goes to bed at sunrise (an habit I seem to be following myself, lately). I love her, though. Miss her.  My little 14-years old sister, Evil, beats up our little sister, insults our mother, and spends her time screaming and depressing when away from the computer. She releases her tension at home, since at school she's very quiet and 'an angel'. Suckers are the people who think that. Her hobbies include walking around naked, insulting anything moving, playing Unreal tournament and taking naughty pictures of herself to send to her online boyfriend. Sparodically nice, but very susceptible.  My youngest sister, who's 11, spends her time away from home, playing with the neighbours. She's naturally very annoying (ugh, that high-pitch scream of hers!) and Evil can't stand her. Very stubborn, she doesn't hesitate to annoy Evil until she gets hurt. When she's home, she mostly bothers me, but keeps me company. Sometimes sneaks into my bed at night before I go to sleep, and when I get there she's taking all the space. She can be a little manipulative devil, pleading and screaming and threatening our mother until she gets what she wants.   Mother. Weakling. Always away, even though she doesn't work that much. 1-I wish she'd find a steady job. I understand my dad was the one working before he left, and she hadn't worked in 18 years. But she went from gardener to teacher to massage therapist to cook (...and more). 2-I wish she'd clean the house, and stop helping to mess it up! Everyone in my house is ashamed and so, we don't have visit. It makes me feel guilty to always go to my friend's house, when I don't invite her over. 3-I wish she'd scowld my little sisters. There is no discipline in this house, and it seems my mom can't say no. She rewards Evil, when you kow how terrible she is. Example? She bought her a damn Gamecube for Christmas, at the time when she didn't have a job! So I told her it had to be a gift for the three of us. Also, she does nothing when she gets insulted - the only thing she can do, is scream, and of course we're used to do by now. Nice irritant. UGH, whatever. 4-I wish she'd cook our meals... She isn't there too often, when she could be. We don't eat at regular hours, and as a result my little sisters often don't eat well, if at all. Of course I often bake something, but they're not around to eat. Currently? She's at a family party with her girlfriend.  I curse the day my dad left. And now he's moved in with his girlfriend, where my older sister lives. I wonder what keeps me sane. Er, maybe I'm *not*. You tell me.
