SHOCK!  Oh well.  We already invited people and no use in univiting them, right?  I am bummed because even though I know she won't want to go to things, I invite her.  It is just a gesture, you know?  How do you celebrate without family?  UGH  I am not going to stress over it.  It is what it is.  Sucky part is we hear about the plans from someone other than her.  Oh well.  I am kicking myself for even getting all worked up.  It is life, right?  Anyway, I guess it is just me...I have always been glued to my family.  Even when I moved out, I still called my parents almost everyday.  Hell, I even chose to live with my family.  I love being with my family, I feel complete.  Sometimes crazy, but complete.  Seriously.  I hope Ed feels the same, I think he does.  I know he loves my family like his own.  I know that for the most part my family loves him just as much.  Anyway, this turned into a rant and I didn't mean it to.  i just am frustrated because no matter what, I just can't connect with my own sister.  No matter how hard or how little I try.  Goodnite guys.  Oh and I won't be posting for a few days because I am attending my "cousin's" wedding.  WOOHOO!  It's about time.
