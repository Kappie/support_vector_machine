And so no one is home, so I figure it wouldn't be a problem to strip out of the frickin hot dress I had been wearing in my living room. But just as I get it off, I realize the door's open and my cat is leaping outside, happily. Now, the thing is... My cat is an indoor cat. She's not supposed to be outside. And so, not thinking, I run outside after my cat in my under garments. My cat leads me across the side of my house, and into my neighbour's yard. I honestly wasn't even thinking, but I grabbed my cat, and turned to go inside when I noticed my neighbour's WHOLE family sitting on the back porch. Since when are they home that early, I think. But it turns out it's 6:30 and they were all set on having a nice barbecue in their scenic backyard. So I waved, smiled, then went back inside.  Oh man. I'm an interesting one.
