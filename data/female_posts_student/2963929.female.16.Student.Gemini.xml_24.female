Are you free from blame?  Do you need to clear yourself from people's accusation or suspicion? Have you defend and justify yourself from wrong? Do you ever exact revenge for someone or even yourself?        Do everything without feeling guilty and regretful...you will be happier that way.        I have done everything to let a person feel the importance of him in my life. Although i knew the answer and the outcome all along, I still hope a miracle can happen.        And I am flawed      But I am cleaning up so well      I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself      [Vindicated][Dashboard Confessional]
