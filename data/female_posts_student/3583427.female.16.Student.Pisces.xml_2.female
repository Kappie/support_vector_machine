I know I've said that A million times, but it's so hard to feel isolated from all of your friends. I don't even know what being sane is anymore. He has been foremost in my thoughts...It kills me to think that on Wednesday, it will be our 10 month anniversary, and I can't see him, or talk to him...Stupid life. But hey, what can I do? Like I said before, I gotta stay strong.   Anyways, I have provincials and crap to get through. Blah. Can't wait until it is all over. It'll be fun. Mhmm...  Well, That's it for my rant. I'm not really in the mood to talk about stuff anymore. Don't know why...I just feel...Bleh. FRIK I MISS HIM :(...  This is Aman, Signing off ...
