Then Mom took me to Meijers and I got some soundtracks. Now i'm contemplating whether to stay up or to go back to bed. Tonight we're going out to eat with Grandpa and that's pretty much it in my life. 
      You know how your parents say, "You're only 15." You aren't ONLY 15 but you ARE 15. *sigh* This is a day I wanna be older...life...
