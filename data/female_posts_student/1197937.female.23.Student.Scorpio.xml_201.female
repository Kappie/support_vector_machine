Note: Two things that my pictures did not capture, and what i actually liked the most about the place, were the beauty of clear running water, such as the creeks and gourges, and the warmth of the ppl in the town of Ithaca.   p.s. in the previous entry, i meant the acronym P.A.G.I.E.K.I.P. to stand for "Prettiest," not just "Pretty." Hope that makes more sense.
