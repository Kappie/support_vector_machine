The only positive to that is the fact I am doing laundry and I can hang it out to dry and not put it in the dryer. I hate the sun. I mean not hate as in wish it was gone but hate as in wish it wasnt so bright and so hot outside. So here I sit in the house doing laundry washing and hanging out to dry and washing and hanging out to dry. Attempting to get up the energy to do some more packing. Yeah right like that is going to happen. Tony just went to the store for soda. Personally I could use more water and will be drinking more. My blood pressure is way to high I think they are going to put me on medication for it. (sigh) Travis is in the bedroom on the phone. I swear I will be glad when I am moved out of here and he is NOT with me. Joey is at the movies with some friends. I'm thinking of watching the movie "Last Sameri" It looks good. Considering Tony enjoyed Troy he might like that one too. All Travis can do is talk about cars (boring) or bitch at people for saying Alexis' name. He got mad at someone for using the phone last night becuase he was "expecting" a call.. when Joey asked if it was Alexis he jumped Joey and yelled at him for thinking it. No it wasn't her it was her mother Marina. CRAP.. I swear I will be so glad when it's all done and over with. (sigh).    A.C. hasnt gotten back yet. I want to write him so much but I dont want to fill his mail box up. I know he said I could write anytime but. Gods I wish he would hurry home I am so worried with all the stuff going on overseas. I dont know what to write.
