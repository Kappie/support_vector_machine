The one that involves some sort of bizarre love triangle between my best friend, Kyle, Erin and myself. I honestly don't know where to begin, but I'm really not going to go through the whole thing. But I'll sum it up: Erin met Kyle through my friends and I. Erin fell in love with Kyle. Erin didn't know that I had been in love with Kyle all along. Erin kissed Kyle. Twice. Erin found out about how I felt. Erin doesn't care. And she hasn't backed off.   Now when I told her how I felt things seemed to be okay. But then she started saying things like, "Well maybe you'll get over him and it'll be okay." and stupid stuff like that that made me think that she really didn't care how I was feeling at all, she was just interested in her own wants. And we talked about the whole issue in great detail. She agreed that she wouldn't pursue anything with Kyle so long as I liked him. But really, she's still after him, but in a more subtle way. How I see it is if she were only interested in a friendship, then she'd be inviting some of *my* other friends over to her house along with him behind my back. But honestly, she's just trying to get close with him, but in a friendly, "innocent" manner. So basically, she hasn't backed off at all.It seems like she's constantly trying to screw me over.   And I talked to Kyle about all this. He says that I'm his best friend (which I knew) and that he'll do absolutely anything to make things okay between us (me and him, not me and Erin). And I believe him, because I know he cares. But his friend, Cordell was talking to me and told me that Kyle had feelings for me too. He just didn't want anyone to get hurt. But I guess he doesn't realize that that is already happening.   God, I don't know what to do.
