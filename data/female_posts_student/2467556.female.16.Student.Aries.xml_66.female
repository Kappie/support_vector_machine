Come and represent.  oh god of high school hockey please let us win.  maybe if we get more fans, then they'll win.  *crosses fingers*  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: he wore yellow and it was a nice color for him. Made his hair look slightly less terrible, but not by alot.  i didn't get a chance to see his shoes but i can bet $10 that they were the socks with sandals thing again.  and he wore the......you guessed it.....the ugly tan jacket.    Today in aerobics we had to do this "Sweating to the Oldies with Richard Simmons" movie thing.  IT WAS SO FLIPPIN FUNNY.  it was brilliant.  SIZZLE!!  lol nadia and kendra.  it was like spirit fingers extreme.  i swear Richard Simmons is SO FREAKING GAY.  I mean the boy is infiltrated with estrogen.  lol, yeah that was the amusing part of my day.  hmmmmm....i would write more about the gayness of the movie but i'm kinda tired right now and i have to do homework.  lemme just say one last thing: that movie was the most LSD-induced workout video i've ever seen.  thank you for your time.  Go Coppell! *prays* ~~~Taylor~~~
