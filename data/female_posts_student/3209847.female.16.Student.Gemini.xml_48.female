My life has taken tangents and turns I didn't want it to take. This is taylor blogging for the sarah/taylor blog. Its going to be somewhat long.   First of all, Sarah had a wonderful birthday. I don't think many of you understand how fully remarkable sarah is. She just makes me alive. I didn't know i could put so much trust in to one human being. Its unreal. I have given her my life and she has kept me so alive and so unbelievably happy. Skeptics would say i'm just infatuated and too young to know what love is. I don't think they're right, but i'll give them a chance. I'll prove it to them. I love you so much Sarah. Nothing will ever be so large that we can't fight through. We have gotten through so much already. She is my miracle. She saved me from a life that i didn't want to live anymore. I know it all sounds so cliche. Perhaps it is. I don't care what its called.   Me, her mom, and her celebrated her 18th birthday. I just was beaming all day, so full of joy and happiness for HER. I wanted Sarah to have the best birthday that she could possibly have. I worked alot on her present and such. She loved it. I am so glad that she did. She made me happy too. We took her to Red Lobster, and I enjoyed food that I never would have tried if I hadn't have met Sarah. She got a digital camera from her parents and has been taking pictures since. I really hope her birthday was special. I sure tried to make it good for her.   Work has been pretty much uneventful. The usual kids, with the usual unusual perks and smiles that can make me inevitably happy. I really do enjoy children. Friday night, my dad wanted to talk to me about some things that I started to take very personally. Basically, one thing led to another and our lives became out of the control of anyone. I couldn't control my life, my dad couldn't control his. We were trapped in this hell hole of no returning except by some little fate and hope beyond our reach friday night, saturday, and sunday. He left after our fight and didn't return until late saturday night. I felt lost. I felt that there was nothing I could do. I didn't do anything wrong. I just, didn't understand, that's all. Its all better now. That's all I can say. Life sometimes is like a tornado. Most of the time it completely misses you, and life is normal. But sometimes it gets picked up in the tornado and then we are spat back out, trying to arrange things to how they were before.  I love life sometimes. I miss sarah. I'm really doing pretty good right now. I'm getting a little excited about europe, but extremely anxious. I'm going to miss sarah so much. I hope she is okay without me. We can make it. We always do.
