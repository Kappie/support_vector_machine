Talk on your cell phone so that I can't make myself available to you until you decide, NOW you need me, then act as if you've been asking for my help for the last 30 minutes.  #9. Look directly at a price tag and say, "How much is this?"     A. Look directly at the price and ask, "Is this on sale?"     B. Insist that your regularly priced item be given to you for the sale price because you or someone before you put it back in the wrong place.  #8. Throw your payment at me. Credit cards in particular catch great air.  #7. Press your face on the glass to look inside for 5 minutes, without using the extra energy to open the door and come in.  #6. Talk to me through the glass trying to pursuade me to open early or stay late, FOR YOU!      A. Ask me to stay late because, "Don't worry, I just want to look at something?" Wow, since you won't be spending any money, let me unlock that door.  #5. Swear at and threaten the staff. Is this sales person REALLY ruining your life so much you want a mug shot taken?  #4. Get blisters from new shoes and try to return them. ALL NEW SHOES CAUSE BLISTERS! It's called breaking them in, don't be ghetto.  #3. Come in with an attitude anticipating a hassle over a return and throw the merchandise at me, while you treat me as if I, personally, made the item defective. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ME SYMPATHETIC TO YOU!    A. Make up a story about what happened. I smell your lie when you walk in and it only makes my ass harder.  #2. Don't like my answer and ask to speak to the manager. I AM THE MANAGER BITCH!  And the number one MOST obnoxious thing a customer can do;  #1 When asked, "Did anyone help you out today?" Look at your friend/spouse/sugardaddy and say, "He/She did. Do we get a discount?" Followed by lively laughter or a wicked snarl. Do you really think you are the first person to say this to me today? YOU ARE NOT FUNNY!
