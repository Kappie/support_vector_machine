Well I was happy and havin fun when I babysat tonight...I watched Cassie and her friend Kaitlyn. We had fun...they rode bike around and played ball...hide n go seek. All those fun games. It was really alot of fun...Cassie didn't want me to leave...shes so cute. She said "I wish mommy and daddy would never come home cuz I love Terri." So cute. Stuff like that just makes ya feel good. Shes a doll. She wants me to stay over night saturday night...but I dunno...since I'll only get to see 2 of Howard sermons and then hes gone! :( Im sooo gonna cry that day. That will be one of the worst days....*blinks back tears* Eh. Im dumb. If I wasnt the secretaries daughter I wouldnt get so close to them...but I do. Anyways...I left Cassie and got home and Tracy asked me to go camping with her over the 4th. Ross said fine since he had family coming up. Its probably good that I didn't go cuz only thing I hear bout down there is Hawaii this or that. I dunno why it gets to me...it just gets old. Kait said all I talked bout the other weekend was Ross...well all she talked bout was "when Ross and I go to Hawaii this or that" I dunno...just kinda...felt like someone was stomping on my heart. *shrug* But yeah. Im excited bout goin camping with Tracy. It was so much fun last year...even tho we got burnt really bad. LoL. So hopefully we dont peel again...Tho Camy had fun pickin all of our dead skin off...haha. That was interesting...I also caught my first fish last year. WOo...go me! Yeah. So now I don't get to see Ross till July 20th...19th if my mom sets it up *sigh* That means I don't even get to see him on our 1 year anniversary. :( That day will totally suck. *sigh* I guess he'll get his b-day present a month and a half late and his anniversary present a week late...*sigh* I wouldnt care if he didnt get me anything....just to see him would be heaven..but doubt it will happen. Another thing...I dont get to see any of his games...:( stupid weather. *sigh* Makes me sad. I probably wont get my b-day wish either....But if he could come on the 8th -10th Id be happy....Hope he does...otherwise that weekend will really suck. Me alone at home till late hours with nothing to do...no one to be with....*sigh* Oh well...I guess I'll stop complaining...I just had to many emotions inside..and this helped me let them all out....so yeah...later all.
