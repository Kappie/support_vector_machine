So I found the system to look up journals, and found two of them. The third was in the EconP section where they had space-saving bookshelves: they're technically all packed together with just one aisle space between, say, seven rows, and when you want to access a section you have to press a button and all the bookshelves slide. Too bad someone else was in the econ stacks too and I didn't really need it right now so I left. Widener is amazing. Even if you don't have sex in it (according to Harvard lore, one is not a man before he has sex in the library, besides other silly acts) it's one of those places that just leave you in awe because it's just so large. Every time I cross over the Pusey tunnel I feel the weight of three other floors, at least, above me. There's just so many books. I wonder who regulates what's purchased for the library, though some books are so obscure or trivial I like to flip to the back cover to see the last time it was checked out.  I finished  Pale Fire  today. I think the ending made up for all of Kinbote's snobbishness. Wow. But I think people start to get a feel for the ending before it gets there. That's all I'll say, to save the plot for Katy. It's surreal. For some reason it reminds me of Madeleine L'Engle. I guess we're all so obsessed with a particular place or an unparticular place that we forget the imaginary, and so we miss the magic of Zembla and King Charles the Beloved, etc.  Is it weird to be planning out your first day of school?  I'm just sitting here watching my arm twitch. I hope that's not abnormal.
