Here are some updates...lol...  Yeah, I   think   I like Brandon...but I'm so lost and confused...I don't know what to feel anymore...  Volleyball conditioning has started, and it sucks because it's right in the middle of the day...3:30 to 5:30! grr...tryouts are August 9th to the 11th...Debo (our Varsity Coach...also known as Coach Brown), and Coach Golden (our Junior Varsity coach...who is a total grrness!)...yeah they are making cuts this year...so yeah hopefully I will make it...I think I will...but idk...  Yeah man, I can't think of anything else really...I mean I haven't really written much in here anyway, so what's it matter...no one reads these anyways...  So uh yeah...I'm gonna go...lots of love!
