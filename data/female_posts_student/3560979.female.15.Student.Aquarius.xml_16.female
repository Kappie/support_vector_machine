Now that he is in the ARMY and I never see him, I miss him so much. I mean i do get to go see him graduate next week  but after that its him gone for like eight months. Also, with my cat Garf. When I found out she was sick I couldn't stop crying and was with her every second i could. I loved her, but I wish, I had cared for her more when she was alive. Just remember to always tell the ones you love just how much you love them as often as you can. I know I will.  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                        **Stef**
