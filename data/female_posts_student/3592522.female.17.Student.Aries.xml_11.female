The warmness of your ageless eyes  Makes me want to part from the shadows,  and join you in the light of happiness  Where nothing could cause us any pain.   Your lips speak of heartfelt promises  My tongue tells stories of past heartache,  like a helpless bug trapped in your web  I lay my trust in you not to destroy me.   What is left of me I give to you.  Trying to keep a grip on reality  As you bite into me with hungry lust,  bringing me fully into your world of light.
