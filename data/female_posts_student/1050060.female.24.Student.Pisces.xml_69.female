Well that's what happened and I was up like every hour or so. It just is not fair.   Also what is not fair is that I got a crap load of homework to do. I never get much homework and today the professors decided to give a lot. I hardly get any homework in French and he assigned three things to do for Friday. Anyways i am going to go home. Have a good day.
