It's kind of depressing to though, it kind of rubs it in a bit and every one sits at the side pretending that they're having fun! Well they do! Then all this pointless stuff happens and it's like "Oh my God some one tripped up!" and then this big palava happens so every one won't notice that every one's just sitting around the edge going 'Hmm hmmm hm!' Or is it like that...?
