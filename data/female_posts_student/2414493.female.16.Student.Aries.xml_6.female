It's the worst thing on weekends: I go on eating rampages that scour out the refrigerator and the pantry.Well, maybe it's not that extensive but it's enough to make me squirm. It's just not right, I say. And I used to have the logic that ok, I'll eat on weekends and burn it off during the week when I'm so busy I don't have time to eat, but the scale isn't indicating that this particular mindset is working. I've been trying to stave off temptations since Jack in the Box this afternoon with Jess but I just had a piece of cold lotus root.  And I'm back from dinner at grandma's house now. I told myself I'd study physio; it didn't happen. Television is always an attractive aspect.  I miss having long hair. I was looking through YSP pictures and I used to have enough to put it up and have it forking around my neck. I really wonder why I all of a sudden decided that I'd donate it. I mean, it's all right now that it's short because it means shorter showers and shorter blowdrying, but I just miss it. I can't explain why. This whole thing about giving to other people rather than keeping it for yourself is really getting on my nerves. But then I've always been selfish and am not too ashamed to admit it.  I still have "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" stuck in my head. It's such the perfect song for my kind of holiday...mellow, and, in ways, sad. I don't think I ever had the perfect Christmas, but maybe it's being selfish again. Jess says her parents spend about $300 on presents for her, and I'm thinking that Mom and Dad here wouldn't dare do such a thing.  Thinking of which, I wonder what's up with Dad's business and the economy and all. It's kind of humbling to actually pay attention to the fact that Dad's dealings aren't exactly doing swell, and it's probably the first time I've been conscious of it while it was happening. I mean, the whole thing about not being able to go to Harvard for sure is all because Dad says the storage economy still sucks, and I'm being selfish yet again but it used to be, "Sure, you can go to Harvard, no problem." I honestly wouldn't mind having to move out of here into a smaller house because I really don't need all of this space and I don't know how much the house is stretching Dad, but I don't think it's going that poorly just yet. I just hope it improves. I have no idea how hard Dad works, but just seeing him on the weekends makes me realize that it's not all spiffy. I just hope it's not incorrigibly screwed up.  I am always tempted to call those radio stations when they ask ppl to call now to win something, and I finally did today. Not that anyone picked up on the other line. When you're studying physio for a few hours straight listening to 102.7 it gets kind of irritating when every few minutes they give away Disneyland passes. Mind you, I'm not dying for some, but I just gave them a call...5 times straight. Given my coordination and my timidity, I think it's a given that all I got was the busy tone...whatever you technically call that.  Piano lesson tomorrow. I always feel bad when I haven't practiced. Well, I HAVE practiced, but it wasn't assigned music, just the Christmas stuff. God forgive me for being so naive about Excelsior and actually thinking that they'd actually do something different for a change, but needless to say, they didn't.  I miss talking to Nigel. I know most of the time it's just solving each other's problems (mine more than his) but now that he actually has secured Jackie his time's all taken up. I don't blame him though; it's natural and I'm happy that it turned out the way it did. I guess I can't be selfish here. Things will happen when they happen. Oh dear, I remember when I used to have the hugest crush on him in 8th grade, though it's not like I'm ever going to tell him because I feel nothing of it now. I hate crushes. You just spend the whole entire time thinking about them and you know it's not going to happen but you just do it anyways. It's just some demon that pervades your thought processes.  I'm proud of myself that I'm not talking to Ryan at the moment. I actually blocked him last night and got the hugest power trip from it. I don't want to talk, don't want to talk, don't want to talk. It's just something different, I guess. Last year we used to be passionate about the same things and we'd get along so well. Maybe it was just because we both obsessed in the same direction and it just matched up. But now...he's still big into school and doing well (he looked up the AMC results and emailed the page to me last night...he beat me, etc. etc. etc. but I can't believe he's so into that) and youth commission and cynicism and I'm just trying to get away from that all. I'm not saying I've been wholly successful, but there's just things I would have tolerated last year that I can't tolerate in him now. I think it's absolutely normal that people change like this. For the longest time I guess I smelled a rat but I couldn't let myself believe that it was really true and now I realize this more and more every day.  Mind you, I won't tell him, and maybe that's the saddest part of the story. I don't know how he feels about me at this point and I think I can say now without qualms that I really don't care. I mean, most of the time he's just pessimistic and sarcastic and unfeeling, and that's really not what I need now, since I'm going through the same things he is and I want to release my frustration like that but I'm not going to because that's just not my way. At homecoming (another surreal chapter in my life) he was making faces and thinking of rather out of context games and just standing around. I think if he weren't with me I'd dance, but hah, too late now. And I've been tempted to look back and say gee, I shouldn't have implied so much in silence on those baseball field bleachers, but then again, I was just so disillusioned, I guess, that it was better for me not to say anything. I don't think I would have wanted to say anything. It was all so weird, and part of me just screams out that I wish I'd been a little more greedy and asked Nige to take me as a favor to his desperate little sis who only got a date two days before homecoming. I saw him going in with Phyllis, and I was going to see if I could find them, but you know the rest of the story. My biggest regret is that I didn't have a better time. I mean, it was a huge milestone, even though I'm not all too fond of the pomp and circumstance and if you put me in a group with Tiff Hsiou and Lisa Tagliati and Vanessa Kreger, you know who's the odd one out.   But I can't spend so much time regretting. I guess my next step is just to figure out how I can get rid of something etched into everyone's head that Ryan and I go together, because we don't anymore, and now that I've finally come to terms with it it's logical to just erase it out of everybody's heads. I really don't care if he goes to La Reina's winter ball with Pooja, talks politics and dances. I'm not into that kind of thing anymore.  We have absolutely no news for journalism. But maybe it's better that I just handle two pages and resume my rightful role as copy editor, the boringest job on the paper. I'm proud of it! Ugggh.
