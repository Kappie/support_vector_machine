I laughed with the judge--tried to anyway. She complimented my first peice, said I had a really nice grasp of it. She didn't say anything about the horror-plagued sonata. *shudder* I'm actually half-way proud of myself for not mistaking every other measure. It was every other  other  measure. Oh baby.  School is starting to relax a tiny bit, I think. I think it's just because I don't have any tests or papers due  this week , so I get the impression that I have nothing to do. In reality, I have tons to read, research, and write. Then there's everything beyond school... now this piano contest is done, and so is the speech season.  Whoa.  That's two whole things. KB was done a few weeks ago. I'm free! Now all I have is play practice for another two weeks, and then getting things in line for graduation, college, and whatnot. I'm pumped.
