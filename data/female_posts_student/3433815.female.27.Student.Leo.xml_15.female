Even little things; I caught a cold, and it has been a few days do I feel any better, heck no! I have re-started working out (since the hurt back stuff last year), and does it feel any better, NO! I turned my back on a VERY long relationship, do I feel any better, NO. The pain is still there, the anger, the emotions; sadness, weakness, madness... all in one bundle growing inside. And yet I think were did  I  go wrong? what did I ever do in life to hurt like this?          How much time does it take to heal?
