I cut my knee on my desk during english, and it bled all over the place. the teacher asked if i wanted to go to the nurse. uhh, hello! it's just a flesh wound! and... i had math first period, which lasted FOREVER, and we didn't do much there. then there was english, and then lunch, and then PE, and then science. then i went to advisory for thirty minutes and left at 345. and that is my school day. at home i lazied off, felt bad for mellie because she cleaned my room, and it looked SO BAD, and then i did my homework at seven. not much more i can do, because i printer is out of coloured ink, and we have none left in the house. and because i have no one to talk to, i'm just blabbering on about nothingness.. anyway, i'll let it go, and find something else to do.
