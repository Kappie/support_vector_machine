That's about as well as I can sum it up in a sentence. Here's the longer - but still brief - version:  Friday - got out of school at 9 (during Lyceum) - arrived at Kiwanis International at 10 - left Indy in one of two vans (I sat beside Janice... :P) - realized in the middle of our journey that I had brought shorts, but hadn't brought any shoes other than my boots - refused Janice's offer to use her credit card to buy me extra shoes - 2-hour District meeting while in the two vans via walkie-talkie; VERY heated debates - arrived at Recreation Unlimited around 3 in the afternoon - was pelted with hail as Janice ran around, laughing and screaming in joy - tornado was spotted nearby; hid with the rest of the Indy Key Clubbers in a storage closet filled with dishes and Capri Suns; while in hiding I quizzed Janice with her Interdisc flashcards - power went out - improvised and said, "HEY! We have chairs, people, a piano, and Janice. Why not play musical chairs?" - lost dreadfully at musical chairs - ate dinner - power came back on - opening session; was lectured on people's behaviors and how to improve my character; formed teams (I was in the "B Sharps," Janice was part of "The Awesomer-est" group) - went to bed at 12:30  Saturday - got up at 6 (7 their time) - got in the shower - power went out again - took shower in the dark - found another Indy Key Clubber with an extra pair of shoes IN MY SIZE! - cut myself shaving with my crappy razor so that I could wear the shorts :( - went on the challenge course (best part of the trip!) - nicknamed Steph "Treehugger" - Bar-B-Q dinner (blech!) - watched Janice play on the kiddie playground; joined in - evening session; made the "perfect community" - my group did "Athens" and had Japanese stick people shaking hands (with English subtitles, of course!) - walked 10 minutes to a campfire by the lake just to sit for 20 minutes, talk, and come back before curfew - went to bed at 1 in the morning because of an impromptu Indiana District meeting at midnight  Sunday - breakfast - packed - ending session - left Ohio - another hour-long meeting via walkie-talkie - stopped at KFC on the way home, Janice and I bought the $19.99 Picnic Meal (large bucket of chicken, three large sides, six biscuits, and a 1/2 gallon drink, which Janice didn't want and gave to me) and shared it; got strange glances from other customers - District meeting/debate in KFC - spilled half the drink on my lap an hour and a half away from Indy; sat there soaked - drove home  And that was my weekend. Think of if I had not put everything in a bulleted list!  "Happy Towne: a self-sufficient community where the people are fed with the area's sole food source - a giant PopTart."
