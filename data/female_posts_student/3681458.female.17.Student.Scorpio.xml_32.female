We weren't any thing but friends, we could have been more. My sister just used his vunerability to her hormonal advantage. God, I could kick her now for that. I want to hang out with him so much. He was my best friend who helped me through hard times. I wish he was here to help me now. I am not willing to lay it out on the line to be hurt. I don't want to be hurt by him again.   I'm a closed off bitch.  I feel like abitch. Look what's happened to Ben. Gone off the deep end. I'm tired of hearing about him and what he's doing now. It's depressing. He's so different. I feel like I have done it to him. Was everything a lie when I dated him? How much was real? I am sick and tired of wondering these fucking questions. I want to know the truth, even if it hurts. I want to know how much he felt, how much was real, and if he truly meant anything he told me. Was sitting in Jason's car today... after work. and he has a stick shift. I was leaning over exactly how I used to when Ben and I were driving. He would kiss me on my forehead, and say I love you. His hand was on my arm. I could hear his heart. Jason did the same thing. I dont' want everything to remind me of him. I hate him for not meaning any of it, for using me as a pawn.   Megan was at work today. I got her side of the Jay and Katie story which was pretty interesting, since it's the third side of that story that I've heard. She tells me she never sees Ben, but I don't believe her. I think she's lying and doesn't want to tell me. I feel guilty for distrusting her. She keeps so much from me now though.   I don't know what to believe or who to believe.
