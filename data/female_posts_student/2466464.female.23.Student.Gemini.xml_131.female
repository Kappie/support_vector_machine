I might be, I haven't completely put it out of the question. I just don't see anything brilliant about it, I don't feel touched or moved or connected or understood or whatever it is people say they feel when they read poetry. Do lyrics qualify as poetry? I think they should, I'd like some if they did. Mostly I think poetry is for fags, old sigle women, and dashing English professors.  Q: Have you ever memorized a poem to recite to someone? A: No.  Q: Have you ever written or tried to write poetry? A: In my own way, yes. (See post #1) I think simple words can be beautiful, I think fancy words are made to appear beautiful, I think what you do is more important than anything you have to say.  Q: Who's your favorite poet? A: I don't like poetry so I wouldn't have a favorite poet. However, I have read Edgar Allan Poe  DH Lawrence. It's a tie I think.  Q: What's your favorite poem and why? A: Self-pity by DH Lawrence, I like its simplicity.  July 29th  Q: What does "family" mean to you? Do you belong to one? A: Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten. I don't know what "family" means anymore. I love what little is left of the family I once had. I want them to be happy. They suffocate me at times. I love them soo much and I feel that if we're going to live in the same continent we need a bigger one. Yes, I belong to a family. It's little and broken but still good.  Q: Family member you get along with the best? Why? A: My brother Jonathan. Because all of the things he is to me; father figure, best friend, nemesis, ultimate foe, protector, cell mate, savior, hero, inspiration, worst fears, little brother, ultimately my blood.  Q: Family member you'd like to feed to wild dogs? Have a good reason? A: Everyone else. I have good reasons, plenty of them as a matter of fact. I just don't have wild dogs.  Q: Do you include your steady in your family? Are you part of his? A: Yes I do. No I'm not.  Q: Do you believe that "somebody's" gotta wear the pants in the family? A: Yes, me.
