And the loud rock music on my computer. >O  Argh~! I hate this.   Tired, headachey, sticky, hot, hungry... could this be any worse? I wanna go outside but noo my mom wouldn't let me. UghzZ~! We have the playing test tomorrow too! Wtf~ I didn't study. Too lazy to take the saxophone home. Too heavy, too hot, too tired, too lazy. Period. Why'd I have to pick the sax?! Sure, it's fun, but I shoulda taken a nice small instrument! Like... drums! Or... clarinet or flute! Wtf... stupid me. *bonks head*   You know what? I need ice-cream. BUT dinner's gonna be ready soon. Argh~! Soo annoying. My fingers hurt from guitaring and I don't want to touch my guitar now because my hands are sticky from the hotness. Screw it...   Ooooh~ Kent from Friendster added me on his MSN. Gonna talk to him now. Yay~ He saved me from boredom.
