NOPE!  sorry, that's not it.  what does it is ur balls.  havin the balls to look sumone in the eye and tell the truth.  having the balls to say what u want, how u want it and when u want it.  being a man means that u don't play highskool games anymore.  u don't "hint" around, u don't make up dumb excuses.  u just do it!!!!  yes, it's true little boy, ur not a man yet! hahahaha  ps.  this blog isn't ment for the obvious person, so if ur offended by it, call me an i'll tell u who it's ment for... if ur man enuf to ask me that is....hehehe
