Don't  I'm fine  I like hurting  Pain is my friend  It's what I live for  And I won't give that up  No matter what  I love pain  I live for pain  I couldn't survive without it  So don't even try and take it away  I've heard all the excuses  So don't go there  Because I love pain  I live for pain...
