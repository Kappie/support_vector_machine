(yep that got ur attention) not a big one. well, mayb sorta big. next year my mom is moving to china and she says i can cum wit her. i think i mite go cuz i'm really bored with my life rite now. we'd liv in beijing and i'd go to an international school wit other american kids. i'd learn chinese and i'd get all the yummy chinese food i want!!!
