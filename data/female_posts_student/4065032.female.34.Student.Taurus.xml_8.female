The swallows were easy interest targets. They were always there, outside the door, carrying on with the daily rituals. I haven't noticed any other creatures setting up shop outside my door. So I am forced to look elsewhere. Unfortunately, that type of observation takes effort, an effort that I can't seem to find.  However, I have been looking around. What else is a girl to do when her dog is sniffing, exploring, and peeing on every other bush. Like I said before, I am collecting nature details like a kid collects Easter eggs. I haven't paid close attention to each detail, but I still scoop it up and tuck it away for further reflection. Today, I thought I would introduce you to my vast knowledge of trees.  Behind my apartment building, a bike path winds its way through soybean and corn fields. It's paved and is surrounded by cut field grass. Along one particular section, a line of trees have been planted. I'm not able to identify these trees by their scientific name. Instead, there is the tree with the yellow flowers below, the tree with the ribbon tied to a limb, the last tree, the first tree, the tree by the bench...you get the idea. There is also the dead tree.  The dead tree stands about six feet high. It is feeble and brittle, yet it still holds onto its leaves. I'm not sure what its affliction is. An animal, or person perhaps, has been digging at its mulch base. Oddly enough, birds always scratch and poke around for food beneath it. Perhaps they are paying their respects, as I do each time I pass by. My dog, KJ, has "pee"ed on the tree, claiming it for his own. He doesn't seem to mind that the tree is brown. He probably picked it out because it is so different from the others.  I find it interesting that unless you remember to look for the dead tree, you could easily pass by it, not noticing it at all. I guess there are other things in the area that divert attention. Sad, in a way, to be on the edge of life and death and to have an existence so subtle that people need to use effort to take notice. I wonder how long it will endure its fate.  I do know one thing; while the dead tree still stands, KJ and I will take in its fragile worthiness every day. Regardless, everything (or everyone) is worthy of appreciation.
