Being the hippie I somewhat am, I believe it has to do with mankind destroying the ozone layer, melting the polar ice caps, creating the greenhouse effect, making nuclear power plants, forcing the indians off thier land, destroying the rainforests...and I would not be suprised if Barney 'the purple dinosaur' was involved. Its a conspiracy!  Well.. at least this year I have a party to go to. Last year I was going to have some people come over but I got a headache I didnt want to deal with people. So it was just me, my cat, a bag of potato chips and Carson Daly. And despite your company, Carson, (for you really are a lovely host... one painted pinkie and all...) not being a loser much appeals to me this fine new years day. I will ring in the new year with Dick VanDyke, fake champagne, my friends and maybe a boa or two. And, until a get myself a car and (more importantly) a drivers license, that is the best I can do.  Marissa and I were discussing how old we feel the other day. I know, I know...15? How old can you possible feel? Well.. do you realize that a kid born in 1998 is 5 yrs old now? Yes...Yes... suprise suprise! I can do math. But think about it. In just ten short years I will be 25. Its even hard to believe I will be sixteen this summer. God... I'm getting all sentimental! Screw it! Give me the future!! YYYYEEEEE HHHAAAAWW
