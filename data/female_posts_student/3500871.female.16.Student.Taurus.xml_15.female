Now this may not seem like such a big deal, but he just made a pancake about the size of 3 dinner plates AND didn't even save me any. He also airbrushed his pickguard on his guitar black... I told him to paint a portrait of me on there too, but I highly doubt that'll happen. Now the reason why I love Piers so much is not because he's a Pixie or a Leprechaun or that he's really mellow (although all those things are good too). It is simply because he's such a great listener. He's not much of an advice-giver, but when you really need someone to talk to, he's there. For example, I've been telling him about my "issue" with Erin and Kyle and whatnot and he listened to the whole of it (which took me about 30 minutes to explain) and finally said, "So kill them." Just like that. Like, good idea Piers, I'll have a masacre. That'll go over very nicely. But he's great. The end.
