With many laughs, (the entire theater was dying) and a meaningful plot I loved it. The plotline is Cady (pronounced Katie) has been homeschooled her entire life, she starts her first public school when she's 16 and gets a whole lot more than she bargained for. It's a great movie and guys and girls of all ages should see it.   I give it ***** out of 5 stars
