I think her dumb butt did what dedra began to do; click create a BLOG instead of create a post. good grief. im going to have to search out there in blogger land for her. jeeeeezzziiisssss. On a lighter note, im talking to someone new. His name is Lou, and hes a dj on the edge. He gave me his phone number, and told me he wants us to go to putt putt. turns out hes a huge golf fanatic. who knew. (jeez, can i pick em!) Nice harry stuff, code. nice. deege, start reading the blog every day, HAG.
