But I just don't understand and I went to tutorial, I am getting help from my Neighbour, I asked the Chem teacher like a million questions in Chem, and even read over the chapters in my text that we are studying!  I have no idea what else do if and honestly if I could understand I would, but unforntunatly I can't just snap my fingers and understand everything right now.  I've been having lots of irrational thoughts today like suicide and I want them to stop but I am thinking maybe dropping Chem would be my best option right now, but how could I even do that.  I would kill my dream of being a Science Teacher or a Bio Major (Biology Teacher) and well I need Chem to do the things I want to do.  And I  *CAN'T*  kill my dream, if I were to ruin that it would be like some one stabbing a knife into my heart, and the thought that is demeaning.  I can't image doing anything else but teaching and I know in my heart that is what I life and breath for.  If I would drop Chem or fail I just don't know where my place in life is, it would feel as if there is no place and no reason for my being here.  I know suicide is wrong but sometimes it feels like nothing will even work out and I cry for what seems like forever wondering WHY??...Why can't God understand how much my dream means to me and how hard I am working to try understand.  Why can't God help me and WHY isn't there an answere to why I just don't understand things as good as everyone else??  I just wish there were someone to hug right now, it sounds silly but I wish someone could just understand what I am feeling and look into my eyes and see how much I am hurting.  I wish sometimes things would get better and I hope they do.
