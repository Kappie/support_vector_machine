I wanted to be pu tin for higher listening and foundation reading...but he thought I was really good at reading. Now he'll know, I SUCK!! Ah well, a game of footy tonight and a "end of exmas" celebration on Sunday with plenty of alcohol and my favourite lame-ass lads ^.^ YAYYYYY (even though my last exam isn't til next week...but shhhh!)
