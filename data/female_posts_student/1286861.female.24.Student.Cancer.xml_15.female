Me.  -Unemployed -Happy to not be working where I was -Hopeful to find a new job I will like -Without a car -Sad that I have to be dependant on others to get me places -Not happy being single -Sad that I am not happy being single, I should be happy  -Love being back in theatre -Sad that I am not getting paid for working the theatre I love -Very upset at my pancreas and other random bodily organs -Wondering what life will bring me next  I am a list person. I wanted to list some current feelings and problems in hopes of getting them out and taken care of. This is supposedly healthy. Either I will be better or more people will make fun of me. We will find out.   There are a couple possibilities for new jobs already. Cross your fingers for me. If anyone needs a cute redheaded assistant, just let me know. I will try and find one.
