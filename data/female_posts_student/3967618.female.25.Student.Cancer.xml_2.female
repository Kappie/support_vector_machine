Its really beautiful over there--lots of really old big trees and modest houses.  I think: wouldn't it be nice to teach at Ypsi High when I graduate next year and buy a funky house in that area.  But then it occurs to me that the kids I teach will find out where I live and egg my house.  Oh well, it adds excitement to life. I've also been enjoying riding my bike up Huron--man those houses are amazing.  The thing thats funny is in one block, it turns really scary.  The e-way does it, I think.
