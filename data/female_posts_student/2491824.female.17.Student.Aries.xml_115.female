Two years ago, David and I were bored and talking online... He said something about boobs, and I told him how much I hate them and asked if he wanted them... He did. ...From that point on, he has been the sole owner of my boobs.. (Well, I suppose they are not really my boobs anymore...) ...And one day at lunch someone suggested that, since they belong to him, he should help me take care of them.. Or something like that.  He said he is going to take the bra into his art class to put something on it before he gives it to me... (I think his art class is printmaking...He might have another one also..) ...He showed me a print that he wanted to put on it...  Actually, it's kind of similar to the picture above this.. If I remember correctly, the print is of a stick-figurish head wearing headphones...   Hehe... I can't wait...   Oh! What are you doing on Saturday?! What?... That's crap! Don't do that.. Go see me in  Actor's Nightmare  at the Fine Arts Fesival at 4:20... (Yes, we already performed it once, but since we won the One-Acts, we have to do it again..) It'll be good...
