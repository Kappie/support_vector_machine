That's a fact.  Well lots of stuff has happened. Yesterday I went to babysit. Veda is gone for a few weeks, so this lady, Rita, was helping out. I'd heard her on the phone, and thought she was Jamacian, but found out that she is Indian. Anyways, we somehow end up talking about her eighth grade daughter and how messed up she is. She wanted to start shaving her armpits, and eventually worked her way down to an area I'm not going to name. Now Rita, I just met you, why the hell are you telling me this?! Then she asked me my grades, and my math grade, I mean why doesn't she just transform into my father and kill me. Then I went shopping for my college visits. Note to self: never go spend $300 running on two poptarts and some milk. You must stay hydrated, it's key to a successful shopping experience. I thought I was going to die afterwards, so I went home and then to a movie. I saw Secret Window, it was good. Go see it. Johnny Depp, 'nough said.  Today was CRAZY! I went to see the Early November show. I met Elizabeth there at 1:30, I know, the show was at 7. We walked around a lot and experienced campus life. OSU- not for me. We headed behind the theater at about 3. We met Joe, Sergio, and the oh-so-beautiful ACE, back there. They were really nice. All except Jeff, who despite my constant badgering, had no interest. Bastard. Then we headed towards the line. I'd seen two girls there earlier, but now they were gone. WE WERE FIRST IN LINE. For some reason, it felt like a really big deal. All of a sudden these other two girls come up to us. For one, as bad as it is, all I could think was "moley moley moley". They stared at us for literally several minutes. I finally was just like "what?!" They told us that they were asked to put up fliers and they wanted their spots back. I was all no way Jose, but the staring and glaring would not end, so I was like "fine take the damn spots, JUST TAKE THEM!" It was awkward the rest of the four hour wait. Some good stuff happened though. The first two girls I saw came back, and we ended up talking a lot. We were really similar, and it was fun to share different concert stories. All of a sudden these college guys come up and ask us if we wanted to be in a video survey. We said okay, and then they began to ask us healthcare questions and so on. Then he goes, "So if you messed up your arm, and the doctors could amputate it for $70,000 with three days in the hospital, would you take that or try a $70 maggot treatment?" WHAT?!?!?!?! They kept asking us what maggots looked like and every other question you could ask about a maggot. Then they had one of the guys kneel on the ground, and they go, "Pretend he's a maggot, what would you do to get him to go away?" Elizabeth and this other girl poked him, but I swatted him and shouted "shoo get away!" AHHHH MAGGOTS! Ace came around again, and I got a picture with him. It was really hot. He put his arm around me, and afterwards instead of just pulling it away, he dragged his hand across my back towards him. I am drooling at the thought of his beautiful face. He cut his hair, I like it a lot more. The first band Limerick or some shit was a little folky, but still good. I really liked Spitalfield. First off, that name is kickin. One guy, TJ or DJ or something, was ADORABLE. I fell in love with him. He was hot. Hey Mercedes was obnoxious. Early November was VERY VERY VERY GOOD! I like them a lot. I want to have Ace's baby, without having a baby. For their encore they played, "I want to hear you sad" I LOVE THAT SONG! I screamed really loud. It made me think of Yellowcard at Warped Tour and how loud I screamed for "October Nights". Good times all around.  Now I am very tired and my ears are ringing. I won't post for awhile, since I'm headed towards Boston, NYC, and DC for college visiting. Wish me luck.... byeeee! PS I miss my Unies, I hope you guys are having a good spring break!
