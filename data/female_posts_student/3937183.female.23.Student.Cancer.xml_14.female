I went to town with a mission but got too excited when I thought of sending moi darling an MMS. KAAKAKAK! Met up with Veron and partner as well as Min at Takashimaya… I got a free ride from mum since she was heading town too but she let me off at Scotts because she was only going there… I walked all the way to Taka and was already quite tired liao. They were waiting for me at a secluded area off the side of the department store on the first floor. HEE! They did rebonding today and so I expected their hair to look BIAN! Super bian! AKAKAKAKKAKAK!!    We proceed to Watsons to get some gel that Min wanted to get since long ago… Shall wait for results to be shown. Blab! I did not intend to have dinner cause I had lunch at 2pm and was still full but Veron and partner were hungry already so we decided to cross over to Paragon and eat jiao zi!!! Moi favourite but too bad, Veron don’t like to eat jiao zi! We then decided to eat Spaghetti instead. I ordered a meatball spaghetti and shared a chicken Caesar salad with Min. The meatballs were good but I had no appetite due to the exploding excitement building up in me as I had already decided to send a MMS I took using Verons’ new mobile phone. When they were still munching away, I was taking shots!!! I took a few and kinda gave up because I looked so ugly…. Shown them 1 which can see the whole of my head and they all encourage me to send that…. FIAK! Anyway, I sent a lot of failure MMS to myself and wasted a lot of MMS… WASTE MONEY!!!    After settling the bill, we went to lucky plaza because Veron needed to change some Malaysian currency as she was going Genting today. I was still pondering about sending the MMS man… Then there was this sudden urge of sending so I DID! I DID!!! I wrote some words and then I pressed send… KAOZ! You can’t imagine how fucking nervous and tensed up I was… INTENSED! Couple of mins later, I received a reply from darling and guess what he said;    “baby!! Omg!! Muack!!! Ty honey!! I am so surprised!! Silly ger, u looked totally fine! Oh gosh… I’m lost 4 words… I luv u honey!”    KAKKAKAKAKK! I laughed and showed Min the message and she gave me a grin look! Hiak! We decided to walk on to Heeren and I am still rather nervous actually… Haiz… I was thinking lucky he did not say I am ugly man… While browsing in one of the shop, I received a call from darling saying that he was so surprised to receive a MMS from me… Hurhur! We spoke a little while and hang up as he was still working. Mins later he called again with this really excited tone!! He said he was looking at me when suddenly he feels that I look like someone and after some thoughts, he finally see me as a resemblance to CHRISTY CHUNG!! I was like WTF!!!! I am so fat and ugly!! How could I look like CHRISTY CHUNG!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAK!! Well… still I was very honoured and happy because he find me beautiful! Hurhur!!    We got out of Heeren and decided to walk to Parklane as both Min and me wanted to shed some fats… Veron followed unknowingly till we reached Plaza Singapura and she asked where are we going. We laughed and said Parklane. Lets play some pool at this new and nice place that is near Mr. Bean. She refused to play pool and so she left with partner while Min and me continue our walk. Min asked if we wanna walk on till we are so tired then get on a cab and I was indeed, in a walking mood! I agreed and we continue walking the whole stretch of Little India. I don‘t really feel comfortable at all as those stupid black skin men keep staring at me… I felt intimidated by their stares and worse of all; I don’t understand a single shit that they spoke! PUI! Those idiots were giving me stares like they were removing my clothes with their bare eyes! Anyway, we just took precaution as we walked on… Damn fucking tired already…. We were chatting while walking so its not that bad after all… Time flies when we are so engrossed in reaching our destination; MINS’ HOUSE!!! WTF! It took us 2 hrs to reached Balestier from Orchard man!! I was dead tired and thirsty! Got on a cab as soon as Min reached home! At that time, I took out my phone and saw 3 missed calls. Darling must be worried sick as I did not managed to pick up. I called him and told him I was too busy walking and also, I couldn’t be bothered to even take my phone out. HURHUR!!!    Reached home around 11.30 and was asking Wendy how do I looked in that MMS that I’ve sent and she said I looked good… Fine then, I shall believe I do looked good despite the fact that I think I looked ugly… Haiz! I took my shower and was waiting patiently for moi darling to call. Hee! At 2.15am, darling finally called and I was so happy! We chatted for a while and he have to go back to work le. I had this urge to call Eddie and chat up with him as I think he is still a friend after all… I seek my darlings’ permission and he was a little reluctant but thought that it’s really all right so I went ahead.    I dialed Eddies’ nos and was waiting for him to pick up. It took quite a while and he finally picked up my call and said, “Oh hi, din expect you to call, can I call you back?” I said, “okie, go head with your things.” He called back shortly and told me he was rather busy and we started talking. Strange enough, he don’t sound like he used to be and there was this occasion that he put me on hold and got back with a softer tone. What comes to my mind immediately was he had connected our conversation with a third party perhaps and worse come to worst, there might be more than just a third party…. Well, I did not care, as I believe so that I had nothing to hide in the first place so, I just behaved normally and continue chatting…. He asked several weird questions like; do you have a boyfriend now? Where do you know him? Do I know him? Does he use a sate? WEIRD!! He knew that I am with moi darling since day 1 but why asked these questions???? FUCK CARE! We finished our conversation as soon as I received a call from darling.    Well, darling and I was really shocked and ambiguous towards all these nonsense that these people were doing and talking about… It’s also true that we did not choose to hide anything but just that no one approached us about what is going on. They created stories, rumors, gossips and all with their slightest imagination. HAIZ! Well, there is this Chinese saying, “Qing zhe zi qing”. So long we are innocent and we did not do anything wrong, there is nothing worth racking our brains over such issues. Hee!! Oh, btw, I did a funny thing, I sent a 2nd MMS to my darling!!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAKAKKAKA!!! DAMN FUCKING UGLY!! He claimed he like the last pic most! Weird! I think I looked ugliest there…. BLAB!!!    Well, I have to undergo an intensive weight losing program man! People please wish me luck! Jess needs support from you guys! Muack!!!! Another long long blog… I am so fucking chiong hei!!   Kisskiss!
