It’s the 2nd time that I’ve wished Bastian before WH. Bleah. Nonetheless, it's wonderful that I’m still WH’s dearest friend. YZ left me a note last Monday that I was her best friend. Though I was pleased, it doesn’t really matter how many people regard me as their best friend, but it matters whether my dearest friend still regards me as hers!         My friends’ joy is the best 'thank you' I can get. I don’t want presents in return. I just want them to spread their joy to others. Likewise, God doesn’t want us to return His grace with sacrifices or adherence to rigid laws like circumcision or fasting. He does, however, want us to spread his love to those around us.
