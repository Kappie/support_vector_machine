Saturday I ATE too much again and went to the Chuck Wagons and Outdoor Show - that was exciting and my some gift of God I have managed to eat like a cow (wait a min...cows eat grass...lol) and gain NO weight - scary, but it's a good thing. Then Monday we had a substitutefor Summer School (not like I haven't seen enough of those in my lifetime) , but I liked him a lot. He was pretty good, maybe even a bit betterat explaining things. Then during that night I picked up Chels and Andy and went to the Teen Night thing out here cause it' fun and something to do - Even though I have too many hours of homework. However, like two minutes after getting there we got rained out so we went back to my house. I ate dinnerand then we played Catopoly. Later on it stopped raining and walked back up the the teen night. We made shirts again this year that say: South Side Gals, and then our nicknames on the back. They also have a karokee system this year, and we are having an 80's night where we all have to come dresses as someone from the 80s and everything, with 80's karokee. Oh, I am so excited. Chels and I am OBSESSED with the 80's!! That was the coolest decade ever!!!   Today I got my mid-term report for Social 30. 78%!!!!!!! How did I manage that one. I like practically failed half of my tests and quizzes. I even beat the guy from St. Marys on the average. By the sound of it I also beat everyone on their essays. Everyone was like oh...50, 60...I got 81!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyways, that is all I can write. I am a busy gal. Gotta study tonight and go out right now!! So long...
