I go to the mall cuz im in the mood to see hot Hot Topic dudes, and did i? nope, didnt even go in the freakin store haha i wasnt feeling all that great, so i didnt. I went to Dillards to help dad pick out a tie and then to Walmart where i bought some more blank cds to make more illegal cds out of! yay for me. And then...we went to Diary Queen. i got a small cherry sundae and before i could eve pick it up off the counter i got it everywhere..and i mean everywhere, see the chick that made it overfilled the damn thing, so this red cherry shit was running everywhere and this dude was the one up front that we paid and hes like laughin at me cuz im tryin to clean it up and make it stop. lol not fun..i was like "ughhh" and laughin at myself and he just stood there watching laughin at me. thanks a lot dude, i should have just poured it out on the counter and let ur minium wage ass clean it up. but i tried my best to make as little as a mess as possiable but u must have found it freakin funny. ugh. lol ok...anyways, im offically coming home july 17th. i told my dad. i did make up another story though about how i needed to get my stuff for school together during that week since i wont be able to the next week because the dr will make me stay off my knee before surgery..well, he thinks my pre-op is monday, its really friday as we all know. ok..so i lied..i lied cuz i didnt wanna hurt his feelings and i NEED to go home and get my stuff for school ready (no lie) and see my friends because if i wait another week they'll all be gone to the bahamas (no lie) and i need to get my GCB/OAR tickets (totally not a lie), and i need to get wasted and hang out with people who i have no idea who the fuck they are! which is totally fun. (no lie) haha sooo..when u weigh out the lies and the non-lies, the non-lies win, so i guess in all reality i didnt lie. haha go me!   *much love and that sexy mr. roger's sweater*
