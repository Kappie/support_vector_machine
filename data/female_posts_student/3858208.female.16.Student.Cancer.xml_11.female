I sat straight up in bed and pinned Zues down so I could look at his  green  front paw. It looked like he stepped in somebody's green hair dye. Then I noticed that the tip of his ear and the fur around his mouth was also green. Hmm...I flipped over and hung off the edge of the bed so I could look under it. Aha! Mystery solved - there was [what was left of] a pen under the bed, his favorite spot to chew up stuff he isn't supposed to have. Apparently, sometime during the night, he found my pen and decided to eat it. He chewed up the end, causing ink to spill all over his paw, as well as rub off onto his jaw where he was chewing on it. Still not sure how he managed to get it on his ear, though.   Speaking of Zeus, Chels and I were playing with the dogs earlier and we trapped Zeus on the chair by building a fort around him, but he managed to get out (his middle name is Houdini for a reason). Then we built a huge tower out of the couch cushions (the sofa bed is out right now), the cushion from the chair, and three bed pillows, on  top  of the bed, and then put Zeus's Legless frog (it really is a stuffed frog w/o legs; the dogs pulled them all out) on top of the whole thing. Eventually he tried climbing to the top but in the end he just succeeded in knocking the entire thing over on himself. It was funny as hell; I laughed for almost twenty minutes because the whole time he was attempting to get it, Scarlet was lunging at the tower trying to make it fall so  she  could have Legless. It was great.      RIGHT NOW     mood ::  happy  listening to/watching ::  nothing *shock!*  eating/drinking ::  Vanilla Coke  craving ::  a certain somebody  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  my dogs  wishing ::  nothing, at the moment  wearing ::  jeans  a t-shirt  random ::  I chew sugarless gum.
