In fact, i think i can safely say that was the worst exam i have ever taken in my entire life. Ah well, resits are fun! Hmm...even funner (is that a word?) day tomorrow....double chemistry in the mornin then history! Oh yay. But thats the end then! Wooooooooo! And then i get to go back to school. Life's just a bundle of fun. Woohoo.
