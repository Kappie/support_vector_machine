[i always wonder: doesnt "traveling" have two "l's" or is it really just one??] anyways. i also brought my pillow that i made in home ec. and lay there on the mat chillin to my evanescence music. i was feeling a bit anti-social. or maybe i was just pissed off. or well i wouldn't call it pissed off. just, well, perhpas i could call it peeved? whatever. i was just feeling anti-social. social outcast? perhaps. i dont particularly like people. i am more of an introvert person. i feel that i dont fit in in large groups. im not really one to like crowds. maybe thats just when im feeling moods like this one. coz usually, i like to be around people. im comfortable aroudn people. if im in the right mood, i LOVE being the centre of attention. oh yes, indeed. i love it.  ok. thats enough rambling on about crap. i think i'll end this blog now. *presses publish post* [ooh alliteration!!] *smacks head coz i am a retard*
