I am thinking that making my dad something should likely come next because we are mailing that before we go out to dinner, which by the way is going to suck and I don't want to go. My back is incredibly sore and Kirsti didn't show up on her lunch. Grr...I'm sure I will see her later then. Still haven't written to Erin so that is not good. I will have to write her tomorrow which will actually be interesting because my mum will be home all day with me so there will be a lot less in the way of posts because she hates the sound of typing for some reason. And we have a loud keyboard.  So that is my life for the day, I have things to do so right after I post some lyrics (just because I feel like it!) and a poem I wrote, I will get to doing some stuff.  To the Dancer in the Rain ~Emilie Simon I didn't believe in anyone  but I found you today my eyes are now closed babe as to remember if my words are not that clear I know my heart is understanding every little kiss of you. I'm your princess for a night maybe forever we were dancers in the rain  and it still remains if my words are not that clear I know my heart is understanding every little kiss of you.   I let my mind drift and for some reason  it always finds you across time, galaxies whatever the path brings quantum leaps over mountains and canyons it stops at nothing I stop at nothing just for a glimpse of the flawed perfection I find in you. ~by me  see like I promised I am going now to do stuff. I have wasted enough time here today. Ooh, one more thing, I was watching Last Comic Standing last night and there was this guy on there and his joke was "I work at Bed, Bathroom and Beyond. I work in the Beyond department." I thought it was really funny because I feel like I belong in the Beyond department somewhere. Its probably more fun than the other two anyway.
