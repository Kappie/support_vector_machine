How does someone sleep for an hour and a half on a Friday evening, wait till like 1 and then turn around and sleep 11 more hours?  This is surprising even for me.  At like 12:30, I took a shower and got probably the worst shaving cut of my life.  It was awful.  I lost a lot of blood.  Then, right on cue, my mom comes to the house and knocks on the door and is like, "I just came to wish you a happy Valentine's Day.  I brought candy!  Can I come in?"  Oy. Me: "Mom, this is not really a good time." Mom: "Oh, but I wanted to give you your valentine." Me: "Fine!  Come in." (covering myself) Mom: "Ooooh, that's a nasty cut you've got there." Me: "Yeah, yeah, it is." Mom: "You should really be more careful." Me:    Mom: "Oh, but if you elevate it for like ten minutes, I bet it'll be ok." Dad, in the background: "Hey, what time are you supposed to be at your friend's house?"  (Since when was he home???) Mom: "Like 2:30, I think.  I'm picking her up at 4 to go to Shelly Lake." Dad: "You're going to Shelly Lake?" Me, in my head:  AHHHHH, GO AWAY!  This is not the time to bond, over my battle wound.  I'm not even dressed.  I'm fucking dying in here!!!  Why doesn't everyone ever just come on in my bathroom? Mom: "Yeah.  That reminds me, do you have a ride home?" Me: "I don't even know." Mom: "Oh, well, I brought the cell phone, and it's all charged.  I gotta go, I have a hair appointment.  Happy Valentine's Day, love!"  (kisses me on the cheek) Me:           (not returning the sentiment) Then, she closed the door, and I heard her talking to my dad. When she knocked on my door another time, I simply said, "BYE, Mom!" I limped out of the bathroom, put on a cd, and elevated the wound, as my dearest mother suggested.  Not two minutes later, my dad shouts to me, "Hey, when you get a minute, I need your help outside."  Oh, what fresh hell is this? I got up and dressed the wound, and myself, and hobbled outside.  My dad was trying to jump start the Saab from the Toyota. "Just get in the Toyota, and pressure the gas."  Yessir. No such luck, the battery was just too dead.  Can't say I'm surprised.  The poor little Saab has been awfully neglected.  No one ever drives it.  When I told my dad this, he just gave me a look.  XO to you too, Dad. I went back inside, laughing to myself about this whole situation, and how much happened in the hour and a half that I've been awake.  Wow.  I had to save this, and what better way than to share it with everyone on the World Wide Web?  So, I sat down and typed the whole thing.  Wow. Well, I have to get ready to face the rest of the day.
