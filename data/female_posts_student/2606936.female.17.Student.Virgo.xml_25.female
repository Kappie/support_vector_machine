Unfortunately, it's happening again.  NUmber one - on Valentine's Day (VALENTINE'S DAY!) I received a call at ten-of-ten PM (on VALENTINE'S DAY!) from the Schnig. (Did i mention this was Valentine's Day?" Who wants to receive a call from an ex-bf on "VD," especially when they have recently discovered unpretty suspicions about said ex-bf are true, cementing a resolve to never again exist on civil terms with said ex-bf?)  (Not I.)  The conversation wasn't much. Here's the rundown. I answered it despite caller ID because I was afraid he would leave a message, adding to the twenty or so i already have of him that i'm afraid to delete bc I'll ahve to listen to him talking about how much he LOOOOOOVED me at 12:47 AM Saturday, August Blah. But to get to the interesting part....  Audrey: Hello. The Schnig: Hi. A: ..... who's this? TS: um..... it's [NAME]. A: ....oh. ..... hi. TS: Um. Is it, like, too late to call, or do you not want to talk to me, or.....? A: ..... ....... ...... I don't especially wanna talk to you. TS: *sighs* Ok. ......... well, bye. A: *hangs up*  Eu. Icy, I am. I refuse to say what all went down, but he deserves it from me... but anyways.  So all that funkiness notwithstanding (VALENTINE'S DAY?!?!?!?), a new problem has arisen.  In that I may have thought I had a crush on someone who turns out to like me a whole lot, where I don't think i reciprocate, and yet I cannot stop flirting with him.  If this is followable, without names, I do this a lot when single..... I generate small amounts of interest, flirt a little, and end up with guys who think they are in LURV and major guilt. I'm a repentant serial heartbreaker. Ask a friend....  So it's like the real, nice Audrey is hiding from the reality - that she may be leading someone to care about her. And that she doesn't REALLY "requite" this.   And she is hiding from the fact that she could probably stop it, if she would only face up.  But the real, nice Audrey is a wuss. Which is why I can be a "cold ice queen." * I let my id rule my superego and end up wondering why I suck.  * Great story..... he said something like, "Well, you can't just be a..... I'm sorry for saying this..... a.... cold ice queen! There, I said it, and I'm sorry for being so..... mean....."  and i believed his innocence and honesty.  NICE AUDREY, you are a sucker.
