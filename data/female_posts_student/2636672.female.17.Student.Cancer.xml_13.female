I suppose i'll figure out this blog thing by just clicking on things...and hoping it does something..;)! so aynways. once i get this thing tamed, and under control i might actually have posts on here that are actually WORTH reading, but until then...you'll have to bear with me.   So Expage...it works. but not well...it has a limit as to how long a dang page can be :(. not good...at least not for talkative people like me :). So i'll keep that one...just 'cause people know about it. but i have a feeling that this will satisfy me WAY MORE! which is GREAT. umm yeh. so still working on it. until then...SORRY!  -tori
