It was a usual Saturday, waking up 10 minutes before work starts and crawling around the shop until lunchtime where I had a break for an hour then returned to crawling around like a dozy bee at the begining of summer.  However there was no dreaded mrs.p, I think with the welcome she recieved last week she wont be appearing for a while.  I love working in a shop, it's the customers that make it horrible (apart from the odd cute baby)  I hung around expecting a visit and a text at least but still I got none apart from the ever-loyal nat and louise...no chomp this time Nat, I'm dissappointed!  It's good to feel wanted...son't you agree?  Argh I'm getting into a state of self-pity now, stop it!  Well my Saturday night will be spent in front of the computer and tv instead of in front of a cinema screen, the way I would have liked it, with someone close to me, but alas it isn't meant to be.  Ah well boo fucking hoo...least I'm fully aware of the difference between wanted and taken for granted
