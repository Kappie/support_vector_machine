Oh wow, I haven't written since I was at Larissa's last... and I don't know where to start so I will start with last night!      Okay, so last night I get a phone call...It's Blake telling me to look out my window. And I look out and Brandon and him are out in Brandon's truck waiting for me! So I went out there and me and Blake fought over who had to sit in the back...so we both just sat in the front...so me and him and Brandon all made our way to TACO BELL where they got some food and i watched over the truck. Then on the way to Callie's Brandon's truck ran out of GAS!!! SO we had to pull over into some scary apartment complex and wait for the wonderful Amy to bring us gas! So as we were waiting we decided to listen to music, not realizing that it was running the battery out. So when Amy delivered the gas we were all ready to go then of course the truck wouldn't start...we had run the battery out! So we had to wait for them to come back and jump start the truck...then we were FINALLY ON OUR WAY!! By this time we had to go get Audre and Kristy...   We waited for them for awhile then we deciced to drive over and get them, and Blake and Kristy jumped into the truck quicker than I did... and Brandon drove off not knowing I was only half way in!!! i tried to pull myself up then I fell backwards and hit my head super hard on the concrete, it was bleeding and I have a big ol' bump...not to mention I was spitting Blood when I got home!!!! My sister was scared I was going to die so she woke me up every 2 hours! But anyway......I have never seen Blake and Brandon laugh that hard in my life, it was pretty funny although I was in a shit load of pain. After that we went to callie's to give her money. Then we were off to take me home, and about 20 minutes had passed since I fell and Blake and Brandon were still freaking laughing, it really wasn't THAT funny. But I'm glad I made them laugh? Oh well good times with those boys I guess...      Today, well today was pretty boring...Until now of course!!! My favoritest AND BESTEST friend is here for the night..................BRIANNEY BANANNY!!!!!!!   Her and I are going to sleep in the tent tonight, like I did last night...that is how I didn't get cought if you were wondering! Oh yes and me and her are going to do some reading tonight as well!!
