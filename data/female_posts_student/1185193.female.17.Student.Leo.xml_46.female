Good news is though, she (the boss) said that she is prepared to offer me a position today.  Hooray!    Updates coming...   UPDATE   I got the job!!!!  Woohoo! I start next Tuesday :) However, I did forget to ask a really important question--how much money I'll be making.  Anyways, I am off to go shopping for new work apparel!  Hooray for Megan!
