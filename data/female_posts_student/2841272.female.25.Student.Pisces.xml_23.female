I am thinking of keeping the focus on actors, actresses, writers and directors, but if you think of someone or something outside of my focus areas please feel free to express them. I will be leaving Charlie Kaufman off my over-rated list so I hope he won't appear on your under-rated list. I think sometime in the future we might need to spend a whole topic on Kaufman, maybe not ten posts, but I think we could definitely cover the topic in six posts. I look forward to seeing what you have to say.
