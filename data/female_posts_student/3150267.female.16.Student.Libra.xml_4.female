Even when we are down, we should not feel sad... instead, look at the bright side... i m sure that ur life have not reached the bottom (at least u have something which some ppl don't have)... Instead of changing an environment to feel better, i believe that maybe we should change the way we look at it... ^_^ I think i m talking crap here... but ppl... enjoy ur life... we don't have a lot of decades to spend here... haha... Love urself n love everyone around u... ^_^ happiness doesn't pop out on it's own... it's hiding for u to find it n realise the importance of it... when u r physically hurt, u will then realise how gd it is to be well... when u had a fall, u will then realise how easy it was for u to walk last time... Let our hearts be filled with joy n love... let us forget all those unhappy things... n wish for a better day tml.. ^_________^ God bless...       ::I still believe that after every storm eventually a rainbow appears...::
