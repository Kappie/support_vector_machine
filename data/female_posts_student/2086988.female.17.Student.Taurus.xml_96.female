Didn't make freaking varsity theatre, I basically gave up 2 years for nothing...oh well, something good will come from all of this.  so  there's alot of people I can't stand, those who overshadow others and always have to be the center of ATTENTION. I just don't care anymore...But anyways, things are looking good for being on the North Stars. They need about 40 girls for the team, so hopefully I'll make it and Ms. Gibson is so totally awesome.   Wow, I just got done laughing for about 30 min, I got called EMO!!!!!!!!!!! ahahahaha my life is now complete, I can die happy!   so we danced on the floor and around
