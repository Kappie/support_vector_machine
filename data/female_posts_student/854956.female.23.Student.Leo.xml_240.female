They're having a store closing b/c they're moving to Rolling Oaks Mall. Then we looked around the rest of the store a bit. It was nice to spend some time with Jennifer... at first she told me I was acting like a bored boyfriend... but I have to ease into shopping. Especially if there's a crowded store b/c of a major sale. Jennifer wanted to throw her gum wrapper at some innocent little boy. After he had been sitting there awhile, he was getting bored waiting for his Mom. So, he got his socks (which I guess were for the new schoolyear), and started making them fight. Jennifer was like, "OOOOOH! Sock monsters!" He looked up a sec, and then put the socks down. I think she was freaking him out. At one point, he dropped all his clothes off the prop bed (we were sitting on a prop bed alsowaiting for Lenny) and Jennifer let out a HUGE burst of laughter... from what I remember, it was in relation to something she said... but the little guy thought it was from him dropping his clothes. His little cheeks turned red, and he quickly picked up the clothes, and then hung his head in embarassment. It really was rather entertaining for 15 minutes. Then we went over and Jennifer looked at some beds b/c she wants a new one... Not one salesperson came over to inquire about helping us... I think it's cause they thought we were a lesbian couple looking for a new bed. But, who knows for sure...Lenny got there, and then we went and paid for our stuff. After we were done I called my Mom and had her call in the order to Grant St. I went and picked up the pizza... and it was so delicious! Me and my Mom are now STUFFED... so I'm gonna go finish vegging with her in front of the TV. :-) Laters...
