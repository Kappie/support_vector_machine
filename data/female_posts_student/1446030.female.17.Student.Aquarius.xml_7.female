I guess we became much closer after that incident...But i'm actually angry with DayangCONG. He shouldn't have said those things to hurt her...although i'm more siding towards her, what he said is far too overboard. Hu is he to sae someone a bitch? Doesn't he knows that she is a very pessimistic person? What he said will be extremely hurtful to her unlike ordinary people like me. My heart ached when i talked to her..she seemed so depressed when she read DayangCONG's blog. I felt like crying...but my sister is around. He doesn't know that, by hurting her..he's oso inflicting 10 times the pain onto me...MEAN guy. But then, thanks to him, She cherishes me as her BELOVED friend. so happy. I finally made it clear that no matter what, i'm always there for her. She finally notices me. Finally thinks i'm important to her. Anyway, i'm happy that she thinks i'm important to her. Stupid DayangCONG! Bully her again lar...u watch out
