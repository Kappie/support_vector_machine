Also going to be blogging less because my roommate's computer crashed, and my internet connection from home is dependent upon hers.  So for now, it's just from school for me, and as I'm trying to be more productive at school...let's just say, if you don't hear from me, never fear...I shall return soon enough (perhaps too soon for the likes of many of you).
