CSM the most bestest god camp!   alrighty i went swimming with my rad cuz eileen on friday! i saw her alot this weekend. anyway there was this crazy kid who was like crawling under our chairs and stuff. man it was cool! the she was telling me about the racistness at her family picnics! here grandpa calls them spicknics cause her fam is PR.(delilah) uh then i went to dinner with my rents at shadow lake. that was okay i guess. but my dad was hammered! it was kinda funny.  saturday we went to a red wings game. eileen came with us! man there was this crazy guy there yelling at the ump and it was funny. he just kept yelling!  then we watched the fireworks and sang along with the songs we knew. uh then i went home and watched viva la bam and jackass!  so uh yeah... this song is for you,for you, for you and your mom. cause she likes to listen too!  HIM Sweet Pandemonium  Today tomorrow seems so far away And the wait in vain, yeah So safe, in the blinding light of love unchained In yesterday's grave, yeah  The truth that could set souls free Is buried within sweet pandemonium Concealed by disbelief The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  Afraid that everything remains unchanged In this fragile dream, yeah Ashamed of the shattered remains Of promises made, yeah  The truth that could set souls free Is buried within sweet pandemonium Concealed by disbelief The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  Drained by the anger and grief Fazed by the envy and greed  The secret cries for a release The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium  The truth that could set souls free Is buried within sweet pandemonium Concealed by disbelief The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  so i really like that song! later days          MEH
