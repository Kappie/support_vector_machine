Found out that one of my friends is going through a very difficult time. I promise you, I am ALWAYS here for ANYTHING! *hugs*  Gave my PowerPoint presentation today. I was extremely nervous, and I guess it showed. Kinda sucks when people are rude enough to start laughing and make fun of you... a little thing called class would tell you that openly cracking up is not very nice, and can hurt someone's feelings... yeah.  "Errrybody in the club gettin' tipsy!"
