What does she want from me?  2. stupid lecturer giving me 52% for my learning diary (We are supposed to write about what we learnt, how we learnt, what we didn’t learn, why etc. I wrote that I didn’t feel I learnt very much this module, that it was badly organised, and the content was pretty poor. Basically the lecturer obviously took this rather personally and gave me a crap mark for NO reason)  3. Got speeding ticket (there is this stretch that I drive EVERY day and it is 30mph, then 40mph, then 30mph and one day I obviously forgot which was which and did 40 in the 30 bit. Now I have £60 fine and 3 points on my license. And the majority of the time I do 30 and am being overtaken by everyone!)  Think Mel’s idea is good – and I will try and think of a positive thing for each of the bad things – not necessarily trying to think of the same thing but in a positive light, but another positive thing to counteract the negative.  Good things: 1.Helped flatmate and friend with their presentation on Fairtrade and it went well.  2. I emailed Rachel and said that we were getting nowhere and that we needed to forget, forgive and move on.  Even though I had told her all the way through, I repeated that I liked her, cared about her and wanted to be her friend.  She has just replied and although was really defensive initially, then got what I was saying and said ok. So hey we might be moving again.  Feels like a train that has been stuck in a tunnel for 3 weeks.  And hopefully we come out the other end of the tunnel, and although the scenery won’t be the same as it was before, maybe we can still keep moving forwards.  I also phoned her during the MJ gig (see next point) and just let her listen to one of the songs which had the words ‘I love you, I hope you realise that’.  Hope it helped.  3. Went to see Martyn Joseph tonight at St Martins in the Bullring (Ok Jules if you are reading this - stop being sick, he’s not like he was in your day!)  He is the amazingly cool guy who places guitar and sings.  He is a Christian and lots of songs are subtly about God and stuff, but they are mostly about real issues, real struggles, real life.  About things like the war in Iraq, the redundant miners in Wales, the plight of the landless in Brazil, about what God is really about.  They aren’t life is all wonderful and perfect, but life is sometimes crap, but we can make it, we can do it.  He sang this excellent song about waiting for Sunday.  How screwed up the world is, had terrible everything is, how we are on Friday still, but Sunday will come – he will keep his promises.   And his latest album is called ‘Whoever it was who brought me here will have to take me home’ and it’s a wonderful song – the words just spoke volumes to me, especially: “….I’m trying to work out what it is I should be, A dented saint searching for some sanctuary, I’m remembering grace, And things I hold dear, And whoever it was that brought me here will have to take me home.”   I sat in the church listening to this and just crying out to God.    Anyway, so although its been a bit crap, am feeling quite positive. I CAN do this. I’m going to have rubbish days, but it is worth it right? There WILL come a time when its not this hard right?  I think the thing is that I expected things to be better now, not to struggle at all, to be 100%, to be able to cope with anything and everything that life throws at me. But I don’t thing I am, I can. But that’s ok too I think.  Another of Martyn’s songs is about this guy who was on this expedition up some mountain – think it was Everest. Anyway he goes into a coma halfway down and his team have to leave him, because the chances are that he will die anyway. So they go, but he wakes up and realises that if he has any chance of living he will have to get up and walk down the mountain.  And this song was inspired by this, and how sometimes in life we need to get a different perspective on something, try and see something in a different way, in order to move forwards, to make it. We have to just lift up our heads and go for it. And the words are amazing so I’ll put them all here (sorry):  Looks like I’m ready Though its crazy I know There’s not a star in the stormy sky To guide me home And all this heavy baggage That brought me to this place Has left me high and stranded, staring at this face   I’m gonna walk down the mountain With my head in the sky I’m gonna walk down the mountain If I stay here I will die   Through static on the radio I try to talk where I can see But a gentle wisdom to survive It don’t always set you free   I’m gonna walk……    Goodnight all. Sweet dreams.
