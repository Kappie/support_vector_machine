       
      Well, my big six day weekend has turned in exactly zero productivity.  I let it get away from me big time.  I guess I kept thinking I had all this time, so I kept putting everything off, when I really didn't have that much time at all.  And then - it was all gone.  So today's the last day, and I'm scrambling to get stuff done again.  The good news is I only have class tomorrow, and then I get four more days.  One of those will be filled with reviewing for the MPRE, but other than that, I should feel the crunch, and get some stuff done.  And perhaps even have a little relaxation time...
