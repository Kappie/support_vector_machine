I was hostessing at Shoney's (btw hostessing is sooo much more fun than salad bar...on Saturday, I was on at least cloud seven and a half), and I seated two French people who requested the non-smoking section.  Thank goodness Dominique taught me to count to five in French: un, deux, trois, quatre, cinc (I'm sure those are misspelled).  I also know monsieur, madmoiselle, madame, merci, au revoir, parlez vous Francais, and, of course, a certain phrase courtesy of Ms Christina that I'll never use (listen to Lady Marmalade).  I tend to take a milder version of Miss Pross's attitude to the French (read A Tale of Two Cities) - French people aren't very nice.  The French people I sat were kindly, and I love Mrs. Jordan (Keyette sponsor), but in general my experiences with them aren't very good.  Here's my French quotes:       "This from the country whose greatest cultural contribution is a horny skunk?" -Darrell Hammond, Best of Christopher Walken, SNL       "Victory?  We're FRENCH!  We don't even have a word for it!" -Homer Simpson, from the parody of Joan of Arc, The Simpsons  Know what else cramps my style?  Pricks.  It seems that as soon as one person stops being one, another one shows up.  Every single year since middle school, there's been one worse than the next.  In sixth grade, there was Ryan, seventh and eighth Chewy (do NOT believe the stories about Spanish II), ninth Hunter (I suppose she's a bitch, not a prick), and tenth Alex (bio - worst class ever, even when the subject got occasionally interesting).  I suppose he stopped being one this year, maybe around winter break.  Actually, he's been really nice lately.  Anyway, back to this new character.  He works with me, and thinks he's better than me.  America, if there's one thing that will make me instantly dislike you, it's ARROGANCE.  I hate that!  Unless you have a redeeming characteristic to balance the conceit, I WILL instantly dislike you.  Come to think of it, just about everyone I've ever disliked I've disliked because of pride (or supercilliousness, if you're Shaheen).  Ryan, Chewy, ESPECIALLY Alex...of course there's others, but those are the major ones.   Enough ranting and raving about arrogance and French people.  We had our yearbook distribution day, in which I screamed my bloody head off telling people "J, K and L HERE" and other stuff that I'd rather not have shouted.  I wish I could have gotten more people to sign my yearbook though (by the time Mr Young finally let us go, almost everyone was gone...I just went to the newsroom and had another go with the front page...actually, there wasn't much to do besides changing everything from March to June, and aligning everything at the bottom, which was no easy feat).  There's always tomorrow. We went birthday shopping today, and I found THE most adorable hair things.  There's this 50s inspired black and white hair band (for the guys, that wide thing that is just a tiny bit further back from the place where the hairline meets the forehead); this fluffy clip-on pink flower that would be great with a side ponytail, a coral shirt and a denim skirt; and this hairband with two chiffon scarves attached that looks just like those retro girls that wave the scarves to start the races on roads with names like "Thunder Road" (straight from Grease). Wow, I am waaay too excited over some hair accessories.  For the price though ($3 each, about $13 total), it's difficult to beat.  I've been shopping THREE times for my birthday, and with the exception of a cute pink top, I can't find any shirts I like, and I need at least three.  I definitely want to try that layered tanks thing, which looks so damn cool on that Gap commercial (told you I'm a sucker for advertising).   Well I'm all written out for the day (plus, other than more tales of work, which you're probably sick of, and how I scrambled all day to finish Boswell's paper, and how people don't really like the yearbook this year, especially the people section, I really don't have much else to say).  I'm also tired, because I slept between 40 minutes and two hours, which just makes you more tired.  One more random quote courtesy of Brittany E.'s profile: "Should I smile cuz you're my friend or cry cuz thats all we'll ever be?"  Later.
