I have to babysit again on Friday same hours.  Then tomorrow after babysitting I have to go out with my aunt to buy supplies for a scrapbook I don't even want to do anymore, nor do I really have the time to do... even though I just sit around anyway.  That won't exactly be the case if I get a job though.  Softball will be starting soon.  I might as well just drop out... I already paid for it though.  At least I'm getting money for umpiring.  Training starts on Tuesday, it had better be worth my time.  God I'm really bored.  Scott's not talking... no one else worth talking to is online.  I guess I'll go read.
