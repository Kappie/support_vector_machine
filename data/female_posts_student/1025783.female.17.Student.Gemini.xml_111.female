Cora was the same. Her small body was fragile, especially for a girl of 10, but when I looked closely I could see the old woman inside, gasping for breath and hunching over so many burdens and so many memories. Cora and I lived in such a different time then now. Our time was 100 years ago, 1850 back in Wyoming out on Poppa's farm. It had been a happy time, an era of wealth, prosperity and a myriad of friends and family. Cora and I were but young children, mere babes as I see it now. 10 and 12, Cora and I respectively had helped Poppa on the farm, doing chores, cooking and greeting the unending river of friends stopping by in rushes of hugs, warmth and fresh bread.  I still recall those days with a satirical laugh.  Such naivity and freshness we had exuded, Cora and I often lament, such easy prey we were.            I remember the day he came. "Tall man!" Cora had whispered in a awed, hushed voice and she darted into the barn. I was gathering Chicka's eggs and sat down on a bench and wiped my brow with a dirty hankerchief as I had seen Poppa done a thousand times before. "What's this about?" I asked solemnly. Cora had a way of creating myths and fabrications, and thus I was not alarmed. Her dark brown eyes opened wide and she tried to measure this man's length with her pale, slender arms. "Bigger than the horses!" She crowed, brown eyes dancing and sparkling. She danced around and twirled her arms, sending tumbles of dark black hair tumbling out of her bonnet. "Coraline Maria Solden!" I admonished loudly, standing up and knocking over my basket of eggs. I yelped as they tumbled out, rolling over the hay and across the dirt. Cora laughed and we both plopped down on the ground to start retrieving them. I crawled around on all fours and was just about to scoop up the last little white treasure when it was picked up for me. I remember his hands being the first thing I saw, and already I knew something was wrong. Long, pale, sharp fingers. Fingers the color of milk, unlike the tanned, calloused fingers I was used to seeing around the farm. They transformed into long arms, covered with a stiff black suit. So long, so lean and so wrong for our sunny, informal home. I rose slowly, letting my eyes soak in the abberation. "Here son, you dropped this," The voice was stiff, as though mechanic and not oiled properly. I took the egg from the outstretched fingers, careful not to touch them for fear of catching the length disease this man obviously had. I looked up and gazed at his face. Pale as his hands, if not paler. Wavy black hair, black as Cora's tied into a neat ponytail at the nape of his neck. Pale lips, thin and parted slightly to reveal two perfectly lined points of white soldiers ready to fight. A thin, slanted noise pointing down sharply, black eyes, blacker than coals or midnight. He rose to at least 6 feet 6 inches, from his black boots to his coarse, brown felt hat, maybe more, for as a child I was inept at measuring distances with my eyes. I muttered a weak thank you and fell back in line with Cora, who looked just as forlorn as I. My father stepped out from behind the man, wringing his hat and refusing to look either of us in the eye. "Kids," He said in a fallaciously cheery voice, "This is my....friend Lukander Voss" Poppa tried to meet my eyes but couldn't. "He's going to be...staying with us for a while- he has business in town." Cora and I exchanged furtive glances. Business in our town of 5,000 consisted of a new plow or buying live stock- neither of which Mr. Voss seemed familar with. Mr. Voss coughed uncomfortably and shifted his feet. His boots scraped on the dusty barn floor, sending up a cloud of dust. "Well, I'm very happy to be staying with you!" His voice was loud, and out of place. I looked over to see Cora wince slightly, my reaction as well. As he and Poppa stepped out into the sunlight, Cora and I sat down heavily, leaning against Chicka's pen walls. She led out a whoosh of air and I merely nodded. As we look back on these times of trivial youth, we become furious with our past selves for not beingmore aware of the ominous feelings we were both having.
