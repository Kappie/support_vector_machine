I think that's going to be for the best. Maybe we were just holding on to something that wasn't really there to begin with just so we could have someone. I do know that I really do love him with all my heart but I am just not sure if we were meant to be together. So anyway I am doing pretty well considering. Actually I have had two very good nights last night and tonight. What is so funny I watched the movie Bad Santa both nights. Go Figure!!! Anyway I have had a little too much wine to drink tonight so I think I will go to bed. I promise when I am not so tipsy I will get you more up to date on the situation at hand.
