DVD all the way! 2)  Best Literary/Movie Villan:   Hmmm... the only villan that ever really freaked me out was Ursula from the Little Mermaid movie.  :-) 3)  Meat: rare or well-done?   In betweeny  ; ) 4)  To be fair-- Boxers or briefs?   I prefer a boxer guy... tighty whities have GOT to go... 5)  Beer or Liquor/Wine?   Beer or liquor...? I'm not big on wine at this point in my life.  I'm more for mixed drinks... but sometimes I enjoy a beer... 6)  Coke or Mountain Dew?   Diet Dr. Pepper 7)  Carpet or Hardwood Floors   We have laminate wood floors in the dining/living room... and I wish we had it throughout the house... 8)  American cars or foreign?   I currently own an American car, but foreign cars are pretty good, too... specifically foreign cars from Germany. 9)  Coffee: Caffeinated or Decaf?   CAFFEINATED!  What's the point, otherwise? 10)  Thought-Provoking Question of the Week: Computers: Do they make life better or worse? Why?  I can't imagine life without computers in it. They benefit more than take away from our way of life. Think about all the knowledge that is shared and distributed now. Sure there are negatives about technology, but in this case, I think benefits definitely out-weigh the negatives.  Plus, think of where computer technology is headed...
