Definitely not a strategy I would take. THis article is claiming that Victoria will be staying at a seperate place to all the other partners of England footballers. Now if the rumours are true and she is already excluded from much of the activities that these partners do together I would have thought staying with them would have been a better idea. Not my call I guess, but still this girl needs to stop giving tabloids ammunition against her. If she doesn't want to be portrayed as a spolit pop star then perhaps she needs to be seen in environments with normal people.
