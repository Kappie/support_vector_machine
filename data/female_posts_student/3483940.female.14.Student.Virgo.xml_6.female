Hah... FUCK, FUCK, FUCK. so stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. i dont care anymore. nope i dont care. Its always about "Her". Always...  I know this person is far from perfect. most people are. i just need to get this out. I dont want to like him, not at all. But i do. Im sick of thinking one thing, when its totally about something else. Im sick of this place. I NEED TO BE HAPPY. so much shit. just stacking its self into messy rows.   You think that you are happy. But are you really? Because if you are happy, is there something that you know will not make you happy? or are you usually happy for like 5 minutes, then it all changes? Or when everything seems to be going right, but something has to come in ruin it all? So many odd little things can do that. I think im going crazy. meh.    For one to understand where i am comming from or to understand me, i think they had to of expierinced similar things. Not many people have. so if you havent. i dont care. i wouldnt care otherwise.   A year ago I wouldnt have felt this way. I had myself figured out. Thought i knew everything. I told myself i wouldn't be someone that i am today. Its funny how things work out. Im in a state of figuring out if im good or not. Because im not sure how I am right now... Its an odd feeling. Like am i happy, or mad. I want to feel relaxed... like i have nothing to worry about. I fear i will never feel that way. But i am learning how to live like that... How to take control and fix things.   I just feel like crawling into my bed and going to sleep. Hey anyone who reads this, leave a comment. i want to know how many people acutally read this shit that i write and what they think about it. i dont care how many people read it though. numbers are not important. Just would like to to know.   Hannah
