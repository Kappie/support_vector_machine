This should be real interesting. I made it simple and I somehow shall walk the path that I’ve chosen. Basically my big issues right now is to save up as much as possible. The more, the better. I’ll become a work alcoholic. I’ll party every now and then. I’ll not only ignore buddies phone calls but I will not put myself in the center of attention anymore. I’m just going to vanish into my own little world. It’s called Sakdary’s La La Land.   I want to own a house before Alyssia starts school or before I turn 27. Not too much time is left for me. I must do what I have to rite? A three bedroom house, two story high, yard and car garage sounds perfect. I’ll be transfer to Sacramento within a few years and that’s my destination. I’m also sick and tired of the bay area. Better education is offered for Alyssia. That’s all I have in mind as of rite now.    Oh the other hand Harvey bull shit about making his short cut side money and mainly talks about his dream car. The new Navigator w/24’s, drop, fully loaded, 6 screens, etc. All there is with Harvey is fast cars, girls’ girls’ girls, and a big fat house with an extremely big fat car garage. Talks about his job, everyone is going to get laid off pretty soon. Oh did I mention that he build satellite for Space Loral System company? Anyways that company is going down. He’ll probably get laid off at the end of August. That poor boy.    Dinner with Harvey isn’t as charming as having dinner with Vu. Harvey complains like a girl. The place isn’t his kina place. The food wasn’t delicious. People there drinks vine and he had cock tails. But to me it’s the opposite. I didn’t want to say anything to over react because it was his birthday. I got him a bottle of cologne. After dinner we called it a night.
