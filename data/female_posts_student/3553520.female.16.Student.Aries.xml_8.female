I feel like a failure. I'm running into the wall once again.  I see the signs. I see the lights, but I never see the wall.  Three more days, and then I'm free.  I'll never have to go back there again.  Three more days and my life is over.  Because I dont know where I'm going after this.  Sure, I know whats planned. But thats never the problem.  Its what I dont plan for. Its what I dont see coming.  That I run into again and again.  "Hello, wall. Its nice to see you again."  Except I never see him. I just run blindly until I can feel his abrasive touch once again.  Story of my life.  Story of my death.  Whats coming next? Life, [version 1.6].
