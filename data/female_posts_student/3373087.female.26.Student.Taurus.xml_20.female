What kind of soil does my heart contain?   1)  Trampled ground : Hardened by the sin of bitterness and unforgiveness; unable to accept a message from God. 2)  Shallow soil : Accept God's word in my mind, but the truth will not penetrate my heart to make a difference in my actions. 3)  Thorny soil : Distracted by the cares of the world; the pursuit of earthly pleasures prevents God's Word from taking hold and producing rightnessness. 4)  Good soil : Receives the word from God, aplies it, and brings forth fruit in due time.  I think I most identify with the shallow soil.  I often listen well to the messages, take notes, agree with the pastor, and then go home unchanged.  I need to meditate on God's word so that it penetrates not only my mind, but in my heart.  I need to have more than just an intellectual assent regarding the truth in God's word.   How do I cultivate good soil in my heart?  I need to repent of bitterness, anger, cynicism, and unforgiveness in my heart.  These things make my heart hard.  Even if I hear God's word day after day, it will not change me.  I'm so tired of being all talk and no action.  How long will it take for me to act upon my convictions? I finally want God's word to penetrate my heart so that I will live a changed life.  I see the potential of living a changed life, now that I'm back in His word and spending time with Him daily.    It's true that the condition of my heart will change daily, depending on how I cultivate it.  I need to guard my heart against complacency and thinking that I'm more than I am. Romans 12:3--"Do not think of yourselves more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you."  I need to be mindful of DAILY cultivating a heart that will absorb God's word and allow it to change my life.  Once again, I need to repent and daily give myself over to God.  Most of all, I need to ASK God to forgive me.    "The Word of God is sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12)  God's word is this powerful, but it fails to change me because of the hardness of my heart (from lack of repentance), not because of its impotency.    Lord, thank you for Your Word.  It has the power to change me, if only my heart were fertile soil.  You gave me the Bible so I can learn about who you are and what pleases you.  It teaches me how to worship and to discern right from wrong.  It tells me about who You are, how much you love us, and what a low tolerance you have for idolatry and willful disobedience.  It also tells me about how I am and how often I do what I do not want to do because my flesh is weak (Romans 7:15) It teaches and disciplines me, it gives me comfort and encouragement.  It is full of stories of faulty people like Abraham and Moses as a testimony that You can use anyone for Your kingdom.  It gives me hope that you can use even me.    Please forgive me for not taking your Word seriously.  I want Your truth to penetrate my heart so that I can live for you, not for myself.  I want to be changed by Your word.  Help me to diligently read the Bible and daily prepare my heart to put your commands into action.  Amen.    **Prayer Requests**  1) Jamie: Broke up with Alvin last weekend and is struggling with understanding what happened.  Pray that she would cry out to God during this time, because He is the only one who will be completely faithful to her and will fulfill all her needs. 2) Brandon: Pray that the fire that was rekindled at church camp will not be quenched now that he is back in Boston.  Pray for a hunger for God's Word that will result in diligence in his quiet time.  My hope is that he will spend time with God not out of a sense of duty or obligation, but out of a genuine desire to know his Savior.  I pray that God would give us certainty (in His time) about the future of our relationship. 3) Brian Lee: A return to his first love and escape from New York.  He needs someone in his life that will lead in back to God and remind him of the God he knew in his youth. 4) Sue: Relief from TMJ pain.  She needs a nightguard SOON.   Lord, will you make a way so that her insurance will cover the costs completely?  You are able.   5) Mary: Reconciliation with her mom regarding the conflict they had yesterday.  I know that Mary feels very frustrated with her parents and feels like they are very critical of her.  Pray that she would be able to enroll in that required course next term.  If that is not the Lord's will, then I pray for patience regarding the timing of her marriage to Kevin. 6) Priscilla: Wedding in two weeks! Pray for peace in her heart regarding Enoch's parents. Pray that preparations will go smoothly and stress-free. 7) Driving to SF tonight to pick up Meem.  Pray for safety and patience with and LOVE for M  D and Meem.
