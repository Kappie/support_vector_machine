But anyway, school starts in 3 days and I'm not ok with it. I hate school. Walking into that buliding makes my stomach all queasy and I get migranes. I think I should be allowed to hibernate through the supposed "best days of my life". Oh well, at least Messy will be there to help pull me through.      I've been thinking a lot about faith and God lately. I mean I'm a Christian I was saved in December, but this whole faith thing is really really difficult. I'm doing this devotion thing called the seven checkpoints, and I've never had to think so hard in my life. It's really pointing out how weak my faith is, and how little I trust God to actually do what he says. It's kind of strange. I hate having to get all in depth and stuff with people. I'm pretty sure that's why I struggle in my relationship with God a lot. Trusting God and all that sounds so easy, but actually applying it to my life and living it out is a whole other story.       I went to the fair today and worked at the booth that IBSA set up. They were giving away "good news" bracelets. You know the kind with the green bead for creation, black for sin, red for Jesus's blood, white for salvation, blue for baptisim, and gold for heaven. So I got to help some kids make some and explain it to them and it was pretty awesome. There was an adult lady there that was kind of bitter, and said she absolutely didn't want one, but then I went through it with a little boy and she watched me and come over and asked for a bracelet and brochure. I thought that was kinda cool. Especially since when people get all hard hearted like that it makes me really upset.       Oh yeah! Today I painted my room lime green! The color is tight, but the first coat is beyond frightening looking. My mom keeps telling me the second coat will look better, and since I didn't believe her she got my dad trying to convince me so let's just say I hope they're both right. Second coat goes on tomorrow so I'm way excited to see what it will look like done.       That's it for now!      Jesus loves you!
