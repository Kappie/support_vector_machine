I went mini-golfing with friends and actually won with a 53....oh yeah. That's right baby. However, I did only win by two strokes. Then, we went to Noodles to have some...noodles, as Mary Clare put it so elequently. I made sure to call Peter and wish him a happy birthday and then, I went out with Bryan. Very fun times. We went to Cookie Dough Creations and walked around a bit and...just a good fun time. We definitely had some interesting conversations. :)   And now...I have to get going.. People to do, things to see. Wait, reverse that.   Lots of love.
