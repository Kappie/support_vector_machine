Ideally I'd like this to be a place where I can process my thoughts about my relationship with the LORD, and whoever chooses to read it can comment on it - or argue with me, or agree heartily.  Whatever your little heart desires.  I find that I don't have the time to have the kinds of discussions that I'd like to about the Word, prophecy, prayer, etc. and I'm not currently in a Bible study, so perhaps this can be a place of spiritual stimulation and growth.  Who knows?  I've also found in the last few days that some of my dearest friends are frustrated with me because I haven't shared with them (for lack of time, mostly) the things I saw, heard, and learned from God in Russia/Siberia.  Well, hopefully this will be a forum for me to share some of those things, and to get some feedback.    So today I've been thinking about what God smells like.  Wondering, I suppose, would be a more appropriate word.  Does He smell like the outside world, since He is the Creator God, the uncreated One?  Does He smell like a campfire, since He is a Consuming Fire?  Does He smell like freshly baked bread, since He is the Bread of Life?  I started thinking, "Well, that's a dumb question, He's spiritual, so He probably doesn't have a physical smell."  But then I thought, "Jesus is both God and Man, and He has a body, so He has to have some kind of smell."  Not that this has any incredible spiritual bearing on my theology or anything, but I know that the Holy Spirit often uses my imagination to exhort me to think about Him in new ways, outside the box of my legalistic religiosity.  Also today God's been speaking to me (I love that He still talks to me on Sundays, even when I'm a pagan and have to go to work instead of church) about being a prophetic voice.  Not just the spooky-ooky "I have a specific word of the LORD for you" (although I do believe that's possible - I've been on the giving and receiving end of that before), but just the speaking forth of truth and life and light.  Words are so powerful, and even one word or a small phrase can be incredibly powerful.  In Mark 4:39 Jesus merely says "Peace.  Be still!" and the storm immediately subsides.  He had power, not just because He was and is God, but because He had the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the approval of His Father.  Which believers have access to!  There is a passage in Ezekiel 37 (the valley of dry bones) that has always intrigued me, and the Holy Spirit is beginning to give me insight to it, as I continue to listen to Him breathe through the pages.  It says...  1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?"  I said, "O Sovereign LORD , you alone know."  4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD ! 5 This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath [1] enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD .' "  7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.  9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.' " 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet-a vast army.  11 Then he said to me: "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.' 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O my people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the LORD , when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD .' "    There is so much here that I could talk about, but the clearest whisper I've heard from the LORD today is about the complaint from the dry bones in verse 11.  They say that they are dried up and their hope is gone.  They are cut off.  The LORD gave Ezekiel the power and the passion to prophesy to the dry bones and to give them life and hope.  There are so many people in my life right now who are dry, who are without hope, without a future.  It's because they are cut off from the LORD.  They are without the Source of Life.  I think especially of the teenagers I've just recently started to work with at my new job.  (I'm a technician/counselor assistant at a residential rehab center for teens with drug abuse and mental health issues.)  They are so hopeless, so lifeless.  And there are certain rules and regulations that prevent me from speaking openly about my faith - but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to pray like crazy for these kids and speak life and truth to them at every God-given opportunity.  My prayer for myself today, and for whoever is reading this, is that I (and you!) would be sensitive to the Holy Spirit, so that when He chooses to use me (and you!) as a mouthpiece, I (you!) can be a voice crying in the wilderness, a voice prophesying, "LIVE! LIVE!"  I also pray for a life of worshipful obedience.  One of the things the LORD spoke to me the most clearly in my recent trip to Siberia was "just obey me, girl."  Yes, there is grace.  Yes, there is mercy.  But as we are increasingly obedient to the LORD and His covenant with us, there is increasing intimacy, and increasing power.  With obedience comes purity, and a renewed sensitivity to the leading of the Holy Spirit.  There is a phrase from a song written by Jason Upton that says "there's a power in purity that breaks principalities, that brings the authorities down to their knees."  I'm not content with half-hearted obedience.  I'm not content with a lukewarm walk.  I want to KNOW the God who formed me in my mother's womb, the way that He knows me.  I want to hear His voice.  I want to see His face.  I want to know what He smells like!  ;o)  I want Him to use me to prophesy truth to the harassed and the helpless.  I want Him to use me to set the captives free.  I want Him to use me to break down the principalities of the prince of the air.  I want Him to use me to bring Him glory.  "I am my Beloved's, and His desire is for me."  I love this verse from Song of Songs, but I also want to reciprocate that desire.  I want my desire to be for the LORD, not for the things of this world, which are dust.  I am HUNGRY for the things of God.  I won't be satisfied anymore with money and perceived security and cheesy, false Hollywood concepts of romance.  Having a million dollars or a huge house or a husband is not what will give me life, or make me happy, or satisfy the deepest longings of my soul.  MY GOD SHALL SUPPLY ALL MY NEEDS, ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY.  HE WILL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE OVER ME, JEHOVAH JIREH CARES FOR ME.
