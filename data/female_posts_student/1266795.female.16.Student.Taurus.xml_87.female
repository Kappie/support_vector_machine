For the last one it was For those in misery perhaps better things will follow. And, as Alison said, it was Virgil. The one before that, was Don't judge higher than the sandles. And her is teh story, in slightly more detail... Apelles, Greek painter, would put his pictures where the public could see them and then stand out of sight so he could listen to their comments. A shoemaker once faulted the painter for a sandal with one loop too few, which Apelles corrected. The shoemaker, emboldened by this acceptance of his views, then criticised the subject's leg. According to Pliny Apelles replied to this that the shoemaker should not judge beyond his sandals. (One should judge only matters that one knows something about.) Ah. The lessons learned from Greek painters are many...or maybe not so many. Whatever.  Yeah, so Strawberry festival today. Well, we ran low on time, so we cut I bought me a Cat, which I was EXTREMELY HAPPY about. Otherwise, I missed some rhythms and notes, but nothing too noticable. Tomorrow we play in the spring concert at Faith at 7:00. I hope people show up! (Other than the performers) I'll be a lot happier, when I can pay more attention to the music. I want to hear some of the other groups, like the Brass and the Bells. I've never heard them before really. (Meaning, I've heard the Brass practice from down the hall, but that's all.) So yeah. My day revolved around practicing and getting ready. And then practicing some more with the group! That was my day, how was everyone elses? SCORES: (in descending order) Alison: 740 Michael: 520 Olivia: 460 Nathan: 350 Evan: 160 Jonah: 160 Sarah: 160  "I never tire of being useful."
