I can feel my eyelids slowly closing in the middle of class! Yuck- I hate hearing the idea of having a class during summer! Its only 3 hours but still....  yesterday i went shopping and got the cutest pair of  urlLink bright green cropped pants  and a blue halter from Gap. I just love that store sometimes!   listening to- "a favor house atlantic" by Coheed and Cambria
