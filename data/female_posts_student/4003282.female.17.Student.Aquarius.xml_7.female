I sat there and did  money . Then a lil while after everything was almost  done . I talked with John and me, Molly and Savanna are going to help  paint  the coolers. They look so  ragged . OH! I got the  coolest  idea for band next  year . Well ok. Thanks to     Brandon  ! I thought we could do a  40's ,  50's  theme. Kinda like a  swing  band sorta thing. And have  Mr. LaRoque  and  Mr. Cornish  do little   jazzy   solo's. Then the  flags  were like black  souts.  With  white  ties and hats that kinda go over their  left  eye. OH! Wouldn't that be the  coolest ! I mean do you know how many kids would  join  band if we did something like that. I think  alot  would. Just cause it's something  different  and  neat.  Ya know? I'm sucha band   nerd  !I'm just getting so    involved.       I'm running for   Jounior   V.P. Oh yeah, The only person that could  beat  me is Rachel.      I decided when I have a   baby  . That her or his rooms gonna be done in  duckies !! YAY! Just cause today me and mommy went  shopping  for Danielle's stuff for her and her baby. And I saw so much  duckies  stuff it was crazy.  I love  Duckies . I'm gonna name my girl   K e b  r  a   B  e  l  l  . I   think that's  pretty . And her rooms gonna be in  duckies !      I can't wait for  Nicole  to have her baby. She finds out   September 8th   what she's having. I want a  girl  just cause I don't know how to take care of  boys . But a boy would be totally  fine .       Brandon   ditched   me today to go to some  competetion  thingy. I don't know  what  it was. But next weekend we are going  shopping . He's gonna be like my   gay   guy friend that tells me if I should get those  jeans  or not. Haha but Brandon's  not  gay. Totally   stright  . Remember I  dated  this boy.      My  Paw paw's  friend died today. He feel's  bad  cause he used to  work  for the railraod and they have  reunions . Well he didn't go to the  last  one and he would have saw  Bell  there. So he feels really bad. Aww. My poor paw paw.       OH! I talked to  Josh  today! Aww. I  missed  him s0o0o much. I think he called my  cell  phone cause I don't reconize the number. I  love  him. I just wished he would get  on .
