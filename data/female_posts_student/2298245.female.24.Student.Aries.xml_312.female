It's a satire of all those political quizzes you see out there that are supposed to tell your affiliation should be.  This one turns it all on its head.  Probably most fun for those who already have a sense of their own orientation and want to have a good laugh at their own expense.  So if you have trouble laughing at yourself, then proceed with caution to the  urlLink Satirical Political Beliefs Assessment Test .  There are four categories of response to each question:  CONS (Archconservative); LIBL (Leftwing Wacko); LBRT (Antigovernment Libertine); COMM (Commie Sympathizer).  Here's a sample of what you will find:   Robin Hood's practice of stealing from the rich to give to the poor was...  CONS: a crime. LIBL: a brave, generous and heroic deed. LBRT: a foolish, misguided attempt at social engineering.  COMM: an inspiration to us all.    And then:   How do you feel about nude sunbathing?   CONS: Never tried it.  Never will. LIBL: Did it a lot in my college days. LBRT: Do it so often, I no longer need sunscreen. COMM: It repulses me.  You see, for some mysterious reason, God made naked communists rather unsightly.   Check out the whole thing.  There are lots of questions for lots of laughs.
