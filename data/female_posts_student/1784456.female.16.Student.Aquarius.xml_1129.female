Either way, she'll probably start groaning about it later so run away while you can! ;) Sorry, had a hard day. (Like that gives you an excuse to be mean to people) Oh ho. Mmm... about taking over the world... MUHAHA! Never mind. I'm not so bored nowerdays! I go on Star Wars Chess (yes, groan) and whip the Dark Side's ass! Yeaah! (Is that good?) Err... yes.... Well now I can beat people at chess... yeay. Like any one's ever gonna want to play it. Oh well. Guess I could beat Jon because he's a sexist pig, infact I think that I might! Yeah! Mmm I am weird. Bored though, sooo bored. I really need to do some thing! Oh yeah, I'm going to piano and then walking home so block me out tomorrow because the world will be painted black and every one will be evil. YEAY!
