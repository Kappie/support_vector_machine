I finally discovered what I want.   and i want so much.  but today, i don't want you.    I love this feeling.  The one that comes when your heart is empty.  There's no tingling, no aching, no  anything.     Right now there's just a calm and peaceful sort of nothing that's settling around me like dust and cobwebs.    It's good to be me again.   (me, and not you.)   I don't know why I felt the need to lie.  To myself, to my friends.  I guess it just seemed the best way to hide.  It always does...  But I don't have to hide anymore; the monster's out of the closet.  And he's not as scary as I imagined.    Everything is lighter.  This is a good place to be.  Here and now...  Here's hoping I never leave.      "I wanted you to know, I love the way you laugh."   [thisistheend.]
