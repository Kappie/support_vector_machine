But I think I know who reads this now, and I know I won't offend anyone, hopefully. I'll send you an email later though Sabrina, I've been meaning to catch up with you. And with about 50 other people. It gets hard.  Well, I succeeded in pissing off Nick today, I think. Although, I've been off-and-on mad at him for a few days. I haven't seen him in a while, and I'd like to, and each time I try, I dunno..The responce is less than enthusiastic. When I call him, he's all surprised, and then unresponsive. Which reaaaaaaaaaally bugs me. And then I try and make plans with him, to have him come see me, and stuff, and he never does...He'll be "Oh I'll get up early and do this and this!" and then calls me mid-morning and says he hasn't done anything, and prolly won't be able to do anything. GRAH!. Then we'll talk about stuff that's been planned and junk already, like his dad's birthday party, and going up to qualicum, and he makes it sound that he doesn't really want me to come. And it really ticks me off...I mean, I went out and got something decent to wear to his dad's thing tomorw, and then Nick thought I wasn't gonig to go just cause I was going out and staying up all night. Like, come on. I didn't say that, I said I might be a little dead, or VERY overtired and hyper, but I still wanted to go! Sometimes,.... I just get so mad at him sometimes, that I just want to end it, right there. And then I do it all in my head, yell and scream at him, and then I feel better, and everything's back to normal. But sometimes....I dunno. I just dunno.   If you read this Nicky, disregard it. I'm going to call you before I leave, or tonight when I can get away and do some work (cause I still have oodles of planning for Camp Pringle to do). Alright?I still love you, don't worry. I'll talk to you later.  And for the rest of you.....I dunno. Hi :). Sabrina I added you to the pagey thing. I feel talented now :D Enjoy the heat wave..I wish I was going swimmnig today..*whimper*
