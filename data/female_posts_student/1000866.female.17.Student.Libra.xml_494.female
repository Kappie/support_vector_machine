Sometimes, when you know the right thing in your heart...you just have to go with it. It's kind of interesting how I was forced to learn this one, not because of me, but because of someone else. I know this will be useful at sometime, and of course, knowing me, I wont see it then but I'm hoping that maybe some minute part of my brain will hold this in...
