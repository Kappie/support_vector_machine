The whole class was so obviously bored, and practically no one was paying attention to the tutor.   Before BCS, at APEL, we had to do a personality survey test. We tabulated the results and plotted it against a graph to see which "fish" we belong too. Yes,   fish  . There are four fishes - Colourful Guppy, Peaceful Angelfish, Powerful Swordtail and Careful Goldfish. You can roughly guess which personality each type represent. So I did the test and guess what, I'm not under any category! The plotted point on the graph was in the middle of nowhere, at the cross section of all the four categories. It's is like saying: Sorry, but you have a personality disorder!    This is so similar to when in sec4, we had to take a career survey test to see what job fits us. And mine said something like "Sorry, there are   no   jobs suitable for you. But dont worry, there are other opportunities." while everyone else had jobs which suited them!  Damn, I'm always the   odd   one out.
