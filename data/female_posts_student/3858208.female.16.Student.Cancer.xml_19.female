[As I currently have nothing of importance to blog about, I've decided to take an idea from  urlLink blogideas.com .]    1 :: Body Art. Here's something I bet you didn't know: crayons actually  do  work on skin. For best results, use dark colors on pale skin. To achieve the best effect, press crayon hard into skin.  2 ::Candles. Just melt a bunch of crayons together, pour the hot wax into a mold with a wick, let cool/hardenand voila! Instant candle.  3:: Put them in the gas tank of your worst enemy. Self-explanatory, me thinks.  4::Draw a muralin a bathroom stall. You'restill using them to draw with, but you're drawing someplacecompletely out of the ordinary.    This is harder than it sounds...does anyone have anyto add?    Chelsea's mad at me right now because she wants to go online and I won't let her. Too bad - she should've gotten her work done earlier so that she could get on before I did. Ha! She made a 'slideshow' of the stuff I didn't clean in the kitchen, which is bullshit because I did clean, and I cleaned well. I honestly think she put all her 'evidence' there herself. But you know what? Whatever.  I  know that I did my work and that she's a lying *****, and that's good enough for me.    Quick note: I just took a  urlLink What Color Moon Dragon are You?  quiz, and here's what I got:  "You are  Silver.  You're a mysterious person. You don't let people get too close to you because you're afraid of getting hurt."  Coincidence? I think not!      RIGHT NOW     mood ::  pissed but trying to calm down   listening to/watching ::  chels watching TV in the living room   eating/drinking ::  nothing   craving ::  love...   talking to ::  nobody...   thinking about ::  *him*   wishing ::  that Chels would stop trying to blackmail me or w/e the fukk she's trying to do   wearing ::  jeans and a t-shirt   random ::  Yesterday at dinner my aunt said that "she never thought her neice would be punk," refering of course to me.
