I got a call not more than 5 minutes after I got to my supervisors desk, requesting that I come down to the 1st floor and pick up a package, mind you all that I am on the 25th floor of the building I work in. When I got to the 1st floor, I walked to security desk and My friend John was working there today (security for our building) He said that these, pointing to a cart with a beautiful white and red vase filled with huge bright red roses, were for me. They had been down there most of the morning and he had called my Voicemail and noted that I said I would not be in until 12:30 today. There was a card that read simply “I love you” and hand written underneath, “Thinking of you often, too bad it has to be this way. –Jesse”.  This little hand written line made me want to cry but at the same time I can’t seem to wipe the smile off my face.   The worst thing about it is that there is more on the way, I can only imagine what he has next for me.  * *Amazed at how much of a romantic Jesse is even when he is 4 States away.**
