Its only some days you know, when you feel really low.....  Anyhow to begin with , I just noticed that if you wanted to keep your head down(on the table),and just relax, people would think that there was something utterly wrong with you. For eg. I had suddenly developed a cold over the weekend (Another of my observations -virus invasions are usually sudden- be it the computer or the human body) and was trying to catch up on some sleep whenI was flooded with questions such as "Whatsthe matter", "Why are you so melancholy" (by Palsy) etc. Thus my whole break was ruined in convincing these guys that I was just plain sleepy.    Anyhow I decided to extend my sleep to the Physics period. As usual it was very boring and Mrs. Shobha Mehta was trying to teach us some God knows what effects , and dictating some notes. So there I was trying to do both things simultaneously. I mean its hardly possible but Soumya nudged me everytime i fell asleep. So this way i could do both things.    Anyhow the joke of the day was , when I was yelling in the break (trying to convince my friends ) Adi commented- "Manisha, do you have vocal chords or is it the distortion of an electric guitar".  Everybody just burst out laughing. Itwas really hilarious at that time.  Anyhow if you havent got the joke , just leave it. Its kind of silly afterwards.    Lastly , I would like to say all the best to Bhav and his team who are organising the debate for class XII (what with debaters such as Vijeta, Roaming saint,...)    Till then,    Hail Achilles !!!
