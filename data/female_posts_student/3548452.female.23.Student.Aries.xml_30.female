Well, it's something new for me. I've done the threesome thing more than once,  but never as a full out and out relationship. But, this kinda seems like it's right. I am just totally into these people... and no I wont use names just yet 'cause they arent here and it's not gonna happen anytime soon (like the next 2-3 months) so there's no need to jinx myself. Meanwhile I'm still in this dilemma over David. And I dont know what happened to my new friend, but he's been kinda m.i.a. so I wil just leave it at that. What's up with the title of this blog posting? I really wanna know how wrong this is for me. I feel like its right... and it's very rare that you meet two awesome people that you wanna be with at the same time. Have you ever had a friend that you never ever wanted that you all of a sudden discovered was kinda hot? Yeah I got a couple of those too. Then there's my situation that's gonna be some drama if I believe what I was told. This is why I dont date friends. Supposedly a friend of mine likes me, but someone else likes them, and they are my friend too... What to do, what to do? Beats me... so I'll just go with the flow and let it be. I'm learning more and more to do that. I'm sorry for making it sound like my ex is just a prude and he's really bland... but I got a whole lot more flava than he's got so, I cant help the truth. LMAO I told him no more bad mouthing him (although I dont consider it badmouthing- it's just the truth) so I'll stop. I"m making the dreaded trip to the doctors next week- I called and made the appointment today, 'cause Scott is bein a dork and has me all paranoid now. *sigh* even though I know I cant have kids, or rather, it's a very slim chance that i ever will, I am going to make sure 'cause there is no way in hell I will be able to explain THAT one away. It'd be a really fucked up Jerry Springer segment- "My baby daddy is my roommates boyfriend and he lives with us and we're one big happy family" yeah, right. Nice, huh? Well, now I'm going to definitely make sure that if I get preggo (which I doubt since I think David cant' have kids or maybe he lied to me  who knows) it will be a complete accident. *snickers* Anyhew, life is pretty damn amazing at this point. I am kinda glad I'm not in love anymore 'cause I"m discovering there's more out there if I will just open myself up to it. *shrugs* I'm discovering that while I'm the best counselor and the best relationship specialist when it comes to others, I'm totally clueless when it comes to myself. Somebody help me please? In other news, I'm totally uncontrollably depressed about my lack of children yet again. I'm 23 and it looks like I might not have kids... at least not at a time when I would want them. I wanna be able to just go thru my career and have my kids in school when I start it, but it's not going to happen. It totally depresses me... all my friends are having babies or have kids, and I'm watching all of them with so much envy it's enough to choke me. It almost makes me want to get checked for endometriosis, but even if I found out I had it, I'm not at a point in my life where kids would be feasable at all... so I'm going to keep on going and cry myself to sleep occaisionally because I feel this maternal instinct that I can do nothing about. I wish sometimes that God would just have mercy on me and let me have just one. I would be happy with that. Then I could adopt some of the kids that I see around here with fucked up moms. That hurts my feelings way more than not bein able to have kids- seein these crackwhores and alcoholics out here doing nothing but stayin knocked up to get assistance and then fuckin the baby's life all up by staying drunk or high the whole time. My roomie's boyfriend has two kids that he's trying to see, and their mom lost em because she was passed out drunk and they were runnin the roads at 2 years old. Nice huh... As if my life couldnt get any worse... I'm sitting here at work dealing with my boss yet again- he thinks if he yells at me for the shit he does, I wont fight back. He thought it was smart to tell me once again he expects me to multi-task as if I'm getting paid the 8 dollars an hour to be the receptionist.... If I were, I'd do that. But as it stands, I'm a work-study student and pretty soon I know he's going to know it. Even though it's going to kill me to not work thru the break, I think I just may find another work study job. I am not dealin with his crap for two more years just for the sake of working close to home and maybe I can get my old job back or something close to what I'm doing now. I'm definitely going to go check. This isnt working... that's what I'm going to do Monday morning as early as possible- while I'm going to pick up my books. And I'm going to get a copy of my actual job description and tape it to his computer highlighted so he can see exactly what my job description entails. He thinks his center should run differently just because he says so, well I will make sure even if I have to call his superiors and complain until they come fix it. *sigh* Another case of liking someone who is partially taken. You know how it feels when you get your heart broken... Like you cant breathe and someone has a lead weight on your chest and there's a lump there too. Sometimes if you sit there long enough feeling that way a sharp pain kind of gets you there and you cry... You play your sappy music and cry yourself to sleep that night wondering what the hell is so wrong with you that you have to be by yourself. In my case, what the hell is so wrong with me that I cant not only keep but find a boyfriend, why do I have to be by myself, there's something wrong with me, I cant have kids..... I'm pitiful, I know. I dont have low self-esteem, but my self pity is just more than I can take some days.  Check out the poem blog too you guys- it may have new poems on it next week.. Probably all my poems will be on it by the end of the week. Laters. I love yas! LEAVE A COMMENT DAMMIT!
