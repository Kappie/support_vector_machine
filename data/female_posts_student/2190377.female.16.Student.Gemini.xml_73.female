There we found out that the guy who always helps us pick out frames is moving on to bigger and better things later this month.  This may not seem like a big deal but  I love  this guy.  In high school he was the weird scrawny kid with long hair and a funny name that later turned into a babe magnet.  (Literally, as evidenced by a halloween costume he had one year... consisting of troves of barbies stuck to a magnet-y suit.)  People used to come up to him and go "ARARARARARARAR" because his name is Deano, pronounced like Dino... from the Flintstones.  Deano Ventura.  How much cooler of a name can you get? If you have a name like that you are obviously destined for stardom.  So he is leaving my very odd optometrist's office to pursue a career in music, inventing, and warehouse management.  Talk about being ADHD.  Apparently his band is going to provide music for CSI this upcoming season... too bad his band isn't called something totally rad like "Deano and the ________" (does it really matter who the other people are? nahhh.)  Tonight I will wake up at 3 AM knowing that somewhere in the wilderness of Manassas there is a 39 year old trapped in a 19 year old's body mountain biking until his legs fall off, hopefully he doesn't run into a deer.  That is the end of my tribute to the dude that picked out my glasses.   In other news, my grandmother had to put Fancy down.  For those of you who didn't have the  privelage  of meeting Fancy, she was my grandmother's decrepid, crotchy, old, Eewok dog.  18 years old.  I think it was actually already dead, but they were using experimental treatment that involves turning your dog into a zombie.... which means I should probably blow up University Drive Veterinary Clinic before tons of monsters created by the Umbrella corporation bust loose.  In all seriousness though, I love you Fancy.  You were a good dog.  R.I.P.  Mostly I feel sad for my gramma cause now she sits at home complaining of dizziness and cries sometimes.  :/
