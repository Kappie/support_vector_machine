We basically spent the whole day going on heaps of rides,feeling sick, then going on heaps more. Ehxcellllent...Later on, i arrivedhome at around 6:15pmand recieved a phone call from Mel asking me to come over 4 the night. After being picked up by a complete stranger from squash, that drove me to Mel's, Beth, Mel and I all went to Cristian City Church for youth group.When we got there, we were totally lost, we soon found Rory. He told us to go downstairs. After going downstairs and following the noise we were greeted at the door by the Tom equivelant. He opened the door for us and said something i didn't quite catch bcoz of the loud music. It was so weird. They had this big room, with music just rumbling in side it. The speakers were like double the size of me, and they had a DJ and all this other random stuff. There was no point trying totalk to each other coz we couldnt hear anything coz of the music. It was like sum random cult night club. lol. Ne way, we wanted to ask Rory when the 'youth group' actually started' but he was not there coz he was a youth leader with the younger youth group. Eventually beth felt sick bcoz of the vibrations so we went into the hallway. After multiple SOS attempts on Beth's mobile, we found ourselves huddled in the corner, all alone. It was quite funny, one guy started coming down the hallway and he goes "Hey!..." then he realised he didnt know us and turned around, that happened 3 times. Luke finally got a hint and called Beth.     We went outside in the cold, so we could hear him. Mel asked for the phone and when Beth handed it to her, Mel bolted inside, up the stairs, down the corridor and into a random seminar room, collapsing onto the tables at the back. Beth and I following. All the while Luke was on the phone like "Beth?....What's happening?....Beth?.....Hello!?...".  After Beth spoke to Luke for another 5 min, we decided to check out the room. It was about the size of 2 of the playgroup rooms next to St. Stevo's. It had a white board up the front, and the room was surrounded with cupboards. It was all pitch black by the way, we could nly see things faintly. Eventually, we found a TV. We turned it on hoping it would work. It did. Yay! We stayed there for like an hour watching Miss Match, and Tru Calling.  During that time i went to the back cupboard labeled "KIDS" and opened it to find a big jar of Starburst Sucks lollypops. Yum... we each took two and settled ouselves back down on the carpet to watch the rest of Tru Calling. It was soo funny. Here we were at CCC, in a seminar room, watching TV, and sucking lollypops we stole from kids. lol. We could still here the faint rumble of sound from downstairs even though the room was soundproof. After a while Guy finally came to pik us up and we went bak to Melly's to sleep over. LOluv, cm
