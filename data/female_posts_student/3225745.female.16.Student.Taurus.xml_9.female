I can see why he wanted to leave but i am just going to miss his funny funny jokes.  I am not that sad im just a little disappointed.  After all, this is just tv.  And recently my life has become too interesting to be too worried about tv.  anyway i was just up and decided to write.  good night i am off to bed.
