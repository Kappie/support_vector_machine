I'm so drained physically and emotionally.  I came home from school today and just slept for like three hours.  It doesn't feel like the end of the year either.  Maybe it's the weather.  But, we only have five days left of school.  I've become stressed over finals since the review sheets are starting to be handed out and I realize I don't remember this stuff.  Luckily, I only have three this semester, since I won't have any tests in my AP classes and I don't think Mr. Powers will make some grandiose test.  I'm ready to be done with homework and tests but I'm not ready to say good-bye to some people.  I thought I was ready but as graduation becomes closer I realize that I don't want to say good-bye.  Realize this is only like three people and as far as the others are concerned if I had my way they'd have their diplomas now and I'd never have to see them again.  Oh, fun story.  I shouldn't have been allowed to drive today on account of I was out of it pretty bad.  But on the way to pick up Megan this morning I totally went through a red light.  It's not like I could have prevented it or anything because I was turning and it turned when I was waiting for traffic to clear so I had to go.  I'm just hoping the nice camera at the top will forgive me.    Some one, please, come peel me off of the wall, I'm lonely!
