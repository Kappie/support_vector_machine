Well here are my views;  I think that Sadam Hussane may or most probably is a terrible man, but we have only been shown what the government and the press want us to know.  ( Sorry been paying 2 much attention in media studies)  So that when push come to shove and good old Tone' asks the country whether we should go forth with America everyone will all say yes, because of the impression of Iraq and its reigime that has been given to them by the press.  But know one actually bothers to look deeper than the news.  I reckon all most all the people that make all the important decisions have never been to Iraq to experience what living is like over there, how poor most people are, so mayby, just mayby people should think about them aswell before they rush into anything. I'm now making myself depressed and questioning wierd things so I'm going to go now.
