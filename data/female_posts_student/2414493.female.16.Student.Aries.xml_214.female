I don't want tomorrow to come because that means after the AP I'll have to get to bio again, but then I want to get the AP over with too.  Waiting to drive is like running and that last stretch and the sprinter's kick that never comes. It's approaching, but you can't force yourself to go faster on that one last leg, and you are stifled. You push in your lungs to try to reach that finish in a grand style, and it just. doesn't. happen.  All of a sudden I feel sad and I don't know why. Not an angry sad but a why am I here? kind of sad. Loneliness hits at funny moments, punctuates silences. The most common one for me is getting out of the shower, wrapped in a towel and just standing there. And then it hits. I got that kind of feeling in English this morning too. And now. Is it deep-seated insecurity? A mind that refuses to fill itself with more efficient thoughts? I am happy, I tell myself. I am surrounded by great people. Life is promising, provided that I put in my share of the work. And yet, sometimes I wonder why this is all happening to me or what this is in the first place. It's love, yes. Not the canned, teenage kind of love but just a profound appreciation of everything I have every day. And then we ask ourselves, what is this love?   All right, enough metaphysical chatter.  My sunburn is peeling, yay.  I need to stop being needy.
