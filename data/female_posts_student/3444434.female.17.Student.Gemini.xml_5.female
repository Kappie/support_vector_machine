I'm glad what happend, happend it opened my eyes and made me see what he really is and what he's really like. I do think he can  be a caring person and that some things were genuine and honestly from the heart, but a large part was just not real. And i see that now and im glad i finally see that. I just think to myself if he is really that kinda person, the kinda person that will intentionally hurt you, he's most definetly not worth it. No one deserves that, i wouldnt wish that upon anyone no matter how heartless or cruel they are. Well maybe i should tell you the story and you might understand what im saying a lil more.  Well..............What happend was shit happend and was said between me jer and him and things and words just got a lil twisted and miss understood and crap. So then josh was a lil mad at me i guess, so me,sar,jer, and him were all suppose to go to a movie and i was gunna buy his ticket kinda as a im sorry thing and that was his idea and shit..and he was gunna forgive me. But then last minute were waiting for him to show his gay ass up and he says im not gunna go I'm goin to Bob's house. OKAY! so i text him and say "thats to bad" he replys with "Maybe 4 u im fine with it". ASSHOLE...there is no need to be fucking mean. I didnt say shit back and was just like fine if thats how your gunna be whatever. So KNOWING im there at his house he comes home at like 3 in the morning....WITH A FUCKING GIRL!!!!!!! I couldnt believe it. OMG i cant believe he just did that. They went straight to his room.  i was just in shock like wow what a jerk i cant believe he would do that. Just a few minutes later I CAN HEAR THEM HAVING SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!!!!!! I just started crying i couldnt believe what i was hearing and the fact i have to sit here and listen to the guy im like in love with, the guy i lost my virginity to, the guy i was just with a few days ago having sex with some chick!!!! screw that. I deserve soooo much better then that....thats TRASH hes TRASH shes TRASH theyr TRASH!!! FUCK THAT! Nobody deserve anything like that. i wouldnt wish that upon anyone. Not even him and thats sad. I just cant believe he intentionally did that he knew i was there. SCrew him! This chick he is talking to the one he flaunted in front of me twice now is MARRIED w/ KIDS and is his BOSS! Real clean josh real clean... That is T-R-A-S-H!! absolutly trash! He disgusts me. But my heart still remember the good things and moment we spent together and i will never forget them or regret them. Every second with him i cherish...every experience i had with him i cherish, i even cherish the fact that he intentionally hurt me cuz i learned alot. BUT HES TRASH!! hehe
