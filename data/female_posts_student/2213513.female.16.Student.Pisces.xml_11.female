Here's a good story from last summer, actually its like two stories in one, 2 for 1 today! Ok, here we go: The last morning of my second week (i was there for a total of three weeks) one of the counselors had decided to sleep through breakfast so my friends and I got permission from the camp director and went to wake him up...with water. All total there was 6 people with pitchers full of water. When we found his cabin we were all cracking up so hard that we woke him up before we got to pour the water on him. Of course we did it anyway! He was so soaked by the time i was close enough to pour the water on him, that i didnt, and just ran out instead. When i saw the look on his face i could tell he was really pissed. We had gotten a bunch of his clothes and books and stuff wet because it was all sitting near his bed. We all ran back to the dining hall and ended up leaving without talking to Flame (the counselor). Welllll the next week he vowed to get us back and said he was going to get ahold of our parents to get their permission to wake us up with water like we did to him. All of us did not want to be woken up that way and so we tried to get him to forget about it. By the end of the week he couldnt get ahold of our parents so he waited till we were waiting around to leave the last morning. My friend Kari and I saw him coming up the trailwith two big pitchers of water and she immeadiately hid behind a tree. All the other people that were with us that hadn't gotten him wet the week before were freaking out thinking he was just going to get anyone. My friend Brennan and I started running down the path behind him when he was distracted but he ended up getting Brennan. After getting Brennan and some other people he only had about half a pitcher left but i still didn't want to get wet! I saw some bluewingers (6 year olds) with a counselor down the trail a little farther and so i decided tohold a little girlhostage while Flame came after me. Iyelled "you cantget a little bluewinger wet!!" as i hid behind this randomkid. Flame and the counselor that was with the bluewingers were just cracking up. Then i started telling Flame how i hadn't even gotten him wet the week before and he called a truce between us. When he poured out the water he had left i came out from behind the kid. lol it might not sound funny, but it really was. Well considering those stories were really long, im going to say "stick a fork in this post, its done!"  *kate
