As of now, we have 67 kids enrolled, but I'm sure we'll get a handful more next week... and a handful more the first week of school.  I'm a little tiffed right now, because I only have 3 other staff members, and apparently I'll be in ratio.  I do not want to be in ratio... that's WAY too much to expect of a site manager with over 50 kids.  So, I'm really (at this point) counting on those other 2 handfuls of enrollment... because that means I get another staff member PLUS a secondary manager.  I have so much stuff to do next week, it's ridiculous.  I have stuff to do at the office M-F again... T-Th is training stuff... Friday I have CPR training/testing for my renewal.  In addition to that, Tuesday morning I have to be at the support center at 8am to pick up stuff to take to the site... yeah... this means I get to drive the truck so that we can get all the baskets there.  :-\  I really HATE driving the truck... this is because it's HOT in Texas, and the truck has no A/C.  :-(  Oh well... such is life, I guess.  I'm really trying to find the positive in everything, though.  I'm excited to go back and see the kids... I've really missed a lot of them, and about 75% of our enrollment is repeat customers!  :-)  I'm also excited about the new program we're trying this year... and I plan on doing a lot of fun things with music and drama and such... The plan is that Friday's will be "free form" meaning, we don't have to do any projects, or homework program, or other things... so we'll be able to put on little programs!  I'm pysched... I think one of the things we're going to do is have a "club" that's like American Idol (because there are a LOT of kids interested in it) and so then on a Free Form Friday, we'll have them perform something for the whole group.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now.  Talk to you peoples later... leave comments... it's good for the brain.  ;)
