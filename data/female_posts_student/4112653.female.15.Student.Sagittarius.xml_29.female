Seeing her reflection in the puddle at her feet, Marion thought she looked unusually pale. Then she realised that blood loss did that to you.    Shuffling along, Marion realised she was rather hungry. Thinking about where to get a good meal, she bumped into a young man.    Mumbling her apologies, Marion noticed that the young man smelt very good. Good enough to eat.    Before she could stop herself, Marion reached up and pulled the young man's head down, tasting the salty sweetness flowing in his veins.
