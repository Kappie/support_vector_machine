I cant tell you what it smells like, but I remember the bottle so well, the black ribbed cap, the pink coil around the straw.  It just looked cool.  This reminds me of my second grade birthday party when my best friend, Diana, got me the Debbie Gibson Electric Youth Tape!  After all my friends left I stayed out on the deck replaying the song and making up this unmatched dance of greatness.  Alas, Debbie Gibson is no more, she's now "Debra Gibson" and she sucks.  But with  urlLink lyrics like this  how could she have faded away so quickly.  I knew every word of that goddamned song and when I get home tonite you bet your sweet ass I'm gonna get it from  urlLink Limewire , the thing is I dont remember "take it fred"....wierd.
