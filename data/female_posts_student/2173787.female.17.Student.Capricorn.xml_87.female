It seems as if somehow, very recently (tonight possibly) I cracked that dam and slowly but surely the crack is widening.  I certainly made myself miserable for no reason tonight, I was sitting laughing with my friends watching an entertaining movie and then...well i don't know what happened.  It would be nice to unravel this web, although I have no idea where it will lead, although most certainly into unchartered territory.    Riding home from Diana's the song Absolutely by 9 Days played over and over again in my head, coming from some dark recess of my brain that stores all of my middle school memories.  I look back in those days and see unhappiness, even though I know that there were days when my life seemed so happy.  I think I'll end this now and probably delete it in the morning...    This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles  How many days in a year? She woke up with hope but she only found tears And I can be so insincere Making the promises never for real As long as she stands there waiting Wearin’ the holes in the soles of her shoes How many days disappear? You look in the mirror, so how do you choose?  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles  How many lovers would stay? Just to put up with this shit day after day How did we wind up this way? Watchin’ our mouths for the words that we say As long as we stand here waitin’ Wearin’ the clothes of the souls that we choose How do we get there today? When we’re walkin’ too far for the price of our shoes  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles  And your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her  This is the story of a girl Whose pretty face she hid from the world And while she looks so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her When she smiles -  Absolutely , Nine Days
