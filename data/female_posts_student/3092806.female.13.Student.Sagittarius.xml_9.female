It brought up loads of different websites but there was one that stuck out from all of the rest. It's a quiz thingy that you can take if you're a teen and if you're wondering if you're fat. I posted the address below, just in case if you want to use it.    urlLink http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/obesity/l/bl_amifat_quiz.htm    It's a pretty cool quiz thingy. Unlike most BMI (Body Mass Index)caculators and things like that, it's more technical. The quiz asks you for how many years and months old you are, etc... Most BMI caculators don't get technical at all. According to this thingy, I'm in the 60.2 percentile. Other caculators would say that I'm in the 75th to 85th percentile. This thing just has to be right, correct? I mean, it asks and uses way more information then the ordinary ones.   My mom thinks that I'm right, that it is much more accurate then the one at the doctor's office. She told me that the one my doctor has is practically ancient or whatever. Besides, this one just feels more trustworthy. After taking this thingy, I feel much better. Perhaps I'm not all that fat.   Anyways, I've gone back to writing stories and stuff again. I took a break from writing things like that for about six months to a year. Now, I'm back and better then ever! Well, not really but you know what I mean, right? At the moment I'm writing two short stories and a HP (Harry Potter) fanfiction that's full of angst. I love writing depressing things... It's a lot of fun... Besides, it allows me to express whatever I'mfeeling.   Well, I'm out.
