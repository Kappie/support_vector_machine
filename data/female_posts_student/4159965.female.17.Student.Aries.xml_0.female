Now it must look really lame for me to post immediately after it, but I've just had a thought about what I'm going to do with this journal. It's a pity that I've created this journal only to rant about my friends and problems.  So, I've decided that I'm going to put everything that's personal in here, whereas the rest of my life, the fun stuff, the online quizzes and things like that will go onto livejournal for the enjoyment of my buddies.  I'm sure that  someone  may notice and ask.  Georgia already knows that I've got a new journal.  She doesn't know where and I don't think this turns up on any searches.  Not Google anyway. My love life has just begun to blossom.  I've got a guy who's interested in me and I'm interested in him.  It's still in the crush stage, so it's still nothing serious. Nonetheless, that, too, will be making an appearance here instead of on LJ.  If there's something that I want to tell Georgia, then I will tell her in person, face-to-face, or in her email.  And here we go... this is going to be a very bumpy ride.
