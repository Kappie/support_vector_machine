On the other hand, it was an advantage of not having the internet around, because the only productive thing I could do was to revise, revise and revise somemore! :) We had 3 tests yesterday, and I was absent from school because I was ill. Thanks to the  antibiotics  my doctor had prescribed me, I am recovering incredibly quickly.     Antibiotics  : Antibiotics are complex substances produced by microorganisms as a byproduct which they excrete. They are used mainly in the treatment of bacterial diseases.  Tah! Enough with biology! Nana and I sat for the test this afternoon and I was rather shocked cos' I didn't quite expect an essay question. Haha. Well, life is full of surprises! Don't you think so? I love surprises, yet I hate to be surprised. Tah! Enough with the crap already pearls... -.-"  Jeremy just called to tell me that William Hung's song is on Power 98 FM!! Oh my goose!! It's totally hilarious!! William Hung even has his personal  urlLink website , you guys should REALLY check it out. It's totally awesome.. I'm not kidding! Haha! If you don't even know who William Hung is, *clears throat*, you should get a life! Wooyeah!  No insults, peace out dudes! XOX :P
