Was that ever good, I totally just stuffed myself cause I had only eaten like a little breakfeast earlier that morning.  Today I was planning to go to church but my mom is like kind of against it I guess because like she kept persuing me not to go.  Because well there was this water main break and it flooded my sisters house so now I have to help them move their stuff from their house to our garage or else the storage fees will be very expensive!  And well right now they can't even live in their house because it is like ruined all down stairs and the walls are starting to cave in.  So well they bought a 5th Wheel to live in during everything and then in the Winter they will probably live with Jim, which is Ben's mother's boyfriend.  Kind of confusing but honestly I am not to crazy about Jim and all.  And well Ben's dad passed away from Cancer on Friday night and yeah even since I applied for some jobs I've been having second thoughts - which is like NOT a good thing at all.  I guess I just still realize how important everything else really is to me, and I guess it kind of lets me know where my priorities are at the moment.  But well I am just concned about the time I will have available because most people don't take as long as I do to like finish work or study and things like that.  And well during the summer I sort of began to maybe question that like maybe there is something wrong with me.  I do get good marks and all but I don't think many people realize the countless hours I spend trying to figure something out or all the times I have cried because I tried and tried to figure out math and it just doesn't make sense.  Sometimes I think I might have some kind of  disability like associated with learning but when even I mention that people just tell me that I am crazy but I am not sure what to think I mean maybe I am crazy but I wish I knew why I cry like a million times per week and everything NEVER and mean never comes easily.  I have to work for all things and let me tell ya I work my ass off and yeah only I know truly what I go through.  But I don't think I am crazy, I really think that maybe I could possibly be right, but I suppose there is no way to know for sure and everyone has this ideal in their head that I am some kinda really smart girl.  And yeah so maybe I am smart in their eyes but if only they knew a little more and felt all the feelings and went through all the experiences I've been through.  Especially when I consider how hard driving was for me to learn and I even did and extra class of drivers ED and like I still got a 70% and I was suppose to have 75% to pass.  So well I am putting of going for my license until about next year because I don't need the stress of driving in my life too.  But well yeah I don't know what to think when it comes down to about everything.  When I was a kid I never could count money or tell time very well, and I remember always being in some kind of room working with this lady who helped my learn how to count by tens.  And well it's not like math had even been easy, all my life it has been hard and like I read that sometimes disabilities are life long.  Sometimes I think that maybe someone knows something I don't, I mean maybe I do have some sort of problem but no one wants to tell me because maybe the way I would feel like I dunno maybe my parents or something, if anyone were to know anything it would probably be them.  But then again I might just be thinking way too much.  But I mean when I think about all the difficulties with everything it makes sense that it could be possible for me to have some kind of disability involving learning well at least in my mind it makes sense but people usually just think the opposite.  I never thought school or driving or anything was suppose to be soooo hard but I dunno maybe it's not just me and mayeb their are others who feel the same way.  I guess I will never really know for sure though and I just have to go along and do my very best because that is all I can really do.
