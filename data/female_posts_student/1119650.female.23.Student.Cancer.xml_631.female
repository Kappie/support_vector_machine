I've been pretty busy the last few days trying to tie up some loose ends with UConn stuff, considering a change of departments at work, some craziness on the friend front (as I'm sure you all saw from my last stoopit posts), seeing the boy off to Canada for the weekend for his hockey tournament and just generally trying to preserve my mental health.    I've lost 5 pounds, so I'm feeling happy about that, the sun is back to shining, I've spent some well needed time with my kitties these last few days and I'm painting my boring white walled room this weekend.  Its gonna be periwinkle-ish with a bright purple focus wall.  I've also commissioned the boy to repaint my snowboard deck (I finally settled on a design...photos will come when its done) and make some art for my focus wall at home.  Unfortunately he's CRAZY allergic to kitties and seeing as I have six he can't come over and acutally paint a mural on my wall like I had wanted, but we're gonna take 4 big canvases and have him paint on those and then hang them, it will rock your socks of when you see the pics!  I want to say Happy Birthday to the lovely Missy (even though it was yesterday).  I hope it was a good day and you got lots of strappy heels and cute dresses to get you through this next year (c:  Thats gonna do it for me today, but if you can get out and enjoy the sunshine your brain will thank you.
