It’s one of those days that you know no matter what you changed,  the outcome would be the same.  Yes, it was one of those days. 	 One of those days that you can’t ever stop thinking about,  but no matter how hard you try,  you can’t talk about.  When time goes on,  and life continues,  but the pain inside never goes away.  It’s one of those days. 	 	 I know we have all had one of these days.  I, myself, have had many.  But this one most definately beats out all of the other days like today.  I think my day beats everyone elses day like today.  I could argue why it does,  but what difference would it really make?  I can’t go back in time, and change  all the little things I could do differently that day.  My only option is to go on.  My only problem is, I dont want to.
