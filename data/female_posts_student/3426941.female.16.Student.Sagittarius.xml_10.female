Second:Yay! my boob didn't pop out of my costume. Third: Yay! the hot tub is fixed so I can have friends over!  Okay. Now for my bitch session.  This morning I recieved a call from Ryan who proceeded to ask me if I was okay, told me that I had sent him an email which was incoherent and said something about me taking valium and od ing on it.   Then when I checked my phone, I found that I had like, nineteen new messages from a lot of my friends calling me to ask me if I was okay, if I was alive, if I needed them to come over and help me, and if I needed an ambulance called to my house.   Let me just say, that the person who is now my least favorite person in the world who knows my password can just go jump in the Pacific ocean and get their limbs bitten off by a shark.(And his teeth are rather dull.)  If anyone else who reads this blog recieved this hoax email under my name, it is false, and it did not really occur. Someone thought it would be rather amusing to scare the crap out of my friends, and therefore interfered with my email adress.  Anyway,   I am tired like crazy, so I am going to retire right this instant. Ryan, again I apoligize for the email which scared the crap out of you. Promise it won't happen again.  PS: This "friend" does not know about my blog, nor will I be telling her about it. Therefore, I can and will speak freely about her.  That's all folks.  BTW, if you want to read the Eponine Fanfic I wrote, I can email it to you.  And Dan, yes, it's wonderful.  "The play's the thing!" -Shakespeare
