I was on the way to my dad's on  Main street  in  menomonee falls , and it goes from 45 to  25  in a matter of about hmmmmm  10  feet. So yeah, as I'm applying the brakes to slow down, this eager beaver cop pulls a 180 from the other side of the street, lights flashing, siren blaring, the whole deal...yeah, so anyway, $120 later, I still say that I was slowing down, but that wasn't good enough. O well, I went straight to my dad and told him, and he was cool with it...he told me not to tell my mom though, and to act like I forgot about it. What good is that though? I have to tell my mom everything so all throughout the movie  Miracle  (the longest movie  EVER ) with  Sarah ,  Alli  and  Andrew , all I can think about is the stupid ticket. Yeah, after they left I told my mom. She said she was glad I told her, and she believed me. So yeah, we're all just glad that my dad's paying for it, and I'm glad that I'm not punished except for the ticket! Yeah, I suppose it was a rather good day...it just better not happen again, or my name is no longer  Miss Chauffer . lol, well hope that you are doin better than me...o and don't tell your mother about this, or you'll never get to drive with me (believe me, I'm a good driver, ask Sarah Wier!) goodnight all, ~kendra
