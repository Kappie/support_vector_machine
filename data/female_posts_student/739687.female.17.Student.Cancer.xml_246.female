And, well, technically it is, but I have this feeling of running out of time. Isn't it odd? I feel like if I don't take care or certain things, then they'll never get done. There's alot I'd like to say right now...but I'll get around to it. All in good time. Some of it is good, some is bad, and all of it is to my benefit. Things are going to start working out for me...because I'm going to make them. And not in the raving, evil bitch style that some people prefer...but I'm going to do things the right way. What's funny is I'm confusing myself right now. My head is lost right now.  I don't think I will ever understand how people can so willingly shelter themselves from the world. How they can be so judgemental of people, and of actions and things that they refuse to even understand. Shame on you mindless followers. People are hypocrites. They claim to be so unique, and insist that their minds are so superior and different and they think unlike anyone else. Well guess what?  You aren't special.   You act as though you're some connoiseur of the world, while you refuse to even give anything a try. How much can one actually know without first hand experience? Very little.  When you refuse to have an open mind, and to be objective, you simply become another mindless follower.  Well, I have kickboxing in a little bit, hooray! Actually it's in like 2 1/2 hours. Haha.  Mmm, times are good. They could be better, and hopefully they will be. But nevertheless, I'm content.  Be open-minded, crazies. And love your local hippie.
