"Tuesday Morning" by michelle branch  I remember stormy weather The way the sky looks when it's cold And you were with me Content with walking So unaware of the world  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I don't wanna go Tuesday morning In the dark I was finding out Who you are  I took your picture While you were sleeping And then I paced around the room If I had known then That these things happen Would they have happened with you?  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I don't wanna go Tuesday morning In the dark I was finding out Who I was  And if you turned around to see me and I was gone You should have looked outside your window 'Cause the sun was coming up The sun was coming up  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Tuesday morning In the dark We were finding out Who we are Tuesday morning In the dark We were finding out Who we are
