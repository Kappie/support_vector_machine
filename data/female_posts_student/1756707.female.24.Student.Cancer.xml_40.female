I've been thinking more lately about purposes for blogging -- I mentioned already my six different blogs and their different purposes and audiences.  But I know there's more than that -- I know this because I've had other blogs for different purposes in the past -- one for my novel-in-progress, that served as sort of free internet backup of the text in case my laptop crashed, for example.  I wonder how practical/feasible it would be for us to do some kind of survey of bloggers, the reasons why they blog, the reasons why they blog where and when they do -- would we have to only focus on people with multiple blogs?  That in itself could be a research piece -- writing-in-action/practice kind of thing, sort of a "this is a new genre with new purposes and audiences and motives for action, and this is how those things can work, these are the possibilities for this."  I'd also like to see how *much* writing is done on blogs, in terms of quantity.  I'm thinking about my students' discussion board forums, which aren't technically blogs, but are somewhat analagous.  My 930 class has posted 80 some messages on one board this week, which is literally four times as many as they're required to do.  I'd love to see how much writing that adds up to -- they are already probably over the page requirement for Comp I classes, and it would be neat to see how much work I can get them to do when I make it relevant.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Ok, so we have all these multiple ideas going and diverse threads -- what do we do with all this?  (Not necessarily a question to be answered now, but something to think about.)
