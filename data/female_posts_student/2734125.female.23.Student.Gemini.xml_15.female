I had forgotten the way my mind does gymnastics when I feed it constantly with real information, real ideas and real thoughts.  I think that it had been over burdened with emotional fluid, and that has drained somewhat as the weeks of education have taken up electric space.  The other day Dylan and I were walking around campus (all of my most surreal experiences seem to happen with her) and we walked into tree gullies and hidden dark spaces.  I was lovely.  I wore short sleeves and never thought about cold.  We walked and saw a boy putting his bike against the curve of a door before running into a building.  We watched him think hard about if he should lock it, or just dash in, trusting the universe.  He looked at Dylan and I and decided these ambling girls were no threat, so ran in.  I turned to Dylan and said, "I would really like to move his bike just to the other side of the door."  As I finished talking she dashed up to the door and went into the hallway about ten feet, gave me the signal and I moved it.  Then we ran giggling around the building.  Was this act of subtle defiance really funny?  Or necessary...?  At any rate, it was well worth it.  Then we found a building with a fountain in it that I had been told about.  Dyl told me that it used to be a women's dorm and were the fountain was there used to be a pool.  One night boys (GASP) snuck in and went swimming naked in the pool.  The dorm mom got so up in arms the next day she had the pool paved over.  Urban college mytharific.  Then,  I took the bus home, buying a tulip on the way.  As I rode I watch the tulip, its subtle soft and pointed smooth.  When I bought it the petals were closed, and as I rode, the twenty min ride, they opened. When a tulip just opens it smells sweet like summer and honey and dream wool cats.  The sun was beginning its slow decent, and the day felt truly lived.  I walked from the stop a little chilly, and considered the bright yellow with splinters of red that were the petals, and the glow of life within the plant...
