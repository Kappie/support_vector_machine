We had to sleep in a tent all nigh with cat, Chloe, Sophie and me!, it was pissing it down and the wind almost blew the tent down! (it stayed up though! - just!) The night before we had to cook our own dinner on a really little crap stove thing! It took ages and we didn't get to eat much! Then the next day we woke up at 4.30 because of the wind. We had to take Sophie to the loo because she was scared! After we went to the loo Ellie m went and the little toilet tent fell down on her! It was relay funny!! He he. Anyway we packed up our tent which was wet and then had breakfast of hot choc and black toast (not because we burnt it but because we cooked it on the crappy stove!) and then we took our very very very heavy bags up a steep hill to the obelisk! and then back down the hill again (once we had wrapped Alice in a orange blanket because we had to practice emergencies - you see Ali fell down a rabbit hole and broke her leg! Not really though! LOL) when we got back to school we had to wash everything that was covered in mud and then go to school concert rehearsals and the concert. We got to bed at about 11.pm which  doesn't seem much but we were up at 4.30 that morning! Then they wanted us awake for school this morning! - fat chance LOL. Anyway that was my weekend! eventful huh?  we finish school this week on friday - a well earned rest i think! but i am going skiing so i will have to be active for another week! ugh! anyway i have loads of free time and nothing to do - actually i have 2 preps to do but i cant be bothered so i will do them later! he he.  blog later heather
