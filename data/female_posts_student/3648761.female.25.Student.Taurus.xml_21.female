Talk to my Christine today, she left Florida at noon. And she is driving to Atlanta and staying at her moms house. Then she is leaving early mourning tomorrow, and it's about a 12hour drive from georgia to Wisconsin. I can't wait to see her. My job really sucks by the way. I hate being a receptionist, but at least it's a paycheck. Only 1month and a half till I am once again a full time college student Yea!
