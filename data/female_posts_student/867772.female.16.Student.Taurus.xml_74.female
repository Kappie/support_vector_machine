I't weird when it's someone you knew: http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/021/metro/BC_High_junior_16_dies_in_car_crash+.shtml  Not only someone you knew, but someone you cared about.  Not cared,  care .  Someone who stands out. In a good way. Many good ways.  Someone you like more each time you talk to them.  Someone you want to get to know better. A few weeks in a playwriting class isn't enough.  Someone who's definitely a someone.  It's like a slap in the face. It makes you think about so much, and re-evaluate your entire life.  Ryan, I didn't know you for very long or very well, but what I do know is that something like this can't happen to someone like you.  But it did.  You'll live on, kid. And yeah, it does look like japanese.  So, I know I "don't have to", but I don't care. I now dedicate this entire blog to Ryan Flannery.
