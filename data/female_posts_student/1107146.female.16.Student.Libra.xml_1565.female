Thus I didn't include everything I wished to say because I knew you would point your former comments out.  Remember my chronic paranoia these days...to say that I didn't trust people before all this shit hit the fan would be correct, but now consider it severely amplified.  Huge trust issues, so please bear with me.  Nevertheless, I'm over it all now. 2) Am I insane in thinking that I let you all know when I would be back?  I could have sworn that I posted or e-mailed or TOLD someone when I'd be getting back.  If not, then I apologize for my negligence, my being an ass, and the subsequent hindrance of your making plans.   3) Anything but those days that we're mentoring should work fine.   4) Please call me soon.  I've been trying to get in touch with you for quite some time but neither of our schedules have been working out favorably for that.  Maybe I'm a little testy, because I felt neglected.  Stupidly, I admit, but still.  As for everyone else:  Rosie:  I was glad to see you today @ The Torture Chamber/ Chasm Leading Straight To Hell/ School.  It's been a while.  Will: Again, glad to know you liked the postcard.  Your e-mail was definitely diverting and I enjoyed it.    Josh: You don't talk too much.  I liked hearing from you, too.   Now having dispensed with the formalities, let me please reiterate that I apologize for overreacting, if that was what I did, but I've learned that the only person I can really trust is myself and I'm working on extending that to my mom and to you all.  It is working pretty well...but hell, we all have setbacks sometimes, right?  Just tolerate me.  Hopefully this will be the last time I have to discuss the "D" word on this site.  I'll reserve that for mine.  ~Z
