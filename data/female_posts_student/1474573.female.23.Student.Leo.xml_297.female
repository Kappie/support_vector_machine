After the test was over, she gave us the answer key to figure out how we did and to use as a study guide for the final.  I know I definitely got about 3-4 answers wrong and a partial credit on 2 others...But, if I remembered all my answers correctly, I may have pulled off a B on this test which  COULD  bring my total average up enough so that I would be able to opt out of taking the final after all!!  (crossing fingies!)  She took our email addresses and phone numbers to tell us our grades by this weekend.  I'll keep everyone posted.
