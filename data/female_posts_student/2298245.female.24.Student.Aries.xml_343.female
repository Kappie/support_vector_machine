It's always like this when a semester ends, I just find myself wandering aimlessly, unsure of what to do with myself.  As a consequence, I end up doing nothing.  Not that I've done nothing.  I've been working.  I'm doing research for two professors this summer.  For one of them, I've been researching tax malpractice cases.  For the other one, I've been looking into motive in criminal law.  It's been fun and interesting so far.    I've also done other things.  I've rented some movies, and watched a lot of TV, and gone to see a movie with one friend and a play with another.  I also finally got all of my grades, and not only did I not fail, I had my best semester yet in law school, much to my incredible surprise.  I also think I've finally worked out my schedule for the fall, and it will once again, I believe, only be three days a week of class.  Woo hoo!  That said, some of the classes are not going to be the fun things I planned on taking, basically because I think taking some other more practical things are more important.  But we shall see.  I have a little time to change my mind.    I've also been taking vitamins, and I finally went to the grocery store so that the living off of takeout existence has ended for the time being.  And I'm holding my breath hoping my loans come in soon so that I will be broke no longer, and can stop living off my credit cards, temporary though that state of life might be.    I haven't watched the news at all, or kept up with world events.  I haven't had the heart or the stomach for it, to tell you the truth.  But I will be picking this back up, as it is my civic responsibility to keep myself informed and to talk about the things that are really important not just to me, but to the world at large.    I will also be trying to start an exercise regimen, hoping that getting out into the glorious summer days with energy and vigor will help lift my spirits a bit, and prepare me for the trials and tribulations and the business ahead.  Summer school is fast approaching, and then I will have not only work, but class to read for, and starting this Friday, writing competition papers to grade, so my work will be cut out for me.  Never fear, I also plan healthy doses of fun along the way.  A friend is coming to visit soon, and my family soon after, as well as my last summer o' fun with Christina before she leaves to go live with the crazy country music lovin' folk in Nashville.  I should be busy enough to stay out of trouble, at the very least.
