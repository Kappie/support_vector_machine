Sounds like you had a blast.  Doubt that any of you could see me as a wench (go wenches!) or fairy or other mystical creature, but you have all seen me do the "Bend and Snap," so I suppose miracles can happen.  I will try to remember to call ya, Linds.  Wondered why I hadn't heard from you for a while.  By the way, has anyone seen/heard from Will?  He seems to have been absent from this Blog lately.  Packing for my Vegas trip tomorrow...enough said.  ANYway, better go, but when you see what time I posted you will most definitely realize that I have become a summer night owl.  Au revoir, all.   ~Z
