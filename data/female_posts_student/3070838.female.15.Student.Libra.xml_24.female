Lol, can't I like, blow the electricity out of my house if lightening hits the computer? muhaha. Well, today we went riding for like 4 hours. It was HOT TODAY and just think, it was only 80F. Wait till it's 100. Won't that be shit loads of fun? Well I just took a "Who's your boyfriend?" test that really had nothing to do with that but, lol, I found out i am mysterious, loving, romantic, and athletic and that if I didn't send the retarded thing to 15 people in 5 minutes and 51 seconds Courtney would get into a fight with me. lol. Bring it on. muhaha. Yesterday I hid eggs for Mrs.Ridley's kids Sam and Katherine. They are so sweet! And guess what? They gave me a little model of a PT Cruiser. How sweet? Lol. Sucking up? Just kidding. They're so sweet. I'm trying to find random people to talk too. This is so fun. :P Luv u all, Philly PS: Always believe in a thing called love. :o)
