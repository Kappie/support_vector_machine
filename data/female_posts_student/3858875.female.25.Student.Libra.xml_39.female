We're just putting on our program now, and I do take a personal interest in it. Plus, we hired ten fantastic people to run the program.   Nevertheless, it feels like the weight of the world is off of my shoulders, and I can start to deal with more important things (like getting my papers to get into the US!)   The resignation meeting was incredibly impersonal. Because my term was coming up at the end of august anyway, I guess there was no real surprise that I was heading out. But i didn't get an exit interview or anything that I expected... not even a 'we're sorry you're going,' 'thanks for your work here' or 'good luck in Texas'. Wankers.
