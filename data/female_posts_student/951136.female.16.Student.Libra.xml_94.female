Shes given a new name, maybe even a male name, she has her beautiful long flowing hair shorn off; she wears old fashioned clothes, which, among other things, completely desexualize her.  In fact, she'll never know the joys of sex or of having children; she's gone through a bizarre ritual in which shes symbolically married the founder of her movement, even though hes long dead.  She gets up before dawn every day, chanting and praying.  Shes cut off from the outside world.  Her family will rarely, if ever, see her again.         And her family is proud of her because, of course, theyre a traditional Catholic family and their daughter has become a nun.         It's all a matter of perception."  and something else...      "Why is it that Haworth, Chader, and others put so much emphasis on the actively deceptive techniques of movements in the recruitment/ conversion process?  There may be many reasons, but two possible ones will be considered here.       First, there seems to be a deep, underlying belief that no one in their right mind would join such a movement, with its strange beliefs and odd practices.  A moment's reflection will reveal the inherent conservatism of such an attitude.  Millions of people believe weird and wonderful things, which more sane and sensible people (note the assumptions!) 'know' to be rubbish.  Who decides what is an acceptable belief and what is a crazy one?  What is unconventional in one context is perfectly natural in another.  There might even be a certain cultural prejudice here with echoes of imperialism; at its extreme, it might be called racism.  Its alright for an Indian to be a Hindu, but not for a white Surrey stockbroker who has a good English education, dammit, to start chanting 'Hare Krishna'."
