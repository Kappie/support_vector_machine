I never celebrate Mother's Day. * A sinister laugh* My whole family never celebrate Mother's Day as 1) Exam period 2) There is no need to 3) There is SARS 4) I loathe (did I spell it correctly?) it! The reasons are reasonable, right? Oh, and if you watch channel U's Ready, Steady, Go!, which is about a competition where two contestants and hosts will go around Singapore's flats to get their items which they need and sponsered by Cold's Storage. A very funny show, the hosts were funny and that adds up the atmosphere. Althought I was able to watch for only 30 min, I was praticularly laughing my head off *Ha Ha*  *_* But I am still very loyal to Channel 5 and 8's shows. *cross my fingers*
