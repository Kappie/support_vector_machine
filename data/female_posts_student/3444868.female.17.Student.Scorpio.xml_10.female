Those are some hyper little kids.  Dan told me to play a lot of games to get them halfway calmed down.  It was amazing how calm they were compared to the other two days when Sherri wasn't there.  Today she left early, so I got to be in charge again.  The youngest kid is named Brady, and he's incredibly hyper (go figure), but he semi-listens to me.  He came and gave me a hug before he left.  Last night I went to see Saved with my mom and sister.  It was pretty good.  And today we took my dad out for an early father's day lunch.  That was my life this week.
