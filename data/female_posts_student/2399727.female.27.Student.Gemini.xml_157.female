I have both visual and auditory hallucinations in this state.  Different than the monster/dog crushing my chest hallucination experienced by so many people including this  urlLink blogger  but actually quite terrifying anyway.  At least it means I'm heading towards sleep, though.  Most of the time I am an insomniac.   Got a call from CAL centre.  I have an appointment next Tuesday.  I've only been waiting 15 weeks ...   More to come...
