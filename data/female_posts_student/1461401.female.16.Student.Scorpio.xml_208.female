I was over 20 minutes late to school. It wasn't till 2:30 that I actually went. Mom told me that it's not good for a person with a 100 degree temperature to go to school. I suppose. Today's been so strange though, it like I've been walking around in a daze. I knew I was walking down that hall, but I couldn't feel it. I knew I was moving, but I couldn't remember why. It was like everything was fake, the only thing that was real was the terrible heat radiating from my bones that surrounded my body and stuck to every inch of my skin. The unbearable feeling of such heat, more fever induced fun. Today I missed at least two tests, (geometry, french, and possibly world history), getting back my paper from Mrs. Dunn, and Alex. But then about two hours ago, my doorbell rang, and there was a very silly boy there waiting to give me a hug. Thank you alex.   heeheehee, dork
