I was going into World History class, and I didn't know anything about the test that day, and I was thinking about faking sick but somehow I just decided not to.   Oh and then I was in someone's backyard and they had a pool, and they asked me to get some sort of noteboook or binder out of the bottom of the pool. I had my contacts in and I tried to go down and get it and I had to squint to see what was goingon. I know there ismore but I don't remmeber.
