(wow those are THE coolest nicknames ever.)  so guys... sup...  aaah i'm so tired.  times 2 .  ok so that was my blog... tune in next time, for another episode of "shut the f-ck up kate and stop trying to blog, cuz you SUCK.". that's all folks.  i see a blank notebook page, and its my life and  there is nothing I can think to write- i fear the thought of symmetry  kayte.
