Umm... *sigh* My grandpa called this morning aorund 9, saying that my grandma had to be taken to Kaiser in an ambulance because she was having trouble breathing. My mom started freaking out immediately and so she went over there... I don't know, I am really worried.  I hate to say this, but I am more worried about my mom freaking out then my grandma.  The way I see it is that my Grama has already gone through so much pain; so anything to help relieve it is a plus... but my mother... *sigh* she's nutso.  Mer. I'm afraid. Damnit.
