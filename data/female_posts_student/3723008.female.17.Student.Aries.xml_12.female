It's my last night with my babies... although hmm, 2 people told me not to cut my hair... I am.. its just a trim... I hope they don't cut off too much.. I'll be doing that tomorrow.. My dad is taking me to get my hair cut!!!! Who woulda thunk it. Ok, so I was talking to Aleyya last night, and I realised that we both needed a girl's day... so today was that day... Aleyyo, Saara, Ria (Saara's friend) and I went to Gulf... then to Jenny's... then um back to Gulf.. haha.. It was so nice.. And we saw Hana looking all cute n stuff in her little uniform.. hehe.. Once again I was tempted by the body piercing/tattoo parlour... but.. I must not give in.. I will wait for their permission.. Or my first year in UWI... whichever comes first... haha.. They're in the final stages of cleaning Michael's room.. it still makes me sneeze... Hmm.. After looking at Spidy2 again yesterday, without ANY abuse ( *ahem :) ) .. or txting... I started to like it. Its nice. The most recent celebrity crush... Celina Jaitley?.. wowie.. and umm.. Drew Fuller... hello man.. Since I was KICKED out of the soloers crew from some MORONS .. :).. me n aleyya n saara gonna start a boy-haters thing... hahahaha... we so cool.. hahahaha... The little thing up there ^^ was something I wrote... on Tuesday night?.. Well part of something.. I was all ... not nice.. again.. I find this not-nice thing happening to me too much.. and well I couldn't sleep... so I wrote.. Danah says that it made sense, but I don't think it did... I wrote like.. 3 pages of shit.. just shit.. haha.. but it made me feel better.. so it served its purpose.. I'll never show it to anyone though ... ahahaha.. well besides Danah.. I got pics today, from Michael's confirmation .. and the film we wasted.. ahaha... mom said that i looked hungry =\.. i just find i look greezy... Hehe.. one day of liming with foor again and i start talkin like her .. Her birthday is next week.. she may have something... and I already know what I'm gonna wear... its a special surprise muhahahaha.. I'll take pics ... ahahahaha.. It gonna be so fun. Speshally if she gets the trampoline.. *sigh*... "main hoon na"..... not anymore... I'm gone.. oh.. all my old Spanish books from form 3 are on a pile on the floor in the living room and its depressing... but funny.. ahaha.. damn you spanish people!... byeeeeeeeeeee :)     In Aeternum..
