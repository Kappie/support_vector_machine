Then one day when she was out to  lunch  David proposed! She accepted, but then had to leave because she had  a meeting in 20 min. When she got to her office,she noticed on her  computer  she had some e-mail's. She checked it, the usual stuff from her  friends,  but then she saw one that she had never gotten before. It was  this poem.  She simply deleted it without even reading all of it. BIG MISTAKE!  Later  that evening, she received a phone call from the police. It was  about DAVID! He had been in an accident with an 18 wheeler. He didn't  survive .  CASE 2: Take Katie Robinson She received this poem and being the  believer that she was, she sent it to a few of her friends but  didn't  have enough e-mail addresses to send out the full 10 that you must. Three  days   later, Katie went to a masquerade ball. Later that night when she  left to get to her car to go home, she was killed on the spot by a  hit-and-run   drunk driver.  CASE 3: Richard S. Willis sent this poem out within 45 minutes of  reading it. Not even 4 hours later walking along the street to his  new   job   interview with a really big company, when he ran into Cynthia Bell,  hissecret love for 5 years. Cynthia came up to him and told him of her  passionate crush on him that she had had on him for 2 years.  Three days later, he proposed to her and they got married. Cynthia  and  Richard are still married with three children, happy as ever!  This is the poem:    Around the corner I have a friend,  In this great city that has no end,  Yet the days go by and weeks rush on,  And before I know it, a year is gone.  And I never see my old friends face,  For life is a swift and terrible race,  He knows I like him just as well,  As in the days when I rang his bell.  And he rang mine but we were younger then,  And now we are busy, tired men.  Tired of playing a foolish game,  Tired of trying to make a name.  "Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on Jim  Just to show that I'm thinking of him."  But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes,  And distance between us grows and grows.  Around the corner, yet miles away,  "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today."  And that's what we get and deserve in the end.  Around the corner, a vanished friend.  Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell  them.  Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what they  mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time it  might be  too late.  Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close  to  your friends and family, for they helped you make a better person  that   you   are today.
