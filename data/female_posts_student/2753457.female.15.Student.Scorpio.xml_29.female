I cannot even believe that third quarter is almost over.  That is so weird to me.  Seems like I just got here. Yesterday was not so blah though.  My dad took Mary Alice and me to Moore Square.  The St. Patrick's Day parade was going on, but we mostly just walked around and talked.  I think we missed most of it.  Oh, well.  We went to Subway and Cream "N' Bean, and we met up with Charlie and his family later.  It was pretty cool.  It seems like it's been forever since I got to really talk to Mary Alice.  Then my mom took me to see "The Triplets of Belleville" at the Varsity in Chapel Hill, which I LOVED.  It was not really what I expected.  Then again, I'm not sure what I expected.  There were times when I laughed out loud, and everyone stayed through the credits.  It amazes me, the kind of thought that goes into a production like this that makes the animation seem more real, and yet surreal.  And there's nothing like a good foreign film.  I wish it had won the award for Best Animated Feature Film.  I haven't been to the Varsity since I saw "Monsoon Wedding" last year as "research" for my social studies project on Indian culture.  It's a cool little theater. All I've done today is eat a couple pancakes.  I think I'll go start my homework.
