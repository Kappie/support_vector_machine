Now I can spend tonight reading like I should, and I can figure out what I really want to write and not pump out some crap thing. Yay. Now I'm going to make something interesting for dinner... I'm thinking mexican food.  In other news, I spent this weekend feeling overweight: Jerm's already excessively thin sister lost 15 pounds going vegetarian. She's like a size 2 now, and she's my height. I used to be so thin, and ate whatever I wanted, and now that's catching up with me, especially my terrible lack of physical activity. I just need to work out more and eat better... easier said than done, I know. And please don't tell me that I'm too thin anyways, because I don't feel as healthy and strong as I used to, I'm not as connected to my body anymore, and I think once I regain some of that, I have a much healthier body image. But damn, that girl's weight loss is enough to give me an eating disorder. If it weren't for my lack of will power, I would totally be anorexic. Except that whole not eating thing sounds uncomfortable. And I have enough issues with vomit that I think bulimia just wouldn't work out. I think I might have to go the obsessive exercise route, which sounds better, because people won't think I'm sick, and I can feel superior to the weaklings who don't eat, right?
