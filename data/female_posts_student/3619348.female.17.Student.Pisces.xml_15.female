This is todays, and its not good for my health.  *Barely Breathing*  By Duncan Sheik       I know what you’re doing, I see it all too clear I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears You really had me going, wishing on a star But the black whole that surround you are heavier by far I believe in your confusion, you were so completely torn Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born  Theres not much to examine, theres nothing left to hide, You really can’t be serious, if you had to ask me why   I say goodbye…   Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay  Everyone keeps asking, whats it all about?   I used to be so certain, and I can’t figure out What is this attraction, I only feel the pain Theres nothing left to reason, and only you to blame Will it ever change?   Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay  I’ve come to find, I may never know Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? I rise above or sink below With every time, you come and go  Please don’t, come and go  Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay
