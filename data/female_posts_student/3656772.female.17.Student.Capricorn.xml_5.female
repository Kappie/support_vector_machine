So after the Charleston lessons, we drove back up to my house where we had dinner, laughed a lot, and now he's working on his Calculus homework and I'm...ermm... "studying" for my grammar test...with none of the things I actually need to study...I'm gonna fail, yeah. But he lets us retake, so I suppose thats okay, it's just gonna be a hassle.  Everyone keeps asking Matt and me if we're going out. They all seem to _know_ that we are...no matter what we tell  them. *rolls her eyes* Cause, ya know, they would know better than the both of us. *Sighs* He's taking me to prom, cause the girl he asked said no ;) Its alright though, cause we're just good friends, and he wanted to go with omeone. So I've got a cute dress (god, I just said  the word _cute_..someone shoot me...).    Of late, I just got dumped by Colin...not sure why, we were dating for what...two weeks? Not even? I don't get it, he really didn't give me a reason, and that ate away at me for some time, but now...I'm over it. Or at least, as over it as I'm going to be. I liked him a lot, yeah, but whatever his reason, I have finally realized that it just wouldn't have worked out. The good thing is I've come to terms with that.   Uhmm....So I'm going back for the social dance in about ten min, and I'll be home late again, sweaty, tired, and happier than I ever am with anyone.
