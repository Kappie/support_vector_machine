Why can't I say What i Want to? It makes No sense To me Anymore. Nothing does. I want To cry Out for Help, but My own Hand covers My mouth Into silence. I'm a Hopless case. I can't Run. I know That now. A ringing Telephone must Be answered. But not A call For help. A button On my Cellphone helps Me with That.   "Ignore"
