THe Life goes on.. speeding by. the rocky road ahead.. never seemed to end.. it just goes on and on..  maybe the Lord just wants  to give us this test? to show our true colours... to allow us to show our strength..  Life entwines round the human soul.. no one can change it for it has been planned. Mastermind..... the river of life  On and On... the road... endless as it seems.. grants ur the chance.. to live our dreams...  In denial.. i crawl up to the cliffs.. realising that the river.. entwined with our souls.. goes on and on...
