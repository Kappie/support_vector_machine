No se que va a pasar, solo se que por ahora me aferro al dolor mintiendome a mi misma, creyendo en una ilusion que dejo de existir. El mundo exterior se desvance a cada instante y huyo a la oscuridad.   The pain I submerged deep in my heart screamed and was revived. For all that is precious, I won't turn away from pain any more. The town sinks into blue darkness and a sigh that entraps the wind knocks on the sleepless window. Alone, I wander around in the deep maze. A faint hope, withered flowers... The swirling flames drive me mad. A dark moon engulfs me.  I can't sense anything as it tears my body to shreds and takes me away, deep into the waves. Shards of glass, sinking into your cold stare. Far away, I hear it: a sign of daybreak. Then, in the darkness I see the ruins. The place deep in your heart where tears are born is where the answer sleeps:To keep its eternal beauty, the tragedy happens night after night.  ...At the end of the tunnel is a dazzling world.
