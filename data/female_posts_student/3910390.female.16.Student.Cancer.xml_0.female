I mean I was under the impression that we aren't supposed to lie to anyone, least of all our parents. Not only because the Bible says not to lie but it also says to respect and honor your elders, lying isn't exactly what I would call respect! Not to mention it won't get you anywhere because God knows that you aren't telling the truth and the reason your parents discipline you is so that you will be a strong person and you won't have to face God without at least knowing what is right and what is wrong. I've lied to my parents a few times in the past and I'll tell you I always feel horrible about it. But lately I had done a couple of things that I knew they didn't approve of but rather than trying to hide it or lie to them I just told them the truth. Yes they did get upset but they didn't really even punish me, they just said that they hope I'd learned my lesson and that they were proud of me and glad that I just told them the truth. Where as I remember when I would lie to them and they'd find out and it would be like WW 3 in the house. So take my advice because I have seen both sides, just tell the truth, you'll feel better and your parents will be more civil!!
