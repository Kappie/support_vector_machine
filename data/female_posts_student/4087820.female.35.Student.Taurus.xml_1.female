Every Friday we go out to eat (Think  Chic-fil-A , not  Cheesecake Factory ) and see the newest movie.  This Friday we saw M. Night Shyalaman's " The Village ". I had already notice that Ebert had given the movie only one star.  I usually respect his reviews. Still, I was fully prepared to be disappointed. I happen to like Joaquin Phoenix and I will see pretty much anything he is in.  Anyway, we went to  Chic-fil-A  and I ate one of those Cool Wraps (grilled chicken, cheese, and lettuce wrapped in a flour tortilla). They are huge and it made me sick. Maybe my body isn't used to anything green. I felt like I had eaten a brick and it was stuck at the top of my stomach.  Then, we drove across the freeway to the  Loew's  Movie Theatre. This movie theatre has to be 20- years- old and believe me, it could use a make-over. The seats hurt your butt big time. But, it's better than going to the  Cinemark  and waiting in line an hour. Every time we go, we know our butts are going to start hurting  before the coming attractions are  over.  One thing that bothered me last night was that the movie theatre was full of teenagers that laughed and talked through the movie. So, like the old thirtysomethings that we are, we mumbled under our breath and moved to the other side of the movie theatre where it was nice and quiet.  I enjoyed the movie. Not muched happened but it was beautifully shot, the actors were top-notch and it was interesting. Yeah, a few of the lines were ridiculous. I suppose if you were expecting a terror filled movie, you would have been disappointed. But I realized that Shyamalan's movies are never really like that.  Some of the kids were yelling "It sucked" but there was applause after the movie ended.  After the movie we drove to  Starbucks  and purchased two Venti-sized Vanilla Bean Frappuccino's. We are relatively new to the Starbucks craze. We aren't into coffee but damn if those Frappuccino's aren't heaven on earth!!!!
