A predictable jukebox, crooked pool tables, good times.  When I was seventeen, the summer right before I ran away from home, my parents went to Europe and left me unattended.  The best summer ever...I worked part part time at a pretzel stand in the mall and did theater productions.  My friends and I were midnight children.  Like all the rest are, I suppose, but it seemed special anyway.  We broke into apartment complex swimming pools and swam  in our underwear.  We jumped off of out buildings, bombing straight into the dark water.  We tackled each other and showed each other our bare asses.  The cops would come, and we would squeeze up to the edge and breathe softly while the flashlight beam swept over our heads and paused on our telltale soggy footprints.  We got caught sometimes, ushered out of the pool and lectured.  Half the fun of that age was the risk of being caught, the element of misbehavior.  Other nights we tripped acid and drove around the vacant streets, cruising just so far up the highway past the Donut Shoppe and the liquor store with the Vend-a-Bait out front, pretending we might go somewhere.  There were nights of spiced rum and games of Truth or Dare.  There were older men and there were bored hot days.  There was the pizza joint with its sad sagging slices and overloaded ashtrays.  There were nights we drove up to the high point of the town where MANHATTAN is spelled out in big concrete letters.  Used rubbers, cigarette butts, graffiti.  The sparse city lights- The cemetary, the lady in white with her cupped hands, the Fortune tomb- Pleasant Valley, Pilsbury Crossing- Hopkins Creek Road-  I have a really vivid memory.  Sometimes it just makes me feel old, letting all this stuff come to mind.  But enough of that.  A reminder to self:  Sometimes the horoscope is right.  It's fiction, but it's strangely worth heeding at times.  I need to stop being silly and chase these fancies away.  Oh, and my friend got me a ticket to The Pixies for my birthday!  Gigantic.
