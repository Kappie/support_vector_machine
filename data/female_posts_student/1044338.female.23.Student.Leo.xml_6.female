I bought myself a digital camera about four months ago and vowed to have a site put up with tons of interesting photos to envoke feelings of laughter, sadness, disgust, confusion or whatever emotion it may bring to you folks.  I have A TON of pictures waiting to be posted!! I'm dedicating this site as my- er--OUR, new hobby by geeking ourselves out for you folks. I know, I know, some of you are thinking, "What? Geeking yourself out? Don't you do that already?" I won't answer that one, I'll leave it up to the others to decide. ;o) I would end this post with a picture, however, I haven't exactly figured that part out yet, so for now, you'll just have to be satisfied with my emoticons.   :o/       :oP     :*(       :~D
