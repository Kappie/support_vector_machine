And then some little guy came along and pissed on the shattered remenants of that once glistening pyre to the flame of existence. And then there was a gas leak and the shattered remenants were instantaneously ignited.  I haven't read "Such Were The Joys...", so that's not what I meant, but I could see where such a thing could be gathered, in that semi-non sequiter comment 'o mine. That really would be weird, considering what a dumb and random thing that would be. Don't get me wrong, I'm on the top of that dumb and random heap. But there's just some grounds that just don't have a reason to, or need to be crossed, and that there is one of them.  It's true that you might have another person there, but they might not be consenting. And if you keep, you're just fucked up, or you're a rapist. Both. Yes, both.  Aah. The damage has been rendered. Any more contamination and the system will not survive. Sure, the IDs are screaming, " f KILL u EAT c MATE k REPEAT " but the sheltered kid superego is like, " Mother wouldn't like that, now would she? " And I can say that, too. I didn't know what "grinding" was until last year, you know. See this BLog for details!!!111oneone  I need to go dunk my head in a vat of cyanide.
