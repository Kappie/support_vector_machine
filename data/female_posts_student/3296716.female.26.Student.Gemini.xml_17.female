Anyway... he said that I need to stop changing my mind and settle on one research problem so that I can be done in May or August and graduate. So... the real-world problem that I am using is that there is a lot a of "turnover" in low income schools- that is, a lot of teachers put in for transferrs after being there for a few years. Why does this happen? What changes in the teachers when they become enculturated into this culture of the low income school? Why would they rather be at a different school?  Why is this anthropology? Because I think that the reason they leave the schools is because of the ways they learn to identify themselves during thier time as a teacher there. I think it's a problem of pre-teaching identity and post-teaching identity. Or perhaps they feel that this kind of position doesn't fit with thier current personal identity, and they can't find a way to reconcile their personal and professional identities....  He also gave me some advice about coursework, and I'm only going to take one class next semester, and the rest thesis hours. AND I am going to do a little research concerning a position as a teachers aid at a low income school....  In all, it was a really good meeting, and I hope I can keep this all narrow and straight to the point and get done in one more year :)
