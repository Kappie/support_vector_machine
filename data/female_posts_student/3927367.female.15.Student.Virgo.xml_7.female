Yesterday was fun. I mowed the lawn, cleaned the whole downstairs of my house, got my little brothers ready for swim lessons, and practiced the quads, all before lunch time. After lunch I had a quad sectional from 1 - 3:30. That went pretty well I guess. Our music is all paradiddles, paradiddlediddles, rolls, and messed up splits and stuff. Don't worry, I'm gonna have a whole different post that only concerns drumline, cuz there's a lot of crap going on there. Anyways, around 4 my boyfriend was supposed to come over so we could take my three youngest siblingsto a parkand get them away from my mom because she was totally freakin out from stress and whatnot. Well, evidently he called around 3 and my mom didn't tell me until about 4:15 that he was waiting for me to call him. That ticked me because 1) my mom always gets mad at us for forgetting to give her messages and yet when she does it to me she gets pissed because I get mad at her. double standard? I think so. oh yeah, and 2) because my boyfriend had said he would come over at four, I had it alreadyok'd with the parentals and everything. Then on the phone he had the gall to ask "so can I come over?" Well, that was a retarded question, but whatever. He came over, we took care of the kids, had dinner, went to McDonald's, and then came home and hung out with my family/watched Emperor's new groove. Fun fun fun. Actually it was fun. I'll post again later. certain people keep looking over my shoulder and it's ticking me off!
