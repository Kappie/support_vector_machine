Apart from a mini fiasco with the whole parking permit thing, everything was terrific.  Feeling the burn- oh yeah.  Now I've gotta shower and probably nap, too.  Tonight I think I'll go over to Christy's and watch season 2 of Law  Order, the original stuff with Chris Noth, Jerry Orbach, etc.  I gave it to her yesterday for her 18th. Tomorrow, Christy, Kaila, myself and Laura are all going to the Del Mar Fair.  Should kick some major apple pie and fried potato ass! Then, tomorrow night is the "Farenheit 9/11" party with Lauren, Steven, Steph, Debbie, and me @ the Hillcrest Landmark or La Jolla Village or something.  We'll have to bring signs or something. Hanging around, as you can see.  Gotta go feed the cat.
