(well okay, you could deny it but don't bother. :P)  anyways, the lyrics really struck me as i was watching it, so i thought i'd post em.   Breaking the Habit  Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safer in my room Unless I try to start again  I don't want to be the one Who battles always choose Cos inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  Cultured my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I have no options left again  I dont want to be the one Who battles always choose Cos inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  I'll paint it on the walls Cos I'm the one that falls I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  i think i mostly like the fact that the word "instigate" was used...just one of those random words i like for no apparent reason. like pandamoneium, only i have a reason for liking that, cos it reminds me of pandas. :)  seriously though, i do think i need to really get my ass in gear if i'm going to break all my crappy habits. noteably these would include . swearing (although i do find myself saying ffff...BOTHER more often now) . completely abusing god's grace by doing something i know is wrong, apologising then doing it again. and . getting bogged down in depressive thoughts when i should be focusing on jesus. this guy on a forum i post on said to me today "I was where you seem to be, but now - I am free. So can you be. And trust me, once free, you will praise the Lord our God and you will see the world as a different place. An entirely different place." i really want that freedom, and i think if i put enough effort into feeling happy i might be able to grasp it. i really want the world to change from this cold horrible place into a really bright sunny happy place, but i don't know if that's realistic. everyone keeps saying i have to face the fact that i might never recover from my depression, thing is i don't want to face feeling crap for the rest of my life and living in a miserable slimy reality. in fact, i refuse to face it!
