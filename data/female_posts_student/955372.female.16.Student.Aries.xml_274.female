Yeah so then we went back to her house and watched part of Bridget Jone's Diary. Yeah when i had to leave madeline keeps going "only ten more minutes left" only she said that like every five minutes. Good times. Oh right i have to remember this when we were walking up to paul's house i go "maybe we'll see him shoveling his driveway" and madeline goes "without his shirt on!" good times! yeah so then today i spent the entire morning watching "the wiggles" excellent show.
