But frankly speaking the results i get from this midyear... am i dreaming or what? It wasnt such a big fuss abt BCC. But i just feel that i didnt really studied... The effort i put in was little.. almost minimum.. yet i deserve doing better than pple?Yeah i studied but i had to admit.. i studied only subjects that i have interest in.. Then y i get those result? Jus pondering.. was God going to made me believe that when there's a will.. there's a way... Yeah i starting to believe in what u sow is what u get.. Hahaa...yeah.. got to start studying early.. 'cos i dun wanna let the teachers down.. I noe that mr osman had really put in effort in our geo.. For i remembered that time... the disappointment i saw in his face when i did badly for my test and sort of cheat with Eileen... Guess the looks will stayed in my heart... forever... Was this midyr really a test for my true ability? i dunno.. i jus noe.. i am afraid.. i wont do as well in midyr.. Every teacher seemed to change their views on me.. I am afraid.. deep down.. i let them down.. I am so afraid... i cant reach my goals.. But i remembered from the book "7effective ways of a teens".. It helped me when i thought i cant go on...i remembered the habits poem... Sometimes.. i will wonder..was that book a turning point of my life? i dunno.. But i noe something for sure.. it change my view, my personality and my life forever... Haha.. Life so strange isnt it?
