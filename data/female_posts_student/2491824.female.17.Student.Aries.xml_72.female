Ugh. I hate this.  I still haven't even started my tech project for Theatre2. It was due Friday, but we did not have school... G is going to be pissed. Hopefully, he won't drag it out and will leave it be after the class is over for the day--I mean, he won't drag it into my other theatre class or into rehearsals.  I'm in such a shitty mood. Everything sucks. ...And no one is on to talk to.
