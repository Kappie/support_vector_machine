When I first stepped outside the doors of mccomas, I immediately saw the soccer field.  Directly behind it was stood the mighty lane stadium.  As I rounded the corner, there was the wondrous cassell coliseum.  All were standing under a sky full of shining stars.  I was in heaven just thinking of all the sporting events that have taken place and all the times I was there to witness its glory.  If this isn’t hokie heaven, then I don’t know what is.
