Best fucking movie ever.  I know i got kicked off of bravejournal.com for 'questionable language'  but i had to use the explative to express exactly HOW MUCH i love this movie!!  ...fuckity fuck fuck.  The movie is awesome, and funny, and damn awesome.  did i mention awesome?  I would write all of the one liners and plot points that made me laugh, but that would include writing a SCRIPT of the movie.  Just so you know, i will be owning this movie, and when i do, t-shirts will be made of the news icons.  then he said               sixstring46 (9:47:03 PM): poker  Now, this reference could be made to pretty much any gathering since april.  but i'm pretty sure that he was talking about wednesday, when we went to see dodgeball.  Then, to avoid a storm, Mrs. P sprung for chick-fil-a and we went to alex's.   Now, i might sound like a stoner now, but when we were at alex's, we watched Wizard of OZ with the sound off while playing pink floyd's dark side of the moon.  Holy Crap.  So many things line up with the music!! it's crazy!!! if you ever have forty minutes or a couple doobies you should try it.  Anyway, after we did that, we put the chips on the velvet and let the cards fall where they may? (dammit! who put a question mark on the end of the sentence?  you KNOW he'll read anything thats put on that telepromter!!)                sixstring46 (9:47:12 PM): my brother masterbetting under the table  Ok, this was just gross!!  Ben, alex's brother, put his hands under the table and started moaning!  Automatically i said "Benwhattayadoing?"  He looked confused, and then said sassily "what, i'm not in labor."  just to be clear, no one thought he was in labor.               sixstring46 (9:47:26 PM): 4th of July was SKIPPED  Ok, here his comments ends.  But he does have a point.  On the fourth of july, some of us frisb'd at his house, then met up with moira and fam at ludwigs field.  The fireworks were fantastic and about 30 yards away.  There was this kid joseph... well, just go to bowyer's site (likeafellin.blogspot.com) to hear more about him.    Since this post is already heavily based on what other people have to say about me, i think i should end it that way.  Check out Jimmy's latest entry in btothethird and my response to it to fully appreciate.              PCappy22 (7:36:24 PM): i just read your comment on jimmys blog on btothethird......can i be                a goon?!   Anyone who wants to be a goon, please file out the standard form and hand it to my caporegimes to join one of their armies.  don't even try to deal with me directly, the best you'll get is my consigliere... unless it's my daughters wedding, or you're important.  Don't mess with the family... pezzanovante.    I have more things to talk about, but i'm kinda tired....
