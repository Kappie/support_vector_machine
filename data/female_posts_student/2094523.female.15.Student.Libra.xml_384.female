No one wants to get hurt.. but over and over again we put ourselves in a situation to get hurt. its as if we are aiming to get hurt. u know how u trick mice with a electrical shocker thing and u place it near cheese or somethign and they run into it and get electricuted a couple times before they realize that it shocks them? and we laugh right? but the thing is.. we're not better. we're humans.. but we're not smarter than mice by that much.
