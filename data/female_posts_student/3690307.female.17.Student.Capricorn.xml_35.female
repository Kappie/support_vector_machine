I thank the Good Lord that am going to (finally) make the right decision, and not because somebody told me that "Eric blah blah blah," or, "Oh MY GOD! John blah blah blah!"     It's not that I don't appreciate your (no doubt) genuine concern. Perhaps I am just upset with myself that I hurt the people I care about because I listened to the opinions of the ignorant and malicious.     No, I'm telling the truth. Why did I ever listen to everyone else on the planet (and their moms) when I should have been focusing on my own feelings, and the truth of the matter.     Bruised, mentally battered, I emerge a wiser person. So, to everyone who whispered in my ear and poisoned my judgement, Thank you.       (Note added, in response to posts. This is not about my friends, this is to all the people who never even talk to me before this, but now see it as their god-given right to slander the sound waves with their "valid" opinion.)
