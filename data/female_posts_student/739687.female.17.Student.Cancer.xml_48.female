I love it so much. I just keep listening to it. I think metaphorically, I can relate to it very well. I was listening to the radio last night before bed, and the second it came on I stopped everything n started listening and I was like "Oh my gosh...I love this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Haha...kinda crazy...  "...yeah life throws you curves...but you learned to swerve...me I swung and I missed and the next thing you know I'm reminiscing...dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes...like you would be back again...........I wake up and tear drops that fall down like rain...I put on that old song we danced to and then...I head off to my job, guess not much has changed...punch the clock, head for home, check the phone, just in case...go to bed, dream of you....that's what I'm doing these days..."  What a pretty song!
