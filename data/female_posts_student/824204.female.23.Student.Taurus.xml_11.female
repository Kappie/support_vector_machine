I kept repeating this over and over earlier as I stood by the water outside Treasure Island, and was thinking about so many things while listening to the gentle flap of water and feeling the humid breeze brush against my skin.        I posted a new picture on Friendster..... just thought I'd share.        I had such a blast this weekend!!! It was a weekend filled with dancing, hollering, hugging, kissing, meeting new people, music.... LOTS of music... alcohol...... LOTS of alcohol, heartbreak stories, tears, showers, "freaking," lap dancing, tube shots, singing in the car, singing in the house, food, friends, reminiscing, coughing, yosi jamming, yosi sharing, seeing old flames, seeing NEW flames, crushes, people watching, laughing........ LOTS of laughing!!!!!!! To sum it up.........I haven't had so much FUN in a long time!!!!!
