However I must say that I have met some amazing folks here this semester and I feel blessed.  As the summer progresses I can see my life blooming like the spring flowers outside.  Yet this season has terminated and I must make room for the new seasons flowers to bloom.  A hard step, but one that must occur inevitably.  Its now time for me to pack my bags and move house.  Its time to smile at the world around me, and pave the future.  An exciting yet nerve wracking step.
