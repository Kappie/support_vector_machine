It's in the shop-window of a porn-shop (You can see the last bit of "DVDS"). I believe the store dressing was taken down and replaced by a help-wanted sign after the Leafs loss to the Flyers, though.  urlLink          Some other amusing tidbits from the playoffs include: a pick-up truck that, after the Leafs' game 6 loss to the Flyers, spelled out "PHUCK PHILLY" on its windows; a mural depicting Alfie as a clown and a Stanley Cup, with the caption "WHAT DOES NOT BELONG"; in my high school, a piece of paper taped to the teachers' cafe (one of the teachers is a Flyers fan) that read some insulting slander each day (I took the liberty of turning it over and scrawling pro-Flyers messages); my own home-made GO SENS GO banner in my locker that must've attracted ten hate-intense stares a day; and finally, wearing my Sens jersey, walking down the halls and passing two guys in Leafs jerseys and laughing as we did so.      Hockey must start again.
