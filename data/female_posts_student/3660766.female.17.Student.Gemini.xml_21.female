Then they were both threatenin to kick each others asses. and i felt so helpless bc i could get derek off the phone and it was basically a fight over who has the biggest dick , or thats how it felt like. Now all these feelings are going thru my head again, about shit that happened and why it did and just stupid shit i should forget about. I thought i was gonna be ok and i was ready to move on, but obiviously not bc if i was i wouldnt be thinking about this shit n e more.
