French lessons, i don't know anything except"j'mappelle Isabelle" and "je suis Singapourienne" and yes!  "Comment tui t'appelle?" Now i am doing an online french quiz. Dismal scores: 1/8 then 4/8... new score..1/7 Wow!  My mum would freak out if she sees the way i'm doing french. "Elle est infirmière?"-that's the question and  m suppose to come up with a answer... Let me see.. What to write? "Oui, elle travaille à l'hôpital Cochin." Finally correct.
