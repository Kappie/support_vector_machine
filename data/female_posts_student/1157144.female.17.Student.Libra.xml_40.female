Oh, is there anyone out there because its getting harder and harder to breathe ::pant, pant, pant::  MU-HU BITCH!!!  Oh, I had Ryan going for a while.  I told him that I needed surgery on my eye where he hit it with that damn dark chocolate (I hate dark chocolate even more now.  In fact, i loathe it now) I told him I woke up and the blood had spread.  It was like I was looking through rose tinted glasses.  I told him I would have to wear a patch for the rest of my days.  Sigh.  Then he called me and I lead him on some more until I almost burst out laughing.  Then I told him it was all a lie.  He said he was relieved.  MU-HU BITCH!!! ANYWAYS,  she said something that I couldn't believe so I grabed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave.  Started talking shit and what do you know, I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the ho.  Don't you love Easy-E?  You know I do. Ah, I'm not gonna spend the night at the par-tay just so you all can decide not to since the life of the party won't be there.  Damn I'm acting like a concieted bitch tonight.  MU-HU BITCH!!!  See you all on the morrow.  ADIOS BITCH!!!
