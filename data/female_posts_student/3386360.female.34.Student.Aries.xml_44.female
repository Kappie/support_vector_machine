I've emailed A.C and though I realize it will be awhile before I am able to hear back from him. I do not know what to do. I'm sick. I thought of how the money was going to help me get things done, the money that was left I was going to save and give back to him. I'm scared. I am facing charges now because I trusted him. I'm confused and scared. On one hand I wonder is he lying to me ? Was it all a set up ? Or was he used too ? I wnt to believe he was used but with him not coming around, making excuses and then not coming back when he said he was going to it makes me wonder if maybe I was a victim of a sick game. I dont know what to think all I know is that I cant stop crying. I cant stop shaking and I cant seem to think right anymore.    I sent the kids over to the old place to get it finished being cleaned. Gods I hope they do it. I need to have that out of my hair. I cant deal with the stress anymore. My chest is hurting and I feel like I"m going to explode on the inside. I know it's my heart problems with all the stress but nothing I can do about it. I'm scared. Not only for the possible charges but my own health as well. I have to keep sane and I have to keep healthy for the kids. I'm losing it. I cant stop crying.    I am making an appointment for mental health. Ok M. I'm following your lead, your right I need to get some help until A.C. is back. So much is going on and so much needs to be worked on and I cant do it alone I realize that. I wish I had the courage to do more
