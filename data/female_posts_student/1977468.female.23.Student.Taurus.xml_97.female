I'll think of something I can do.    -  No. You have nothing. You have no one.    -  Eh...    ---------------  -   Oh geez was that two hours?    -  Might as well have been 5 hours, nobody misses you.    -  Mom and Dad are gone. I wonder where they went..    -  They didn't wake you up. They obviously don't care. You could think about this more clearly if you just relaxed. Yes, see? With your head on the pillow like that...   -   Yeah, it is easier to think this way.    --------------- -   Ohhhhh. is it 12:30?    -  Your such a lazy dick.     -  I can't believe I slept in again!!    -  Your weak. This is so typical. Have fun trying to fall asleep tonight.
