Man listenin to that cd brings back so many memories.lol Then krissy and i went over to dereks house and stayed there till 2 am lol we just got all of our feelings out about things and i found out  that i made the Hot list on the linebackers questionare thingy. Yah if u didnt know derek is a nosetackle for Roncalli, and he said that before every game the guys would name who they wanna fuck and shit, and me and krissy got all the juicy shit lol Then we all started talking about like who we liked and what we look for in a rship. It was like i got to see a differnt side to him , and i liked it. :)
