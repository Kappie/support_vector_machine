Bach is recorded, but the mike can't pick up dynamic differneces, so I probably sound like an idiot. All the dynamic patterns gone. And I have to work up Ravel again so at least it's clean...that'll be quite a task. All this for what? I really wish I could play C's Chopin like she played it Sunday--no, Saturday. Clean, fluid, artful. Should I be practicing Bach now? I can play it, but mental demons will invade my solidity and just screw me up. Artful. Very.  It just bothers me: I don't care about the hoja rosada in Spanish, I really don't care about the math test, and I probably just have to do vocab review in English. All I want is a clean Ravel and a clean Bach for a competition where just the sight of the application annoys me.  So we question: what is important to us? The most comfortable form of work for me right now would be to sit down with a pile of notecards and just study for the AP's...or write. Not piano, not homework.  mm, and I'm back. Homework is less than appealing. Funny priorities I have. I might as well grab the hoja rosada and just start working.
