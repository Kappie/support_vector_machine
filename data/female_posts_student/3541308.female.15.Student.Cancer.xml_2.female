It's a simple story of a first love and a first loss. The story line is age old, but you can't help but be affected by it. It has all the components of a masterpiece: talented cast, a well- done script, beautiful cinematography all combined with chemistry, romance, laughter, tears, jealousy, conflict, envy, love, and tragedy.  CAST:    Matthew Trant –father of Dani and Maureen         Abigail Trant –mother of Dani and Maureen         Marie Foster –mother of Court          Dani Trant –bestfriend of Court and younger sister of Maureen            Court Foster –son of Marie Foster and bestfriend of Dani         Maureen Trant –older sister of Dani  BODY:  I.	FIRST LOVE  	The story takes place on a farm outside a small country town. Two teenage girls are being raised by parents who are strict, but who are also loving and good. One of the girls, Dani, is 14 years old and has just passed uncertainly into young womanhood. Her sister, Maureen, is about 17. On hot summer nights they sleep on the screened-in porch and have girl talks, and Dani laments that she will never be as beautiful and popular as her sister. A widow moves onto the farm next door with her son, Court, who is about 17. One day he met Dani down at the swimming pond. They fight at first, but then they make up and become friends. Dani of course develops a huge crush on this boy, and for a day or two days, it seems they feel the same emotions to each other. Dani asks Maureen how to kiss, and Maureen gives her lessons. She "practices" on her hand. Then Court kisses her, and she confesses it was the first time she has ever been kissed by a boy.         II.	    HEARTBREAK 	The moment is so perfect then, Court and Dani are just having sort of friendly talk. But eventually the older sister of Dani, Maureen, had arrived home. Then Court saw Maureen and unintentionally he was attracted to this lady. And as the days go by, Court forgets the girl with whom he started the perfect kiss. There are days and weeks that Maureen and Court spend more time together. Here with Dani, who is in pain and sorrow because of jealousy, heartbreak, and hopelessness. There are times that Dani wants to be with Court but he doesn’t want, he likes to be with Maureen all the time. Then the lovers had this nasty date, and this cause of Maureen’s pregnancy. It was Dani who first receive the heartbreaking news from her sister. And to add more pain, it was Court who did it. This poor girl feels that the whole world crashed on her and its like her life stopped. Their parents didn’t know it somehow.  III.	TRAGEDY IN LOVE  This sunny day, Court is working with his mother, who is Marie Foster, in a farm of their own, and then her mother left him for a while to get some food to eat. This boy next door, who is Court, is so happy that she had Maureen. And had a relationship with her. Dani is about to go to that farm to talk about what happened between him and her sister last few weeks. Court is about to get his hat from a tree at the same time driving a tractor. Accidentally, Court fell from the tractor and sliced to death from the sharp blades. Then her mother arrived from their house, and she saw his son lying on the ground, helpless, and covered with blood. Mrs. Foster is crying out loud for help. Then, Dani run fast where she had heard some shouting for help, there she saw Court’s mother crying and holding Court’s lifeless body. Then, Dani was so afraid to what she had seen and she run more faster, calling for help. She runs faster as if she didn’t know where to go. As she arrived to their house she calls for her father to help Court in his serious condition and her father rushed to help him. They had arrived in the hospital but Court died on the spot. When Dani knew that Court is already dead, she started to cry and mourn. Suddenly, Maureen also knew it. It is more painful for Maureen because she is carrying Court’s baby. The parents knew that she is pregnant and they felt terribly sorry for her. There are nights that Dani and Maureen didn’t talk because of the tragedy and the conflict between the three of them. But Mrs. Trant talked to her younger daughter about the problem. She explained and gave advices to Dani. Then the following day, Dani is about to talk to Maureen but Maureen is not home. She found her in the cemetery and there she saw her sister mourning in front of Court’s tomb. Then she realized that she is not the only one who is in sorrow but additional sorrow for her sister because she will always Court because she has his baby. The both of them became friends again and start life all over again. It was night time and it was full moon then. They agreed to theirselves that Court will still remain in their hearts and they will remember him when they look upon the moon. Its like until there is the moon in the dark night sky, Court is still with them.            CONCLUSION: 	 I therefore conclude that the plotline is very simple and in many ways predictable. But the real art is how the story is told from beginning to end. You end up caring about all the characters and how your sympathy moves from one to another.  EVALUATION: 	 I will never tire of reading it because this isn't just a story about teenage romance, it's a story about idealism, about how we idealize what and who we love, and a story about the meaning of life. Yes, the Meaning of Life, which is a topic of teenagers discuss a good deal as their insides churn with hope and doubt, and which adults discuss less and less, the more they could benefit from it.
