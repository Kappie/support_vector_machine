She was one of my first friends from ND.       She was my first new friend that invited me over and had me spend the night.. Allie, Sarah, Caro, and I went and saw "Uptown Girls"(btw, I still have the ticket stub, sounds dorky, butI put it in my scrapbook next to a pic of the four ofus at our first high school dance)..Allie and I got ready and hadspaghetti at her house before Activity Week Dance.. and the four of us all had our pictures taken together at Activity Week Dance and at Christmas Dance. So yes, I do have some good memories of our friendship. And I'll never forget Friday night.. fauk! Hehe.       Thank you, Caro, for the memories. We'll never forget you. *hugs*
