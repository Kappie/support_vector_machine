I was in a  urlLink Stew Leonard's-esque  grocery store when Arnold Schwarzennager walks in and this guy I know,  urlLink Rich , walks up to him and starts kissing his ass so hard, I was like embarassed to be there.  Anyhow, Arnold walks out and we all stand around talking about it.  Then he walks back in in his Terminator leather jacket and opens fire on everyone with a street sweeper.    I grab my friend Ashley's hand and we start running and climbing through offices and out of windows scaling down all of these terraces and balconies.  We get on the ground and start running but we're too slow to out run him, so I show her how to fly (drugs are bad, mmm kay?) and we are like running and flying and jumping off all these cliffs.  We get to somewhere we think is safe to hide and there are all these evil cult girls (like Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker) who want to cut our thumbs and take our blood so they can make us evil and we wont be able to be killed by Arnold.    I don't like this 'cause we'd still be evil, but they start talking to Ashley about how she looks like a soccer player and she starts to fall for the trap and I save her and we jump off a cliff and then I woke up.  I kinda wanna know how it ends though.  I think ultimately I am  less  upset that I was trying to be killed by Arnold, and more upset that I was dreaming of Rich.
