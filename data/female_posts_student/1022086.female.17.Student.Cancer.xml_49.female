Yes- an original Iranian carpet... yes, I have to clean it... grr... but let me get to the point:  c) MUSIC MIDTOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!  This one's "oh-my-gawd"-worthy!  The selections this year are awesome. I want to go. Pretty badly.  Offspring, Foo Fighters, Switchfoot, and Damien Rice are the main reasons. Other good bands, too: Smile Empty Soul, Trapt, Story of the Year, Puddle of Mud ( though I don't care too incredibly much for them), Fuel (same as previous), Default, and this band that I don't know whose name I like, George Clinton  Parliament Funkadelic. *Is about to download stuff and find out who it is*  But yeah, here's the whole lineup:  http://www.musicmidtown.com/schedule/index.cfm   W00t!!!   "You" by Switchfoot   There's always something in the way There's always something getting through But it's not me It's You  It's You  Sometimes ignorance rings true But hope is not in what i know It's not in me..me It's in You, it's in You  It's all i know It's all i know It's all i know  I find peace when I'm confused I find hope when I'm let down Not in me ... me In You It's in You  I hope to lose myself for good I hope to find it in the end Not in me ... me In You  It's all i know It's all i know It's all i know  In You In You It's in You It's in You  There's always something in the way There's always something getting through But it's not me It's You It's You It's You ....   I wish I could still totally relate to the lyrics...
