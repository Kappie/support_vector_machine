I got up at 12:45((a collective groan from the working readers as they long for highschool summers once again)) to find mom and Devon flitting around getting ready to leave. Mom is going for a spa bit/lunch/errands, and Devon is going to an art class, yes, an art class. Now I am a weensy bit pissed that my shitmunch sister had managed to find some summer entertainment and I was still waiting for some news on my html class, which will most likely never ever happen.   back to the story---I was home alone for a while and I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth and I was looking at myself in the mirror when I heard footsteps on the carpet. I immediately flipped out and slammed and locked the bathroom door. I stayed in the bathroom for about a half hour, yelling things like "take whatever you want and slam the door on your way out so I know you're gone" and "please go away". Then the phone rang, and I was brave enough to run into the living room and get it. It was mom, and she told me to meet her in the driveway to get some steak she had gotten from the butcher so she could continue her errands. Well I was in my underwear((yeah, I walk around nekkid when nobody's home)), but I wouldn't go in my bedroom where the robber was, so I grabbed a blanket that was folded over the back of the couch and ran out the door, explicitly flashing the neighborhood as I wrapped the blanket around me. After about a minute of hopping around in the driveway my mom pulled up, looking puzzled. "what are you doing?!" "there's a robber in the house and you have to go kill him". So mom grabbed a big umbrella from her trunk and proceeded to go into the house and bang things with the umbrella whilst yelling "hellooo?". When she was satisfied that the house was robber-free, she took me to my grandmother's friend's house, where my grandmother was fixing the friend's computer. After laughing uncontrollably for several minutes, she told me that the folks from the city had come to check the electric meters and what I heard was their footsteps on the side of the house in mushy wet grass, NOT their footsteps on my carpet in my room.   ha. ha ha ha. ha. ha.  Well once that ordeal was over with and all was well, Johnathan called me!!! We talked for a good while about stuff, and I inadvertently said the word "cute" ((I suppose you could call it a nervous habit?)) about sixty more times than I meant to, causing him to ask "is 'cute' your favorite word?". My looove.
