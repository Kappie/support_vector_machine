(dane- then type something before i get a chance to jump in silly goose :-P). alright...anyway...hows everyones summer been?? (dane- good. you?) OK...dane...stop...your driving me crazy.(dane- i love you too). so...random thoughts...ok...shut up dane. ok...why is the plural of mouse mice when the plural of house is houses????? (dane- i dunno) shut up no one asked you. (dane- yeah you did....) anyways...you wanna hear something funny...(dane- ohoh can i tell?!?!)no... anways we were here at school (dont ask...) and we decided that it would be funny to call my boyfriend. well...we did and dane left a message (dane- the message said that i was holding briana for ransome and that i wouldnt give her back unless i got 200,000 dollars... we then called back to say that he needed to call her and then he picked up and he tried to sell her to me for 1$ then 50 cents then 55 cents and i was gonna buy her into slavery but then i thought about all the hungry children in ethiopia and said nah you can keep her shes all yours.... ok im done... have a nice day... when do i get to interupt again.... never. poo. can i have a hug... please... anyone... yes im talking to you.... briana turn around and give me a hug please.... please.... no hug... :'( i see how it is.... *cries*.... ok heres briana again.... crap no hug....) ok...im finally back...gosh dane. (dane- what no hug) thats right no hug...anyway...anyone reading this would be like...what were they smoking when they wrote this...but i swear...we are not high...or drunk...or anything else...this is us. and sorry for writing so much...but seriously...who else is going to write in the blog in the summer...come on...we gotta keep you guys reading... (dane- considering i am reading the first book on my own will in about 2 years.... crap lost my thought....) hahaha...thats nice dane...anyway...im going to try to mkae this the longest blog entry ever on here...so...any thoughts dane?? (dane- yeah where is my hug... im sitting right behind you and all you have to do is reach out your arms and ill reach out mine... sounds like a movie... and then we can embrace each other for the brief moment of randomness and huggyness.... is that a word?..... hug? *coughpleasecough*)...first...no...huggyness is not a word...and neither is randomness. ok...i think we should call skeet again. that was funny. anyway...so...LaLaLaLaLa...(dane- dot dot dot dot dot doo doo.. dot dot dot dot doo doo doo if i only had a brain.... does anyone know the first half of the words.... *looks at briana* thats a no... um um um. end randomness... and i dont care if it isnt a word.....). ok...first...doesnt everyone wish you had a brain...second...no i dont know the words to the first half of the song. ok...CHEESE NIPS...Get over here Dane...(dane- what i was getting some cheese nips. no you can not have the key board... im still chewing.... never mind...) anyway...has anyone really done anything productive over the summer?? Or has everyone been like me and sat on the couch all day..sometimes going to the beach...which reminds me...we should have another barbeque... (dane- does mowing lawns count?) sure...i guess...(dane- ha and i get paid..... I GOT A 12 STRING BASS!!!!! ITS SEXY!!!!!!. ok end randomness.) Sexier than me?? LOL (dane- i think we both know the answer to that dont you?) Yeah...the bass is sexier. (dane- well your wrong... i still think your sexier... you at least talk to me.... i mean i can jsut screw around with the bass and it doesnt say anything.... it just sits there... i mean you complane if something is wrong... i have to figure out whats broken in the bass cause it wont tell me..... besides..... never mind.. dirty thought... all and all... your sexier!) Yeah...well at least you wouldnt sell me for 55 cents. (dane- *thinks*...... nah... maybe for 3 clones i would... but .... nah not even 3 clones could replace you :-) ) AWWW...WOW...how random is this entry...(dane- very)..do you think that anyone is even reading this?? (dane- i am... well i will when i get home... so 50% of the people other than you that read this will have seen this massive entry of us having a non-verbal conversation...) yeah...(dane- yellow!) and...at least i know that whenever i get sad, i can just look at this and laugh...ok...yep... (dane- CHICKEN WINGS!!!!!)...Ok...that reminds me of a funny story. we made a funny movie called space chicken. and we made the sequel...Space Chicken 2: Space Chicken returns. we have yet to film it, but i think that it will be a smash hit. doesnt it sound like something you guys will watch?? (dane- ok what does that have to do with the price of eggs in china on a thursday morning at 7:00 am at the farmers market in Beijing on 32nd street next to the gong...??? any way i have to go now so ill see you guys later... here is briana for the rest of the page... later guys.) gosh...thank goodness hes gone...LOL...OK...anyways...nows my chance to talk about Dane behind his back...hahaha...just kidding. WoW...this is really long...for anyone who actually took the time to read this...well...im sorry you wasted your time...and i swear, im not like this all the time...dane is...but im really not...ok...i usually am...WHOHOO...i just got coffee...im not sure if it was such a good idea to give me coffee...but...who am i to refuse an offer, right?? anyway...im sure that you guys reading this would like to return to your pathetic lives...jk...so i am going to go now...i would to end this very long semi-conversation by saying that i hope that everyone has a good summer...and this coffee is really hot. ok guys...i'll see you later. love, briana w/additional commentary by dane.
