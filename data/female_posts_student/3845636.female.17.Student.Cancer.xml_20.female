We can make all the effort to keep our relationships going, but without this intangible 'fate' , everything may not turn out well as expected. Of course there are many others who do not believe in fate. They believe that it's they who control their lives and not fate. true... I agree to what they say. However, there are times whereby certain things are not within man's control, isn't it? Thus I think we should always treasure every moment we spent with one another. It's something amazing that had brought all of us... the different ppl with different personalities and upbringings together. It's not something done deliberately... it's just so ironic and at times we can't explain why this had happen either.  I was flipping through my autograph book... the one I had before leaving pri.sch, when I was preparing to head for a whole new chapter of sec.life back then. Here... was what one of my teachers(CKPS) wrote " Life is not a bed of roses but it is sprinkled with many learning experiences. Every step we take make us ever wiser! " . Till now 5 years down the road... I can still vivdly remember the msg he left me. I believe that it had left an impact in my life... and it's an advice that will continue to guide me through thick and thin. I think sometimes we should never take things too lightly... I can't guarantee that all good things will last forever. However... we should always enjoy what we have... a step at a time. It's not a matter of being optimistic or not. It's a matter that one day... you would leave this place with little regrets. Knowing that you have once hold these memories and had shared it with the dear ones around you. By having faith in yourself and the friends you have... only then things will work out. Without basic trust in the first place... I don't see a point to start a relationship. Efforts will just go down the drain... knowing that you may have lost time meeting another wonderful person out there.  We lost a PE teacher (SACSS) lately... and I believe that he will definitely continue to live in the hearts of each and every student he had once taught. He's someone who believes alot in tough love and we were probably still less mature back then in sec.sch, to realise his real intention of disciplining us. He always believes that a school needs a "Father" to keep everything going and he has bravely taken up this role of a "bad guy..." Often... I wonder why must we wait till the person leave us one day... then we realise how important they are to us. I guess that's human's nature, to take things for granted. Although all of us avoid doing so... but sometimes it's hard, because we are influenced by the things around us...  I think reflections will help to guide us along the right track...and I believe that although time flies quickly... if we truly treasure it... then we won't miss out the ppl around us.
