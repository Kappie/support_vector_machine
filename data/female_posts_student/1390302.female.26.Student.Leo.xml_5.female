When I was only 5 years old my family moved to Hesperia, California.  I remember being terrified to live in the desert, my uncle had told me that if I stepped foot outside of the car the snakes would eat me alive.  It was a mean thing to say to a child, and it stuck with me when moving day came.  Fear stricken, I reluctantly climbed outside of the car and to my pleasant surprise I wasn’t eaten alive after all.  Maybe the desert wouldn’t be so bad, after all.  Shortly after moving to the Mojave Desert I began to have a dream.  Darkness filled the sky in a strangely solid pitch black.  High rocks climbed toward the sky in hues of gray and brown and below where there would be a river, there was bubbling hot lava that stood red and contrasting to the blackness of the sky.  A black, clean highway ran through the rocks, with a long guardrail to protect the passing vehicles, except there were no passing cars.  There was nothing in sight, not people, animals, no cars, only the rocks climbing up and up, and myself.  Absently I climb to the top of the tall rocks and momentarily look over at the hot, bubbling liquid below, and then I jump.  I jump as if against my will, realizing my death only moments before plunging into the red heat.  Pain burns me to my bones as I sink wholly into the lava in one last screaming breath.  Then, to my ultimate surprise I float to the top, swim to the edge, climb back up the back of the rocks and jump, again.  The dreams continues, the same thing happening again and again.  Then I wake up, only the dreams memory to remind me.  I still have this dream 3 or 4 times a week, even now, even thought I don’t live in the Desert anymore.  For the last 21 years I have been trying to figure out why.  When I was little, my mother used to take us over that pass through the rocks and into the valley beyond.  I remember that I was always frightened of the overpass –as I am scared of heights.  I believe, thinking back now, that the area had such a profound effect of fear on me that my mind exaggerated it and stored it into my subconscious.    The dream no longer scares me, it has just become a part of sleeping for me now.  Though it has come less frequently since I have moved to Texas, I still have it.  It’s as if the dream won’t let me forget my fear.
