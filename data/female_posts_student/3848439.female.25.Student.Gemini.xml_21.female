Besides being a blinded bastion of liberalness (anyone know a "b" word meaning liberal?) the folks at NYT have this amazing ability to endow anything they want - and honey, do I mean  anything  with enough praise  10-cent vocabulary to make it seem like a true wonder to behold.  Case in point: Check out this  urlLink movie review  (You may have to register, but go ahead.  It's free!)  ...and it's two pages long.  Really! Heh!
