I think it was early to get yearbooks. If I remember right, last year we didn't get them until the last week of school. I thought that was a standard time to get yearbooks.  My picture is actually kind of alright. I think it is at least and I never like any pictures I take at all. I need to ask somebody. I don't know anybody to ask. But I think it really reflects me...like I only have this small sweet shy smile (aliteration unintentional). I look a little nervous like I'm scared something will happen to make things fall downhill or make me sad or upset. My camp councelor said I'm always "waiting for the other shoe to fall" and that's so accurate.  But anyway, my picture shows that I think. I don't like my hair in it but I never like my hair ever so that's no big deal. My AFI shirt is striking. Ha.  It's an alright picture I guess. I've got nothing to work with though so a picture of me can only be but so alright.    I've got nothing to do. I wish Sarah was awake. Or anybody, really. Nobody is around. My dad is outside working and I asked if he'd go bowling with me (not expecting anything - half kidding) and he said he would like to - he was thinking about it earlier - but he has a lot of work to do before it rains. I said I'd help him so he could get it done quicker but he said I couldn't help. He has to mow really tall grass and you have to do it this special way or something and he knows what he's doing and I don't so he'll do it. I don't blame him for not letting me. I always do things myself because I don't trust anybody else to do it right.  But I am sad that he would go bowling if he could. I don't know if Sarah's awake or not. Somebody ate eggs and it wasn't me and it wasn't my dad...it couldn't have been my mom...and my aunt's visiting and I don't think it was her...so it had to have been Sarah... But I didn't hear anything from her room so she could have gone back to bed. Yesterday she said she wanted to go bowling I wonder if she would today. I have some money, even though I was saving it for a band tee.   At least this is giving me something to do. As long as I keep typing I'm not bored. I even worked on my stupid site. I even played a little guitar. I even typed some. I've done everything. I did my homework early, that's the big one. I don't even believe that.  But I don't want the day to end or anything because I like weekends. But then I don't. And we only have four more weeks of school anyway, so soon I'll be doing this everyday anyway. And I know exactly how summer break is going to be. That problem I have...if you are reading this and are curious...just read some previous posts...I'm having trouble enough dealing with it now...with school to keep me busy, let alone during the summer when I have nothing to do but that. That's why I want a summer job. I applied for one but I don't think I'll get it. I know I won't.   I don't have friends. Nobody to do anything with. My sister doesn't like me and is mean. I don't do anything on the computer except use it to play music and play solitaire. I can only read but so long, depending on the book. Horray for summer.
