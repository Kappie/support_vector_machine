Other than that, CYT was canceled today so I have absolutely nohting today, I think I might make more snikerdoodles!   Gosh, our speaker are GREAT!  They sound gorrrgeous!  On a side note,  School will probably be canceled AGAIN tomorrow!!  SAVE ME!  I really really want to go to nordstrom.   Well, I am off to put this junk that my brother got from the dermatologist so remove my zits that are popping up EVERYWHERE on my face.
