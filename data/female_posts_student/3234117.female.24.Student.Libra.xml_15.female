So being the nice girl I am, I told him I'd get the door for him, but some other guy was going out as we were going in so I didn't have to.  Anyway as we were waiting for the elevator we talked and he asked me if I was a student.  Now this question wasn't out of the ballpark as I was carrying my backpack.  I said yes, but what I should've said is I'm a GRADUATE student, like it would make a difference! Anyway so here I am thinking wow, what a hot guy and he's talking to me. If only his name was Dr. Andrew Christensen.  But then like a blow to the face, I see it as he gets in the elevator, the little gold ring on his left hand.
