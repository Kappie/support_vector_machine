I want to have the girls dancing on the bad, the fire get lit on the bar counter, play the Devil Went Down To Georgia and some I wanna be a Cowwwwboy music and just it just be a crazy as hell bar!  Then...I want a very cozy small coffee/juice bar hosue and have open gig night and people come and put their artwork on display and poetry and it be always a lot of regulars. I'd like it to be like a nice place for people to just go and sort out their thoughts. I picture like big red comfy sofas, little wooden tables and lamps and it be set up like it's a nice town in Italy, like the walls be brick and just have the scenery of Italy, street lamps, flowers, alley look, etc. It will just be a very art influenced enviroment.   So yeah, a nice relazing cozy enviroment, art infuenced, and then a crazy as hell, fun, wild enviroment, infuenced by part'ay animals! haha
