This little climbing bouldering paradise is located just 30 minutes away car from Hood River, located across the Columbia gorge in Washington. Fun and be prepared for snakes! No sport climbing but just bouldering. Bouldering's tough as this is not my strong area. Bouldering's just hard in general, it is all about having and learing the right technique. When a bouldering problem's being presented to you, just gotta keep working on it till you get it. I was simply kicking myself in the butt partly I didn't have enough upper body strength and that certain mental toughness. Bouldering's a good way to get your technique and especially my head straighten out. Just gotta trust your feet, really push it all out, and toughen it out. Bouldering's also the best way to sharpen your climbing skills before venturing into further sport climbing. When climbing, gotta have that grace and light weight feeling towards your movement, otherwise you would just look like a heavy elephant trying to do the impossible.
