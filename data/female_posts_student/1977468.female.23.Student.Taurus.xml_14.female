All I know is that Jen's uncertain now about going, which basically means she's not looking forward to going with me even if she does say yes again. I still don't understand the signifigance of it all... why it seems to weigh so heavily. Whatever the case, it's gunna be awesome, because I decided that. I was talking to Tanny about prom, and she offered that if worse comes to worse she'd take pity on my situation and escort me. If that sounds pathetic, its not.   The only thing that would suck about going stag  (im so used to it) would be riding alone in the Jag. I imagine if that happened I could put Tokyo in the front seat and fasten the seatbelt. Tokyo is the name of my beautiful guitar. I just wrote her a love song. It's called "Me and the Tokyo". When my band gets it's website up I'll host the song there, cause I've been recording it.  I think for the first time in a while my emotional scene is getting back in check. For about a year and a half I was so knotted up inside I lost my attraction to women altogether. Last week though, I saw a girl, and I thought she was really hot. Thats a big step for me. It's one thing to know when someones hot, but to FEEL the hottness is another thing altogether. I felt the hottness.  I saw part of the "gang" at Clark today. We rapped. That means talk, not like actaully rapping. That would be dumb.  Sleep time, bye byes.
