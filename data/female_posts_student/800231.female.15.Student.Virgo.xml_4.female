My block classes are all getting split up and I'll miss some people. Oh well, its not like I don't see them outside of class. I have photography this semester, that'll be fun at least. I've also been signed up for a tech class. I was going to test out so I could do something more interesting with my time but Steph has the same class and I'd like to spend more time with her. So I guess I'll stay. I went up to the tech room today with Helen and Lucia because they were both going to test out. Anyway I met the teacher Mr. F. What an odd guy, I'm not really sure what his issue is yet, suppose I'll find out on Monday though. He showed a pretty large interest in Lucia though. Helen was talking to him and he just got completely distracted by Lucia and started asking her a bunch of random personal questions. This went on for several minutes before he got distracted once again by Helen and me. I was looking for a dollar in my bookbag and Helen called me a 'homeless person' for some unknown reason. Finally, someone harasses Lucia instead of me. I swear, I'm not very pretty but for some reason I'm creepy-ass teacher bait. I hate that, my 8th grade counselor used to grab my butt every chance he got. Thinking back there's at least four of them that sexually harassed me. What is wrong with me?!  I got a ride with my mum after school because I was to lazy to wait for the bus, cell phones are useful things. I get in the car and she says, "I cleaned out your closet today." I thought that was alright until I got home and found out that her definition of "cleaning" was taking everything out of my closet and throwing it on the floor. Good lord, I took me an hour to sort though everything and get it back in my closet. Why do I get the feeling she doesn't like me?
