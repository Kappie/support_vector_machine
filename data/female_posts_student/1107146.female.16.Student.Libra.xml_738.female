Damn, I love pictures! Dammit! I'm really serious.  I finished assembling Abby's present, Linds. To quote, "Boy howdy, is it neato!" I've actually been staying up til three in the morning with a purpose?!? My god!   Woo! Have fun, kids! And a Merry Christmas if I don't get back on, and considering that I think I'm getting some trick ass stuff, I'm thinking not.  Heh. G'bye for now, friends.
