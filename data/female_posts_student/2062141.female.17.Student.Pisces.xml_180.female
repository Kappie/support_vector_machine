I'm not sure what to say, I just wanted to write something down.. mainly because there's no one to talk to online and I've already checked any sites I usually look at... and this is the next stop.... hm. Well, had a good day, half-day, woo! Let's see... had private school kids stare at my posse, movie was great, me and Erinn beat Charlotte and Nick at Taboo (barely), oo and I had one of those new cheesy gordita crunches from Taco Bell. Yah that was exciting. I was all like CHEESY... CRUNCHY... MELTY! And we started watching The Godfather but only got like 15 minutes in before we had to go... and now I really wanna keep watching it but everybody'd get mad, plus I want them to see it. I'm babbling. I'm sorry. I just feel like... sharing!  Josh is acting like nothing happened, which I guess is what I am doing, because I hate strife and I don't want to prolong what I have decided to proclaim the DUMBEST FIGHT EVER, but to tell you the truth what you did hurt because it was out of spite, whereas what we did was a misunderstanding. And the fact that you talked about us to EVERYBODY that you were 'so mad', and, if I know you, probably painted us out to be bitches, even though if you told them the actual story they would probably go away thinking you were being ridiculous.... I don't know if I can be okay with you right now. You know you'll always be my buddy, but just this week, uh maybe not... cause you sure weren't treating us like a friend. I would have this horrible sinking feeling in my stomach every time you would pass me in the halls after I say hi, with that snotty expression on your face, ignoring me. How can you treat one of your closest friends (or at least I thought), someone who is always there for you,  that way after they just didn't think to invite you to some dumb movie??? How is that justified? Uhhh... I just don't think we deserved how you treated us so um yeah. There. It's hard for me to say things like that to people but goddammit I'm posting it! Meh he doesnt' read this site anyways so this way I'm just getting it off my chest. There I feel better! Yeah.
