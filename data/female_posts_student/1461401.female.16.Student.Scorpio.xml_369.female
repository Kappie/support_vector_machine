For a little more than a week though, I've been having really vivid dreams, a few of them have stuck with me even till now. The strangest part is, in certain dreams I actually  feel . A kiss in one dream leaves my lips tingling, a hug in another leaves me feeling warm and whole. I have felt the smooth of a cloth, and the weighlessness of bouncing in a moon room, and tasted the sweet tang of lemonade. Mom says it's because this summer has been so boring for me that my mind is making up for it in my dreams, but I wish they wouldn't. One of the worst feelings in the world is for everything in your life to go right, only to wake up into reality. For the one thing you want the most to come back to you, only to wake up lost again. After one dream, even after I woke up, I felt whole. I felt warmth. I reveled in the feeling while I wrapped myself in my comforter. It was the best I had felt all summer. But it faded. The feeling faded, but not the dream. I don't know.  Sweet dreams.
