(no offense to anyone except for the dumb guy that ran into the back of the spirit) is it that hard to keep your foot on the brake while at a red light, i think not but this guy proved me wrong. luckily the spirit is built like a battleship and the car left no mark, but still, i was just a tad shooken up, but the guy looked like he was about to cry, interesting day.
