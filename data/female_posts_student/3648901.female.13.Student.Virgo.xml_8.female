Well I just got 2 my grammaz, and quite obviously Im on her PC. I just got The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Marilyn Manson's autobiography. What can I say? Its so kickass. I highly recommend it *thumbs up*. Not much else has been going on. I swear to God tho its fucking rained every day in Thunder Bay for at least 2 weeks. It sucks, man. I had a good chat with Amanda on the phone, havent talked 2 her in a long time. So that was fun. Gunna watch the fireworks tonight from my grammas balcony :) Her living on the top floor of an apartment rules, except Im deathly afraid of heights. Oh well fuck it :P So thats about it. Peace, people!  "Somebody get this freakin' duck away from  me!"
