The people there were nice, friendly and outgoing. Some of them just seem scary. But almost all of them were really, really  maasikaso.  I really loved my foster family coz they were really nice and easy to get along with. I also met a new friend. Her name is Jonalyn. She's a little girl. And she's really, really cute!! She even kissed me on the cheek when she was about to go.  Aww how sweet!  I'll really gonna miss her!!!
