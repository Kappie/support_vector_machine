They and the lyrics express how I feel, what I'm going through. The weird thing is that I took those yesterday afternoon, way before we broke up. But I felt it...I felt this ominous feeling pass through my body and I bursted out crying. I started thinking about the dream I had about him. I got dumped and yelled at. Cold deals, it was. Another thing...I was messing around with my phone and Franks' info and stuff is in "secret" mode and I can't fucking open it. I don't know my user lock. I can't recall ever knowing my user lock. But it thought it was strange that it was his number. Maybe it implied that "You won't be needing his number, anyway." BOOO. Man, if I didn't see it coming, I probably wouldn't be dealing with this as well as I am now. For me, we parted when we had that break. It wasn't the same after that. But I tried. I fucking tried. I'm a lot stronger than I think...stronger than most people think. Then, I saw his pic on my wall and I said, "Goddamn." and I shook my head.  True story.  I can't stop crying. It's not really a bad thing. It helps me...releases the pain bit by bit. It's a mixture of sad and happy cries. Nostalgia has hit me hard again.  Oi, I need hobbies. :D Actually, the first thing I did after I talked to him was read my psychology books and all my foreign language dictionaries. My old loves have come back to me. But I can't possibly sit in my room and read those all day. :p I wish Tsedey was here. She's in California...she's finally gonna meet her love. I hope it all went well.  Suriyo is being such a bitch to me.  Madeleine made an account at communities! Now I have all my lesbos together on one site. Muahahaha.  GOSH! I'm so tired! I didn't sleep until 6 and I woke up at 10. First, I was trippin' about Franks and the heat was getting to me. I decided to write him a postcard. Felt better, got into bed... Woke up a minute later. I remembered that I ran out of frog food. The poor thing has been starving for 5 days! Then, I started getting mad about the user lock. I can't even add his number back into my phone 'cause it says that I already have an entry with his number in it. I had to put it in the memo pad. This is bull crap.  ANYWAY I got the greatest friends. People have been messaging me, asking me how I'm doing. I want to thank you all. And thank you Franks for being nice about all of this. I love you, comrade! (bah)
