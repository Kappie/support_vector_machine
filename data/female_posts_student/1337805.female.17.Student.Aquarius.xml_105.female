I've been sick, and it's tiring me out. Now my asthma is getting wonked, so I have to deal with inhalers. I also have to find the one I lost. I've been stressed out trying to make codes for html work. My ex came out and told me he still liked me. Mom said she doesn't want to pay for my Van trip, my Oregon trip, or a passport. One of the girls in my class has been clashing with my personality. My feelings for people have changed. I have new medication, Tri-cyclen if you must know. I'm finding myself attracted to new people, and having my heart crudely ripped open with the same excuse as before..."I told you.." Saw Lannie today. Gave me a ride home. Planned Disney days with Laura a bit more. Will post movie list soon.    It just hurts today. I wanted this weekend to be something good, to connect with someone, and find out what was chemistryly clicking between us, and all. But now... Maybe not. All I wanna do is rather up in a corner and cry. Forever.  I got my HTML codes working though. Figured out javascript damn fine. Look out, learning frames, and re-building my website. Watch for the updates.
