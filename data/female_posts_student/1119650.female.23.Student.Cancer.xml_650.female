Toronto has all the things about Canada that I love: my dollar going further, stronger drinks, clean streets,  urlLink Roots , hockey and none of the stuff I hated about Montreal (the rude attitude  all the Frenchness).  I would go back (and maybe even move there) in a heartbeat, but first I'd like to go back to the Caribbean.  Anyhow, Friday we travelled there, checked in and checked out the area around our hotel.  We were staying downtown about 2 blocks from the  urlLink Eaton Centre  so we snooped around in there and came back to the hotel and swam.  We headed out to dinner and stumbled upon one of the best restaurants I've probably ever eaten:  urlLink Brown Stone Bistro  on Yonge street.  I had a delicious (albeit burningly strong) mango-appley martini, bacon-wrapped filet mignon in a red wine demiglace (perfectly cooked and seasoned the most deliciousway I've ever eaten a steak!).  Yummy deserts as well.  A perfect beginning to our evening.  We eventually came across "Hoops" a sports bar/hooters-esque kind of place where the boy and I put back quite a few drinks.  I ended up with the hiccups (Imagine bugs bunny after a few swigs from the XXX jug, lol) and discovered the perfect failproof cure for them.  A great night for our first night in town.  Saturday we went to the  urlLink Hockey Hall of Fame  which I have to say was *really* awesome.  I was pleasantly suprrised.  It was very cool to see the Stanley cup (and the real one and the vault in which its contained), the old jerseys were also really cool too.  They had a small collection of goalie masks (I was hoping there'd be more to look at) the old fashioned ones were just scary looking and Andrew played goalie and forward in the simulation games.  Next we headed over to the  urlLink CN Tower  which is the world's tallest building which was kind of cool.  We rode this lego simulator ride which was a lil cheezy but fun none the less.  There was CRAZY security there which I felt fine about and I even managed to go out on the glass floor,  scared as I may have been I got out there for a picture of it just so I *never* have to do it again, haha.  We had lunch at the skydome which was cool and then headed back to the hotel.  We napped, watched some of the Tampa Bay  Philly game and then headed out to an atrocious dinner.  A dinner so bad and so overpriced that I won't even say where we ate.  Drinks at the  urlLink Wolf  Firkin Pub  wound out the night.    Sunday we went back to Brownstone for brunch, walked around, shopped and saw Troy (the Paramount theatre in Toronto's entertainment district is the BEST movie theatre ever!.  I know you're thinking "what the hell did you go to the movies for if you were on vacation?" (well, maybe you're not wondering but I'll justify it to you anyhow) we had done all we wanted to do that we *could* do weather permitting and we needed to kill some time.  Dinner at  urlLink Wayne Gretzky's  was delicous and started us on our Sunday evening pub crawl which ended up being some trival pursuit questions at another firkin pub and then triple shots at this weird little hole in the wall.    All in all an absolutely awesome trip, lots of fun, good company, shopping and dining.  Toronto is where its at, kids.
