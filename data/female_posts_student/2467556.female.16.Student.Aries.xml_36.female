But your idea was such a good one!!!!!  I'll just say that this is copyright Nadia Kudsi 2004.  Ok here we go!   Brittnee McCutchin   (Freshman Year) When i first saw Brittnee, i thought she was a complete bitch/slut.  I knew she was in my Biology class and i remember this one time where i asked her a question and she totally blew me off.  At this point, i decided she was a popular bitch person.  Well this one time, i think we were in this group for some skit in Drama and we had to work together.  She was talking about this guy that she thought was the hottest guy she'd ever seen.  I asked her who it was and she said she had no idea.  Well, she described him and i figured out that it was this guy who was an ok attractive person that had been stalking me since the second week of school.  She said that he knew he was a hockey player though.  And i was like "OMG that is so totally my stalker".  She thought this was really funny and we became friends.  As the tri went on, i told her who i had a crush on and she finally saw him one day and gave her approval.  We discovered through reliable sources that this kid that she liked so much was canadian and throughout this passage we will refer to him as "Randy Andy" (LOL Brittnee!!!!).  We called him Randy Andy because he checked out every and i mean EVERY girl that crossed his path.  Well horny doesn't really rhyme with anything and so we adopted the brit word for it called Randy and rhymed it with Andy.  Anyways, we discovered that the guy i liked (who will be referred to as Maraccas....LOL again Brittnee!!) and she liked were good friends and therefore in time we became BEST FRIENDS.  We also both discovered that we thought Niko Kapanen (finnish guy on Dallas Stars) and Brenden Morrow(Canadian guy on Dallas Stars), people from Canada and Finland, were hot.  So began our friendship and the Finland-Canada obsession, LOL Britt!  We did literally everything together, but at that time she wasn't in dance anymore.  We went to the last half of the hockey season for Coppell which was about 12-15 games to support my hockey player and the team (because i liked hockey and brittnee liked the hot guys, lol JK britt love ya!)and for Brittnee, to hopefully see Randy Andy.  We went to one JV Black game to see Brittnee's Randy Andy and it was free so i didn't have a problem with it.  We became part of "The Original 10" which we refer to ourselves and the other 8 students that came to the games before Coppell won State and all.  We were there when Coppell acquired their first ever loss at Metroplex and when they won State.  I swear we banged on the glass so hard, that our hands were bruised and we yelled so much that our voices were gone for 2 days.  Blah blah blah blah time went on and we still had our crushes.  And she was always there for me, giving me advice, telling me to shutup when i was overreacting and calming me down after she told me to shutup.  She helped me overanalyze things to endth degree and we had and will continue to have good times together.  Oh man we have so many dirty jokes about our boys, its not even funny!  She was still there for me after what happened last summer and was there for me after what carried on throughout the year.  She was there for me on my dates, was even at my house for one of them LOL!!!   She always makes me feel better and whenever i needed her most, she's always there to bring me out of my stupidity and depression, lol.  So that is the story of how me and Brittnee met and became best friends.  Just think, if it hadn't been for those guys that we liked so much we would have never been best friends!!!   And thats the friend story of the week.....Brittnee McCutchin.....I LOVE YOU BRITTNEE!!!! LOL, remember the finnish chicken and the canadian cow, the Lariette designer drugs, shortness, IMing, 2010 Winter Olympics Vancouver, hand in the pocket......and all the really funny jokes we had!!!  Good times!!!
