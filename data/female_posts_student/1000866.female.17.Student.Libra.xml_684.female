I wish he'd friggin' trust one of his own best friends even though..heh....we aren't best friends anymore. However, you'd think the kid wouldn't bend over backward and lose his friends. I guess I knew it all along but I guess I was also sort of denying it at the same time. I really had no proof. It's just what I thought. But now....argh.   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.   People suck.
