She talked to Michael forever and three days on the phone as I did with Alek, until his phone died out. Anyway, we crashed out at about 4 or so and then woke up at like 1. She called her mom to pick her up or whatever, so she left, and then I took a shower and went shopping with my mamma. I got two pairs of pants for school, some school shirts, and a jacket, which I thought was pretty cute. I didn't do anything when I got home. I've been so tired lately! I really just did not have  energy to do anything at all. Hmmm. Oh yeah, I saw Sena walking downtown, and that guy that's always all on his girlfriend at school, I don't know his name, but I know he's one of Jonathan's friends. So I was like, geeze, is it just the day to see people that Jonathan knows? Things like this happen to remind of schoo, and then of course that reminds me that school is going to suck. Eeww, school is going to suck! I have to go back sometime next week to get the hell out of the Media magnet programs bull. It takes up two classes! TWO CLASSES! That's so stupid, I have other classes I need to get out of my way, so I'm gonna be taking P.E. this year, and hopefully Spanish and Theatre Arts so I get those credits or whatever. But enough about school. Hmmm.....I haven't talked to Alek today, cuz he's in Austin? I think, or so he said he was going to be. But he could always be lying. Not that I think he would do that, but there's people that do that, "I'm gonna be out of town tomorrow, but I don't know when I'll be back, so I'll just give you a call," or well at least I know I do that. I hope I'm not the only bitch out there that does it. I just got through checking my mail a little while ago, and Adan wrote an apology email, though I can't write back, because I need to keep him out of my life. I guess it's more of a thing of pride. It's the whole, "I'm not gonna call him, if he wants to talk to me he can call," thing. Well shit, I'm tired of typing, so I'll check back in later. Oh shit, I remember his name!!! His name is Ricardo, or at least I think it is.....Oh! And I saw Stephanie Hernandez at the mall too.
