But i wouldn't would i? Wish i could tell her or get rid of her, hes worth so much more to be second best, thats the way it seems, Marc is lovely, but Jason was and i guess kind of is my world and i think Laura's heart lays with Marc still. Working 21 hours this week, means more overtime at the end of the Month but i just seem to waste it on stupid things. Results on the 19th having a hissy fit over them, and i keep using Danielle's words which isn't good! Lol, and i need to go on a god damn diet thingy, everyone is so skinny, Laura, Danielle, and i need to stop eating.  ~Lisa~
