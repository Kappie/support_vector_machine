I need to be in an AP History one, so please, let me get in on it!   Monday Plans outside of studying: Given the fact that we have the entire day basically, I say we picnic and cube while we have off hours from studying! haha. That park is a beautiful place though, even for non-cubing. I am actually suprised there weren't little make-out pairs up there. Hm, who knew? Anyway, back on track! Monday plans should involve a healthful mixture of food, fun, books, and people. In other words, I think we should Togo's it up at teh park with some cubes and coffee and towels perhaphs. Oh, and for those of you not into cubing, think of it this way: There is no way we could possibly spend more than, say, 2 hours MAX doing it. That is a small portion of the day, all things considered. So hey, let's have a fun one, okay everyone? Wow, this makes me feel like I am on a Little League team.  Oh and hey- what did you guys do tonight? Bet you can all guess who I did. I mean, what I did. ha. ha. (calm down Billy, I was kidding!!)
