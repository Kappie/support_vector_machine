You had to fill out this little application, post it, and then people would vote yes or no on you. This particular girl didn't make it in because she said she didn't like The Beatles.  Okay. I have no problem with The Beatles. I have no problems with people who like The Beatles. But, I know what I'm about to say is blasphemy, but I really don't like The Beatles. I really don't. One of the people who voted no on the girl said "No. You don't like the Beatles. They're legendary." Oh, okay. That's a reason to like them? Lots of things are legendary. Charles Manson is "legendary." Does that mean I have to like him, too? Legendary isn't a synonym for "good." I don't care if they're legendary, I don't like their music. Maybe they were pioneers in rock and roll, and I guess I can be grateful for that because if they hadn't done what they did, the music scene would be a lot different today. But forgive me for not liking their music. I have run across a few songs by them that I do like, but not enough to say that I am a Beatles fan.   But I think it's really retarded that all these people are like "oh my gosh you hate The Beatles! HOW COULD YOU!" Yeah, there are people who don't like The Beatles. AMAZING, I know. But if I said "oh yeah, I like The Beatles, they're... legendary" I would feel like a loser who was only saying that to avoid people telling me to die and that they hate me because of it. But even if people do tell me that, I'm not going to care, because strangely enough, I feel that there are more important things to spend my time debating over. I'm not going to waste my time defending why I don't like The Beatles when there actually is more to life than some 16 year old girl's music tastes and how they clash with yours.  So I don't like The Beatles. Hopefully, you can get over it. If you can't, well, then that's your problem and I'll see you once you get out of group therapy with other people who can't handle my opinions on things.  Here is a list of bands/singers that I DO like, just so you can get even more riled up to not see The Beatles mentioned.  Switchfoot, Rooney, Foo Fighters, Jars of Clay, Some Kind of Hero, The Smiths, Coldplay, Finger Eleven, Joseph Arthur, Dashboard Confessional, Norah Jones, DC Talk (Kevin Max), John Mayer, Incubus, Anberlin, Badly Drawn Boy, Dido, Evan and Jaron, The Elms, Lifehouse, Filter, Mindy Smith, Foolish Things, David Crowder Band, Hoobastank, The Calling, The Lyndsay Diaries, Semisonic, Sixpence None the Richer, Ben Folds (Five), Michelle Branch, Seven Places, Copeland, Further Seems Forever, Sanctus Real, the beautiful mistake, Yellowcard.
