I'm sitting at my desk right now in sweatpants and my bikini, pretending I live in California where it is normal to do so. There's no real reason for me to do this except that it was only 80 today, and I am rebelling against the unusally cool Texas summer.  Camping was very relaxing. The dogs behaved, the weather was nice, and the lake was beautiful. The swim beach at the state park we were at is down a long flight of steps that winds through the woods and ends up in a cove with cliffs towering above it on either side. The water was incredibly clear for lake water and the bottom of the lake actually was pretty weed-free.   The only bad part about my mini-vacation is the fact that I have about fifteen mysterious bug bites from my knees to my waist. Hell, my  bug bites  have bug bites. All this itching is about to drive me insane because if one bite isn't itching, four others are. No, really.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  itchy scratchy bitch slappy!  listening to/watching ::  my dad's oldies CD; oldies are the lost gem of the music world.  eating/drinking ::  nothing...we'll have to remedy that.  craving ::  to be itch-free!  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  I HATE BUGS!  wishing ::  that *he* would call...  wearing ::  sweat pants and a red bikini top...yeah I'm weird.  random ::  I ITCH! Oh, and I actually am starting to like reading The Chosen.
