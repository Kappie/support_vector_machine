I feel like I can't touch anything because if I do.....it will all be ruined. I put all my stuffed animals...well, not all, some of them are on my shelf, but a lot of stuffed animals on my bed for the first time in a long long time. I'm going to try to sleep with them on there. Usually, I sleep with one or two stuff animals but I have like, 15 on my bed right now, and then maybe another 15 on my shelf. And THEN, there's the ones out in the shed, and my beanie babies. Wow, I never realized how many stuffed animals I have...I guess I liked them as a child. Actually...I still like them, hehe. So, my day wasn't a complete waste although I didn't do anything that I was planning on doing. Ah well, such is life. I did something much more productive...not as fun...but more productive!
