This morning I woke up and found that nothing in my room was out of place, so I assumed that I had been dreaming.  When I got out of bed, I talked to Aiko, my roommate, who asked me if I had felt the earthquake last night.  Apparently, "temblos" are quite common here.  Aiko told me that last month, while she was here alone, there was one that registered 5.5.   Today I walked around a lot to try to get to know the city.  It really is a great place to be.   The historic district, where I live, is always bustling with people.  Today it was exceptionally busy because it was the first day of school for all the Mexican children and there were lots of kids running around in their clean uniforms.  The zocolo is the main square in town, it reminds me of any plaza mayor in Spain.  It is the main meeting place of everyone here, and there are always tons of people there.  It is completely surrounded by little restaurants and cafes.  There are a number of men who have set up little spots to shine shoes, lots of tables where women sell hand made crafts, and of course there are few stands where people sell very cheesey plastic touristy things.  Everyday, as I get to know the city better, I feel better about being here.  I am really enjoying everything Oaxaca has to offer.  ¡Hasta Pronto!
