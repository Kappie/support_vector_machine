However, when Democrats finally realize that this New Jersey situation could hurt them and force McGreevy to resign, Kerry will, in fact, be on the top of that list (since Barney Frank has been quiet lately.)  President Bush announced on Monday that 100,000 troops will be reassigned from their positions in South Korea and Europe. This makes a lot of since, especially considering the purpose of having troops in such places to begin with. We needed troops in Europe during the Cold War because the United States realizes that strength and power brings added responsibility. The Cold War has ended and having troops in Europe is no longer the necessity it once was.  John Kerry, in typical election year criticism, says,     "Nobody wants to bring troops home more than those of us who have fought in foreign wars, but it needs to be done at the right time and in a sensible way. This is not that time or that way."  That's interesting, because two weeks ago Kerry was on the record saying,  "If the diplomacy that I believe can be put in place can work, I think we can significantly change the deployment of troops not just there but elsewhere in the world, in the Korean peninsula, perhaps, in Europe, perhaps."  They don't call him flipper for nothin'.
