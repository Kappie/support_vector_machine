It's a new disease. Catch it soon.  Today was very eventfull, stressful and full of self-realization! I hate it.  I dont know why I do the things I do, like keep this blog, write in a journal, talk the way I talk, dress the way I do, act the way I do. I have no clue. There's so many things about myself that I want to change, that I cant. I want to be thinner, I want to be taller, I want to be nicer. There's so many things. Belive it or not, there's so many things that you can come up with while writing a french paper. I came with a new slanguage. Oh well. I'll write it later. My head hurts. I dont feel good. And Im the biggest nerd you ever knew.   But as McCabe said. Im a princess. But thats Princess Taltua to you!
