I talked to Tony last night and he has a friend that might be able to fix my car for a cheaper rate. That would be lovely now wouldn't it. Lettuce pray.  I'm trying to be in a better mood and smile and stuff and pretend that I'm as happy as I was about three months ago. I miss school.  I can't wait til it starts again. I'm going for a 4.0 this year. That would bring my gpa up from a 1.9 to a ... 2.1.Funny if it does. I'd cry so much.   This song describes how I feel right now: (Well, not the whole song - cuz don't nobody be rippin' my slips downtown.) (And if you change skid row to Racine...now that doesn't work. Just go with it people.)  Poor!  All my life I've always been poor. I keep asking God what I'm for, and he tells me "Gee, I'm not sure.  Sweep that floor, kid." Oh, I started life as an orphan, a child of the street Here on skid row. He took me in, gave me shelter, a bed, crust of bread and a job Treats me like dirt, calls me a slob,  Which I am  So I live  Downtown That's your home address. Ya live  Downtown  When your life's a mess. Ya live  Downtown  Where depressions' jes'  Status Quo.  Down on skid row  Someone showme a way to get outta here.  Cause I constantly pray I'll get outta here.  Please won't somebody say I'll get outta of here.  Someone gimme my shot or I'll rot here.  (Last I heard these were lyrics in that song too. But they weren't on the website that has the score. Veird!)  Show me how and I will, I'll get outta here.  I'll start climbin' up hill and get outta here.  Someone tell me I still could get outta here.  Someone tell lady luck that I'm stuck here!  Gee it sure would be swell to get outta here.  Bid the gutter farewell and get outta here. I'd move heaven and hell to get outta Skid.  I'd do I dunno what to get outta Skid.  But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid.  People tell me there's not a way outta Skid. But believe me I gotta get outta Skid Row!  Thank you! Thank you! I'm here all week.
