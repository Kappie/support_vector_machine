That also means you're a good mediator â€” though you may prefer to spend more time on your own than most.  You are better equipped than many to steer your life in the right direction. Understanding more about the components of your personality will reveal unique information that even people like you might not realize. And the better you know yourself, the more confident you'll be making decisions that affect your life.   And that's just scratching the surface!   hahaxx..can u bliff it? i dun even bliff it manx..
