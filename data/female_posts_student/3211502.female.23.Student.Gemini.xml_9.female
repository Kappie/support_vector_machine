Understandbly, he was insulted. He then proceeded to point out that Madonna is 47 years old, aka old. I then pointed out that just because Madonna is 47 years old, that didn't mean that she catered to an audience of people from her generation. But, anyways, eventually, he told me that I could to the concert with my mother if I was able to go home that weekend. Yay (weak).
