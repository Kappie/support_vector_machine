It's really cute. It's black and red. I'm not going to describe any more of it because I don't want my date knowing, lol, I want it to be a suprise. Other than that sunday was uneventful. Just the mall. Monday was like any other monday. My photo teacher still hates me but likes Kari now. She always sends her on little arrands around the school now. I swear. Today was really boring, Lynzi left for sunriver and I might leave tomarrow but I'm not sure, it depends on the snow. You know the new Dashboard Confessional song, Hands Down, I LOVE that song! I just had to share. I really want that new CD. Oh I got 47 out of 50 on my spanish oral, so I was really happy. Haha today on the test my teacher put "el gato es muy feo y malo" and for you non-spanish speakers that means "the cat is very ugly and bad" I started cracking up. Paul Walker was on The View this morning and I taped it, I hope I got it all because I started it late. I had Paul Walker on the Late Show already on the tape and I'm really hoping The View didn't tape over it or skip any parts with Paul. Hes so gorgous! His new movie comes out tomarrow! Oh and also The Starting Line's new acoustic ep came out today. I've downloaded almost all the songs but I'm still asking for it for christmas. It's pretty good. Today after school I had a really bad stomache ache but it went away after I took something for it. It's weird because I've been feeling kind of iffy latley. Maybe if I don't feel good tomarrow we won't have to go to Sunriver. Some of you might ask why..I'll tell ya...I don't want to spend fricken 4 days with Mark. (To refresh Mark is my moms boyfriend.) Anywho, I better go! Adios! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
