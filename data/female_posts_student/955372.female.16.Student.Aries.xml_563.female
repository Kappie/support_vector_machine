The bad news is that if you didn't have experts like us on the case, you'd never even know it. Your mutant potential needs to be developed, coaxed out like the last drop of toothpaste from the very bottom of the tube. Keep doing your thing, and one day that mutant ability just might show itself. If not, might we suggest attending a fine institution like the Xavier School for Gifted Students. We hear their biology department is excellent.
