Who's got their claws In you my friend? Into your heart I'll beat again Sweet like candy to my soul Sweet you rock, And sweet you roll Lost for you, I'm so lost for you  Oh, and you come crash into me And I come into you And I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Touch your lips just so I know In your eyes, love, it glows so I'm bare-boned and crazy... for you.  Oh, and you come crash into me Baby, and I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  And if I've gone overboard Then I'm begging you To forgive me In my haste When I'm holding you so girl, Close to me  Oh and you come crash into me, yeah Baby, and I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more And show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more And show your world to me In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Oh, I watch you there Through the window And I stare at you You wear nothing, but you Wear it so well Tied up and twisted, The way I'd like to be For you, for me, come crash into me, baby Come crash into me, yeah  Crash into me... Crash into me... Crash into me...  You know, I'm the king of the castle, You're the dirty rascal, crash into me. Please crash into me, baby...  Oh, no no no... Yes, I see the waves Come and crash into me. See the waves come and crash into me. Crash into me.  ______________________________________________  Well howdy! That was a good day. Strangely. Today, I got to get out of 2 and 3 period to go to my dental surgery analysis... crap that's gonna suck... all wisdom teeth removed, 2nd molar removed. That's really gonna suck. But yeah then me and mah Daddah went to Taco Del Mar and it was yummy. Then school just FLEW by.... I missed the period that I had to turn in the huge rough draft of my research paper that I was up late for last night.. oh well it wasn't very good and now I have the weekend to do it. Anywaaaays... in journalism we had pizza (finally... a week after the paper comes out), and I had a big burrito for lunch, then me, Charlotte, Erinn, and Michelle hung out then we had really yummy ice cream at GyroWorld in Factoria... then we came here and ate pizza.... I've had a lot of food today. Blech. We played with my little guinea pig and he made little birdy noises. Tomorrow I'm chillin' with Ryan in Seattle maybe, and Sunday I will work on my research paper (kind of). It's making out to be a pretty good weekend! Each week seems to be faster and faster as we get towards summer, this will be the best summer ever! I can't wait.....!!! I think we get our yearbooks next week. 3 weeks til the seniors graduate. And almost one month til we're OUTTA here. Elvis has left the building!  PS. Holy crap! i was just looking at the calender and we have only 25 more days of school left (not counting weekends)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
