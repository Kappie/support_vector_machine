Some may misinterpret that to mean you're more timid than others when it comes to love, school, and life in general. But really, we suspect it's just that you focus more on driving toward your goals than announcing them to the world. While some people have to stand at a podium to stake their territorial claims — on guys, teams, or the honor roll — you're more likely to take a less direct route. (After all, it's easier to make your point when you're not caught like a deer in the spotlight.) A level-headed discussion with someone close to your issue, if not the person directly, is more your style — whether feeling out if your crush is already taken or asking your parents for a much-deserved raise in allowance. Your careful approach usually pans out better than creating a dramatic scene before a gawking audience. Sure, you go after what you want in life. But your style has never been to grab the bull by the horns. The patience you've cultivated has no doubt helped you become who you are today — a devoted friend, daughter, girlfriend, or student. So keep at it — picking your private battles. Then stand back to watch your bashful blush work its passionate magic!
