A world where everything is crystal clear to the reader, and yet where new things seem to be happening all the time. You belong in a world where your free-thought puts you above the silly masses, and where bright eyes and intelligence are enough to attract the arrogant millionaire/prejudiced young woman of your choice.    urlLink   Which Classic Novel do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     ive actually never read this book and i didnt even care about what quiz it is ... it just fed my feining for random quizes i find on the net... i think i may need help lol
