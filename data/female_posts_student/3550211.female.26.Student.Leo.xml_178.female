Or, at the very least, reminding you of things that you already love.   Last week I introduced the "New Rules," which ,by the way, will be posted either later today or tomorrow, and now I'm announcing that Scars Of Tomorrow, will indeed incorporate music at an entirely new level. This should not come as a big surprise. I've already left hints here and there that music is one, if not the most, important thing in my life. I simply could not live with out it. I'm not going to get carried away right now on my musical taste, except to say, I love almost all types. I'm sure you all already know punk is my favorite, so that is mostly likely what I will be linking. However, don't be utterly surprised if some hip-hop gets thrown in here. It's not all bad, I promise you.  Anyway, I'm not quite sure how I'm going to work out all the little details, but I'm not really worried about it. Most likely, when a song catches my fancy, I'll find a MP3 link, the lyrics, and then share it with you. I think this sounds pretty damn fun. So. Let's get this party started.  Ladies and Gents - it's time to put some pussy in your punk!  Today's song is  urlLink Take The Reins  by the punk band,  urlLink Tsunami Bomb .   I also happen to know them, and got to hang out with them during the 2003 Warped Tour. I know, I know. I'm so freakin' cool, eh?  Winks.      I was just listening to this song earlier, and I had an overwhelming desire to share. And would you look at that â€¦ birth to a new blogging category.  Here are the lyrics. And have fun.    ::Take The Reins::   18, you think you're free To be what you wanna be Have a job or 2 or 3, you'll say you're sorry Don't try to run or fight Ask how or when or why Who cares what's wrong or right? It's money that matters  Each day just like the next We struggle on and on In nightmares but we're still marching Handcuffed to life again Don't try, they'll only push you down What's opportunity? You've got what you wanted now  How long till I'm my own? Independence doesn't start when you leave home   Locked in, can't get out Your cube is your new home 4 walls, no windows, no doors Hancuffed to life again Don't try, they'll only push you down  What's opportunity? You've got what you wanted now!      UPDATE:  Brought to you by   urlLink www.purevolume.com . Go ahead and listen to their other songs since you're there! Don't be afraid.
