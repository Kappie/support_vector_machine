I've listened and watched all three. The Ultra Zone shows a totally different side of Vai as compared to his previous songs that I've heard. Ultra Zone features a more melodious Vai, instead of his usual hyper-speed shredding style. But a few tracks in this album sound a little foreign. Vai has employed the use of some Pan-Arabian vocals and Indian-like tunes. I didn't like the singing, the female singer sounds all whinny and I don't understand Arab/Tamil or whatever the language she's singing in. Luckily most of the tracks are instrumentals.   G3 was a whole new experience for me. Satriani's anthems like Summer Song still sounds as refreshing as when I first heard it. Eric Johnson's fantastic use of chord voicings in his tunes never fails to leave me in awe. Although he looks and plays like anything, but a guitar rock idol. And Steve Vai's guitargod image in addition to his weird noises and the way he abuses his guitar totally rocked the stage off. I can't wait till his concert in three weeks' time.  I missed Linkin Park's Live In Texas Concert on Channel 5. Thank God for DVDs. Actually it was more or less the same as their MTVs. except for the frequent brawls among the audiences. Chester is still screaming his throat off. I could see his veins bulging out. I wonder how many lozenges he has to take just to get through one gig. Mr. Hahn was the only one who didn't sweat from all that jumping around because all he does is move his middle finger up and down the disc. Their second last song 'A Place In My Head' was the ultimatum when they smashed up that Ibanez. (They smashed up all the remaining gear after everything was over.) I think I'm going to watch everything all over again before returning them the CDs this Saturday. What to do, there's nothing else worth watching on TV nowadays.
