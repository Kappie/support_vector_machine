I'd rather not give a detailed account of the last 6 days, but just know that they went well and shopping was involved! The only thing I hate is that I haven't talked to Arturo in agesssss and I want to talk to him soon. Hopefully we can get back to talking on a regular basis once ctd is over :-D (lol, Arturo if your reading this I bet you just cringed..hehe).   I got text messaging added to my phone plan! Woot! Now all ya'll peoples that I know can text message me instead of racking and tacking on my daytime minutes. It's a handy lil feature. Now SJ can update me anytime of the day. Hehe. Speaking of sj...  Anyways, yeah, so this post isn't going to be very exciting, but I thought I would post some stuff I stole from some people who stole some stuff from other people (I.E online surveys and such).
