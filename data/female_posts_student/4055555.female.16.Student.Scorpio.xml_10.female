I went to bed pretty late last night at 3ish after setting up a website. I was all snuggled up in bed about to nod off when to my annoyance I heard a buzzing sound. I jumped out of bed armed with my highway code book (I'm learning some stuff for my theory already!) waiting for the fly to show itself. I did some kung fu moves on it but it the slick bugger got away... again again and again. I must have been after it for about 10 minutes or so when it decided to hide behind my cupboards. I tried flapping my highway code around for a bit to see if it would come back out, but no show, so I left it and finally got to sleep.      In the morning I got up and went to the loo and to my dismay there was a fly buzzing around. ARGH! Can't they fly elsewhere?      Other than that the day was ok. Just messed about making a site and played a couple of rounds on good old CounterStrike and John came round. We played on Worms Armageddon for a while with Jay, ate a yummy chinese and then watched Michelle get kicked from Big Bro... I thought it was gonna be Jason tonight! How wrong was I! And because Friday TV is good (it's been better I know) I've been glued to the box for most of the evening! But of course I had a little time left to sign my blog, and here I am!      Anyways, bed for me now. Anyone got a fly swatter?      Signing out... xxx
