But I still have plenty of day left for it to go either way. Down or Up. Bad or Good.  I'm hoping for good but I doubt it. I've already done something I know I'll be regretting and hating myself over later. I don't know why exactly I always do that. I don't think I'll ever figure that out.  I need a job. I need money. My family doesn't make much money and I hate buying things because I feel horrible and like I shouldn't because I should be helping to save up money. And I just bought a shirt off the internet today that I've been saving up for. It was 19.95 but then 8 bucks for tax and 90 cents for the money order's tax so that's almost 30 bucks. Anyway, there is so much I'd like to buy.   Some bands I really wish I had some album or anything by them. Bands that I like so much that I really ought to own at least an EP or something by them but I don't. I don't have any money for it.   I have Morrissey's Bona Drag on a cassette because it was 3 bucks and that's all I have of that. I really want to get anything by Morrissey on CD. I like that cassette alot but they are such a hassle for me to listen to because I don't have a stereo, just my computer to play music.    P.S. Don't forget Ian Curtis today.    Music:  Wonderboy - Tenacious D
