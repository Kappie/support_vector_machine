He said that afternoon when they did mail call, and he heard his name, he knew exactly what it was. He had told me that he was bummed all weekend because he couldn’t call home and he missed me. He also wanted to tell me that they were getting their weapons issued and set to start 21-day field training within the next day. He wasn’t too sure where they were going to be at but he thought it would still be somewhere in Texas. Then yesterday morning he called me. He said asked me to guess where he was but I didn’t know. He told me that he was in the middle of B.F.E. (bum F**k Egypt) New Mexico. He told me that where they were he could see nothing but dirt for miles and off in the horizon mountains. They also upgraded sleeping quarters. He told me that now they were in buildings instead of a giant circus tent, granite the buildings they were going to be sleeping in dated back to WWII, but he said to me at least there are walls and a ceiling. He said they were about 20 miles or so from where the first Nuclear Bomb was tested. I asked how he weather was and he told me is was very windy and he had to stand behind a convoy to block the wind so he could hear me.   I am so glad they go to start this portion of their training because this is what he has been waiting for. I am pretty sure this is the portion of mobilization where they get to learn about how to handle themselves in battle situations. I hope for their sakes they never have to use the skills they are going to learn. He should be getting back to Ft. Bliss around his Birthday and a few weeks later off they go overseas, somewhere. We still don’t know where they are going to be stationed but I pray every night that it will be somewhere safe. Jesse is working with a great bunch of guys and I know they will watch each other’s backs. So that does comfort me a lot. I just want all of this to go by fast so he can be on his way home instead of soon to be departing.  In other news we are almost done with moving me out of the apartment. I am so greatful for my mom and my brother for being there to help me. I made them a promise that onces this is all done I am going to ake them out to dinner with the cleaning deposit we get back. I told my mom that I wanted to take them to Red Lobster... maybe well go to Joe's Crab Shack instead. I am set to be out of the apartment next tuesday. and I have a good feeling about it. I have noticed in the last few days I have spent at my mom's house I have not had problems sleeping. aBefore I would stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Once everything is finished I look forward to plenty of good night sleep.
