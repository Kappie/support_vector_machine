Yay. betsy's birthday is also soon approaching and i have to get a super cool present. aside from that, i have to go to a children's bible camp meeting tonight because i'm going to be a happy teacher for the younguns. camping is so cool! i want to camp every day. except i don't like waking up sweaty. that's a bit gross. i also didn't enjoy being locked out of the house and then having to guard the tent. but i suppose that was better than running around the house in socks. it was fun. i want to go to ikea. those swedes have made it all.       i chung you: i hope aaron marsh comes to your birthday fiesta!    i chung you: haha   IrishDancin83: yeah! well it could be likely because they'll be in town for the concert   i chung you: yeah actually    i chung you: ha i would cry   i chung you: i'm not even kidding   IrishDancin83: hahaha me too   i chung you: he would ring the doorbell and i would melt    i chung you: and then hug him   ---   IrishDancin83: ahhhhhhhhjjjjjhhhhhhhhh   IrishDancin83: i know!!!!!   IrishDancin83: the "j" key got in the way
