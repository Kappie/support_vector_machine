Only one day in D-town and then I'm Joliet-bound to see Augy before he leaves for Boston for 2 weeks.  I think he's nervous about flying - I've flown plenty of times and I still get nervous.  But I also think anyone in their right mind is a little nervous before any flight, even if they have flown a hundred times.  I'm happy for him that he gets to go experience the DNC.  But I have to find something to entertain myself for 2 weeks while he's there (no 2 am phone calls, blah).  I'm sure my friend Dara will cook something up for me!  Augy better bring me back something from Boston (well as long as that something does not have to do with the Red Sox!).    I used to love summer breaks till I got to college.  Now I just rather stay in school.  Sounds sick doesn't it?  Well, considering what I do during the school year (least of which is studying), maybe its not so farfetched afterall.   I spend most of my time in meetings, "union dwelling"/office hours,  spending time with friends outside university grounds, classes when I go, and studying in that order.  I love easy majors!  I don't want to enter the real workforce yet; maybe I should get a third bachelors in Law Enforcement or RPTA?  Nah...
