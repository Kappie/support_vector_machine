But with a twist!  A really horrible twist!  They hold singing auditions, but they only choose the WORST singers!  They give them hopes that they are PHENOMENAL!  And apparently, once they build up their ego, they will let them know that it was all a prank.  How horrible is this??  How   low   can these producers go??  Is this what America wants to see?  People being humiliated, laughed at!!  These judges just sit there and LIE to these poor souls!  Tsk tsk...  Oh, speaking of American Idol... I hope Fantasia wins.  There's something about Diana that I dislike... But yeah... that's my spiel.  As for my daily happy list... 1)"G'morning, Hollywood." 2)I found out the chords for "Million Years From Now". 3)Got more funky lookin' shades, heehee!!
