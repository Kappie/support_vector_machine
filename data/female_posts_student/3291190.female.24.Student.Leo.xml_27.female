    
       
      the blood  a shard from the glass you broke still remains on the floor. I tie back my hair into a pony tail, tossing you  the memory out the door. this night, I am all that there is. I find my greatest joy in this emptiness. I run out the door to discover another world outside. my secret smile, my anger  opinions I no longer hide. this world is mine, alive, fresh  brand new. I found myself again, but to do this, first I had to lose you.
