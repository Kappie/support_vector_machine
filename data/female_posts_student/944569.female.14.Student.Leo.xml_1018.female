Listened to 8 music cds so far…ate at Mickey D’s (hahha, Adam taught me that term! New Vocabulary!)  I’m going to get  Universal studios soon.  It will be too late to play there. Of course.  It will be around 3:00 pm when I get there.  Ho hum, I wonder if anyone else is going to Universal Studios.  Half of my brother’s class is going…*yawn* I ate 2 krispy kreme doughnuts (mmm…..) and tried some guacamole flavoured Doritos (blech, they’ve been coloured with spinach green powder followed by red and yellow dots.  They don’t even taste like guacamole!!! Ugh, I have a headache and don’t want to read my French book nor try to write properly in English.  I saw cotton and chicken farms all the way.  Usually, I enjoy long car rides but this rental car is all cramped.  The bags in front are blocking my leg room (aaah,! This is hell!  My poor legs…must stretch…legs….) and I’m pretty squeamish about public places that aren’t clean (honestly, I make a big deal about  cleanliness in public places.  If there’s any mould on the walls or a bit of food on the table, I don’t want to touch it.)  Well then,  I’ve spent a few minutes staring at Links, the cat, my new office assistant.  So cute…(meow)  Messed up cat I tried to make:  /\      /(=^.^=) | O O| O---- O   You know what’s the worst thing?  When you’re trapped in a car, carsick, and the smell of nasty burger and fries are in the air.  Also, when there’s a nastier fly stuck in the car as well.  Not a normal black fly, a gray one with green specks and who is terrorizing your poor brother.  You know what’s even worse?  When there’s nothing to do in the car  and you completely numben your brain’s instincts to kill yourself by writing a log of all the happenings.  Hmmm….I’ll read the billboards….”Crime and Punishment Museum.  Next turn”  oooh…sounds interesting…. “Hooters airlines”  Yurk…I don’t even want to think about it….that’s sick… Hooters is a restaurant that degrades feminine morality….You don’t even want to know what my dad said when he saw the sign.  Ugh, he has a strange sense of humour.   Oooooh….Archaelogists found some gold buried near a historic site that could possibly be worth millions…lessee…80 gold coins and crates found buried in the sand….wow…..What else?  Murderer on the loose.  Escaped while on parole.   Killed two female real estate agents.  Feh, coward.  Bullying women like that.  What a lowlife.  SAVE ME!! My dad is playing country music.  AUGH!  I hat e this kind of banjo country music.  AAAAAAAAAAH!!! *smashes window and escapes.  Runs on highway and gets run over by truck* Anyhow, my brother and I were faking exaggerated Canadian accents so that ppl would actually believe we were from Canada.  “We’re, like, frum Canada, eh? Like, thith plathe is purty cool,eh?  What are you talking aboot, eh? “ I read an interesting article on the plane about krispy kremes and why they’re so popular.  They are the most popular in Canada.  There’s a hilarious theory that suggests that the popularity of this pastry rests solely on the fact that it is related to another loved hobby in Canada.  It looks like a hockey puck.  KK doughnuts look like hockey pucks, Canadians love hockey.  Therefore, Canadians love KK doughnuts!   DYNAMIC DEDUCTION!  Now I know why Adam loves those pastries so much.  Mmmmm…..I feel like another doughnut….well, hockey puck or not, these doughnuts are the BEST!  The BEST you hear? I slept for a few hours and guess what?  i've got free internet cable access woohoo!  Life is good.  Life is gooooooooood..
