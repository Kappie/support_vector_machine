They might make the leap to Moscow with me.  The boy and I are about to finish watching Nurse Betty.  Decided to have a Renee marathon after Cold Mountain.  Am liking Nurse Betty more than Chicago, I have to say.  I've been bitter about that movie since its initial release and have now been vindicated.  Yes, it was well done.  Yes, the actors all performed beautifully.  No, it was not better than Moulin Rouge, which every critic admitted in each review's opening paragraph.  And yet, the truly original, campy masterpiece was the red-headed bastard child of 2002's Oscar ceremony while it's safe, comfortable, more-refined looking younger sister walked away with 2003's Best Picture.  At least Nicole got even.  So it's 2004.  Yay.  Pretty unassuming number, really.  Next year will tear the shit up, I'm sure.  But this just gets to be one of those cute, quiet, standing in the corner, waiting for its moment of brilliance years.  Managed to have a great New Year's Eve.  It's always a question: whether the night will be as spectacular as is fabled (expected) to be.  Started at the third viewing of Return of the King; full circle and all.  Saw Fellowship on the first day of 2002, so it's only fitting that the last chapter be seen the last day of 2003.  Ended up at Charley's where the music was the same and the drinks were still free.  Moving even slower today than the last time we stayed out dancing until 2.  But managed to get pretty for dinner with the Grandparents.    "So what's my story?"  The boy asked around 5.  "Who am I?"  "What do you mean?"  "Well, what topics should I stay away from at dinner?"  "Don't mention you're an artist."  "Okay."  "Or that you're in graphic design."  "Okay."  "Grandpa will ask you if you're Jewish."  "And I'll have to say yes."  "Oh just be yourself, Levi!" Mom yelled from the living room.  "Yea, it'll be fine, honey, really."  "You think?"  "You're the boyfriend."  "I guess I should play the part."  Wonder what they think of their newest Grandson-in-Law-to-be.    He waited until they left before slapping my ass.  Mom and Grandma were discussing the poppyseed cake Grandma brought for dessert when the lightning storm began accompanying the blizzard.  The night suddenly became purple and we all gazed outside to catch a glimpse before the thunder followed.  Mom broke the awe-induced silence:   "You know, I've heard the weather has something to do with that."
