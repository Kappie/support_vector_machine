On a serious note I don't know if frustration can get any more frustrating than this.  I can think of a few people I would gladly hit right now or even better I would cut off people's balls so they couldn't produce anymore tainted offspring.  For various reasons I am frustrated and upset....and completely confused.  Went to see a play last night with the school after a drama exam...think I may just about get a D in the exam...but we all thought that last night was going to be a wash out, but it wasn't it was actually lots of fun...Rach, Jill, Amy, Jo and I sat for the hour and a half before the play started on the decking of the bar area and had such a giggle remembering different stories from school.  It was actually lots of fun and I almost pissed myself and I think Rach did.  The play was called 'Our Country's Good' all about convicts who were sent to live in penal collonies in Australia.  It was actually quite interesting.  So today I have taken the day off school because I'm 'tired'.  Actually I just can't face it today.  So I'm going round my mate Joe's to make big fuck off sized sandwhiches and to watch films all day.  I'm gonna miss that kid, in about a month they will be moving :'(  Anyway I gotta go out soon so ttyl dudes  I would just like to add fuck off and rub it in my face a little bit more why don't u?
