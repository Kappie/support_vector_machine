She wanted 2 ask my mom what is was like getting her belly botton pierced... apparently Mr. H is talking her into it... weird. So yeah. Yesterday I read  Midnight Magic  by Avi. It's reallly good. U know the whole, ghostly conspiracies, old world castle w/ hidden passages, secret identities, fate told by tarot cards, a thrill-seeking princess, and a new twist every other paragraph. That's my kind of story!   My mom has bible study ppls over here 2night so I have 2 clean the house while mom's @ work... *sigh* If only I had a life during the summer. Uggh...  This weekend I'm going 2 get my JoJo CD, and mayB another 1 but idk what yet. And then the 23rd I have a dentist appt. and an eye-doctor appt. the 26th. Oh how I love the optomotrist... NOT. I hate getting my i's dialated!!! It's gross...  Well that's all 4 now I guess. TTYL!
