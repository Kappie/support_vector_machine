We bought various stuff- including this awesome canjun trail mix. And then we came back home. No big story there.   I started reading "The Bell Jar" today  It's by Sylvia Plath. So far I've gotten through the first chapter. I admit it's got some potential, but so far my all time favorite read is "Atlas Shrugged", by Ayn Rand. People always wrinkle their noses when they hear that a 15 (age I was when I read it) actually got through that book with some recollection of what it was about. I also hear all this crap about "But your a Christian, why would you want to read a book like that?", I just shrug my shoulders and say, "Why did Darwin rewrite his theory on evolution six times?". I'm an open-minded person. No, that does not mean I'm worldly and hypocritical thank you. I read what I want to read because I feel like reading it- so simple right? I wish. When you tell someone that you have read such and such book, they automatically assume that they can judge your character by the book. What's up with that?!    Aside from my rant  I've got to find something to do. Let's see.... I could make a list! Those are fun. Ok it's settled, I'm making a list.    The List    Top Ten things to do when your bored  1. Make a list 2. Blog 3. Search for good quotes 4. Search for song lyrics 5. Im people you don't know and claim that you know them because you met them at the local walmart 6. Call a pizza place and try to order chinese. (I recommend cheese wontons) 7. Go into a chatroom and, using a translator, speak in a foreign language (french always works for me) 8. Repeat over and over in a AIM window "Mi gusta el naranjas" (I like oranges) 9. Draw sarcastic but very funny drawings all over post-its and stick them to various parts of your house. 10. Pull out the physics book, cover it in meat flavored spaghetti sauce, and yell "Here doggy doggy!".    Bonne Nuit
