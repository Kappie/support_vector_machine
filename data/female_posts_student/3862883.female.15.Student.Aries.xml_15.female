The most similarity from the movie and book I have noticed is all the killing that is taking place. Because of all the killing it shows what type of people are in the storyand movie. Some people die for no reason at all so that the killer can have some moments of pleasure. The bad part about the movie and book is that the killer enjoys it. And they treat the poeple as if they were ants and they could just step all over them. Andanother similarity between the book and movie is that the killers are going crazy. Just the way they act and the description of people make it obviose that they would. They become people that can't be explained. They arefaced withserious promblems within themselves. It will effect everyone mentioned in the book especially people that are not strong willed.
