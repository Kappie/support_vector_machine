That means I don't have to go back after Graduation which rocks because there will be nothing to do anyway.   I've been getting good hits on my site but as of now, I'm working on a reviews site. I will post the link up here as soon as it's all finished so keep that in mind if you would like your site reviewed.   I can't really think of what else to blog about. I'm completely out of ideas. Well, then that's all. See ya everyone!
