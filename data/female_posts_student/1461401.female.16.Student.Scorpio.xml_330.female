Holy god I don't want to be alone again! No more isolation! No more Isolation!  NO MORE ISOLATION!!!!!  DON'T TAKE AWAY MY ONLY CHANCE TO SEE MY FRIENDS! GIVE ME BACK MY FRIENDS! GIVE ME BACK MY LIFE!  YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!    it's funny how the summer can seem like the coldest season of the year.   IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I TRY TO BE SOCIAL OR NOT BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T WORK! I'M GOING TO BE ALONE AND ALONE AND ALONE AND ALONE AND I DON'T WANT THAT AGAIN!!!!!! i can't stand being so alone again. oh god i don't want to be alone anymore. oh god oh god oh god i don't want to be alone...
