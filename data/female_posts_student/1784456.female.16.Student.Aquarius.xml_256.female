Oh also I kind of found a floating dead spider... *cough* Mmm lovely. Can any one out queer me? Nope! Any way about dreams. I had the coolest dreams! We walked into class and we were late and my white coat kind of had rainbow splotches on it, so as you do Mr K asked why we were late. I said that it had been raining paint and chocolate rabbits! Not chocolate rabby rabbits. Like slabs of chocolate with rabbits printed on them! Ehe. So as you do he said ehe right. But it actually had been raining paint and chocolate rabbits! Mmm! Then I was thinking about how it would kind of hurt if it was raining slabs of chocolate! Hehe. Analyse that! (I'm sure I spelt analalallalalayse wrong but what the whooo!) Every one says what the hey. I'm gonna go now cause I scare myself!
