EVERYONE IS GONE. oh well. i put up this away message that says, "can you still feel the butterflies?" and underneat that, "p.s. i love you, forever and today." and all these people IM me like, "soo... who's the lucky boy? when did you start dating?" and i'm like, "i'm not dating anyone... i wish. those are lyrics." and then it makes me sad that i have no boy to hug and call my own. such a girl, aren't i?
