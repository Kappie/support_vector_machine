It was the fact that we missed by two questions, and that we could've salvaged two points, possibly, from dumb answers. Rachel Carson did  not  write "The Rite of Spring." Damnit. It was just so close...we were leading at one point and I looked to our proctor Nora and wanted her to call time.   But maybe the thing that bothers me most is the fact that on the winning team, there was this Asian girl. Chinese, I assume. Not only did she know quite a few answers (though not all), she had a Louis Vuitton purse, and a Kate Spade necklace and bracelet. She seemed to be having a good time. Of course she had a good time. She knew that Othello's wife was named Donatella. Winning question. I probably gazed upon that name once...I read summaries of Shakespeare in sixth grade, but my memory has failed me. (It might also help to include that her teammate is this Saudi kid who goes to Andover...he's in the Design seminars too. Rich kids.)  She's Chinese, most likely a rising senior, and has it all, on a very basic level: intelligence, material goods and seems bathe in social comfort.  Maybe the material part irks me the most, since I haughtily deem myself at least satisfactory in the other two categories.  Would Mom let me walk around like that? Spend that kind of money? Would  I let myself spend that kind of money?  I've always felt guilty browsing through websites of clothing retailers. It just seems too petty and shallow of me. So I do it, but I always close the page by the time someone gets around. By extension, I don't like to part with much money on one particular thing, though it leads to spending a little on a lot of things. Somehow that is more acceptable to my conscience.  Now that I write this all down, it seems even pettier. I shouldn't really care. Besides, I'm going shopping with Wendy Sunday. And what could be better than that? A friend in town, and a need to satisfy.  Yeah, I'm happy with the way I am. Really.
