You dirty minded fiend. I'm talking about wishing. Yeah I wish. I wish a lot. I wish on falling stars, on necklace chains that need to be spun, I even wish on the time of day. Well specifically 11:11, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33 ( i think you get double for that one because there's 3 threes), 4:44, 5:55 and I also wish at 2:17 my birthday. I don't know if they ever come true but a few have. But wishing isn't all that nuts is it? I mean we've been wishing on birthday candles for centuries. There's been wishing wells since forever. But why? Wishing gives us hope in things happening by pure luck or just pure faith that they will. Wishing can be fun. So, just for me, wish once today.
