And I  do  need to do a foundation course because that if how you build up a decent portfolio and please stop trying to tell me I'm wrong. I am quite happy with the way I am handling it, I have spoken to my art teacher and she actually said do the foundation course because you get to experience new arts and stuff.  If you say any more about it without me asking you do you know this or do you know that I'm gonna get really annoyed even though I already am quite annoyed because I don't appreciate people telling me me own ideas especially when you don't even want to do fashion design or something along those lines I think I would know a little more about the fashion courses. Sorry if that sounds rude but this term I am very pissed off at people copying my ideas and trying to tell me what to do. I am my own person you know. I can do stuff myself without people telling me or then copying me.
