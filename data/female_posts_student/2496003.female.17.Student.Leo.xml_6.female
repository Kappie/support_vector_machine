Without them, I really don't get to see my femme friends (although Juice and Java the other night was tres fantastique), which is pathetic. Since when do we need guys to define our friendships? And on that note, since when do we need guys to define ANY part of our lives? I guess I'm more or less just venting because suddenly I'm having guy problems. No, not problems, just one problem, and his name is Andy. And the answer to this problem is so incredibly simple, that when I found it, it slapped me upside the head and told me I was a dumbass. "Never let someone be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option." Wise words from my sister's profile. Not like Andy was top priority or anything [that will forever be myself and my mommy], but I was putting too much emphasis on him without getting anything back. And besides that, I do believe he just successfully phased me out. It doesn't really hurt all that much, seeing as I actually figured it out, unlike poor Sean, who probably is still wondering why I never answer my cell phone. Phased out and single. It just seems like a waste of like three weeks of my life, you know? But anyway, there are much better things to talk about.    I missed just having my femmes with me. Which is why I think my slumber party is going to be an all-girls thing, maybe I'll still have a birthday party with the guys, but right now I think I want to focus more on the people I really truly love and care about, and that's my girl friends. We've gotten so crazily close this summer ... what's going to happen when we all go our separate ways? I'm on the verge of tears just thinking about it, because the possibility of us all drifting apart just scares me. I realize that I'm supposed to make new friends at college, but damnit, I'm not at college 365 days a year, and I like the friends I have now. Besides ... we all know how I feel about other girls, ha!    On my final note of the evening ... it's about damn time, Kirby.    I love you all, some more than others, but still for all,  Your Sweetest  b .
