But these superficial judgements on behavior, and on appearance hide a certain problem, for the individual, which is that the individual lives from inside, not outside. And in the search for company, people are apt to comply with other people, mimic, imitate, or use artifice to convince another person or group of people, to believe they are genteel, and well meaning, that they attract by subterfuge is the morally ambiguous part.   Now and then I start to realize how self- centered my ambitions are, but self-centered doesn't necessarily mean that they come from a genuine motive. Ambitions seem to be from the outside, the perception of what we need to accomplish in order to deserve love, money, and respect. :  I am in a zone now, but I am remembering what it was like to spend money not for enjoyment of spending, but for enjoyment itself. I don't think I have captured an image of what I am like inside, but my writing especially in a grazzy shady place beneath a well leaved tree, a graceful and perfectly shaped tree, at that. I am pleased, an exact place, and I just relax. Then I am aware of how tense I become around other people, when I start to become suspicious of them, and I am not interested in being looked at or judged.   Exoskeletons, and all that, I enjoy reading when I am alone, not when people bother me, or insist on attracting attention, but I see the enjoyment of other people as a genuine benefit of being in public, I really enjoyed it, but to relax, I need space, grass, and comfort.  I found a good poetry contest, I will pursue it, for a moment. I may make some contacts, that way. I am a poet without a direction, what shall I do to attract more attention?
