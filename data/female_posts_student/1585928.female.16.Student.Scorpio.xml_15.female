I have no idea why I started thinking about him, but I've had Justin on my mind alll day!! weird huh?, I guess it is because it is his B-Day!! * HaPpY BiRtHdAy JuStIn!* but anyway... There is totally NOTHING there AT ALL!!.. I'm happy with everything goin on right now with a certain someone!!! hehe.. but I just thought about all the memories we had together, all the stuff we went through, him being there for me through anything and everything! I will always *MISS*: the ^MANYYY^ hours we spent on the phone, always watching football together, all the Jokes we had, I will miss him callin me *SuNsHiNe*, I will miss him.. calling me ENTIRELY TOOOO early in the morning just to tell me he was thinking about me and loved me!, I will miss his truck(hehe), I will miss watchin 'Trading Spaces' and 'While you were Out' EvErY Saturday together!, I will miss him calling me to tell me our song was on!, I will miss him always askin me 'how the "dog" is doing?', I will miss his hugs and kisses, and sooo many more thing about him! But, even though we have gone our separate ways, which I know is for the best, He will always mean a lot to me, and he knows that! I honestly wish the best for him!, I'll always remember him and all the times we had together, they are just things I could never forget!! ... Although I wish in a way I had never dated him because of our *aWeSoMe* friendship that we no longer have, I wouldn't have changed a thing!, I learned sOoOoO much from dating him so long!, but its all good!! I just felt like gettin all that out!! hehe!! well David is calling!! so I'm gone!! byeee!
