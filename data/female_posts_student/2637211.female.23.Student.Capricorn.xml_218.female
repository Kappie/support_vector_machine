Next I'm going home to Oakland, and I'm going to write up my paper on colonialism over the weekend. I'm kind of into it, so I'll probably begin it earlier than Sunday, the due date. I was going to take a shower, but Lisa beat me to it, and it's probably for the best, since she's been working so hard yesterday and today getting sweaty (I'm just teasing, Lisa). I'll probably get a shower at home in a few hours.   I'm guessing everyone's really busy with finals and doesn't have time to comment on my graduation clothes quandary. Maybe later.
