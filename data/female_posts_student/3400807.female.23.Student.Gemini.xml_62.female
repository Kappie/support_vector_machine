So... I sent  urlLink that letter  to Alicia the same day I wrote it, but I haven't heard anything back. I don't know if I will. I guess I was being a little overly optimistic in expecting some sort of quick response... It's very disappointing. And, to tell the truth, it kind of hurts. I'm relatively sure she checks her e-mail daily. But, for all I know, she's gotten swamped with work and school  (she should be graduating soon! The only one in our group who had no intention of going to college if she could at all avoid it and she's going to be the first to get a degree. How ironic is  that !)  or life in general and just hasn't gotten it yet. Patience has never been one of my virtues. I guess I'll just wait and see.
