I want to be loved like never before  No more lying, no more crying  I don't want to be hurt anymore  I just want to be loved...   What's wrong with me?  Am I really that ugly?  Am I a whore or a bitch  or any of the other things he said?  Am I just not good enough?   I want to be loved like never before  No more lying, no more crying  I don't want to hurt anymore  I just want to be loved...   Maybe if I wear more makeup...  Maybe if I lose more weight...  Maybe if I just wear less...  Maybe he'll want me back...  Maybe...Someday...He'll love me again   I just want to be lovedâ€¦
