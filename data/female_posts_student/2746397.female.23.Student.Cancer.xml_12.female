We travelled by train to the holy city of Hardwar. There was a huge festival for the god Shiva going on there. People were making their way there, taking water from the Gonga river (the Ganges), putting it in an ornamented carrying 'thing' and then walking it to Delhi (a three day journey, though some cheated and took the train). So the town was full of craziness. We saw a type of fire worship, got mobbed after, i dipped my feet in the Gonga, got rained on monsoon style, ate at a host of different restaurants, saw a lot of white people seeking a lost sort of peace, went to a whole bunch of hindu temples, and stayed at a hotel made of marble. Pretty intense. We spent three days up there, most of which was spent in prayer. I would encourage you tothink of that area of the world.  On our way home from Hardwar i got hot soup dumped on me, i then had to change my clothes in an Indian style train washroom. Ask me about that when i get back.  Yesterday we went to the city of Agra, which hosts the Taj Mahal, and it is indeed just as cool as the pictures. Well actually it was very,very hot. We all got a sunburn and sweated like it was going out of style. There were lots of pictures taken, something to look forward to... We also saw the Agra Fort, which at one point held the guy who had the Taj built. Its a long story, I'm sure you can find it here on the net somewhere.  We leave today for the north. It is a 24 hour train ride, which will no doubt be a story to share when we get back. We have been told that it is quite wet up there and we are not too sure what to expect.  Dad emailed me all of the comments you have left for me. Thanks! I miss all of you a lot.  Take care, and happy belated wedding, happy wedding day tomorrow, and happy birthday.  Oh, and ek do teen ood means - one, two, three, camel...we saw camels, water buffalo, an elephant and a LOT of cows.  Love, love and more love,  Laura
