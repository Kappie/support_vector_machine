I later went to go get a haircut (and it turned out aight for once, haha), and then came home to pick up dad and go to the Y, where I had a great workout.  :-)  after i got home, dad and bo left for bo's baseball practice, and i stayed home with mom.  i cooked dinner all by myself!  and didnt' screw up!!  haha, anyone who knows me well at all knows i can't cook worth a flip..but that all changed today!  and i even made dessert!  sure they were slice-and-bake pillsburys, but who cares?  at least i didn't burn them to a crisp this time.  oh goodness, i can be quite the spaz.  but hey, it's all good.  and after dinner, i went up and played guitar for a while until i decided to call jordan, which of course he's never home, he's got a life unlike his best friend, lol.  so i didn't get to talk to him, but i called meg soon after, which is always cool.  haha, she and i could talk for like centuries.  but anyway, i'm gonna get off here...there's a certain guy i need to go spend some time with, just me and Him.  :-D  Later  >  Draw me close to You Never let me go I lay it all down again.  To hear you say that im your friend.  You are my desire.  No one else will do.  Cause no one else can take the place.  To fill the warmth of your embrace.  Help me find a way.  To bring me back to you. You're all i want. You're all i've ever needed You're all i want. Help me know you are near.     P.S. Sorry, Tyler B....I've been there, dude.  :-/
