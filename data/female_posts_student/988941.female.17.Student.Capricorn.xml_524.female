Other than that I've been relaxing in the garden, now a small matter of exams is out of the way (well, apart from that thing called IT that I really don't intend to revise for!). Got quite a busy week planned, what with heart scans, day trips, revision classes and birthday parties all in the mix, but I'm looking forward to it because I only have to step onto the school premises for one occasion next week, and that would be the thing they call  IT, yet again. But gtg dry my hair now, and hope it hasn't turned green, cos it sure smells mighty funny at this moment in time. Toodles peeps
