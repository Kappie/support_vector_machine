Monday: absolutely nothing, i finished the second and third Harry Potter books and then i watched Miracle for like the millionth time this summer....i bet i can recite that movie now  Tuesday (which is today):  First i went to work but then i went home early because the kid i babysit went to a swim party thingie.  I got halfway through the 4th Harry Potter book....looks like i'll finish all 5 before thursday at this rate!  Then Kendra called and wanted to know if i wanted to go to the mall with her and Nadia, of course i said yes! We had fun there and then we went to Nadia's house to chill.  I watched a movie that Stewie and Nadia made about y2k....they were so little and so cute!  Then we decided to make a movie about what happened after y2k if it really happened!!!  It was awesome.  Me and Nadia played ourselves in '99 (with Spice Girls playing in the background of course) and we were freaking out about our Windows 98 not working after the clock struck midnight.  Kendra was the Microsoft computer nerd telling us we were all going to die.  She also played the Chinese freaking out about y2k and calling President Clinton about it (you have to remember that this is in 1999 and he was still president).  I guess our movie was very politically incorrect lol.  So it was basically a movie where me and Nadia were trying to get Windows XP so our computer wouldn't die and the world would be saved.....Best Buy had run out (where i did my screaming and wailing about how Kendra the computer nerd needs to give me Windows XP) so we decided to break into Bill Gates' house and steal Windows XP.  We used the priceless Ask Jeeves thing (courtesy of Broken Crayons' The Potato) where we asked it "How do i hack into Bill Gates' house to get Windows XP" or something like that.  I made up the Mission Impossible theme music!  Well we didn't succeed and the world ended, it was an awesome movie.  So after Nadia took me home, i read some more Harry Potter and then Stewie/Nadia called me asking me for ideas to cure their boredom.  I decided that we should all go for a sonic run! We did, we ate and we talked.  It was alot of fun! I almost went over to Stewie's house for the night, but my dad said i couldn't because he didn't want to pick me up at 8am (stewie had ballet).  So we made plans for tomorrow night instead!  it'll be tons of fun i'm sure.    Jessi- i got your messages!!!  i know, i haven't seen you all summer and i miss you sooooooo much!!! Where the heck did you go!?!!  anyways, we have to hang out soon!  alright, and i'm up to read some more and then sleep or something like that.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
