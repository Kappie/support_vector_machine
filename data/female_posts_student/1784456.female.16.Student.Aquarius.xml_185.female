Lets all sit around and listen to really crappy music while all the tarts and bimbos dance with popular people that they pretend to fancy - FOR JIM'S SAKE! Sorry but it's my idea of complete boredom. We should have an online disco and invite a load of people and pretend to be listening to good music, yeah!!! Kinda sad how the only socialising we do is on the net. I guess the only interesting people you meet are on the net because Nailsea is so BORING!!! Our year group is really crap. Ahhhh fun times. Ok, I'll shut up now.
