After all, it is their daughter; they brought her into this world and parents never want to see their children die before they do. However, why would you let one of your loved ones suffer in a vegetative state? Her husband has been trying to end her life by having her tubes removed. The whole idea that the Governor intervened struck a nerve with me. It was not in his place to decide a person's life. Leave that to the family to decide. Her husband has been trying to move on with his life, but there are setbacks. She apparently told her husband before her accident that she would never want to live a life as a vegetable, and I could understand that. I personally would not want to continue living if I or a family member was brain dead and could no longer communicate. The person is physically there, but what is the point of having them around if they cannot serve any other purpose? It is extremely expensive to keep a person living off artifical means as well as keeping an individual like Terri alive. I have already mentioned to friends and family that I wouldn't want to leave off artificial means or allow me to live my life as a vegetable.
