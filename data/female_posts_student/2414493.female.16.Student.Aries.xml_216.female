Sometimes I just want to quit, but then I remember that the curve is generous and that I've already paid for this test so I might as well take it. I'll be fine. I think I'm halfway through the review and a lot of the material ahead is some of the stuff I either absorbed at YSP or did in physio. I hope it will be fine, really. And I realize I need to study for history, too.  I still haven't gotten a test site for the June SATIIs. It worries me, in a pathetic, academically-obsessed kind of way. I don't approve, but I still need to test math before time runs out.   But seriously now, can I be an academic jerk and have everyone else leave me alone? I'll do what I need to do according to my standards; I don't want to be a normal student, thank you. So what if I prefer to study? Do well on tests? I'll regulate my life, they'll regulate theirs if they're wise. I'm not trying to live by Asian stereotypes here. It's what I want out of myself. It's not any more Asian of me than the next white guy who also prefers to do well. It's just stupid how...well, it's just stupid. I just ran out of brain juice. It's AP week, and I'm not a happy camper.  My sunburn itches.
