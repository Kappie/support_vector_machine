"oh you remember my son, william.. he has the  third-highest  average in his class." somehow doesnt have the same ring.  and apparently PING PONG is now an olympics sport. i guess the politically correct term is "table tennis." now, my aunt used to be something of a legend in terms of ping pong.. enough trophies to make your head spin. so dad goes "ha! ping pong! china is going to win every trophy! china is ping pong king." i guess its one of those "you had to be there" things, but.. i tell you i thought i would cough my lungs up, i was laughing so hard.  its just the sheer "its impossible for anyone else to win" opinion of my dad. like the one time when i saw something about a math competition in  the toronto star , i go to my dad "there was a math competition yesterday, and no chinese people ranked in the first three positions." my dad just shot me a knowing smile over his daily cup of java and whispered "youre lying. i do not  believe ."  ooh boy. i think i will be having hell if i dont make something useful of myself. it has already begun.. the beginning of the end. my cousin is going to  mcmaster  this fall. i have four cousins in california.. one has recently become an optometrist, and another is getting his phd in biomedical engineering and is helping to conduct clinical trials on a biologically-based electrode that could quite possibly make him a very rich man. a third one is studying computer engineering, and the fourth one is already a mini-genius in the making.  sometimes its almost overwhelming, in fact. im surrounded by brilliant intelligence, by dazzling creativity, by near perfection. my family, mostly, and occasionally my friends. sometimes i step back and think "what the hell am i doing among these people?" i feel almost sinfully inadequate. im just a simple, simple person with attainable aspirations. im not looking into where ill be ten years from now. im taking it one step at a time.. first this year of high school, then the next, then university. it seems oh so far away.  its not that im some sort of slob who has no idea where her life is going. its just that, at this point in my life, i dont  care . im satisfied with knowing that my average is steady and high enough to please myself. but i think if anything motivates me, its my parents. when my cousin told us that she had been accepted by  mcmaster , my dad squeezed my hand and whispered "dont worry, pumpkin. you will have your turn in two years. and when it comes, i think you will surprise even  yourself ."  how do i answer to that? its not a heavy pressure, its not like theyre forcing me to do anything i dont want to. its more like a quiet assurance.. like they know that it will happen. not "if," but "when." its the sort of pressure you cant argue with, like telling a kid who  knows  hell get a certain toy that his parents cant afford it. i just hope that, when all of this really matters, i will be good enough to have measured up.  - L.
