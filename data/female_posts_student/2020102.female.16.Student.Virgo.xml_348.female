Nate: It says in the history book that it was Pythagoras.  Ms. Maas: I know what it says, and it's wrong. Rachelle: Well today in history we learned that it was actually the ancient Indians who made it. Jake: Well, my mom says that SHE invented the Pythagorean Theorem...  "They were talking about premies and then they were talking about dogs, but I didn't realize they had changed topics so it really freaked me out when they were like 'then we had it at home, and it was vomiting and peeing in its kennel.'" -Alex overhearing some teachers before Prayer Club  Austin: Your lifeline is really long.  Fharon: Really?  Austin: No. Gimme your hand. (looks at Fharon's palm) Well, this line means... you have a crease in your hand...   "Have you ever seen that movie where the guy says a word and then he goes, 'bla bla. To bla bla bla.' Yeah. It was really funny. It'd be even funnier if I could remember it." -Brandy  Tessa: You should have someone play the jingle bells. (pause) Mr. Snell: Jingle bells... jingle bells... jingle all the way... Tessa: No, like the actual jingle bells. Mr. Snell: They're called "sleigh bells." Jingle bells are the little tiny ones that go "jingle jingle." Tracy: The sleigh bells go "sleigh, sleigh."  Sarah: The hall pass lady's name is Mrs. Nelson. Melanie: Wow, she DOES have a name! And it's even somewhat normal, too. Erin: Yeah, but her first name is Galockchuck.  Erin: Do I look like Heidi? Sarah: I don't know who that is. Erin: You know, that girl that like runs through the hills. Sarah: Oh, and that lives in the Alps or whatever, with the braids. Malorie: Oh I know her, she goes to my church.  (Grading each other's papers in English) Ryan S.: Cursive is really hard to read. Micaela: Sorry, I have bad handwriting. Ryan S.: No, I just can't read it very well. Brandon: Yeah, it's even harder when you're trying to cheat on her on a stupid vocab quiz.  Erin: I’m LISTENING! Sarah: To what? Erin: Whatever you just said!  (at Chik-fil-a) Sarah: What’s that one sandwich that comes in a bag? Erin: That would be a number 1. Sarah: I want that. (pause) But the picture has yucky pickles. (long pause while Erin looks at me like I'm the biggest moron on the planet) Erin: Then tell them “no” on the yucky pickles.  (talking about a science project) Erin: Have you done the animal thing yet? Sarah: No. Erin: Me neither. Sarah: I’m doing ring-tailed lemurs… they’re so cute. Erin: I think they’re weird looking, their eyes are like huge. Sarah: They have ring tails. Erin: No, I thought they were called ring tailed lemurs because they had polka dotted heads.  (talking about the Grand Canyon) Dad: It’s about 25 or 30 degrees hotter at the bottom. Mom: Really? I thought it was cooler at the top.  Mr. Moon: What can you get from sheep? Ryan S.: Milk. Mr. Moon: Wool. Ryan S.: Okay… (a while later) Ryan S.: Can’t you get milk from sheeps?  I imagine that many of these are a lot more entertaining to me than they are to whoever may be reading this, but, well, I guess you'll just have to get over it. :p
