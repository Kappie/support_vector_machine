Ah!  Nice job guys.  Canada show next.  Pull some good shit out for them, eh!  News on the Cubbie front--Way to go!  We needed the win tonight.  Glad you boys got it done.  Let's take care of Houston and get ready to sweep up the White Sox this weekend.  I know it can be done, even though my bro doesnt think so.  He is a Cubs fan by the way, but he has this theory that the Cubs cant beat the White Sox.  I think hes high on crack.  Oh well.    Seems as though Sod got an email from tCj and Ive heard....nothing.  So anyone care to give me a second place prize, Im willing to negotiate.    Oh, class was marvelous.  NO eye CONTACT! .......bs.  I thought I had more to ramble on about, but it looks like Im still the same old boring lady.  Except the fact that I have no idea what I will do if some little punk kid tries to start a fight with my son.    NEWS Headlines that eerie day.   Mom In Park Ties Little Punk Kid To The Top of The Slide and Treats Him Like a pinata.    peace.love.dmb
