Had PD first... that was okay kinda boring. Next was SAC and i did  nothing  contructive but i learnt about footnotes and Greenie told me about his daughter -- whoa interesting... Love those footnotes. However the worst was yet to come -- i intensely  hate  maths!!! Its always so  noisy  and we get nothing done... plus it is  extremely boring ! But the crappest thing ever. i was sitting there infront of E block like we always do at lunch, and i was trying to be all stealthy and talk on my phone, lol, anyway Obi walked past and said something about me not handing in an essay for extension and i was like "oh yeh boo hhoo sir i just had a really crappy night and didnt get around to it" AND then he said  "I don't wanna hear about neil problems"  i was like WTF?!? ugh so  uncalled for . Then i had to walk around and try to get a bunch of fotos off teachers and they all wanted to  talk  and i just wanted to go to sleep..... i was just in that mood where i was all head-achy and didnt feel like talking and they just kept being all chatty about scarves and artworks and other irrelevant stuff.... which could have been possibly interesting if i was in a sociable mood.      but now i can't sleep. :(      And it's so annoying that we don't get our jerseys until the 6th of August!!! That is pathetic! I know its  not  the committee's fault - it's the stupid company. Guh, rude! OH well if i wake up soon enough tonight should be fun. no idea what is planned but involved going to maris' and then something. who knows?      Yeah  Jenno , i read your blog. I can't not be friends with you, its ok now. Anyway i suppose this marks the end of my blog for today. Hope you all have a good afternoon/night. ;)      See you, bye!
