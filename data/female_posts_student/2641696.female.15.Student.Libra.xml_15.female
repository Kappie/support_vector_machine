You can be calm and soothing one minute and raging in anger the next so no one wants to get on your bad side. Your beauty is inspiring and magical.     urlLink   find your element - (girls only)     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla      I think that's pretty reasonable. And it's nice to think my beauty is inspiring and magical. And that no body wants to get on my bad side =D   Among other things, I'm happy. Heh. FFX is absolutely beautiful (my parents are wonderful and finally bought it for me :p); I saw the sending movie part and that was just stunning. I was in shock afterwards. The only thing that bothers me is that I can only save at save-spheres, which is just friggin  annoying . Also the battle system is kinda stupid; not exciting at all, what with the turns. But then again, I can't come up with a better idea, so who am I to judge.   But FFX isn't the only reason I'm happy :) Unfortunately I can't really reveal why I'm so happy here muahaha, just to make everyone get angry at me =D (be forewarned, I am Wind, hear my roar!)   This is also very strange, since for all of you who aren't in my sci. class and didn't witness my total breakdown... well, suffice to say, I'm not a genius. lol. I'm sure you all knew that already, but for me it's kinda disappointing =D =D =D *cracks up* Egotistical maniac! woo!   Thanks P and B for being so nice :) Honestly, I just have the coolest damn friends. Couldn't be happier. Must be a good neighborhood or something :p
