But I refuse to vent - other than the above - cause this is my sixtieth entry!  I'm very, very proud of myself.  I didn't even think I'd write in this more than three times, but I ended writing twenty times that!  Ok, that's what I said yesterday, when I wrote all that stuff and needed to just yell at something.  Now, I'm better.  Rooney's playin on the radio, and how can you not mellow out a bit to the tunes of "Blueside?"  Not much has changed as far as anger, except I'm a bit less angry with my mom, more angry at my friends (mostly my best friends), and most angry with my teachers.  But I'm not gonna focus on that, or the mounting loads of work in newspaper and yearbook.  I'm gonna focus on the things all stereotypical blondes use to cheer themselves up: boys and hair.  Since there isn't anyone in particular on the crush horizon (hot boys yes, anyone in particular, no), I'll just focus on my hair.  I borrowed this lady's shampoo and conditioner, and my hair's never been so shiny.  It's that sheer blonde stuff from John Freida, that supposedly removes all the pollutants and stuff that darkens your hair.  My hair's not lighter, but it sure is glossy.  As Emily would say, it's "Mallory hair" (she has really, really perfect hair that's always shiny).  I think I might actually wear it down, a rarity seen by few outside of yearbook camp and the pool.  Oh, congrats to Emily (while I'm on the subject) for having Mallory hair too!  She got it straightened, and it really looks great.  If my hair weren't stick straight, I'd get that permanent straightening done myself, just to have hair that shiny. Speaking of the pool, I have a new person to add to the anger list - my sister.  It all started with another of her BRILLIANT plans (that's sarcasm sweetie) - let's go to the pool!  Guess who's a lifeguard this year?  Shaheen's beloved Zachary (Zach).  I have nothing against him, but he's definitely near the top of the list of people I don't want to see me swimming.  Why? 1). I'm no Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue model; 2). I'm a slow swimmer...I can hold my own at the beach and stuff, but I will lose to anyone who challenges me to swim who's above the age of eight and can swim; and 3). I never gave up playing all those pool games, like marco polo, categories, diving for pennies, alligator, shark, the color game, tunnel tag, drain tag, and all those good pasttimes.  So, I'm not crazy about the idea of him looking at me at the pool.  The boy has, like, -5% body fat, and I have, well, more than that.  It could be worse, at least numbers one, two and three don't go to CRA.  I hope to God they don't.  Don't get inspired to come, either!   Well I need to study for my Math Analysis test.  For those who have read this at least once, you know I just want to give my undivided attention to the ppl I'm talkin to right now.  Later.
