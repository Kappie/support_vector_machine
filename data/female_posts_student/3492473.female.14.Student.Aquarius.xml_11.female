I've been holding out on telling you guys what's been bugging me because the last time I wrote about Chris and me in here,  he flipped out . When he found out I put our convo in here, it wasn't good. That night we had a big fight and he said some pretty mean things that I would have never expected him to say.  Ever.  And I'm just so sick of hiding this from you guys that I'm just gonna tell you. And if Chris gets even more mad at me, so be it. He can't hurt me much more than he already did. People say kids don't know what true love is but whatever I felt, I considered it love. I loved Chris more than any other guy I've ever dated, more than any other person I ever liked, or ever wanted to date. Together, we had so many good times, jokes, and fun. And now... now it's all gone.  Now every time our song comes on the radio, I just wanna cry. I listen to the lyrics and think of how true they really were.   Hoobastank -- "The Reason"  I'm not a perfect person There are many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new  and the reason is you   It seems like now that we're broken up, our song is on the radio a lot more. It's almost like the radio station knows that I want to hear it but then I don't. Every time I go to call someone a jackass now, I stop. Because I called Chris a jackass and it was one of those "us" things. Every time we hang out, I have to stop myself from going up to him and hugging him or holding his hand. Because  things aren't like that anymore . Every time I think about everything he said to me, I get upset. It's like he  never  meant it.  Any of it.  Every time I think about one of my friends saying, "I can never see you two breaking up...you're like the  perfect  couple," I think about how I believed them. And every time I go back and listen to the promises he made, I just wanna cry. Because  he didn't keep them . It's hard living with a broken heart and I am trying my best. I don't like dwelling in the past but I don't have much hope in the future so it keeps me in the past. I never thought he'd be one of those boys to break my heart,  but I guess I was wrong.
