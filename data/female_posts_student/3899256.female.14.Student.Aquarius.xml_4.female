This is going to sound really retarded (but look who's typing it) but i'm addicted to spiderman.  I saw Spiderman 2 and i was hooked to the point that i want to play the videogame  all day then watch the movies, then go to the Spiderman website...and the people that i have to thank are Katey, Ashley and Abbi.  Band starts tomorrow...YAY (not really).  Its going to be so depressing and weird to go to band and not be able to see mr. barr there.  not to mention the fact that i still don't have much of my music memorized...oops.  Well i'm gonna go for now.  I'll write more tomorrow about the first day of band...*in sarcastic tone* I cant wait.   *caitlin*
