WORD OF THE DAY --> Shoe.    yeah, justone.we can do a lot of things with a shoe...*thinks*..u can steal sand from the beach, u can throw it to someone's head...u can use it to kill someone if u have a bad smell on ur feet by putting the shoe really near that person's nose...!!i only use shoes to attack people...uh...ok, i also use them on my feetah ah ah, i'm amused thinkin what i'm able to do with both a shoe and a person which i don't like next to me...ah ah ah i'm malefic, as my brother says...!!and i'm sostupid 2...but that's another story.       ***  take care  ***
