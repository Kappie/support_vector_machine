I met Nick's future daycare family today. I am so nervous. My stomach is all twisted up in knots. They have 6-8 kids and there will be another child Nick's age and one other that is almost 1 year old. Plus older kids that are pre-school age. I don't know...that seems like a lot of kids to me. I can't imagine another Nick to watch at the same time. Hummmm. Can I just quit school and stay at home for the rest of my life and never leave Nick's side...ever...I don't think Shawn will go for that! ;) I like Kelly a lot. That is his future daycare-mom. It's probably a good thing for Nick to interact with kids. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I don't know how I am going to drop Nick off and walk away....I'll probably end up in tears the first 2 weeks I leave...who am I kidding....the first year! Nick will probably love it there and be just fine. I love Nick so much. He's my Nicky-pie.  urlLink
