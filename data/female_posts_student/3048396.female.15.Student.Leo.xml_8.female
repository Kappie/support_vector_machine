Frist off my Grandpa Frick..he has something wrong with his neck..might have to have surgery...he is always cold and doctors dont know why and they found a spot of cancer in him...*sigh*...then today they found out the my Grandma Frick...has a hole in her eye. Doctors don't have a clue how she got it...just last week she noticed her eye was all blury...so she probably will have surgery this Thursday over in Sioux Falls. *sigh*...Then onto me. Somethins up with me again I woke up and my heart was racing extreamly fast...and I couldnt breathe all to well...Well later on I could breathe better I just couldnt take deep breaths. I went to my aunts and had her check me out. She said my heart rate was above normal but my lungs seem alright. *sigh* We're all just falling apart. *sigh* Not much else to talk about except that thingy we went to today. I actually got something out of it...lol Might sound odd...but it actually made me think and make some new desisons...So yeah...blah...thats all for now....  -Tara
