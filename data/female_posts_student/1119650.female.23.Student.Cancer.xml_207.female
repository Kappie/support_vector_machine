I was in someone's driveway and this little  urlLink Jack Russell Terrier  (or parsons terrier for those of you up on your terrier facts) who was black and white came running over to me.  I looked at my friend who I was with and said "We have to keep him."   "What should we name him?" my friend asked. Simultaneously we look at each other and say "Black Jack" and with that, the black patch over his eye changed into the shape of a  urlLink spade .  Now I'm on a mission in real life...I must find a Jack Russell or a  urlLink Rat Terrier  that is black and white and I shall call him or her "BlackJack" or Jackie for short (blackie just seems too racist).  Anyhow, I tell my friend to take the dog to the car so I can go use the facilities and when I open the womens room door I end up in my old boyfriends  urlLink UConn  dorm room.  He and my other good friend, PJ, are in there and we start hanging out like old times.  I'm laughing cause PJ, a guy, is wearing this ridiculous bright red lipstick and I tell him to leave a fake love note to his roomate, Shane.   We all chuckle and they pass me a candy bowl.  I grab a fistful of candy and start crunching away on it.  I ask what they are as they taste so yummy and they tell me  urlLink shrooms , because they wanted to trip with me again in hopes that we might 'get stuck outside of time' again.  (See kids, drugs are bad mmm'kay?)  I start tripping and rummaging through their room and I find my old pink feather boa that I used to wear all around the halls on drinking nights.  I put it on and we just veg out and enjoy the trip.    All of a sudden I see PJ trying to hump my foot, and ask him what the hell he's doing and he says my foot has a magnet to his junk.  It was very wierd.  Anyhow I need to go the bathroom still so I go to leave and I open the door and step into an episode of the powerpuff girls.  I, of course, am  urlLink Bubbles  and I walk throgh the house which is a giant tiled swimming pool and I walk in on the  urlLink Professor  and  urlLink Sedusa  taking a bath in the jacuzzi.  They yelled at me and I woke up when my alarm went off to my  urlLink Z-100 ZMorning Zoo Horoscope .    I need to stop taking this goddamned Paxil I think its making me  MORE  crazy, if thats possible.
