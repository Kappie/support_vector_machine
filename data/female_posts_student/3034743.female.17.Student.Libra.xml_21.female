Oh well. When I got home, Omondo came over for a bit. I played her song for her. Gigolo! Oh yeah. We just went over my list of the greatest 80s songs...well, my personal choices at least.  Keep on Loving You  by REO Speedwagon is a good song. Me and Omondo danced to it! Oh yeah! I have to memorize these sentences for spanish class, and it sucks. I can memorize them easily, but its taking the time to concentrate that is getting me stuck. Oh well....I should stop blogging and start memorizing! Side note: Anyone who doesn't think Steve Martin is one of the funniest fellows on the planet should have his head examined! (oh yeah, Chubbs, I'm good!)
