You can't even begin to think what it's like. No one can know everything about some one because they might not tell you stuff. So you may be reading this and seeing a different side to me than I see and every one else does. We all have different layers, some times we show more than we would want to. (No gross thoughts ok?) So think about it! Grrr...stupid msn...*cough* Any way, umm, ok Izzy, I'll try to go on geocities!
