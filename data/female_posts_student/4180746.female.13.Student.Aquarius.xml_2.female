Are u really the person who ive been thinkin about for the past 1 year? No So you have no right whatsoever to knwo about my personal matters. Do i sound too rude?oh sorry i didnt realise it hurts you too much. Cus arent u that air headed doll those guys like? Or that chotey kapron waalee who the bmw waalas want on their arm? Hanging...or should i say acting like the typical whore? But then thats ok right?as long as they like u *sigh* U= Swan......ME=Ugly duckling. Does it matter? Yes Do i care ? Yes Why? Cus brains arent everything. I know what theyll say. Brains are what matter. But if given a hoice who would they take? the 5"5 slender swan or the 5"2 ugly duckling? The swan ofcourse. Hypocrisy is the essense of this society. And no one can change that Maybe i dont want it to change, But then i do, I hope it does Cus id love to see the day when brains matter more to those BMW waalas than beauty.
