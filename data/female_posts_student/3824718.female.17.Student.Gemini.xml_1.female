(atleast not yet)And of course he is being really sweet. i don't know wether its because he knows im not happy or because he is finally over this jealous asshole faze. either way im totally confused. anyways...i went over to eric's last night and we watched a ben stiller movie marathon and i showed him some tape of roger federer ( HOTTIE ). he deffinatly thinks roger is hot cuz he was like salivating the whole time. anywho we just hung out and it was kinda relaxing and then sharon made us hot cocoa and i fell asleep. Anyways this morning we went for a run and then slept some more. i came home and i had 8 missed calls. 2 from allie and the rest from jesse and mom said he called the house alot too. So i guess i should call him back but i don't feel like it yet. Me and eric talked alot about it and i had forgotten how easy he was to talk to about everything so he was really helpful. Now i have ->CC-> camp this week and softball camp next week. Dad has me throwing 600 pitches monday wednesday and friday and 300 tuesday and thursday so im gunna be really tired. Coach Ellington already told us that for CC monday we are running 18 hills 12 400's and 2 miles so its not gunna be fun. he'll probably throw ome stadiums in there 2 if someone doesn't barf before practice is over. anyhow im just not too happy so im gunna go   ~>check out Eye Of The Storm By Blindside
