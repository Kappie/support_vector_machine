(ALERT: ppl goin to kwantan wif her, remember to wake her an hour be4 the assembling time! :P jking)haha... my frenz always make me smile wifout fail. haha. ms junaidah's wedding was interesting as this was the first time tt i had atteneded a malay wedding. she was sitting on a beautifully decorated chair, dressed in a dark blue baju kurong with flowers skillfully sewn onto it. (sori guys, too tired to think of adjectives to describe.. hehe.. so juz bear wif my horrible english). the ceremony was great too, witnessing the bridegroom fishing out a few cheques be4 the bride's maid actually let him to see her face. i still can't forget his smile when he finally got to see her enchanting face. he's smile was filled wif contentment, happiness, assurance n many more expressions which showed a promising marriage. haha.. feel so happy for them. ^_^   after the delicious meal, van van, qh, desmond n i went to orchard 2gether to see wat's street festival all abt. it was pretty interesting as we seldom see ppl dressing in manga characters (mostly from jap comics). haha... it feels as if i was in japan. hehe... we ate long john at cine n took some quite neoprints. haha. qh n desmond always have their own interesting way of posing in front of the camera while evan n i showed our artistic flare on the neoprint by decorating it. hehe... really enjoyed myself today, all thanks to u guys. gosh.. so tired... talking incoherently... better stop writing... God bless everyone...   ~We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth wihtout creating it...~    ::if u can dream, do not make dream ur master. if u can think, do not make ur thoughts ur aim...(couldn't think of any inspiring quotes nowadays, sori abt it)::
