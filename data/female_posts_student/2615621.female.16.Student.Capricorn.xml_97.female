At times i wish i was bulimic so i wouldnt have any trouble getting rid of that barfy feeling. All honesty, bulimia isn't something to joke about..i applogize. I wish i had the will to throw up then! lol thats better. but..it's too messy.   MAN I WISH MY GUITAR WOULD COME IN!! its suppose to be here this week no doubt, but im like UGH i want it. lol   My dad told me i needed to get out and get some sunshine. lol sunshine..wow why would i need that? haha actually, i love sun, and i do go out to get sun, but i rather sit around, watch reruns of Saved by the Bell and have that deep down pukey feeling. Now, isn't that the life? of course it is.   Right now im listenin to Yellowcard..great stuff. gotta love YC. Tonite NORTH SHORE comes on!!! yay 2nd episode! haha It's a new drama filled with beautiful people, lifeguards, and martinis. did i mention hot guys? haha   *much love and pink highliters*
