So anyways, Josh (Moeller) is all pissed off at me because I didn't wave to him yesterday. So he spent the entire hour telling me how I wasn't his favorite Liz anymore. And then Megan was totally being a bitch, so I stole her pen and ran away with it....dude she totally violated me trying to get it back. Anyways, I threw it away in the locker room. It was funny because I never liked her in the first place. Hehe, anyways, I'm going to the first night of one acts tonight. Fun stuff. Ugh, 2 days and counting until its over...Ok, I'm off.
