Fortunately for me, my family decided to postpone going out to dinner until tomorrow night!  Ruby Tuesdays is our intended destination.  Yummy!  I've never been there before so my hopes are that it will be tasty and not too slow.  Woah, I could make a randy joke about that one.  Heh.  Nevermind.  Of course, I must speak of play.  Rehearsal was long as usual.  Nothing out of the ordinary (ie: crazy, life-threatening accidents, raccoons running rampant, etc...) occurred tonight, setting my mind at a little ease, considering my earlier hypothesis of the show being cursed.  That WOULD have been kind of cool though, you know, if it had been.  *grin*  Anyway, tomorrow we have practice at 9 A.M., and later a parents' performance at 2 P.M.  Before all of that, however, I am having breakfast with two of my best boys, Aaron and Geoffrey, who are having a sleepover as I type this.  It should be fun.  Any activity with those two is always exciting.  Hmm.  Yet again another randy joke opportunity.  What is wrong with me tonight?  Honestly.  I hate it when people change things at the last minute.  Today, the activities director lady, Betty, called me down from math class.  (I am the banner singer coordinator, for those who do not know.)  Anyhow, I totter down to her office, only to discover that the time has been changed for the game tomorrow.  I was to inform the banner singer that he "could sleep in an extra hour."  Oh great.  In a quintessential Katie fashion, I just smiled, said OK to this news, and stepped out of the office.  In actuality, I was very upset.  I knew Betty could have told me much sooner in advance.  A tournament this big would not have been changed the day before.  So yeah, the time of my kind volunteer (hi chase) was treated like crap, and then I was put in the position of compromise.  Grrrr!  I wish people would just take responsibility!  You read earlier that play practice starts at 9 tomorrow, and this new hour delay prevents Chase from being able to sing.  I was disappointed because I know he always does an excellent job and is one of the very few who is actually enthused about singing solo.  Gotta love that.  *smile*  Sorry about the mix-up, Chase.  I'm taking the hint that you're okay with it based on your emissions tonight at play.  Could that be a randy joke opportunity?  We'll just say no, and I'll log out for tonight.  Later, peeps.  P.S.  If you care to, tell me a good joke in my comments.  I need some new material.  Thanks.
