Decisions are too important to leave to chance. reach for ur peak, ur goal, ur prize...  yes, i did limit myself from doing something! so dumb of me to do that!! that's why i never had the chance to be happy with THAT thing.. i hindered myself of something that i know would really make me happy.. and now., it's gone!!   hehe.. that was something of the  past ..  totally buried!  just reminiscing bout it.. dont u wori!!!  never limit urself.. spread your wings!!!
