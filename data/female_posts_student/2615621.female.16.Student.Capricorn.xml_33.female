First my mom comes in my room and literally digs through everything to find my black boots to borrow..She tells me my room is disgusting, oh well, don't diss my shit when ur borrowing things from me, I think she knew that though cuz she didnt say much. She goes to church and comes home all while im still asleep. When she gets home she says "hey go look at the puppy outside" I HATE DOGS, but a puppy sounded like fun so i get up and run outside to see this puppy she's talking about, and knowing my mom, she wouldnt get me up to see an animal if she didnt want me to go get it so we can keep it...so i knew it was a stray. I go out there and there is this beautiful little puppy but as i walk towards it, she runs away. UGH i sat out there in the cold in my pjs feeding it dog treats trying to get it to come to me...didnt work. Mom told me it looks EXACTLY like a dog she loved that she had as a child when she actually lived down the road from where we live now, u can see her childhood house from ours now. haha so yeah, she wants this dog but wants me to catch it and play with it and it be my dog (she doesnt wanna make it seem like SHE wants it, her kids do) haha my mom and animals. Well, i then set up barricades in the neighbors yard cuz it was going under their little kid's fisher price tool bench. It got trapped and just when i touched the pup, she made a sound like a goat and it scared me! haha so of course i backed away and she ran away. She keeps coming back to the food and water i put out. I'm giving her a break but its about time i corner her and just chase her around until i can catch her because shes so skinny and needs a bath. Mom told me her dog like that was the best dog in the world and she called him Leo, i told her we can name this one Leah. I thought it was cute and she smiled. I usually dont like dogs, but this one is a puppy and it's really cute. She looks to be a shepherd/collie mix, or a shepherd/chow mix, we gotta see her tongue to tell, chows have blue tongues no matter what. She is definitely a Shepard because of her markings. My mom said she looks to be about 4 months old. Shes so cute!! i want her! lol I want to get a pink leash and run around the neighborhood with her. My other dog Molly won't do that, but Molly is a good dog and i love on her and play with her too. And she needs a friend..and my mom wants this dog. lol My cat Willie just walked by and it reminded me when he chased the puppy when it came in the yard. My big fat orange cat that was bottle fed by me chased the dog! lol it was a funny site, almost as funny as Molly (a little yippy blue heeler) trying to outdo the rotylier (spell?) next door in the other yard. Theres a chain-link fence between them. lol its funny to see. I hope i catch little miss leah...
