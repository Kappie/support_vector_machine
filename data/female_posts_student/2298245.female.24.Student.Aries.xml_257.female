After the hell of the first three days, busy with classes and reading and schoolwork and everything else, Thursday, which is the one day I can sleep late and not make the trek out to school without feeling guilty, is a welcome reprieve.  Even now that I am bogged down with work, Thursday comes as a relief, for I can devote all my the hours of the day to getting things done without having to worry about going to class or accomodating others or any of those crazy things.    So today, that's what I've been doing.  I slept in, and then finally got my last Journal assignment to work on - so I've been busy with that.  Now I'm getting ready to attack my paper once again.  Hopefully all will go well with that effort, and I'll have some time later in the day to post something more meaningful.  Until then...
