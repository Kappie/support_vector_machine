(or "Hey, I'm being funny!"), the Wink in real life contains several connotations and must be used sparingly and with discretion. Winks have their place on the Internet, but in real life I have never been a fan of the Wink (neither giving nor receiving). However, that doesn't mean that I haven't, on occasion, given an acccidental wink at someone and then been left to wonder how my purely involuntary eye muscle movement was perceived.   Sometimes at work I get so caught up in being phony with the customers, that some other personality takes over, a personality that not only winks, but speaks in a munchkin voice (why do we females equate high-pitched with nice sounding?). It's as if I get so overwhelmed with the fakeness, that I just can't help myself: "Yes, ma'am! That tangerine glass vase looks LOVELY with those Christmas table linens! And you're getting such a bargain!  WINK! "   But it's worse when the ma'am is a sir. Yesterday I winked at Sir Shopping With His Mother and he grinned stupidly at me until they left the store. I just wanted to tell him that I didn't mean it, it was my other personality! I'm really not a winker, I swear!  Thankfully, there are also the customers that I genuinely like and never have to be fake with. Those customers never get winks or helium voice girl, and they seem to appreciate it all just the same.
