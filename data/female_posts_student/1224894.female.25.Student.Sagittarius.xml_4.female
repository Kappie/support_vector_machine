This overwhelming feeling of belongingness when wrapped in the arms of comfort, leaves contentment in my being. I wondered if the stars are looking down on me and yet God makes it easier, as a silent listener, comforter and confidant.   Having made decisions that taught me how to be strong, strengthens my resolve in my quest to change for the better. But, in every happiness, there are still tears to shed and people to miss and engulfed in the pain of loss and leaving.   Once upon a time, i was just a girl, content with the attention showered on me and dancing in the rain. Now that I am a woman, everything is so trivial and the depfth of living is much more unfathomable.
