I don't always mind hanging out with them of course, but sometimes it can get a little old and awkward.   Leslie and I watched The Lion King today, good times.  It was so much nicer when we were little and obsessed with that movie, we'd go outside and play with our tiny plastic animals and make houses out of leaves and pine needles, but yeah, we don't do that anymore.  That used to keep us entertained for hours.  Fun stuff.
