So I woke up at 6 thinking that getting up early is overrated and that if only school started two hours later it would be so much better.  Don't you agree?  But I had to go in early to make up a Physics lab.  (yea fun I know)  But Jessica came with me and helped out.  I don't think I thanked you Jessica for that.  So Thank You!  Then we traveled down to the J-Lab where I worked on a worksheet of AP Lit and Comp that I forgot at school, which Jess also helped with.  But then who should walk in?  Reliving moment:  (feels him looking at me)  "I'm sorry" then he says sarcastically "Yeah, you should be" and then laughs.  That just made my morning.  (Remembering reading an article in a magazine at the dentist office where this guy read some girls online journal and it talked about him in it and how much she liked him and it turned him off to her.  I so didn't just typed what was above ;-) )   In Algebra 2, she put us in these groups and I don't mean to sound rude or anything but the other kids in my group aren't exactly the brightest crayons in the box.  Then in physics we went to the computer lab.  Next up AP Lit and Comp, where we acted which is always fun.  Oh, lunch after that.  Where Mr. Powers and I talked about Jessica's and my band story.  Look for it in the next Nationalist ppls!  FYI: AJ if you're pissed about me taking over your half of the story maybe you should have done work on it so others wouldn't have to!    After lunch comes Chemistry like always where we got to speak in front of the class. Oh, I have to tell you about the Stampede boy in my class.  Do you ever get this feeling from someone that they want to talk to you but they don't know how or what to say?  Maybe?  Well, I get this feeling from this kid.  Lately he's been turning around and talking to me which I welcome b/c I could use some more friends in that class.  Next, comes AP History which was scary!  I HATE DBQs with a passion!  Finally, Newspaper, it was well it was.  I still have issues with AJ.  I have to do my work for the Daily plus her half b/c she never does it and if she won't who will?  On top of that I have to do my Nationalist work!  And all the other stuff Mr. Powers sends me out to do!  GRRR AJ!  Her work ethic is nonexistent.    After school  I walked out to my car with Kurt.  Lucky dude got to stay home from the beginning of the school today and sleep in b/c he was tired.  I'm tired now...  Goodnight all!
