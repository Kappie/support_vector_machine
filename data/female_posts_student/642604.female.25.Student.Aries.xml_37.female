These guys are ridiculous, they need to go back and look at the fact that if they would get rid of the high prices for music maybe we wouldn't download so much.  You know?  Or if I could just buy one song as opposed to a whole cd I don't want it would be cool.  That's one of the reason I think this new iwhatever program (can't remember the name) where you pay a buck a song, it would significantly help the music industry instead of hindering them.  I could go for that.
