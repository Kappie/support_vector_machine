Found a skirt that i simply adore at express, gonna hafta buy it once i get my miniscule paycheck.  Then came home, ate yummy dinner, and then went with ELLY SPINELLY to see Shrek 2! Woah, I've missed her like crazy! It's great seeing old friends that even though we've both changed, we're still really close! So walked into see shrek but elly spontaneously decided to go see stepford wives! so we went to see taht! *it was super crowded* It was pretty good! [[halfway thru the movie this huge thunder/lightning knocked out the power for a sec, then the noise on the movie was gone and very lightly in the background you could hear, Day-o, day-ay-ay-o Daylight come and he wan' go home--haha]] I was supposed to see it today with some gals and then go swimming but i dno if i can cuz Jill and my dad's flight to boston is tonight.  Oh well, we'll see. Then El slept over, looking through the RCHS yearbook, talking bout old stuff, new stuff, everything. She hadta leave early this lovely saturday morning tho cuz her cousin is flying in.  So now im just eating breakfast and listening to Rooney.
