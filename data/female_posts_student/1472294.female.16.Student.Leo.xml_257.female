And I just love her outfit, especially the female outfit. The male outfit is like a mini copy of Johnny Depp character in 'Pirates Of The Carribean'. But I heard that Jolin had to wear three layers of skirt for the female outfit, not forgetting the corset. Whoa! But Jolin looked really dainty and sweet. I just love her curls. I am going to curl my ends when my shoulder-length hair grows longer.
