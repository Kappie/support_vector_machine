So since I like it so much, I am going to post the lyrics :)  I think I'm drowning asphyxiated I wanna break this spell that you've created  you're something beautiful a contradiction I wanna play the game I want the friction  you will be the death of me you will be the death of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out  I wanted freedom bound and restricted I tried to give you up but I'm addicted  now that you know I'm trapped sense of elation you'd never dream of breaking this fixation  you will squeeze the life out of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out how did it come to this? ooooohh  you will suck the life out of me  bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  our time is running out our time is running out you can't push it underground you can't stop it screaming out How did it come to this? ooooohh  Keke, I'm done now.   In other news, I'm a little worried about Greg...I need to talk to him.   *sigh*  More later when I'm not about to hop in the shower :)
