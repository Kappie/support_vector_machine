Spring break, however, is four short days away, although I'm sure I'll fall into a motionless time warp the second I step back into school. Daddy comes in six days on the tenth. He'll be here for most of spring break.   Random persons come everyday to see the house. Mum thinks we'll sell soon.  Rob leaves for Switzerland on the 14th.  In three months or so I'll graduate from High school.  My life is about to change.
