Same for Mr.Hanson. Its like "oh, how is he doing in the I.T". Hehe.  Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  Probably Andy or Dave, Nic.J as well.  Ive forgotten what kinda sight ive got. I can see close up things easily, but looking far away looks really blurred.
