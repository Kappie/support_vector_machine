Anyways! today's my very  1st day at work . basically, my sister, her friends, senior xiongster and i have to report to work at 8.30am daily at MOE (tiong bahru examination branch) to do  coding . it's fairly simple. we handled the O level malay and tamil papers today. copying and checking of marks. heaps of paper work. the staff there are really nice though! they gave us tea-breaks, spoke to us patiently and taught us how to go about doing stuff right :) i would say 45 bucks is good money! snr xiongster and i are gonna eat rice tmrw. definitely! heh. cos we were still hungry after eating a bowl of S$2 meepok today. it was wicked, yet a rather small portion, considering our big bellies! we ended work at 5pm and i don't know why i'm still feeling quite pschyed! but at the same, pretty much beat, cos' i woke up in the middle of the night at 3.30am to look for food *oops!* then at 6am to get ready for work. i also have a muscle ache from the sat's monkey bar.   On a brighter note, i can't wait for tmrw's passing out parade. *Woot!* :D til' then, keep loving!
