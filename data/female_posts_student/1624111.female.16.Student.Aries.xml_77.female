My mom and my brother sititng in leather chairs playing monoploy chewing orbit gum in my parents bedroom in arizona...that smells like the Grattons house. when they lived in illinois. you know how peoples houses sometimes just have smells? and its not an uncleanliness thing...its not a gross smell kind of thing...its just like...a characteristic smell. you know what im talking about? yeah. just so weird... how smells can remind you of other smells and bring back all these memories and sensations and feelings and...just, wow.  and...i dunno...i could give more examples...but... itd get kinda creepy... just because of the subject matter and stuff...   but yeah...i dunno...smells...crazy.  "Sometimes a man will walk by who smells of my ex...He smelled of hot sand. I am always tempted to follow these people wherever they are going. To catch their elbows before they disappear into the crowd at a tube station, or scribble a note to slip into their pockets. I want to know what scent they use. To ask what right they have to smell like what, for me, will always be sex itself." -not exactly what im talking about, because...yeah...sex...but i dunno. ill include it cause i feel like it. from that "call girl"s blog.
