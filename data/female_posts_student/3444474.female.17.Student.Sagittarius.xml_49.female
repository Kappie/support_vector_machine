It's really a light one, barely noticeable, but I am noticing it, and I spent a good five minutes just rubbing my temples, it subsided for about thirty seconds, and then came back, a little stronger too. I think it's the tension in my neck and shoulders. I need a massage...really bad. :-/  Listening to  Velvet Revolver  at work, go me :D   I am annoyed. I can't find four resume's that I need to make phone calls...I might have given them to my boss inadvertently in a pile of copies. *sigh* but she's in a meeting, so I've gotta wait.   thank God my day off is tomorrow, I am tired. I need the sleep. I get paid again soon, yay :D  I think I figured out what I wanna get Cameron for his birthday, teehee.  (I know he reads my blog sometimes, so I'm not saying anything!)  Back to trying to find these resume's...uuuuck
