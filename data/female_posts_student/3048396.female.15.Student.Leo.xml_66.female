So yeah I wont be able to write cuz im gonna be with my sweetie pie tomorrow...get to take her swimming....shes so cute! and then Sunday is church...Howards last Sunday. Im gonna bawl and get great big hugs from both him and Jean....It'll be sad...but about an hour later I'll be leaving for Cuttys to meet Kait and then leave...so I guess I wont be on untill the 27th...the day before my crappy birthday. Yes crappy...I get to sit on my ass all day and not do a damn thing with anyone cuz *shrug* no one is around here. I might get my favorite supper and then I'll open 2 whole presents...and I'll call it a day. Anyways...goodbye for now....  Tara
