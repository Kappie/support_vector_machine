I had been playing computer games, surfing around, taking care of my yet-fully-recovered sis, slacking around, reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and watching TV programmes. There are many scenes and events in Harry Potter tat are not shown in de movie! It's really nice. And looks like Snape's character is slightly worse in de book! Very very nice..! Can any kind soul lend me de 4th and 5th books(Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix)? ^^  Also, i wont be updating this bloggy unless i've something to write(or type). Added 2 people to contribute(post) on my blog.. Fenix n Peabrain.. For fun lorx. ^^ Also, ive learnt more about html n stuff.. Credit to Kheng Wei's   urlLink webbie  , which provides a simple guide about html and java. He's still working on it though. Hope ya complete it soon! In addition, i added polls and counter at the sidebar! Cool huh? Well anyway, i found this interesting story on de web recently... It's very meaningful and interesting. There you go~~~    A King in Africa who had a close friend that he grew up with. The friend had a habit of after looking at every situation that ever occurred in his life(positive or negative), he'll remark, "This is good,   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best."  One day the King and his friend were out on a hunting expedition. The friend loaded and prepared the guns for the King. The friend had apparently done something wrong in preparing one of the guns, for after taking the gun from his friend, the King fired it and his thumb was blown off. Examining the situation  the friend remarked as usual, "This is good!   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best."  To which the King replied, "No, this is NOT good!" and ordered his soldiers to put his friend into jail in fury. About a year later, the King was hunting in an area that he should have known to stay clear of. Unexpectedly, the cannibals captured the King and took him to their village. They tied his hands, stacked some wood, set up a stake and bound him to the stake. As they came near to set fire to the wood, they noticed that the King was missing a thumb.   Being superstitious, they never ate anyone who was less than whole. So after untying the King, they chased him out of the village. When the King reached his palace, he was reminded of the event that had taken his thumb and felt remorse for his treatment of his friend. He went immediately to the jail to speak with his friend.  "You were right," the King said, "it was good that my thumb was blown off." And he proceeded to tell the friend all that had just happened. "I am very sorry for sending you to jail for so long. It was bad for me to do this."  "No," his friend replied, "This is good,   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows  best."  "What do you mean, 'This is good'!? How could it be good that I sent my friend to jail for a year?"   The King's friend replied: "Remember that   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best and if I had NOT been in jail, I would have been with you."       Surah Al Hajj  22:76  He knows what is before them And what is behind them: And to Allah go back All questions (for decision) Do not judge things or events by its immediate outcome!    Comments anyone? Interesting huh? Oh, the 4th paragraph was a bit lame though. And i duno who on earth's   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala  .. Hehex.. Guess it must be some God or something of some religion. Cuz got 'Allah'.. Ritex? Then again, I don't really believe God exists... To me, believing God is like believing luck, its a phenomenon. Then again, if You really exist, don't be offended in anyway. Just in case, lolx. ^^"  Finally,   One   last day left. Patience...    The King with a Missing Thumb ^^   Quote: When the solution is simple, God is answering. Quote 2: Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
