Plus, a few people who don't read all that often said they'd read more often if I wrote more often.   I'm so glad 4:20 day is over, cause the shouts of, "Four Twenty!  Celebrate the holiday" were getting old.  However, I love to hear the stoners' stories on the day after, which always begin with, "So I was about to get out the parking lot to go smoke some shitake mushrooms (my substitute for their word)."  There's an awesome story I heard, but it's really mean so I can't tell it...plus it would get a lot of people in trouble (CENSORED).  See, Tripp, I don't rat out people, even though I really dislike two people involved. Well, as usual, I'm procrastinating.  What I should be doing: studying for a history quiz, studying for a chemistry quiz, doing my rough draft, reading  A Tale of Two Cities , and doing math homework.  Quite a list.  Right now, I'm most worried about my rough draft, cause it's too long.  My research paper's supposed to have an absolute maximum of eight pages.  I'm halfway done, and I'm already at ten pages.  I wonder why...everyone else is struggling to make the minimum six pages.  I don't understand why I have to limit myself...I'm a bit long-winded (judging from the archives of ten days each lol).  If I had no restraint, I could easily go on for about twenty pages.  After all, taking over the world for dummies is no short task. I have found a new love: Big C's rhymes.  Not love for him; my sister and all her friends are in love with Cory (omg he's so hot, I wish he'd take me to the dance, there's nothing wrong with friends w/ benefits, which they don't know what that entails, omg u've got to get his lifeguarding schedule so we can know when to go to the pool, and so on).  Did I mention that my sister's 12 and we (our birthdays are a week apart...I'm older) are approaching seventeen?  Anyway, back to the rhymes.  Cory makes up these really funny rhymes about people and totally ridicules them.  There's an awesome battle going down in the intersection tomorrow between Nathan D. and Cory at seven (AM peoples).  I heard a preview of Cory's, and it's awesome.  For those who don't go to a prep school (jk it's public but packed w/ preppy ppl), it's a rap contest between two people, usually between guys, in which they pack insults into raps that are rapped in the presence of about 50 people.  Like I said, don't miss the battle cause the Nathan D. II will be awesome.   In the past two days, I've gotten a lot of inside jokes.  For the journalism girls (u know who u r) - do you really blow on it?  I always win ten fingers, which is true, I've never lost...how can I lose?  I've never had sex, done drugs, drank to the point of getting drunk, smoked anything, had a party in which the cops came, made out with a guy/girl or shoplifted anything priced more than $10.  It's always fun to play with somewhat promiscuous people, a few goody-goodys like myself, and secret bad-asses...I had no idea Jessica K.!   For Dominick, Julie Ann, Kortny, Yasmin, and all my girls C lunch odd days: It's the Titanic!  It's a submarine!  It's a tugboat.  Wait, can we go smaller?  Wait, don't look over there!  He's standing up!  Oh no, too late...she's choking on her soft cookie.  Laughing at funerals.  Ok this is the apparatus.  No the pencil is the apparatus.  Now what do we do with the apparatus?  Wiggly finger!!  *TABLE SHARING*.  Don't eat the soft cookies with the teeny chocolate chips!  What's tossed salad?  What's ridin the train?  What's a blowjob?  What's (insert term here)?  Hotdogs are Titanics.  I know I told you not to nibble the soft cookies!  Unleash the Titans!  Wait, these are little pigs-in-a-blanket...sure won't Remember  that  Titan!   Well that's about it for now.  Now go make more inside jokes!  Later.
