I'm tired of the bullshit plain and simple. She's been here most of the day and then to find out that they lied to me again about going to the hospital to visit someone I'm beyond pissed off. They've been gone almost 2 hours. Oh well I quit. I know what I have to do and tomorrow I will do it. I wont like it but I am turning his ass in. Kelley has had it to. Marina is so full of fucking shit with her ok one minute and not the next. I quit.  Today I could not get out of bed for anything. I kept falling back asleep but I wasnt really sleeping if that makes sense. Each time I turned around I kept getting weird feelings. I just couldnt seem to wake up.. Oh well all I want to do is go back to bed. I think it has to do with the depression. Depression and worry. Plus the fact it seems I just have so much running around here with no real time to myself and the time I do have to myself I'm busy thinking about things. (shrug) it will get better.   Well A.C. hasnt shown up. Tomorrow is the 1st. He said he would be back by then. I guess .. well I wont write it here I cant put words to it. I hope that M. is right and as much as I try I cant seem to hold on not when so much is going on in my life it is asking to much. But then I'm use to being the strong one alone depending on myself. Nothing will change. Where ever he is I hope he is safe. I must go I know this is short but I want to do a few things and then go back to bed and maybe read something.. Get lost in a book or whatever..
