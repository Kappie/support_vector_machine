Especially this song. This is my favorite song on the whole CD. I've listening to it about 6 times in a straight row one evening. I like it a lot. I always repeat it at least once. Anyway...listen to it if you get a chance...I'm planning to put my review of the CD up on Amazon.com soon...    "Okay, I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't"  by Brand New, from their album "Deja Entendu"  I am heaven sent. Don't you dare forget. I am all you've ever wanted, what all the other boys all promised. Sorry I told. I just wanted you to know. I think in decimals and dollars. I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We are never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth, then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out...Wish I knew. I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with whoever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose and don't have the cure for. Holding onto your grudge. Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love. And keeping quiet is hard. 'Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. We're concentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now we're throwing the fights. But I just want to believe, I just want to believe, I just want to believe...in us. Oh, we're so controversial. We are entirely smooth. We admit to the truth, we are the best at what we do. And these are the words you wish you wrote down. This is the way you wish your voice sounds - handsome and smart. Oh, my tongue's the only muscle of my body that works harder than my heart. And it's all from watching TV and from speeding up my breathing. Wouldn't stop if I could. Oh, it hurts to be this good. You're holding onto your grudge. Oh, it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love. So let it go. This is the grace only we can bestow.  This is the price you pay for loss of control. This is the break in the bend. This is the closest of calls. This is the reason you're alone. This is the rise and the fall.
