Then I remember it is theatre�children�s theatre to be exact, so why even ask such silly questions.  The cast of �No One Will Marry A Princess With A Tree Growing Out Of Her Head� will be performing this morning at the Barnes and Noble in Lancaster. God bless Publicity. The bookstore has advertised this mornings performance along with a �Prince and Princess Day� for the kids. Parents are encouraged to bring their children dressed as Princes and Princesses to watch us and participate in a parade around the store. Let me tell you how excited I am about this�  On another happy note, I recently auditioned for �Machinal� by Sophie Treadwell. It will be the AVC production following the children�s show I am working on now. It is centered on the story of a woman who cheats on and kills her husband (fun, fun, fun). It will be the department's workshop production, and the director, Kelly Williams, has been flown in from Hawaii to work on the show. The roles of the young woman, her husband, and her lover have been cast individually, and five additional ensemble cast members will play the remaining twenty-something characters to complete the show. I was cast as an ensemble member! I am really excited, this will be the first show I have worked on like this, and some old friends have been cast along with me�Benny Wills, Joseph Stevenson, Joaquin Alvarez, and Justin Greene. I think the show will be great fun, and have no doubt that with these hoodlums, there will be trouble to be had. That�s for sure!  Well, my actors should be showing up any minute, so I better get to doing my job. I hope everyone who reads this is well (all 3 of you that may or may not exist). Take care.
