(okay, it's not that bad or I wouldn't be able to type, but there is a pretty nice swollen lump on the back of my right hand that doesn't want to go away despite repeated icings).  I had to call first aid so some one could bring me up some "sting stop", which didn't really help that much anyway, and the guy had to fill out all this paper work, just for one little sting.  But I guess for insurence purposes...  I kept working anyway, although it was hard to serve ice creams because I was trying not to bend my hand.  I guess the sting was payback for the many wasps I've sacrificed to hot water for the common good (and our sanity up at the Soda Fountain!) but I think I would have rather slammed my finger in the door - oh wait, I did that too!  Not having much luck with my hands today...  at least I'm about to sleep so I can endanger them with knives and other potentially hazardous items.  Words of Wisdom:  stay away from wasps drunk on sugar, and angry because you've just tried to drown them in really hot water, and when shutting doors behind you, hold firmly to the handle.  That's all for now. :)   p.s. I'm really not a bad person, I only killed those wasps because they were a danger to us and the visitors, and our (by us and ours I mean me and my coworkers) mental health - have you tried to pour a pop with five angry wasps buzzing around your head and hands?  not a fun activity!)
