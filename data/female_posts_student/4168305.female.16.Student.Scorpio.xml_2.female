The Relationship Assessment Test:  Amy, your relationship is more likely to last if you and your partner improve how you   understand each other's strengths and weaknesses  .    The Zodiac Match Test:  Amy, the best Zodiac Match for your personality is   Leo  .   Palm Reading Test:  Amy, your palm reveals you are especially good at   letting your love flow  . Our psychologists were able to confirm what palmists have known for centuries: the lines in your palm reveal many things about you - including details about your future. Your palm shows you are a very warm and compassionate person. You give your affection freely to friends and family that you care about most   What's Your Back To School Style:  Amy, your back-to-school style is   Funky 'n' Fabulous.      What's your Cat's Type:  Amy, your cat's a   Mugger  . Talk about mugging for the camera! That's right, your cat's a natural-born showoff with a wild independent streak. How else would they end up being the center of attention so often? And really, what could be more endearing than a furry little friend who steals the show â€” whether you're home alone, or hosting a dinner party?   What Zodiac Sign Should You Be:  The planets are very complex. Maybe your astrologer will disagree, and maybe a few tendencies will vary, but overall you're a   SCORPIO  . You're just like a water sign, which comes out in the way you're so in tune with your emotions and your intuitions. Your symbol is a scorpion, which represents your secretive nature and your ability to emit a powerful poison when vengeful. A bundle of contradictions, you have the ability to demonstrate both the best and worst qualities that characterize human nature. Generally, you are intense and passionate, yet stubborn and competitive. You use your intuition fearlessly, and you have a tendency to explore the nature of existence through the study of philosophy and religion. Although it is difficult for you to trust others, whenever you finally do, the result is deep and powerful. On the downside, however, you must work hard to suppress your jealousy. Your dedication, drive, and persistence will guarantee you success, and you are known and respected for your imagination and idealism.   What's Your True Colour:  Amy, your true color is    Blue   ! You're blue - the most soothing shade of the spectrum. The color of a clear summer sky or a deep, reflective ocean, blue has traditionally symbolized trust, solitude, and loyalty. Most likely a thoughtful person who values spending some time on your own, you'd rather connect deeply with a few people than have a bunch of slight acquaintances. Luckily, making close friends isn't that hard, since people are naturally attracted to you - they're soothed by your calming presence. Cool and collected, you rarely overreact. Instead, you think things through before coming to a decision. That level-headed, thoughtful approach to life is patently blue - and patently you!    Getting a bit bored of taking tests now.
