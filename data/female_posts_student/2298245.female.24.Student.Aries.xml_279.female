This is all that remains of it, and I still do not understand how this much of it survived:   In today's segment of St. John's Law School Hall of Shame, we are transported (rather unmagically, I'm afraid, by the intake of too much Mountain Dew) to the ladies restroom on the 1st floor of the library, where I just rather remarkably encountered two girls having a giggling conversation while standing in front of two of the three avai   I'm sure you can all see the makings of yet another wonderful post from me.  Perhaps if I have energy later, I will try to recall my brilliance.  But it is never as good the second time around.  Light on the blogging today I know, but had and have big plans to attend to.  Finishing up my Journal assignment, and then off to the Journal dinner.  Not looking forward to it at all - but I'm starving, so at least there will be something to eat.  Not that I didn't already pay through the nose for it.
