Nobody noticed my nose ring, well my girls did and they liked it, but the teachers were baffled! But US Night... the White caught me and made me wait and talk to Zazu. It went something like this: Allison: "Hi!" Zazu: "I don't understand what is going on." A: "Well, I did this." Z: "I told you you couldn't do this, you need to go take it out." A: "I can't take it out, it'll close up. If there is a problem you can call my mom." Z: "Well, I obviously can't call her now. Why did you do this now?" A: "It was the only time I could do it." Z: "You couldn't have done it next week?" A: "No, I'm out of town." (a lie) Z: "I really do not know why you would do this! What do you think you are going to do next year? You need to go to the bathroom and take it out right now. I can't let you go out like that." A: "I really don't think people are going to be looking at my nose! I had to do this for myself!" Z: "THIS IS NOT RELIGIOUS!" A: "I'm sorry, and I mean no offense, but culture is in the eye of the beholder. You can't tell me what is culturally right for me. I have had a bad year, and I had to do this for myself!" Z: "If we can't find a bandaid, you are taking it out." We ended up getting a bandaid and it just drew more attention to my nose. F you Zazu and CSG!  That night was the FOB concert. After the seniors blindfolded us and then did that creepy chant thing, Liz dragged me out. I changed shirts on the middle of 270- it was the best show of the night.  We came in a little late, in our CSG skirts might I add. Basically Fall Out Boy was good, but I moved to the back to see and breathe better. Afterwards we went to try and find the guys. I started to remind Patrick about us coming in our uniforms, since he asked us too, and he remembered and that was sweet. Pete remembered Elizabeth, yet again. BASTARD, I AM ALWAYS THERE TOO, haha just kidding. I embarrassed myself in front of Joe, my favorite. I told him it was a good show, but like all of them, they get a little crazy and it's hard for us short people. His response? An annoyed, "Sorry". No, I meant, ooh I'm sorry, let's just have sex. WHAHA just kidding. Later he said he was born in September, like me, and we did a mirror reflecting thing. Odd, like him. I saw this hot guy and I pointed and said, "He's hot!" Then he looked at me and blushed and said he was embarrassed. Me too.  I babysat before graduation. I don't even know what to say. Basically the six year old girl stepped on her eight year old brother's crotch, then slugged me in mine. She took off all her clothes. He grabbed himself in front of me. She put her barbies in her pee. They said "winky" at least 1,000 times. Graduation was boring. But that night was... HARRY POTTER TIME BABY! First I went to Tiarra's graduation party and was hit on by some gangstas, I was frazzled and didn't know what to do. The movie line was crazy. We took pictures with a Sirius look alike and I saw a girl from the FOB concert. The movies was good, but any hardcore fan was a little upset afterwards for various reasons. Ann and I made up gross stuff on the way back to her house.  Friday was the Lola Ray concert with Anna in Cincy. It was good! They are really sweet and talked to her forever. After our interview, we sat and talked for three hours. I was really out of it and probably really rude, ooops. She asked them what they wished they were better at. The hot bass player responded, "Sex, I wish I was better at that." Wanna practice?? The brown lead singer dedicated a song to brown people. And he went to a private school like me and it was Episocpalian like me! CRAZY! SAT 2's were hard. Eww I hate Pickerington. I helped my mom with our garage sale, went to Mari's graduation party, and then went to Trisha's work. We ate pizza and drank soda and watched 8th graders swim. Ann was flirty with them. OOOH ANN LIKES EM YOUNG, CRADLE ROBBER. Actually, we were all going crazy. One with a lisp said, "I'm a fucking player." Right... not! It was pretty funny. The Blockbuster guy was hot. Love it!  College class is dull.. PERRY ROGERS YOU TALKED FOR TOO DAMN LONG. I'm out.
