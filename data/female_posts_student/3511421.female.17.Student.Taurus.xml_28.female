People, and I'm speaking for myself as well, shouldn't be so uptight and let things get to themselves so easily. One of my favorite bumper stickers is 'Shit Happens'. Even though it's so punkish and "iwannabeabadass"ish, it speaks the truth. Things happen and life goes on, yet often when bad things happen to people they stand at a standstill yet the clock is still ticking. I've learned that the more you dwell on things, the more it will tear you apart and that life doesn't have to be so complicated.  There are countries with lots and lots of people just struggling to survive. Never knowing when they will eat their next meal, or whether they will get medicine when they are sick. Yet all of these people tend to enjoy life to the fullest. Yet in countries such as America there is a bunch of whining drama queens who have been raised with no respect or morals and when things don't go their way they practically lay down to die or threaten suicide. (Wow this kind of reminds me of the movie Thirteen)But who's to blame? It it the parents? Society? Media? Being raised in America with the strictest and most caring parents, I have been given such wonderful opportunities that I often take for granted. Opportunities that kids in other places could only dream of. And although I haven't quite decided whether I should regret this, I do know that the future is quite a scary place being run by a bunch of out of control, rebellious, sluts, but then again, I can't speak for everyone. I hope this doesn't offend, because this wasn't the intention.
