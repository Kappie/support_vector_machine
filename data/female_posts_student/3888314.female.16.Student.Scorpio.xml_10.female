My agony is allowed some relief As I see you laying ther peacefully And then my body is flooded with grief, As I understand what's happened fully, Look at me, see what a state I'm in. But it;s not your fault, this pain I endure. You can't help the struggles I have within. Today is the last time I see you here, I see you lying there, eyes shut and dry. Don't worry, memories will never die.
