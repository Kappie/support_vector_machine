She bought me a pair of buffulo jeans, a gap halter top and a hot pink zipper cuff. My mom bought herself some clothes too. We spent like 130$. And we were 10mins late on the parcometre thing. but we werent caught. and then we got home. and I tried to make the bed. I didn't do a great job. and mom got fussy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I went shopping today with my mom.It was fun though. Not just because she bought me a pair of buffulo jeans, a gap halter top and a hot pink zipper cuff. She got my sis one its black and I want it. if my sis doesnt want it I get it. And she also got her another cuff which is weird though. then we went home and things were good until I made the bed poorly. My sis's bed actually and her room was really  messy.It was hard to put the quilt thing in the thin colorful cover and I asked for help and mom freaked at my sis's mess and got all pissy. Not fun. I'm working on my pics page. Cuz I am redoing it.
