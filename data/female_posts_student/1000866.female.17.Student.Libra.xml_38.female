So very slowly....  1, 2, 3, 4...5 seconds.   Wow, and no one's around to talk to. I'm going crazy though. I don't like for people to see me like this. It's bad, very bad. I'm listening to some jazz, which is always cool. Yeah jazz.   Music....music auditions...is it me, or does everything I think of remind me of that audition? No one's online, and...argh. I don't even know if I'd want people to be online. I'm freaking out so much that...wow, I don't know. What do I do?  Ahhhh...how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuch wood? Yeah...uh huh. Woodchuck are amusing animals. And...yeah, I'm a loser with no life, so I'm sitting here typing anything that comes to my mind.  My parents aren't home, so they can't drive me anywhere, and I can't drive yet, so...heh. I'm stuck. I was gonna do something with Jim, but...couldn't get a hold of the parents, so, so much for that plan.   I need to read. Reading helps me escape from everything, and I need my blanket, and milk, and cookies, and I need to be a little kid tonight. That's what I need. No cleaning for me, as much as I need to clean my room, I'm not going to. I need to be a kid tonight, and forget all this audition stuff. Mmmm....cookies. I love cookies so much.   Maybe I should do my informative speech in speech class on cookies, except..maybe I'll do it on albinism. I don't know. Probably albinism. Maybe I'll do my persuasive speech on why everyone needs cookies and milk sometimes. :)  I'm really just rambling, but...it's actually fun in a weird sick twisted way. Except, not really sick and twisted, just weird. Wow...I need a life I think. I'm having way too much fun typing in this thing. Haha, I'm listening to Count Bubba. Such a great song. I absolutely love the soli section in it.  I think I decided, except, I don't want to say what I decided, because...yeah, because I don't want anyone to know. No one reads this thing anymor, but just in case.  There I go with puting up the walls again. I need to trust people more. Possibly this isn't the place though. Here, I'm trusting everyone who could potentially read this. Eeks. That's a really scary thought. I wish....I really do wish.  That would be so cool.  I'm probably thoroughly confusing everyone by now. Sorry.  That would be the coolest thing in the world.  Hmmm, this is reminding me of this e-mail Erica sent me a few days ago with happy thoughts in it. Haha. It was a most excellent e-mail, I was in a really bad mood, and it helped cheer me up. One of them was having a boyfriend and wearing his sweatshirt and having it smell soooo good. Mmmm. Haha. I love guys who smell good.   I really don't even know what I'm typing about anymore, but I can't stop. It's addicting. Haha. I really need to find myself a boyfriend. Yes, I've decided, I must, but it's difficult when NO ONE LIKES YOU. haha.  I don't think I belong in High School that much. I still like people, and love my friends, but sometimes I don't feel like I truly belong. I feel loved though. :)  My friends are all so great! They make me happy. I have to be normal at lunh this week with kelly and emily though, since kelly's exchange student is coming.   Sigh. I really loathe wanting a boyfriend. It makes me feel like one of those valley girls who wear make-up and do their hair all the time. I know that's not true, and I know people who want boyfriends aren't all like that, haha, that's just how I feel.   I give up, again. OK, now I actually have a few people to talk to, so, I think I'll stop typing....now.
