I still watch it whenever they show it on Disney Channel. :)  Anyhow,  I haven't seen  XXX  either.  I heard it was pretty good.  Jeff saw it with Joey while I was in Kansas for Ching's wedding.  I don't like to go to the movies by myself so I guess I will just wait for it to come out on DVD.  Ching, did you call me today? Sorry I missed your call. I was probably in class already when you called.  Speaking of class, good luck with school Daf.  :)  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  :)  Net, sorry to hear about your tires.  Hope you'll find a cheaper place to do your car's 90,000 mile tune-up.
