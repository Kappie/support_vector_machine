I purposefully didn't explain that part of the joke so that, you could see that when i don't explain the joke, you guys don't get it or u miss out on crucial parts of the joke like that for instance!!!!  Ok everyone but Mel read on - I can't believe i worte JI..It's weird...coz i kept saying GI out aloud(and at the same time laughing at my lameo joke and how it would make all of u cringe)..yet i still wrote GI....i think i wrote JI coz the "J" matched the one in "Jane"...and it looked pretty.....  Mel u can read now - i think i'm over Ioan - it was fun while it lasted, he's cute but he don't cut it for me anymore....i'll always remember him and our time together....he's still cute but i see so very less of him nowadays and i feel we are growing apart....however it will be fun to watch you guys fight over him like mad animals - i'll be a spectator for a change!!!
