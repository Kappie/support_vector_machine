Hopes WebSites Will Be a Link to Small Donor" effectively highlights the increasing importance of the internet in everyday life.  The G.O.P. has seen the effectiveness of democratic online fundraising and has decided to try doing so itself; so, it will hire sites to display a link to a donation page.  The question though is why is this such a popular way for political parties to raise money?  First of all it is because it is often cheaper than other more conventional methods of fundraising.  Second it is also easier for people to donate online than to go to the trouble of going to a fundraiser.    An additional and important point though is that "people might be more likely to donate if their favorite site appears to endorse the idea of giving to political parties".  This trust represents an important development in the mass media.  Previously most people would be convinced to donate to a political campaign if a person they trusted supported that party.  Now with the rise of the internet people are putting more trust in mass media.  Now that parties have figured this out they are able to exploit it to raise more funds.  Important to consider though is if people actually have enough loyalty to their site to support a political group because of its apparent endorsement.  I think that in only a few cases to people put enough trust in the choices of their website to actually donate to an organization because of its displaying of an ad. Pax Tirrell
