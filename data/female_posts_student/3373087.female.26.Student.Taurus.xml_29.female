It's good to see my room nearly empty because that means I'm gonna be outta here soon!!    Today was my first day off clinic and I have to say that I'm really relieved. Maybe later I'll look back on this experience with a little more fondness, but right now, but not-so-good last day of clinic is still fresh in my mind. I still have one more record to write up, and I'm eager to check that off my "to do" list.    Today I went to Cambridge House Apartments and left a holding deposit with the management. This place is super nice, and I feel a little guilty for wanting to live in such luxury. $960/month is a LOT of money. In two years, I could have bought a pretty nice car for the amount of money I will have spent on rent. What makes me feel a bit better is that this rent is acutally  discounted   $45  from what I would have paid. Plus, there's only a $100 security deposit that I will most likely get back. Included T1 connection and cable makes the rent a little easier to swallow too. I hate to say this, but I'm actually excited about having a TV again. This means I actually need to buy one though. And if I buy a TV, I need to get a small TV stand or table to put it on... *sigh* Why do things have to cost money? Meem says that the family is planning on making a stop at Ikea tomorrow so maybe I can pick up some things for the new apartment. Part of me wishes I could move in NOW instead of waiting until September, especially since I won't have that much time when I come back from Boston b/c I start school right away. I'm eager to settle in and redecorate. I thin Ben and Cheese will be happier with less animals in the house too.  11 more days until B comes...I keep forgetting that I'm going to LA in a week too!! Yippee! Now I'm glad that I got so much packing done because I really don'thave that much time left.
