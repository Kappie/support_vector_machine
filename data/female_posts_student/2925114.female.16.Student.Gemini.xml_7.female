For instance, everyone knows about my Ottawa incedent. Everything was so planned and I couldn't wait for it, but then that happened.  Apparantley when Chris went he arrived to the guys' house to leave for Ottawa and another band member had his girlfriend there. When a friend of the band's said hey, where's Vanessa? (who was apparantley upset that I wasn;t there, even though I don't remember meeting this guy, oh well)Chris said Graham told me she couldn't come, Graham then said, don't look at me, Nick told me not to, Nick just said well I thought that girlfriends wouldn't be aloud to come with us, I didn't know Roury was bringing his. So yah... that was good to hear about..not. Anyways before I knew this, and after Chris told me I couldn't go I said damnit! I was planning on this for a while I haven't seen you fo a week! SO he said, okay I promise we'll do something on Sunday. Me, feeling discouraged said psssh yah right. But he kept promising. He said they were leaving bright and early on Sunday and we could spend the day together.  So again, I got a day of waiting, he didn't call untill 6.30pm because the guys had slept in the they took forever to get going apparantley, so he said I'm coming over right now, I promised you I'd see you today, let me call my Mom and tell her where I'm going (He was at Nick's house). He called back 2 minutes later, and the first thing he said was, don't hate me. His Mom had yelled at himbecause he was late and she wouldn't let him go anywhere because they were having dinner guests over and he needed to be there. So he said I'm so sorry, I promise, if I get off work early enough, I'll come over tomorrow...i was pissed, from again waiting all day for bad news... So the next day he called and said that it was an easy job that day and he'd be at my house early. I was in my room listening to music, and I heard a knock on my door. Suprisingly enough it was him! I was so happy! Then he pulled out a dozen roses form behind his back. Lucky for him they are my favourite...muahah. So my bad luckiness has come to an end.  I know you all probably don't give a shit about that, or you've got bigger problemsbut I had to write it down...  Maybe the world doesn't hate me after all?
