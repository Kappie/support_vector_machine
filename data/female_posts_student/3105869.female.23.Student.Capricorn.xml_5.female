I am 5'9", with a batchelors degree, working on a doctor of jurisprudence, green eyes, blonde hair, Lord knows I have lost alot of weight, now I'm a size 6, I have a great tan, and I am nice.  What do I lack?  I have ambition, motivation, goals [some philanthropic, others more self-oriented], and a european import for a car.  What do they want from me?  The recently ended relationship that wasn't a "relationship" called me tonight, but why?  What did he want me to say, you stood me up entirely too much?  I can't date someone who values everything more than me?  I'm not a side dish?  I want to be wanted and thats it, I want to have someone who wants to tell me special things first, or call me first when the world crashes in.  I want to be valued, not just another person, but special, important, valuable.  I didn't have that so I had to end it.  I cried tonight when he called.  He said I wasn't being nice when he saw me at school, I asked how he wanted me to react, what he wanted me to say.  I would say it, but I couldn't actually talk to him.  Its still too new, too burning, too sad and over.  I wish it wasn't, but then again, I cannot make myself be what I want to be in another's eyes, it will only happen or it won't.  When did pretty girls stop being courted by guys?
