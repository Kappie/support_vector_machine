Sad, aren't I? Anyway, Just got a whopping fat history essay to do today, ippee. I haven#'t seen PAul in over a week, boohoo. Can't see him today- too much work to do. Might be stating work tomorrow, but who knows? Life's to damned complicated. Tell all abotu DAve's party. I take it this is Dave Dodson??
