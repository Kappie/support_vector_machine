Hopefully, on Thursday I can beat Phillip Deem and take his god damn spot, oh shit...  Water boiling...  BRB *fixes shizzle* I was making cup o noodle and my water was done, yeah, can't wait to eat it!  I doubt I will be able to do a lot of stuff this weekend.  I have to do Millneium Project, work, HW, and religious group meeting...  So depressing.  Actually, I can probably do stuff @ night, SWEET! Oh well, I'm gonna go eat now, but what is the due date of our Millenium projects for 3rd period with Burnside?  Tuesday?  I can't remember. FUCK DA POLICE, ESP. THE ONES WHO ALMOST ARRESTED US! j/k?
