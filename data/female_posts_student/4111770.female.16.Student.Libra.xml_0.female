The last time I dealt with something similar was with diaryland - which I must say, was a lot easier to understand. Or maybe my html skills are a little rusty.  More likely the latter than anything else no doubt.    People often wonder why I have such an interest in China, as is listed as one of my interests.  I can't lie when I say that my Chinese ethnicity plays a huge role - but I guess that's understandable right?  Recently, my interest of the country has shifted from the likes of say, the traditional practice of binding feet (such is the practice that was used on my great grandmother), to the current government and the current society there.    I don't mean to sit here condemning communism and that is it evil and that democracy is the only way to go. I don't know that.  I have never lived under a communist government so I'm really in no position to judge. I'm also critical enough to realize that our Canadian social studies curriculum does put communism in a bad light - which in practice, I guess it is.  The system is theory, is one of good incentive. I can understand the values of egalitarianism and the such.  But in this day and age...  communism = dictatorship   I'm not trying to defend the polticial system here. But I am trying to bring to attention, the blatant disregard of human rights in China.  Forget about worker rights and worker unions. Forget about freedom of speech.   It's a little known fact that as of recently, China has imposed martial like laws that do not allow Chinese citizens to say, write about the government publicly on the internet.  Which of course, has never really been allowed, but now it's been passed into constitution.  Whether or not the law affects Hong Kong is unbeknowst to me.    I'd like to bring to attention a crisis in China that unfortunately, it not very well known.   AIDS   I don't mean to undermine the AIDS crisis in Africa, because no doubt that is the place that needs help most.  But the problem is that the AIDS epidemic is growing in China and hardly anybody knows about it.   Because I don't actually have the material means to help UN AIDS CHINA (read: money), I've made it my personal mission to educate as many persons as I can about the issue - and I know that I've annoyed my friends and they've had it up to their eyeballs with my constant talking of it.  One such friend told me to forget about China and to let go - which actually pissed me off a little. The day I let go will the be day when I am able to say the word "China" to any given random person - and they move to enlighten  me  about the AIDS crisis there.  Because quite honestly, not enough people know.  But it's an important issue.  If AIDS remains at its growing rate in China, in about 10 years time the epidemic will be comparable to that of Africa. Which is a scary thought.   Most everybody knows of the booming sex trade industry in China. The majority of those in the industry don't use condoms.  (on another note, it's a really sad issue. Because often, it's crime circles that kidnap girls and force them into the business. In accordance to that, they also kidnap younger boys and actually cut off their limbs and force them to be panhandlers. Their theory is that, a man with no limbs will induce pity among the general population - and more will give money. It's an ineffective means of making money and its cruel. Most people think I'm pulling their leg with this, but I'm dead serious. Believe me when I say, I've encountered such panhandlers with missing limbs - and the Hong Kong government suggests you not to give any money because it only encourages the crime lords to keep doing it.)   But anyway - the sex trade industry is one main reason for the AIDS spread in China.  Another is the poverty that the citizens live in. Often, citizens will sell their blood to raise money and of course, blood is not screened and hypodermic needles are reused.  And of course, there are drugs. The Chinese government is actually quite liberal with allowing their citizens to use drugs in public - it's drug trafficking that will get you in trouble. And with any nation, needles are often reused.    There isn't much more I can say about the AIDS problem in China. But on another note, it is important to know of the AIDS epidemic in India as well.  In India, there is a common belief that if you have sex with a virgin, the virus will be ousted from one body into the next - leaving you virtually cured.   In the meantime - I'll leave with some sites covering the issue more accurately and in depth   urlLink http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501031215-557111,00.html   urlLink http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aids/china_aids.html   urlLink http://www.worldpress.org/Asia/1739.cfm   And of course, I can't forget   urlLink http://www.unaids.org/en/default.asp    Though I know that UNAIDS does cover AIDS in Asia, as I read in this year's AIDS report.  But the fact remains that I still surprise people when I tell them about the issue. And that tells me that not enough people know.  I have made it my personal mission to educate as many people as I can about the issue. So hopefully, my efforts have been getting somewhere and doing something.
