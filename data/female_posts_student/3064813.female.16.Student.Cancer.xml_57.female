Sorry about that....  OH.  And... Megan and I were watching Requiem for a Dream last night (me because I wanted to, and megan because she craves corruption) and it was good but I ended up singing Rolling Stones all night because I kept thinking about the old lady popping pills and the Rolling Stone's song that keeps talking about "mother's little helper" and how "it helps her on her way, gets her through the busy day" and I don't actually know that it's talking about drugs but it's a really safe guess because everything is about drugs.  So, tip for the future: if someone asks you what a song is about, the safest bet would be to yell "DRUGS!" and look proud of yourself or at least like you know what they're talking about.  With any luck the person will believe you and begin making connections between drugs and the song and your measly ass will be saved.
