Oh, I wish I had my darling Mathew home...that is what I truly want right now, cus if I had my darling Mathew home now...I would be in love with him....even more? Whatever. I'm okay, I just really, really, really, really don't want to go to work today, and at the same time I do because it keeps me away from television and my mind away from constantly focusing on the fact that Mathew isn't home yet. Meh. This sucks.  I'm going to get a glass of milk, I can't think.  Mmm, that was really good.   Anyway. I was thinking earlier today because I made my appointment to get my senior pictures taken. And the thingy they sent me says that you can bring your pets in for no extra charge...So I got to thinking: "Hey, I have a pet chicken!" I want my chicken in my senior pictures, because that would be hot, and she is a cool chicken.  Okay, my complete weirdness is coming to a close...Yea.   I LOVE YOU MATHEW GARRETT!!!!!  Fucking Kangaroos. *scribbles them out*  Ciao~
