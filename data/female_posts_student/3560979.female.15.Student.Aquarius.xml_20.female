Lopez married, and maybe even a baby?   **When news broke that JENNIFER LOPEZ wed singer MARC ANTHONY on Saturday, it was a surprise to everyone -- including the 40 friends and family members invited to the posh ceremony. Tonight on ET, we talk to US Weekly Editor-in-Chief JANICE MIN about how the superstars kept the wedding so secret and the possible reason they tied the knot so quickly!  **"There have been rumors about a baby on the way," she says. "Jennifer has made no secret that she'd love to have children. She's 34 years old, she's very family oriented, she loves her nieces, family is important to her and we know that Marc Anthony loves children too." She continues: "Whether or not she's pregnant right now, nobody knows, probably not. But I would definitely expect a little baby on the way soon."
