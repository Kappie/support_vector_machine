Today my madre (spanish for mother, I'm not spanish or anything, i just like to call her that) woke me and my little sister Paige up at 8:30 in the morning to go to yard sales and stuff. We also went to this cool store in Newport called Dots. In there I got a shirt and some plastic chunky bracelets. We then went to a thrift store where I got 2 pairs of boots for 4 bucks, how awesome is that? Then we stopped in AmeriStop and I got a Starbucks Caramel Frappuchino. I hope I can go to the mall later so I can buy these 2 vampire books I want.      My sister leaves to go to her father's house at 2. I have no plans today. I would usually go over my cousinm Ally's house, but we aren't on speaking terms right now. She hasn't been being very nice to me and she's always depressed and angry at everyone. It's really tough to deal with and be around most of the time because I want to have fun and I'm trying to get better. Hopefully she'll wake up and realize that she misses me then she'll get over herself and call me. Until then I'll just sit around the house and maybe watch "Breakfast At Tiffany's". Hmm...that's all for now. Ta Ta.   you know you love me,   Spazz      STATS:   the book for school: still only on page 8, i'm screwed!   wearing: blue jeans with a red sundress over it, and my new bracelets.   thinking: about how my foot is asleep   listening: to Good Charlotte, my fav band!
