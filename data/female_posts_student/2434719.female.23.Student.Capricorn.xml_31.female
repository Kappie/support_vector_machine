I usually wake up the next day sore in my back from never once relaxing, never once getting the rest i was there to get.   And most importantly, I wake up angry.  I'm still pissed off! The fact that I'm still upset about this, you guessed it, make me even more upset. It's all just a viscious circle. I don't want to talk shit about the person. (yes, yes i do, but i know in the future i'll possibly maybe regret it). he's such a baby. I gave him waaaayyyy too much credit. I backed off for a while, BECAUSE of hte door slamming, the hanging up, the burst of emotion followed by absense and unanswered phone calls. "oh i've grown up i'm old and i have a car." whatever. AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING. i listned to his problems, gave my advice (honestly), and i don't know what happend.... all of a sudden, he's pissed off and takes it out on me. well that was that. the end.  i have a group project today that i'm not really looking forward to. we have alloted six hours together. six. six.  do you hear me? six hours.  tack that on to the anger.  bye.  p.s. today, being almost noon, really hasn't been that bad. :) my banana in my cereal, was the perfect banana.
