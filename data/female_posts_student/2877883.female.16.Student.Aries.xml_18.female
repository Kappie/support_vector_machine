He just says "the music, the music" over and over and over and jumps around with his probably $50 in change in his pockets.  It's quite pathetic.  It's not as pathetic actually as how incredibly cold I am.  But I'll stop complaining about that now because it is probably very annoying.   And so I'm so so not excited about Jessie's girl and Cole coming over (with their parents, of course, aka my parents' friends).  I cannot stand Jessie's girl aka Pokemon boy aka Jedidiahish annoying tender legs (don't ask) and I think I shall definitely use Sar's idea to plot every way I can figure out how to torture him as we eat later.  But I would never do that because I'm such a nice girl.  Usually I am, some people just aggravate me and then I make up mean names for them, but I'm allowed.    Also, if you want a good time, watch Footloose to get in touch with your inner 80's.  It's not actually a very good movie but it is just so dated that I loved it.  So I've badgered (did I just make that up, wait I don't think so) my mother endlessly since we watched that movie on Friday about the 80's and I've come to realize that I'm happy I didn't have to live through it because it sounds very very odd, but I still believe that all those hours of "I love the 80's" have paid off.  Especially how I now compare things to popular 80's toys such as chia pets, weird things.   My mother was super nice yesterday and gave me this wicked good CD (Josh Kelley "For the Ride Home") and the Puma pants that I picked out a little while ago for Valentine's day.  She is a sneaky lady.  My pants make me look like I am a life guard but I wicked heart them.  And my CD is basically another clone of all the other music I listen to but it's really good so I'd recommend it I think.   Going to clean for the soon to be tortured Pokemon boy and others to get here.  I'm excited.
