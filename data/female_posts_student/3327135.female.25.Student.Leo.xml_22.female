I immediately rented the first two episodes and went home to watch it with my roommate.   This show is really good. Flora is really cute in it, but, the only setback is her hairstyle. Although I am a crazy fan of hers, I have to tell what I really feel even though it may not be something nice about her. I don't think she looks good with short fringe. I am waiting for the later episodes, where her hair is tied up. She looks so cool with her hair tied up (from trailers and themesong).  I think this series is a lot better than Hard Fate. But we will have to see how the story goes now. :)   And just now, I had watched again the first episode with my boyfriend. Hehehee.. It is so nice that I don't think I will ever feel bored watching it. Tomorrow, I will watch the second episode again.  Now waiting excitedly for Ep. 3  4 which is due to arrive on Wednesday!!! :P
