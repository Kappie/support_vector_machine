GOOOOOOO COWBOYS!!! of course, i was there with Britty, Ashley and Lindsay because we love our boys. :) That, so far, is the only good thing of my week.  Besides the fact that i got extremely angry at Jimmy for calling me a puck bunny (when he knows fully well that i'm not) and then he claims that he was "just kidding", one of my best friends (or does she remember that?  maybe that was erased when she became a lariette also) plans her 16th birthday party on my 16th birthday which is the 18th of April.  Then she insults my love for hockey by saying that if i want to go to the hockey game that sunday (which is MY birthday so i can do whatever the hell i want) then its "whatever".  At this point, i almost don't want to go to her party nor do i have to because its MY BIRTHDAY and i can do whatever i want.  Ashley was kinda trying to calm me down by saying that it was possible that she forgot, but then aren't we best friends?  shouldn't she remember??!?!!  I mean even if she moved her entire part etc (which she wouldn't but whatever) the pain would still be there that she forgot my birthday.  And this is has been going on all year, where ever since she's become a lariette, she's been bitchy to me and to other people, insulted my interests, told me what i can and cannot do etc etc.  I dunno but i'm getting the feeling that lariettes corrupts people.  aaaaaaggggghhhhhh i am so unbelievably angry right now, its not even funny.  yeah so Stars play Game 4 tonight and they better frickin win or the entire week is lost.  until friday which is opening state day!!!  but yeah, whatever.    Besides my incredible anger towards 2 people, i miss some people a whole whole lot.  Like i see them or talk to them often, but i miss them sooo much.  its weird.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
