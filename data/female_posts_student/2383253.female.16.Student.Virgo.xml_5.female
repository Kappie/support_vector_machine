We talked for an hour about not posting pictures of your drunken and stoned self on the internet, which, apparently, some people decided to do.  I guess they are on the volleyball team, because Trupe said somebody from LCC sent the pictures and the link of the album to him, Anne Meigs, and Schmitt.  He mused at how somebody could possibly drink and smoke at the same time.  Hmm.  US History was pretty boring.  When we first came into class, it smelled so gross, and Nathan suggested that Mr. Evans had died in our classroom.  We had a subsitute and she laughed at how we were all crowded around the open window.  There was a video on the Cold War, but I read Great Gatsby instead.  That book is going to be so good; I really feel like I'm getting into it.  I miss reading a lot.  Journalism sucked.  That's okay, though, cause I went in the pub and did my own stuff until everyone was done.  Convention is going to be great... I get excited about things like this.  I'm so into journalism.  After school Nick and I went to Jamba, then Quizznos, then the beach, then Vons (where we ran into Heather's mom) and that was all.  And here I am, finding myself typing away on my computer.  I'm so glad school is pretty much over after tomorrow, but I'm so scared about calculus.  I need to turn my fear into motivation and not let it paralyze me, cause that would just not be good.  Es todo.
