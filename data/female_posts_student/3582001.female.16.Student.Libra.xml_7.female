Could it be now is the time? Open your mind, where will you go? There is no such thing as fate. It's the decisions that you make that will determine just where you're going to be. But there's a choice that you can make, although you know it's hard to take. On the other side, you'll find the answer and see. With some determination, you'll change the situation from bad, to good, to the best.  -Kristelle N. Bentley
