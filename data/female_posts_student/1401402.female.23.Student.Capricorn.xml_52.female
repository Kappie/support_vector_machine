Performing this function makes me feel warm and happy. Later, I want others to look at me and feel warm and happy but not remember why. I want to do small insignificant task I was born to do and be blissful doing it. I want God to take sips of my soul and be satisfied. I dont want to be thrown away or forgottan. I want to be saved and be downloaded. My function may change, but I'm happy with my role now and while I may not perform it well, one day I might. My dad said the other day that if we knew the future, there'd be no hope.
