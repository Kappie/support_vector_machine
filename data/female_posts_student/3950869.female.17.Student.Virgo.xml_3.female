My little cousin Sean was there-I felt like a little kid again...I played with bubbles(tried to eat one or two), put together a spider man puzzle, and made little figures out of playdough. Later on that night we went out to the boardwalk. Sean and I went on this upside down ride-which was great! Then he and I went rock climbing. It was fun. The houses that I saw though were gorgeous. Yea-and they only run for a million or more dollars. I love it up here-I've always loved the north. Today we planned on going to the beach, but instead we'll be going out to the lake. That's fine with me I guess.  byee
