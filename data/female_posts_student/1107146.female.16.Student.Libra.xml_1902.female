I know, it's hard to, like, even play Tiddilywinks with any more-than-mediocre injury. And it's excellent to hear that you're ok! Just remember: no matter how much it doesn't hurt, that green colour doesn't mean beansprouts are popping up. Altho it would be weird/awesome simultaneously, if that were to happen.  Man, crimeny.   I think we have a flexational on Wednesday, Linds. Yes.   Makkara, miksi?
