Not that my life's that interesting anyway. Starting from the beginning. School Friday: Lots of trouble happening. Police. Weed. Car emblems. Felonies. I won't put in details, because I'm not even sure if what I heard was true. Anyway, yesterday night, I went to the concert at Redwood with Jessica. It was pretty good, and the Mongolian chanting thing was my favorite. Jessica kept pointing out things, and we would laugh over them quietly, and this woman with really weird hair kept on turning around and looking at us like we were juvenile delinquents or something. I mean, come on. If she had noticed the things we did, she would be laughing too. I think...
