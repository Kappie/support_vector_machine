If I ever saw him walking down the street, I would MAYBE stop him and tell him...hmm... what? I don't really know... I mean I wouldnt want to seem gushy, but not aloof either...   Aside:  One day I was in the Village with my best friend and I saw this guy walk across the street and I joked to her, "Oh look at Lenny Kravitz over there" and my friend, who is blind as a bat says, "That IS Lenny!!"  This was about the time when his second album  Mama Said  came out.  So he stops right in front of us and starts talking to the street vendor while my friend and I debate on whether or not to speak to him.  The vendor overheard us and she goes, "Hey Lennie, these girls want to talk to you." And so Lenny turns and smiles and I say to him, "Hieee! I have your first album, it's really incredible, I love your work, truly..." And he's all gracious and is like, "Thank you very much." and then my friend says to him, totally gushing, "OH MY GOD YOU'RE SO GORGEOUS!!"  He was really nice cause he thanked her, but I was soooo embarassed!!  I also used to meet celebs all the time when I worked retail on the upper west side...and that was cool.  I mean, they're just people, y'know?  But see, George is up there on a pedastle... So my point is, I know I'd try to be calm, but it'd be difficult.  I'm just glad he was only on TV yesterday because I had a smile from ear to ear that was embarassingly cheesy.  So ANYway, George was on Oprah yesterday - his first American interview in oh, 10 years or so and he did it with wit and grace.  It was so cute, I actually watched it when they reran it on channel 55 at 7:00pm.  My mother called me frantically to tell me it was on too.  She's cute.  She understands my obsession.    His hottie boyfriend was on too.  George talked all about the scandal and what occurred and why he ended up dropping off the scene and then he said something so amazing... When asked about whether or not he was worried about how people will react to him and how his sales would do being considered a 'gay' artist, he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, "You know what? I live a very good life.  I have everything I need and I dont really care if someone doesn't want to buy my album because I'm gay. I don't  need  them to buy it."  I was all like, 'YEAH, MAN!  YOU TELL 'EM!!'  Then he sang 3 songs and I wanted to cry.  I really hope he tours soon.  I don't think I can wait.  I really hope he doesn't charge like, 50 billion dollars for the tickets.  I don't want to pay that much, but I will fuckin' put a second mortgage on the house if I have to to see him in concert.
