Too many horrible things have happened to me this year. Too many to count on my fingers and toes.  Wow, im on the phone with Sarah. Were confirming our evil plans for tonight. Which include movies, pizza, watching 4 little girls, and acting like complete morons!! YeS! Thats what we defintily do best. I must say. I wonder what the guys are doing for New Years?? Oh, well. I really dont care anymore. They dont give a fuck about me, or whats going on, so why should I care about them. I take that back. One cares. Thats it. And who that is, you know who you are. and it's defintly not the obvious. Dude, the Alice 19th manga is totally awesome! I love that one. dothack was pretty good, but I seem to like Alice 19th and Love Hina more. My Aunt, Uncle, and cousin are uptown from Columbus. Thats cool. My Aunt is awesome to hang out with. My cousin is 11 and he's at the stage where he thinks he knows everything that is going on and how to do everything. And he has no fucking clue. It's hilarious, yet agrivating at the same time. I know, I know I went thru the same thing..but I wasnt obvious about any of it. Well Im gonna skidattle, haha, I cant wait to party. Im gonna go pick something out to wear, and get a tshirt for Sarah. If anyone cares have a great NY!!
