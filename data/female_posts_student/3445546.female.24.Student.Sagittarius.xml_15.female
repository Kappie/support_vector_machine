AGH! i don't want to elaborate any further. i actually might just want to be done with it all. so, one week from my last shitty relationship conversation, i am dreading the next scheduled one....which will be taking place in about six hours. honestly, we spend more time discussing this relationship than actually having one. that might be considered a problem.        i'm not good at real bona fide relationships. boyfriend/girlfriend ones. for so long i have been avoiding such relationships as if they were the plague, instead opting for the always present and suprisingly convenient and fulfilling friends with benefits situation. well, now that i am trying to be a freakin' grown up, i have been telling myself that a boyfriend wouldn't be bad. and i am sure it wouldn't be a bad thing if only i could remember how such a relationship worked. this is a problem. someone needs to alert houston.        totally unrelated, i know why special k cereal is so low in calories....it's because it is pretty much nothing. you eat a bowl of say, special k with red berries, and ten minutes later you are left wondering why you feel as if you have yet to even eat breakfast. it's annoying.        i had to go to the hospital yesterday for what i thought was going to be a simple and easy routine test regarding my crappy kidneys. instead i was there for over two hours, with various ivs and fluids running into my body while some grossly expensive atom counter was imaging the atoms in my frelling kidneys. it was perhaps one of the worst experiences in my whole life. honestly. it blew.        i'm babysitting a 16 year old girl for the next couple of days. babysitting isn't really the correct term, but i have yet to come up with a better one. really, her folks are out of town and she has a known propensity for getting into trouble, so i am staying there. as if i am going to keep her butt out of trouble. right....i was up until almost four am last night waiting for the acne laden teenage boys to leave the house with their 40 ouncers. i forgot what it was like to be 16.        ahh, what else? nothing all that serious, really, aside for the pending repetitive discussion with the 34 year old. of course i will keep you all posted on the results of that, but i can kinda predict what will happen. i foresee me mumbling lots of things rather quickly (works as a confusion tactic) while saying many nice things about him and lamenting my current shortcomings in terms of relationships. then i will stealthily find my ben harper cd. once said cd is obtained, i will proceed to end the situation and go home and deal with a 16 year old. at least that is what i see happening. aside from that, i am going to try to run a half marathon sometime in september, i think. so know not only do i have to run to work off all thecrap i eatwhen i have the munchies, but i also have to run to train for this. should be interesting. i am sogoing to reward myself with something from the mall if i make it all those miles. just so you all know.       but really, when do things ever ever go as i plan?
