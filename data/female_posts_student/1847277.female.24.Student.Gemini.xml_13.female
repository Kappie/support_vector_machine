I read blogs because I'm interested in what other people are doing and not always up for keeping in touch.  Thus, by reading the blog, I can have the benefits of being updated as to what is going on in their lives but don't have to deal with the hassle of maintaining contact.  Since when did I think maintaining contact was a hassle?  Well, okay, I don't really, but there are those people that you were friends (or close acquaintances) with at one point in your life but perhaps just don't have enough to say to to be in real contact anymore.  Ah well.    Anyway, I'm feeling crappy because I missed my butts and guts class AGAIN (the second time in only three weeks) because I had to take the cat to the vet.  She has an eye infection.  And, it's funny, because Matt and I always talk about how she's a little cat and it doesn't seem like she's grown much, but when we got her she was only 4.1 pounds and now she's 8.4.  So she's doubled in size.    Hmm.  I guess people are like that, too.  When you see someone constantly you don't realizing how much they're changing/growing (or how much you're changing yourself) because you're part of the process.  But, if you meet someone after not having been in contact for a long period of time, suddenly you realize that they (or you) have changed so much you don't even know them anymore (or vice versa).   Sadly, I feel that way when I go home, sometimes.  Of course, I never knew my sister or brother much to begin with, but it's happened with other people, like friends from high school.  I don't want it to happen with my friends from college, but change is one of those things that you can't, well, change.  It's a never ending process...
