Never fear. I'll let you know if I win. I talked to Veronica for about 45 minutes today. She's the only person that I can talk to on the phone. The rest of my friends are horrible at it. We came to the conclusion that we're both bored and yet neither one of us wanted to get dressed and do something. Still haven't run out of underwear yet.    Apparently I can only exercise while watching British sitcoms. I've also managed to stay on a diet for THREE whole days! I'm very smug.   Every other word you hear in the media is about "Atkins", "low-carb", etc. I hate it. I'm hoping that everyone on it will suddenly drop dead from kidney failure. Not that that will ever happen because no one's able to stay on it. *sigh* If only I was a god.
