       
       Today there's a voice in my head quietly screaming,  whispering, "you don't belong, you don't belong!"   Can't tell if it's me.  Maybe it's my heart. Maybe it's God calling to my affection-starved soul.  I miss Him today.  Need Him.  Need to feel some glory on my face with its racetracks of tears.   Do you ever have days?  Endless hours of feeling so  far.  So removed.  So helpless.  So vulnerable.   Where are you today, LORD?   I need.
