Oh well, I guess we talked about it and he did repetatively aplogize. So all is (almost) well in the land of Adam and Audrey.   I had to give my communitcation skills speech today. I hate public speaking, but it went quite well. Part of the speech called for a brief biography of Amy Lowell, famous American poet. Well, in my speech I used the phrase 'obese aristocratic lesbian' My teacher liked this very much so because her being lesbian and/or obese was not mentioned in our books. Which means Audrey, being the smart girl she is, looked up more information on the computer. She commended me on a job well done.   Yay, I felt special.   Friday is Adam's and my 6 month anniversary. I'm on my period so no sex can occur, however we are cleaning out his closet (fun fun, rolls eyes) and hopefully I will get him to let us go on a walk or something...oooh maybe the beach. I hate being a hopeless romantic who is in love with a not so hopeless romantic. Ahhh. So is the ways of love.   Well I am going to go for now.
