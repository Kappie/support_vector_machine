You make me so happy, you make my world spin.  There's something in your smile, makes my heart beat fast. There's something in your eyes, that sends chills down my spine. There's something in your voice, makes my heart sing strong.  If you knew how much I wanted you to love me. You'd never be the same.  I feel at home with you, I'm lost when you're not near. Life is not worth living, if it is without you.  My love for you is so powerful, it takes my breath away. My love is so strong, it can move mountains.  I've waited so long for your touch, I never thought I'd love anyone just this much.  Where I belong is in your arms, and you in mine. Kiss me, hug me; I want to lose myself in you.  My love is everlasting. You call, or we talk, and my heart sings.  Ever since I met you, my life has changed. What I want most; I can't have.  Wherefore art thou? My Romeo is near; but to you I am not your Juliet.  My signals you cannot see, the darkness has engulfed me. I need your light and protection, but we are lost from each other.  If it was this easy to find you, I should be ready for a fall.  Like a bird I keep on flying; searching for you, making you strong. You never know when you might have to fly. Will you go after me?  The person I once was, is gone. Love has taken me. My true love; is gone. Flown away, to another nest.    I can't believe I posted that...private thoughts on the internet. oh gosh.
