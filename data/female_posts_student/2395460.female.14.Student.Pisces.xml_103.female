I'm extremely bug phobic but also hyper-empathetic so while I end up drowning spiders that show up in my shower, it always leads to hours of sadly wondering if ants have souls or if beetles love their mothers. Also, number one on my list of reasons to someday get married is: husband = bug killer.  The Bug Wand lets you be squeamish and kind at the same time because it sucks up the bug, but doesn't kill it. You can stand several feet away from the little pest and the battery-operated wand will suck it into the tube, where you trap it only until you can get it outside to fly/crawl away into the great outdoors. Or your neighbor's house.  Get the Bug Wand or other  urlLink amazing products  at  urlLink As Seen On TV .
