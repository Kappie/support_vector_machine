It was a lot of fun but really tiring because there were too many hills!! Each group had their own "specialist" or expert that were part of the Frisbee golf association. Chels and I got a hot guy named Kevin. Anyways, I didn't see Aaron. I guess he didn't come to visit this year. I suppose Halifax is far away. I wish I didn't loose him number and just ignore him at the end of last summer. I constantly think about him and wonder where he is. I wish I could see him because I miss him. Am am strongly guided by my heart and intuition and I KNOW that I loved Aaron. If I saw him again, I wonder if that feeling would come back. I just miss him a lot. I had TRUE love with him. Never felt anything else like it since!! All the Calgary guys are strange, at least the ones I know. Thank goodness Mat and I broke off. Clearly their if NO love at all, and I question our friendship because of some of the things he has said. I am still kind of pissed off with him and I don't think he will be getting invited to my party at the end of the summer. I don't care what he thinks of me not inviting him either. Plain and simple it's my choice and that's final!!!   Anyways I was pretty nervous for my next position paper in Social today because we didn't get the topic before hand, butI mean it was so amazing!! If I don't get like 90% on that I am going to have to kill someone. It was purely amazing writing with supporting examples - far more than I am sure anyone else provided. I feel so good because I just knew the information. Unlike Social at BOB I always had to purely memorize the info. It felt SOOOOOO good just to not memorize pages and pages of information. It was SOOOOOOOO less stressful. I mean I was sill nervous, but I mean that just took stress to another lever. A very low lever. Not to mention everyone was like: "Nice dress" and well it made me feel good. It sparked convo with a lot of people in my class that I haven't even talked to. I talked to this really nice girl Andrea that is from Grandin and this guy from Marys. Our convo started with school of course, but then once I started it he just continued and we talked for like the next ten minutes. It was good. The unit we are doing right now is a bit confusing because it's like an overload of history in a few days. I also have to do an individual unit on the weekend. Then a test Monday, test Friday, and third position paper on Wednesday. Once Friday comes it's all over...and then the Diploma.   I just realized something. I can do just about anything I put my mind to. If I say I want it, then I get it. If I say I am going to do something, then I certainly do it. I also discovered why I have problems with so many things sometimes. It all comes down to comprehension and memory. Tests are confusing cause half of the time I don't understand what the question is asking. I don't always learn info from texts cause since I can comprehend 100% I miss some important details. When I read I forget what I just read until I read a thousand times again and again. Then there is memory. I can study a lot, then get to a test and only "partially" remember something. Since I only remember part of something it makes me mix things up in my mind. I find myself debating with my own conscience half of the time.   Summer School is great. I have become more accepting of the fact that YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DO GOOD ON EVERYTING!!! I have turned negative thoughts into positive ones. It goes a long way. When I score bad on a test or quiz I tell myself: It's only a test or a quiz, there will be others. You can't always be perfect. Now that I think of it, chosing to do Summer School has helped me gain confidence I didn't even know I had stored in me. It has helped me to become independent cause I mean for the longest time I didn't talkto anyone and has to "go it alone." It has also helped me to be less critical of myself and long the the brighter and more positive aspects of life!!
