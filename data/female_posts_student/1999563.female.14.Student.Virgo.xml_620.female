And she just so happened to be my MOST FAVORITE REDHEAD OF THEM ALLLL!!!! BEKKAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! Woohooo!!!  We got to talk afterwards which was awesome possum. She gave me some rockin' footlooose pictures!  Then Brooke walked into too! I was like "whooaaa nelly!" so many footloose people!  Then Laurel came. Hahha. It was just like one big fuzzy love bubble.  Now I am home and getting excited for camp tomorrow!! woooohooo!  We have to leave at 7 AM!!! Ah!! But we are going to IKEA. To bad I wont be getting anything for me...we are getting furni for my dads new office. It's SO gorgeous. I totally have to take a billion photos of it.  After IKEA we get to go to downtown seattle and go out to lunch with my awesome cousin Chrystal! She is soooo coool.Then we might look around downtown and see the BRAND NEW  urlLink LIBRARY!  It's the best library in the WORLD.   Hmm.. I am off to drink some rooot beer.
