After chapel hill my mom and i got smoothies and then her car broke down! GR! [[in a year will be my car!]] So we hadta walk home and then my mom drove me to work in the other car...fun. Work was fine except i had a killer headache.  Josh was being kinda annoying too cuz he wanted me to stay and work til 8 for him and i was like, sorry i have a social life too buddy! Around 6 i got off and carly, caitlin, sapir, and a3 picked me up.  We went to crabtree and shopped [[chocolate @ godiva, clinique, dorks @ eb games, comfy chairs, etc]] then we went to target, got sapir an mp3 player and bubblegum, then went back to a3s.  Called some pple, played video games, hung out, the norm.  Carly brought me home around 1130 and then she hadta take everyone else home too..long story but that was SO frustrating.  Today i hadta get up super DUPER early [6] to work until 3 during the swim meet.  Finished dawn tho=only writing left of summer work! The swim meet was pretty boring tho [[ages 25- like 70]], went home about 3, and now JANBAN'S over! *yay* We're gonna go see The Village tonight! Gotta love scary movies.
