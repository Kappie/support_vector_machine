I don't know who scored the other goal because I only caught the third period because I forgot about it. Yeah, yeah - I'm a bad fan. But it wasn't on TV. Tomorrow, they come back home and play the Buffalo Sabres and Chris Drury, who is my favorite non-Av.   And, for anyone who cares... Marlins up 2-0 in the 9th inning of the game that could win them the world series. (I'm not watching it either, they just said it on the radio.)
