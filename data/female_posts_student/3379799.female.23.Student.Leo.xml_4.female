If Tre is 18, that means my _ss is OLD.  I remember when Tre was a little tyke cuttin' up at field day, and this is when me and Dyonne were still in elementary.  It just made me think about,what my life is, or what's my story.  Me and Dyonne went to a friends house for his nephew's birthday party.  You know black folks, kids' parties always turn into grown folks parties at about 6 o'clock.  Well, this family was playing gestures.  You know, the game where you describe something with out using 5 words listed on a card.  One of our friends aunts began to describe a "wave."  It was so funny, she couldn't say water or anything we normally associate with a wave.  As she began to sway as waves do and mimic a waves movement with her voice, they begin to cheer her on by saying "Tell the story girl, tell the story!"   There is truth in those words.  If someone said they were going to make a movie about your life, what would it be about.  Who are the main charachters, what's the plot, will there be a happy ending or will you be born, do something, and then just die?  I dedicate this blog and this day to young Tre. I'm sorry, adult Tre.  You are now an adult, and soon to be college student. You are now the co-author(GOD is the author) of your story.  Every moment is a paragraph, every event is a page, every year is another chapter.  It is up to you to make it a story of man who lives or the story of a man who shall live even after he is gone from this place.  If you are anything like your parents and your sister, I am pretty sure it will be a bestseller.  For all my other readers: Make your story count. I challenge you to tell your story.  DO BETTER!!
