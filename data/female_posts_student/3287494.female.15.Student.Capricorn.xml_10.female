Ive fallen in love with this lil boy called Karl, hes the cutest lil boy I have ever seen. He's so polite n caring, he begged me to have a short lunchbreak n come out of the feild with him and hid friends. Bless him, I really have grown on that class! Well I guess I will make friends in yr 2 2moro. Im pretty depressed lol, I really like em!!! Well on a different note, not much has happened with me, Apart from being at Oxhey Wood, actually feels like I am in primary skl, Im avin 2 listen to the teacher! Might aswell b @ shity Northwood! well Im gnna retire here for a nap. (ps) I took a picture of venus moving across the sun, Pretty dam amazing I say! xxx
