Burning bridges one by one What I'm doin' can't be undone And I'm always hoping someday  I'm gonna stop this runnin' around But every time the chance comes up  Another bridge goes down.   Like ashes on the water I drift away in sorrow  Knowing that the day  My lesson's finally learned I'll be standing at a river  Staring out across tomorrow  And the bridge I need to get there Will be a bridge that I have burned.
