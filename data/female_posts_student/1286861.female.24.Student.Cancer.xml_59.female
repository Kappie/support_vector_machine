No longer will I be moving to Orange County. 2. No longer will I be starting a job with In-N-Out Burger. 3. I am still leaving work at United Rentals (thank God!) 4. I will be moving to  urlLink Victorville . 5. I will be sharing a two bedroom apartment with  urlLink my mother . 6. I will not be any closer to  urlLink Brenden , which makes me very very sad.  I have given 30 day notice at my current apartment and plans to move will happen sometime before the end of June. My mom's lease is up June 20th, so she will either be moving into our new place (which we are looking for) or moving in with me in my one bedroom apartment until we find our new place. You must agree how exciting this all is.   Brenden, however, was not excited. Neither was my manager-to-be at In-N-Out. I hope and pray that all this disappointment and sadness and sacrifice will turn into unforeseen blessings in the future. I am healthy, alive, and capable...Must focus on things to be thankful for.
