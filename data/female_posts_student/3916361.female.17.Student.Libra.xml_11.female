I had a feeling that we wouldn't have very strong players, and the fact that Manny won't be coaching us this year isn't gonna help at all. Oh well, I guess I will just have to make the best of my senior season and just concentrate on getting my name out there for college coaches.
Well, tonight I have to work again.  I absolutely HATE my job! I thought I was getting paid yesterday, but it turns out that since I am "new" I don't get paid till next week! UUUGHHH!!! I'm really annoyed today about everything.  This morning I had to get up at 9 to go work out with Becky.  I was pretty much falling asleep while I was doing my thing.  And while I was doing--what seemed like--50 billion pounds on the leg press, Carlos (stupid-ass gay faggot who always has to put his fuck ass two cents in) was telling me that I wasn't doing it right, and that I was bending my knees too much, and how it should be easy for me because I was doing it wrong, when in reality, I was doing it just fucking FINE! AAhhhh...anyways...So I slammed down the weights and gave Jess a turn. But thank goodness that I am off of work tomorrow, and I don't have to work out either!  We have practice again, and I am actually excited about that because I get to see how our team plays...And I have a date after that (well after I shower of course).  You know, come to think of it...I have a date with another guy on Friday too. Man, I'll be busy...You know, I actually don't really want to have a boyfriend right now...It's just fun hanging out.
