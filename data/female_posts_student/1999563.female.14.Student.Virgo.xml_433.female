In spanish we played 20 questions all in spanish. It toook soo long! :) She also taught me how to say "cool!" "Whats up?" and other useful phrases. Then  I cleaned until 12. Then I went to Sara's house!! WAHOO!! I had the bestest time EVER EVER EVER!! We went shopping in down town portland! I gota sue-wheat purse and shirt! Then we went to red robin which was VERY good and they sang happy birthday to Sara and put this ballon antenae thing on her. Hahah. It was great! Then we went to Sara's house and watched PETER PAN which is the BEST movie ever. The guy who plays petter is really cute. Hahhahah.  I am off to bed! Adios!  laura
