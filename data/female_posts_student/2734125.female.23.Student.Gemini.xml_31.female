There were four, but I am down to half now.  I am measuring time by the light of this melted wax god, and I am gathering the body that is wasted and keeping it warm against my palms, prayer you might say.  Once I have decided that it is still pliable I make it into tiny animals, goats and dogs and sometimes children.  The gift of the wax god is the ability to allow us to think that we may be gods, that we can form other beings in our mind, to let us think that we have more power then we do.    There is one outlet here, and one phone cord.  I emailed the police, but I got back a neutral response:  Thank you for emailing ----------- county police department.  Due to the number of emails we receive we are unable to get back to you right now.  We will contact you as soon as possible.  Thank you and have a wonderful day.  Then followed several numbers.  I tried using my computer to call, but I'm just not that good.  I have no speakers you see.  Is it really day out?    No, I am sure now that the walls are getting closer.  I can feel their breath now, where as before it was a cool stir of air.  Now it is warm on my arms and ears.  Now it is hot on the top of my thigh.  Now I can hear a cold heat beat from somewhere.  Wait, that fast painful sound may be my own heart.  There are beads of sweat on my arms and legs.  I didn't notice till now, but all my clothes seem to be gone.  I can possibly make porn (if I had a camera on this damn computer) but I couldn't save my life.  Snuff porn then.  I never knew why they were beads of sweat till now.  I don't think that my pours had ever oozed paralyzed before, made tiny rocks of cold that roll rather then run down your flesh.  There is salt in my eye brows.  Who shaved my head?  I am beginning to panic.  Stay calm.  Stay calm.  The candle is on its last legs, and I have a sneaking suspicion that once the candle is gone, the power to remember the outside world will be too.  I have to write on my lap with the candle wax running onto the floor and burning my ass now.  The walls have closed in so that I cant flex my legs, or stand, or feel.  There is only a centimeter from my head to the steal.  I wish there was water.  I am sucking on a few of my wax creatures to keep my mouth wet, not that it matters.  They were sacrifices to me, to my will.  Thank you god of light for letting me believe in the smallness of reality- only to the light- only to the edge of the dark.    the candle is flickering, and I can only assume that no one has gotten my messages.  The many I sent.  Maybe they are reading my mail.  I just want to say, before it is dark forever and me and my creations are crushed into the wiring of my computer, I just want to s
