So the rest of my fall break is ruined by band, but what do you expect. Ehh...contests actually aren't all too bad. I got Fazoli's after practice today, so that made me happy. Yumm...I love their breadsticks so much. Yeah, so my computer just went psycho. I'm going to publish this post before it decides to freeze up.  Have a nice day everyone.
