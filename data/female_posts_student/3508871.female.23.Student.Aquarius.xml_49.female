Pretending that I was in a good shape but actually....I felt very quizzy after taking off...yeah, motion sickness.but thank goodness I did not do what I am not suppose to....p*ke. It was definitely an amazing experience, just to be able to see such wonderful view of Hood River from the top. For the rest please check out  urlLink Travis'Blog
