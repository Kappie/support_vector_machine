That person will alway stay perfect? Haha.. Most probably ba.. Was talking abt secretly admiring someone.. Haha.. Sometimes.. really regret things when thought of that.. Really feel that life seems so perfect yet i feel so empty inside.. What am i going through now? I remembered reading a book saying.. its good to be waiting..u may feel disappointed in the end.. But at least there's something for u be worth waiting and feeling disappointed.. Haha.. so true yet so.. Hahaha.. i hate waiting.. i dun like waiting.. I hate the feeling of disappointment.. Hahahaa..
