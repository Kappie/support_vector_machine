(I can't believe I'm posting this for the whole world to see)  That's right, 5 weeks ago i decided i'm going to do something drastic about my weight problem.  I've joined Jenny Craig... so.. if you ever have wondered why i munch on raisins in lit and comp, or am constantly eating carrots and drinking diet snapples and unsweetened Ice tea... there you have it.  In the first three weeks i lost 7.5 lbs... and that's mostly from changing my diet.  Once i start working out regularly, things will start to even off or even slow but hopefully the loss will be constant.  I'm not starving or on vegatables only, i'm better fed right now than i have probably EVER been... last night i had turkey and mashed potatoes, tonight i had a personal pizza and tomorrow is chicken.  Last week when i weighed in, i hadn't lost anything (easter break issues no doubt) so i'm hoping tomorrow's appointment will have better results.  Yep, so thank you for the support from everyone that has known so far, and i hope that those reading this will be just as supportive of my decision to finally take charge of my own life.
