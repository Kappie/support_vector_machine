I am unsure of what shampoo she uses, the smell is driving me insane, I think I am going to go and try and cut off my nose if it doesn't go away soon, it probably doesn't help that I am still wearing the same clothes from yesterday either.Thatstill doesn't say much for Georgia though, if the smell is thatstrongthat it can become intertwined with the fibers of my shirt, says that you could definitely smell her from a mile away. I can only say this: Georgia stop smelling so much, it's not that it is a bad smell, it's just that after smelling it for 12 hours straight you start to go a little crazy.
