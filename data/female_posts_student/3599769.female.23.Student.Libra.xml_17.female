Watched a bunch of useless t.v., gabbed on the phone. Very woe is me.   Tonights mission is to clean up the apt. I keep saying that but haven't actually gotten around to doing it. What fun. On a Friday nite. Ah, Phooey. I wish that workday time would whizz by, and then slow a little when I drive home. Traffic's gonna be a bitch.   My horoscope (all 50 of them that I read on a daily basis) say I need to stop reminiscing and focus on the now. Pfft. Easy for them to say, but I will try fervently to take this advice. So heres to looking at the now. And trying to appreciate it.   Why is it that noone's blogging incessently? don't you know that I live to look at other peoples blogs? c'mion bloggers BLOG. If for anything, for this lonely girl to say busy without letting her mind wander into the past.
