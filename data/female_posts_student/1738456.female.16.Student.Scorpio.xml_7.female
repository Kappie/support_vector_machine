There was a faint humming noise coming from my room too, and as I got closer, it intensified. Slowly, with each step, I began to distinguish different songs in the jumbled up mess that was the noise. But the closer I got, the faster they got, until all I could hear was screeching. As soon as I was in my room, I noticed that the screeching was coming from the flower-shaped rugs on my floor.  “I’m insane, this is insane…I’m crazy. No I’m dreaming…” I tried to calm myself down, it wasn’t working, and the noises weren’t helping. I covered my ears to drown out the noise, and tried to walk backwards out of my room. Any movements I made just made the noise worse, I was weighted to the floor, and if I took one more step, I was sure I was going to explode.  “STOP IT!” I screamed shutting my eyes as tightly as they would close. The notes danced across my eyelids turning cartwheels and flip-flops. I stared entranced at their gracefulness, and then I noticed that the noise had stopped. My eyes flew open. There, sitting on my window seat, was what appeared to be a bum. He looked as if he wasn’t any taller than my hip, and his skin was a dark chocolate. He had long dreadlocks, and a perfectly shaped goatee. His clothes were green, brown, and baggy; they looked like they hadn’t been washed in ages, and the fact that they were the color of dirt didn’t help much either. His eyes were closed and there was a quiet bubbling noise in the room as he inhaled smoke from his glossy, green bong.  “Stop what?” He asked me calmly when he finished, looking up at me from behind a pair of thick-rimmed, square shaped glasses.   “Who the fuck are you?” I asked staring at him my eyes as wide as they would go.  “No my friend, the question is who do you think I am,” he stood up and walked towards me. “You see, a wise man once said, ‘The way we imagine ourselves to appear to another person is an essential element in our conception of ourselves. In other words, I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.’” I looked down at him stunned, was this thing really talking to me? I had no idea what the hell was going on.  “You are clearly a figment of my imagination, I’m dreaming. I have to be…I’ll wake up, and this will all be over. Because you’re not real, and my rugs aren’t singing. This is obviously a really weird dream,” I rationalized. I sat down and leaned my head against my dresser, covering my head with my hands.  “If that’s what you think,” he walked over to my big comfy chair and sat down in it. The chair engulfed his tiny-ness. He inhaled again, and blew the smoke out the nose. It curled up underneath and drew shadows in the air. A bird appeared and flew through my window. “I think you are just scared. Relax, breathe, feel the air, and realize what you came here to do. What is your purpose?” I stared at the ground for a long time as I breathed in deeply, why was I listening to this, this leprechaun? However, the breathing was relaxing me, maybe it was the smoke, and maybe it wasn’t, but I was calming down.  “My purpose,” I said with a sigh, “is to finish my English paper,” I stared at my computer screen. There were flying toasters on it, which I knew wasn’t my screen saver. One of the pieces of toast buttered itself and jumped in the toaster. Another hopped into a pot of jam. I shook my head and looked at the leprechaun, whom I had decided to call Bob. “I’m obviously not going to be able to do that now, because my computer has gone insane too.”  “Do you think you’re insane?”  “Yes.”  “Well I don’t think you’re insane, this is all very real.”  “Real compared to what? This is nothing but a dream! And you’re nothing but a leprechaun in my head.”  “Well I’m not in your head. I seem to be sitting on a rather comfortable chair,” he blew a ring of smoke at me. It crowned itself on my head. I shook my head in an effort to remove it, and stared at him.  “Well if you’re real, why are you here, in my room, talking to me?”  “To help you realize your path. You have something that needs completing, and if it’s not done soon, you’ll end up like me my friend.”  “Like you?” I snorted, and the crown jumped, “A poor, destitute, cracked out, leprechaun giving people advice they didn’t ask for.”  “Don’t play games. This is no laughing matter. Stand up!” Something in his voice made me jump to my feet. I stood rigid waiting for him to tell me what to do. “Think hard, my friend, what is it you need the most?”  “An explanation.”  “Of what?”  “Of you.”  “I am of no concern,” he blew smoke out the side of his mouth, it curled up to the ceiling as if he was a chimney.  “How can I trust you then?”  “My story is quite simple. I had a path too, except I wandered off. Tricked by a dumb white rabbit. I ended up like this. Now unless you want to end up giving people advice they don’t ask for the rest of your life, I suggest you listen,” he stared at me, inhaling more. I stared back waiting for him to speak again. Years flew by in time. Hours twirled around minutes, making them seem longer. My internal clock stopped.  “Listen to what?” I asked. He held his finger to his lips.  “Shhh, to your heart,” he closed his eyes. I followed suit.  “Love,” came a deep, resounding voice from my chest. It rang aloud enough for the world to hear.  “What?” I asked, “What does that mean?”  “It means that by 11:45 if you have not found the one you love, and told him so, you’ll take my place. Forever,” he blew smoke at me creating a wall between the two of us.  As soon as the smoke cleared, I looked back at the place where my leprechaun had been sitting, he was gone.  “Hello?” I asked weakly. “Shit, what am I supposed to do now?” I sank back down and then immediately jumped back up. “Hey, wait a minute! 11:45? Even Cinderella got until midnight!” 	  His voice called out to me in laugher “Yes, but this isn’t a fairy tale my friend, this is real.”  “What am I supposed to do?” I asked the room. His voice answered me again, except this time fading softly.  “Find the path, follow your heart…”
