TV:  Channel surf, or always know what you're gonna watch?   I do my fair share of channel surfing.  3.   Jazz:  Big band or Davis/Monk era jazz?   I prefer big band, but I like it all!  :-D  4.   Text books:  Sell them back or keep them so you have an interesting 'library' someday?   I plan on keeping them... mostly (for me) because I may need reference to them as a teacher.  5.   Wacky Wednesday:  make suggestions for topics or just partake in the half-assed work of *moi*?   I'd love for people to make suggestions from time to time... sometimes I just get stumped for topics.  Especially recently with all my crazy school-work-sleep schedule.
