For me, it is nice once in a while, but I miss my alone time.  All signs seem to point to a need for me to slow down.  For example, every week in our assignment books, there is always a tidbit of encouraging, but slightly corny advice that I always read.  I took it as a sign that, this week, the random little bit of advice read,  Take some time off to just relax.  Enjoy being alive and do nothing in particular.  Renew your energy.   I gained some respect for the corny advice writers after that one.  They most definitely have a point.  This week is our last week of rehearsals before our parent's performance of Robin Hood on Saturday.  Everything seems to be coming together, however slowly.  More and more, I am enjoying acting as an evil nun.  *grin*  I mean, come on, who wouldn't have fun with that?  At first, I must admit, I wasn't exactly digging the garb I am required to don, but people adjust, as I did.  Now, the excitement I had for Little Shop is beginning to sink in for this show too.  I love the feeling of working with all my closest friends to create something that we can all be proud of.  Until next time, mis mapaches locos (my crazy raccoons).  I leave you with a vocabulary word.  (Yes, I am a dork.)  (Parenthetical notes are fun.)  ((Especially when you use two parenthesis.))  (((Or three...)))   jejune  (adj.) -- lacking in interest or substance; immature, juvenile
