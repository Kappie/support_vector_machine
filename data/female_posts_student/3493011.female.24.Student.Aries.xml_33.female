I've so much wrk to do but my body seems to be functioning slower these days.. juz yesterday I clocked up more than 12 hrs of sleep but waking up intermittently to snooze my alarm and turning the water heater on... Amazing rite, I was amused myself too...  I hav heaps of stuff to do and I can sense this mounting fear inside me..but my body wrks in a farnie manner: when I fear, I feel sleepy..hee hee as the saying goes, "sleep over your problems" I adhere to that and I give a BIG nod to that.. The weather doesn't help abit..and it's freezing rite now... seems like gradually decreasing in temperature..I can't wait for Winter to be over..   Holidays are bad.. I tend to shop more and eat-out more... my bank account seems to be plummeting with little input.. I told myself that I gotta save but so far urm... seems unlikely.. I try hard to restraint myself frm going grocery shopping becoz I tend to come hme with more than the singular item which I intended to purchase... now my fridge is well-stock up and so is my pantry and of coz my snack corner.. thus, the extra pound that I've put on... This is complusive excessive buying disorder, in short, spendthrift!! There are certain things that I need like a new heater (currently using Terence's), a new mobile (the antenna for the mobile has been ripped out), a new toilet seat cover (don't ask me abt it ok) and let me see what else... hmm... But really I wanna set aside some marnie so that when Terence comes back, we can go out for nice meals and probably go for "The Impressionist" art collection viewing, performances and maybe a short trip to somewhere... I also want to set aside some marnie for my mum and aunt...so that at the end of the year when they come for my convo.. I can provide them some spending marnie or even foot the bill for meals... I wanna give some back to them and allow them to enjoy their stay here.. That's my greatest wish rite now.. I miss everyone so much...    God teach me how to spend my marnie wisely this holiday
