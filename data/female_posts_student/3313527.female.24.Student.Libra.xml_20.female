I feel completely disconnected from myself- walking around in a haze- feels like my spirit is hovering somewhere just slightly outside of my body, like I'm not really present in anything I'm doing. Eyes slightly glazed over and prone to staring blankly, no thoughts. It's funny how someone can have so few thoughts and still be so depressed. I guess when the thoughts that do wander through are bitter, angry and negative, it doesn't take many to wreck a mood.   The best way I can think of to describe this feeling is to say that I feel deprived. A sensory deprivation booth. I feel deprived of friendship, connection and joy. I feel disconnected from the free expression of love and empathy. I feel unknown even to those who know me best. I feel deprived of material comfort and the sense of identity these things can sometimes bring (ie a nice haircut, a few new pieces of clothing bought firsthand for a change, can help me feel like I'm actually embodying who I am inside on the outside). Deprived of the financial means to have basic needs met- ie, halfway decent healthy food from the health food store (or at least health food aisle)- fresh vegetables instead of frozen- et al.-- Getting the car repairs I need to feel safe driving. I feel poor. Which isn't too far from reality at this point. What a shame to waste some of the best years of my life (while I'm still young and have my health and some amount of vigor and lack of concern for repercussions) too utterly broke to enjoy myself.  Obviously I am lucky and blessed in so many ways. But today I choose not to see those things, and instead see all of the things I really want or need, things that I am trying to pursue or work to have but are painfully just out of reach, and feel frustrated and empty.  God, amidst the much and slime of existence, I long to see  your  face, to enter the kingdom, to put it in christian terms. The briefest moment of true union with Spirit would probably ease all of this struggle.
