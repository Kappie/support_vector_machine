This morning in the 63 bus, there were a bunch of students from outram sec and they were standing on the pathment of ther bus. When i have reach my stop, i walked to the door to get down. Then those idots is like an ailen, dun understand wat i say" Excuse me!". Then finally is the worst and ever stupid guy i ever met. He was standing infront of the door and his right hand was like holding on to the pole. When i was infront of him, i say excuse me as i need to get down and he is blocking me. I say 4 times " Excuse me!!!" and his hand is like keep on holding on the pole. I was so angry tat i shouted at him and the stupid bus driver closed the door and drive a little bit futher of the bus stop. I keep pressing the bell and he was like DEAF!  My sister shouted to him and everyone is looking. When the stupid guy finally let go his hand and as i walk down the stairs i say something which is " FUCK YOu ". I really cant stand it. How come got this type of students who is like so inconsiderate. Stupid school got stupid students. I ...... hope this will not happen on me again or else i will really go mad. haix... she was standing there laughing and i thought she talk to me so i also talk back to her. And i realise she is talking to my sister. So malu!!!! Fine, sharon say something abt her today and i dun remeber liao. I dun noe wat to do and i just wish to forget everything as it is so pain and tired. Really.....
