First she invites herself to sit with us, and then Izzy says about going to sit with Emma cause she was all alone and *Flob* was like "Oh well, ok I don't really like her" so she took Izzy's seat! Then she goes and starts bugging me about pratically letting her copy my homework which I spent hours on, and I said no so she started saying "I'll pay you money." I'm sorry but I'm not some kind of whore you know. Well ok, I know she wasn't asking for that, but their's no way I'll do any thing for money and it just pisses me off when some one tries it on me. (Can I breathe now?) NO! Any way, sorry, ok breathe moral rant over! (*Inhales deeply*) Ahh, better. Any hoo I think I need Saturday!!! I NEED SATURDAY! Hey can some one contact the calender guy and ask him to change tomorrow from a Thursday to a Saturday, because I want Saturday and we have a load of homework for Thursday!!! Oooh, and England drew 0 - 0 which means that we're going through! But we've only scored 2 goals so far and the next thing's a knock-out thing so we might not get very far. Score more goals! Go England!
