Police were lurking about everywhere and wouldn't leave us innocent stoners alone. So I skipped 6th period and walked home instead. I was crossing a rather busy street with Alice when a huge fright truck pulled up next to us. In the cab sat the most stereotypical white trash trucker I had ever seen. He stared at me a bit, looked me up and down and gave me a creepy leering smile. All I could think was "Aww shit.." Alice started to walk in front of his truck so I followed her. When I was exactly in front of his truck he fucking spun his tires. I was just walking and all of a sudden *VROOM SCREECH* I jumped halfway across the road. He just started laughing, when I turned around he was lighting a cigarette and waving me over to his truck. I just gave the asshole the finger and walked off. Fucking idiot...  I was walking down the hallway in my house at about midnight yesterday. I glanced at the window that looks out over our driveway and noticed a flash of movement. So I walked over to the window and saw the most amusing sight ever. A man was riding a bicycle up and down our driveway, at 12Am, and he was talking to himself. So I opened the window a bit, sure enough, the man was holding a conversation with himself, in my driveway. The voice sounded REALLY familiar but I couldn't see who it was because I wasn't wearing my contacts. So I ran to get my old glasses from my room and when I came back I got the shock of my life. IT WAS T! My hot neighbor, evidently he was stoned but I could not stop laughing. Good lord!  I had to take my math final today, Ms.B set up our desks so we had a lot of private space. My desk was facing the windows looking out over the front street. I was watching the traffic and everything. The special ed teachers were leading a troop of special kids down the front street. All of a sudden one of the retarded kids attacked another, they were rolling screaming and hitting each other in the street. Tracy was sitting behind me and started screaming "OH MY GOD! Everybody! Quick, the retards are fighting!" So, of course everybody ran to the windows. Ms. B went into a fit. It was great, we didn't finish the final until extremely late though.  I forgot to return a $90 dollar text book... I feel like such an idiot, I have to run it over tomorrow or they won't release my grades. Fuck.   It is officially summer now. Finally, I get to sleep! I lurve summer!
