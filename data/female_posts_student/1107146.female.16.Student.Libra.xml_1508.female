Anyway, um, if anyone wants to help out at the soup kitchen July 15 give me a call.  We need help, so if you can make it, yay!!!  Camp still the same only now it's pouring the rain. :(  I think we'll live though.  Volleyball tourney's probably canceled though. :)  That makes me happy. Now I don't have to go pretend to be excited.  All right, talk to yall later.
