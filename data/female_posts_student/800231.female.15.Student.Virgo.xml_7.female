How did my schedule change fours times in a matter of 3 hours?! As I told Lucia last year, there's definitely a note in my records somewhere that reads "Drive her insane, it's easy and hours of fun!". Jeeze, it took me 20 minutes after school just to get a bloody appointment with my counselor for tomorrow. Plus, during mentorship this morning I got some random letter from the principal. Get this, my mum has signed me up for a UW study. Apparently it's on how "High School affects people socially and emotionally". Somehow I don't think I was the best person to choose for this study... I was already insane, this place does nothing for me. I spent the last three years in the most bizarre situation possible (i.e. my middle school).   People keep telling me I have to dress up for the Martin Luther King Jr. Assembly tomorrow.  Why exactly would I dress up for an assembly? I know, respect MLK and all but still, the tux's the seniors have to wear are seriously overkill. It's in the  GYM  for gods sake! Besides, I dress well enough, it's not like I'm walking around in ripped jeans or anything.  The finals next week sound hideous. We only have 3 classes a day, but each class is over two hours. Plus we have a tutorial period in the morning and afternoon which is basically free time. It's supposed to be for studying or asking for help from teachers but Ms. Davis says we can just go home instead. I rather think I'll go for that option.
