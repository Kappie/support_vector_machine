I haven't been to WBP in a long time--it was good to pray corporately and individually. I felt embarassed when I got home about an hour ago and I looked in the mirror and realized that I probably shouldn't have worn a skirt this short to church.  It's not like my butt's hanging out of the bottom of my skirt or anything, but the hemline is at my fingertips--or just below.  I guess that's kinda a lot of leg to show at a prayer meeting, eh?  Okay, there won't be a next time.  We sent of Stephen, who is leaving for China in the morning.  I didn't realize that he was leaving so soon or I would have submitted my prayer card to him sooner.  Right now it's sitting on my desk with a stamp on it.  I guess I won't be mailing it after all.    So back to Jamie...we talked a lot about boys and she told me what she's been learning from the books she's been reading about dating.  She's planning on reading 4 of them!  Personally, I think she'd be better off reading the Bible rather than these books, but they seem to be helping her nonetheless.  It's amazing how quickly she's "recovered" from this, although they weren't offically dating I guess.  She was a total mess only 2 weeks ago and now she's really happy.  I just kept thinking that God uses these little tragedies to bring us back to Him.  Jamie was pretty lukewarm spiritually, but now she says she has to cling onto God and constantly pray that He would guard her heart against a new man too quickly.  She's been journaling and she actually has spiritual goals for herself, which I think is amazing coming from her.    The sage continues with trying to get to Oregon during the summer.  Sometimes I wonder when we've reached the point of trying to hard or if it's okay to be persistent.  B and I have always said (also in the context of our relationship), that we shouldn't try to force things.  If we encounter too many red lights, then we should just let it go.  I thought that the high ticket prices were red lights, but B called tonight and said he had some news about flying to Oregon.  I didn't get a chance to talk to him b/c I got home too late but I'm eager to hear what he has to say.  Trying not to get my hopes up again...  Dunno whether I should talk to M  D about going up to Oregon.  I have a feeling they're going to not be agreeable to that....I can't wish that they were any different than they are now, but being so conservative/traditional makes dating harder.  They are so protective of me, but I try not to resent that (I'm not trying very hard).  My tendency is to do what I want and then tell them about my plans later.  That doesn't go over very well with Mom b/c she feels like I'm excluding her from my life. Maybe I am to some degree in my quest for independence, but it's more that I'm afraid that she'll say "no" if I ask her permission.  Ben has something up his nose and he keeps sneezing.  He hasn't been his usual self cuz he hasn't been bothering Cheese lately.  Hopefully he'll sneeze out whatever it is or it'll be $$$ for a rhinoscopy. Maybe he can hold out until July when my professional courtesy renews or maybe I can sneak him into the clinic during my IM rotation next week and do the rhinoscopy myself w/ Dr. Johnson (aka. Respiratory Queen) present.  Poor Ben Ben.  Well, this is a good learning experience for me since we just had our final on respiratory diseases.  Tiffany and I were going through a list of differentials and trying to localize the disease to the nose just like we learned in class.  It's kinda cool that we actually get to apply what we're learning.  It makes the material seem much less theoretical.    Well, busy day tomorrow so I'd better be going to bed.  I'm trying to maximize my 4 days of vacation by hanging out with people, so it'll be a fun kind of business.
