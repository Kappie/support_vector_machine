I felt really gross this morning too, then I was happy, now I'm blah. Uckyful feelings. *Sigh* So many things to think about, so many opportunities slipped past me...Feels like I've been flipped upside down, shaken for all I'm worth and have just been set upright again. Trying to find your bearings is hard, especially at this age. I mean there's so many things that stand in your way nowadays. So much easier when we were little...Lol I sound so serious, this isn't like me! Maybe I'm talking about this because I watched a certain movie on the weekend about not wanting to growing up  flying away to Neverland...I do admit, there's advantages and disadvantages, but I still don't like the thought of it. So many mixed feelings to sort out. Why should I have to go through this? It's waaay too complicated for my liking. Guess it's just part of the "grand design"...(Think I've been reading too many fantasy books ^^') Arrrgh I'm too naive with the ways of the world. Wish I wasn't so much, I'd be so much easier to adjust with certain things. I'm walking a path in the dark it seems like. I don't know where I'm going, tripping and trying to get back up. Exhausted and bruised, struggling to overcome obstacles I can't see until they hit me square in the face...Just a little insight on the way I feel sometimes. I'm oblivious and point out the obvious. Classic combo for an idiot, eh? I'm so clueless sometimes...Well, guess this is all I can write for now,(kinda drained, you know how it is) I'll write in here a little later.
