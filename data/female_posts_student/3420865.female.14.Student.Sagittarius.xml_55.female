(seriously.) then we went to see the notebook...we got in the theatre and there were like  no  seats left. so we had to sit right at the front...and it was really close. and we had to look up to see the movie...and my neck hurts. it was sweet though.  ok so the movie was one of the best movies i've ever seen...really. wow i cried at the end...actually, no. cried is an understatement. i  balled . yeah that's right...me, lana, and sofija cried SO hard... it was so cool. then after the movie, we went to tim horton's to get me a bottle of water (because now i was dying of a headache), then they left me and i took the bus home.  "lana, shut up."-me and sofija, every time lana talked during the movie. which was like...3742 times.  "why is it taking her so long?"-sofija. you really have to see the movie/had to be there.  "lana, stop eating her food! she's starving! lana, stop! i'm being serious...lana!"-sofija.  it's funny cuz i had to call my dad before i got on the bus that takes me downtown, then i had to call him when i got downtown, then i had to call him when i got off the bus and was walking to our house. only cuz it was like 10:30 at night...anywho.  and now here i am...tonight was sweet. but, i shall miss you lana, my love. i do hope you have a smashing time in yugoslavia...i'm sure you will.   don't try to be cute with me,  cuz i know you hate yourself.  kayte.
