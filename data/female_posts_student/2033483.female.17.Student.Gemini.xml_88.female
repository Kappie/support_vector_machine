I know, I thought that was a lot, too. ;-) But anyway on to the real reason I'm posting, to tell you about my b-day supper with my homies...no that doesn't work...my friends.  I met Megan, Logan and Renae at Bennigans.  Alisha and Jessica could not make it because they were out of town so oh well to them.  But I just kinda knew that Justin would be our waiter, I don't know, maybe I'm physic?  Well he was.  I will say this about Justin I've always thought he was a nice guy but ever since he cut his hair...whoa, all that hair was hiding him.  He's really hot.  But back to me, they made me go to the bathroom so they could tell Justin it was my birthday and I wouldn't feel weird about it.  Nothing like standing in a bathroom with nothing to do.  He came with a really big brownie that was yummy!  Of course he had to announce it to the entire restaurant, but he didn't sing so I was thankful.  However the table of literally 22 people brought it upon themselves to sing to me.  So that was really sweet and Renae and I thanked them before leaving.  I must say we were all really good tippers too.  Justin made $20 off of us tonight.  So two days before birthday was really good.  Thanks you guys for coming and eating with me and buying me a present which wasn't necessary.   Luv ya, Kayla  P.S. Megan, if you want to leave a comment on the other one I'll still get it so don't hesitate! Hope your Grandma gets better soon!
