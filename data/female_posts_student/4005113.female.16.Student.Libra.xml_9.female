    
       I'd like to start out by saying that the sole idea behind this blog is to keep our group of friends in contact. Many of us are moving away and moving on to different phases of our lives. I don't want to drift away from all of you whom I have been so close to.  Even if we aren't able to see each other as much as we'd like, at least we can read about what's going on in each other's lives. Please take the time to post whatever is going on in your life here. It is also a place for your opinions, discussion, and creative writing. Celebrate free speech, everybody! Have fun!
