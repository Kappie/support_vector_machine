Searching for the land beyond  Where ageless beauty  Rises with each dawn.  The home of the present  The home of the past  All gathering round  The Tor stone's path.  Hands clasped in ritual  Hearts singing with praise  For the Goddess  And her wondrous ways.  Laying dormant within our hearts  Is the land that time forgot,  Where cloaked maidens  Dance through the night  And hearth fire's burn  Big and bright.  Where robes are worn  To show your place  Among the women  Who spend their days  Steeped in knowledge  Passed from the realm  Where faeries frolic  And time stands still.  Avalon is home to those  Who worship the Goddess  And all she knows.
