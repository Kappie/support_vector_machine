Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You become a part of me Let us plant the seed, and watch it grow Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You’d become a part of me  As we travel down the road Side by side we’d share the load Hand in hand we’ll see each other through Though we’ve only just begun Let’s count our blessings one by one I thank God for that, I thank God for you.  Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You become a part of me Let us plant the seed and watch it grow Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You become a part of me..ooohh  As the seasons slip away, forever lover’s we will stay Together, do or die, all our hearts.  Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You become a part of me Let us plant the seed and watch it grow Love’s grown deep, deep into the heart of me You become a part of me…
