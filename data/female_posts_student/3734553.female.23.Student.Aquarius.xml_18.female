The more I read, the more I realize, that I love the words more than I love the stories.  If that makes sense.  Read something by Milan Kundera and you might understand what I mean.  Most people love “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.”  But “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting” is my favorite.  The story is strange and rather confusing, at several points I had no idea what was going on.  But every few paragraphs he presents an idea, an idea that is simple but seems ornate because of the wording.  I know I am strange and weird and all those other things that usually keep people away. But I am sure that at some point in most everyone’s life they have read or heard something that made them feel understood, or represented, or not alone.  When I was younger I always said that my dream job was to help people find their “perfect book.”  The book that gives them that indescribable feeling.  Last summer, right after I moved to Austin, I read Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road.”  When the narrator is describing himself and his friends, I saw myself in the words.  I wrote out that page and had it on my fridge the entire time I lived in Austin.  It was one of the last things to be packed.  “But then they danced down the street like dingledoodies, and I shambled after as I’ve been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a common place thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes “Awww!””  that is how I feel sometimes.  Like I am trying to keep up with everyone around me, and we are all rushing towards a beautiful but tragic ending.  I watch those around me, and I question my abilities while admiring theirs.  And in my mind other people come to be characterized by the quote I associate them with in my black books.  Krysten – “All the time-no matter what she was doing-there was music.  Sometimes she hummed to herself as she walked, and other times she listened quietly to the songs inside her.”  And Wayne – “I would like, as you see, to convince myself that my pleasure in your response is not plain vanity but the pleasure of being heard, the pleasure of companionship, which seems more honorable.”  And then there are song lyrics.  But that is another post, for another time.
