He's having problems with Dennis so it sucks a lot, I hope things have worked out for him. My mom made me go through all of my clothes and find stuff that didn't fit or I didn't like. It took 4 hours to get through all my dumb clothes. But now I have space for more so that's a plus. I'm going shopping tomorrow. I thought for a while and I don't know I really want things to be back the way they are because all I do is reminisce the good times and regret my mistakes but I know she needs time right now, she has lot of shit going on so I can't go talk to her just yet...Anyways then I went to work. It was kinda busy but for some reason, I didn't leave till 10 when I was supposed to leave at 8 so I guess everyone else thought it was busy. Lissa and I were gonna hang out but she had a tummy ache so we rainchecked. Ana came over for like 10 min. when I got home. We jsut sat out in my backyard before Jorge came to pick her up. I hope she's happy with him, I know she is. Cuz even tho she's mean 2 him, it shows she cares about him cuz usually she doesn't relaly give a crap lol. I'm going to end this right now because I"m talking to someone online..I might write later, not now..
