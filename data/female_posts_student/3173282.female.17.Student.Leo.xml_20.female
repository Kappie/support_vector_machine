I finally got to sleep at 7! yay! haha and it felt sooo good after walking around all night. We waited in the line for Storm Runner for 2 hours, and i did not get to enjoy the ride because the whole time i thought ben was going to puke all over me so i was scared as shit. Hmm...some other fun things were the pirate ship Arrr, bumper cars at 3 AM, "rock music" ahahaha, and playing 4 square cuz we were sooo bored. Rachel took me home in the morning and told me some very funny stories about all the thugs that were there. Seriously, there were so many black gangstas there...and they would cut in line for every ride. But anyway, Rachel was sleeping on a bench and this big black girl came up to her and screamed in her face n woke her up! Why do they have to be so annoying. And it doesn't help that alot of our school is racist haha sooo it was funny. Anyway, i think i'll go back to sleep then i have my choir concert. Dont even think about going because its going to be hideous. Byebye! -And if you never stop when you wave goodbye, you just might find if you give it time, You just might wave hello again, you just might wave hello again. And that's the way this wheel keeps working now-
