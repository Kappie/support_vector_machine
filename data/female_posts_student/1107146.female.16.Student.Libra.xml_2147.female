And my sis can cover the frosh (under my influence of course, this is "let's overexaggerate Josh so he can transfer his sway to Linds's campaign"). And the juniors, I'll get the ones you miss and what not.  Your campaign slogan should be..."Lindsey Reid...it rhymes with seed." heheh Or, "Lindsey Reid, I have guns, and I'm willing to share!" I'm sure the psychos will love you. Or "Don't be a feeb, vote Lindsey Reid!" hahah, I laughed out loud on that one and one of the Mexican dudes (I'm at Glen's) came and asked if I was alright. I   I'm gay...April Fools. Either that, or the EMO is getting to me...and it'll be finished Friday so stay tuned.  Is it just me or do I smell snow outside? Wasn't it just spring a couple days ago? Stupid Mother Nature.
