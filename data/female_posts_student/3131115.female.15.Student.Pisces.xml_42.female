I also failed my Earth Science Regents so I have to go take that August 17th. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail it again, because I suck at Science. I dont know how to study. Grr...oh yeah, and I also failed Studio Art. So, I'm still a freshman until January. I hate school, but I plan on doing good next year, hopefully. Anyway, I have to go because I'm going to Bills house to paint today...just thought I'd update on school. :-/
