Tomorrow and Monday I start finals, which detracts from them being normal days.  Schedule from Friday on: Friday - Final 7:30-8:30, normal day WEEKEND (Saturday is a fund raiser with Lego Maniacs, maybe...)  Monday - Normal class, Final 8:34-9:34, normal day Tuesday - Final from 7:45-9:45, home Wednesday - Final from 10:00 - 12:00. home Thursday - Final from 7:45-9:45, final from 10:00-12:00 Friday - Leaving for Worcester probably about 10:00AM :-D  Last night Dave e-mailed me and contacted Tony about heading up the meeting which I finally got to do fully :-D  I walked to John's house, got the keys, then walked the rest of the way to the meeting where Tony, Frank, and I chilled outside and played a bit of frisbee while joking with some kids on the other side of the parking lot lol. I think the girls were hitting on Tony lol, because his kick ass car. Too bad he's 24 (4 right?) and they were in middle school lol.  The meeting was quick and I got a ride home. While dropping off the keys Stanhope ran up and told me I probably got more done than Dave :-X lol  Today:  English: Watched Macbeth  Contemporary: Did Spanish project  Study: Wrote a letter to people that I will probably never send :- Spanish: Slept a bit  Chemistry: Took over a lab, fun stuff  Precalculus: Slept, discovered that I will be taking that final not next Wednesday as planned, which would leave me more study time, but TOMORROW...from 7:30AM to 8:30AM! Then again on Monday, 8:34AM-9:34AM!!! Ack!  Then I got my summer assignments for my English 111 course. I need to check some text books out for the summer. A full year...like...365 days with those books ahead :-\   I am a sick human being, I am looking forward to it! Reading some classics, like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte (as I have already done), short stories, essays, poems, and then writing my own essays. I feel like this course is going to be very good for me :-D College work! College freshmen course :-D  Damnit, which means all of those UCONN things I avoided on that CT thing count towards me. This course if a collaboration with UCONN and counts for credit there. Oops.  Stayed after with Pease. At least Chemistry is all cleared up.  Tonight I get to drive for two whole hours. I am helping teach a course tonight in Tunxis. How do you spell that anyways? Well, that. One hour up, one hour back. Fun stuff. Practice for driving for long periods of time this summer lol  Speaking of, that letter I wrote n'such were all in regards to one situation that has put ice in my gut all day. I realize that Tycho was getting in trouble to the phone last night and I hope that I did not tick his rents off for keeping him on the phone for so long. I have been wicked worried, I do not want him or his rents POed at me. :-( I hope to contact him at some point today.  That was a huge part of what was on my mind today, that and missing him.  Well, I have to go in a few. Talk to y'all later!  -J9
