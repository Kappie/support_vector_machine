We went to Zurich with Katja (one of my summerjob mates, who's still here) and walked around and I had to buy some warm clothes. Once again we were amazed of the lack of service oriented people in the shops. I went to pay my stuff in H on the Bahnhofstrasse and I guess she didn't even look at me properly. Instead she concentrated on blabbering with her colleagues and as soon as I had paid and still gathered my stuff together, was she gone. No "Byebye", "Have a nice day" whatsoever. And the same in Manor on Bahnhofstrasse. And I have thought, that service in Finnland is not that good;) But then Katja told me, that there has been researches that have proved that the level of Finnish service is really good in comparison with other countries. \o/ I guess that's why we were so popular waitresses in the labour camp...erm...Hotel Rhodannenberg. The guests said direct to us, that we were so friendly and everything and at least I got personal Trinkgeld more than once.  So, we demand SERVICE!=) It feels so SILLY, if the customers (in this case me and Katja) are friendlier to the clerks than they are to the customer.   Then we went to eat pasta and have a glass of wine. Soon we noticed that it's getting late and I should go shopping (forgot my housewife function completely!;), since the fridge was practically empty. When we came out from Coop and headed towards the main railwaystation, a man looked at us a bit longer. I thought it was just because we're speaking an odd language and not particularly quiet. We're already used to that. But a couple of minutes later two other people looked at us a bit longer and then to our great surprise said "Hello" and "Good Evening" in Finnish! We were quite amazed and I kept on thinking over, what we were talking about;) There are so few finnish people here, that we can normally talk whatever we want;) I wanted to talk more to them, but they just walked on and merely looked at us once again a bit longer. I bet they were tourists! Or just stereotypical finnish people;) I keep on forgetting that I'm NOT a typical finn.  Today...  My father just called me to wish me a happy nameday (today is Ilona's day). I was so happy, that he called and already early in the morning I got an sms from him. But he had also bad news. He has a deadly disease since 1996 and it has been ok and could've been taken care of with medicines. For the last 20 months he had no medication at all. But now it's gone worse (the helper cells are getting weaker and fewer) and he needs an injection and a heap of pills. Shit. I'm so worried about him and here I am, not being able to visit him easily. I just have to hope and pray. THIS is one of the worse things in living abroad...   So, I guess this is not gonna be a good day after all.  I listen to Muse and try to pep myself up, I'd still have to work today. Although all I really hope is that the hours would pass by and my honey would come home and take me into his arms again. At the moment it feels like the best thing in this world...when he holds me and strokes my hair and gives little kisses. In that moment I feel I'm really safe. The warmth he gives is amazing.  Come away with me in the night Come away with me And I will write you a song  Come away with me on a bus Come away with me where they can't tempt us With their lies  I want to walk with you On a cloudy day In fields where the yellow grass grows knee kigh So won't you try to come  Come away with me and we'll kiss On a mountain top Come away with me And I'll never stop loving you  And I want to wake up with the rain Falling on a tin roof While I'm safe there in your arms So all I ask is for you To come away with me in the night Come away with me (Norah Jones)  ---------------------  It's all gonna be alright.
