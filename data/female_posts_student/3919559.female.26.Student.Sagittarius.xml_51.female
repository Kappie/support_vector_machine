I trudged through that grass, diagonally across The Mall, scraping my feet, many times, and though many may have followed behind me, I returned to campus a few years after my graduation to find it paved in UD's glorious and ubiquitous red brick.  I certainly intend to try to claim credit for starting the practice.  UD's own "if-you-build-it-they-will-come" is "If you walk across the grass enough to create even a slightly worn footpath, they will brick it."  Try it, it works.
