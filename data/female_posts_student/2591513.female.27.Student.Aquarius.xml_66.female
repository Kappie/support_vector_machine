I know this is going to come off as me whining and I don't mean it to be, but I AM TIRED.  No, I take that back.  I am exhausted.  There is only one thing I regret in my life and that is finishing my education because now it has to take a back burner to my life.  But I love my children and my family and wouldn't trade them for anything but I feel more and more that they deserve more than what I can give them.  In a couple of weeks I will be interviewed for a scholarship.  I am so flattered and so excited, but know that I will have to tell them that I have taken a medical withdrawal from school.  I am glad I took it because there are a lot of things I need to face that I haven't been facing and on top of that list are my kids.  My mom is raising them and it isn't right.  So I am taking mor eonline classes to be home more and moving to a different school.  I love the school I have been in, but my family has to come first.  The awful thing about moving out here.  I love the house, hate the commute...and well miss being so close to everything.  I see and hear about my friends and they are long done with college and working in their careers and here I am still struggling to get the first half done...what is wrong with me?  Why can't I just be done with it...why can't I just finish a damn semester without having any medical problems?  UGH  I HATE THIS FEELING.  Anyway, I better get back down to schooling Bailey.  Just pray that God shows me the path I need to take.  I feel like I am losing my way.
