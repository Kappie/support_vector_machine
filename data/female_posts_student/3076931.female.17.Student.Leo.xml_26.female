The hippy guy said "I go wherever the breeze takes me, man"  These are the people that make Sundown in the City interesting... Going where the breeze takes them...   Sundown was pretty fun. We were only there for a few hours though...we weren't really feelin' the bluegrass music. After that we ended up in numerous parking lots...Wendy's,Krystals, Wal-Mart, Ingles, St. John's, Weigel's. Yes..Knoxville is such a happening city.  We finally ended up at this guy Bama's house. Where I felt totally uncomfortable. Right as I walked into the rooom, there was an emormous confederate flag hanging on the wall. Yikes. So I just sat for a little while...acting like an awkward, shy little girl. As much fun as I was having sitting around and staring at Bama's collection of Confederacy items, I decided to go home around 1 A.M. And that was when I stayed up until 3 am sitting in my bed and staring at my ceiling and thinking.....  There are times when I feel as though I am so much older than some of my friends...and then I realize I am actually a year older than them. And maybe a year's a year..but a year difference makes a lot.  These girls do things like drink or smoke to make them seem like badasses. And maybe I did go through that phase, but I have grown out of it. I may drink from now and then but not to be like "Oh look at me I drink and smoke weed, I'm such a badass." And kids come on...you took  Caffeine pills .. not SPEED.  I don't know how to put what I'm feeling into words.  I think some people just need to  grow up .   So maybe going with the breeze isn't a good thing. Sometimes you need to turn around and go against the breeze, people. Don't be afraid to be who you are and be something else. Don't get lost in the crowd.
