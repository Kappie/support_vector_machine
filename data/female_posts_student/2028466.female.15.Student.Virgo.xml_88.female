"what are you doing?"  he asked, she looked at him, and shook her head.  "you wouldnt understand."  she then walked a little faster, but the guy kept driving beside her.  "just try telling me" the girl sighed, and stopped. "alright. someone called, and asked if Ridge was home, and i said how was i supposed to know, and then they started lauging, and said, 'is he running' and i looked in the kitchen and said yea, and turned away, and then the person said, 'you better go catch him! he just ran away, he's heading down the street." so then i ran out the door and i've been walking down the street the whole day." the guy looked at her, then laughed. the girl frowned and turned away from him.  "i knew you would laugh! i'll never find Ridge!" the guy shook his head.  "i'm sorry, its just that, if Ridge was running, wouldnt you have to run to catch him?" the girl looked at him, and smiled, but then frowned again. "The only thing i cant figure out though, is how he got out the door, down the steps, and ran down the street!" The guy was puzzled. "well he opened the door, walked down the steps, and then began to run.." he said, now utterly confused. the girl let out another loud sigh. "you Just DON'T understand! Ridge is my grandmother's refrigerator!"     Haha....me so funny....ehehe, i made that up :p lol, its sorta gay actually...
