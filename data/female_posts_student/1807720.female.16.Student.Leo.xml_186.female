People are going to begin to start to think I am trying to starve myself, but my stomach REALLY REALLY hurts right now.  I barely ate anything for dinner and I lied to my Mom about what I had for lunch because all I ate was a granola bar.  I don't want to eat anyways though cause it makes me feel like deadly ill.  Also, my Mom would have freaked out if she knew I just ate a granola bar for lunch, but she doesn't know I am not feeling well.  If I don't tell her, she won't figure it out.  It's not like anyone can do anything about it anyways and I just had a blood test done like a month or less ago and everything was fine.  My stomach really hurts right now, but it's more painful when I stand up and stuff, and like about an hour or half and hour after I eat is usually the worst times.  When I lie down it's not as painful.  I also have to start Summer School soon and I am going to have to go the entire morning there, trying to pay attention and stuff, and it will be so much more difficult if I don't feel well.  To be honest I am kind of afraid to eat.  I don't want to feel sick and I don't want to get fat.  I was 137 a while ago and that's usually the weight I try to maintain, and now I am at 134, which I guess isn't that much weight lost considering I barely eat these days and I work out like 24/7.  I did about an hour and fifteen minutes at the gym this morning.  It felt good to work out, I feel in my legs there is slowly more muscle building up, and at least at the gym you meet people and there are people to socialize with.  I have also noticed an increase in like my level of happiness, I think the self-esteem meter went up to, but that's because when I eat less I feel better about myself.  I feel thinner.  I don't actually really care if it's unhealthy.  I mean maybe this being "sick" or whatever you would call it is a good thing, because I want to be thin and beautiful.  I want to be like everyone else, have a nice body, and just look good.  I don't want to be feeling sick though, but whatever, with time I am sure it will go away.
