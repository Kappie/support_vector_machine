Sorry. *sorry, i'm having a conversation with myself* (...)  What about: Person one - Wanna go back to mine Person two - I don't think two people can fit in your spaceship! Just so I'm not sexist, homaphobic or whatever AARGH! I really should stop digging myself into holes! This planet has got enough already!
