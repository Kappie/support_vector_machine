How is this analogy relevant you ask? Well unlike yesterday... I'll tell you. I have woken up at 2 oclock for the past 3 days. At first I was proud of this fact.... but now it is sincerly depressing me. By the time I am even presentable to the outside world, there are only like 3 hours of daylight left! I need help!I am so taking a sleeping pill tonight at like seven. Maybe I might be able to get up before most people come home from work.  Oh! And despite what Marissa may claim.. her journal is amusing. :)  I officially think Hal Sparks is the funniest man alive. He is as funny as Orlando Bloom is hot.  And that is saying something.
