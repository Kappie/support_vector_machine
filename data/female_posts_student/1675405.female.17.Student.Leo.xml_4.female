       
      Do not stand at my grave and weep I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow I am the diamond glint on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain I am the gentle autumn rain. When you wake in the morning hush I am the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circling flight I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry I am not there, I did not die.      -Mary Frye  The sight of these words make me long for my Grandmother even more. Even though the poem itself suggests that she is not dead, but instead in everything around me, I cannot stand the thought that she is so close, but yet so far away from my very grasp.
