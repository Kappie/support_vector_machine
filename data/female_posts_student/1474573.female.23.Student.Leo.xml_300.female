I'm graduating this semester and this is the last class I ever have to take for my BA.  Because of this I took the class as Pass/Fail.  (I believe Passing is considered anything above a D)  I also believe you mentioned that if anyone had a certain average and completely bombed on the Final, that you would not count it.  Even though my average is not an A or a B, I can't see why I should have to take the Final. It doesn't really count for me in any direction.  A P is a P.  It has no value to my GPA except to show that I passed the class.  So basically, doing well on the Final or doing badly does not affect my grade in the class at all...  I try to be the best student I can in the class by participating, telling you when I can't make it, keeping up on the assignments - and I have definitely improved my grades from the beginning of the semester...so basically, I beg of you to let me out of taking the Final.  It would really lift a weight off of my shoulder.  Por favor?!  See you tomorrow,  Dyanna   So...whaddaya think the crazy Cuban will do?
