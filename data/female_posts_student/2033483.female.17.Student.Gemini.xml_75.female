I had a test in Algebra, I know I got atleast 4 wrong because what I got didn't look like the answers I got on the review sheet.  Then in Lit and Comp we presented.  I was happy on account of I wore my black pants just for that.  Oh, and Sean, note that I saw you tap Ashley and make ticking noises like a clock.  I know our presentation ran long but that was because of the questions and everyones imput.  The noise was uncalled for.  Although all the compliments on my hair made up for it. ;-) Next, we kept watching Good Morning Vietnam in History.  Reviewed in Chem and in Physics.  Then in Newspaper, I sorta did a bunch of little things.  Chris  and I were talking and he told me that I should be editor in chief next year and he has or is going to tell Powers that.  I sorta laughed it off, he then he said he was serious.  And I believe him too because he's said this to me before during one of our Saturday morning meetings.  I'm not sure how to react to this.  I mean if Powers, Lexi and Chris decided that they would want me then by all means I would be honored to do it and I would do my best and work super hard.  But, if Powers doesn't want that to go to me and he thinks someone else is more deserving, I'm not going to be upset about it, I'll still work just as hard as I would otherwise.  Plus, Renae and I already have the entertainment section for next year and that is the part of the paper that we've talked about forever.  So if Chris really does push for me to be Chief then it would be like icing on the cake.  I'm gonna stop talking about it because the chances of this happening are slim to none so anyways...did you see nights Gilmore Girls.  Rory and Dean should be back together and Dean should divorce his wife because come on, who gets married at 18?  Comment...and Sweet Dreams ~Kay
