I work at a gas station right now as I take some time off from school (university).  The pay is crap ($7.60/hour) and there is a lot of politics.  I've been there for a year now and I technically have seniority but my manager is dicking me around.  She's not giving me enough hours so I have no money right now.  I have to get a new job, one that pays more than $10/hour so that I can get my own place.  Getting tired of being screwed over, being forced to train people in one shift (which is impossible), and watching people I've become friends with quit because of all the shit.  Bleh...   -- Listening to... Hoobastank - The Reason --
