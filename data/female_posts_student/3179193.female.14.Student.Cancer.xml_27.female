Certain people will know what I'm talking about.  So much has happened. This trip was... definitely worth it. I don't just mean that moneywise. I meant it was worth going on. Solved so much yet caused so much. Do I make sense? I don't know.  The Erica thing... I gotta read her blog sometime. Haven't been able to read blogs lately. Been grounded off computer. I don't have time to read other blogs. I've only been able to come and blog my stuff out and check my email quickly. I guess you can consider it solved. I don't know. There's still a small thing I wanna talk to her about... maybe I'll talk to her about it Monday. Dunno.  Nima... hmm, I'm screwed. It's all just so messed up. I know that I'm the worst girlfriend ever. I know. Not gonna say anymore. 'Cos he'll get POed that I typed bad stuff about myself. I did, but erased it. So yeah... Nima, you're perfect. You are. It's just that I'm not. That's why I've been such a brat about everything. Sorry for ever making you upset.  The event that was probably the fun-nest was the dance. We all hung out. One thing I learned: don't ever depend on a guy to dance. Their only method of dancing is slow-dancing unless it's for a school assignment. *rolls eyes* Only Jin and Derry danced. Jin was funny...! Haha! Total jokes. Derry was really good. I guess he practised a lot (no duh?!) of pop and lock... Meh, couldn't do much in my skirt but whatever. First time putting on eyeshadow at the dance. Haha! It was cool though. Nima and I slow-danced to...  Don't wanna try no more - Frankie J ,  This I Swear - Nick Lachey ,  Heaven - DJ Sammy , and  The Reason - Hoobastank . THIS I SWEAR by Nick Lachey is my favourite song. I requested it...  Talking to Brian Park right now. Omg... him and Alicia are so cute~! ^^ In my personal opinion, I think they're the cutest couple in school.   Well, I gotta run. Mom's back. Blog tomorrow. Lots to say.
