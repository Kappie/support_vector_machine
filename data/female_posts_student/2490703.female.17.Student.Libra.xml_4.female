It was 5:30 PM, Jenny had nothing planned until later that night so she signed onto AOL messenger with the screen name PrincessJ00 and checked to see if anyone was online. No one was online, so she put on an away message and went downstairs to grab something to eat.  She heated a slice of pizza from the night before and went back upstairs.  Someone IMed her.  Hmm, she thought. The person was LuvMe4Life58. She had no clue who that was, but she talked to them anyway.  LuvMe4Life58: hey  PrincessJ00: Um, hi? Who is this?  LuvMe4Life58: You don't know me, but I sure do know you.  PrincessJ00: What?  LuvMe4Life58: You're pretty. I like your blonde hair and your braces...Don't worry, I think they look good.  PrincessJ00: Wait a second, who the heck is this?  LuvMe4Life58: You don't NEED to know who I am. But....  PrincessJ00: (getting freaked out) But what? Huh? You don't scare me! You're just TRYING to but but its not working!  LuvMe4Life58: It's ok Jen...I won't tell CHRIS that you like him. I'm the only one that knows. I read it in your diary. Just tell me that you'll meet me and everything will be okay.  PrincessJ00: NO! Stop it please... I know this is you Karen! I hate you! Please stop it! (Getting nevus and freshet out, because she didn't tell anyone that she liked Chris)  LuvMe4Life58: This Anita Karen. But I know that Karen is your best friend. And you had a crush on Jeremy, too when you were in 5th grade. I read it in your diary. You hide it in your desk. Left hand drawer, the one at the top. I was  in your room today when you were at school. I left you a little surprise in your closet. Just take a little peek Hun. Don't be afraid, I promise you won't regret it.  PrincessJ00: I don't believe you. NO ONE knows where I hide my diary! STOP please!  LuvMe4Life58: JUST LOOK FOR GOD'S SAKE!  PrincessJ00: NO!  LuvMe4Life58: NOW OR ELSE I'LL GO IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND KILL YOU WHILE I'M AT IT!!!!!!!  PrincessJ00: OMG! Please stop!   LuvMe4Life58: No, I won't kill you. But I just wanted to let you know, if you don't look in your closet- your parents won't be coming home tonight!  PrincessJ00: FINE! If you want me to, just PLEASE don't hurt them PLEASE!  LuvMe4Life58: Thata girl. A little bit closer. I see you- you know that right? I'm outside your window and you look great in that white blouse.  PrincessJ00P: Stop! PLEASE! Who the heck are you?  LuvMe4Life58: LOOK in the closet right now!  PrincessJ00: I'm going, please, just leave me alone!  As she walked closer, her heart beat so hard she couldn't control it. She held onto the doorknob to the closet, twisted it, pushed it open and saw......  THE DEAD BODY OF CHRIS HANGING FROM THE CEILING OF HER CLOSET! Horrified, Jenny ran to the phone and tried to call the police. As she picked up the receiver, a hand grabbed her from behind and said, "you don't want to do that." The voice then turned Jenny around and she saw it was Michael, the quiet boy in her math class. I've been watching you Jenny, and I love you. Jenny struggled to get away but Michael held her tightly. He threw he down on the couch and tied her up with duct tape. "I said that I love you Jenny and I'll do anything to have you. Screaming, Jenny says, "NO, NEVER! LET ME GO, NO, STOP!" Michael knocks her out and says, "If I can't have you, no one can!"  When Jenny wakes up she feels really weird and she doesn't know what happened. She sits up and realized that she doesn't know where she is. She looks around for her clothes and finds nothing. Scared Jenny tries to move but he body is too weak to move. Jenny tries to call out, but nothing comes out. She blacks out again.   When Jenny awakes, she sees a man standing over her wearing all white. She tries to call to him but he puts a hand over her mouth and tells her to be quiet. The man picks Jenny up, wraps her in a sheet, and walks down a long hallway out to a dark car. Jenny was never seen again...  Be careful who you talk to...This could happen to you.  **Isn't this a creepy a story?***
