I'm sick of inconsiderate bastards who are too wrapped up in their own fucking worlds to give a damn about anyone else.  I'm sick of selfish, snotty bitches who just like to create their own sitcoms and 'reality shows' or day-time dramas.  I'm sick of trying to wina lost cause.  I'm sick of living in a world that just... sucks.  All I feel is hate and anger.  I can't take the accusations and all the judgements and the grudges from past complications anymore.  What the hell is the point anyway?  We'll all die someday.  Then I begin to wish that some die sooner than others.  Then the other side of me that actually listens and cares about other people and self-image tells me I shouldn't think like that.  Where the fuck am I supposed to go?  My mom gave me an assignment that I'm supposed to do.  Write down at least 10 things why you still want to live.    1. Sam and Oscar    2. my select few friends    3. battlefield (how pathetic is that?)((hey, whatever tickles your pickle))    4. the good CSI episodes, as rare as they are    5.
