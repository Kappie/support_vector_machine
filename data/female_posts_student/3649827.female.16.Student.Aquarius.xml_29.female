(if that makes any sense)  music:  interpol, once again, for i left the cd in the laptop. it's on PDA, if you are curious. speaking of curious. i'm going to curiosa...haha. i have yet to order the tickets. but i'm thinking it will get done tomorrow. that's when that mofo zach leaves. ok, fine. he's not a mofo. but he called me ugly. ok, fine. he didn't  actually  call me ugly...but implied so. arg, ok...maybe it just seemed that way to me. i don't know why those things should bother me. but they don't exactly boost to your ego. similar thing happened with max...and no i'm not holding nething against either of them. though i might act as though i do. it's really myself. *admits zach and her are friends and she's really not holding nething against him or max for that matter* my self image hasn't been much of a confidence booster lately. i don't really understand why. i'll admit that there were things before about my body that used to appeal to me...but they don't anymore...i just don't see it. i think i might be even more self conscious than i used to be...i don't know. it's stupid. half the time i'm too lazy to do nething. i feel like i'm getting really fat. like hideously fat. obesity is something that can be fixed...your facial structure is not. unless maybe if i got plastic surgery. arg. let's not talk about this anymore. this kid i haven't talked to in forever just IM-ed me. after the stupidity incident...i don't really want to. i'm mean. i don't think i necessarily like being mean or maybe i do. i guess it depends. rambling, sorry.. it takes a long time just to get this all straight. i x-ed that dude i was talking about earlier. i almost felt bad doing it. but what actually made me feel bad was the fact i didn't really feel bad doing it.  man, i watched that sinbad movie today. and i hated it totally. i didn't like sinbad in it. he stole his best friend's girl. i hate those kinds of movies. they get on my fucking nerves. especially when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the third party. i actually liked him more than i liked sinbad. i'd hate the notebook if i watched it. i hated sweet home alabama. not only b.c it wasn't a great movie, but b.c the poor dude lost the woman he thought he loved. and i hate these movies. b/c most of the time i picture myself as that third party...the one who gets the bad end.  i'm sorry if this sounds like complaining (it's probably b/c it is...but) it's not like i've been all that lucky in the love department. yeah i don't feel like getting into this either. maybe someday in the future. or maybe not.  toodles.
