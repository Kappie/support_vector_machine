I just don't know what I am going to do without him. He really is my rock and support. He is always there for me and I want to be there for him if anything happens where he needs me. I am trying to figure out a way to move up there as soon as possible to be with him. I just need to get my car paid off and as soon as that happens I will be on my way. I have always been planning to go to grad school there but now I just think I may want to finish undergrad there instead. Not that I really want to leave USI, because I really love it at that school. but I just have to be with Alek. OKAY, I need to stop crying over him leaving and talk about something else.  This weekend was great. I did have to work but other than that, I was with Alek hanging out. He got his second tattoo. It's a treble clef. VERY COOL!!! He is so very very HOT!!!! So after he got his tat we colored my hair and watched a movie. First, let me talk about my hair. It is very dark and a little bit red. So Cool!! It is different from what I am used to but Alek loves it and it is starting to grow on me too. Next, we watched the movie "The Ninth Gate." HATED IT!!! The script sucked, directing sucked, and the only thing that was good about it was the fact that I could look at Johnny Depp. I should have bought "The Pirates of the Caribbean" instead but this movie came in a set with "Stir of Echoes" so it was a better deal. Next time I will get "The Pirates of the Caribbean." Well I guess that's all for now. I will tell you more later.
