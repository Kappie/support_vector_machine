Mom and I went shopping in Ever, and I ended up getting a pair of capri denims because all of the pants I tried on didn't fit. O_o Made me wonder if I was getting fat.. I was actually there to get a manicure/pedicure for my prom, but there were too many people in David's Salon. It wasn't a complete waste though as I found a hairstyle while flipping through a magazine. My mom stole the page it was on. n_n;; Not much happened today.. *shrugs*
