     
      Tell me when you're leaving, I'll ask tomorrow to wait  I'm begging of your destiny, begging of my fate  Why is life so callously cruel to a fellow such as I?  Why to my one true love do I have to say goodbye?   Tears trail in streams down my troubled face  For the chambers of my mind is anguishâ€™s last place  My voice finds no minute strength to even bid thee well  For fear has just resolved in my broken heart to dwell   To leave me now, my love, would be to take my soul...  For without you in my life, I will never be whole.  But alas, if you earnestly insist, I will not hinder thee,  For loving means giving; so I'm setting you free...
