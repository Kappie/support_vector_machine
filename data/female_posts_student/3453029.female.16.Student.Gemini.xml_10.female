Okay so I have to wake up early this week to go to the theatre. I am helping Laura and DAnny with teaching a childrens workshop. Today we decided after it ends to go to Joes and come back to my house to type a script for their performance next friday. Have we yet? Nope, lol. We went outside to play on the tire swing. Until my cousins started attacking DAnny, so we came inside. Laura has been making me sing karaoke to "Raindrops keep falling on my head" and then "This magic magic moment". It was fun. Hopefully we can do this again.  DAnny is having such a hard time typing on this laptop. And Laura is making me sing all the songs she wants to. I feel like "Ella Enchanted". Whenever she says something to do, I HAVE TO DO IT! Its quite funny. Now DAnny  I have to sing "STOP! IN THE NAME OF LOVE".  What a fun day. Laura hasn't been on the computer basically all day. She is curing her boredom disease.   I LOVE DAnny AND LAURA. B.F.F
