I saw a 10 year old boy giving a cigarette to his 8 year old brother as they were walking home from school the other day. This 9th grade girl I talk to every now and then got pregnent and refuses to get an abortion. Her 'boyfriend' (an 17 year old dropout) has refused to return her phonecalls since he's got the news and she's going to have to go to some special school a few cities away so she can keep up with the work without haveing to go threw the horrors of high-school ridicule.  It seems that now the school year is winding down, everyone is getting high on friday nights. Its sad, freshman as going to get high, using their parents money to pay for it all.  And if you're not hanging out with stoners or 'doing it' with your boyfriend at the time, then you're studying for a big test or catching up on your homework. If not that, then you're working. Because everything costs money and no one seems to have a lot of it right now. What with you cell phone bill and the overages for texting everyone, the clothes you wear, the three times youve gone to the movies with your bou or your friends this month, the makeup you've bought, or the expensive lunches you've had. Its insane! I can't wait until summer, when I too *sigh* have to get a job, but at least I wont have to worry about tests or projects and I will be able to get in the pool and practise a little waterpolo with my team. It's been about 3 weeks since I've been in the pool. I cant wait...its sad, i miss practise and even more, the games.  My eyebrow piercing is heeling nicely and it's only a week or two until I can take it out. Which is perfect for polo, timing or what???      Well, I'm at my mom's house this weekend, I havent seen her in a long time and we both thought that we needed to get together.      I want to go shoppig again. I have no money. I prolly wont have money because I dont have a job. I can't get any job because I dont have a car. I dont have a car because I dont have my licence. I dont have my licence because I still have to wait until the end of July, at least. I can't babysit, because my sister holds the monopoly on that job...little sister by the way. I cant hit my mom up for money, because she doesnt have any. I can't hit my dad up, because we went shopping afew weeks ago and he spent ike $200 on me and he's paying $150 for polo and prolly $70 for lessons. Thats alot and I need a job. I already owe him like $150 and thats being modest.       I have to go, I've written quite a lot.
