Well... people dont stop to think about what you've learned or what difference a teacher can make in your life. Mister Rea has made a big difference in my life. He can be mean, gay, funny, dumb,serious at times, a good teacher and something you dont find in every teacher... a gay friend. Nah i need to be serious, in mister rea i found alot of trust, confidence and most of all faith.He is a cool teacher because he gets at our levels sometimes, its like he still has that kid within him which i think is cool. The other day, we were taking turns using the scooter. Hes a really cool teacher and person to be around with.  He has taught me so many differnet interesting things which i thought made this class fun.  He taught me to get in touch with the person within me. He showed me to get in touch with my feelings and to be able to express them ( just on the computer though).I learned how to use a computer the nice way, to have patience, new ways to explore the internet and most of all to ask for help. I was the type of person with alot of pride that wouldnt want any ones help or nothing like that but in this class its different, The only way you can learn is by asking for help and its ok to do so.  I think i can take this class over and over and over again just because mister rea made it fun, i always eager to come to his class, i actually enjoy working in this class. The things that i learned in this class im pretty sure would be useful for the future when they find out i can make my own wep page and have my own website thats really cool, so mister rea thank you for teaching me the interesting things i learned in this class i never thought i would need but im pretty sure i do.. mister rea you rock!!
