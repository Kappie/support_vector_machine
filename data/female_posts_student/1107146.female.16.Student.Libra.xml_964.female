NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, I'm slowly and painfully getting over it.  And thanks for posting so much, yall.  Gives me a few minutes unboredness.  Rosie - it looks like yall are going to have to work the DI thing without me for a while.  Will and Sarah know what they're doing, so listen to them.  They just need to come up with some instant challenges, then have you play a little scum, but we really do need to break out "Taboo" (the game where you have to guess a word without saying certain other words)  Maybe I'll be feeling better by the weekend and we'll be able to get together.
