Protect my mourning soul And comfort my love-starved self.  I cling to you. I pine for your presence, Godde. Waiting anxiously for the taste of your salvation upon my lips.  I imagine salvation tastes - like honey. - like green tea and jasmine.  -like salt licked from a man's post-coital, sweat-soaked back. I imagine salvation tastes Wonderful.  Who do I have to fear In this colourful (colour-stained) world?  What pagan soul have I unravelled With my Jesus-freak sensibilities?  In a woman's arms, Your arms, I wish to lie.  You seem like grace incarnate to me.  Godde is manifest. Not unreachable. Eager to be traced.  The small of a woman's back, (the gateway to the womb) The curve of her neck (the matching pulse point of life) Laying shallow into the valley Of her breasts (the center of her heart).  Godde pulses, sweats, and breathes Alive in us all.
