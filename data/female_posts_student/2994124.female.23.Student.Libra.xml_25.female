Have had a fiddle with it and it seems to be letting me post there, but not sure if it is working for everyone else!  am at the library in Birmingham at the moment, just on my way to Symphony Hall to listen to Faure's Requiem - I love it. I've sung it a few times and its GORGEOUS.  So anyway I must dash but will fill you in on it later plus my bizarre trip this morning!!  Oh good news - the place where I left my camera and fleece have found them, and someone who works there is coming down to Birmingham on Friday and so I can get them from her. Yipee!  Had strange lecture on mental health and self-esteem today - could have practically given the class myself!  Now have scary homework to do: why is your self esteem the way it is?  If your self esteem is a tree, what are the water and sun that nourish it, and what are the wind, drought, and lumberjacks which cut it down? !!!!!!!
