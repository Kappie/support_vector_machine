I know it is something I have touched with the tips of my fingers, but for some reason or another have not managed to hold on to ... I desperately long for it.   Even though it is not explicitly acknowledged, different 'theories' of happiness---or of what makes for 'the good life'---are firmly rooted in decades-old philosophical assumptions.   Plato , espoused a very rationalistic view of happiness. He felt that happiness means being a "just' person. Such a person is one in whom the three parts of the psyche---reason, the will, and the appetites---are in balance, such that each is able to perform its duty fully and without interference from the other.   It should be noted, of course, that Plato felt this type of happiness is achieved by only a select few people, namely the "philosopher kings" of his time.  For  Marcus Aurelius  true happiness (or at least some modicum of peace or neutrality) arises under three major conditions: when we fully accept Nature, society, and ourselves; when we engage in complete self-absorption; and when we exercise our daily duty to others and to society.   My own understanding of Aurelius leads me to consider his a "happiness by default"---one becomes happy when one is not subject to the pain that occurs in the absence of these conditions.    Sigmund Freud  conspired to render happiness a dubious, even suspect notion. Freud could only offer his patients "ordinary unhappiness" as relief from their neurotic suffering.  The  Hedonism Theory,  in all its variants, holds that happiness is a matter of raw subjective feeling. A happy life maximizes feelings of pleasure and minimizes pain. A happy person smiles a lot, is ebullient, bright eyed and bushy tailed; her pleasures are intense and many, her pains are few and far between. This theory has its modern conceptual roots in Bentham's utilitarianism, its contagion in Hollywood entertainment, its grossest manifestation in American consumerism.  The  Desire Theory  can do better than Hedonism. It holds that happiness is a matter of  getting what you want , with the content of the "want" left up to the person who does the wanting. Desire theory subsumes hedonism when what we want is lots of pleasure and little pain.   My principle objection to desire theory is that one might desire only to collect china tea cups or orgasms or only to listen to Country and Western music or to count fallen leaves all day long. The world's largest collection of tea cups, no matter how "satisfying," does not seem to add up to much of a happy life. One move to deflect this objection is to limit the scope of desire theory to the fulfillment of only those desires that one would have if one aimed at an objective list of what is truly worthwhile in life.  The  Objective List Theory  lodges happiness outside of feeling and onto a list of "truly valuable" things in the real world. Such a list might include career accomplishments, friendship, freedom from disease and pain, material comforts, civic spirit, beauty, education, love, knowledge, and good conscience.   Then there are those, from Saint-Juste to the situationists, with detours through Stendhal and Baudelaire, who take happiness seriously as a political claim. For these writers, happiness was an idea that needed to be liberated from the aristocracy and made available to all of humanity.   Perhaps the question is completely moot when we ask ourselves whether "happiness" even exists in the first place.  Both Plato and Marcus Aurelius---as well as Western society in general---use the word "happiness", leading one to believe that there is such a thing as happiness that can be understood and apprehended. There is some universal feeling so common to all of us that it deserves its own label.  But what if this feeling does not exist?  What if we have created the word "happiness" to describe a plethora of  different  feelings? Are any of us talking about the same  thing ? Worse, are we trying to create definitions that reify a purely linguistic term? If so, what are our personal, cultural, and political motivations for doing so? Any consideration of the "best" perspective on happiness must include extensive---and intensive---reflection on these critical questions.  Mark Kingwell wrote that happiness means to feel that one is living a life worth living. Many people find this definition profoundly empty or anxiety-provoking because it doesn't give them anything they can work with. In fact, some say that it makes them feel even unhappier. But the alternative---prescribing happiness formulas---is ultimately doomed to failure. The minute we try to dictate what happiness is, or should be, we place individuals in a passive, powerless position. We succeed in telling them that they do not know enough about themselves or the world to apprehend and/or appreciate the true meaning of happiness. If placed in such a position, will not some individuals feel that they are actually  unworthy  of happiness? If I thought myself too stupid to apprehend happiness on my own, would I feel I deserved to be happy in the first place?   Kingwell's special bugaboo is Prozac. He doesn't blame people for turning to happy pills --confronted as they are by what he calls "consumerism, psychopharmacology and therapeutic fetishism." But he does criticize psychiatrists for pathologizing unhappiness, thereby subtly ratcheting up the social pressure to be happy. In the end, he comes down firmly on the side of Aristotle's notion of happiness -- an austere idea that you're only as happy as you are virtuous.  I think Todd Solondz's film "Happiness" more or less summed up the prevailing sense that happiness has become at best a kind of pathology: a smiley face plastered over the dark nightmare of American suburbia.   =)
