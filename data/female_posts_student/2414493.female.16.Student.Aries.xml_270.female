It was exactly like the lady said who was sitting behind us on the tram on the way to the parking structure. A day like that was so good you couldn't top it for the rest of the summer, which makes everything anticlimactic. There's nothing like the happiest place on earth to start off a summer. It was a perfect day, really. It was nice out, not scorching. When we got there at around 9 the lines were unexpectedly short: we tackled the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad first and we just walked through the line, basically. I'm just so glad I got to go back. It's funny that it takes me 16 years to go on those "big" Disneyland rides.  So a final count:  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: 2 times Mr. Toad's Wild Ride (oh, it was wild): 1 teacups: 1, and the cup wouldn't spin. We're getting too big. Nigel said we've all aged. the coaster in Toontown: 1 Splash Mountain: 1, single rider Matterhorn: 2 Honey, I Shrunk the Audience: 1 Star Tours: 1 Haunted Mansion: 1 Pirates of the Caribbean: 1 Indiana Jones: 3, twice illegally  Here I have to laugh. After waiting 45 minutes in the glorious shade the first time, Nige discovers that we can hop the rope and go on again. So we do. Nigel the courageous doesn't think much of it, Ellis laughs. Smirks. All the way in. And then puts on the straight face. The third time we were even more daring and just went through the exit.   We left at 8ish with Ellis. It's goodbye for ten months. Went to the Elephant Bar. Artichoke dip, a mushroom-only sandwich. My first creme brulee. I fell asleep in the car until Mom called asking me where I was.   George Washington warns against entangling alliances. Track 2, Transatlanticism: "You shouldn't think what you're feeling."  Trust me, it was much better in person. I remember I just couldn't stop laughing on some of the rides, it was just fun in the purest sense. I remember yesterday and I remember sunlight and Jackie laughing, all of us laughing...in a weird way, it was a time to refrain from pictures so that all those memories remained in your head the way they're supposed to. It was so worth it.   Today: beach cleanup at Leo Carillo. Charlie and Enid went nuts. We were resting in the mural tunnel when all of a sudden I spied at least 10 beer bottles resting on the ledge above us. Jess happily put all of them in a bag, the bottles clinking so loud they broke. We couldn't find Enid for a while, who eventually discovered that elusive cave and fell asleep when she realized Charlie and I had lost her. Splashing in the waves. Neptune's afterward. I now know what clam strips are. Mom called me at 10ish: "You just went out yesterday!" But honestly, what would I do at home? Entertain her by sitting around with a book? Setting the table? I hope it occurs to her soon enough that it's summer, I'm home to annoy her for two weeks and only two weeks and she might as well suck it up. Ow. That wasn't nice.  "Nazis invented the window-lock."  I'm just so content right now. I'm sitting here, feet sandy and still in my volunteer shirt and everything. I was itching to blog all the way home. I wouldn't mind if I just spent the rest of the afternoon reading. And thinking. Or planning more grand adventures.
