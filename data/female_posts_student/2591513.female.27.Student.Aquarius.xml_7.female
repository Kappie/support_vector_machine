That is AMAZING with his heart condition and he really put his all in it, so that is what counts.  I am so very proud of that little man.  He is growing so fast.  I don't know where the time goes...even though he makes me so angry when he is in the mood to whine and cry.  I love that boy beyond anything I can ever imagine and I can't imagine my life without him.  When I am feeling down and like I want the world to pity me, I remember that he has been through so much in his young life but keeps going on and amazing every person he touches in his life...and he has two great cooky little sisters too.  I LOVE my kids and with them I am nothing.  They have taught me the important things in life and showed me what it means to love and be loved.
