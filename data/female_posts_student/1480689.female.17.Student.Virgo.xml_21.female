Mike's been more, well no, he's been less sweet. it's like he's been spazzing on me lately and i fucking hate it. ok so i went to ask my dad about alternators for the car we're probably getting and i said "daddy I'm confused...." and mike's like ok i dont wanna hear you cry to your dad.... so i proceded to get pissed. you'd think it would matter if i was mad, well it sure as hell didnt seem to matter.    whatever. im sad and pissed, but that doesnt matter anymore does it.
