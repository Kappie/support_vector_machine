I wish i could write on here everything that i've learned... but it's so much that one: it wouldn't fit on here, and two: i can't even remember everything. A week at a camp where everyone passionately loves the Lord is just amazing, thats all i can say, amazing! I feel like i have grown and changed to much in a good way, and i'm so excited to see where all of this takes me!   I also think it's amazing how close 7 strangers in a cabin can grow in just 7 days. I seriously love those girls and its so crazy that just 7 days ago they were strangers to me. God works in such awesome and wonderful ways and it's so neat to step back and look at everything he's doing!   I just got a little taste of what being a senior feels like, and it really does make EVERYTHING, even simple things, 100 times better, just because you're a SENIOR!! But, it also makes things sadder because its the last of everything. Last week was my last week at Pine Cove as a camper... that is so sad. I'm considering being a counselor there over the summer... it's just hard because i couldn't put down my flute for 5 weeks and not practice, especially if that's what i'm going to continue doing in college... i guess i'll have to see about that when it comes.   That's my mini summary over my FABULOUS week last week. I am so ready to go out and get the new Polyphonic Spree album "Together We're Heavy"!!! I"ll do that sometime today, hopefully.   Well, that is all i will say for now... it does feel good to be home, though. I do love my bed!  Bye kids!  -Lisa  Song: "I'm Always In Love" - Wilco
