This is my fave birthday one: *clears throat* "I thay to you from all uth ducks... ((inside)) ... getting older really thucks." And, "It's your birthday! ((inside)) Get down with your bad thelf!" Haha... I think he's cute. Color me crazy...  I went to the dentist for the firstest time 2day! Yay for me! I got my teeth cleaned. Uggh... one word to describe it. GUNK. It was gross! But she gave me a sticker :) heh heh. And the new Crest Whitening Expressions toothpaste! Mmmm!!!  Mom has bible study over here 2night and we get PIZZA! WooHoo! Nothin like greasy, cheesy, yet still healthy food after a trip to the dentist. But I have 2 go 2 the optomotrist on Monday... *sigh* "Life Thucks." *lol* Well, I g2g surf blogger!
