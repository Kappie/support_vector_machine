LOL... =S and the village was hilarious. ok. catwoman was sposed to be my comic relief from the village, but it turns out that the village was my comic "relief" from catwoman. LOL. catwoman was pretty good though, but nothing beats the village and all its hilarity: mrs. clack, slow motion, nostrils, those we dont speak of, the forbidden colour, the safe colour, magic rocks... LOL. sure, there was this one part that was sorta freaky... and i was like plugging my ears coz the music is really what makes it scary, but in this one part this thing went across the screen and jez screamed/yelled. it was hilarious. we were like leaning close coz it was scary, but then it was sorta disappointing. oh well. hilarious movie. memoriez... good timez good timez!! well, they wanta go swimming coz malc slept over again, but im too lazy... would rather go look at that piano... we might get it... we have a "deal"... or sum'n... mehh anyhoo. oh. and now we're going camping to alberta instead of just a day trip... and more ppl are coming.. we're either leaving friday or sunday.. oh well. heh
