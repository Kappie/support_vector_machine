Your IQ score is 133   This number is the result of a formula based on how many questions you answered correctly on Tickle's Classic IQ test. Your IQ score is scientifically accurate; to read more about the science behind our IQ test, click here.   During the test, you answered four different types of questions — mathematical, visual-spatial, linguistic and logical. We analyzed how you did on each of those questions which reveals how your brain uniquely works.  We also compared your answers with others who have taken the test. According to the sorts of questions you got correct, we can tell your Intellectual Type is a Visionary Philosopher.  This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others — and at anticipating and predicting patterns"  Pretty cool, huh? especially since I wanna be a teacher. ------- Anyway. We went to see Van Helsing yesterday. Pretty good movie, all in all. Except there were these american ladies behind us who were talking through the  entire  thing. I swear. The entire cinema is silent, someone just died, and the woman behind me goes: "oh, did she get killed? Grrrrr...  Today we wnt to the family-fun day thing at school. I got a little teddybear, whom I'm calling Fredrick William II (after F. W. the first, the Sergeant King, the one who had a thing for tall soldiers XD) And I got a little magic doohicky of mass destruction. You know, one of those twirly things...I can't remember what it's called XD  And I got two lollipops ^_^  And I strted doing the drawings for the new layout for this ^_^
