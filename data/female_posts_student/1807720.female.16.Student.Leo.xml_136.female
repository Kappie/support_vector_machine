Sometimes I just want to sit down and have a quiet peaceful meal but that is impossible.  When I got home she was like: "look, look at the rabbit outside."  And like I have seen a million rabbits in my life time and like can anyone say...BORING!!!  She kept going on about that thing for like 10 minutes.  Ten minutes about a rabbit ok!!  Can you feel my pain??!?  In Bio I am kind of worried that some people in my group might not get their stuff done.  I have to be worried because my marks are VERY important.  There is this one really nice girl, Lisa, in my group and she is willing to do the work, but the other two people drew a dart board on the white board and used some sort of magnet for the arrow and they played that while they were suppose to be doing research.  Then they broke the first laptop we were given and they glued on the key they broke and then got another one.  When they got the other laptop they didn't even do their reasearch - like I said they just played that dart game thing.  I feel as if I am being portrayed as a bad student or something.  I mean with no one nominating me for habits of mind last term that especially makes my thoughts more realistic.  Especially I feel like Mrs. J feels I am a bad student, I don't know why I feel this way but something makes me think that right now.  I know I have a good work ethic and try hard, and do know lots, but sometimes I wonder if she ever forgot that and now has a different opinion of me.  I am probably just over reacting and thinking too much, but that is how I feel.  English was actually really good today.  We had to answer these really boring questions but then we got to write a poem.  And poetry is MY THING.  I LOVE writting poems.  So yeah that was fun, and something I am good at.  We played handball in active living and I thought that the guys might not let the few girls play but they did and they were totally ok with it, so yeah that was fun.
