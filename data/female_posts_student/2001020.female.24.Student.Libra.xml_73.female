I was supposed to have dinner with B, but B said today that this "probably wasn't a good night."  Fine.  So I call F.  F said he has dinner plans with C.  I said, "Why don't you and C just come with me?" and he said, "I don't know about that."  FUCK OFF!  What the hell?  Ugh!  So now I'm stuck here with an appetite and my roommate's crackers.  How is this possible?  I am so much fun to eat dinner with!  It's not even like it's a date...it's FOOD!  Fuckin' fuckin' a.  I don't need a partner to eat dinner with, but since I had planned to go out to dinner tonight, and B decided it wasn't a good night (blah blah blah), I was hoping to have dinner with some sort of companionship tonight.  No damn dice.  Freakish boys out there.  A girl wants to go to dinner with you...YOU SAY YES!  I don't think law school boys are even boys.  They're like half-girls.  The girls in law school have more balls than the dudes.  RIDICULOUS.  Can you tell I'm just a little damn IRRITATED right now?  UGH.
