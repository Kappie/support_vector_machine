I was puttiing off cutting my hair to save money.. But my mother looked at me today and said..  'Ah hui ah go have a haircut. your hair is covering your eyes already and its long behind your neck also! You look very untidy..'  Seeing my hesitant face she knew exactly what stopped me from going.. Then she shoved me 15 bucks tell me go go go.. Ahh.... I love my mother... There's no one in this world who would have more love for me..  The hairstylist was pretty funny with his malaysian accent...  He's a little on the 'soft' side as most male hairstylists are.. But he's a ok chap... really chatty guy blabbering non stop about taiwanese variety shows... hah... he actually think that I'm a secondary school student! Sad....  My brother's girlfriend took mc again today and stayed at our place the whole day.. I wonder when my bro is gonna marry her.. He's already 32! Pah... Men have longer 'shelf life'...  I have to go study for my investment test on thursday.. I shouldn't complain.. Its a blessing to have a chance to study.. But it really really sucks! Praying that the test would be smooth sailing..
