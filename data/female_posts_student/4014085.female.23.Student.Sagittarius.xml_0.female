I called Dad and he gave me the super secret number to the Supervisor of Elections so that I could call and check up on it. To my surprise, I spoke to lovely, helpful woman named Angela who told me that it usually takes 4 to 6 weeks to process but that she could do it over the phone for me right now. She then let me know where my polling place was and where I could go if I wanted to vote early.   I would like to say, "Thank you" to Angela again for being extremely nice and informative.   That being said, have you gotten your registration card yet? The deadline is August 2nd, so if you haven't get in touch with your local elections office and get it done! Every vote counts and this time we will make  sure  of it.
