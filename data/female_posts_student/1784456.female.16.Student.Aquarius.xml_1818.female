Who wouldn't kill to see them live? *i did :)*  urlLink Levellleeeers!  And if you don't know who they are then be ashamed, they're sooo cool! (Yeah I'm sure the kiddy tone of voice helped to convince you) Nah go download some, it's illegal to not have at least ten Levellers songs on a PC. *will hunt down your IP addy and check :P*
