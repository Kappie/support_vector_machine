Then check my progress in the evening, and publish two more posts telling the day's story, or new ideas.  2. In the EQ blog, I shall choose an area to focus on in each week. For example, controlling my addiction to the web, increasing responsiveness to people and tasks, sleeping early and getting up early, keeping in touch with people and helping them proactively, etc. On the first day of each week, I'll develop goals and strategies, and try them on myself. During the following days, I'll reflect on my progress in that particular area, and focus on that one area only. If I could not do it, try to find out why, as I suspect that there are deeper causes for a lot of my problems beyond not having the skill. At the end of the week, I'll discuss whether I've made a sustainable change, whether it is necessary to continue the current project, or whether it is necessary to tackle some of the deeper causes first before coming back to it.  3. In the research blog, I'll post research plans for the week, summaries of books read and how it relates to my research, new questions, challenges, people to contact, new models and frameworks, etc.  I realize that this will be a long process, as I have many areas to develop, and I could be disorganized if there is no pressure for organization. But in terms of my life's journey, I need to face my bad habits and correct them before it's too late. Even if I only work on one area per month in EQ, I could still develop 12 areas, which will make me a better person.   In terms of research, if I can spend time thinking about it everyday, our research team has all the talents to do high-quality, extremely interesting research. We could make good contribution to the community, only if I could control my weaknesses and start working harder. So it should be a very fulfilling thing.   Of course, the success of this program will largely depend on my ability to control myself and keep it up. Changes are painful, changes are hard, changes normally don't sustain. I'm well aware of that, and will take it slowly. The point of the blog is to provide myself commitment, and maybe some pressure, for keep doing this work. I believe this is highly valuable and worthwhile, just need the will power and maybe monitoring to get myself keep doing it. I'm trying :)
