With the time difference, I'm usually slaving away at school when she's online, and with her doing the HSC and me the IB, we've gotten soooo busy! So I think the new mode is to have a blog, and Libby twisted my arm into getting one - saying, "at least just to keep me updated!"  There you have it - a blog to see into my little hobbit hole. My posts might be deep & meaningful, random or pointless, so take them or leave them. love you all!
