"did he do it for the money? or was it for the fame? finally somebody asked him, jesse, why do you want to rob them trains? and jesse said is just what i do when i can't get no loving, is just what i do when i can't get no loving, i'm the meanest hombre you ever saw 'cause baby i ain't getting no loving at all, is just what i do, is just what i do"   #2 ... food?   i don't know if a smoothie quialifies as food but, i've been a smoothie junkie for a few years now, lately however i seriously can't stop drinking the damn things ... i've tried most of them at "smoothie king" and most of them suck ... my one and only is "strawberry x-treme" ... i'm not big and i can totally finish the large smoothie easily and still go for another round   #3 ... tv show?   i don't watch tv at all ... when i did i had a lot of shows i liked ... i think if i could pick a show to watch again it would be a tie between "charmed" and "will and grace" ... it's like magical vs funny ... hard choice, ain't it?   #4 ... scent?   coconut ... it brings beautiful images to my mind  it smells heavenly  it tastes good  the word coconut almost inspires me to paint what i picture as paradise  a beautiful deserted beach, white sand, blue blue water, a radiant sun, coconut trees giving refreshing shade ... crispy tanned coconut skin, tiny knickers, and sunglasses  ... summer time    #5 ... quote?   "i blame my mother for everythin that is wrong with me and if you knew her, you would too" ... it's by me, it's true, it's funny, it conveys a message, and i wasn't trying   http://www.fridayfive.org
