The gloom and doom of painful nights Have locked me in this dreary plight My wings are broken, can make no flight Blackness covering, and blinding my sight  Wicked words and evil deeds Poisoning within, this mead Planted carefully, of blackness this seed Oh to where will this dark road lead?  Someone help me! Please assist! This anger growing like a cyst! Light a fire, clear this mist, Clenched hard like rocks, are my fists  For love and hatred do not mix One or the other, you must pick This broken bridge, this heart must fix, Like holy water no wolf can lick  by norain isa   A new beginning  Sneak a peak through morbid eyes See the fire that rages inside To act ungodly is a sin What devil, what satan lies within  I wish someone would take me high Upon the clouds, see heavens bright Release me from this deadly lock And dress me in a pure white frock  by norain isa   Me  If I could swim away, I would To explore the hidden sea Secrets written across the sand, Unknown to you or me  If I could run away, I would And caress the sandy peaks A world of laughter, happiness and joy Hidden away, for no one to see  If I could fly away, I would And join the birds so free To learn the myths, stories untold And find the inner me  by norain isa
