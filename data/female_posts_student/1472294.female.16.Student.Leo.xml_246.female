Did nothing much today, not even going outside to buy New Year cards or even design one for my friend coz I only have her full address... Ok, so I just surf the net until my brother comes home and snatch it to play his Jin Yong. Haiz, I must stop complaining and ranting on and on. Hmm... Today I have decided on a spur of interest to research about FF X-2... Ya, I know, it is oudated, so long already. But I am like that, so I went to their costume changes and was amazed by their so many costume changes. Cool! Oh, did I say I never play before any Final Fantasy games or ANY online or PS or anything that requires a stupid joystick? I played a Super Mario game once, on PS with my cousin and guess what? I burst out crying and my hands sweated like a waterfall. I always, never fail to sweat and get excited when playing virtual games. Haiz.... That's why I am not that close to my cousins as they are all boys. Plus, we are having a family gathering this Saturday. But I cannot go coz work disallows me to do so. I am actually quite happy. Wonder they ever read my blog or not? Hmm.... Oh gosh, I can actually lead from a game so far away... Ok, back to FF X-2. I actually like their costumes a lot, that was why I was attracted to the game. But never played before. I love is their 'Songtress' costume, including Rikku and Paine. Very cool. Not forgetting their 'White Mage' costume... And their '1000 Words' and 'Real Emotion'. Ooo, just so cool. If I can cosplay, I will do one of their costume and acting as Paine. Coz she look so fierce and her hair is the shortest and I  think  the easiest to style. Yuna's hair is fine. But her hair requires a 'ironing' hair kit, ya know what I mean. And dying my hair to brown is so boring. I don't mind changing to Paine's ash- grey color.  Gatsby  has that color... Hehe! But providing first I know how to make and design clothes.... Ok, enough of FF X-2. Now, I shall talk about Fatal Frame 2, another FF. FF 2 is scary and colder. Two twins with sixth sense investigating a huanted village is so way scary... Argh. I also never play the game before, I was again attracted by the twins' innocent looks and great outfit. Then I visited their official website with fear and it was ok lah in the end. I really LOVE their outfit. I will try to design the braver sister's (forgot the name ^^). Coz she is wearing pants. Haha. Their clothes are also very lacy and figure-hugging... Oh, how I love their clothes...
