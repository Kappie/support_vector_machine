I got to work with Ryan, Tom, and Deidra and it was pretty funny. I don't know what it was but i think i was really hyper lol. I felt weird cuz i havent been hyper atall this year. Maybe its just from me bein sick this past week. I'm not sure but right now im feeling a bit *blah* ya know lol. Right now i want nothing todo with Jeremy. I cant stand him. He's such a jerk! Ya know, why cant any guys down here just be nice?..I mean Ryan Mark and Tom are nice...(fla.guys) there needs to be more of them lol. But anyway...FCAT writin is coming up soon Liz is freakin out, i said to her just chill cuz its no big deal. Nothing really counts on that anyway.I feel like im about to crazy, not cuz FCAT just cuz i feel like it lol. Anyway nothings really goin on..i'll be on AOL later hopefully if my brother will let me lol. Byes
