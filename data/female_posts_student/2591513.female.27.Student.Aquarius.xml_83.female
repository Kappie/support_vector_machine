I do owe Jessica a HUGE thank you for treating the entire family out to dinner.  She didn't have to.  Thank you so much.  It was fun.  Are you allergic to seafood?  haha  We are very fortunate to maintain friendships with most of Leila's gfs.  They have all been great to have around.  Like I consider Mica, Mary and Amber my friends too, like in some ways my little sisters.  I am so proud of all of them.    Anyway, it was so worth every hardship I had to get to that point.  Walking on the stage adn hearing them talk about me was nice, but the best part was seeing Nalani as I walked back to the chairs and seeing her big smile and saying. "Mommy!"  I think that made the whole situation because it is those three little people who are my driving force.  They inspire me.  Anyway, that is it...I hope you are all having a fantastic week.  I know I am...well minus the money woes, we are having a good week.
