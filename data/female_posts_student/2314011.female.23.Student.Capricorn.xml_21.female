I should be getting my ass to school to study study study for finals, but I just want to sit on my stylish futon and watching bad but good movies all day.  Plus, I'm getting sick.  Yes, the first tell-tale tickles of a sore throat started yesterday, and this morning the sinuses are starting to join the party.  Yay. At least this week's an easier....well, let's just say lighter....week than last.  And the Thanksgiving vacation begins Friday at 1, so there's that too. But I just had to write a little something this morning because I was inspired by my boyfriend's new-born blog.  HI HONEY!!!  Suppose you all should get used to hearing about him.  His name's Levi, but I may refer to him at any time as "the boy," "that guy," "my guy," "my boyfriend," or "the Jew" (because he's not).  And really, he's not my boyfriend either, but that's part of the joke, get it? Alrighty...I'll be plodding along now...have to see about changing the body text color on this damn thing to make it easier for some pansy-asses to read!
