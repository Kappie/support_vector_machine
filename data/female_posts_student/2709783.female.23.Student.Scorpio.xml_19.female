I would like to clarify some misconceptions in each of your emails before I go into detail about how untangling hair from stitches is just as gut-wrenching as it sounds.    First, I didn't mention the appointment because I didn't want Wine Tasting Wednesday to focus on my own physical shortcomings (i.e., odd neck-lump) instead of what it should be focused on:  elective surgery, Reagan's legacy, strangers from the Midwest, and second amendment rights.  Not because I am some Rumsfield-school-of-secrecy graduate (this was implied by Brina).    Second, the Reaganomics day off was not a lie (as implied by Michele).  Since Friday, the national day of mourning, was my regularly scheduled day off, the feds gave me 8 hours of vacation time to use, so that I would be even with all of my co-workers and not feel discriminated against for having Friday off.  I picked Thursday, due to its proximity to Wednesday night, and also because I was probably just going to call in sick otherwise.    Finally, I know that you both would have been more than willing to nurse me back to health, if I had asked.  However, I'm a very bad patient, which is why I didn't want any post-op nursing.  Even my own mother dreads taking care of me when sick, so I wouldn't wish my demanding nature on either of you two accommodators  (accommodators in the sense of catering to the needs of others, not the Esbeck definition).  Luckily for Jaimee and Coby, they've both been out of the house quite a bit, which means I can't boss them around either.  I've caught up on lots of non-academic reading, re-organized my planner (even on Vicodin, I'm still OCD), and watched lots of Law and Order.  It's actually been a nice little drug-hazed vacation.  Speaking of drugs, since I handled the stitches so bravely after the local anesthetic wore off, my doctor decided I have a high tolerance for pain and would therefore only be needing a day's worth of painkillers.  If I hadn't been so woozy, I would have explained that I didn't cry and thrash when he was stitching me up because I'm too proud to degrade myself in front of two highly trained medical professionals, not because I have some superhuman ability to bear foreign objects under my skin.    Luckily, I keep a stash of Vicodin from my last medical adventure (spider bite) handy at home, in case I need a bikini wax or something similarly excruciating.  It's about time that came in handy for something besides sleeping cocktails.
