A state of emergency was called there this morning after 150mm of rain poured down on them over 13 hours.  Another 40-70mm is expected today.   urlLink    Biking in the water (from www.thestar.com) urlLink     Some areas of the town have water running 4-feet deep along the main streets.  There have been evacuations and flooding inside most homes.   urlLink    A Car Navigates Through the Water (from Canada.com Hamilton) urlLink     Let's hope there's a drying out very quickly and no one gets hurt in this situation.  Makes me glad I live on a very big hill.  I'm not sure where the summer is, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't what any of these folks had in mind.  More to come...
