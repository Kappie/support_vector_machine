Lists of things I want to do before a certain time, place, whatever. The list I started this morning is:"Companies and People I need to give a new address to when I move". Now, I know, you fill out the little card at the post office, and they change your address when they put that little yellow address sticker on there, but that is only good for like 60 days, and in the meantime, you damn well better be changing your address with everyone you ever dealt with. Plus then there are the places that have my address, but that don't send me mail. Like ebay for instance. And Paypal. Have to change all that information over. Such an annoyance. Broke down and had a cigarette last night, was just going crazy with all the noise the kids were making, and then the tornado sirens went off shortly after I got off the phone with my darling cousin Tina, whom I adore. So we raced to my older sister's house to hide in the basement. But I did make it 16 hours without one. And I have been up for two hours now and have not had one yet. So I am doing pretty well, I think.
