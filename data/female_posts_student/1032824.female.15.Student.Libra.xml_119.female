When I doubt something will happen... it will happen. If I want it to happen no matter how miraculously hard I try.. it never falls perfectly.   Mrs Chua makes a perfect class parent. Unfortunately, she's only our English teacher. If only... =)   On a deeper thought, all the time, I believe that there is always more to the physical. Don't you ever judge a book by its cover. Mrs Tan needs to learn to understand our class. She can't just go around pretending that she 'cares' for our class when all she does is brings us down with her critisisms and negative judgements.  So it is today that a smile kills me.    "Too often we under estimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."  -- Leo Buscaglia
