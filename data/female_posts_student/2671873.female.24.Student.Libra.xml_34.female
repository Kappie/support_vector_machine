I have been sooo busy with work and catching up on sleep that when I do check my email writing on my blog just takes too much time.    Life in N. Ireland is good.  I was recently accepted to a graduate programme that is a 35 week internship/placement all paid.  I just have to find a company to work for.  It starts in October and I could end up in Asia, Australia, America, Canada, or somewhere in the Middle East.  God only knows.  But I made it this far which is a feat.  I have had to do an application, assessment with group work and now have to interview with individual companies.  I also have to start my dissertation before I head back state side in September.  For all of you Americanos there in the states I am gonna be in  Seattle at the end of Sept.  I would love to meet up.  Other than that I am just working insane hours at the Strand Bar here in Derry and trying to get back in shape after my marathon...I have only been running 3 times sine it ended...YIKES!    Well that is my life sorry I haven't been updating more often.
