This means Kelsie gets a secondary and another staff member... and we'll probably cap enrollment by the end of the first week of school.  YAY!  I'm so excited... I just ordered a bunch of stuff from our curriculum dept. for positive reinforcemnt.  Stickers, candy, body glitter, rings, bracelets, cars, airplanes, bubbles... WOOHOO!  I'm awesome... and if my plans go smoothly, then I'm going to BEG some of my friends from UTSA Music Dept. (mainly the steel drum ensemble) to come perform for the kids on a Friday!  :-D  I'm awesome!
