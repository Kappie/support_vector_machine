The problem is, no matter which one I give up one I am giving up something important. Neither one of them are perfect for me. I guess I'm just having fun and it's not right. I don't believe in cheating, and my longer, more committed relationship is with MH, but I don't believe he's even thinking about being faithful. But technically, I haven't cheated on him since we got back together. I haven't slept with EK and I actually don't have any intentions to do so...but I'm lying to EK so that I can avoid confronting it. I am not a cheater. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself or anyone...I guess I just don't believe that anyone has honest intentions toward me anymore. I don't know...I need to be smarter...I don't do this, this isn't me, and I'm hurting myself the most here.
