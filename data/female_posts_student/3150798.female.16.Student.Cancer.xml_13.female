Came out to a 3.25 GPA for the semester, giving me a 3.5 for the year. Not too bad, but I wanted to do better. Hopefully next year will bring some major improvement- I would love to be all A's next year. But that will take some major discipline. I hope I'm up to it. But for now, I'm glad to have saved my 3.5.
