His basements looked identical to my sister's friend Carrie Ann's basement and we ere in it. I was only and saw Cory Z  was on. I looked and saw him in a chat room. He never chats. I really wanted to go to the room but didn't want him to see me. That's about all with that dream.   Then I don't remember everything but I did get to meet the young Brandon from Bardic Winds at a faire.
