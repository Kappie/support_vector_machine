There really is no other way to describe it, the weather is positively shite, my mood is totally down, and even the vibe from the walls is making me feel like the yellow paint is turning gray, so on this crappy Tuesday I have decided to create my own wittle blog.  Yes, that's right, in the midst of a depressing Tuesday I actually found some inspiration to do something.  Weird, eh? Must just be because there is absolutely positively nothing else to do right now.  Or something... *ahem*  Right now, I'm having the most frustrating conversation ever over MSN with my ex-boyfriend... He really needs to grow up.  I'm trying to explain an emoticon to him - yes, that's right, an  emoticon  - and he is arguing for the sake of arguing and basically saying "you're shit wrong, I win". He doesn't even  argue  properly!  And as if he "wins" anything! Good lord... How frikking annoying.   Anyway, moving onwards and upwards to better and less annoying things, I always wonder what it is that people put into these things... I've started a couple before and they've all just fizzled out and faded away because I've got nothing of any importance to say really, nothing that I'm happy letting people I know hear about, and nothing that people I don't know feel the need to read... bleh.... I think I might sign out now, and come back when I've got some more inspiration!  Bunches of love n such, Simbles xo
