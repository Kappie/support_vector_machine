Guess I should explain, especially to math analysis, why I was crying and smiling at the same time!  Well some of those tears r happy tears, cause I've got my dream editor position...managing editor for newspaper!  I've wanted that since freshman year, so I couldn't be happier about that.  Plus, the people I'm workin under are Joe S. and Mallory S. (no, they're not related)...although Joe's gonna be like, "Nichole, go get me a drink, some food" (u get the point) the entire year.  Plus, it's gonna be fun to work w/ Mallory, especially after those *table sharing* moments in chem.  What's even more awesome is that Summer F. is replacing me, and I honestly can't think of a better candidate for the job...I would totally trust her with anything money related, so training her will be a breeze.  Speaking of training, Aaron L.'s training me, which should be interesting Well it sounds like one of the best days of my life...why the heck would I be sad?  I'll tell u why...my beloved O'Gilliam (AKA Mrs Gill) is leaving at the end of this year!!  That's awful! It actually made me cry...ok so I'm a bit weepy sometimes, ok i cry more than most ppl, but still.  Well The Simpsons is on, so I'll leave it at this.  Later.
