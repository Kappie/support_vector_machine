Shawn came home early and we went up to Target to get Brooke a baby shower present and had to get Nick a toy. Shawn picked out, "Taylor"-the turtle. Taylor makes loud funny noises and talks. At first Nick loved it, then he got shy.-being "shy" is his new thing. Now whenever we make Taylor the turtle talk Nick turns his face into a complete frown or what my G Koski call, "Crabby Face." It melts my heart every time and makes me laugh, too. At Target, Shawn also picked up, Along Came Polly. Nick slept this evening though out the entire movie. It is hilarious. One of my favorite parts was learning what,  sharted , means! ;) Hehehehehehe It's a good movie and I recommend it. I want to get back to Shawn and Nick now so I'll blog Sunday. Enjoy the pictures! They are from Nick's nightly bath. Shawn always captures the best pictures. He is such a super dad. Nick  I went and ordered his father's day present. It will take 2 whole weeks to get here!!!!!! That's crazy!!!!
