I can't believe the little shy quiet boy I met in 7th grade has graduated. It's amazing how much we have both changed since then. I just want him to know that I am so proud of him. And Gavin seemed genuinely happy to see me at graduation. He gave me a big hug and that made me so happy.   Then I went to Jon's party and hung out for a while. That part wasn't to bad. We played soccer and stuff. It's too bad I couldn't have stayed there longer. I feel bad that I left after 45 minutes but my mom was waiting in the car.  Then I went to Gavin's party. This is where things started going downhill. I was so happy and excited to go see him. I spent extra time (about 25 minutes extra to be exact) making sure I looked good and everything and I even spent all night last night making him CD's to give him since I have no money to give to him. I get there and what happens? Gavin barely pays any attention to me at all. Way to invite me to your party and then make me feel like complete shit. I mean, I understand that he has other friends to hang out with but Carol and I didn't really know anyone there so it would have been nice to have been talked to for a couple of minutes here and there! And then to top things off some of the people I hate most were there  and  I got hit really hard in the face with a volleyball. It took all my strength to not cry. It hurt so bad (and I'm not just talking about the volleyball). I think I might had a black eye tomorrow from the volleyball though. It just seemed as if Gavin didn't even want me to be there. I feel like complete shit. I had the worst time I've had in a while there and I wish I had stayed at Jon's party longer.  I hate my life.   Today could have been one of the best days I've had in a while. Why do people have to ruin things for me and make me upset when I'm happy?  I hate holding things inside. I can't wait until Emily goes to bed so I can talk to my mom about it and just let everything out and cry. I've been holding back my tears ever since I got to Gavin's party.  Why does my life have to suck so badly? Why don't I have anyone that I can talk to? Why is it that noone wants me around anymore?  Sometimes it just doesn't seem worth it anymore to wake up in the morning.
