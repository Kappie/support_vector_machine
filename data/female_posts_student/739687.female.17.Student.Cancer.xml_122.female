Though I was washing blue dye out of my hair until about 1 or so this morning. That's okay, I skipped 1st and 2nd period. :)  I do that alot...oh well.  Isn't it odd how sometimes you feel so alone in the world. Right now I'm just mad at people in general. People are so FREAKING RUDE! You can't be serious with any of the stupid asses, because if your mood doesn't conform to theirs, they have to be rude to you. I hate people sometimes! Ah well...I don't care anymore. Screw people, I don't want any shitty friends that are gonna step on me, and then run in and be nice when it's convenient for them.  We just got a gas fire thingy for the fireplace. Like, just now. As in, my dad just finished hooking it up. We'd never been able to have anything in the fireplace before, because of my dad's asthma and emphysema. I don't know why we have one now, but okay.  I'm gonna go catch up on all the homework I have. Bye.
