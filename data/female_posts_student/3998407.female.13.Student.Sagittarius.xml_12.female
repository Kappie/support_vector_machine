I really wish someone would give me a back and neck massage! I could really use one! I so badly want the CD coheed and cambria! Because after Raychal told me last night that she liked this one song by them I decided to download it and see if I like it! and I not only like it but i have heard it before and I love it soo freakin much! For some reason my mom doesnt think I have been honest with her and she doesnt believe me that I didnt read her things under her bed! and I really didnt for sure! My mom says she is giving me 200$ to go school shopping and I'm fine with that as long as my dad gives me like way more! HaHa! I hope soo because I think I want to spend somewhere around 500$ or more! Because you can't buy much with 200$ at the stores i like and can fit into the jeans at! I'm planning on shopping at Abercrombie and Fitch, American Eagle, Pac Sun, Zumiez, Alloy, Wet Seal and who knows where else those are the places I know that I want to shop at though!      **~!~**AmAnDa**~!~**
