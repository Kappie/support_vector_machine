But Praise the LORD I slept well for the first time in a long time! YAY!  Had a weird dream where my brother and I were on a trip somewhere and it was  urlLink Halloween  so I was dressed up as Mrs. Linda Muhl (random!) and, like, was wearing a purple shiny fairy's dress (O_o) and had a green pen and all. While we were there this random guy, like, showered me with gifts and said, "Oh,  please  go out with me, Linda!" and that was funny! HA HA! Then I asked him where he lived and he said that he lived in  urlLink Spongebob , Missouri or something like that and I said it just wouldn't work out. But I still got to keep the gifts, I guess? :D    NOTE:  If I find some awesome Christian guy and he asks me out and I met him in Mrs. Muhl's class, that shall be very. scary. Doubt it, but it would be very. scary.  So I got up and had some Banana Nut Crunchness and um... milk *GASP* and I'm not puking up a storm so that's good for a  urlLink lactose-intolerant girlie  like me. And then I got on my PC (apparently) and was on AIM for a bit. Was talking to a friend but then he got all mean or whatever and I needed to get a shower anyway, so I said ttyl! ^_^  Umm... as of late (and probably thanks to that  strange  debutante meeting yesterday) I've really gotten back into the whole nailpolish thing. I mean, the question number three for each occasion in the deb exercise,  What nail polish would be appropriate?  kinda got me to thinking.   So last night I painted my nails on my left hand dark brown and then a few coats of light brown and it somehow turned silver? O_o;; But my other hand... I tried to get my brother to paint it for me, thinking he would do a better job, but... BOY was I  wrong . So that was removed before I went to bed. :)  But I'm looking for pieces of my old huge nail polish collection (I had  urlLink a LOT ); looking for something to match my bathing suit for the ABS (Area Bible Study) I'm going to this Wednesday. It's navy blue with some white stripes and yellow on the top and... I guess you have to see it. ^_^;  But anyway, today is a new day! And I'll probably try to read more of  The Agony  and maybe, if my new glasses come in soon,  urlLink I Kissed Dating Goodbye . That would be awesome! Oh yeah, and  definitely  a work out somewhere in a few hours. If I'm all confused and then work out, everything is so clear and I think so straight and feel so good; it's awesome. But until latah, latah!
