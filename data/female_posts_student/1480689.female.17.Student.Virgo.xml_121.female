I thought it was a friend thing, but it grew to be so much more. We had a great relationship, and then it stopped. Fault by me, (and some by You hehheh)  and we grew apart. Even the first of our meetings after we broke up ( that friday at Palmer Park, where Joey was playing with the Half-burned cecada....oh lord) And we stayed apart, for a while...You avoided me, I got confused and sad. Then, we went to Pirates. Oh good movie, better kiss. Special kiss. And after that, we talked more, we hung out more. We connected better. The Geoff came back. I ran to someone I hadn't seen in 2 months, who had been writing and talking to me all summer. I missed him. And in the process of running, I crushed You. But You stayed there for me. We stayed friends. You didn't shut me out. And things stopped. I was to "choose" and I did. It hurt, all of us in that. But You, You  took me, took my heart, my mind.   What we have now, is something I never thought I'd expierence. I can talk to you about anything. You have shown me respect like no other you have been loyal to me like no other. You have made me feel, special. My Self-Respect has soared, and my faith in people has grown. You give me hope and confidence that I can't find inside myself. Seeing You, hearing You, feeling You, makes everything better. You just make me glow. I can sit in silence with You, and be comepletely comfortable with it.  I feel right with You, and when a bump in the road, we work through it, better than most people, high school couples rather, than I know. The way we interact, is so fun, refreshing and lovely. Yup, lovely. Life, as I see it right now, is lovely. Hands down, you are the best thing i could ever imagine, always imagine.
