That show is hilarious. I want to  marry  Andy Dick. He's so adorable, in a weird old man way.    I'm not sure what I am going to do with myself tomorrow. I think that I am going to call Emily. No wait, I am going to call her. Maybe she and I will go see a movie or something. We'll see, otherwise if she is busy I will call some random person. I'm not sure who it will be but someone. I'm really bummed because I have been wanting to talk to Britt, I mean just to say hello and she what she has been up to, but she's never on when I am. WAHH. It makes me sad. But she will be home soon.    I found a pair of shoes today that I LOVE!! They are black with white polka dots and a pink bow. They are high heeled pumps. Absolutely adorable! Along with many other things that I would buy if I had money. But I am still pushing off the job applications. I just cant seem to get ambition. Maybe I will tomorrow along with working out. We'll see. But I need my mom to help me because I am retarded when it comes to filling them out. I cant answer half the questions. They all scare me.   Oh. I forgot to tell you what my grandma said about my hair being black. Yesterday when she was up for my dads party the first thing she said was "I like the Gothic look". I was in shock, I dont look gothic, all I did was dye my hair black and automatically thats what she thought. Not that I have a problem with Gothic people I just found it weird that that was what she automatically associated me with. Then later that day she told me I look Mexican. I dont look mexican, I'm pale!! That makes it a little difficult and then my aunt chimed in the fact that if i tanned I could look Indian. haha. So I am a Gothic Mexican Indian!! AWESOME!! I rock!!   I want to be a bartender when I turn 18. I was watching the championship on food network and they are freakin' amazing. They just throw around the bottles and can mix 10 drinks in 36 seconds, it was breath-taking. I want to learn to do that, but I cant. I'm not nearly coordinated enough. I drop everything, I'm a huge clutz. Oh well, its one of those things that you like to watch and cant do, along with gymnastics.    I did all of my laundry... Its all done. Even my favorite blankie and my robe! YAY! Nothing smells like cigarettes anymore. And I have a choice from anything to wear tomorrow. That's exciting. That reminds me that I need to go and get my blanket out of the dryer. It amazes me how different a house with AC and a house without it feels. My dad has airconditioning and he always has it running where as my mom doesnt even have the option to open the windows downstairs let alone have airconditioning. But as nice as being cool is, it really dried out my hair and my sinuses were a lot more sensitive there. Here its all natural. I mean I dont even have a fan in my room and yet I am completely content unless its really humid. And having radiators really helps my hair stay healthy. But I'm sad because its so damaged after being at dad's for so long. I dont know I am sure that I can nurse it back to being nice.    I really love this sweatshirt of my brother's. Is that weird? I dont know sometimes people think that I am weird for wearing my brothers sweatshirt but I really consider it mine now. I dont want to give it back, I really like it. Not that that has anything to do with anything important but is anything on here ever really important? Hell No. If it was it wouldnt be on here by me.    I'm really kind of psycho about this blog. It's something that I am always working on. I feel weird if I dont write on it all the time, even if I have nothing to say I still write something. Every entry's so random and unusual and they show every side of me. Its weird that I am so obsessive about this. Oh well. Its something that makes me feel better.   Well it is time for bed. I want to get up early tomorrow and workout.   Nighty Night   -gabby
