So I went out with him for 3 days and then broke up with him, thinking we'd be better as friends. Well, I broke his heart. He hated me for about a year. He got another girlfriend, Kari, and I got another boyfriend, Josh. So just recently I started talking to Jake again. At first, he rejected me, saying that he hated me and he wanted me to stay away. What I didn't know, is that in pushing people away, he is really testing them to see if they will come back, because he wants them to. So he had  liked  me the entire time. Even though he  LOVED  Kari. *** I had been with Josh for about 11+ months and actually already had a plan to break up with him, because he had no job, no car, his parents did everything for him, and he didn't respect me or my feelings. I needed someone new. So then Jake informed me of his feelings for me. I was thrilled! Except for one thing...he was still with Kari. The thing is, Jake and Kari had their past history of multiple break-ups, and in a relationship like that, it usually continues to happen. Unfortunately for Jacob, Kari was the one who kept breaking up with him. Well, as soon as I came into the picture, something horrible happened to Jake, Kari not only broke up with him again, but she broke up with him for another guy, Brenden. Jake was so upset. He came to me for help. I offered to be his friend, but he told me he needed more than that. So I told him of my plans to break up with Josh. He took it the wrong way at first, thinking that I was breaking up with Josh for him. But I reassured him that I had already had these plans. Another thing, though, is that I wasn't planning on breaking up with Josh for another week, and I wanted to wait at least 2 weeks before going out with anyone else, just out of respect for Josh. But Jake didn't want to wait. He wanted someone NOW. So the next day, he went back to Kari. Grr...I was so mad. I knew she'd hurt him again, I could feel it. Well, the next 2 days come around and BAM!...she breaks up with Jake and goes back to Brenden. Well, this time Jake didn't have to wait long, because I broke up with Josh that night. Earlier than I had planned. So Jake asked me out the next day, which was a Thursday, and I told him 'yes'. So Friday, we talked online and on the phone all day. And Friday night, after he got out of work, he came to my house after my dad left for work. He got here at about 9:50 and left at 10:30. It was one of the best nights I'd had. We made plans for Saturday night to play lazer-tag. Well, when he got home, he got online and told me he needed more time, because he still loved Kari, but he wanted to stay friends. So Saturday, we still went and played lazer-tag. It was THE BEST night of my life. So when we were done playing, we hopped in the car (shh...) and went to the KFC, A Then we went back to the lazer place where my mom picked me up and I went home. Well, Sunday rolls around and Jake goes to see the movie SHREK 2 with Kari. Then he gets home and tells me that he had the most wonderful time with her and that she's gonna break up with Brenden soon to go back out with Jake. And Jake told me I'd never have another chance. OMG! I freaked out. I was going to kill myself. I couldn't take it. I was crying so hard. I called Josh, but he didn't care, so I called Dean-o. I talked to him for almost 2 hours and he totally calmed me down (thanks, man). So then I'm over it. Monday, I get up in the morning, get online, and talk to Jacob. I play around with him like a friend would, I was trying to be so nice, and he freaked out on me. He told me if I was going to be a stupid dyke, then he was leaving, so he signed off. Later, he called me, and he said, "Kristelle, I want you to stay away from me". No pain there, so I hung up on him. And I was just peachy, a little upset, but I was alive. Well, that same night, Jake calls me up, crying. He said that he had gone up to the park where Kari was working the concession stand to say 'hi'. But when he got there, Kari was working with Brenden. Kari got upset and yelled at him saying that he put her in a very hard position. So she said she'd never go back to him. Jake was going to kill himself. It was horrible listening to him like that. I felt so bad. So he asked if he could come over again. I said that he could after my dad left for work, so he did. He came over, jumped at my basketball net and broke it, lol, and then the mosquitos were biting so much that we got in his car to talk. So when we were in the car, he told me that he was genuinely sorry for what he did to me and he asked me back out, and I said...'yes'. Well, that was yesterday, last night. Today, we met Jennifer Granholm, the Governor of Michigan, at the Train Depot in Durand. And all Jake could do was talk to Kari. Uhm...I understand what he's feeling and that he's not totally over her, I'm not expecting him to bounce right back, he was engaged to her, no less. But it does hurt me. He told me not to worry, that he won't do what he did before. I trust him. But I'm not so sure I trust her. She was threatening me today. Saying that she'll fight to get him back. But honestly, if she loves him so much, why wouldn't she just keep him when she had him? She keeps hurting him so much. I know I'm the rebound girl, but I don't hurt Jake. He goes back to her knowing that she'll do it again. It's not my fault she screws things up. I don't want it to happen again. I won't go back next time.  Someone help.
