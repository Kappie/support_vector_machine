See, fun enough to use made up words for.. At any rate, I don't even know how to describe him because he is so special. He is totally selfless and caring, but not in a sissy wierdo kind of way. We aren't completely opposites, but we aren't the same, but I don't know. The only thing that is great is the usual stuff that bothers me and makes me worry doesn't. And its hilarious how he is so concerned with Michelle (best friend for those who haven't met her yet) finding flaws in him so things aren't like "too good to be true". I don't know, I like the way I feel when I talk to him and .... I'm gonna stop all this talk because I think I'm rambling a little too much here. (Sorry Rob  *wink wink*)  Besides that... more randomness. I haven't been able to get passed an idea that is so simple: Time has never stopped for anyone. Even Jesus was a slave to it. There has never been anyone who didn't have to turn old, who lived forever, remained a child for eternity, etc. It's a fascnating notion really that everything must give way. Water can dissolve absolutely anything through time. Time is so great there is no way of expressing its greatness. How long is infinity and forever? This does help one's everyday struggles as well. Though we may be completely finite, there is comfort in knowing "this too shall pass." Everything must come to an end and a new beginning is waiting to get started. Pain can not last forever, niether can sorrow. Though life is full of these emotions, take solace that everyone is on this adventure and carries the same fears and loathings as torches through the endless tunnel of life. They are not permenant and do come and go like other emotions. Some go on to the end where the light has teased and begged them. Others are weary and have stopped on the sides to catch their breath. And still there are those who have stopped all together going or even starting and trying.
