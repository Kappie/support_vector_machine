Pretty full day of being crouched over various books, struggling to keep the eyes open during the laborious discussions of expectation damages and encouragements to breach for Contracts and the difference between some courts' requirements for an overt act in characterizing the offense of attempt for Criminal Law.  A nap helped.  The two Torts assignments put me behind a bit, but I trudged back to school around 8 to prepare for Civil Procedure.    Coming home to a request to have a copy of my Motion to Suppress Tangible Evidence ready for the Advanced Research and Writing professor added a nice finish.    Now just surfing nearly-forgotten web sites and checking email at a leisurely pace; never would have considered these activities of luxury, but they feel pretty indulgent tonight.
