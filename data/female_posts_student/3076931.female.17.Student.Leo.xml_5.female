I'm looking forward to working with all of you and i'm SOO ready to get started on our awesome yearbook!!  well enough yearbook stuff! Nothing too eventful has happened to me. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. Prom is this weekend! yay? well..not really..for losers like me who don't have dates. heh. oh well. My parents leave for New Orleans tomorrow. yeah..party at trina's. They're going to my 3rd favorite city, but it's okay..i get the whole house to myself.   This weekend when i was hanging out with my friend carrie...my old friend david called and he came over and hung out with us.  David's a really nice guy. I liked him for maybe a week..and then confessed to him and he told me he didn't want to lose the friendship we had. I cried to him on the phone, and now as i look back at that, i feel so stupid and embarrassed. Oh well.  I think he's the only guy that i've ever liked that's actually a "good guy", so that was a change. Well after our talk..we stopped talking. And i did realize that i actually didn't like him..i now see him as more like a brother. So it was a nice surprise when he called me. It was nice. He's a really good guy. One of the few i know. which leads into my next thought....  Are there really ANY good guys out there? Because i'm seriously starting to think that all guys are assholes. Maybe i'm just meeting all the wrong ones. I don't think i could ever trust a guy, no matter how nice he was. Guys only want one thing..and one thing only..SEX. ahh yes..it's so TRUE!! I guess guys can't help it.  It's like this hunger that they have to feed. I'm starting to think sex is the only thing that's on a guy's mind. I mean okay sex is great (so i hear..)...but come on..there is more!! I dunno. It sucks. Guys suck. I need more luck in the guy department. I need a guy. bah. SOMEBODY HELP ME
