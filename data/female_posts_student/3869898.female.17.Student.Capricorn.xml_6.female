Bring me a cute nice boy.. who cares! And someone kill all the bitches, hores, and skanks...they polute the world...Damn! Well who knows maybe i will find myself a nice person in San Diego. I hope this weekend helps me out hopefully...I just need i break from all of this! Well the good thing now is that Karen is happy so maybe she will help me out here! We can't both be sad...we would go crazy. My body hurts so bad from cheer....hopefully it means muscle growth and fat loss!
