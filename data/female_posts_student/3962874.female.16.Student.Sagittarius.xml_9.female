He never really dated until he met my mom when he was 18. I guess he was in love, although, he probably had no idea what other kinds of people were out there because she was his first girlfriend. My mom grew up with two sisters. She was the youngest, and she was a very chubby redhead. The next oldest sister was a model and very pretty. She looked up to her and loved her and even tried to borrow her clothes. But she didn't get too omuch attention from anyone, except her dad, who eventually got divorced and he died. My mom was into drugs by the time she was 12. She smoked, did marijuana, and tried many other things, one time she took acid and ended up walking 5 miles to a park to go on the swings. She continued these habits and somehow met my dad, I guess things changed with her because they were really happy, had kidsand lived happily for a while. Wemoved to an island andthat is where I grew up. We built a houseand eventually they began to fight.Now they are divorced. I guess mom was with other men and she even got back to marijauna. It's probably been about a year. Dad is happy, his buisness is going pretty good and he is engaged to a great woman. She's really nice, she has two kids and is a retired doctor. She is full of energy which is great for my dad, he'll live longer because of her. My mom on the other hand, she has a stalker, two boyfriends and no permanent job. She wants to own a painting buisness, doing faux murals and things, and I think eventually she will. But she is ging through a hard spot, I think she wishes bad things didn't happen. But they do. My sister is 13 years old and she is all grown up. Physically. She has the body of Giselle Bundchen (a little less boobs and not as tall yet but she's 13!) My mom spoils her in every way possible. I still love her. My brother is 18 and not doing muchwith his life. He wants to be a graphic designer. When he was 16 my dad bought him a volkswagen gti, and when he was 17 he bought him a porshe. It needed a little work on the inside and a little tlc, but it was a nice car. When he got it my brother said "Dad, that's my dream car." Sure enough, he doesn't care about his dreams too much because he still has the car in the garage. He doesn't drive it and he rarely works on it/takes care of it. Dad is paying for everything to fix it up and when he's finished, my brother is going to sell it to pay for school tuition. A few days ago, my dad bought him another car. It is a Subaru Impreza (my brothers latest dream car) and he told my brother that he will sell it to him for cheap. My brother has been the most excited I think I have ever seen him. Amazingly anough I am proud to say that yesterday my brother told me that he was applying at a local restaurant (his first job) and he also signed up to go to school at the local technical college. I think and hope that he is starting to live his life.
