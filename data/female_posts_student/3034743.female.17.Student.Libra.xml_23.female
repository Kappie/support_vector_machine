Chubbs (we got that from Happy Gilmore) and Holli came over and we watched a movie. Oh, they also colored in coloring books. It was funny. Then we got bored so we decided to call Josh. Yeah, that was kind of interesting. Josh thought it was weird, I'm sure. Oh well. Who already doesn't think me and my friends are weird? Hmm...not much else happened yesterday. That was about it.
