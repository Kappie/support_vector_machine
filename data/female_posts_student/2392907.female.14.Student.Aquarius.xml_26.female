I don't think i could eat much more." "OK," says Adam, glad that she declined the offer, because he felt that the £37 left on his credit card wouldn't really benefit from buying another bit of fancy cake. "Yeh, me niether." "This is a nice restaurant," says Jane.  "Yeh. Yup. Yah. Yes. Yupity -" "Adam." "Sorry." Silence. "Erm.. check!" Adam yells, waving his hand around. Jane closes her eyes.  Just concentrate on the hair and don't think about his weird arm waving movements , she instructs herself. The annoyed waiter comes with his nose in the air. He places the bill smugly in front of Adam, with the hope that Adam won't be able to afford it.  £36.90  Oh good,  thinks Adam,  Not only have i got enough, but I can even buy myself a packet of those funny alien crisps as well!  He pulls out his Tesco's credit card and places it on the little plate with the mints holding the curled bill down.  "Thank you, sir," the waiter says, taking the card and walking off. He comes back with the card and a small packet of mints wrapped in green tissue paper each for the two. Jane notices that hers has some kind of serial code. Something like 02089493556 but she doesn't take any notice of it and pops a mint into her mouth.  "Erm, are you cold?" wonders Adam aloud, as they walk to their cars. "Um, not really." "Well i am," he says, and hugs her close.  He smells of.. well,  man . Hmm,  she decides.  But man's good.   She smells of.. summer. Wow. This is amazing because I've never actually known what summer smells like before.  Adam decides to pretend that his car is round the corner so he won't ahve to go through the embarrassment of introducing his tatty old thing to her.  "Yeh, just around the corner, uh huh." "OK." Jane turns around to face him. "You know, tonight was nice. Really nice." Adam blinks.  What am i supposed to say? Without her thinking i'm all weird and wimpy? I gotta retain the machoism.  "Erm, yuh, it was good." He closes his mouth, not daring to say more.  is he gonna kiss me at all? Am i gonna have to kiss her? What if she doesn't want me to? I hope that evil waiter doesn't come poking around again... I wish he would get on with it. Oh crap, what if he does? Aaah! What am I meant to do? What would Ryan do? Hold her hand? OK, I'll hold her hand.  Adam takes both Jane's hands.  Ok.. so he took my hands. Woah, he's hot. I mean, his hands are hot. OK, so what do I do now? Smile. I gotta smile. Come on man, smile!  Adam forcibly smiles at Jane, bearing nearly all his teeth.  Oh my god. He's smiling at me now. This should be a good thing. Why am I so freaked out then? Must be because he's showing me all his teeth. Why is he doing this?? Oh crap. I said smile, not grin like a madman! Great, you've blown it now. Close your mouth, Adam. JUST CLOSE YOUR MOUTH.  Adam's mouth comes abruptly to a close.  Woah. He can get serious pretty quick. Was it because of me? Do i repulse him? Oh god! Oh God, she looks scared now. Quick, do something. Anything.  Adam closes his eyes.  Why is he closing his eyes? Is he going to kiss me? I'm not ready. You could have done ANYTHING but close your damn eyes! What, did you think the whole problem would just disappear if you couldn't see it??? God, Adam, you are useless... Maybe I should just go now. Say good bye or something. There is something up with this guy.   "Um Adam, it was really great seeing you again, and dinner was really nice. But I have to go now. I'm getting a bit cold and I really should be getting back." "Um. Ok." Jane looks at Adam.  What the hell am I supposed to say to her??  "Well, it was.. erm, nice. And it would be, um, nice, to see you again. Have a, err, nice, um, journey home. You - um, you're, you're really, erm, nice." "Err.. yeh? Well you're nice too." "Well.. um.. see you some time then!" "Yeh. Bye." And Jane gets into her car. Adam starts to walk to the end of the street to wait until she is gone.  Jane sits still in her Lexus. Walking, walking, walking away. She decides to start the car. As Adam hears the revving of the engine, he looks back at her and sees her car, but she cannot see him. He carries on walking. Jane is about the step on the pedal. She stops. Gets out. Runs to Adam. Kisses him. Gets kissed back.  Goes home.  I know that goodbye means nothing at all
