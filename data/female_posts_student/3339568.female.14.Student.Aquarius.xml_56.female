But I joined dance, yay - cool. I like dance, Hannah W, Mel, Jacki, Julia and I decided to make a dance for the Middle School Performng Arts Evening this year seeing as it is our last year in the middle school! And we r also trying to get on the committe, which basically means we get to be the audition judges and bludge class 4 ages! Yay. but the main reason I wrote was 2 say, that now half the small group know a secret about me now. Sitting in a warm comfy room must kind of stimulate these kind of confessions and relisations by other people. And it must bring on the fights as well.   Mel and I had a fight (but dw its all resolved now, im used 2 fighting with mel neway we do it all the time but usually ova stupid little things  - hey mel i hope u don't mind me writing all this, please don't get angry, i mean well) about, well this is silly, it was about Luke (hey Luke if ur reading!) Mel was looking through mi phone and she found like the hundred millon messages in there that Luke has sent me, but i had deleted most of them, but not the most recent ones, like the last 2 weeks or so so there were bout 12 or sumthing in there (yes Luke u really DO send me that many messages!) but they all happened to hav a bit in there bout Mel, so she was annoyed that I was talking to Luke about her "all the time", but it actually wasn't i told her, (those messages were very incriminating) just lately because i needed someone to talk 2 and there was no-one really who wanted 2 listen cept luke (thanks luke!) cuz i usally talk 2 mel because she is mi best friend and all, but we were havin problems so i just needed advice but she was a a bit pissed about me telling him this stuff. Ahhhh, well, its all resolved but yeh. Fun night overall. Who's coming to Ernie's Big Night next week? Blogging off, Beth  Ok, im just looking at mi Mini Magnum stick and it says "Feeling Dizzy" Random, these sticks r random. They use sex 2 advertise wayyyyy 2 much i say, not that the aforementioned comment had nething much 2 do with sex, but meh, it triggered mi random train of thought. Bloggin off 4 REAL this time, Beth
