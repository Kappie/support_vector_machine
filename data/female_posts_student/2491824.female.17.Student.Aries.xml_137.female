The idea of still having five straight years of school bums me out. I read an article today saying that when people take a year off they always do better in college no matter what they do during that year off. I really need that. I'll probably just get a job and save for college. I hope I can get a decent job. I couldn't stand having to work some shitty job like one at McD's or a place like that. ...Even a mailroom job at some place in D.C. sounds kind of interesting.... I also need to figure out what the hell I want to do--like what kind of career I want when I get out of college...  I got my hair cut tonight. It's a bit below my shoulders now. ..Quite a change. I think I like it though; it still feels too weird to tell. It frames my face a lot. I think I like that...  I'm supposed to get my digital camera on Monday. Get ready for dumb pictures. :)  Oh, and what's up with the column on the right? ..I don't know. I don't feel like figuring it out... Hopefully it will fix itself, again. :)
