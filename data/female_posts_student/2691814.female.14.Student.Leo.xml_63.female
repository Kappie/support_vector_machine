First we move here...keith gains  what he wants-living in beautiful florida and meeting girls while i get my friends taken away from me...i can't see them anymore. Many other things that I enjoy  are taken away from me while keith gains everything. When i found out i was moving again! I can't go to DP and my audition was totally gone, every chance that i had of making myself into a great dancer was down the drain.  And today, ya, my guitar is taken away from me. I didn't do anything and their like...we're gonna have to put your guitar in the shop for a while. DAMMIT!   But i kinda understand>i shouldn't be saying this. My family is struggling with money and my dad's like working two to 3 jobs just to make enough money to pay just the bills. And if dad doesn't get enough money to pay the lights we wont have them. Ya just a bunch of total bull shit is goin on. I can't see ppl in wv i can't dance i can't play my guitar. How am i gonna get good at guitar if i don't have one? I learned a Jason Mraz song and i was getting better at it and now my guitar is gone. NOw im stuck at home....cuz the parents are away. I have to watch the freaking house. I wonder if i can apply for a job at publix....your aloud to work there you know lol.  I just wish my dad had a better job. I hear the same thing over and over. We're moving for dads job. He'll make more money so we can do more things. Gosh they've lied to me more times than i can count.  its just sad.
