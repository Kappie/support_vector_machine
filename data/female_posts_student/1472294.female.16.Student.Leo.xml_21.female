I mean I am not angry or fustrated at the 39 year- old PR guy (Lim Something, something...) but WE ARE JUST  A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM FREEDOM ! ! ! But I tell you, the most funny and amazing part was that my 2 very cute friends did not even know th news UNTIL I told them around 10am today. One was shock, the other, calm, of course, she is also a malaysian. Hey... no hard feelings or meant to hurt anybody or country.... Hope that Singapore can be free from SARS ! ^_^
