Grrr...Montana weather...grrr....Uh yeah...anyways...I just got back from a graduation party and there were alot of people there. So many people in fact that I began to have a panic attack and hid in the kitchen the whole time. I have a phobia of strangers. I realised the true extent of this phobia today. Yeah just got back from Bozeman. Poor Brit...lost both his games. I saw Paul's team play for about 15 minutes too. Yep good stuff. Uhhh anyway....really isn't much else to say...My flute playing has been very bad as of late. I can't even begin to double tounge my 16th note run on my all state audition peice. It really is begining to frustrate me. I can't even move my fingers well enough to type this right now! I think I'm gonna take a break before I practice any more...
