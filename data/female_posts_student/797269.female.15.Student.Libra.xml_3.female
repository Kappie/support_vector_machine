After two weeks of sleeping till 12 and doing nothing but go out at night, waking up at 7:50 and spending the day with little girls who all want piggy backs and french braids is just excellent. Miss Betty died in January. It would be weird enough to go to camp with out her there, but her daughters decided about 2 weeks after her death to sell her house and all her land. Obviously camp is still going on but we're in a new location. It's much smaller and in the woods so the bugs are intense. The worst part is all the little things we won't have any more. The big bridge, walks to Big Boys, and everything else will soon be gone forever. :(
