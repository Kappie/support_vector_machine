In simple terms: poor working conditions... lots of noise, lots of dust, lots of large pieces of concrete and the like floating about.  Anyhow, this means that this computer is far more oftenly in use.  So anyhow, I have to call tech support to get my laptop online.  U haven't bothered so far because, well, this computer works just fine.  Problems with me having to call tech support include the following: I am lazy.  Furthermore, I don't know WHICH tech support to call.  See, I could call Comcast.  They're our internet provider.  But then, I could call Linksys.  They make our wireless router.  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.  I don't know what to doooooooooooooooooooo.  Okay, you care.  Shutting up now.
