Celebrate as you will!  Secondly, this weekend I just visited the Austin bunch.  We had a great time.  Shawn's bro had his birthday this weekend, so Friday night we all ate barbecue and cake in celebration.  It was fun.  It was fun to hang out with that group again.  I brought some Smirnoff Ice (for the drinkers) and I believe we finished all but one out of 12.  So, it was good times.  This last Thursday (5 Sept) I got my first tattoo.  It's a froggy that looks like he's hanging onto my leg.  Ya know, I'm going to name him eventually, but I am still thinking of a name.  I have already established that the frog is male.  I don't know why.  He just is!  :-)  Anyhow, any suggestions may be sent to me.  Now as for the whole, me doing a blog thing... I don't normally "jump on the bandwagon" so to say, as far as doing what everyone else does.  BUT, this seems like a good way to keep people updated as to what I'm doing, being that I don't normally take the time out to individually chat with people online anymore.  It's not that I'm lazy, either.  It's just simply that I'm not at the computer long enough to talk to like, 5-6 people everynight... or every 2 nights.  So, this seems like a good way to post stuff that's going on, and then ya know... kill like 5-10 birds with one stone.  ;-)
