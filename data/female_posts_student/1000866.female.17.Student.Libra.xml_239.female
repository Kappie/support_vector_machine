I didn't feel like I was as upset as I should be, and I think because my Grandma gave me The Sound of Music, and because she liked it too, and since I watched it, it's triggoring memories, and I want to talk to her again and I know I can't. I just really miss her right now. It's hard, because I want to talk about it with my mom, but I don't want to make her upset too. Oh well. We're going to Meijer now because...everyone was busy so no one could go see fireworks, and whatnot. I'm not really a huge fan of fireworks anyway. I mean, I like them, but...I can do without them. I guess maybe it was that accident I had when I was 6...  Don't want to remember that...I'm out of here. So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night...
