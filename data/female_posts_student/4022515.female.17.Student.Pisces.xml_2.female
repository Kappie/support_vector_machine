I know I hurt you and I knowI fucked up but you cant lie to everyone about where you are (I think ur embaressed for people to know ur with me) make out with me, be all over me and expect me to donothing and wait. You still tell me you love me... And I will wait for you, but I'm just saying, it blows. You gotta make a choice sooner or later. Just remember I love you. Everyone else thinks it'll work out, everyone but you.
