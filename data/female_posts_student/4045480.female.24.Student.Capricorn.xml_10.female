I had dreams of lounging by the pool studying, hanging with my friends, enjoying summer. Instead I was treated to an extremely early fall. It feels like winter in Florida.  My week really didn't go as planned, but nothing ever does. I spent way too much money, shopping therapy helped me cope with the weather. I spent a bit of time with my sister, which is always good, partied, went to a Cubs game, overall a stellar week. Then what is eating me? Nerves? Yes. Exhaustion? Yes. Barometer induced coma? Most likely. I dunno, I just have felt kind of blah all week. Like I was thinking time would stand still for me or something. Like this week would just magically extend into two, or a month. In college I perfected procrastination, but this is ridiculous. Another busy day tomorrow, maybe I'll get some Chemistry time in, I better, student teaching officially begins Monday. I'm nervous, I think, about more than just starting this. I know I'll be fine, it is just that this is it. No more screwing around, biding my time. I have to actually apply for jobs this month, start teaching, begin what I hope to be a long and fulfilling career. I'm scared I guess. It just seems so finite, so set, so unchangeable, and yet I know from experience you can't assume anything. I think back to the pre-test jitters I have had over the years, the anticipation of new school years, nervousness about passing finals in college, nerves about graduating on time and target, and somehow I lived through all of it no worse for wear. This just feels different, scarier somehow, I guess because I've never experienced anything like this before. I have no real basis for comparison. It feels something like being graded on performance of how well I practice something. After all that's what this is, practice for the real thing. I guess I better get used to it, because in the real world I'll be continually graded on performance of myself and my students. I guess I figured if I avoid dealing with it, maybe I could anchor time to this spot, and prevent the inevitable. I know that is all to silly for words, "time marches on, and soon you realize it's marching across your face." -Dolly Parton, Steel Magnolias. Great flick  In all seriousness, that's really what stopped me from doing what I had been planning to do for weeks, months even. I could blame it on outside forces, lack of opportunity due to time spent doing other things, school, boys, family, friends, work, etc. But all that would be BS, it was all me, dragging my feet, trying to stop time. Now I'm going to have to really be on my toes, constantly have my nose in the book, constantly be reviewing and checking and rechecking. Not that I wouldn't, or don't do that anyway, I've always been a little obsessive compulsive when it comes to things like succeeding in school. And I do want to succeed, and I will, I know I will. Getting there, though half the fun, is never easy, and in my case never without a bit, no a barrel full of nerves.
