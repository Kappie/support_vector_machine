I think my life is starting to be more like that again. Because I'm letting it. And because drama is overrated.  Looking up quotes...it's rather fun.  He who knows does not speak. He who speaks does not know.  -Lao-tzu   Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.  -Erica Jong   *Manda told me that one today...and isn't it so true?*   The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.  -e e cummings   Man is distinguished from all other creatures by the faculty of laughter.  -Joseph Addison   *I'd have to say that man is distinguished my many more things than just laughter.*   I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.  -Oscar Wilde   Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self.  -Cyril Connolly   *Ahh...I love that quote. It's very true...and I think there are certain people who should think on that one.*   You ask me why I do not write something....I think one's feelings waste themselves in words, they ought all to be distilled into actions and into actions which bring results.  -Florence Nightingale   *In a way, I suppose that's true...but words are a safe harbor to passive people.*   You have to know how to accept rejection and reject acceptance.  -Ray Bradbury   We do not write because we want to; we write because we have to.  -W. Somerset Maugham   Well, I'm done now. Au revoir crazies.
