We talked and she gave me a present that she picked up for me while she was on vacation. Woo red n black tanktop! Love it! :D Its great. Then she hung out here and round 3:30 we left for Spencer. We had a great time. We went to Shoppers and found cute tank tops. They are fun! They have hoods and are just great. Then we went to Wal-Mart n places and went out to eat at KFC. Ahh chicken....Then we went to the mall. Kim and I decide to go to White Chicks and Julie and James go to Harry Potter. So we had an extra hour to walk around..so we just went to different stores and all the sudden a group of 3 guys walk by and say "Hey hey..." We just laughed and kept goin. Then another group of 3 guys came by and said "Hey!" We laughed again. The second group of guys then droped a dime by us so we'd pick it up n stuff so we'd have to bend over infront of them...but we didn't we just kept goin. Then we ran into the first group again. Kim and I were wearing pink n red shirts so they started calling us that. They did atleast 3 times. It was interesting. So we had a total of 6 guys hitting on us tonight....*twitch* So then we went to the movie and one of the guys was in there and he kept lookin back at us. I quickly put on the band sweatshirt to represent that I was TAKEN. Yeah. The movie was great. Kim and I laughed alot. I haven't had that much fun in a long time...we just laughed none stop! Great stuff....so then we got home and I stayed at her house for a lil while and I just got home...so yeah that was my interesting, fun, girls night out.
