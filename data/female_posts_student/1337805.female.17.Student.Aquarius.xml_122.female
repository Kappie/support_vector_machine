I just wanted to see who was online, and if someone I really wanted to talk to signed in, I could see, and talk to them. I expressed my wishes for people not talking to me, and told everyone I didn't feel like talking, so please don't talk to me. Or else I would block you.   One of my now not good friends kept talking to me, claiming she could help out, and to talk to her. I ignored her. Then she messaged me, saying I was a horrible person for ignoring her, why wont I just talk to her, etc, etc. I blocked her. I had given her enough warnings and she still continued to bother me. Then she emailed me.  She didn't understand why I was so upset about not going to Fall Con, even though I have explained the importance many times. She called it a stupid SEMINAR. SEMINAR.   Any Unitarians out there who read my blog and know what importance a con is, of any kind, would know my pain and hurt, and disgust when she called Fall Con a seminar. It's more than just a seminar. There's workshops. Worship. The dance. Touch groups. Cuddle puddles. Marshmellow fights (with sanford). Staying up all night. Con flings. Hanging out with people you only see a few times a year. And I really wanted to see people from last year. Super bad. It's upsetting.  I explained this all to her before, and she still doesn't understand. So she sends me this email:   ok kiwi. Why are you being so mean? i am like one of your friends? i dont think the real kiwi would do that to one of her friends. Thats not you. Now please stop it. i hate it when youre like this, and over what? A SEMINAR. big whoop.chill out. there will be more. please UNblock me. dont be an evil kiwi. stop being angry.Take a chill pill. please.   I email her back, asking to PLEASE leave me alone. And get some repsect and listening skills because she is clearly lacking of them. I was very mad at this point too. She quickly emails me back this:   KIWI?! what the fuck?! why are u so pissed off? ur a good friend of mine and i dont wanna loose you! and im sorry, semenar conference.. same thing to me. it hurts me to hear you say stuff like Get Lost, and fuck off. Why are u so angry at me? im only trying to help. Why do you hate me so? and i think i have enough sensitivity thank you very much you have no fucking idea. MY DAD DIED FOR CHRISTS SAKES. i was only 11! i dont need anymore greif from you kiwi. and im not reaming u out. thanks for crushing me again kiwi. Thanks alot. Just because YOURE pissed off. Someones trying to help you. Thanks kiwi. Thanks for crushing what strong part was left in my heart. Thanks alot.   I'm not going to bother responding to this email because I don't think there is anything to respond to. It's going to take me a long time to add her again too. If she only read my name, and everything I was telling her, and my away message, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
