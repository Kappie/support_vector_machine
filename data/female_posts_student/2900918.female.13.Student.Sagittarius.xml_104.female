[exaggeration] lets see, i downloaded these fonts:      "eight track": this was downloaded at  urlLink soup-Faerie's site  earlier ago          "baby kruffy": i like this one, was the first one i downloaded from  urlLink that free fonts site , that site is really gud, so check it out         "skater dudes": this is okay i guess, its kinda cute         "punk ass bitch": i wanted to find that "blink-182" font they have on their latest cd, but i didnt noe its name, this has a similar 'scruffed-up' look, so i decided to download this one.         "damn noisy kids": i think y'll agree with me on this one, it has a 'felt-pen' look. its very defining, so its kinda cool.         this has that 'living pink tequilas' look, which is the theme of my first blog skin. it has a rebellic, freestyle look. need i say more?         u're probably wondering y its backgrd is not yellow, well, cuz the font itself is greyish, and when u put it under yellow, it looks faint. this one's very nice, very sketchy[lolx!]
