Nobody understands a pirates mind, most are not just mindless people who go stealing things and killing people.  Did You hear about when i sacked Nassasu Port without even firing a shot.  I did that to avoid casualties, mate.  Also, Im not like Barbossa, savvy.  He got what he want by killing.  Did you know that the cannons on my ship, when i was captain, were not used at all on ports but on the daily firieng against another pirate ship to see which where more powerful nines (usually wagered on a case of rum).  And, love, im sorry about the "baka" comment i realize it is that same as me saying "savvy".  (still calm but with a little more force) Never insult my rum, telling someone not to try rum is...is...blashphamy.  If CJ wants to try it, than he sure can, love.  Also, ever think that it could help with the whole cancer thing????
