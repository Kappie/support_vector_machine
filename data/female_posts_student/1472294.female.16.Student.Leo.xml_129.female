ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LEFT, THEIR SPIRITS TO LIVE SEPARATELY WILL BE EMBEDDED DEEP IN OUR HEARTS.... }*  That was the message I have wrote and I hope the Iran twins will be happy in heaven. It is so sad to see the news, everybody was crying and tears as big as diamonds were silently rolling down their cheeks.   Ok, on a much happier tone... I have bought the i- weekly, the chinese magazine that is Mediacorp's NOT Mediaworks. And I bought the cover with Edison and Ah- Sa. They looked so loving. (-_-;) Anyway, the other cover looked cool and mature with Ekin and Ah- kiu. Aaahhh...... I did not have enough money, if not I would have bought both covers. *blush*
