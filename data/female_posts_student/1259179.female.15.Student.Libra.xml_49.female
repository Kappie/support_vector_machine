Now I have 2 days to get ready mentally, physically and houselly (yea I just invented a word).  I will start my crazy 2 days with an early birthday present. I am going for my Spa Facial and a pedicure.  A Spa Facial is a facial and a massage all in one.  It will make me feel good....yippee  Anyways, I feel great.  I weaned myself off my anti-depressants and for the first time in 3 years, I actually am thinking clear.  My family Doctor knew about it tho.  Please, ask your doctor first..  So off I go doing Houselly things until my heaven filled 3 hours so.................Be Good
