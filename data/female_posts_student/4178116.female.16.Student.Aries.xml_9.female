I wanted people to read my blog, not because you knew of him or because he asked you to take a look, I wanted to write my true feeling concerning my life and life itself. It's really cool to be able to express myself in a constructive way, but if you don't think I'm interesting that's okay, I just want to write about what I know, not about who I know.
