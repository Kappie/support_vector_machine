Tomorow is soo much fun! I am to go to Sauble/South Hampton, which with my luck won't happen! lol! Again I am being negitive. NOTE TO SELF: Stop being so negitive!Yesterday was supposed to be so much fun due to the party for Hilary, yeah that didn't work out. I went with Nat Ack. We felt sooo left out! So to make things better, (and whoa Nelly were they ever better!)Jess me and nat went and saw the Notebook. It is with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams SOOO GOOD! It was so sad yet so happy at the same time. I LOVED IT!!! Nat and Jess are good company. We are planning to go and see Harry Potter togther next weekend! It is soo hot today, which is odd, and perplexing at the same time. It has been soo cold for soo long that hot days are forigen to me. I like warm to medium hot days.Which odly enough is the same way I like my steak. Warm being replaced with well.So I like my steak well to medium well. That is so off topic. What is my topic? Oh ya weather!! I don't like that topic. Lets move on. Sarrah is back in town! Hoccha!!!YAY that will make for a FUN SUMMER!!! I am all crampy due to the fact that the painters are in! Eww. I have decided to talk and type in some french and using cool British slang. I am into that at the moment, one day Eva and I spent the whole days using accents. Now I must go. I spent the whole day tanning on my deck, so naturally the sun made me drained and tired so I must veg out (slack off, do nothing) on the couch for the rest of the day. Bye my loverlys. Days to Evas cottage:11! (Yay and Double cool with Knobs!)Hoccha. Author:Eve
