And I was looking over everything that’s always there and I read my “random proverb” and usually I don’t think much about them…they’re obvious things like “its better to light a candle than curse the darkness” or something. But that day I got a proverb I really thought about. “Live your own life, for you will die your own death”-Latin Proverb. And I didn’t like it. Because I don’t think we really live our own lives. I don’t think we’re put on earth to live for ourselves. I don’t live for myself. I don’t even own my own life. Other people own me. My family owns my life, my friends own my life, people I have yet to meet own my life. It’s not mine. It’s theirs. I think a person lives to touch others, to change lives, to be there for those who need them. Like George Eliot said, “What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?” So I don’t think I live my own life. I don’t think I want to live my own life. My life is not mine, it was never mine. It belongs to anyone who’s life is better now because I exist. It belongs to every stranger I’ve ever smiled at, and it belongs to those few people who will never be the same because of me. That’s why I have absolutely no problem with giving away pieces of myself-pieces of my soul. My soul was never mine, anyway. I told someone once in gym that I sold part of my soul earlier in the morning for free. I got the weirdest look. Like “either you’re joking, or you’re sick.” And I just laughed because…well, just cause I gave away a piece of paper (well, 2) that says “A piece of Amanda” doesn’t mean I’ve lost a part of myself and will now never be a whole and real person. Nothing of the sort! I gave away that part of myself a long time ago talking between bus seats in the rain thousands of miles from home…and boom, it was gone. Maybe I didn’t know it then, but it was. But as i said, it wasn’t mine, it didn’t ever belong to me, it was always someone else’s. I was just kind of holding it till I could give it away. From the day I was born, it wasn’t mine, I just didn’t know who it belonged to yet. Well, there were a lot of things I didn’t know about myself the day I was born. But I’m not getting into that. So I refuse to live my own life, for I do not live for myself. I mean, what am I? what will I be when I am gone? Once i die and am buried in the earth, people will not remember me as I was. Only I will ever know who and what I truly am. People will remember what I did for them, what I was to them…what part of myself is now a part of them. And is not that also what I am? Oh, the question of what I am… “Tell me who admires you and loves you, and I will tell you who you are.” said Charles Augustin Sanite-Beauve. Who am I then, but all I mean to others? And if that is what I am, then I think it is those others who own me. And if I do not own myself, then I cannot live my own life. I will live for the people I love…I will live to love them! And I will live not my own life, but a life I owe to them! And I will die not my own death, but the death of the person who was loved and who meant so much to all these other people. I will not die my own death in that it is not mine! It cannot be mine if my life is not mine. I don’t own my death as I don’t own my life. So screw the proverb, I will not live my own life, and I will not die my own death! A life doesn’t belong to the one who lives it. One is not made only of his own substance. He is made of all things he has ever seen, ever heard, ever felt, ever experienced. And I am not made of myself. I am made of all things I have ever lived. I am made, mostly, of other people. And if that is so, how can I say that I have my own life? I do not.
