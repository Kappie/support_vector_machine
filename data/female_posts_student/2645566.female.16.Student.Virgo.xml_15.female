Some would enjoy this, but not when you are *miserable*. And I didn't think it was really anything bad. Just a head cold and some nasty cough...but no. I have an ear infection in BOTH ears, some sort of throat infection with a technical name that I have never heard of, and bronchitis. Wowzers, let me tell you that it's a ton of fun! I guess the only good thing out of it is that I do *not* have mono. (hahahaha...now That was a funny conversation.)   Next week is a big week for me. On Wednesday, Paul and I will be together for 4 months. By far my longest relationship. AND! Then there's Valentine's Day on Saturday. That is going to be a new experiance for me. This is the first relationship that I have been in during any *big* holidays that you spend with the people that you love. I am really excited that I get to partake in that experiance this year. But of course, there is a downside to the upcoming week. I will be leaving town. So this is how I *hope* it will work out. By Wednesday I will be well again and will be able to spend time with Paul. Which will be a good thing because I leave Thursday afternoon. I will be gone Thursday evening, Friday (all day), and Saturday(most of the day). So that just means that Paul has to come to my concert on Saturday if he wants to see me on Valentines. If not, then we can always celebrate it on Sunday. Whichever he wants to do. I don't want to make him come to the concert if he really doesn't want to (even though I would be sad if he didn't come because it's Valentine's Day). I just want him to be happy because I love him.   Now for sooner times, I have a feeling that I need to spend more time with Chris. We usually have Monday nights and some time on Wednesdays. But I know that I haven't been putting as much effort into our friendship that I should. And in all honesty...I feel horrible about it. Chris and I have been friends since 7th grade. Yes we have had our ups and downs...but that is normal in teenage girl friendships. Yes, I have wanted to kill her at times and I know she has wanted to strangle me at some point or another...but I think that is what makes our friendship so unique and inspiring in ways. I'm sorry that I haven't put in full effort. I will make it up to you Chris.
