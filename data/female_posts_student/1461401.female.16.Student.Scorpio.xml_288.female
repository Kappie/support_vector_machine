In that, I realized I only have three friends. AND NONE OF THEM LIVE HERE ANYMORE!!!!!!!! god fucking dammit. People are such fucking hypocrits. "What a piece of work is man" The plays sucked too. Not to mention how many times I got stabbed in the back by some of my best "friends" and how many little cuts I now have on my arms from my fingernails. How the hell can you want something you don't know exists!? Where do out loyalties lie?! I want to scream louder than I can. I want to break and stab and stomp and crush and slash! But I won't. I will remain calm. (on the outside, anyway) I tried to be pretty. I tried to be perfect. I tried to do the right thing. Now I will go cry tonight, and tomorrow reconvince everyone that I am pretty, and perfect by doing the "right thing". I will do what everyone expects me to do, and lose all respect for myself in the process. G told us she's see us all at school tomorrow. I feel like it's more likely that she'll see me in the obituary.    i hate people. i hate them all so much.   yay states.
