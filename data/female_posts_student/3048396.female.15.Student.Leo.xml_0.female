I feel all weird inside. I feel like something bad is gonna happen. Ya know its just one of those feelings. I've been kinda down lately...and I don't have any idea why. I mean everythings great. My life is fine. Im getting good grades...summer is coming...and only 43 more days of school. I should feel fine. But...I don't. Theres something bugging me, and I don't know what. It just might be nerves...for this weekend. The small group contest on Saturday might be one. I have to play with 6 other people infront of a judge. Thats really not that bad. And then Sunday at 1:30 is my piano recital. That could be whats gettin to me...but who knows. I just feel like something bad is gonna happen soon. But hey. Im just weird....and everyone knows that already. Moving on...  Monday was an alright day. Nothing bad really happened...nothing good. Just an ordinary day. I really can't remember it...so yeah.  Yesterday was alright...except I felt like shit. But otherwise it was alright...Piano lessons went good for once. Julie said Im ready for this weekend...Im just not ready...on the inside. Nerves...*sigh* my hands have already been sweating...Eh Im such a worry wort. I wish I could just let some things go...but no I have to be dumb...and worry about every little thing posible. Oh well. I guess that makes me, me.  Today went pretty good. In Science the principal got on the intercom and said we were under a tornado warning...and I believed him at first...boy did my heart jump. But then he said it was only a drill but still. Eh if theres one thing that freaks me out...its tornados. Its always been a fear of mine. I remember when I was little n stuff and I'd wake up to my dad carring me down the basement steps and I'd freak out. I dunno...they just always freak me out. Yeah Im weird. I know. LoL. Band and Choir was pretty good today. Choir I got almost all my homework done so that made me happy and in band we hung out in the hall. It was amuzing. Greg is just so funny...and stupid! lol He told us that he tried all of the scented markers once and that the brown one actually tasted liked cinnimon. lol. He cracks me up. Then he told us that he did that just last year. Fun guy tho. LoL...but weird...so yeah. I went to the church and practiced the organ for about 40 mins tonight...and I'm doing pretty good on it...I just hope it goes good Sunday. So yeah I guess thats all thats been going on lately. I just wish I knew whats buggin me. I hope its nothing bad. I don't want anything bad to happen...anytime soon. Cuz of right now...my life is just great.  -Tara
