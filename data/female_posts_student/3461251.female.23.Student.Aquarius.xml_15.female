It's really silly if you think about it -- I'm going on 23 years old and I live alone.  But for some reason when my mom leaves town I can't sleep.  I've also come to realize -- she's like my 2nd pair of ears which means she looks out for me more then I'll ever realize.  I have a special mom.  I really do! It's about dang time I've realized that too because someday I'll have to leave her side and move in to the real world -- Not that I'm not in the real world now.  I mean like move further away from her, start my own life, have my own dreams... Hmm I have those now.  Ugh, I realize what I mean but I can't seem to put it words!! I give up but I do have a great mom and I'm very lucky for that!  Any ways, I do have some great news -- I recieved this yahoo IM tonight from a sweet  handsome old friend! I'm so happy to be talking to him again but gosh, I hope he doesn't disappear again if he does.... Hmm who knows?  LOL! I do, however, understand why he left.  So I'm guessing that's a good thing that we were able to get over that.
