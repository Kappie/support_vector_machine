Like all the other songs out there are about cheating (see confessions part 2 by Usher) but this one is different and thats why i like it. heres the next few lines:                                   "You've got a wife and a family And if I was you I wouldn't throw that away I'm not not the type of girl to Break up a happy home I really thought we could be friends But it seems that I gotta go"         soo hott.
