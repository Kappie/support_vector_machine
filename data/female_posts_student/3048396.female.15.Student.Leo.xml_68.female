Like Derk said my msn names are always gay...I said thanks and laughed cuz I've learned to let small things like that go by. It just cracks me up. Go on everyone. Yell at me. I'll just laugh at you. Anyways today has been good. Everythings doing great. Im happy and I feel wonderful. I tanned almost all afternoon...the sun feels wonderful. I love it. Its really great. Im really getting nice and dark. Maybe Kim and I will do something tonight cuz I wont get to do much with her tomorrow and I leave Sunday so yeah. Anyways....nothing else is really new. I probably will babysit tomorrow for my sweetie pie and then I'll make 8 bucks and clean the library and then probably finish packing. Im getting more and more excited by the minute! Im just not gonna let anything get to me and next week will go by smoothly. Can't wait! Anyways I'll shall part now. Later kids...
