He came home just a short while ago, and is sitting outside filing the edges of our new cupboard doors before installing them. My mother is chatting with him. Gavin is watching Blue's Clues.   I feel so bored. So inadequate. Of course, the movie I wanted to go watch is no longer in the theatre, and social conditioning prohibited me from eating the whole container of Ben and Jerry's.  I never had PMS before I had a baby. Sheesh, this is ridiculous. What is this, day 3?  On the bright side, Sal called today, confused my mother ("Who's Charles?"), and spoke with Mike for a full 30 seconds before hanging up and promising to call back. Naturally, I ducked under the couch when the phone rang, because I have an irrational fear of phones, and the suspense is killing me. Will he ever call back?
