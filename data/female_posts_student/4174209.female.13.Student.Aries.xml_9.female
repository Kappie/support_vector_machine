This is it's new and improved version - so if you've already heard this poem, i suggest you read it again because I changed it.      -Sharpie         My Song          Blinded by Imaginary Light, Forged from A child’s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate, Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong? This is my song  Surrounded by A substance of Shadows, Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song  Forced to trust A wisdom’s enigma, Destiny’s drama, An hypocrite’s dogma, The delightfulness of trauma. A lie told and retold Till it was almost the truth, From Shadow’s Solidity Comes a world of fake Radiance, Nothing is left Of Moral’s honorable fight, Truth’s flawless face Is now a scarred blight, Worsened by resisting That Imaginary Light, And all along From Right to Wrong This is my song  What has our world become? Love is weak Hate is strong Who can resist? Who can hold out for long? Is this a song?  And whether I will ever realize the truth Or live lies Or even belong This is my song    Copyright in 2004 by Stephanie *********
