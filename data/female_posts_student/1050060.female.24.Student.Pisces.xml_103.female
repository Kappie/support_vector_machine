I talked to Amanda about it and I talked to my parents. So anyways I will learn more about this once I get the information that I need. But wish me luck and pray that everything will be ok.   I have today, tomorrow and the next day of school left. So I will be done on Wednesday. I will be going home for a week then I will be back for exams. Anyways I have to get to class. Have a good day!
