See, my parents are divorced, and I rarely visit my dad's house because my step mom lives there, and, well, I don't like her much. But I'm sure by now everyone knows that. Well, I'm hungry, and there's a plate full of hot dogs waiting upstairs for me, but why am I not up there choking them down? Because there are two people up there that I have know idea who they are. And I'm not about to go shove grub in my face with two strangers staring at me. Leave people, leave!  Alice, Rob, and Emma are gone right now because they went to go visit Grandma and Grandpa somewhere south of McChef*. I didn't even know they were in Nebraska. Dad says they've been here a month already. I think they are probably outcasting us as well since they aren't liking my dad much at the moment.  I miss SQ* already!
