I just need someone to turn to and tell me everything will be okay. But in my world, that's too much to ask for. Way too much. I mean, certain people are becoming so cocky, to the point when they don't even ask me how I am, or anything in a conversation. That has messed with my emotions so much. Yeah, I'll stop whining now. So I was thinking, the love I had for one person is slowly deteriorating from me, which is a good thing because I can't look at that person in that way. So, yea. Today was interesting. Great Adventure trip, I didn't go on it. Yep. Staff meeting was I guess the highlight. However, thr highlight of the staff meeting was not my powerband-ness, but Stringer coming up to me and handing me a pair of glasses, which were run over by a car. It was "abstract art". Oh, and Chris decided instead of having the "Ultimate Grunge Party" on 90's day, we are having a "Spice World Party" Haha, awesome. I'm going to wear one of my many Spice Girls shirts. So yea, my mom came, we drove Larisa home, we got home, and ate pizza bagels. And here I am now. Okay, that's about it! Buh-bye!
