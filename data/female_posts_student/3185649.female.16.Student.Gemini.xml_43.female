But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit. But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant.  And when he was living as a man, he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God, even when that caused his death-death on a cross. So God raised him to the highest place. God made his name greater than every other name so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus-everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father."  Philippians 2:5-11 (NCV)
