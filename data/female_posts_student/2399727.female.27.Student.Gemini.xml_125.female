Did a grocery run and a food-for-pastor run for Thursday.  Special cookies and carrot cake (mmm).    Wrote up a proposal for a very likely fictional job today.  If nothing else, I'm creative and have a good imagination!  I'll see if anything comes of it after Thursday.    Been waiting all day to find out if I got a spot in Psychology or not.  The grad secretary hasn't gotten back to me...  Got a pic from p.p. (clothed). :-)  More to come ...
