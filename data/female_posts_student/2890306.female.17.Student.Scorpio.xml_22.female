Instead, my current task for this period is to finish AP Chemistry homework.  If only the mighty Noteboom allowed us a month and a half to do  that .  Sheesh.  Wishful thinking, I suppose.  In some randomly exciting news, Geoffrey and I were nominated for a Drammy!  "Cutest couple"...who ever doubted it?  Not me, not me ;)  Nicholas told me today during choir.  I guess they have been racking up nominees for a while.  How fun it will be to attend!  I am so glad I'm in drama.  They always think of fun events to put on.  Well, I best be back to "working."  Until later, little ones :)
