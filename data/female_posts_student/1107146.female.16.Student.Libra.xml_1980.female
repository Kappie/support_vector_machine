Meaning the blog is back in action and this is the official announcement as to my addiction to the internet.  I've been home approximately ten minutes.  Translated: long enough to put my suitcases in my room.    But I'm hungry, probably shouldn't be, we ate SO MUCH!!!  (Including Josh!!!)  so I'll go have a nice rabbit food now.  Lettuce, not the pellets.  Ok, yeah, I need sleep, and someone give me the answers to those stupid Beloved symbolism quotes.  *Sigh*  Still so much to do, and tomorrow is MONDAY.  Stupid mondays.  Stupid Ms. Calhoun.  Stupid Beloved.    So much for the euphoric Biltmore feeling.
