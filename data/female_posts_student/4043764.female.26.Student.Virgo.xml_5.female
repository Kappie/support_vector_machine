Anyway, as she began to cheer up - basically, I just got her talking about politics and C-Span - she told me that  urlLink Charlie Rangel  came into her store. This is sort of interesting because her store is in South Carolina. Anyway, my brother and sister-in-law often help mom out by taking over the reins during the weekend and evenings. My brother was there at the time (he's the best celebrity spotter out there). Charlie Rangel comes in and is like, "How are you doing, young man?" [this whole young-looking thing runs in our family; my brother is 35, which is certainly younger than Rangel, but not all  that  young...] My brother  responds: "Doing fine, Mr. Rangel, sir..."
