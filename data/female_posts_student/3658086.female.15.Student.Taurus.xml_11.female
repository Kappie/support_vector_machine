Having discovered blogs yesterday, I found that Jenni was right (as normal)a blog is a really good way to sort your life out so to speak. I am having quite a good day today... maths with megahey, exhilerating as always!! Anyway....... I've been quite happy this week due to getting back with Luce!!! Got some pictures through of her yesterday aswell, so if I've got a permanent smile on my face thats why!! On the bad side tho I have fallen out with henry pretty much for good, which really got me down. I take it out on myself... shouldnt do that. Need to stop with the whole self harm thing. Anyway.. I'm really worried about Deya... come and talk to me any time mate... noone will be told (except maybe muriel..!!!) Ahhhh counselling today.... I'm really worried about it.. I dont like it!! grrr...4words ginger scottish fat muriel! Another thing I've had on my mind but never really talked to anyone about (except Katie the gappy... legend!) is my faith in god.... sounds silly i kno.. but over the past however long, I have been doubting god... my theory; I am a Christian, yet there are people that aren't, and they get easy lives... doesnt really seem fair... so I kinda thought well maybe there isnt a god.. but having been a christian all my life (too many lessons with stevo soz!) I never really tried to admit this to my mum or my sister coz they would have gone mad!! but I kinda think I do believe in god, kind of because I'm scared not to (devil and all that)... and after long chats with katie, I have decided that I do believe and started praying etc again... any thoughts on that??? better go anyway, I meant to be practicing!! laterz
