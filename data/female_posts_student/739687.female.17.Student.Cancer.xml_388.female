I mean, Less Than Jake let me and two other people in without a problem, or an ID check, let us talk to the band for a while, chill before the show...you know. But hey. It was still cool.  Today I got my belly button pierced. Fun stuff.  Oh, and I went out to eat with my dad and our waiter was really hot, and right before we left he looked over and winked at me. Oh sexy beast.  I swear, I've developed this 'guy' mentality when it comes to...sex. Or just sexuality for that matter. Gender roles. It's like that "I'd do him...and him...and him...oh he's hot, I'd probably do him too" attitude.  Whatever, I'm stupid.  LoL, make me shut up.  I know you all want to. Tough shit though, huh?  Aaaaannnnddd....forgot what else I had to say.  Oh yes, I remember.  People are so bitch-bitch-bitchy. :)  Not people I hang out with...we're cool.  I'm glad I don't know alot of bitch-bitch-bitchy people. I'd have to find a loaded gun.  ....and gun laws are a bitch these days.  Bang bang crazies.
