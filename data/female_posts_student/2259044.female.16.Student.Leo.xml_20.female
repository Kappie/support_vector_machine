(well, people don't usually compliment u on those days but ya) u know wut i mean? it's like u never can tell wut u come across as, i never know how i sound to others, sometimes i feel bad, cuz people take me the wrong way, other times it worx in my favor (not often) sometimes the way i say something, sounds like im mad, and people get offended, and sometimes i look like somethings wrong, and nothing is. other times i appear happy and im not. im not saying people r bad at reading me, i think i'm bad at conveying my feelings correctly, the way i do things just doesn't match up. i dunno, if i knew, then i wouldn't spend all this time typing this out...obviously! anyhow, catch ya later, changedfish
