It seems like years ago that Suzie picked me up at the airport, but then, I can't believe that I am already at home and it's over.  God did a lot on that trip. I learned a lot about myself, how God works (or doesn't) and boys. Which I know is weird to learn about on a mission trip, but I really needed to.   It feels good to be home. I just can't believe it's over. I can't believe that I won't go to the church tonight and hear Kenneth say something about his nipples (how did that start again?) and the leaders won't stare at us becuse they don't know he meant dimples. It's so weird to think that I won't see Brian again, and I won't drive with that maniac for another year, and hello? I can't believe the tping with Mary Jo is over. I can't imagine not going to the church tonight, I can't imagine not seeing Connor tell Jose what he's doing wrong with the mime tonight.  I just can't believe it's over. What do I do now?
