All sounds fine and good apart from the person I'm going with, an ex-boyfriend. Yep, 5 weeks with an ex is taking the 'lets be friends' business to a whole new level I think. I have that un-settling feeling that it could well turn into 5 weeks of exchanging thinly veiled insults and long silences. We are simply too different to get along in such close proximity as our friendship is normally buffered by not seeing each other for several weeks at a stretch.   And not to mention my patience. This morning the phone rang... I picked it up, "So you do answer phones in your house then?" was the first thing I heard. Maybe it was the sickeningly sarcastic tone, or he just caught me at a bad moment, but pure irritation rose its ugly head, and how I bit down a nasty reply I don't know. I was feeling exactly the same emotion as I did in the dying days of our relationship.   It's funny isn't it, I don't exactly remember the date we broke up, or what exactly was said. I just remember the irritation I felt at his behavior over the previous few weeks. It was that same irritation that made me feel so ridiculously relieved and even happy when we split up. He was no longer my concern, his personality was no longer going to grate against mine, and no longer try my patience.   I must have been out of my mind when I agreed to go on my elective with him.  Oh well, it's too late now to go back.  On the brighter side, my preparations are coming together nicely. Travel insurance is sorted. Currency exchanged. Rucksac waiting to be packed. Walking boots are nearly broken in.  A few more things need to be brought... Just insect repellent, shorts and shoes I think.
