Seriously though, she isn't. Hmm... Yo vomit. That's what we learnt in Spanish! Neat huh? Now if you're ever puking in Spain you know how to say I vomit! Woohoo! There's a whole list... he vomits, they vomit, we vomit. We vomit? When would you ever want to, or need to say that? Ahh well, that's foreign language learning for you. Full of weird stuff. Like French. I mean, like we're gonna go to France and talk to people about 'Our Ideal Town' geez, that's just plain madness! Ahh, I have chocolate and tv waiting for me downstairs, and blogging with no one to blog to and no one else blogging gets boring after a time. Ahh well... I keep doing it any way! (Like breathing, try giving that nasty habit a break) Scab! Bubi!
