Stayed up all night with my boy again.  He's only like a year and change younger than me, but it feels like more.  But I wouldn't call him "my boy" to his face.  I'm really sweet on him, so much that it slays me to look at him.  Slays in a good way. (?)  We half assed watched The Big Lebowski for the nth time, then we got a little cozy and missed most of it.   I really relate to The Dude, though.  If I were a guy, I would be just like that.  He's my alter ego or something.  I won some writing award in a contest I forgot I entered.  I get a cash prize!  Now I can pay off all my god damned parking tickets!  It feels so good to get affirmation like that.  Maybe I'm a fool, but sometimes I really think I am going to make it.  And usually I'm so jaded all the time.  But for now I'm riding this wave of optimism, and it's only a couple of weeks till I go to the ceremony and get the check.  It's for $250.  Nice.  So tired!  Did I mention that?  I had to write a paper this morning before class.  In my estimation, it will probably get a B, but it was total crap.  It was over St. Thomas Aquinas, which was so treacherously boring to read that I wanted to chuck it into the john.  And then the paper!!  I kept seeing rainbows in front of my eyes while I was writing it.  Like looking through a prism.     I'm not making sense at all.  At least I cleared off these last few minutes...
