So, I responded!  Even though I need sleep this is so much more fun!  Anyways, PoA was freaking awesome!  The acting is 100% better, all the characters have grown up, and Cuaron did a great job as the new director!  Let's just saw that Rupert Grint is...  wow -- so cute!   the Weasley twins, Fred  George, I'm married to them.  Ellen is married to Hoobastank, Cassie is married to Trapt,  I am married to the Phelps twins.  Talk about adorable.  I don't know what is wrong with me, but I am *so* attracted to guys with red hair (that would explain my Brian problem).  And Tom Felton, who I didn't think was that cute before, has matured tremendously!  He is made to be like a bit of a pussy in this movie which ticked me off, but also he is really mean!  I can't believe that Tom hasn't read the HP books!  I thought that was kind of stupid.  He said that he didn't want to because he thought it was going to influence his acting, and he wanted to play the Draco in the script, not the written one...  Umm hello?  This is based on a book!  Cuaron did a freaking awesome job!  All of the scenery is great, Hedwig looked better  hung around more, and the Whomping Willow was really funny.  Though the plot got a bit butchered, I am very very very pleased overall!!
