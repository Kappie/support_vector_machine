       
      ok. my folks r gone, so now i can finally relax lol. lets c, where should i begin? well im starting 2 think jim is just as immature as my aunt and uncle say he is. the only responsibility they left him the whole time we were gone was 2 get the mail since they hired an agency 2 take care of the pets. good thing 2, cuz he couldnt handle just getting the mail ONCE the whole time we were gone! plus the house is a mess, and there's 5-day old pizza on the counter, along with a bunch of other once-edible food substances i cant identify. and of course he ran off 2 his gf's house when he started gettin yelled at. so who's stuck cleaning everything? me, of course! u know, i hate 2 say it, and mayb im wrong, but i think in some ways we'll all b a lot happier once he's out of the house... im goin 2 a concert 2morrow w/ tiffany 4 her 16th b-day. i almost didnt get 2 go, cuz i 4got 2 request that day off work, and i didnt realize it till i called from the airport 2day 2 check my schedule and they said i had 2 work 2morrow. i was ready 2 just call tiffany and tell her i couldnt go cuz walton has already been so nice about coverin 4 me when i needed it, i just couldnt ask him 2 do it again. bsides, i thought it would b almost the most irresponsible thing i could do (aside from 4getting 2 put in 4 the time i mean). but after my aunt's lecture, she suggested i call them and tell them that we're stayin in st. louis 4 another day and ask them 2 find some1 2 cover 4 me. so thats wut i did. so i got the "im very disappointed in u" speech from my aunt and the "im not very happy about this" speech from my boss, but at least im goin. now if i can only get rid of the guilt. im thinking mayb i should have decided 2 just go 2 work. the last thing i need is 2 appear even more irresponsible than im sure they already think i am. and i mean, i deserve it neway 4 4getting 2 put in 4 the time. it only seems fair that i work 2morrow. but no, i had 2 find a way 2 weazle out of it instead of just accepting the consequences... but its 2 late now. so now, about my trip 2 st. louis. im gonna record almost every detail of it, mostly 4 my own reference, cuz it was the most awesome experience ever, and i dont wanna 4get a thing. so this will b a bit long lol. it may get sentimental and philosophical at times, but its all stuff that needs 2 b said.  july 24: i got up at 4 in the morning and left 4 the airport at 5. jim came w/ us so he could drive the van back. and he even gave me a hug b4 he left. i was quite surprised lol. i cant remember the last time he hugged me. the flight was awesome cuz i slept almost the whole way. it was really uncomfy, but i slept lol. so that was a fun flight. but the best part was the view. it was just one continuous layer of white fluffy clouds and it looked like we were riding on them. it was easy 2 imagine that i could just get out and walk on top of them, and they seemed 2 stretch 2 the end of the world. so after we landed we took the shuttle 2 the rental car place, where we met up w/ my grandparents who had gotten there thursday. only 2 find out they didnt have a van 4 us, even tho my aunt reserved one 2 months ago. so she was mad! but of course i had 2 miss all the action cuz they made me stay outside w/ the luggage. but my pepere came out and told me it was gonna b a while so i made myself a nice little bed on the bags and slept some more. well it was finally settled that the rental car place was gonna shuttle us 2 another rental car place. so we did that, got r car, and all was well. but then we got 2 the hotel and r room wasnt ready yet. so we went and took a tour of the budweiser brewery while we were waiting. that was cool even tho beer isnt really my thing lol. but i finally got a new bathing suit (yes, a budweiser one!) my uncle said i couldnt get it cuz then he would b 2 attracted 2 me (eeeeew, incest! lol). and i also got a pin (cuz i have 2 get one from every place i go!) well by the time we came back r room was ready. it was soooooo fancy! i kept feelin like i didnt belong there. so after we got settled me, abi, and memere and pepere went swimming (me in my new bud suit lol). but the lifeguard kept lookin at me and i think he was checkin me out, so i didnt stay long lol. so i hung out in the room 4 a little while, and went 2 bed extremely early cuz i was exhausted lol. but i watched tv 4 a while and fell asleep around 10.  july 25: boring day. all i did was help my aunt set up 4 registration all day, then i helped w/ the kid's registration when it started at 5. but they didnt really need me, so i went out 2 dinner w/ my uncle and abi and timmy and stephanie. jess flew in that afternoon, and we went running in the fitness room later that night. but i only ran 2 miles cuz it was right after dinner and i wasnt planning on running lol.  july 26: this was the first day of the conference, and i helped in the daycare most of the day. but there werent many kids cuz there werent really ne meetings or nething that the kids couldnt go 2. and there were 6 ppl there from the agency my aunt had hired so the ratio of caregivers 2 kids was like 3:1 lol. so i was pretty bored. so after lunch memere and pepere took me and abi out since i really wasnt needed, and we went down 2 the arch and the riverfront. that arch is pretty big lol. but the wait was 2 long 2 go up in it, so we went on a boat ride down the mississippi instead. that was ok but kind of boring. lol i think i have ADD. i tried 2 watch the sights, but i just rested my eyes most of the time. the only thing i found interesting was the arch. we had 2 walk back 2 the hotel cuz memere didnt wanna wait 4 the shuttle. lol so that was a nice long walk. but something every1 should experience at least once: getting lost in downtown st. louis lol. haha but pepere bought me a shirley temple when we got back. good times lol. then i went running in the fitness room (by myself this time, cuz jess had already gone running). but i only ran 3 miles cuz i cant stand running on tread mills. i get so bored. haha must b my ADD again!  july 27: there were a few more kids in the daycare, but still not many. except when the zoo came, all the parents brought their kids in and stayed w/ them, but left right after the zoo left. and thats when me and abi left 2. memere and pepere took us 2 union station and we walked around 4 a little while. when we got back, i went back 2 the daycare room, and i dont know where abi went. but the only kid there was alex. i remembered him from the last conference 2 years ago when he was 3. he has a more severe case of joubert syndrome and he's also blind. at the last conference i layed down on the floor w/ him and rubbed his back 4 like 3 hours and just wondered why... i did the same thing this time. he was 2 years older, and taller, but other than that he was exactly the same. with his thin arms and legs that seemed 2 have no muscles in them, just laying there on the floor rocking himself back and forth, sometimes grunting, just trying 2 find a way 2 cope w/ his darkness. and it occured 2 me as i layed (lied?) there that this was all he would ever b. so 2day i just layed there staring in 2 his empty hazel eyes moving back and forth but never seeing. and i wondered wut he saw there deep inside his own darkness. then he smiled. it was fleeting, and it did nothing 2 light up his dark eyes, but it provided a glimpse in2 his world. but of course he wasnt smiling at nething in this world. then it was gone. and i started thinking. if there is a god, he cant b as merciful as evry1 says he is, or if he is, not as perfect. he either knowingly condemned alex--all those kids--2 darkness and ignorance, or he made a mistake. either way, its impossible 4 me 2 trust in this god. i dont know whether 2 hate him 4 wut he did 2 alex, or 2 pity him 4 having 2 live up 2 all those divine expectations ppl have of him that he can never live up 2. but y am i talkin about god? didnt i stop having nething 2 do w/ him a long time ago? u know, at first i didnt remember alex. but when i saw him and they told me his name it all came back 2 me, and i remembered 2 years ago laying w/ him and i had promised 2 always remember that moment bcuz it was important. then i recalled various other situations and events that i told myself i always wanted 2 remember but have now started slipping away. it kind of depresses me and makes me feel like theres no use in experiencing nething bcuz it just gets lost over the years. thats y im writing evrything down... after i layed down w/ alex i played w/ shanna, who's about 11 and not affected as severely as alex. she cant talk, but she knows how 2 get her point across. and she's so smart. ne1 lookin at her, or ne of these kids, wouldnt think they know nearly as much as they do. like, she knows sign language, but she heard us talking amongst rselves and say we dont know sign language, so she didnt use it w/ us. she just used movements and gestures she knew we could understand. all these kids r so much smarter than ne1 gives them credit 4.  july 28: instead of goin 2 daycare right away, i stayed in the meeting room after breakfast 2 watch a presentation they were doin about genetics, and how the joubert genes r passed down, and their progress in finding the genes that cause the syndrome. it was all really interesting and i actually understood most of it lol. the next part was prenatal diagnosis. i watched a little bit of that but abi wanted me 2 go 2 daycare w/ her. but thats ok. i kinda started 2 lose interest there neway. so i took abi 2 the daycare and we watched some african storytelling thing the zoo was putting on. then abi went w/ my uncle 2 pick up lunch, so i was finally free lol. 4 a little while neway. so while they were gone, jess made me keep her company while she travelled around the whole hotel in search of a single stamp lol. haha she likes dragging me around on her little errands. but its cool, i like hanging out w/ her. haha on the elevator she told me about her mad crush on one of my aunt's researchers, named Ellis. then, after we finally got a stamp we went back 2 jess's room so she could decide wut she was gonna wear that night. then we went back 2 my room and had lunch. then i had 2 go set up the arts and crafts 4 the kids. that was really unorganized cuz there were only a couple kids, and evry1 just kinda did wut they wanted. but i had fun helping them. its interesting 2 c all the different skill levels of the kids. so after that i hung out and played w/ them 4 a while b4 going 2 change 4 dinner. i was lookin 4ward 2 the ceremony afterward cuz there was a teen/adult panel where the teens and adults w/ joubert syndrome get up and talk about wut their life is like. then after that was the bereavement ceremony 4 all the kids w/ joubert syndrome who have died. but after dinner erin's mom asked me if i would babysit cuz erin wanted 2 go 2 bed. i wasnt 2 happy about it but i went. my uncle was taping the whole thing neway. so when i got up 2 the room erin was already asleep so all i did was watch tv all evening. when her mom came back she tried 2 pay me but i wouldnt take the money. i wasnt 2 happy about missing the ceremony but she had seemed desperate 4 a babysitter and i was glad 2 help her out.  july 29: i hung out in the daycare all morning, and sat w/ alex 2 watch the presentation the aquarium was putting on. i helped him touch all the animals  as the lady brought them around. he really liked the snake. he wouldnt stop rubbing his hand over it, and kept reaching 4 it after she moved on w/ it. after the aquarium left i went 4 a run. i took abi w/ me cuz she was bored and she had become my shadow. even tho kids rnt supposed 2 b in the fitness room, but o well. she ran on the tread mill a little, but never really broke a sweat cuz she duznt understand the meaning of exercise lol. but even tho i had her, i still managed 2 get in a decent run, cuz she was pretty patient. so i ran 5 miles at a pretty fast pace. haha, getting better w/ the tread mill. but that was only cuz i picked the right one, and i got a view of the arch lol. then we stayed at the daycare till it was time 2 change 4 dinner. there were no ceremonies or nething after dinner, so i went swimming w/ memere while abi swam w/ her friend. after that i had 2 babysit jimmy and jacob, who r 12 and 13. just like w/ all the other kids, i was amazed at how smart they r. especially jimmy. they cant really talk, and they have 2 scoot around on their butts cuz they cant walk. jimmy has an x-box, and is really good at it. lol he kept beating me at star wars and i was actually trying! i asked him 2 show me how 2 play and he pointed 2 the buttons and did hand gestures 2 show me wut all the buttons did. but jacob isnt really at the same level as jimmy mentally, so he couldnt play. he was just watchin tv while we played. but i kept lookin over at him and i could c he was becoming really agitated 4 some reason. then he just started screaming and crying. i had no idea wut was wrong or wut i should do. i picked him up and brought him in2 the bedroom and put him on the bed thinking mayb a change of scenary would help. it didnt. so i brought him back in2 the other room and put him on the floor and just tried 2 calm him down. i layed him in the middle of the floor away from everything so he wouldnt hurt himself. but he had already opened up an old scab in his forehead. and he kept biting his hand and actually drew blood. but i guess i put him 2 close 2 jimmy cuz jacob reached up and pulled his hair. so yea, i had 2 12 and 13-yearold boys, both screaming, and me not knowing wut 2 do. but jimmy was a lot easier 2 console than jacob. so after i calmed him down, i went back 2 jacob. he had been screaming 4 almost a half hour, and it was 11:00 at night. so i called their parents and told them wut was going on. they said they were on they're way back but were stuck in traffic and would b there as soon as possible. well i eventually calmed him down b4 they got back by reading him a story. should have thought of it sooner lol. so their parents came back, paid me (i figured i had earned it this time lol), then i left.  july 30: this was the last day of the conference. i was in the daycare most of the day. a magician came 4 the kids that afternoon, and there was an ice cream social and stuff. but the best part was the closing ceremony that night. along w/ dinner, there was a silent auction. i bidded on a skateboard and a pack of 4 2-sided beatles puzzles. lol im not really in 2 the beatles, but hey, they were puzzles. and bsides, i never tried a 2-sided one b4. but i didnt win it neway. thats only cuz i had 2 leave early 2 put erin 2 bed and sit w/ her again. i asked memere 2 keep an eye on it 4 me, but she didnt do a very good job lol. i won the skateboard tho. but this time i REALLY wasnt happy about bing asked 2 babysit. i thought it was really inconsiderate 2 ask me 2 miss the closing ceremony like that. but the part of it that i didnt miss was fun. my aunt gave a big long closing speech, most of which she cried thru lol. and the family of one of the kids who had died was there, and they put out their album that they had made of her. her name was analee and she was only 4 years old. i remember my aunt goin 2 the funeral and the pictures she had brought back w/ her and how i had cried when my aunt told me all those stories about her. i almost cried again as i stood there looking at that album. all the pictures of her, the poem her parents had wrote, and various stories her brothers had written about her, written with a child's understanding and acceptance, and radiating simplicity. i would have cried if i wasnt around all those ppl. i guess its a good thing i didnt go 2 the bereavement ceremony, cuz i would have balled like a baby! there rnt many things that really make me cry, but i just cant handle death.  july 31: this was the first real day of my "vacation". i slept till 9, and by the time i got up my grandparents were just finishing loading up their truck, and they left around 10. they were driving back 2 maryland 2 drop off some stuff from the conference, then driving back 2 massachusetts. bill and mary jane had come in thursday, and they came over along w/ one of my aunt's board members erik, and they just sat down and talked 4 a while. then we left w/ bill and mary jane and went 2 grant's farm. that is, after we spent like an hour saying goodbye 2 every1 from the conference. grant's farm was ok. but we didnt get 2 stay long cuz both abi and stephanie started throwing fits. so my aunt was mad 4 like the rest of the day, and if i tried 2 talk, even if i was talkin 2 bill, i'd get yelled at. so i just decided 2 stop talking. it was like 4:30 by the time we got back 2 the hotel, and i watched tv 4 a little while, then went running. i was planning on doin 6 miles, but i only did 5 cuz of time and cuz i got bored lol. then my aunt and uncle went out w/ bill and mary jane and i had 2 watch the kids. after dinner we went swimming, and i even managed 2 get stephanie in the pool (shes autistic and never wants 2 do nething). so that cleared me of ne wrong i may have previously done that day in my aunt's eyes.  august 1: we went 2 nascar speedpark, which is like a go-cart and arcade place. bill and mary jane came w/ us. it was so fun! bill kept tryin 2 run me off the track when we were riding the go-carts. lol i got him back tho. but not on purpose. c, he was comin up next 2 me on the corner and the kind of car i had wasnt very good at takin sharp turns lol. then timmy's hat flew off and every1 was runnin over it lol. so yea that was fun. they also had a climbing wall, but they wouldnt let me do it cuz i wasnt wearing sneakers. stupid ppl lol. abi wanted 2 do it, but she chickened out while they were puttin the harness on. after we left, we went out 2 dinner at the spaghetti factory. the best food i've ever had! when we got back 2 the hotel we ordered "mean girls" from the hotel and watched it. it was ok but i didnt think it was very original. then i watched "malibu's most wanted" on HBO after evry1 went 2 sleep. funniest movie ever!!  august 2: we finally went 2 the arch, the only thing i'd been lookin 4ward 2 the whole trip lol!. we went early in the morning 2 beat the crowd, so there was no wait. it was so much fun! abi and stephanie even went up. i thought i was gonna get claustrophobic in those little capsules but i didnt. we had 2 get in these little capsules that seat 5 ppl and it brought us all the way 2 the top, then we got out and looked out the windows. its 630 feet high! it was so fun. its like a triangle so the windows on the wall r tilted and u can lean over so its almost like ur lying down and look down. it felt kind of like doin the skycoaster at 6 flags, only much higher lol. and i started 2 realize how scary it might b 2 actually go skydiving. but its still somethin i definitely wanna do. it was so much fun! we saw r hotel, the baseball stadium, the football stadium, and even a person doin sit-ups on the grass under us lol. after we came down we went in the museum, then the gift shop, where i finally got my puzzle lol. i plan 2 start it as soon as im done the one im workin on now. but this one is only 500 pieces, not quite as frustrating lol. then we went 2 union station. we walked around 4 a little while and had lunch at hooters. then we went 2 the city museum, which really isnt a museum at all lol. its like a big playground. a HUGE playgraound! its like 4 stories high, inside and outside. the outside is all like construction equipment and metal an wires 4 the kids 2 climb on, and its so high up! there was also a huge ball pit that was full of those big inflatable balls instead of the little plastic ones. my uncle even took stephanie in there. but we almost couldnt get her out lol.then the inside is like all trees and caves and stuff 2 climb in. and they also had an art room, a restaurant, and a train ride 4 the little kids. haha i had so much fun! lol i was getting in touch w/ my inner child. man, i wish i could have done somethin like that when i was little. haha but thats ok, cuz i still got 2 do it. i might have made a fool of myself, but i did it lol. but not really, cuz i only look like im like 12 so its all good lol. then we went out 4 dinner, then went back 2 the hotel and went swimming 4 a little while. after that we ordered "home on the range" and watched that. i didnt really like the movie itself, but the soundtrack was great! (lol tim mcgraw).  august 3: and 2day wasnt 2 exciting. we slept in, packed up, then drove 2 the airport. r flight left at 1:30, and we landed at 3:30, which was really 4:30 since we had lost an hour somewhere over the course of the flight (im still confused about that! lol). then we came home and unpacked. then i hugged my computer! lol not really but i was glad 2 c it again. i talked 2 irina 4 a little while while i was waitin 4 my folks 2 leave lol. well they finally left, and now im just sitting here talkin 2 irina agian (even tho there's some1 i'd much rather b talkin 2) and wondering how in the world it could possibly b 11:30 at night. i guess this time change is really getting 2 me lol. wait a minute, i started writing this thing at 7:30. wow, yea i definitely have no life lol. but im done now. and tony still isnt on. i was hopin 2 kill some time. lol i guess i managed 2 do that, but obviously not enuff. mayb ill go get some dinner (the best part of bing home alone: eating dinner at 11 pm :-) but i just realized that they left me no food lol. again! at least they left toilet paper this time, but the only thing in the fridge is the chocolate milk and philly cheese steaks my bro bought while we were gone. hmm think that will last 5 days? lol. but i know as soon as i leave tony's gonna come on cuz thats just my luck. haha o well.
