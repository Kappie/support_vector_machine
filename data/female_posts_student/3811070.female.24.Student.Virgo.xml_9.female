I'll take the humidity of the South over this freaking oven anyday.   Anyway. The baby has been jumping up and down today like he's doing floor exercises in my belly. I wish he would stop, but on the other hand I really enjoy feeling him move. I'm so paranoid anyway that I freak out when I don't feel him.  This morning I woke up to him doing something weird though and it's really got me feeling scared that I did something bad like sleep on my belly or something. It felt like he was... I don't know. I can't decribe it other than it felt like he was struggling in there, or something. Like he was trying to fight something. That's the only way I can describe it. And I don't know if I'm being paranoid and it's nothing to worry about or it  is  something to worry about and I'm not going to the hospital because I think I'm psyching myself out and it's really nothing.  Luckily I have a doctor appointment tomorrow so I can ask her then.   I freak out about this baby coming out okay because my sister was sick for a long time and she died recently. Is this normal, I ask myself, to be so insanely paranoid about death and dying that it's always on my mind?  I worry about Hubby riding the bike to work because someone could kill him, especially these stupid California drivers. He's already laid it down once, going 30 on an on-ramp and I saw how cut up he was and how stiff and in pain he was after that.  I worry about him riding in the helicopters at work. He told me yesterday they flew out to Tahoe and when he was checking out the bird before they came back there was oil or hydraulic fluid all over the place and they flew back anyway cause he didn't want to stay in Tahoe overnight. Why would you tell me this, Brian, when you know how insane I am?  I wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats because I dream about the baby dying of SIDS. Or that he comes out deformed, or that he comes out with some horrible problem or otherwise not a normal healthy baby. It's scary, and I don't want to wait the however many weeks I have left in this pregnancy to find out. The doctor won't give me another Ultrasound cause they're supposedly unhealthy for the baby... but I'm so freaked out that I'm actually thinking about just going to the hospital with some made-up pregnancy problem just to see him on the Ultrasound screen again, and make sure he's okay. And how fucking stupid is that? Not to mention a waste of everyone's time.  Funny, that's the same kind of shit my sister used to pull. I don't dispute that she was very sick, but it seems like she used to invent shit that was wrong with her because the attention had shifted from her for a few minutes and she didn't like that. She was 34 years old and acted like a kid. I got to the point where I just got exasperated with all of her ailments and then when she died... I remember talking to the doctor at the Emergency Room, pretty much telling him in not so many words that I thought what my mom was telling me was full of shit and what was his take on the matter?  And then they took her off the respirator and she died not hours later. And I felt so horrible. And I wasn't there. I didn't want to go, even, when my mom told me that she was in the hospital again I remember my exact thoughts were "Oh, hell. Again? What's she dying of  this  time?" and I decided not to go home because I had been summoned to the hospital for her "last days" so many times before. I thought that this was another of those times... even though Mom said she was on a repirator in a coma.  In ICU for fuck's sake.  Brian says that I couldn't have done anything to help her, and that blaming myself for her death is the same as blaming myself for the Black Friday stock market crash. But I still feel horrible that I didn't go and be with her when she died.  But thinking about it, would I have been able to handle it, watching her die? I don't know. It's still way to hard to think about even now, 7 months later.  I couldn't even go to her casket at the funeral because I just couldn't bring myself to look at her. I did finally go and tell her goodbye, though.  She looked so different, but there she was. My sister, older than me by 10 years and already dead.  God, it's so hard. I thought writing would purge some of the sadness, like lancing an infected wound or something. I guess there's still some left in there.  Maybe I'll never get over it and will always break down into tears when I think about her.  I don't want to cry when I think about Missy. I want to be able to remember her and the good things we did and the good times we had, but my brain inevitably turns to the day of her funeral and there go the waterworks again.  Shit. I hate to cry.   -Moi
