I shouldn't even care Im starting to grow stronger I can last a little longer Im not afraid of tomorrow Or scared of death Watching your holy fire Taking my last breath I cant run any faster Running out of gas Under so much pressure Everyone, waiting for me to crash Life is just a complication One big humiliation Im waiting for tomorrow For my bodies death Waiting for the rapture For my last earthly breath  -This poem did not work. No doubt. I tried to revise it, but its a lost cause. What I wanted it to imply was that Im getting sick of the world and Im just waiting for the rapture.  I just want to be in Heaven with God. -
