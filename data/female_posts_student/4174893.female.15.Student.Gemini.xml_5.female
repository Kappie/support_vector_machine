I   have   been acting like a child. I said things I shouldn't have said, and    I'm sorry   . If i were you, I don't know how I'd ever forgive me. Lon said something to me the other day, and it made me realize that I've been acting very immature. Now I realize why. You hurt me with some of the things you said and I wanted to hurt you back. Now, I completely understand if you're extremely pissed off and you never want to look at me again (because let's face it-we pretty much aren't speaking). But the thing Lon said made me realize that maybe I don't feel the way I thought I felt. I   don't   even think I   don't   like you. But, I'm sure you've quite moved on and this doesn't matter to you any more. However, now you know how I feel and whatever happens is up to you. I don't want you to think I'm all desperate or anything-I'm not. I just want you to know how I feel...so...   -------------------------------------------------------   that's all. should i give it to him or not?! someone, please, help me!
