So now I am super dizzy. It lasted for two hours. Those two hours I had saved to do the finishing touches on my mouse trap car. Those two hours wasted. Haha. Oh well. I got to watch good tv. Like the Jessica and Nick variety show and extreme make over home edition..and! Dateline. Hahha. Yeah.   So now I am SO exhausted. Those kids were scary...man. They took like 2 years off of me. Then when my nose bleed ended and I came down stairs and my mom was like yelling at me because I wasted 2 and a half hours on watching TV.  I was like there wasn't a single thing I could do!!!  When ever I got up I would just bleed over everything.  Yuckkk.  I am so dizzy I think I am going to puke.
