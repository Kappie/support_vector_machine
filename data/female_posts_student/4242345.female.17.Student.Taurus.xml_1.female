At the moment I feel ok saying to myself that the worst I can possibly get is ABCD, but really i guess it could be much worse, and they are sure to be a far cry from my AAA grades last year.  I guess I'm lucky as I can re-take next year, but the thought of going back to college having failed fills me with dread. I don't think I could face my teachers ever again if I have failed. However, part of me questions why I care so much. I wasn't brought up to think that education is the most important thing in life, in fact I was told almost the opposite. Nether the less, here I am worrying about my results.  people are constantly told that 'education is the way forward', and I do agree with this statement. However, that is not to say that school is 'the way forward'. There are plenty of ways of learning without going to school. Schools focus on teaching children to be quiet and obedient, not to constantly question their surroundings. The national curriculum is now includes subjects which have little relevance to everyday life, and all lessons are taught to meet 'assessment criteria' rather than the needs of individuals.  What happened to learning being practical and fun? What happened to learning for learning sake? Now it seems that knowledge without a grade to justify it is dismissed as useless. I think that school just teaches people that learning is about competing and is a means to an end, not that learning should be fun and embraced as something that enriches your life.  I hope that I will be happy with what I have learned at college, regardless of what grade an examiner stamps on my work at the end of it all. sadly I fear this will not be the case.
