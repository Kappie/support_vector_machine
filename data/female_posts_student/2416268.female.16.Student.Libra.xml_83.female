The walls of my house could tell some weird stories thatâ€™s for sure, mainly to do laughter it has to be said, but there would be one very interesting story that is not amusing at all, and that is now five years ago and if the walls have a memory as bad as mine, then they will have forgotten the pain that was felt by all in the Keers household! 99.9% of what the walls have heard is though madness and laughter, tears of joy rather than tears of sorrow, and long may that continue!!  Our house is a very mad house indeed!!!!!!!!!!!   These are the days that I've been missing Give me the taste give me the joy of summer wine These are the days that bring new meaning I feel the stillness of the sun and I feel fine Sometimes when the nights are closing early I remember you and I start to smile Even though now you don't want to know me I get on by, and I go the extra mile These are the times of love and meaning Ice of the heart has melted away and found the light These are the days of endless dreaming Troubles of life are floating away like a bird in flight These are the days that I've been missing Give me the taste give me the joy of summer wine These are the days that bring new meaning I feel the stillness of the sun and I feel fine   See you later my little munchkins Love ye Nat
