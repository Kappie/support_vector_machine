Movies   i just came back from watching mike moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  and let me tell you... it is not for the faint of heart. watching it, i felt a plethora of emotions. i felt saddened by the mind set of our government, happy that some truth was being told to the public so that they can make a more educated vote at the polls. and some parts of that movie was so  hilarious ! i can see why it received the highest, most prestigious award at the Cannes Film Festival. i think we're seeing some history in the making. not just the film, but mike himself. i would like anyone to inform me of the last time a documentary was so  popular  at the box office. Documentaries are usually so boring like they chose topics of like, the mating habits of algae or something that's not that relevant to you or me (but then again, i don't really watch documentaries... so... yea). i had to write that this movie was money well spent (shit, for $9 something, it was well worth it).
