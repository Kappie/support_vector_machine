It's like... invisible country... and then America decides to defend herself and this 'country' pops out of nowhere and starts pointing fingers, 'What do you think you're doing? War is BAD! War is very, VERY bad! Bad America! Time out for you!' Sure no one hates Canada. But no one likes it either. Except Canadians." -Elizabeth about this annoying Canadian she found on the internet
