Especially when:   -your parents aren't talking to each other and you have to spend 3 hours in a car on Christmas Day to be able to share the holiday with both of them.  -you have no money at all (I mean like...none...) and you want to buy everyone you know a present and donate thousands of dollars to charity to give other people some kind of Christmas (OK...I lied about the no money thing a little....I had about $15 to donate and I happily did so).  -the two presents that would make you so incredibly extremely joyously delightfully happy you'd never ask for anything again are so completely out of reach it's not even worth trying to use a telescope to see 'em, let alone figure out a way to attain them. (Yes- one of those presents is a pair of  Manolo Blahnik Okla-Mod boots ; I don't think I've ever wanted anything you can buy with money [$700 of it] THIS MUCH in my entire life.)  I don't want to make this Christmas about me, though. I want to know that I did the best I could to make everyone possible happy- after all, besides doing the hokey-pokey and turning yourself around, isn't that what it's all about?   I don't want presents this year. Instead, give me money to buy yours.   ;P  Despite my bitchy, cynical, bah-humbuggy mood towards the holiday, I love you ALL, and hope you have a Merry commercial and/or religious Christmas.
