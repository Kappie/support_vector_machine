Today I will finish cleaning and putting away my room here at the new place and then I will go over to the old place and see what a disaster it is there. There is still stuff to do but just no real energy to do it. Each time I ask for help no one around can seem tod o it and it's ticking me the heck off. I dont want to do it alone I"m tired and wore out emotionally and mentally. My health is not the best and the kids just seem to want to do things their way. My cubboards are FULL. I cant get over it. I didnt remember what it felt like to have food in the house. I even splurged and bought things I normally cant afford. Ok yeah I cant afford it but the kids need a treat because they have gone without for so long. I look around the house and think there is still so much to get done I dont even want to see the other place. Tony slept here last night which I'm glad. I dont like him spending time with Travis. I've been so busy getting things done here around the new place, things set up and in order. I did all the laundry yesterday and now I have to put my stuff away. I cant get over the junk I have gotten rid of so far. There is still so much to do though. I'm going to ask Dave if he will take the stuff in his truck and dump it somewhere for me. I also have to patch a hole in the wall that he made at the old place. Oh well. Time will see what happens with that. Well today is the 4th of July. Nothing serious going on here. Joey may be going over to RObin's for the night (I hope) which means I might get a break from all the stuff with him. He's had company the last three nights and I need a child free day. Tony might be here but not sure. I"m going to see about getting the t.v. over here and watching some movies. YAY.. Travis will throw a fit about that but I dont care anymore. He wanted me to leave the computer and t.v. over at the old place so he had something to do. Screw him. The prick also said he was almost out of gas (half a tank) and was not able to take me to do the laundry without me giving him money becuase he had to go to work on Tuesday. Yeah 1 day up there he gets his check and cashes it on his way home. He cant do it on a half a tank of gas ?? no cuz he does so much driving all over the place. He wont walk up the road to visit people he has to drive and he is very hard on his driving gunning his engine and stuff hot rodding around. But you cant tell him anything he is after all Travis and knows everything. I wish I had the courage to just tell him to get the fuck out of my life and NOT come back but I know when I do that all hell will break loose and he will cause problems for me he's already told me that. The only thing I have going for me right now is that I can say that due to on site management that he can not stay here that I have already talked to them. Even still I worry about the fight that he will give me then. He is going to see about putting Marina in jail for lying on court documents. *rolls eyes* it's gotten so ugly that whole situation and though I wish this on no one I think the best thing would be for ether Alexis to give the baby up (which she wont do) or lose it. Tony is snoring softly on the couch it sounds so sweet. Dave stopped by to see if he could use my phone. He needed to call his son in Yakima. I have unlimited long distance so I dont mind. At least he asked and didnt just walk in and do it like he use to. He even knocked ! YAY. Joey is still sleeping though I think Mike (his company) is up. It's 11 in the morning and I should get dressed and finish what I need to do so I can get to the other place. I also need to drop off the potato salad for Nadine. She is doing a bbq and invited me and the kids over but I think I wont go. I dont feel like dealing with the people that will be there. I think I will get a couple of hours over at the other place and then call it quiets and come back here. I still look daily for a letter from A.C. but nothing so far and my heart breaks each day but I am patient I think he is worth the wait and I will wait for ever for him. I did so much soul searching the last few days and I have realized so much in my life. Time will tell what happens. I've found a sense of inner peace that I can not explain. I miss M so much. We dont get to talk like we use to becuase my schedule is so up in the air and last night I called to tell her something and she was with her honey. It was great to hear her voice though I felt bad about interupting her Lol.. I hope she got lucky ! ! ! ! ! If she did she needs to write me all about it :) I love the fact that she and I can share things like that with each other. It's nice to realize that being a slut isnt a bad thing. No slut is the wrong word but I'm sure when she reads this she will understand what I mean. I write in this blog for her and for A.C.  Oh yeah.. I got one of my stories published ! I'm so excited. It's one of my erotic stories but I feel empowered by it. Ok so I know I will never be a "great" writer but I can say it's offical. :) Well back to work.
