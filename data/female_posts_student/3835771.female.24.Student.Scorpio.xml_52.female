I realise now that I needed today. To stay indoors, even though it is gorgeously sunny outside and just listen to some good music (Sweetback is still in the player), do some reading and writing for uni.  Disclaimer: The below post ended up being dreary. It wasn't meant to be.  I was able to chat to my dearest friend who lives in Portugal. S moved to Portugal after highschool and is now completing a degree in Architecture. She is coming to Australia with her beau for Christmas so it will be nice to meet her and her man. We both return to Sydney a few days from each other in December - should be nice. The only thing is that S can be too intoxicating. Over our chat I was reminded of a argument we had when we were 14. S has always been demanding - for everything. Friendship, attention, listening, dancing, and gifts. It isn't an evil thing - just in equal amounts she is generous and caring. And I totally love her. But even today I was reminded of this fact when she tapped away in our chat " I should take the time to remind you to bring me a gift from the States." She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I don't know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didn't have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadn't purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought she'd like, but the store didn't have lay-by and I hadn't saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room ("That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school"). Damage was done. We didn't speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that. I think it set the tone for how I deal with stress. I blow up and then allow the matter to deteriorate... which brings me the other issue on my mind today ...  My mother. I may have mentioned a few blogs back that there has been a silent conversation going on between my mother and I. Kind of difficult some might think seeing as we live in the same house. But with our schedules we hardly see each other ... except for today. We have both been home. She downstairs. Me upstairs in my room. This made me along with other 'signs' think about what has been going on between us. My attitude towards her has been one of avoidance from May. It an accumulative thing. Years of arguing, tension, tears, pain - we both share for a multitude of reasons, but tend to target each other as the cause of it. After last years self rebirth I came to the realisation that I probably shouldn't keep my mother as my target of said suffering. And for a while that worked. I focused on the task at hand(uni, work, health, exercise, friends, relationship), and when our communication became too much to bear for me (her criticism, nagging and guilt-ridden comments) I would retreat. But the same old same old has resurfaced. Blame my Scorpion sensibility of never letting things die, as I like to refer to determination and ALWAYS being the one in the right in May of this year I did not want to retreat casually as I had done so in the last year - I wanted to fight! Tell my mother why I am in pain. What she did and didn't do to help me. And try to drum into her that I am now an adult, capable of so much more than what she sees. She probably still sees a baby, or young thing. I am not quite sure how to change this. I worked full-time for two years before I went back fulltime to uni and started part-time work, and she was still the same. Angry and Critical. The emotional side of me goes for "Why am I the victim in this" take. The logical side of me says its a clash of egos and an argument on two different playing field.  Today, I go with the latter - but on my down days I can help but feel like the victim. The daughter who was always there to listen to her mother's woes, to help with looking after a younger sister, being well behaved, doing well at school, getting into a good uni, working in respectable good companies and organisations, having good friends and a long stable relationship with a guy who respects my family and especially my mother, being responsible, diligent, respecting my elders - ALL THOSE THINGS! But when the claws are out I am attacked on a personal level for not being good enough. And then I blow up. And fall back down at being the victim.  So the question remains... What do I do? An Aunt gave me some advice late 2003 when my mother had another episode. She asked me if I had faith. She knows that I no longer go to church every Sunday, and that I question Christianity. I answered that I do have faith. I have faith that with great belief in humanity that we can have peace and love. She asked me to pray for myself for strength to love my mother as she is and not to ask for anymore. She said with that strength I will be able to show my mother what I am capable of. The faith was for me only - for my own strength. I ask my Dad who I know is my Guardian Angel to give me that strength ever day.  My Aunt also asked me to have faith in one hand and reality in the other. She said I had two options. One was to go my own way and not deal with my Mother and our problems. The other is to use my strength and face reality that because of so many issues, my mother sees me as her point of attack. After losing her husband, my father - and feeling let down by him she has had to carry on with life and raise two children on her own. I am used as her 'punching bag' sometimes. So the choice was walking away and limiting contact with her, or staying there with inner strength, having a relatively normal relationship and every so often deal with the crap. Back then I went for the inner strength advice. Today I am not so sure. I have come to realisation that I want the following:  to talk to my mother openly about everything - past, present, future not to be criticised share her struggles and listen to her stories be loved by my mother  Right now I need to work on that on my own. For now the silence is the easiest sound to hear.  LovePeaceRespectHumility
