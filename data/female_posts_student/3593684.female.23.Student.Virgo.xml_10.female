The affirming comment you make to your employee.  It's also the little things that will kill you, or at least drive you crazy.  The friend who doesn't call you back The date that was broken with no reason The milk left on the counter for a week by your roomate The added hour of lonliness because you left work early The extra mile you drove for nought because the post-office was closed by the time you got there The little hole in your heart that grows a little bit bigger every time that stupid fucking piece of shit lying unfaithful self-centered asshole DOESN'T FUCKING CALL when he has PROMISED he would  WELL FUCK YOU!  Fuck you, MR. David.  Fuck all your bullshit about being a good friend and caring about me and being so FUCKING HONEST. Your not honest.  You can't even keep a promise.  What kind of fucking honesty is that.    The worst part is, none of the ranting, none of the crying, none of the pounding my fists on the bed does me any good.  I just need to let it go, but I can't.  I want him out of my life, and I dont do a damn thing about it. It makes me sick.  I am too tired, too pissed off to even bother spell checking.  goodnight
