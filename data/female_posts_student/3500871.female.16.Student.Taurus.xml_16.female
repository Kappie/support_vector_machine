It was, officially my first day of summer and I woke up a little disappointed to be quite honest because I realized that since my mom is still teaching for another week I don't have a ride anywhere. So I pulled out the ol' Disney movies and started watching some of my favourites: Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan. Then I realized how pathetic it was that I was spending my first day of summer watching Disney movies.... So I finished watching Beauty and the Beast and then I went to go make some plans. Courtney and I finally decided to go Corset-shopping for our next Rocky Horror. She bought a really simple, but sexy black corset while I tried on several skimpy night gowns and corsets before realizing that my corset will do me just fine. Then we went to Claire's (the perfect little girl store) and discussed which boas would look best with each person's corset and we ended up getting a black boa that I'm fairly sure we're going to make Kyle wear. And I say "make" like we really have to force him to do any of this stuff. But yeah. I phoned Kyle from my cell phone and told him we were going to catch the 8:30 show of Harry Potter. He met us there at 7:30 and we hung out for awhile before finally going into the theatre to watch the movie. It was great. I bought a shirt that says fa shizzle. I'm sorry to anyone who reads this who is black or thinks they're black. But when I saw that shirt I suddenly felt very ghetto.
