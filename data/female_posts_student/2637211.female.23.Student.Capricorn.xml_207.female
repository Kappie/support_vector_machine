I realize now that my issue with papers this quarter is that I wasn't excited about the topics, I didn't have any flashes of inspiration or insight, and I was writing papers as bored as I was. So I figure to get through this next set of papers, I really need to start early and get inspired to write something that I care about. I really do well when I compare and contrast, just because I'm good at weighing two sides of an idea or argument and picking a side by the end. It comes easily to me, and the structure and organization is easy to work out. Did you know that I'm a structure nazi? I bet you can't tell with this blog and the free flow of ideas, but when I write a paper, I can't just blindly write, I have to have a goal, an intention and an inspiration. I have to outline everything in detail before I'll even begin to write, and often that takes longer than the actual process of writing. I usually feel good about this, because one consistant comment I get on papers is that I have good organization. One the last paper I got back, the teacher wrote, "I especially liked the way you organized your paper--which I thought was particularly elegant." Yay! Elegant. That comment made my day.
