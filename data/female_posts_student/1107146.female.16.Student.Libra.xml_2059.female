I listened to Ynigwie (ING-vay, long "a") Malmsteen play some, it changed my life.   And do note that most classical pianists were heavy into guitar sometimes, surprisingly enough. Bach did quite a bit if I remember correctly, I have the music to a song of his in my room, and it's really rockin' it hardcore when played correctly.
