Today I went to Croydon again wit my sisters, they were both bargain hutning. Nancy got a pair of those rave trousers (with the tassley bits and stuff all down them, strings and whot not, lol!) and they are blue, Louise bought a couple of tops I think? I really can't rememebr! We were in Alders hours and she tried on about 10 different things, but bought nothing! What a waste of time, lol. Seeings as I've got nothing planned now until Monday, revision starts tommorrow. Anyone who reads this blog regularly will notice that I've said that every day, but this time I really mean it :(  I'm off, see you later guys.
