So, I tried to delete the MSN message but, it wouldn't let  me.  Stuff like this seems to happen in my life to. There are things I do that I can t seem to arise, really stupid things. Like stupid thigns I did way back in the seventh grade, or even the third grade. God keep stelling me to erase them and move on but i can never seem to let them go, make them leave, forever.   Today I woke up at 4 am, my nose bleeding, again. It bled for about an hour. While I was waiting in the dark for it to stop I heard loud crashing noises. The tree were colapsing under the snow and ices great weight. It was an eerie sound. First a snap then the whole branch, or even large tree, would come swishing down to the ground, its leaves muffling the loud sound that could have been caused by its great weight. It seems like snow used to be, well snow. Something that would maybe come once a year and would be gone the very next day. This is worse than just snow. It was been here for a week now ice, inches thick, covers all the snow making it nearly impossible to drive, or even walk on the snow.  Its amazing that something so light and fluffy could cause our whole city to stop for days!  even the mall is closed.  I better go eat something then I am going to clean our house...
