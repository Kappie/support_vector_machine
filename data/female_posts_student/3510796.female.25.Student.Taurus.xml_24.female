That part of the day was good, little kids planting flowers and getting into all that dirt.  Priceless.   I got a phone call from my best friend, which was very weird because at first I thought it was my cousin, she was calling from the hospital, and lately anyone calling from the hospital isn't good news.  Her mom passed away.  So I threw on some decent clothes and drove to the hospital.  She was getting ready to go back to her boyfriends, so I just met her back at his house.  This isn't so easy, dealing with the death of someone so young.  In the past 7 years I've had to see two of my uncles die, one who was only 42 and the other was 52.  I cant even begin to know how it feels to lose your dad or your mom.  I only know how it affected my cousins and my mom- losing her brother in 1998 and my dad losing his brother in 2003.     Road -- Imagine yourself in the tightest space, And you'll be here with me Staring through curtains of lace, At a mass of swirling trees It's a bumpy ride but, I'll make my way now To a place to confide, And a place where I can stay So away, go away, Out on the open road Just a place for me to go, Get away from it all The farther from home I get, The more alive I feel How could I forget the knowledge, That I am about to steal Hard to believe that, Now it's all over Slowly the sun sinks, On over into nowhere   On another note,Mo came up to me this morning and showed me a penny and said, "I'm rich."  Oh to be that young again when you think you're rich when you have pocket change.  He is also the one who says, "Let's go to the store and get some money."
