Because the Napha test was soon to be here again. And  VERY  soon to be here, it was starting for the sec1s tomorrow, which was probably a surprise for them, but for us, we had one week for the preparation. It was such a "pleasant" surprise. Sigh. I'm really scared that I might fail for this upcoming physical test, just like the passed years. I haven't passed for a single time in my life! It was such a misery... I'm really really scared! The urge. The feeling. No one can understand those kind of pain being behind and the slowest at speed everywhere. It was so scary. It is a nightmare. It had always been my greatest fear, the Napha test... I can do well almost for everything with practice but napha? I simply can't... I can never... It will be a miracle if there is.  Sigh.  Sometimes I really wished I can do everything if I had the will. But this is too much to be true. It's not about your thinking, it's about your real strength and weakness...
