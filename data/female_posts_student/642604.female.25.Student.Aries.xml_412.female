     
      Okay so Friday started out as a normal day.  Came into work, did some work, listened to Reagan's funeral... and bided my time before getting to leave the office for the day.  Finally around 1 I took off for the corporate office to meet up with everyone before heading over to the Carteret Bowling Party in Centreville.  From the moment getting to the bowling alley we were drinking, this at 2 mind you.  There was sips of rum and cokes, full glasses of beer, two tequilla shots, and did I mention the asti?  So after getting liquored up there and I am sure making a fool out of myself.  I remember at one point making some comment about a guy I thought was gone but who was actually bending over to pick up a bowling ball.  I was damn embarrassed about that.  I remember discussing the person I referred to as Mr. Miserable in a previous post with the girl we think he's been seeing... and the shocking part is she was kind of cute.  She must be damn hard up if she's trying to get with Miserable.  Jen, Pandy and I were out of control but God was it fun!  I remember at one point having discussions with Mike, Bert, and Jeff but really I just remember the drinking.  I didn't black out if that's what you're all worried about, I can remember being there the whole time I just can't remember small details.  I remember cheering for Bert.  So then I know I need to sober up before making the long drive home (long being fifteen minutes).  So I agree to go to Happy Hour with Jess, Michelle, Eric, Mike, Bert, Pandy, and whoever else was invited.  Oh Kim was there too.  So we head over to Glory Days and I have already called my friend Eric to tell him I would meet him at Jess's around 9 that night.  It was seven, I would stay for an hour and leave.  Simple.  Easy.  Wrong.  So I just kept drinking and eating at happy hour.  I talked to people I had never met before.  Anyway so eventually Pandy, who is responsible, has to leave.  So she goes and I keep drinking.  I call Eric (my friend) and leave him a voicemail letting him know I won't be there at 9 and that he can come over to Glory Days if he wants.  This was about 8:30.  I remember arguing with Bert and Mike over their comment that every woman wants to change something about the man that they are with.  I disagreed.  I didn't say most women didn't want to but my point was that not ALL women were out to change the guys they were with.  I remember arguing with Mike over whether or not he was a player and somewhere in this I argued with Michelle too over whether or not Mike was a player.  My side of the argument is that Mike is too nice a guy to be considered a player.  This is the truth by the way.  So anyway, this is where the conversation itself becomes a bit hazy agin, I am not nearly as drunk as I was at the bowling party but you have to remember I am still drinking.  So at one point it gets on the subject of how generations differ and how what was taboo for the generation of the majority of people sitting around the table is not taboo for my generation unless you are considered a prude.  Somehow the topic of my burnt nipple came up.  So then Carolyn is all like "I want to see it" and everyone else is cheering this at this point too and I'm like no.  So they won't stop giving me flak about it and Bert jumps in saying no one can see it because it's a "bert" nipple.  He saved me.  So then Carolyn keeps insisting and finally I'm like what the hell do I care.  But it's not like a flashed everyone mind you.  Carolyn came over and I moved my shirt and bra so that if she was looking over my shoulder she could see but no one else could.  That was the end of that.  She did touch it which I thought was funny but that was it, it was over.  So then I start hearing Carolyn talk about her boob job and I'm like Oh Shit here we go.  Needless to say that she was quite proud.  So eventually after much conversation and after Bert has finally agreed with me that not EVERY woman wants to change her guy and after we've listened to drunk mike go on about this and that.  And after I've joked about Bert not being allowed to hear and see certain things going on at the table without my permission, we are instructed that enough people have left and Bert and I need to move up to the end of the table where Carolyn, Scott, Michelle, Eric, Chris, Todd, Derek and other people I didn't know were at.  This was where it got interesting.  So we're sitting up there and at first Bert sits next to Carolyn and she tells him to move because she wants to sit next to me.  So we switch seats.  I can't remember the order of events here but needless to say at one point Carolyn pretty much flashed everyone and her boobs were not only right in my face but in Bert's as well and Mike had a pretty good view himself.  And we're not talking quick flash or tease we're talking they were out and she was proud.  I was cracking up at Bert and Mike's faces.  Then Carolyn wanted me to feel... um... okay.  So needless to say because it does nothing for me I did.  It was interesting from a straight female perspective because I have never been one to grab boobs and so to be quite honest I have never felt a pair of fake ones before.  They're much harder for those who want to know, not really soft to the touch.  Anyway, none of this has phased me much at all, if nothing I am more or less laughing at the guys reactions.  I've been in more interesting sitauions before... this was nothing.  So the night continued.  At one point I remember Mike telling Julie that he would "take care of her" and Michelle was encouraging it.  Julie gave Mike her phone number.  I remember at one point having to finally explain that Bert and I were actually not together at all and that it was a big joke.  There were definitely some disappointed people there at that point which I found even funnier.  One lady in particular seemed sad that we weren't a real couple.  I just didn't feel like dealing with another Carteret rumor circulating or I would've let that one go on longer.  Fortunately I know that Bert is a smart guy and understands it's all a joke.  All of the rumors have been jokes but I am not always sure if the other person involved in the rumor knows that.  Which is unfortunate maybe because Bert and I have a lot of fun with it and I can't do the same with others cause I don't know if they think I am serious or not.  But now I am off track.  So finally after listening to Michelle explain that she doesn't need to show her boobs but that hers are real and fabulous I decide it is definitely time to get the hell out of there.  I get home that night and there is this message from Eric written on the driveway in some of Austin's chalk... guess he didn't get my voicemail.    So anyway, wake up the next day and Eric shows up and we are just waiting on Jeff so we can drive over to the office.  Yeah so I told him 6:15am, at 6:25am I called just to make sure he wasn't lost.  I couldn't get a hold of him.  I tried again at 6:30am and told him we were leaving.  So no Jeff.  I was just a little pissed at him.  I got over it though.  The boy doesn't owe me a damn thing and so quickly I got over being upset and decided I had nothing to get upset about.  So we get to the office and we wait around and everyone shows up... except some of the people who claimed the night before that they were going to go and Mike. Everyone tries calling Mike, no answer.  Finally we have to leave without him.  No Jeff.  No Mike.  Pandy and I grab seats in the back not far from Jim and Jess.  Eric is in the front, where Bert and his wife are sitting mind you, and Michelle is in the front so we feel we're safe.  No.  Eric comes back and sits next to Jessica. And what we didn't notice was that Tom and his wife were sitting a couple of rows in front of us as were Bob and his wife.  Oh and wouldn't you know it... they hit it off.  They all loved each other.  TOOLS!  Oh my God Tom's wife is the most annoying woman alive.  Sorority loud mouth freak.  No offense.  At one point Pandy and I were cracking up because she pulled out her breast pump on the bus.  WHO DOES THAT!  As far as I know she didn't use it but God knows I wasn't looking too hard.  I was trying to hide from it all.  Pandy and I giggled about random things like my new band's name "Clitoris Sky", various office hi-jinx, her addiction to her cell phone, Mike's inability to wake up on time, and whatever else we could think of.  We cringed at the jokes and comments that Eric felt the need to make behind us and we viciously tore apart Tom, his wife, Bob and his wife (to ourselves of course.)    So we get there and we head straight for food because we're both a little hung over and need grease.  We eat at the Hard Rock Cafe in the Taj.  We hit Roulette and at this point I am with Kim, Pandy and my friend Eric who won't gamble yet.  I'm like WHHHAAAATTTT!  So I win at Roulette.  Head over to Craps.  Loose about sixty bucks.  At this point I have lost Eric and Kim but Bert and his wife find us.  We decide to leave the Taj which is boring and rundown and head for the Borgata.  We taxi over.  I did try and find Eric and Kim before leaving by the way.  So here is where I have to recommend the Borgata to everyone who is going to AC because most of Atlantic City is trash and pales in comparison to Vegas but the Borgata can hold it's own.  It's still not a Vegas hotel but it's close.  So we go looking for a Black Jack table but we're only seeing $15 and $25 minimum tables and I am just not that good.  So I am forcing Pandy to gamble at least once before we leave so she and I hit the slots while Bert is trying to get in on a $15 table.  Next thing I know Bert and his wife are passing by saying on the other side they are opening at $10 table.  We head over and Bert and I play Black Jack for a couple hours while Pandy and Bert's wife look on.  We had an f-in fantastic table.  Everyone was laughing, helping each other.  I went up and down but I didn't give a crap.  Bert was up most of the time.  I had expected to lose the full $200 I brought and was even ready to take out another $100 to lose if need be.  That was all money I could afford to kiss goodbye.  But I had a good time and I walked away from the table with $75 so technically I only lost $125.  Not bad.  Anyway, this part is getting boring for you I'm sure.  We head back over to the Taj to meet up with everyone before going home.    So we get back on the bus and thank God Eric went back to go to sleep or I would've shot someone.  Pandy and I continued to rip apart the Tools yet again.  We got a hold of Kim's Vanity Fair and drooled over Beckam for a while.  G-DAMN he's hot!  Then there was a blank bumper sticker ad inside the magazine that said "I 'heart'" and then you had to write something.  So Pandy and I wrote TOOLS and cracked up about it for hours.  At one point Tom's wife said something and I said a little too loudly "SHUT UP TOOL!" and that once again provided entertainment.  OH!  I didn't mention the nuclear power plant!  Holy cow!  LARGEST BONG EVER!  Haha!  I totally forgot about that for a second there.  Oh Pandy makes me laugh.  So needless to say we get to the rest stop and we go in to get food and when we come out, because Pandy and I are rejects, we are giggling every time we see Tom's wife.  Tool.  There was inappopriate touching between a certain owner as he helped Pandy off the bus... GROSS!  So anyway I am inside getting food and I pay and as I am putting my food in a bag and waiting for my friend Eric and Pandy Tom's wife comes over and starts talking.  I am in such a rush to get the hell away from her that I bolt.  This part will be important in a minute.  So we get back on the bus, eat, watch XMen-2 and finally we arrive at home.  Pandy and I have now decided to just go home and not go out.  So I pick up my purse and notice it is extremely light.  Hmmm... no wallet.  I paid for food in DE and it's not on the bus.  Must be in DE.  I must have bolted so quickly from the TOOL BITCH that I left it sitting there.  So we call and I am all freaking out more or less because my social security card is in there and not for any other reason.  I could've cared less about the money or the cards. I just was freaked about the social.  So finally we get the woman at the DE House (By the way WORST REST STOP ALONG THAT ROAD!  I WAS PISSED WE STOPPED THERE ON THE WAY TO ATLANTIC CITY AND EVEN MORE PISSED ABOUT STOPPING ON THE WAY HOME!) and the woman let's us know that she has it and it looks like everything is in tact.  So they're sending it to me and I'll have it on Wednesday.  So that's about it.  Everyone go pick up the new single by Clit!  :)  Threw that in there for you HO!  So there you go.
