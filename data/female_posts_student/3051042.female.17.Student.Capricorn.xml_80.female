I feel so much better but I still want to cry... damn whore-moans.   Ah... "I'm over it." lol. I love you Mike.   Well, off to class I go. You just know Mr. Riccobono is going to find me and bitch me out even more about my attendance. Oh well. I still can't believe I got that wrapped up into emotions. Jeeze... I've got to stop listening to Emo music. I get myself into the weirdest situations. In the words of Michelle Colon... "That was fucking clown shoes."
