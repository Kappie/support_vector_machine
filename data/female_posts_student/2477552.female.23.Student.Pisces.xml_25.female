Her heart lines  had been torn wide-open winding in pools  and cascading down toward the drain  Her eyes turn to face the mirror Watching herself look out  the window towards downtown.   Sprite, belong to the truth  And you will no longer  Hear the deafening sounds of  Hot lusty silence and a mind  Lost in the spinning of its gears.  Hail the mighty rabbit,   Who consecrates herself to  Her most recent devotion. The sweet cold mystery,  Piercing and yet calming like rain. Seduces the harsh and irresistible As she goes about setting up Her fortress in the plain.  Her mother condemns this Vindictive acid-washed tearful pain.  Charming the snake mascara To slide beautifully down her face To reside for a moment on her chin And drip, down to the drain.   Now, Heart lines sew yourselves back up. Stop you’re blubbering. Stop this constant drain of these Half-hearted emotions, Because the fantasy wasn’t real. And the nightmare was only a dream.  That lost lonely girl inside her  has suddenly grown stronger. She can force those fake tears no longer. And she stands looking in that mirror Seeing her youth looking  As vibrant and lively as ever. With two glossy pouted lips  And a brush-full of blusher.   This is what I sent in for the women's center journal. Hopefully they will like it and put it in. :) Keep your fingers crossed.  Now that I've been volunteering there, I really like it. The women are very supportive and you feel yourself trying to support others too. Check out their website.
