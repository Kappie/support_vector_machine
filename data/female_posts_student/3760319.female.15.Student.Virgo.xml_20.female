He claims on how much he misses me but yet he goes out and parties all the time (all the stuff i wanted to do while we were going out. like go to juarez) and then last night he went to juarez and was in the get low contest and won. he didnt even invite me wtf.. and today he invites me. im like oh ok yea invite me when its just going to be me n you. how bout no! tonite im going with cortez and i guess i'll just have to find a place to stay the night cuz i told my mom that i was staying the night at jazmine's house. but yea so im not sure what we are doing tonite but im gonna have more fun than victor did last night. oh and he tries to tell me that he didnt dance then later tells me he was in the get low contest.. rrright. and then he tells me that he didnt drink either. i really just dont care anymore. this is another reason why i dont want to get back together with him. but whatever. it doesnt matter anymore.
