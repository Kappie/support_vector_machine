Jay and Alix prolly already have gf's and i'll be looking in on their happy lives from the "outside" maybe if i had developed social skills when i was little i'd be like normal. Ha not instead my k-8th grade years were spent crying in the girls bathroom at the end of the field..the farthest from all the kids and it smelled so no one went in it. My life looks so awsome because i put on an act woohoo ya for all u guys who thought i had the COOLEST life ur mistaken i didn't really even have friends until freshman yr, my first real relationship was this yr and now i'm spilling my guts over the internet Smoothe move caci!  bye  urlLink
