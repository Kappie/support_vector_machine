PARIS -- Second seed Andy Roddick slumped out of the French Open on Wednesday in a shocking five-set defeat by Frenchman Olivier Mutis.       Mutis won 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2, as the U.S. Open champion found himself outplayed under darkening Paris skies.   Roddick's erratic effort showed he's still learning how to play on clay. He blew an easy volley to lose serve in the opening game of the final set, then began to play too aggressively. He became increasingly dispirited as his mistakes mounted and fell behind 5-0.   "I was waffling," Roddick acknowledged. "I wasn't decisive enough. I wasn't sticking with things I wanted to do."    Mutis, a 26-year-old Frenchman ranked 125th, served his 10th ace to close out the victory. It was just the second five-set win of his career, and it delighted the small crowd watching the final match of the day at Court Suzanne Lenglen.   Mutis, who advanced to the third round of a major event for the first time, said the win was the biggest of his career.   "I really enjoyed myself," he said. "I hope to go farther."   Mutis, who had not won a match this year prior to the tournament, mixed up his play superbly to undo Roddick, 21, in a see-saw encounter and sealed victory with an ace after 3 hours, 11 minutes.   "He was a different player the latter part of the match than he was at the beginning," Roddick said. "That was my fault that I let him back into the match."   Cool, damp evening conditions cost Roddick some of his power. He hit 15 aces but lost his serve nine times.   Roddick's second-round appearance, although not his best effort in Paris, which was the third round in 2001, was an improvement after losing in the first round the past two years.   The exit of Roddick, who has been suffering from a stomach upset, meant the United States has no representatives left in the men's singles draw.   No. 27-seeded Vince Spadea was also beaten, leaving no American in the men's draw midway through the second round. Spadea, who erased nine match points in a first-round victory, lost to Julien Jeanpierre 6-4, 6-2, 7-5.   The next highest seed at No. 3, Guillermo Coria overcame a slow start to beat qualifier Juan Monaco 7-5, 6-1, 6-3.    Coria, a semifinalist last year, lost four of the first five games and needed more than an hour to pull out the first set. He rallied from a service break down in the third set.   "I knew it would be a difficult beginning to the match, that he would give me everything he had," Coria said. "I finished the match very well, and I'm playing well."    Coria had 29 winners and just 25 unforced errors against fellow Argentine Monaco, who was playing in his first Grand Slam tournament. Monaco was hurt by 10 double faults but kept Coria the court for nearly 2Â½ hours.    A French Open junior champion in 1999, Coria is seeking his first Grand Slam title. He has won 33 of his past 34 clay-court matches, with the only loss to top-ranked Roger Federer in this month's Hamburg final.   "I know there are difficult matches ahead," Coria said. "Everyone is here to win, as am I."   Former French Open champion Carlos Moya took just 78 minutes to clinch a bittersweet victory over fellow Spaniard and best friend Fernando Vicente at Roland Garros on Wednesday.   The 27-year-old won 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 for his 11th straight victory against Vicente to stroll into the French Open third round.   "Well, it's not easy. He's my best friend on the tour, and I know he's having a hard time now because he was injured for a long time," Moya said.   Having lost all 10 previous matches against Moya, Vicente appeared to merely go through the motions on Court Suzanne Lenglen and never looked like denting the baseliner's game.   Moya seemed unable to look his friend in the eye during the the one-sided contest.   "Well, what I can say is I didn't have fun at all today, although I played a very good match and I won in straight sets playing solid," Moya said.   Moya, champion in Paris in 1998, is seeded fifth this time round and faces Dutchman Raemon Sluiter next.   No. 9 Tim Henman marched through to the third round with a 6-0, 6-3, 6-3 demolition of Germany's Lars Burgsmueller.   The ninth-seeded Henman wrapped up the first set in only 20 minutes with a near-flawless display of shotmaking and Burgsmueller, ranked 91st, was never in contention after that.   Henman plays Spanish clay specialist Galo Blanco in the third round.    In other men's play, two-time runner-up Alex Corretja, beat No. 13 Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. No. 22 Juan Ignacio Chela defeated Fernando Verdasco 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.
