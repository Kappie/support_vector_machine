God i hate myself for thinking that my life is so horrible when there are all those other people in the world who havent even gone to a school, or a doctor, or all that stuff i take for granted. i want all you folks out there to enjoy everything in your life, and appreciate it to the fullest because theres no tellin when its all gonna go away. whew, got a little too deep there for my teenage stupid brain to comprehend.. but i guess thats not a bad thing then, right?
