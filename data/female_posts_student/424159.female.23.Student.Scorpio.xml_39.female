Even though we didn't eat our official dinner at home like we have since 1985, Ryan's Steakhouse on W. 161 gave a bountiful feast that we were thankful for.    I also have discovered some other things I am thankful for.    1.  My family.  Even though I moved out and they piss me off a lot, I still love them.   I miss them a lot, too.  I think they have more respect for me now that I'm on my own, and I think I have more respect for them as my family now that I'm out on my own.  Love ya guys.  2.  My job.  Yes, even though I work a lot and I get tired of shit there sometimes, I still love my job and my co-workers.  It's like a second family, especially with Sharon being my second mom and all.  I have come to find a great deal of respect and admiration for my co-workers and our profession.  I would like to take this opportunity to give a special shout out to Nitia, who has become like an idol to me.  She's a very smart and authoritive woman, which seems to be a problem for other people who don't take the time to get to know her and listen to what she has to say.  For those with hate for Nitia, bite me.  I hope your recovery goes well, Nish.  I know I'll miss you.  3.  Sharon.  What can I say?  I know you'll probably read this, so I want to take the time to let you know just how important you are to me.  There was a time not so long ago where I didn't have the strength or will to even get up in the morning.  Everything seemed to go wrong.  Then you came along and took me under your wing, mending me and showing me things I never knew were worth looking for within myself.  I am eternally grateful to you and all your wisdom.  Thanks again, Mom.  Well, another Thanksgiving has came and gone, but the things I am thankful for are eternal.  I hope you were blessed today as much as I was.
