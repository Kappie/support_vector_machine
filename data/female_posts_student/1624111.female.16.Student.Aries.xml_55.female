Most teenagers like parties, most like concerts, most like sleepovers, most like attending sports games, some like seeing plays, most like going to the movies... i dunno, most teenagers generally like lots of things. But its funny how you can do the exact same thing with one of your friends and not have as much fun...not that you wouldnt have any fun, just.. like...the difference between "how was it?" "it was cool" and "how was it?" "omg that was the greatest thing ever!!! when can we go again?"... mmm, i dunno. just..,funny how Martha prefers fun like a Good Charolette concert..and i much perfer fun like talking and laughing with friends at 2:00 in the morning. eh, what you value... or maybe its not so much the "fun" but just... how it makes you feel... sure, concerts are fun...cool music and stuff... but...donde esta la paz? it feels good to talk to your friends late into the night. better than it does to jump around while sining along to music so loud you cant hear anything when you leave. not that thats not fun, cause it is, its just... i dunno. i like the former.  yeah, im done rambling. basically sleepover>concert.
