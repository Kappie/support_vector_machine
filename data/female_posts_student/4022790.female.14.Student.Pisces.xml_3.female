This afternoon was ok...anchorman was good even though i have already seen it...and then i came home and went to work out with my Madre and brother...which was just awesome..lol then we went   to pick up dinner and now im watching spiderman with them because I havent seen it before. WeLl idk why i put this entry in but i was bored...So enjoy. Tomorrow Ive got church in the morning and I   am still SoOo tired from jenn's house last night. (it was so fun tho) WeLl anyways im gonna go finish this movie then probably watch another, Most likely "The Bourne Identity" because I havent   seen that either and I want to see the sequel. Well Im out..i'll edit again tomorrow!       -kRiStA*
