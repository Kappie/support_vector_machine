Everyone that was there has been joking about how he has found his new daughter-in-law. I guess its good that I can laugh about it, but it was embarrassing as hell. He did take my friend Leatta's pic too so atleast i'm not the only one, but I am pretty sure he just did that to make me feel better. In other news... there is no news, but nonews is good news so we willleave it at that.   Tiff its cool that you are on a new diet. I wish I had your will power to do that myself. However I love food and it loves me so I don't think it is going to happen.
