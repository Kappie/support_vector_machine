I was on the phone with them for 20 minutes and ran over my lunch break waiting for some dumb heifer with the mental speed of a blind deaf-mute to tell me that she can mail me a computer transcript of my tax return, but she cannot send me a photocopy of the one I signed because they don't "keep" those. Hello?!?!? Aren't you the GD IRS? Don't you people keep  every-fucking-thing?   Yeah, I'll probably be audited next year (though, good luck with that, morons- I have nothing. Nothing!!!).  In other news, I completely subterfuged one of my coworkers today to get more money and recognition for myself. And it worked, amazingly enough. I feel kind of bad for her, because she's gonna be pissed when she comes to work tomorrow and finds that things have changed for her, but... oh, well. I have enough to worry about.  Like my boss finding out I am moving out of the state in two months. With all of the perks I am getting right now, it would be disastrous if my evil, nefarious plans came to light before I'm ready.  I'm not manipulative, I'm just drawn that way.  BTW, can I just say that I think it is so funny that Courteney Cox named her new baby girl Coco. As in Chanel. Or "I'm cuckoo for Coco puffs."  And I also think it's hilarious how Blogger will advertise certain things on your blog that they see in your posts. For example. Mine is now advertising tequila after this past weekend's debacle. Maybe I should write an entire post about herpes and see if they advertise something along those lines.  Or... maybe not.  My car is acting progressively worse and I am scared to get behind the wheel. I know I am pushing my luck and every trip may be my last. God, if you let me make it through the next few weeks without breaking down, I'll be very, very good. I'll eat my veggies and drink lots of water and be nicer to everyone.  Oh, who am I kidding? After that b.s., God may decide to blow up the car with me in it (but please, please don't.)  Posh told us a joke today at work that her dad, of all people, told her.  "What did one saggy tit say to the other?" "We'd better get some support before somebody thinks we're nuts."
