Really liked the small bit about Pinocchio. Hehe.  And I'm on Level 16 now at Gothador. Whee~! Now my best AP regen time is 13 minutes. **grins**  Step, you've got to start playing. I'll even help by giving you a Short Sword.  And Mary... I doubt if you'd pay attention to the shark if Orlando Bloom is swimming in front of you. Hmmm.
