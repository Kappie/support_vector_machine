Today was such an unbelievable roller coaster. I went from feeling like my world had crashed down, to now feeling that I may just have a purpose in life. Or something to work toward, anyway. Well, at church, everything pretty much sucked. Kirsten told me she wan't staying for 11:00 service, she wanted to be with Brian later.    I can just hear Ellen's tone of voice as she says this. She is pissed off and takes it the wrong way. I had told him the night before that I was going to 6 pm service. Wow. Big deal. He's my BF. Learn to share.    And then Kris Ohm tells me that she can't take me to Something Corporate because it's the same weekend her sister is coming down. I'm not angry at her or blame her one bit, though, let's just make that clear. But.. you know, this is Something Corporate, so I can't help it that in the car when I'm driving Kirsten home between Sunday School and church that I'm like silently crying, and tears are just streaming down.     Ok, I know that she loves SC, but I would think that instead of sitting there and crying about it, she'd be trying to find other ways to get there...    "Is this because I'm not going to 11:00?" And then goes on about how I'm too touchy and she's scared I'm going to get angry at everything, blah blah blah.    Acutally it was more like "I know that this isn't the best time to bring this up or anything [this is where she got her next couple lines from... stealing my words], but you have been sooo touchy lately. And everything that I do I have to think about it, and I worried that it will upset you." Oh, and also, during Sunday School when I said that I wasn't going to 11 am service and Ellen made some sort of huff, I told her that I never say 'no' to her, so I don't know why she is pissed off about these things, and she didn't take that very well either. And I love it how she fails to mention that the reason that she was driving me home was because she made me ask a bunch of the sponsors to go on the camping trip, so my dad got pissed off and left the church after looking for me for 10 minutes.    I'm not a freaking time bomb, I am capable of my emotions, and I think I do a damn good job of handling situations.     Hmm I beg to differ. You let things build up inside you and distort them in your mind, making them something they are not. This is evident in your post here and others before it. Although you may not exploded, you are holding it inside just ticking away until one day you do explode... Hmm capable of your emotions? How come you have to relieve stress by smoking when there wasn't even a stressful situation.    But yeah, not the best time to bring up all this.    Thanks for stealing my words.    So I tell her to get out of the car.    Umm no. You just sat there. You didn't say anything to me. ??? WTF is this?    I drove back to church, and just sat in the parking pot, listening to Konstantine, just trying to calm down.    If you knew that what I said wasn't true, then why did it affect you this way? You know that what I tell you has some basis, and you just have a hard time accepting the truth.    Then I went into the church and sat at the back for a while. I saw Hunter sitting by himself, so I went over to join him, and all he does is bitch and complain about Kirsten. I finally just told him that if he wants to say all this stuff, he should just say it to her himself, because I can't and won't do anything about it.    I am so freaking annoyed by that kid... Words can't begin to describe. I haven't talk to him in over 2 weeks. Maybe 3. Why the hell does he still want to talk to me? He fucked things up, now I think he is annoying. End of story.    Yeah, so I hate how Ellen distorts things into something that they are not. Someone needs to smack her back to reality.
