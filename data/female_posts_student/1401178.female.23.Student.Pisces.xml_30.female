If I was to surrender to the lost of the fight, start the journey home to the man-who-will-accept-me-as-I-am with my tail between my legs...It would be somehow a very tragic defeat indeed. I am such a fighter inside, but somehow that spirit doesn't translate outside.  ...  Or maybe it's just because this anxiety that I have after a very surprising and shocking accident at Silverstone, which unfortunately was involving Trulli. Luckily, he is unhurt and ready for the next race. Damn it...I could've had a heart attack.
