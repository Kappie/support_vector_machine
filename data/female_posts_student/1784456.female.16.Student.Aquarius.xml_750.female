Oh yeah! Well, in technology we're doing airline meals and me and Izzy are doing a flight to Sandwich Island! I went on this website and found a few... faults with this! Hehe stupid! Population: no indigenous population; there is a small military garrison on South Georgia, and the British Antarctic Survey has a biological station on Bird Island; the South Sandwich Islands are uninhabited *COUGH COUGH COUGH* (I don't think any one noticed!)  Highways:  total: NA km  paved: NA km  unpaved: NA km  Ports: Grytviken   Airports: none   That could kind of make it hard for the airoplane to land! But shhh don't tell any one and I don't think they will notice!
