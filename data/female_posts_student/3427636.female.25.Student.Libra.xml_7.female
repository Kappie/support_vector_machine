I am now owner of the complete series of  Firefly , and as of approx. 11.30pm last night, I'm hooked.  I also bought a few books. The one I'm looking forward to the most is  The Davinci Code  by Dan Brown.  Went and saw Arthur... More thoughts on that later.   Release the giant mind-controlled swans that can control minds!
