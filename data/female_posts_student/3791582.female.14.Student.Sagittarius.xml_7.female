IT WAS AWESOME. the party started at 10pm (im totally serious) and we all ended up leaving around 4:30am. what made it the awesome shin-dig that it was happened to be my two friends from CT, courtney and bridget, who came down for the event. we decorated, we ate, we drank, we tried watching dvd's, and we killed a slug with salt on the porch...very very good time. my most memorable night of the summer so far. then bridget stayed for a week and we got to hang out then too. it was pretty sick. i've been BEGGING the parental unit for a new computer and i finally got my wish! there were some terms tho...i have to start prepping for the SAT this summer and through my sophmore year (basically until i take the test). i think it's ridiculous but hey, if it gets me my new comp im in. apart from that not much is going on...i'm not writing as much as i was before, maybe i lost my inspiration? who knows. hopefully i'll be back on the map soon!   sarah a.k.a smokeycustard
