I keep thinking about the social test and it is driving me up that wall!!!  but well I am just one of those natural worry people so yeah.  And well Alex asked me out and stuff so we shared a salad and some fries for lunch and well then we disscussed how like we should go out a couple times and see what happens from there.  And well I suppose the Chem test today went pretty good.  I mean I think I did good at least and well I really prepared for that thing so yeah I don't really think there is anymore I could have done.  I feel pretty good right now again.  Chels came to my house for a while then my mom, chels, and I when out to dinner then me and chels went to South Centre to shop and I got some chopsticks for my hair and a new belt - oh it is soooo cool.  And well we invited Ash but she wanted to watch football so like whatever!  I just hope I understand my math a little bit more tommorow when I try to practice the stuff and well I should review my chem, but I have lotsa social studying and stuff cause I think I am gonna write the test on tuesday.
