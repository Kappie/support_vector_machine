Yeah, anyway...I spent most of it with my brother and his girlfriend. She's leaving next week. :( I'm going to miss her. She's so cool. We're going downtown to hang out with them this weekend though. Plus...we're going to the Rembrandt exhibit!!! YES! It'll be amazing X like....twenty...  Today was one of my two full days of school this week. tomorrow's the Wind Ensemble NIU thing. Good times. I just don't want to be wearing my concert black all day. Anyway, Thursday's a half day and Friday we have no school. Good, good times!   I really have nothing else to say. I'm too tired to really type anything. I think I might be getting over...errr...."it" too. I don't know. I've thought that a lot though and then something happens and....there it is again. Oh well. We shall see, we shall see.
