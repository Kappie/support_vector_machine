Anne grows up not remembering her past before her new family until one day as a teen she is told by her white parents that she is aboriginal. This sends Anne into a confused struggle for her identity. Is she black or is he white?  	Unlike the other characters in stolen Anne has grown up being educated and well looked after. In all the scenes where the others are standing reminiscing their losses and troubles Anne exclaims on her material benefits. Anne is left very confused in the line up scenes as she doesn’t remember the home and is frequently ignored in her questions of reason “But why?”  	Anne’s good fortune for being chosen is represented in the book by a white doll that she receives from her white adoptive parents. The doll symbolises a new beginning, a new life with a sense of security, a good education and a good “white” upbringing.  	Although Anne doesn’t suffer from the loss of her family throughout her childhood after discovering that her true heritage is aboriginal she becomes confused with who she is and she loses the identity that she had become.  	In scenes such as “ to tan or not to tan” and “ Am I black or white” we see her struggle with the concepts of being both black and white. In “to tan or not to tan” her troubles are portrayed more as a joke. As she pulls at her milky white skin laughing at the fact she lays there smothered in coconut oil attempting to tan when she is black. That is until the end where the reality of her situation sets in.  	Both families escalate her problems as the pressure of making a decision between the two in “ Am I black or white”. In this scene it also shows her lack of understanding of her aboriginal family. She expects them to be more “at one with the land” as she puts it and is rather disappointed to find that they are all crowded in to a commission flat.  	“Am I black or white” is a scene that truly documents the pressures she is emplaced with as both families lay a guilt trip on her. Both want he to be with them and both make her feel that she has to earn her place as a part of the family,. It also gives off the impression that she is surrounded with people that want her love but she is somehow left feeling alone as the two families trap her both screaming the exact same thing at her.  	 All throughout Anne’s life her white adoptive parents have told her that she is special because they chose her, however in this she is frequently reminded that she should feel privileged as she is and should feel lucky and grateful to them for all that they have done for her  Again in “Am I black or white” we get the feeling that the white family feels she should be appreciative as the mother bellows that she’s given Anne everything and to leave would be breaking their hearts, The father is much more straightforward, questioning Anne’s appreciation and telling her that if she goes to her aboriginal family he wont take her back in. 	            The whites also bring shame to Anne for being Aboriginal in “Anne’s told she is aboriginal” It is clear that they kept it from her but in saying that no one need ever know and that she only has to see her mum once they show that they are ashamed of her being aboriginal and they treat it as if it can easily be ignored.   Although Anne is deeply affected by all of this her hopes seem to rely on the chance that two families will learn to get along and she can live being both black and white. However deep down she knows this cannot ever happen. We see this directly as she addresses the audience in Anne’s scene and maturely tackles the problem. She is left still not quite knowing who she is, still struggling for her identity but she has grown enough to realise that she is lucky enough to have two families, and smart enough to love them both. And to live as Anne, whether that is being black or white.
