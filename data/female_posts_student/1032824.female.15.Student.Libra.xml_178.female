Rahil reminded me about our exchange of presents today and I suddenly felt somewhat excited. I was actually dreading to go to school next week due to the intensive mother tongue lessons. Yet now, I am looking forward to next week! And the week after next, until I receive Avril's album from her. *Hee Haa! It's silly, we're both purchasing Avril's album and wrapping it up before exhanging gifts. It makes me happy when I see the smile on the faces of people whom I care for.    We had our Passing Out Parade (POP) today. Took photos, with my kids, with the NCOs. Gosh, I will miss taking my Sec 3s. All the best to my kids in maintaining the unit! It's all up to you guys now! Love you all lots. *Hugs* Don't let Sadhiq and I down alright? :)    Be gone with the wind..  Wooosh!  *Tee hee!* I am going to sleep now so that I can have enough energy to last me through the night.
