(*snifffff*)   ah....i can smell them cooking...I am not that good of a cook, i just use those box recipes where the only thing you have to add is 100mL cold water. Simple. Yet still i always get stains all over me or make them too gooey or burn them. Its the casey lifestyle. Mmm...the best thing 'bout making cakes is licking the bowl...whenever my mum is around she quickly rinses the bowl while i'm puting the muffins in the oven to burn. But not today, today i've mastered the art of holding the bowl firmly with my right hand, opening the oven door with my chin, and putting the muffins in with my left hand. Truly brilliant. Big step for me. Next i may even be able to put the muffins down and then open the oven door with my  hand , then pick the muffins up and put them in the oven! What a day that shall be... Oh crud! I forgot! My muffins! G2G! Luv Kc
