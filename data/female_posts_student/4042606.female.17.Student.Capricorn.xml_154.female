Usually it would be the other way around. I guess I can't complain though, this is the first night I have been able to just sit around and do nothing. I finally can have sometime for myself, in which I can reflect on my life. Actually I think I am going to get drunk and watch  urlLink Cool Runnings  until I finally pass out on my floor. It sounds like a plan to me, so I won't be posting until sometime tomorrow.
