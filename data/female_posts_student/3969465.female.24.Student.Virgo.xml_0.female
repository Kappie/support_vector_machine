My name's 'Simone'- I have recently been told by some French fellow that it's a terribly old-fashioned name in France and I should at least be 80 to get away with it, butmy Dad liked it so I am named for an assortmend of long-dead French ladies like "Simone de Beauvoir" etc. Incidentally my Dad's likefor France didn't stop there, so he also named me 'Cecille' and 'Dominique'.   I was born on the 9th of November 1979 in Wuppertal, Germanyat 8.20 am. It was the last time in my life I got up early to do something!   Two months later my parents moved to Ommersheim, Germany, which is inthe Saarland. The Saar area briefly became more or less famous after the Great War but ever since has remained in obscurity- I intend to change that! Not that I am particularly patriotic but I like the idea that my being alone will help the place where I spent 18 years ofmy life to some sort of fame.   Like pretty much all children from that area I went to school (wow!), nothing strange there! But aged 18 my life changed rather drastically when I moved straight from my parents' house to London where I remained for the next four years, doing an assortment ofmore or less useful courses and degrees at the London School of Economics (LSE).   I now have a BA in Law and Anthropology, an MSc in Nationalism and Ethnicity and am doing my PhD in Anthropology. Mind you, in Brighton these days! However, part of the reason why I'm writing this- no, it's not only because I like talking about myself- is that I have to move to Frankfurt a.M. in Germany come October to do my fieldwork.   My research centres upon national identity and post-national citizenship amongst young Korean women in Germany. Why? Easy- my Mom (aka The Mother of all Philosophers) is Korean and I've always foundthe Korean Germanconnection interesting - and yes, I like talking about myself!   Mom or the Mother of all Philosophers hasn't given me any strange names but a lot of useful advice on life, the universe and everything. A much-loved and quoted classic is her early-morning phonecall to me one fine day to tell me that I should do sports in order to remain flexible. Why? Her reasoning was that I wouldn't stay single forever and therefore would need to be 'bendable' again at one point or another. I nevercould quite bring myself to ask her what exactly she envisaged me doing and maintain that I do not want to know!   What else does one need to know to understand any of these ramblings?   I think that's pretty much it. All else will either be self-explanatory or explained at appropriate points within the narrative!
