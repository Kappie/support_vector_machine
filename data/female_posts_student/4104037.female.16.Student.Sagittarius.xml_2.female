Also, I have another weblog on the internet but its somewhere else and my friends have access to it. Id like to see what happens to my writing and thoughts when I know that no one who I know will read it.       An introduction to me: Im going into 11th grade. I live in Rome. I go to an international school. I recently became optimistic and have no doubts other than society is pulling itself into a black hole, yet again, but whats new about that? What else is there to give in an introduction except for a few facts and thoughts. And that will be included in all the entries after this one. So the only thing special about this is that its the first time Im writing. But once again, whats so special? Why not jump right in.      A few moments later... Have you ever started thinking, and thought what are you thinking and youre trying to figure out what it was you were thinking before you started wondering about your thoughts? That just happened to me so now Im lost and am trying to freshen up my thoughts for complete strangers who will either take interest in my life or not. But beware: this is not my life. I love writing, but I dont care to write about my life. Other than a few basic points. Theres not much to write about, because I am happy.  And when youre happy youre carefree as your life goes. Id like to improve other peoples lives and the world, now that Ive improven my world and life. I found over the years that Im great at advise, esspecially if I was once in the same place. Then I can tell people how exactly I solved that problem for me, or just listen and give comfort. I dont want to be a psychologist though. After I read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath (which was amazing) I started seeing crazy people everywhere... I counted 5 in a week. Thats more than Ive ever seen in a year. It frightens me... Id rather not have other peoples lives in my hands. I just want to help my friends, because I know thet my friends have helped me become who I am.      I also helped MYSELF become who I am because you get no where depending on other people. But thats what a friend once told me, so now Im a bit confused. I guess it goes both ways. Theres no freedom in either solitude or dependence.      HEY! I love that, I think Ill write that down!!! Sometimes I cant believe the words I come up with. That could be concidered a 'quote'. How cool. I made up a quote. Haah.
