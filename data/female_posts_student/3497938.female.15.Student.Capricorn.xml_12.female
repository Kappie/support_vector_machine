(the 12) We stopped in Daytona and stayed for the night and then left Sunday morning for Cocoa Beach. We got there around 2, but couldnt check in until 4 so we messed around for a couple of hours. We got unpacked. Then went and walked around and checked out the place. Then came back and went to sleep. Monday we went swimming, and I met up with Mariah and she introduced me to Jeff. We (as in Me, Mariah, Kayla, and Jeff) went on the water slide and then Kayla decided to go lay out. So we did it again, like 3 more times. Then we (me, mariah, and jeff) went to the lazy river and talked and swam came over and said that i left her and she was goin up to the room to call her mom and rest. So, i said ok. I went up about an hour and a half later to get some food and get Kayla. And she was on the phone crying. I asked my grandma if I could go back down there. And she said yeah. So Kayla came back out and was depressed and upset which was bringin me down. We decided to go to Universal Tuesday and Thursday. She called her mom and her mom was coming to get her. We flew Amber out to Florida and went to pick her up Tuesday morning. Debra (kaylas mother) came and picked her up and they left, without telling my grandmother. It made my grandmother sooo mad and she called Debra to tell her that it was the wrong way to go about the situation. She hung up on my grandmother. Oh yeah, real mature. Like mother like daughter i guess. Kayla knew she was goin to be gone for a week. If she couldnt have handled it, she should have tunred down the offer and I could have taken someone else. It was rude of her and very immature and her mother isnt doin anything to help her by getting her out of something when she is upset. But whatever... I'll post more about the trip later on. My fingers hurt.
