They dont hurt that bad tho. But anyway.. I beleive at 5:30 i have a hair apointment. I know i'm getting a trim but my hair has some realllyyy bad roots that i'm trying to let grow out. My mom said maybe they could dye the ends that are like blonde, to match my natural color.. But i dont even know. I'll post after that's done with.
