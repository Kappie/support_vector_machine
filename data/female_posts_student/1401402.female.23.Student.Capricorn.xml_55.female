Aunties, uncles and lots and lots of cousins. Partly it's because the moment I'm in is so wonderful and densely packed with beauty that no other places can beat the fact that I'm happy.  Red White  Blue 07-04-03  It's fourth of July, a national holiday. YipeE!!! It all went well smoothly and I had some seriously delicious food and more precious conversation and quality time with families. I had beers and more beers. BBQ was great, there was ribs, steak kabobs, chickens, oysters, shrimps, corns and many more. I ate so much my belly looked like the sizes of Santa Claus beer belly.   Oh No...Did somebody say its karaoke time??? They played the top 20 songs from the 80's and 90's. Every song was "I KNOW THIS SONG. I LOVE THIS SONG!" I drank so much and sang my soul out. I was actually singing very amazingly or it could have been Sakdary getting drunk. LOL. The party was on until 12am, which was only 9pm my pacific standard time. No one can stop us now. That was one great night of my life.   An hour later we all decided to go to Atlantic City just for the heck of it. I missed out on the fireworks and that totally sucks. Walking around the broadwalk at 3 in the morning was really nice. I of course, get to play the slots for half and hour. Which wasn't too bad. I've spent $20.00 on slots. What I regret most was not buying any post cards damnit. Came home the next day.   Hot 07-06-03  It's hot like a mother f***** here. All we do here is eat and drink eat and drink. I'm growing a beer billy shit. Oh well, gotta go run and do my sit ups now.
