He is cross eyed in one eye, and he is the biggest coward you'll EVER meet. But he is also the sweetest, most adorable, loving creature you'll ever meet. He is more like a dog that way. Cuz cat's are usually bitches. Sam's other cat SMOKEY is suuuuuuch a bitch. And my cat shadow is also such a bitch. It's there nature to have such an attitude. But not KIT. When I used to come over here he would run away from me, and was scared, but not anymore. He will even lie on my face. But it sux cuz im allergic to cat's and so my eye's got all itchy and red and swollen, and my nose stuffy... but yah, cough. that's another story. But back to KIT. I think that he is not only beutiful because of his cuteness and the fact that he's extremely stunned, but he holds no judgments. He just loves you for who you are. people could learn a lot from KIT. which is kind of ironic, cuz he can't see straight. In order to focus, he has to sort of wiggle his head back and forth.. wow. i love him.  He is black and white. white paws, mostly black back. stomack that has white on it. and green crossed eyes.  Weellll that is it. Im gonna leave you now with that image. And when you die and have to decide what animal you wanna be reencarnated as.. choose to be a cat.    meow.
