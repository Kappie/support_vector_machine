Don't you think they would get the picture that we want them to go away.  I mean, we have fly swatters, made just for us to use on them.  And if you don't know me, you wouldn't know that I hate insects.  I am not a big "nature" girl.  Sure I used to go camping and stuff, but that's about all.  The last time my friends came over, we slept in the tent, and Jessica and I made Krystal get all the bugs out of the tent, we hid under the blankets.  So, just to re-cap, I HATE FLIES!!!    Roses are red Violets are blue Sugar is sweet But flies AREN'T!!!  That is all I have for today  Did you notice I posted twice in two days?   I'm almost as god as Heather!
