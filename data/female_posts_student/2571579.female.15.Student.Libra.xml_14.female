Then after work I walked around with some ppl and then I made them walk me through the short-cut to my house. Then Carissa came over and..I was laying on my counter laughing about this song we made up for a family haha .. wow Then we went to Bridge Street with Lynn. Me and carissa delivered wings to Steve and we chilled on his porch for a while. That was fun haha .. between throwing eachothers shoes on the road and catching fireflies haha .. ask for detailed stories. But now we're here and she's playing James Bond and in a little I might have to challenge her so wish me luck ;]  peace out-- kace
