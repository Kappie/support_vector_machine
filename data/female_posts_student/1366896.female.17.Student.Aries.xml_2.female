I think if I did not do this, no one would bother. I'm not being big-headed or egoistic, but look around and tell me if I'm right. People like chengsiew and sandra have to organise class outings and things like that. Perhaps that's the way we are. I mean, we all have a purpose being in this class, with the followers and leaders all alike. But to a certain extent, leaders do get tired of initiating all the time. I hope that some of you will also come forward to initiate things and organise stuff and try to get as many people to come. How's that? That's the way 4s2 will stay united and not let chengsiew down. Why her? I mention her because she's suffering from 4s2 withdrawal symptoms for almost 5 months now. She's the one who really felt the most towards our class, so let's do this for each other okay? :) I hope I have not offended anyone by saying this. I guess this is the only way to tell you guys how I feel, I'm sorry if I'm blunt or rash, but that's the way I am.   I'm fine with the going to Pasir Ris Theme park. It'll be interesting. I hope everyone who reads this or san's post will spread to our classmates okay? Spread it as best as you can, to whoever you meet, to sms-ing. Let's make this a good class outing, so that we all can come together to have fun okay? :) Besides, it's one day before school starts, and once school starts, you guys will be busybusybusy while I'll be shaking my legs at home. Haha, but I'm free if you wanna ask me out yes? Dinner anyone? Book NOW! -grins-   Anyway, I'm glad to see this blog moving somewhere. I've made everyone an admin, so access it as often as you want, as often as you can, to just blog about anything. No one is supposed to feel out as long as you still have us behind you ok? Take care people. I'll see you in a month's time. I really miss you guys alot. More than some of you think. Cheers. :P
