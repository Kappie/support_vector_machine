Awesome stuff...  I was supposed to have my lines memorized for the student-directed, one-act that I am in,  Actor's Nightmare , by Monday--well, if we were having school. So, I really need to get working on that.. I know them somewhat, but.. not good enough...  I had a dream today--I slept all day-- that it was the final performance, and I didn't know my lines... That was some scary stuff....
