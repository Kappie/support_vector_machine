I was just talking to Alex and she asked if Mark was short for something. And I was like "yeah, my dad's real name is Markington!" Not that funny, right? Well at lunch I found it soooo funny! I was laughing a ton! It was really weird. It was also weird in psychology today. We had a free day, and I was bored, so I was just quietly working. Chris Nugent walks up to me, and he says in a soft caring voice "Is everything ok, Erica?" and I was like "yeah, everything's fine" and he was like "Ok, you just had me wondering" It was really nice and funny. I didn't even think he knew my name. haha. Hmm...interesting stuff. I think Josh thought I liked Theran. haha. Good stuff. Oh well....doesn't matter. Hmm....well I'm running out of ideas to blog about, so I think I'll be going.
