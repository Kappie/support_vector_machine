Well, apparently you're supposed to go from Nebraska to Illinois, then to Kentucky, then to Tennessee. Well, we went from Nebraska to Kansas, then to Illinois, then to Kentucky, then to Tennesse. We arrived in Nashville at the church at like 10:45 or something. They had a sign out front that said "Welcome Redeemer Lutheran Youth". It was really cool. Then we had devotions and went to bed. G'Night.  Liz
