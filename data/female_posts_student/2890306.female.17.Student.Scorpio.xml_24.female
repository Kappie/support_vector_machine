Tomorrow looks to be busy.  First thing in the morning, I am scheduled to take the SAT at Washington.  That should last about 3 hours, then I have some "me" time.  A date with the mall is in order.  After that, I work from 6-9 P.M., and then babysit the rest of the night away.  The hypothesis is that Katie will be a pooped out girl at the end of the day.  (Did I just use 3rd person?  Kill me please.)  Geoff's grandparents are in town, and I am so excited to see them!  We are having brunch after I get off work on Sunday.  So kind of them to plan events around me, isn't it?  Makes me feel like part of the family.  *warm fuzzie feelings*  I think we're going to Royal Fork...yum.  One of my favorites.  If you're looking for an interesting event in this blog post, don't worry... I shan't disappoint you.    *hazy dream sequence, complete with fog and eerie music, begins*  It all began in American History class, 6th period.  This senior (obviously destined for a life of cigarettes and gambling, if you know what I mean) was talking trash about cheerleaders in general, saying random bad things that really weren't necessary.  We'll call her Mary.  Anyway, Mary just wanted attention, and sadly, was getting it.  Either oblivious to the fact we have a couple cheerleaders in class or indifferent to it, she was expressing herself quite loudly.  Finally, one of the girls said, "Well, at least we're out on the court, trying our best."  You can imagine how Mary reacted to that.  She got quite huffy and then sat in the corner brooding.    (I forgot to mention we had a substitute teacher today, being that Mr. Kuehn went home sick.  This substitute teacher might as well have been absent, for his class "control" mirrored if this had been so.)  Anyway, Mary went over to the substitute teacher and began complaining how people were pissing her off and yada yada.  Another girl in my class said Mary had anger management problems, and consequently, Mary called her "a stupid bi***."  How incredibly classy, I know.  It gets better.  Then, a boy said told Mary to calm down and Mary smacked him across the face.  Hard.  This Mary is the kind of girl you fear, the butchy one that you know would be able to find your house in complete darkness, sneak into your room, and beat you to an unrecognizable pulp.  Maybe this is the reason our substitute teacher did nothing about it the entire time.   Reason #2335 to love the public school system brought to you by Katie's Daily Muffin.   Good story, eh?  Well, I don't know if my words did it justice.  You had to be there.  Anyway, I leave you tonight with a fortune:     ...in bed.
