ANGER   FRUSTRATION   CONFUSION   DEPRESSION   TIREDNESS      PEOPLE WHO SAY LOL I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE AM SPEAKING TO ONE OF YOU AT THE MOMENT STOP IT GROW A BRAIN GET A VOCABULARY AAAAAAAARGH.      /one rant down, just 1 million 9 hundred and 99 to go...      Right.      Parents... DRIVING ME MAD AUSSI. They are crazy ... or rather, *normal* argh. And very very very annoying and are upsetting me why why would they do that o yes tis their life hobby /draws breath tries 2 calm down fails miserably      Several other things are adding to my frustration and confusion. Many awkward situations, much not knowing where i stand and much interference. Craziness. Tom Mom has signed in joy of joys *that* should help, not. another loller, and a confusing one at that.
