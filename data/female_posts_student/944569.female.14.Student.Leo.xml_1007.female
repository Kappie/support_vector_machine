I feel stupid, typing an important part of my friend's life while dressed in a rudely made little Uchiha Sasuke costume.  Not exactly what i pictured it to be... I want to find the essence of this speech.  i want something that will move people and that will make them laugh.  I want something that will show all our silly jokes in the past.  I want everyone to laugh with us as we did laugh until we fell on the floor, clutching our sides with our bellies aching and cheeks hurting but as happy as a newborn foal.  A foal that is so exciting about life that withing a few hours, gets up and explores the world, new scents, feelings and wonders...
