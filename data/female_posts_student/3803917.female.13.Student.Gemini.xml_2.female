Well, Mediocre.      I went with my dad, step-mum, s-m's friend, s-m's friend son (who has long hair ^^)      I had a bad feeling on the way there. All I could see, as far as my eye would look was CHAVS. Small chavs, Big chavs, short chavs, tall chavs. etc. etc.      There was a group tent, (which looked best) an urban tent, AKA chav tent, and an open air stage, where we settled.    First there was a bad replica band doing old songs, and then they went off and a band called "Stateside Hombres" came on (who have toured with _James Brown_. Wow. I am so amazed. Yet sarcastic at the same time), a ska band.       My definition -     Ska- n - a type of music similar to rap in which the members must say the group name, "ska", or repeat a word several times during their "song". Only enjoyed in small doses.       Dictionary's definition -     Ska- n - A type of Jamaican music similar to reggae.      They were Ok. But they made my feet vibrate >   As soon as they were on the whole bloody festival flocked over! My dad hated it though. Plus I could hear the chav tent music.       Boom boom yeah woo respect! MC Slide boom yeah boom woooh!       Yuk.      Anyway, that was that.I had a wet bottom and had consumed several cans of coke.      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      I missed the activity day. I have tonsillitus (again) forabout the 4/5 time.   Mmm. More antibiotics.      Round Chelsey's on Friday. yayayayay!      Come back you minion. Comment!      Baaaa *cough* aaaa.      *tonsil falls out* Ew.    I have to have more teeth out. Crap crap crap crap. They won't give me general anaesthetic. If I want it I have to go to Wales and pay 200 quid. Or gas and air. Or injections again. *shudder* That will be 7 out in preparation for this stupid brace. I don't care if I get a cystic infection.    Moo....   -----------------------------------------------------------------      Well, at least I bothered to show up for the last day. I have tonsillitus for god's sake and half the class couldn't be assed. "On holiday" they say. Yeahh. Of course.      And you Hannah. Even if you are "knackered". No antibiotics for you. *takes them away*.         Lucy   xx
