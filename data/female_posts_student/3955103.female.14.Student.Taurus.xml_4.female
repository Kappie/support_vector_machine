Made me happy since it was only my second real kiss.  Anyways, I have yet to break the news with Candace, I'm sooooo way excited I can't wait to tell her!! I think I'm going to call her right now.     Anyways, I think I'm going to go so I can call her. Otherwise I get mucho confused and I can't multi-task. Just doesn't work for somebody like me. So yeah. Chat ya up later.
