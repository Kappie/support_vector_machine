I think I'm back to using this journal because they freakin' erased my other one on Open Diary for not logging in after three months...I haven't logged in here after almost two years, so what the f**k? Anyway, wow, reading my old entries has shown me that so much has changed! I am living in Los Angeles now. I am working as a paralegal and waiting out this year before law school. I'm so hung up on someone else (who is now my ex, someone I met in DC when I interned there) that it's disgusting, but I'm still trying to negotiate my own way in life. I'm not as happy as the last time I wrote, but I feel more free and independent than ever.
