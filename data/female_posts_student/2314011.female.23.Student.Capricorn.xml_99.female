It was that great mix of phantom headache, teasing cramps, iffy-stomach and equal parts vulnerability/fragility and irritability/ambivalence.  Couldn't even get beyond half a morning page before having to head back to the couch to charge up for the shower challenge.  It was a worry, let me tell you!  Resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to skip yoga and spend the evening on the couch feeling hormonal.  Upon my return this afternoon, however, I found the possible source of my troubles:  the apartment was fucking hot.  I love Spring on the Palouse.  I really do.  But it's schizophrenic nature can be a bitch when it comes to adjusting the thermostat.    At any rate, this was not the mood in which I wished to chat with former (and sometimes formidably intimidating) boss Jodi about the terms of my summer employment back at the UI Library.  But the gorgeous, 50+ degree weather helped a lot, what with the fresh air, bright shining sun and skip trying desperately to return to my step and all.  She was on a break, of course, by the time I made it to the 4th floor; a 15-minute one, supposedly.  45 minutes and a thorough catch-up session with my favorite geezer, Cort, later, boss-lady and I sat down to work out the details.  I was strong.  I wasn't going to budge.  I was taking August off and she'd better not screw me too much on my return-pay.  Jodi's a bit notorious for that kind of thing, so I was expecting a haggling-session just to get to $7/hour; down $0.30 from when I left last August.    "So when do you think you'd start?"  she started, simply enough.  "Probably right after school's over; second or third week in May."  "And you're planning on working the whole time?"  "Pretty much; I'd like to take a few weeks off near the end of the summer to visit the fam and all, but that would be pretty much it."   If that's okay with you, I mean, I don't HAVE to see my family.  Just tell me; whatever you think is best.   "Okay, well, we've got this project ..."  ---Insert various project descriptions, all in friendly, cheerful, amiable nature here.----  "So really, there's enough work for you if you want the full 40 hours, or if you only want 30, that's fine too.  These aren't that pressing, they just need some regular attention."  "Well, there  is  this world-saving, humanity-enriching venture I wanted to check out after school's done, but that shouldn't take too much time."  "Okay, just let me know what happens.  And if you get another part-time gig, that's fine too.  These hours are really flexible."   WHO THE HELL ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE BITTER, CROCHETY, JEALOUS SHELL OF A WOMAN I USED TO WORK FOR!  At least I knew where I STOOD with her!   "Now, you were making $7.30 when you left, right?"  "Right."   Now it's on.  (Mentally rolling up the sleeves, sliding the lawyer-to-be facade into place.)  "Okay, well, as I told you before, the budget's been really tough lately.  They gave us a bit more money for student workers this year, but that will run out at the end of the fiscal year.  Sooo, hmmm....yea...I can probably only pay you about $8 or $8.50."  (Putting eyes back in my head and trying pass that huge gasp off as a cough)  "That's fine..."   did that sound like a squeak?!   Yea, that's right!  Try to fuck with ME, will you?!  Guess I showed  HER  who's the  real  boss!    Epilogue:  The early yoga class was spectacular, as has been an evening of homework, laundry, pleadings from a spicy number to join her for San Fransisco Pride and Thursday night TV.
