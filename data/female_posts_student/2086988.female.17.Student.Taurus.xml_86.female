The first night we met as we kissed in the rain to the last time we were together, standing outside his dorm, holding on to one another, neither of us not wanting to let go. I just wanted to stay in this moment forever. On Sunday night, it was I think one of the best times. It was so cute, just messing with each other and joking around. All that was going through my head was not wanting tomorrow to come. Which then reminded of the Garth Brooks song, "If Tomorrow Never Comes", because then I wouldn't have to leave...Walking away this morning was so hard. But I knew that if I had looked back I wouldn't of been able to leave.    If tomorrow never comes...
