I've been helping my grandma with my grandfather a lot lately, have had really stupid rehearsals for nothing at my old church and haven't been able to spend time with most of my friends (except megan) this week.  Mike comes home early this weekend, I'm very happy. I got a wonderful phone call this afternoon about the spawns of satan that he takes care of. Poor kid.  Wow, I'm talking to Tony, a really old friend from Norfolk Christian. His cousin just recently died in Iraq and he went to the funeral today. Please keep him and his family in your prayers.  Well kids, It's getting on the late side and I'm slowly wilting.   Good night.  -Allison
