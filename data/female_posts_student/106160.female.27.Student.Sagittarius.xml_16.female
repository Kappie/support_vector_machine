I woke up early and logged onto  urlLink VZ  to try and play bingo for the event prizes...didn't win but a super nice person heard me say I collected teacups there and gave me 2 of the event ones (they're red). Went to my sister's house for family lunch which was quite yummy and gorged myself on fresh pineapple and new potato salad (I normally  hate  potato salad but this kind w/new potatoes that my mom does is so yummy). Came home with a new family member (pictures  a name forthcoming)! Went to view the fireworks at the park and got a great parking spot that was quite close up...very ooh and ahh worthy, especially to Andy. Speaking of teh monkey...he'll be 5 this Thursday (8th). My lil man is growing up! *sniff* XD And Happy Independence Day to my fellow Americans (lol).  Off to watch a movie  then to Denny's (yes, the one 30 min. away in Commerce ^^;;)...I think we might go see the Harry Potter or Spiderman 2 movie tomorrow after lunch at the Chinese buffet since I don't have classes.
