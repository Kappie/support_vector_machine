Alas, Twan has called out today, which is a little aggrivating.  He has extenuating family issues, but I think he is prolly just gonna sleep all day.  If he called out tomorrow, it wouldn't be so bad, but today's lunch meeting is what will be the worst.  The other 2 I can handle no problem.  I guess I should becareful going around saying "oh I don't mind the stress, I work best under pressure..."  Onto the okay stuff.  Yesterday I became  urlLink Hester Prynne  for a brief moment in time.  I ended up working it all out and it turns out that I was the only person who acutally got in trouble for anything, but I realized a) I haven't done anything wrong, so I'm in the clear, b) anyone in my position would have been treated the same by this person and c) I don't really give 2 shits what the person who's mad at me thinks as they've not got a leg to stand on as far as their argument goes.  So yesterday at Kickboxing class I really went into "grudge-match" mode as Cory would say.  I pretented to punch and kick and double kick this person in their woochata so much that it broke open like a pinata spilling its contents on the floor.    In light of all of the drama of yesterday certain situations have become a little less stressful/akward so thats kind of cool.  A non dramatic  urlLink Ruckus  can be brought and everything will become "ruckusified" and thats cool.  For the record:  urlLink Bex  makes rockin' chocolate chip cookies.  Not only is she a master pup tent builder, but she's a cookie chef extrordinaire.  Underworld is a pretty kick ass movie and certain people are just as klutzy as me.  Its funny.  Finally, when  urlLink something  in your life is stressful and you're sick of talking yourself in circles about it and people start running their mouths too much, its delightful to employ the use of this delightful feature AIM has called 'block'....it truly makes life great.    That about does it for this entry.  Make sure to check back on the 16th for my 1 Year Blogaversary and my State of the Diva Address.  Catch ya on the flipside, childrens.
