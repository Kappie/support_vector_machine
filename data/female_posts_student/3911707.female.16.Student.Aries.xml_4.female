So she says I can't go to Redgranite, and I said that was fine because we wanted to go to Green Lake instead. She said we'd talk about it in the morning. Excuse me miss, we want to leave in the morning. If she says no, she'll have one cranky girl on her hands. Man, she's such a bitch to me. She trys so hard to control my life, even when I'm at my dad's house. My dad just knocked on my door and said my mother called him. He asked what my plans were and I said we changed them and wanted to go to Green Lake. End of story. Why can't my mom be as cool as him? I wont be posting anything for awhile, my dad's going to Rock Fest this weekend, so I'm at my mom's until Sunday. I'm preparing for hell.
