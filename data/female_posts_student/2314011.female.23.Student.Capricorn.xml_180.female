And the only appropriate maiden picture was the Infamous White Board of 1428: The Den of the Stellar Super Students.  Each exam had its own rallying cry, drawn from its respective study sessions.  The surrounding quotes were faves over the two weeks, but didn't quite reach the level of exam-theme, if you will.  So there ya have it.  Suppose I could post a key for all those non-Stellar Super Student readers:  "Strawman!" = Property flashcards session at 1428.  Emily was all over the red flags hidden in the fact patters.    "Eyes on the Prize!" = Contracts food-run to Tideymans.  Emily and I had to focus ourselves on our breaks to ensure our continued studying once we returned from the store.  "Hello, bullets!" = Criminal Law flashcards at the Eastside Marketplace.  Emily found the disorganized meshing of multiple factors to consider troublesome while Calamity Jane and I pictured a shoot-out in the card's fact pattern.  "Sharon!!" = Civil Procedure flashcards at 1428.  The first study session with the new hair do was to be the one during which I finally received a nickname.  We couldn't remember who the other twin was from The Parent Trap, but Emily reminded us shortly as we dug through our Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, shrieking out:  "Sharon!"  The extra exclamation point was added after the name evolved into an Ozzy Ozborne impression.  "25.5 for 130." = Torts study session at the Grind.  Emily reminded us that we had 25.5 hours in which to study for a 130 minute exam.    And that's how it really happened.    Have more to post later, involving another big gay milestone with Mom this morning, but it deserves its own post and I deserve a bit of mindless Summer Blockbuster entertainment, so I'm off to see "The Day After Tomorrow."  Look out Global Warming.
