I need a red-light pen, though, to help my eyes adjust so I can see the stars better.  So I saw Vega (easiest star to spot lately...), Draco (Drako? whatever.), and all the easy-amateur ones. Quite beautiful, its been so clear lately.  For *some* reason, I have been thinking a lot on what Ashley said, and I realize it's never gonna happen. As much as I love Zach, it can't be more than a friendship (and he knows it, too). Even if she thinks we should be together. Hah. I hope he's having fun working at the golf course, with the sanitation problem they've been having (you can smell it from the library).  Ok, so, my brother's trial is tomorrow. Hopefully he does well, and they dismiss it, but I doubt they will. Stupid ass. How he could get caught with that thing in his hand, when he says he didn't make it...what a loser. Also, his lawyer makes $200 an hour, which is big money around here for a lawyer (she's the best in the area).  Who else is totally disgusted by the fact that Colin Farrel is a father? Poor children. Feel worst for them than I do Michael Jackson's kids...
