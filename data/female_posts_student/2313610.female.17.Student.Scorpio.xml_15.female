Catch it, tie it up and play boy band songs to it until is has no more willpower of self confidence left."  Oh man. I'm so glad this week is finally over, and that I finally have a moment or two to breathe. For the past month or so, I've been arguing with a guy so much that I was stressed out of my mind, and he wouldn't leave me alone. He just kept attacking, trying to prove that he was the victim in all this, while he stabbed and twisted the knife. This post will undoubtedly cause more trouble between us when her reads it. Fuck that though. I'm so sick of it. Self centered bastard.  I need space! Thank any deity that he's leaving for camp and that I can have it for a few weeks. Maybe actually be able to talk to my friends with out him throwing a fit. Maybe be able to study acdec without him whining that I'm not paying enough attention to him. As though he's the center of my universe when he lives 3000 miles from me! If I had a boyfriend I swear he would explode.  Yah, ok, enough male bitching... I GOT THE SASSER VIRUS!!!! I got it Monday night! Called Dell three times that night, trying to get help. No use. They outsourced to India, so their service sucks ass. I can't believe how bad it was. I was hysterical by the end of the night. Above mentioned boy calling did not help matters.   Called my Dad the next morning. He made me do shit then restart me entire system. FROM SCRATCH! He yelled at me for whining too. I was so stressed out though! You would be hysterical too if this happened and no one was there to help you. I called dell again. Got more fucked up. My mom's new computer then came and I spent the rest of the day setting it up and making it work. It was relaxing to actually see things work.  My "love" came over on Wednesday, and it was a welcome distraction from the damn laptop, which I didn't bother with. The modem I could not get to work and I wasn't in the mood to get more Frustrated. We studied Acdec, and watched the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged. Funniest thing I think I have ever seen. Good stress relief.  Thursday I tried my hand at Dell one last time. COMPLETELY USELESS! Bitch would not let me send my Laptop in and then proceeded to make me do things I've already done, as though I'm some Neophyte, then download modem software from the other computer, use one of my CD's to burn it, and it didn't work! Called my Dad again and he hung up on me because I was practically in hysterics. It was a hard week! Jesus fucking Christ! That man is an asshole. I go to take a shower before I kill something and my mom then yells at him, telling him how hard this week has been for me. So he calls back and tells me to buy a modem card, which he'll pay for. FINALLY! Something! Then I have to deal with my Mom screaming at me because of the dishes... As though I wasn't stressed out enough with out the fucking temper tantrums.  Friday: Set up psycho bitch Grandma computer and listened to rampid Spanish. It's fun to listen to people when they think you don't understand them. Heh... Then we went to CompUSA and Best Buy and tried to get the fucking modem card, despite my dad being the most useless limp dick in the world, accusing the poor help guy of being incompetent when he was the only one who was helping me! He said if the sales guy was wrong he'd come out himself and tear out his nuts through his throat. Told him that it'd be amazing that he'd come out at all. Got hung up again. Went home, took forever to get damn modem to work. It throws tantrums too. I eventually got it to work though. I was then left alone. Started cleaning... Best thing for my frayed nerves. I called a friend, and she came and kept me company. It's fun cleaning with friends. Then we went out and got food. More fun, going down dark overton at high speeds.... eep... But we lived.   Over all it's been the week from hell. At least tomorrow the comcast guy comes and makes the internet fast. Also I'm just glad the week is over tomorrow. Maybe next week will be less stressful.  Faylinn out.
