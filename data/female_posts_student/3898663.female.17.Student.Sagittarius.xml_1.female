I entered a contest the other day....at 2424milk.com, where you enter the UPC of milk products and are entered to win a Volkswagon bug convertable...they are giving one away once a day for 24 days. I thought it would be cool to have one, and you don't have to do anything but drink milk and pretend to care to be entered, so I'm game. I do so hope I win a car, I would be quite happy.  In other news, after this weekend I don't have to go back to work for about 11 days or so, which will be quite nice because I will be clinging to Mathew with all that I have absolutly begging him not to leave to no avail, but I will still but on a good show. That, and I get to go to the fair, a pathetic event in which the prices are far too high, the rides to lame, and far too many gross people call fun....It shall be a blast, because I get to be with friends, and that will be fun.  My sister-in-law leaves for Japan on Monday to be with my idiot brother....Halfway across the world is a good place for him, I don't like him at all, and the chance of him coming home, even on a semi-regular basis is now null and void, my life is almost completely perfect, now if only I could get rid of his demonic father, life as I know it would be grand...  As for now, I shall commence making cooking and thinking about my darling Mathew, oh how I long for his return. I love you Mathew, my darling. I will always love you, with all my heart.  Fucking Kangaroos.... *scribbles them out*  Ciao~
