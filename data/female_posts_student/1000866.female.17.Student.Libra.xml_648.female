I told myself I wouldn't cry but, I definitely did cry a little at the end of the day. Oh well. I'll get to hang out with some of them this summer hopefully.   I got my final back for psych. YES! I have an A in the class. Ohh yeah! Whoo! Hah. That made me happy obviously.   So, okay...senior prank story, which had the potential to be really funny but...ended up being sort of a flop. The seniors planted a tree in the middle of the football field which, is quite funny. Then, at the beginning of fourth hour (thnk you seniors, I didn't have my French homework done) someone pulled the fire alarm. So, we all go outside and I think the plan was that we would all go outside and see the tree. However, they removed it this morning. No good. THEN, we all started to feel these little droplets of rain and we're all like, "uh oh." So, A. the tree wasn't even there and, B. the seniors themselves got wet from the rain when they were all nicely dressed up. :( Poor seniors. What a bummer of a prank.   Anyway, I'm going to go now. I have to do my math packet for Danbom's class. Ugh.
