Unable to stop myself, I ran over on my little stubby cow legs, and started chewing.  "You'll start to enjoy being a cow. Just imagine how wonderful the children will be. You'll see." She said.  I have to admit, being a cow isn't so bad. Even being married to an alien cow hybrid isn't bad.   At least the kids are cute. Didn't I tell you about the kids? Well I can't mention all of them. There are over 200 of them. Let's just say the wife and I were rather busy.  So now, I must leave you all, and continue to enjoy my cow filled days aboard this star ship.  Didn't tell you about that one either? I must be slipping in my old age. I'm about 3000 years young. Of course, I'm immortal.  So, without me ending this, it would go on forever. I'm sorry, but I'm quite tired of looking at you people. Goodbye.  (And so ends Bob the Builder that went awry!  Hal will be along with another story shortly. After that, Katie gets a turn to start one. I have no idea what we'll do after  that , so stay tuned!)
