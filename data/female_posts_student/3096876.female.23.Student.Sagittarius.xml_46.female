And she's among the last of her friends to turn 19, of those young'uns that don't have a fake I.D., of course.   My Mom had me go to the mall last night to get her some gift certificates and a little something special. She had no idea what to get Ally, but I figured it would be most practical to get her something that she can wear out on Sunday night.Usually, shopping is totally my forte, but whenever it's shopping for Ally I'm lost. Her tastes are so...diverse. On the one hand, she's big into sweats and big-Ts. On the other hand, she goes out wearing halters and tube-tops--stuff I've NEVER had the courage to wear! I got her this really cute sheer top with big, thick black  white stripes and a little beaded flower on the shoulder.   I pulled it out when I got home and my Dad was like "You can see right through that. Oh, she can't wear that out."  Yes she can, Dad .  Mom: "I still don't understand why she's got it in her head that she HAS to go out, and why does she have to go and get studpid drunk?"  Mom, you only turn 19 once. Jeepers! You'd think like she's getting a tattoo and not just going out for a few drinks with her friends!   It's crazy to think about Ally being 19. I've still got it stuck in my head that she's only 14, just a little punk kid stealing my clothes and driving me nuts. But she's no kid anymore. She's a young lady. She'll be going to college soon, after that doing the same thing I'm doing: just trying to figure out where she'll fit in, in an adult world. She's a supervisor at her job now, a promotion she got after being there for only a year. Sure, it's just KFC, but I'm damn proud of her. It's giving her a real sense of responsibility that I don't think she's getting at home. I guess it was the same for people watching me grow up, 'cause I'm just marvelling at Ally. Some of the things that she says when we talk just astound me. I can take advice from her and trust it--she's going through the same things that I have, and she's learning some really valuable lessons.  And now she's 19. She's gonna have a bit of a tough time getting into a bar without a driver's license, but I suppose she'll just have to make do.  I'm really excited for her, and on top of that, I'm really excited that now she can come and hang out with me and my friends. I've extended the invitation to her, so I hope that she takes it. I'd love to bring her out with me sometime when I'm going out to a bar. I think she'd have a lot of fun hanging out with big sis, and I think I'd have a lot of fun hanging out with little sis.   It's possible that she stays with that craphead of a loser "boyfriend"  (who she's still not admitting to still seeing, forget that I found them both asleep on the couchin the basement this morning...)  because she's got nowhere else to go. I think that if she sees how much fun she can have without him, she might not feel so attached...   It seems like sucha parallel to what happened with Brent. Mona said it best: it seemed like whenever I talked about having fun, it was when I was going out without him. You're so smart Mona. Do me a favour? The next time I bitch to you about something, and you offer me some of your sage advice, can you also include the line   "Do what I say because I'm smarter than you"   ? I'd really appreciate the reminder.
