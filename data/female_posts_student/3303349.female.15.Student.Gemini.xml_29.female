It is in this moment how much a part of me he has become and how truely alone I feel right now knowing that I won''t be able  to talk to him all the time. I am going to miss him unimaginably much. I love him. Now is when my feelings really begin to materialize. Love, lonelyness and sadness. I really have a deep bond with Paul, my boyfriend and the person I love. A good thing that I only miss, sadly, when it is gone.
