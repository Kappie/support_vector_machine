M  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  s  ' reactions were simply priceless... maybe I'm evul, but I can't help laughing out loud...       The other day [the performance was held, in which I played the song way earlier than I as supposed to], I was walking alongside to my Jie, looking down from the second floor once in a while... then I spotted one of the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s . How I got to know the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  is still kinda like a mystery to me still... Anyway, the elder of the  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  was walking towards his classroom, unaware that I was looking down at him. My Jie was sure to have known that I had seen him, and yet, she did not expect what came next...      ..."[name of elder  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r ]!" I shouted, and I ducked so that he could see no one other than Jie. She was so paiseh that she laughed... LoL... Then she came after me... Haha, my cute Jie~      That was the first incident which involved the elder brother... no big deal, after all, it  was  still within the school grounds and school hours...      But today, I went to celebrate my birthday at The Cafe' Cartel or something with  m  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  s . We ate many things, pasta and pizza and stuff, and I ate a cake while the other 3 of my friends ate ice-cream. Straight after, my Jie and another indian friend left the restaurant, leaving the both of us [me and my other friend] inside. Later we saw her again, but that's not important anywayz...       M  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  and I went to Tampinese Mall, got off bus no. 10 and walked on..........until McDonalds, which isn't very far from the bus interchange. I wasn't paying much attention to the surrounding area and was just talking on and on about the younger of the two  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r  s  [I DID NOT start the conversation...well, I don't think so] when my friend suddenly pointed to my left. A guy in a Temasek Dragon House T-shirt was walking the opposite direction of where I was going. It was the person I was talking on and on about... Coincidence? (dumb luck?)... There was only one thing to do...........................................................      ................................."[name of younger  Y  e   b  r  o  t  h  e  r ]!".......................Then I ran ahead, leaving him to turn around, searching for the source of the voice which called him... and there  m  y   f  r  i  e  n  d  was, just waving her hand at him and saying "hi"... I guess she couldn't think of much to say then...   But I still can't really believe the piece of luck I had... Meeting him there... I don't go there often and neither does he, and yet, we passed each other, I saw him and I  think  he saw me...        Well, that's about all that happened... So... er...
