Happiness is precious, I should stop being paranoid waiting for the next thing to toddle by and steal it away.  Have my exam booked with GMC for Monday at 10:00 which means.. mwah.. i get to miss school..... to write an exam.... i'm not sure if thats such a good trade off. I came home after my double math period today and have decided to boycott school. I'm not going back... at least for today, so I'm skipping English.  Came home to Andrew still asleep in bed (Dad called him in sick so that he wouldn't have to face his Nazi band teacher after skipping his last band concert... WHAT about me!?) ... which sucks because I like having afternoons to myself but at the same time is good because I forgot my keys and he was there to let me in!  I don't know if I have anything else of interest to share... Mark and I are talking again which is err good?..... or just damn confusing.... I blame Rob..  Yea.. you hear that Rob.. I blame you... hehe.. as always.. ya know I love ya...  I getta see Kev and Allie again this weekend, so hooray.... if Kev can sit still long enough to hold a conversation with me and Allie isn't complainin over bein sick...  In reflection I just realized most of my friends are getting married.. or are married... having children.. or already have children oooor hah.. are having more children... I feel so left out.... (NO that does NOT mean i want to get married or have children!!! hah.. just making an observation here!!)  Nothing really deep to comment about that... sooo whatever... here's to boring old Fridays when its rainy and sucky and I getta go shopping with my Daddy -lol-... yes.... fun fun..
