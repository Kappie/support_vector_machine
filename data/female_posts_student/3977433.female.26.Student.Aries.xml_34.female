I guess mostly just enjoyed my own company.      Not sure what I'm doing tonight. Probably a lot of thinking. ...of what other people are doing at this moment. I know one thing. I won't get caught up in any drama. I'll keep my distance until I know for sure I won't get hurt again.       I should take a nap with my boys. I have many thoughts, but probably nothing I'd share in this blog.      I hope everyone has a great night.
