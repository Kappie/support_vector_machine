The AP english test is all over and done with.  Haha...I think I did really bad.  My last essay was so horrible, after the first 2 i just couldn't think anymore and wrote a bunch of shit that didn't make sense.  We got to choose our own topic for the persuasive essay...I chose gay marriage, and I think I did pretty well, we'll see. I need to go take a nap. I'm tired.
