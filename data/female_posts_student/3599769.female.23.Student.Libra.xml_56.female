Tonight is no different than any other except that his schedule does not permit him to have a Friday nite off like tonight. So therefore in my head he will be doing fun things with another Girl.  I know that I am crazy and today only magnifies my craziness. I've even planned there outing for them. I don't think I'm gonna make it through the night. Why do I do this to myself? Even though I know that it doesn't necessarily need to be a Friday for him to take a girl out but what better night than tonight. I haven't talked to him since the episode on Tuesday.  Oh, God or Timmy whoever can answer prayers faster, PLEASE, PLEASE let him see the errors in his ways. Okay, okay a little dramatic and maybe there not all his errors. But dammit, I 'm willing to give it another shot. (no surprise)  HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE. I realize that, but it doesn't seem to make things on my end any better. I wish I was addicted to something else besides him. I know I sound pathetic, I just couldn't help blogging once more on why my life is shit.  Self- pity session ends now.  "Nobody loves you when your 23...."  Okay now.
