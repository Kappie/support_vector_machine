Other than that my mom is taking my brother to a movie..and she says " I never spend time with him..." which I find hilarious because the last time we had a girl's day out was like before my little brother, Jack (4), was born. But, what can you do?..You can do nothing.... So, after deciding that I don't feel like going to see the Day After Tomorrow....I sat down a thought " I'm going to start blogging..." and by golly...I created an account at, who would ever guess, www.blogger.com, and now I'm writing to no one....this will sit on the internet and no one but me will ever read it except for the few people around the world that may run into my blogging entries. I might tell some people... I'm kind of hungry and can't decide whether or not to fix a grilled cheese sandwich ( sp?) or a quesadilla..(sp?) But, it's all good... I think I'm done...this is enough for today...if I don't forget that I have created a blogging account than I will publish another tomorrow, if I forget just remember this as the day that I take over the blogging website.. Ok, I really gotta go... Luv Everyone...even the sickest of people ( MJ )  It's not a big love for MJ but it's enough to call him "loved" Remember, Christ First ! Love ....Lauren
