Anyway I wasn't going against my better judgment call me at nite...3646110... and it'll be ok but I usually don't get in until around 12...that's 11 for you so yea. Leave a msg though. Ask linds to call if she wants to talk. How's becca? Will is in CO right now and he's pissed and you guessed it..phil. Becca told him what phil said when he called her a spoiled brat and "can be repalced easily" and he's furious. So I think she's repressing something about what she really feels about what phil said that nite. I'm not happy with what he said but she should also know that she asked for the true and open feelings and he gave it to her. You would know if she's truly ok. I don't want another shocker from her or for her to get out of shock when I get back or... basically I want her happy. you know infront of me she's going to put on a face that says everything is alright. One of the things that phil did that nite beside yell at her was to make her feel guilty. If we didn't date because of her she would feel extra guilty because right now she thinks that what phil really wants is me...We'll discuss that later...that's a whole different argument for another day. Anyway she actually told me that she would hate me if I hurt him...yea right. Take care fo yourself for me k? You know I would have bubble wrapped you before I left if didn't know you wold have killed me...after you popped it all. Just take care, hug yourself for me everyday and hug linds for me too. Tell will that I'm not a blind twit when it comes to phil and that no matter what I love him too. Linds... just bubble wrap her with a peguino in it...then let her out after she has popped. Hug becca and tell her that Phil loves her daily...actually space it out because she doesn't like that name right now. Josh, you know how I feel about cheating and how much right now that Phil could hurt me. I also know that you know that becca wants to become closer to phil right now and not really with me. If anything happens btwn them two, lemme know. Don't worry I'm not going to run home and go on a completely rampage, honestly deep down I would be extremely hurt and grateful that the thing has ended. I just want a heads up so I don't come home and break down. I love you!!! take care. byebye
