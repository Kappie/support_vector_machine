I came homeat 1:30ish (yes, in the morning) and I was just way  too tired  to take the time and post. So let me start off with yesterday. I woke up @ 8 am once again but yesterday I had such a hard time getting up. I had @ least 5 and a half hours of sleep which was more thanMonday night. But got up, ate breakfast, got ready, went to Kevin's, and then went to my grandpa's. My grandpa seemed better yesterday than Tuesday so that's good. I'm still worried but I mean when haven't I been worried about him? I kinda fell asleep on my grandpa's couch watching the news for an hour or so. But I woke up just in time to watch the  WHOLE hour  of the Price is Right... Ironic huh? Then I went outside and hung with my grandpa. Eddie and Kevin told me how my uncle was busy  re -priming what they already primed... Does that make sense to any of you? Yeah, it didn't make much sense to me. My grandpa needed new stakes for the tomato plants in the garden so Eddie, my mom, and Kevin took my baby (my grandpa's car that will be mine) to Home Depot or wherever to get 'em and I just read my magazine and talked with my grandpa while they were gone. When they came back, it was so funny. My uncle was being so stupid. He couldn't even get the stakes out of the trunk! Hello, wasn't rocket science!If you can't tell, I don't like him very much. And I have plenty of reasons but those are more personal and family related than I'd like to share. So then my uncle ordered pizza. Is it bad that I had McDonald's onTuesday and pizza on Wednesday?  And does pizza count as fast food?  I had three pieces. Eddie had like  6  and Kevin had  8  I think. A little after that we left. We got there at like 9 am and stayed til 3 pm so don't think I was only there for an hour! I love my grandpa more than that!! Then we had to drop off Kevin andgo to the store. It was crazy. I looked terrible because I fell asleep on the couch and Eddie was covered in paint. And his shirt was ripped so people were probably wondering about us. I finally got home @ 4ish. It was the first time I was home all day. But I had to clean, do crunches, water flowers, get ready for soccer, get ready for going out afterwards... So at around 6:30, I left for soccer. Yesterday at soccer I just felt so moody. Like I was getting mad at Nicole for not even trying while passing the ball. I mean it was fucking passing not something difficult. And then we did our usual drills for Wednesday practices. I was proud of myself for that time because they weren't as hard (breathing wise) as the other times. But then we began to scrimmage. I was actually picked before Nicole for once and even before a bunch of boys!! I felt good about that. But then there's the little voice in my head.  It keeps telling me, "Why are you trying? You're not even good. Look at how much the other boys beat you. It was your fault they scored... You're never gonna be on Varsity and the only reason you even have a shot @ JV is because the freshman team was cut..."  So soccer wasn't that great. And then we found out instead of one week of soccer conditioning, we'd have  two!  That really worried me. Because I started thinking, "What happens if I'mreallyterrible?" I have bad asthma so I can't run as much as other people but I hate to use asthma for my excuse. I hate to be the only one who has to stop because they can't breath.  I wanna prove myself soo bad  but I'm afraid I'm gonna do so terrible that everyone thinks less of me. I knew we ran a mile for a warm up but then I figured we did drills just like on Wednesday's. Little did I knowthat there's a state law preventing us from using any equipment (soccer balls included) during conditioning... So that means however long practice is, that's how long we RUN! Just run...no ball drills or scrimmaging or anything. Now I'm so worried. Today I told my step dad how all we do is run for those two weeks and he says, "If I was you, I'd qu... Never mind I'm not gonna say it." So I say, "If you were me, you'd quit. I'm not dumb, I hear you." He says, "Well, it's up to you..."  Like he expects me to quit!  After practice, my sis came and picked me up and took me out to Mentor to see my cousin who's up from Columbus. Eddie was already did because he had to install some neons in his car. I was hoping my dad would be there but he wasn't. So I just hung out there with my three cousins and uncle and bro til 1ish am. I love that family so much. They are soo close and open and everything. I also discovered my brother drinks.I was talking to my cousin Matt about it and he's like, "Lauren, come on! He's 17, what do you expect?" Eddie did a sweet job installing the neons and I actually stayed awake the whole time. I was falling asleep at like 10 but my uncle came and talked to me. It was cool because he asked me if I knew what I wanted to do for a career and I told him a writer and psychologist and he's like, "Wow. Yeah. I can totally see that fitting you." And I was just like, "Wow." But guess what my step dad said to me the other day? We were talking about college and all this and I was explaining how Columbia is like the top psychology school in the US and he's like, "You? A psychologist? HA!" And he started laughing. "I always thought you wanted to be a lawyer or doctor or nurse  or something more important. " I was just crushed. The fucking guy has been in my life since I was 6! And I've been writing my whole life! My uncle who didn't even knew I wrote thought that'd be a good choice for me. But my step dad didn't realize that even after all the times I've been published. sigh. So I came home, ate, showered, and went straight to bed. Finally, I got to sleep in. But I had the craziest dream. Some guys were over my house and I was the only girl. I was in my room when one of them came in and  started making out with me  but I sorta pushed him away for some reason. I think it was because he was this girls ex and I was good friends with the girl. Then I went into the kitchen and "Eric" (I remembered his name!) was making Mac Cheese (he was like 17) and I was explaining what just happened with "Jon" (I think that was his name or Jason) and he's like, "It's just the way he is." Then I went into my brothers room where all the other guys were and Jon/Jason like came and pushed me up against the bed and tried making out with me again. Then suddenly I was in a pool and learning how to do back handsprings  in the water.  It was crazy because first they made you do some on the ground and then they taught you in the water. Tracy K and Annie were in the dream and they didn't even do anything close to a back handspring but the two teachers were like, "AMAZING!" So I go to do mine and the lady teacher is like, "Oh wow, Lauren! I never thought you'd really try this!" And I'm like, "Well, I did gymnastics when I was younger but then I started soccer so I quit." And she just nodded. There was some thing you had to stand up on and then it went towards the water and you were suppose to do a round off off it but I just fell and did some crazy shit and the guy teacher was like, "Well..." And then I woke up. I read some of Lord of the Flies today, I'm a little weary to admit it  but I think I sorta like it.  I wanna finish it by August 1st and then concentrate on Tom Sawyer all August. Uh, I'm being craving brownies and ice cream soo much lately. But I can't pig out til I get my period. And it's pissing me off because I should have gotten it already. No, I'm  not  pregnant for you crazy people out there. Oh and guess what Margaret is up to lately? Well, today she was an hour late to work where she was suppose to open the store at 10 (she works at the mall) but she didn't open it/get there til 11. So the district manager was called but they couldn't get a hold of her right away so they called the  VICE PRESIDENT  of the store and now the manager has to talk to M on Monday. And if she gets fired, let's just say a lot of bad shit is gonna go down. May I add that she was only late because she didn't get up? And that's why she was late all the other times she was. Oh and she's pretty much  cheating  on her boyfriend. It's hard to explain. Like she hasn't done anything with this other guy but they also  haven't even met!  She talked to the guy online and on the phone (for like3 hours the other night...) (he's lives in Canada by the way) and I'm just worried for her other boyfriend because the last time this happened, a lot of shit happened (me included) and I'm not sure if I'm physically up for any games again...
