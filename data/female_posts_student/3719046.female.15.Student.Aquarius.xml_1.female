Ugh, I dunno, I'm tired and also very bored. I need some friends, dammit!   Well, in my continuing research of my stupid, pointless love life, I have realized the following things:   1. I am incrediblyrepulsive and hideous.  2. Guys are afraid of me and don't like me, so they wouldnt even think about dating me   3. No girl would EVER have a reason to be jealous of me   4. Nobody wants to go out with a freaky, pale, extremely demented weirdo girl   5. Every guy I have ever liked never liked me back...at all   6. My sister is 12 and has had more boyfriends than I, a 15-year-old, have had   Well, that's all I can think of for now, maybe some more later if I'm feeling especially depressed. Goodbye, dipshits.
