Also, if you didn't know, I am just as evil, if not more than, Satan. I know you all know that, however, Amy Fanning will back you up on just how mean I really am. Let me tell you why.  ACT=hard, but the blink/No Doubt concert was vastly approaching and was a very exciting official kick-off of Summer event! The drive was fine, Jenny can't go very fast, but she's my little Nazi. It was horrible, but I was driving and this beat-up old Honda was speeding past. My reply? "Come on Jenny, you little Nazi, beat that Jap!" Yes yes that's horrible. But you see I am evil. Plus, it's a known fact that Japanese cars are the best, not to mention Asians should rule the world, and my little German Volkswagen will probably kill me one day. DAMN YOU ADOLF. What else did I say? It was bad....something relating my car to the Gestapo, oh I don't remember! If you didn't know, I'm not racist, I'm not, stop saying I am... FOOLS I'M MUSLIM! It's really hot right now. Anyways, the concert. We're driving into the parking lot, 1,000 workers with flags every 2 feet were directing us to our EXACT parking spot. SO FUNNY. The line was hot and this kid in front of me judged everything I said. Suddenly, Gwen Stefani came up to the crowd, that girl is so nice. She had NO makeup on at all! You go girlfriend! We finally went in and were the first to pick a seat on the lawn. The next group of people came onto the lawn, by the way it's HUGE, and sat DIRECTLY next to us. Hi, hello, there is probably a mile of grass, and yet you must sit on my lap. Would you like me to spoon-feed you while we're this close? I hate it when people do that! We walked around a bit, and here's where the evil begins. Elizabeth finds a ticket. A seat in the pavilion. I say we keep it. She thinks it's bad. We ponder our next move. We decide to see where the seat is and then decide what to do. She goes down, comes up screaming that we are keeping it and it's right on the floor. We decide to split the blink concert part. I take the first half, I sprint down and watch a few songs. Then I just suddenly grab the guy in front of me and beg for his ticket and then go and get Elizabeth. I'm running, SPRINTING, all around this place screaming "PACK THE STUFF, LET'S MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!" Well, he had a pit ticket, so I had to run to the other side and lie and get a new bracelet. The guy tells Elizabeth to stand on the side, though the original ticket we found had us in the middle, but I promised I'd give back this boy's ticket back, so I raced over to him. Then the pit starts. There is no crossing it. It was evil. So I stood behind the world's tallest man. Hey, it was a hell of a lot better than the lawn, though he smelled quite bad. The guys talked a lot! They were really friendly. Tom wore a bright green polo. His hair was really working for him, as well. This boy behind me caught a drumstick, and I got to touch it..ooh. They walked onto a platform into the pit a little, and Tom turned around and shook his ass, I'm drooling. SO HOT RIGHT NOW AND FOREVER. PS Tom and Mark's kids are getting married, unless I become Mrs. Hoppus first... May/December romance by like 16 years. It could be like Anna Nicole Smith, only I get to have the age spots and ride around in a wheelchair, while little Hoppus gives me lap dances that cause me to grab my oxygen tank and eventually kill me, where he then steals all my millions and ends up marrying little DeLonge anyways, but she keeps her name cause she's cool. That's the future, accept it. When they wheeled Travis off to take him to the middle of the pavilion, like they did at the last show, I started freaking out and screaming, "Okay everybody, get ready, he's going to appear in the middle of the audience.. just get ready!" They all hated me by the way. No Doubt was good, really good. They did a great live show. Kids were freaking out. Old people were screaming at the crowd surfers and taking pictures left and right. At the end, Gwen threw a towel with her makeup on it into the crowd. 20 people tugged and tugged on it for like 5 minutes. I don't know who got it. When we were leaving I saw this guy with a drumstick, I touched it and asked who's it was, when he said Travis I automatically put my cat-like clutch on it and refused to let go. Elizabeth had to coerce me to release my death-like grip. I saw this mom and her three kids walking together in a chain. They wouldn't let go of each other, I was trying to cross, but had to dodge out of their way so I yelled at them, the littlest kid yelled back, I was so pissed I was screaming, "Whatever you little asshole coming here with your mom you stupid baby!" FUCKERS. Somebody flew something at this car and Elizabeth and I screamed at the exact same time, "What the fuck was that?!" Then this car almost hit me. Damn it was fun.
