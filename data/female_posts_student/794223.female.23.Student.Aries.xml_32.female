She has a grade IV + Glioblastoma brain tumor that is rapidly spreading; the oncologist has given her six months to live.  If you are not familiar with this type of tumor, go  here .  It is the most malignant of all primary brain tumors.  Brandi will fight this, because she is strong--and she has hundreds of people praying for her.  When her sister Jamie has to go back to work, I am moving in with Brandi on a semi-permanent basis in order to watch over her and make sure she doesn't have to endure radiation therapy alone.  If all goes well today, she should be released and will head on back to East Bernard.  It's funny how everything else seems superflous--any other minor complaints or inconveniences.  Our family already had an eye-opener when Uncle Ronnie died, but this again shows us just how fleeting and precious life is.  If Brandi lives 6 months or 6 years, we are going to make every day the best it can possibly be.
