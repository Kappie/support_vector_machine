Tennis this morning, went smashingly.  Except for the part right in the beginning when I was laying on the couch and Laura screamed “Oh my gosh!!!  Its 9:10 and we have tennis at 9:00!!!”  Heh, so the tennis sibs and I drove to our lessons clad in pajamas, and dash it all….we did AWESOME!  I would say my level today made it right up to ‘Not completely crap’ and that’s saying a lot.  Cha.
