Frozen 3. Cranberry sauce: jellied or whole berry? Jellied 4. Stay home or visit friends/relatives? Visit friends/relatives 5. Do you cook Thanksgiving dinner, or let someone else do it? I make something to take over to relative's house 6. Traditional turkey dinner, or an alternative (such as vegetarian)? Traditional (our family, specifically) 7. Regular potatoes or sweet potatoes? Sweet potatoes (or yams, which are oddly very similar) 8. Homemade gravy, or the jarred stuff? Homemade 9. What part of the turkey do you prefer...dark or white meat? I like the white meat 10. After dinner: football or Christmas movies? both, actually... we watch football, and continue our family's silly tradition of watching Rio Bravo  Now I go back to reading The Crusaders:  Warriors of God for my World Civ class.  I have a term paper on it due next week.  Oh YAY!  So, I'll post something after I get back from Kerrville... which will be Saturday sometime.  Maybe earlier if I decide to come home and start working on this term paper... but it's doubtful.  Hope everyone has a Happy Turkey Day...!  Have fun with your families... :-)      urlLink  postCount('27Nov2002');
