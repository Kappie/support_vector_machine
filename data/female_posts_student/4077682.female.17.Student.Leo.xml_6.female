He is 21 years old, but you'd think he's younger than me. I think that if you have a younger sibling, you shouldn't fuck with them too much. You should be there for them, and help them out if they need it, but let them live their own life. Don't tell them what to do, or how to do things, and don't give them too hard a time if they mess up. Life is about learning things for yourself, right? so you know....      Generally my bro is awsome, he is super cool and helpful. So don't get me wrong, he's a good guy... he just sometimes doesn't know when to lay off. Buh bye now.
