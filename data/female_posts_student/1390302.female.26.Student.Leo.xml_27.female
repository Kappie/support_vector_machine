If you want anything done, ask a woman."  ~Margaret Thatcher    While surfing the net yesterday, looking up the urlLink  Republican Party  website –I figured what the hell since I decided to rant about it in my last blog.  Anyway, in the process I found this great sight for women called urlLink  Winning Women.   It’s a republican website that promotes the uprising of female politicians.  It’s an initiative by George W. Bush to get more women involved in the one place they have always been taboo: Washington.    I personally believe that what this world needs is more strong, positive female influences.  Girls need more strong, intelligent, independent women to look up to.  Now, women are coming on stronger and stronger in the political scene.  Take Condoleeza Rice for example, her charisma is unrivaled and she is about as positive as they come, in my humble opinion.  There is also Laura Bush, who is a very well known and positive influence on young women.   Still, where there is good there is inevitably bad.  Take for instance Hillary Clinton, who has to be the worst female roll model in the world.  Her views are frighteningly liberal in all the wrong ways.  Less of her is what this world needs, less of all the Clintons!  It’s a great site, positive for women in every way!  ~Kristyn
