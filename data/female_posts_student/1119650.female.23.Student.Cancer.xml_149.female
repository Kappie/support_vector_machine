Perhaps their magical color changing ways would make me feel less bad about the cold if I were being entertained.  I miss the 80's I had this great pair that were like this pretty red mitten with a rainbow on 'em and when you went outside a purple pegasus/unicorn appeared!  My brother had these ones with all these mechanical dials on them and when you went outside the gauge indicators started to show up.  It was cool.  Now I must go scour ebay for them, although I know where I can find some in Manhattan if all the greedy grubs haven't snatched them up!  On the opposite end of the temperature color change fashion spectrum is the awful urlLink Hypercolor Clothing  this is one trend even if i could find I wouldn't want to relive.  I remember if you put 'em in the dryer too many times they stopped changing colors.  My brother got the good one it was blue and turned pink.  I got this ugly green and yellow one cause I was too fat for any other ones.  They also always changed colors around your pits which was uber-embarassing. Blech
