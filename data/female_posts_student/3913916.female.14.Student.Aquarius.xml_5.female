If high expectations are the "key to everything" well why does our school expect more from our section? Shouldn't they expect more from the other sections too?   It is hard to be in the  Honor Section  even though its fun. The teachers expect you to be good at this, at that, at almost everything! It's hard to live up to what they expect you to do. Can't they image what its like to live up for someone else's expectations. It's really hard to understand these people. Why can't they be fair enough? We're just human beings like the other people in other sections.    wala na ko ibang maisip na topic eh...
