Only two dozen people watched Young drop an opening-round match on the USTA's pro circuit 4-6, 4-6 to Robert Yim, a 19-year-old ranked 485th on the ATP Tour.   Most of the media at the Harbour Island Athletic Club  Spa were on hand to interview Antonio Tarver, the new WBC light heavyweight champion, who works out at the facility.  That was fine with Young, who appears to be following the same career trajectory as talented 14-year-olds such as soccer's Freddy Adu and golf's Michelle Wie. In April, facing opponents four years older, Young became the youngest player to win the Easter Bowl boys' 18 singles title in Palm Springs, Calif.      Rising tennis star Donald Young, born July 23, 1989, joins some high-profile 14-year-olds:  Name  Birthdate  Claim to fame  Freddy Adu  June 2, 1989  D.C. United pro called the future of soccer.  Michelle Wie  Oct. 11, 1989  Golf amateur has played a PGA Tour event and placed high in LPGA events.  Daniel Radcliffe  July 23, 1989  Actor plays Harry Potter in the hit movie series.              He has been compared to fellow lefty and former No. 1 Marcelo Rios because of his quick hands and coordination. Some USTA officials mention him in the same breath as Pete Sampras. John McEnroe inscribed a copy of his autobiography, "To Donald: All the way to No. 1."  Others have a difficult time drawing a comparison. Ambidextrous, Young has an uncanny ability to improvise shots. He played two-handed until three years ago, when he went lefty.  Though just 5-10 and 145 pounds, he hits the ball with power on the run, effectively creating offensive shots from neutral or defensive positions.  "With the kind of shots he creates, you wonder sometimes if he's a scientist or a tennis player," says veteran tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who occasionally assists Young's primary coach, his mother Illona. "It's not a question of ability but whether he can physically play with men."   Young, a Chicago native who moved to Atlanta in January when his parents relocated their youth tennis academy, took advantage of a new rule allowing professionals to play in USTA junior events. He still can compete for USTA juniors titles, some of which include automatic berths in ATP events, while still pursuing endorsement income. By turning pro, it means Young will be ineligible for NCAA tennis.  Young signed with the IMG agency in December. He wore Nike clothing from head to toe on Tuesday and has used Head rackets for years, though no endorsement deals have been signed.  "The goal is to not throw him in there too quickly," says Olivier van Lindonk, one of his two IMG representatives.  Life as a pro hasn't brought about too much change in the Young household. Donald Sr. missed his son's pro debut, staying in Atlanta to run the Tennis in Motion Academy. As for Donald Jr., who is home-schooled, the biggest difference is facing opponents hellbent on not losing to a kid.  Against Yim, the reigning USTA boys 18s champion, Young recovered from a 4-2 deficit to tie the first set 4-4 before losing the next two games.   "I have to stay in the match the entire time," Young said. "I can't drift off. I have to stay serious the whole time. I was a little nervous, but it's all a part of getting used to things."  Yim came away from Young's first pro match impressed. "He's got great hands and can put the ball where he wants. He's obviously talented, but you won't know what that translates to until he gets older."  Young has accepted a wild card into the French Open Juniors and will compete in the 18-and-under event less than two months before his 15th birthday.   By winning the Easter Bowl, he's earned slots in the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, R.I., from July 5-11 and the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles a week later.  Illona Young says she's careful not to rush her son. She and her husband have been his only coaches and they won't let him move full time to a tennis academy.   "This is a natural development as far as I can see," she says. "It's been at his request that we're doing what we're doing right now. There's no rush."  Young lists Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan as his favorite sports figures and has met Adu. He says he's comfortable with the high expectations others have placed on him.   "Hopefully, I can be as successful as those guys," he says. "I would rather have the attention if it means I'm playing well. I guess I'll learn to deal with it."
