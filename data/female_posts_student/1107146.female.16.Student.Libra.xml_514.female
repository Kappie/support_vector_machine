I was drumming a few minutes ago. It was really awesome. I also discovered that my room is warm no matter what you do to it, to the point of being unbearable. It's that wonderful yellow, God bless it. It just makes me so warm inside that sometimes it sets me on fire. So it was really hot and I feel like I just got run through a SCUBA gear-less tour of the Titanic. But it's fun pounding skin. So yes.  I think it's time for a nap all. Golly, do I love weekends.  Sigh.
