I found one at Hot Topic for only $5! How cool is that? Well, when I got home, I tried to take the other one out, but Everything was so slipery and slimy, that I couldn't untwist one of the little balls. They were both digging so deep into my tounge... It hurt like hell. There were even tears in my eyes! Well, eventually, after a while of turmoile, I succeded in unscrewing a ball. (omg, how bad does that sound?) I took the barbell out, and I couldn't really even feel the other one go in! So I now have a new barbell in, and it actually fits! I think it's really cool cause it has a jem thingy embeded in it, and it's not embeded in my tounge! Well, I'm kinda hungry, and the swelling's almost gone. My tounge doesn't hurt as much anymore, so I think that I'm going to go try and eat something. Just one more thing though, I sound funny when I talk. It's so anyoing, and embaressing. I can't properly pronounce my c's and s's. It sucks, and I can't even say it! Lol.  Later then...  ~Ani
