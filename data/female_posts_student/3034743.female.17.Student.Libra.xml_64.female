After she left, I talked to Marty on the phone for a bit. Then Amanda came over, and we played Jeopardy a few times. It may sound sad, but its strangely fun. I don't know. Tomorrow is the physics field trip, so that should be interesting. We have to do these experiment things, I don't know, it sounds pretty stupid. Oh well. At least I won't be at school. Well, that was pretty much the extent of my day. Maybe I'll blog tomorrow, maybe not. Who knows?
