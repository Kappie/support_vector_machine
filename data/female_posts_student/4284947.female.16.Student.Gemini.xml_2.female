 Your element is Darkness: Self centered, strong
 willed, mischievous and mysterious. Your quite
 dark and often times frightening, although you
 may be good looking its just a costume hiding
 the darkness of your heart. You detest everyone
 but yourself, people are simply insects to be
 burned under the power of your magnifying
 glass. People are somewhat drawn to your
 mystery but find out to little to late how
 cruel you can be. But you have a passionate
 soul, that is unless you already sold it.
 Pursuing whatever you set your mind to, you
 look at life with a 'Shut up and leave me
 alone' attitude most often because people
 generally seem to annoy you. You may be the
 ruler of darkness but you can often times be
 generally lonely wishing for someone to share
 in your dance of darkness so long as they know
 who is the master.

 Ok... that's kinda true... You may not know it but I keep secrets... Nobody actually knows me that well... Or maybe you know half of me...? Whatever... But they do have some wrong info there. For instance, I don't love myself. I actually feel the opposite!
 
 
  
 You are Pluto...Abuse of Power, Darker side, Spiritual Outlook.You are associated with spiritual changes, development, and political power. Under the strong influence of this planet you will
 experience rebirth (transformations and regenerations of both the spirit and the mind).Pluto's energies are intense and when unleashed it can actually change your entire life, for good
 or evil, so much so that you seem caught up in a whirlwind until the phase passes and leaves a
 complete set of new ideas, ideals, or morals instilled in the very core of your being. It
 also has a purifying energy that allows you to rise to higher levels of awareness. Before this
 rise can come about one must consciously seek to eliminate anything that would hinder you.
