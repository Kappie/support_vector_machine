First of all, we were all pale.....no, I mean PALE! and everyone else was tan.  We also had to get used to Florida's humid, hot weather....we were used to it being only 75 degrees in the summer.  What sucked for me was that my jerk-off brother had to go and fall on my arm and break it just weeks before we moved, so I moved into a brand new state with a broken arm.    We had to live in an apartment for about 6 months, because we were building our house in Broadmoor, so we picked Reflections Apartments off of Tower Rd.  It wasnt Beverly Hills but at least we had somewhere to go.  -The whole reason we moved by the way was because my Aunt Gail, who used to work at the Pretzel Twister didnt want to work there anymore, so we offered the job to my dad who accepted.  That's where he and my mom work now.-  While in Reflections, I met several new friends.  One boy, who was practically my best friend was named Cody Heirlmier.  He had two younger twin brothers named Brent and Blake and we'd all go swimming in the apartment's pool and hang out together.  I also met another boy named Saxten and then a girl named Michelle.  Saxten moved out of state and cody and his brothers moved to Denver, Colorado so I never saw any of them again, but at least we all had good times
