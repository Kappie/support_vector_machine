Tomorrow night will be my last Fusion service... that is going to be THE WORST  HARDEST "goodbye session" of ALL!! Then the grads are going over to Pastor Keith's afterwards to spend one last night with him  Lindy. They are two of the most beautiful people I know, and I'm going to miss them so much. Thursday is going to be a day full of goodbyes to all of my friends  family. Then I'm leaving bright  early (6 AM) Friday morning... What an exciting day that will be!     I'm sooo full of emotions right now! It's overwhelming... excitement, joy, nervousness, sadness, hurt, anxiousness, happiness, relief, anger.... you name it, I've felt it this week! haha. The future is bright  coming quickly... I'll write more soon. Love, Jenna :)
