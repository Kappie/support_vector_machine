So, the Captain has picked up the speed and now we are all green in the face. Just naseous as hell. I realized a bit ago that maybe so fresh air would make me feel better. I haven't been outside in 2 days. I stepped out and it was much better. Supposedly, my office is in the best part of the ship for motion but I think I disagree. I am sitting here at my desk rocking back and forth watching some of my things shift around.  It's weird. Not to mention my stomach is turning flips. I may go downstairs to my cabin shortly and try to nap for a bit. This motion sickness is for the birds. I ate some bread (apparently experienced crew know this) and will have a glass of ginger tea. I guess there are a thousand remedies on board. We will see soon.   Last night fun. The greeks are crazy on this ship. We all went to the officer's mess and sat there and listened to greek music. It was fun. I watched all the officers dance around like weirdos and I listened to more greek talk than I have all ship. I need to learn that language because I swear they are talking about me. (Of course, you know it's all about me...hahahah) Just kidding.  What else. Hmm. I don't know. I gotta work though. I need to puke. I keep thinking that will make me feel better. I fear that once I start, it will never. Sorry to have a blog entry about throwing up. Just thought I would share.   The weather is nice outside though. About 65 degrees, sunny and the ocean has huge swells today. Listen to me, I sound like a true maritimer.   smooches.
