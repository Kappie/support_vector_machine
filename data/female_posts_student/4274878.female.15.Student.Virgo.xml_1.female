First let me explain about the dance team type thing I'm on called City Starz. I love it and I've learned how to really dance and all that there, but I'm not very happy with my choreographer right now. We had our show Monday and Tuesday. Monday sucked, but Tuesday was absolutely amazing.  Anyway, none of us have heard from our director/choreographer since. Rumor has it this was the last year for it and I'd really like to know because I hate having to wonder about stuff I'd rather just know. Plus this group has been a huge part of my life so I wanna know. But that made no sense to anyone who doesn't understand all the City Starz drama I have in my life.      Which brings me to rant #2. I hate drama. I truly hate it. It's stupid and the people who cause it are stupid. Which brings me to      Rant #3.  People who already have a ton of problems shouldn't date. Not only will they screw themselves over even more with all the drama they already have they will screw over the girl they decided they want to dump their drama on. GRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That angers me..... a lot. But I'm not bitter about it really.      Rant #4 Whoever invented IB Proufen should've done a better job. I have to take 4 of those pills to make them work and then Messy gets all crazy telling me I'm addicted. And she's probably right as usual.  So now I've had to switch to migran liquid advil and you can only have 2 every 24 hours!!! That's insane!!!!!!! I need 6 ever 12 hours. But that's ok. Because I'm a good kid and I still follow the instructions on the back don't worry I'm not a crazy drug addict I promise.      Rant #5 I hate school and it starts in three days. That makes me want to start playing with matches. Or accidently getting on a plane, flying to Colorado, and living in the snow. Except now i hate snow and I love sunny weather. Oh well. Living in the snow beats going back to that place.       My head is all up in knots from ranting so I can't think of anything else, but don't worry if I think of more I'll post them.       That's all for now.      Jesus loves you!
