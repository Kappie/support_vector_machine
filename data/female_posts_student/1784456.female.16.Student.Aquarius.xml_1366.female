What good is staying in your house if you have no chocolate! Also my dad kind of isn't talking to me *he's ill too* I 'threw' *dropped* the remote and he had a major go at me. Apparantly I'm a good outlet for anger and sicky stress. Oooh fun. *thud* Really gotta do something about my head! Mmm... I think I'm gonna have to kick some virtual butt on Little Fighter 2! (Soooo boooorreeed!) Ahh! Yeay! I can watch Neighbours twise! (Oh dear GOD!) *zzz*
