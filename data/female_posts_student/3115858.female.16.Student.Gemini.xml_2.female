(he was there for his girlfriend, but felt like talking to me!  whoa.)  i think everyone i know (me included) has  at least  a -tiny- little crush on him.  i'm pretty sure.  i guess what happened the other night doesn't mean anything.  he was just busy.:))))))))  that's the only thing that has made me feel relatively good in the past few days.:*} well, and my friends' birthday parties yesterday...
