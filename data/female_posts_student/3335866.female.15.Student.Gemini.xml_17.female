And now they comein a revolutionary new format.  urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale  is philosophy for the masses and, like, the embodiment of everything I like in the world. It explains the  whys  of everything while using big words, and it has fun at the same time. I love how you can read about Nietzsche's philosophy of the nonexistence of good and evil in reference to Faith (Eliza Dushku's rogue Slayer), and comparing the ethics of Malcolm X with the Vampire Slayer's views on violence... well, kicks ass. This book reminds me of me- it combines intelligence with superficiality at the molecular level. By now I've got it totally dog-eared.   I love books. Sometimes I ask myself what I would choose if I had to decide between books and a TV/internet combo, kissing one goodbye forever. As much as I love the second duo, there's never been that much of a choice. Books have such an extensive history, with me as much as with the world. They're tangible, and diverse, and nonjudgemental. There's always one tailor-made for your personality, culture, situation, whatever. You can use them to distract you from your problems, or you can seek them out when your life is going perfectly. When I was stressed out in middle school I would take a second between classes to go to the library, breathe in the paper-smell, relax, and then leave. They're therapeutic. At one point I had almost 40 books checked out at once.   Right now I'm moving on from the fiction (mostly fantasy/teen oriented) I've confined myself to for most of my life. I'm checking out memoirs, polemics, balanced treatises, philosophy, classics, science fiction. I've got this scary-ass (according to my classmates, probably) reading list I've made for myself. I might not read half the books on it, as I don't know much about a lot of them, but for now they all seem interesting. Watch out, P.
