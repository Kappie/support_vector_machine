But the past week or so has been rather enjoyable, and I am beginning to feel as if I am tasting the goodness of life. And it's pretty sweet. :-)  If Erin calls back anytime soon, I might very well perhaps go to see Sarah in "Fiddler on the Roof" a second time tonight. After all, I have a comp-ticket, and I can't let that go to waste.   Birthday countdown continued: 4 days! You better all be there for me on Monday!
