I was happy to see them busy, but then, I look and their mother is standing behind them, judging them. I thought it looked like their mom was forcing them to play for money. I felt bad for them so I tossed a buck into their violin case, then their mom looks at me with those eyes like "I hope you were planning on giving more". I was about to when Ian pulled me away, cause I was planning on giving them more.
