Except that we got this really gay homework in geometry that made absolutely no sense.  oh well, its not like i'll really complete it all the way.  Oh yeah and today in BCIS, i lost the ability to read and understand english.  Yeah thats right, the language i'm thinking of majoring in when i go to college, i forgot to understand.  So i gave up and turned off my comp.    I'm worried about the blonde kid with no fashion sense! i haven't seen him for 2 days, i wonder if he's sick! aaaah there's nothing to do in lunch if he's not there to critique!  oh well, i hope he gets better.  I MADE A 103 ON MY POLYGONS/AREA GEOMETRY TEST!!!!!!!!!!  what now geometry what now?  i seriously had no idea what i was doing on that test and then all of the sudden i make a 93 and then i get the bonus right, which i totally made up that answer, and get 10 more points!!!!  it was so awesome!!!!  Ugh i am so MAD at my freshman buddy, Adam Hartwick, though because he showed absolutely NO WORK and he copied off of one of his friends and got a 107.  I worked on that test and he didn't and then he gets the better grade.  oh well, it'll bite him in the ass in the end.    My plans for tomorrow.  Hockey game against Flower Mound 6:30 to around 7:15/20 and then to the Lariette show thing (that actually starts at 7 but i'm going to be late) to support my friend Brittnee and watch her solo dance thing for her competition.  Probably not going to do any hw i have that night and i'll probably do it all in french.  yay for blow off classes.    Now its time for the friend story of the week:  Nadia Kudsi  hmmm i don't remember the exact day we met, but it was through Sarah.  I think the first time we ever hung out was at this party Sarah had and we played this game called Encore.  Encore is this extremely torturous game where this card gives you a topic and you have to think of a song with that topic in it and then sing at least 8 words of that song to prove it.  Well me and Nadia were going at it because the topic was....trees or something and we were throwing songs back and forth....until i finally threw "Ontario Sucks" by the Arrogant Worms back at her and she was beat.  We became friends after that.  She was there when i used my "vast" knowledge of Five Iron Frenzy's "Oh Canada" against Sarah when the topic was "guys with a name starting with a consonant".  lol remember "did we say that william shatner is a native citizen...."  good times!  I always thought Nadia was this really REALLY funny person! Everything that comes out of her mouth is hilarious!  She always thought that it was really funny that i have a liking for international men, especially one's from Finland like Niko etc., and that i loved hockey.  We also watched "On the Line" aka that terrible movie that Lance Bass of N'Sync was in together.  It was the greatest movie ever.  She also got to see my famous John Travolta dance at that party.  Since we had some of the same friends (ie Sarah, Kendra, Kristen etc) we went to alot of the same parties.  She invited me to her 16th costume party-birthday-extravaganza and thats where the friendship became super solid.  Lots of pictures were taken, i found out that i'm in Nadia's scrapbook (which is quite an honor since she is the world champion scrapbooker!) and i ended up spending the night, all and all a great party.  And that night, the BopIt obsession began for me and Nadia.  Nadia got this BopIt pen for her bday from somebody and i asked her if i could play with it.  We should've never opened it.  I started the game and i twisted it but that stupid pen said i lost.  You know what i mean, it says "Twist it!" and you twist it but then it says "Oh you lost!".  Taylor Stewart was also there and her and Nadia laughed at me as i said "Damn you BopIt Damn youuuuuuuu!".  We just thought that was the funniest thing ever.  Then finally, i won that stupid game!!!  And then the famous phrase that everyone uses now, "What now ______ what now!?!?!' was coined.  All from me saying "What now Bop It what now!?!?!  what now bitch!!!" while doing a victory dance.  lalala on went on that night, while me and Nadia "bonded" by staying up until 2am playing that stupid BopIt pen and messing each other up while we were trying to win.  So we became really good friends and i started going to VRBC, so we got to see each other alot.  We went on Fall Retreat this year together (along with sarah, kendra etc) and we played BopIt for the entire 3 days as well eating gummie bears.  She witnessed me eating a pound and a half of gummie bears by myself!  She's always been there for me when i have to rant about my guy problems and she's always the one making me smile and be positive when things seem to go horribly wrong.  She always listens to my crazy hockey rants and my analyzations of every game.  She also was up with me at the crack of dawn to listen to me give her the play by play of the USA vs. Finland and the USA vs. Canada games in the World Jr. Hockey cup!!  Did i mention that she thought it was funny when i told her that i cried at a Coppell game when we lost???  lol, i love you Nadia!!!!  Peace out homeslice lol!!!!  World Jr. Hockey cup at 10am, lol, go finland and canada!!!!  "I'm not a girl, i'm a pretty man!", Cheerleader Demon = Mercer  The end.  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~
