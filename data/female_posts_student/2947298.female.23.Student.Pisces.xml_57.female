I thought it was cute. And well as of recently I can't stop buying books! It's crazy, Barnes and Noble loves me, even if it is only for the money. In every relationship it gets to a point where it may end; so one person pulls away and the other holds on tighter. Instead of giving space the opposite effect happens leading to a disaster in the end.  It seems there is a winner and looser even in relationships, I would like to keep my winning streak going. Your move. I like to think there is an ultimate balance, and my balance will come back to me soon. I just hope it lasts a bit longer this time This is a really good quote from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  It is a pretty odd show and takes a certain mind set to understand, luckily I have that extreme mindset! -do you see what i'm talking about?! -no I don't but I'm sure it will get you arrested  Long nights, longer days... all this time, really busy, and yet I don't really know what I do... hmmm I needed a change so I hoped the next train to Colonia, that was nice, and then stayed up all night doing the paper I didn't do all week.  Then work, class and home to see my sisters. I made all of my siblings cds on my new PowerBook G4, Jacquie was so cute she put on her head phones and sung "Hey Jude".   It was that childhood innocence that was so endering.  She's actually pretty good. I found out today I can't go to Florida with them.  It pisses me off cuz the only way I can go is if i bring Ross. I can't drive by msyelf that long, and I'm not allowed to bring ne one but Ross. I think my Dad and Diana like Ross more than me. So its been a few weeks since a binge of drinking...  Funny thing about AA meetings.  You go, they all talk about God (even though it's not religous supposedly) and they all drink coffee and smoke, exchanging drinking for smoking and what not.  Most turn to fundamentalists, or just go back to drinking to shut them all up about God.  There should be a better system not based on a religion.  But you know... it makes for good books (Fight Club, Choke).  Sex addicts have an even more interesting way of dealing, but that is another blog....  So off I go, my Grandma Nikki is visiting and we are going to the Peach Festival and then Johns B-Day....  If I could fix my self I would.... But it's to late for me ::nin::
