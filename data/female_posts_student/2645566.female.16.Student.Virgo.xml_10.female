Now there is something that I never get to do...mostly because in the past we didn't really have a way to communicate (now we have a class together). So I was supposed to do something with Paul tonight, but Emily and Allie came in this morning and told me about our original plans being sprung back into action. I had to go to Em's house. Plan was to mess around with her new keyboard (which is totally awesome!!) and then eat some grub and watch a movie. So the three of us were playin' around and enjoyed dinner together (pizza and buffalo wings *yum*). Then Allie had to leave for Spiderweb. So Em and I did what any sane person would do: pop some popcorn, grab the M's and these new TollHouse candy bar things, and pop in a good ol' Disney movie. The movie of choice was The Lion King 1 1/2. Talk about an adorable movie!!! Lots of laughs and sublte humor. They really tied in The Lion King well. I give it 2 thumbs up.  The most fun I had tonight was after the movie. Em and I just sat in her room and talked for a good hour and a half. We talked a lot about how our "friends" have changed. A lot of them have. Some for the better and some for the worse. It was nice to know that someone had the same view point on it as me. We aslo talked about how much certain people get on our nerves and how the past (3rd grade) was so much easier. Ya know...the simpler things: kissing on the cheek on top of the jungle gym *~!EWWW COOTIES!~* hehehe...those were the days.   Point: I'm glad that Em and I are closer now. It seems that as everyone is changing, our group in particular, certain people are drawn together...I'm glad that I can tell her anything and know that it's safe. I'm glad that I feel the same way about Tori and Chris. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have my friends there to keep me rational in the times when I need them the most. I just want to say thanks.
