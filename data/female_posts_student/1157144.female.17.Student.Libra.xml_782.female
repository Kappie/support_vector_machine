I really don't know what I want to do for my belated birthday party, but I honestly just want to see everyone again. and as the corny saying goes,  your presence but no presents.  and yeah..if Monday doesn't work out, then maybe Tuesday, and then if Tuesday doesn't work out, then Wednesday, and if Wednesday doesn't work out, then just forget it and I'm fucked. so yeah. hope you're all doing well.
