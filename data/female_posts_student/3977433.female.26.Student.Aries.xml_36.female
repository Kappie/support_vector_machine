I have to work tomorrow, buuut, it's only for a few hours, then back home to (hopefully) enjoy the sun and pool. I think it's supposed to rain which sucks. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it doesn't. I want you to do that too.       Hope everyone is having a good weekend, even if you're ignoring me for whatever reason.          See you later.
