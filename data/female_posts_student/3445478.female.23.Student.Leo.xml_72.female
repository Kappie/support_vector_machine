It started the night before, Shawn  I went to our friends house-Mike  Jess-and drank wine/beer, talked, played with puppy's and met their nephew who is 1 month younger than Nick. Speaking of Nick, he was awesome! One of the puppy's played tug-of-war with Nick's wrist rattle! Shawn and Mike drove an old truck thru 10 acres of a sort of muddy race course! The look on Shawn's face as he raced around was priceless. We all had a blast. After that, we stopped by Mount Royal Plaza and got snacks, put Nick to bed, watched a movie while eating sugar filled sticks, wax bottle candy, oreo's, and pizza rolls!!! So long diet! Nick didn't cut me any slack during the middle of the night when he was very very fussy! The morning of my b-day, Shawn  I went to brunch at Belisio's. G'ma Lu babysat Nick and was naughty!-She gave Nick a ride on her new 4-wheeler  let Boyaka like Nick's face and toes. I don't trust Boyaka at all! He is still fairly young and big. Very big! Back to Belisio's....We sat outside and there was Italian music playing, the sun was shining, there was a light breeze. The food was amazing! Tusican Belgian Waffles with blueberry's! And I had a drink...or two!...of something called a Bellini. It's champagne mixed with peach puree. Perfect day. After that we went to a chocolate factory and got 3 chunks of different types of fudge. And then home. And then back to pick up Nick. And then G'pa Daryls. And then home. And then my G brought my present over....background...My cousin and I would buy a snapple or two or three every day last year during school mostly for what is called, Snapple facts on the cap. Yes, we are dorks! Anyway, last weekend while at Toys-r-Us, I saw a Snapple facts game!!!! My GG Koski got me that game! Last night, Shawn and I played the game for forever! It's a lot of fun...I never knew "astronauts become taller in space." Now, I am back to the same old, same old. I wish the weather would cool off a bit. I am ready for fall. Only 5 more weeks left of Shawn internship! I can't wait!!! Did I ever mention, I have the best husband ever!!!
