I Just Can't wait till school starts so i have SOMETHING to do!....I've only heard from a very select few of the friends who "couldn't believe i was leaving" and would "miss me so much"....Figures. It seems as if some people don't even seem to care enough to even pick up a freakin phone and call...and i know it sounds like im relying on others to try to communicate with me but i have called house phones and left messages...so i give up, if they ever wanna come over or get together they can arrange everything themselves, cus i give up. Anyways on a semi brighter note, i am really crushin on somebody, too bad nobody knows who he is!....haha, at least i think no one does...haha. And no, it's not one of the grocery store check out guys, though i must say Lowes Foods has had a fine selection of guys to pick from in the past few weeks. Anyways my mom was telling me about one of my step dad's friends critisizing Bishop Mcguinness as being where all the "wild rich kids" go....I guess people under that category can't be too bad.....5 days till' school....and counting. ...Oh yea...Taylor And Nat , Ya'll are the bomb, thanks for fillin me in on everything and actually talkin to me...haha
