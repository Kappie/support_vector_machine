He's one of the people that I've known for forever and a day, we went to chinese school together when we were like 5. Anyway he just joined this band to fool around and stuff but he's like their main singer and keyboarder and other random stuff...i bow down to this guys musical talents...just don't tell him that...he gets cocky, Anyway you two are like....alike but he's more comedian and less...dare I say dark. Anyway I think you could be a good influence on him and maybe help him on......he's like 5 months younger than me so...you could be like a big brother......his name is Phillip and he's asian...so yes he's s spider. =) gtg byebye
