Now with those Alkaline Trio and Funeral for a Friend references successfully and meaningfully enstated, we move on to other....stuff.   Today I woke up at about 1. I missed a phone call that I've been waiting for forever. Actually I've seemed to miss the only calls that matter lately. But I guess it doesn't matter because nothing is going to change and nothing is going to be ok, no matter what is said. The main reason for that is that, well, I suck at life. Its as simple as that.  I'm still sad. But my day went ok anyway. I did absolutely nothing all day which is ok I guess, but I'd rather not have done nothing alone. There is absolutely nothing I want more than to do nothing at all, as long as Nick is there. But he's not. And I can't fix it. And there's nothing I wouldn't give to fix it. I'd give up everything. I know I'm not worth much, but that has to mean something...  Anyway, after a long lonely day, I had to go to work at 6. This evening I was working with Christine and Nicole... It was good times. Nick's cousin came in 3 times. And of course he came to my window every time so I could get all nice and sad. Then Nicole dropped an entire cone into the chocolate dip. And we laughed for like 20 minutes straight even though it wasn't really that funny... Ok yeah it was. haha. And our boss guy was being a dickface all night, especially after I jokingly called Christine a bitch. :-) Well later on Christine left, an hour before we closed and me and Nicole couldn't finish cleaning anything, especially when Phil and Eustace and Gary came in and harassed us excessively. Eustace attempted to fit his entire body through the window and I wanted to close it on his neck and decapitate him, that bastard. Then they tried to perform a strip tease and such, and Eustace stole all of my lids, which I almost got bitched at for, but I just denied any knowledge of the noise and the fact that there were plastic lids strewn throughout the lobby. Gah I want to kill them. But I can't stay mad at those stupid motherfuckers. Haha. Then as soon as it was 11, Nicole and I busted a fuckin move out of that joint. I think my mom was completely wasted too. Good frickin times.   Things are crazy right now. I don't even know what's going on anymore.  Screw it. I'm tired. And sad.  I fucked up, big time. And I no longer believe in second chances, at least not for myself.  Goodnight. Only minus the good part. So I guess just, Night.
