Windows open all the way People on thei doorsteps, licking shade from dark corners Swear poured into the sewers The men took their shirts off in protest, as the women eyed them jealously Long hair sticking to their back Someone began singing along in a slow, drunken voice "My baby, she's just fine" The sun rose with the temperature Heat washed over them all.
