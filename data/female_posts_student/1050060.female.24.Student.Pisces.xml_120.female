I know i don't talk about Political stuff on my website because it can be boring for some people but since no one has been reading my webpage much I am going to cover the Federal elections.    First thing i agree and disagree about!     WHITBY, ONTARIO - Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said Tuesday he would get rid of the national gun registry and divert the money to strengthen law enforcement across the country.   Speaking in a small Ontario town, the Conservative leader said it was time to get tough on crime and time to register sexual predators.   This was taking from the CBC Website. I agree with strengthening of Law enforcement but get rid of national  gun registry.  Is it just me of is this guy nuts. Why in would he want to do that??? I think we have the best gun register system around.    Second thing!    Martin, who was in Vancouver unveiling his policy on seniors and people with disabilities, was questioned by reporters about a recent poll showing Liberals leading by just four points over the Conservatives.   Martin defended his party's governing record over the past decade, but also admitted to mistakes. The Liberal government has been hammered over the sponsorship scandal and overspending on the gun registry.   Ok that's nice since his getting old he wants something good in place when he retires.  Overspending  on gun registry! We need this gun registry. I don't want our country to end up like the States.    Third!    Marijuana Party gets campaign rolling with seed money!   LOL just too funny!!!  Thats about it for now.    urlLink  CBC Canada Votes!
