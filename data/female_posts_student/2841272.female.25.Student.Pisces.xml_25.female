Only two months into the year we've taken in three movies and since I'm kicking off our forum I'll take the liberty of which film we'll discuss first, though in your postings you can steer the discussion toward any film you like.  (The downside is so can I).  Since  Miracle  isn't as fresh in my memory, and    Euro Trip    is scurrying back into the hole it was made in, let's begin with    Starsky  Hutch   . Now neither one of us watched much television in the 70's, you weren't even an idea in the 70's, so we can't compare it to the original t.v. show, but I did like that the filmmakers kept the story in the original decade.  On the whole I'm not a big fan of updating old television shows to current times (I'll give you props if you can name my one exception), they seem to me like a grunge cover of a disco song-odd and unnecessary.  Much of the humor in    Starsky    comes from the decade itself, like when they're putting the wire on Huggy Bear, so I don't see how they could have done it any other way. Have you noticed that Ben Stiller plays the same character in all his movies- a repressed nice guy with anger brewing under the surface who can't loosen up until a free spirited rule breaker (Jen Aniston, Owen Wilson) comes along- and yet I still really enjoyed the movie.  Stiller has really perfected the character in a variety of films, the dry, witty    Royal Tenebaums   , the hilarious    Meet the Parents    and now the absurdist    Starsky   .  We complain about actors playing the same roles over and over again, yet we give Stiller a pass.  I suspect it has to do with his being a comedian, but that's just a guess.  Anyway sorry my post is so long, look forward to reading your thoughts.  Courtney
