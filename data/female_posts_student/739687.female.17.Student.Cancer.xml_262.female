I think it's kinda funny how he didn't check to see if our names were on any sort of list (because Brad's and Rachel's names weren't), nor did he check to see if we had tickets or anything. He just wrote our names down for the hell of it, and gave us our guest passes and all the cd's and stickers to pass out. Before we headed out to walk around and pass stuff out, Chris and JR stopped in and said hi. That was pretty damn cool. So then we went out and walked around the Arts Festival thing and passed out all of our shit. We got rid of everything (and took our own share) by about 7:45, so we headed inside the club and waited around for a while. Yeah, so it completely kicked ass. Less Than Jake freaking owned. Oh, and we were standing right next to the speakers the whole time (from 8:00 to 12:00), so my ears have been ringing for over 12 hours now, and I'm just kinda waiting for them to stop. Well, my left one stopped ringing eventually, but my right one is still at it.  Ahh, mucho greatness. Well, I'm off to go get a shower and such. Have a damn good day, crazies.
