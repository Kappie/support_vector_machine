These bulbs have a special coating which makes the light invisible to most flying bugs. These bulbs are all-weather so you can use them for outdoor lighting.   I'm so bug-phobic that I may replace  all  my regular bulbs with these.  You can order these online at  urlLink Amazon but they should be available in most hardware or houseware stores.
