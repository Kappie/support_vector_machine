IsnÂt that crazy  How can I find hope in dying, with  promises unseen.. How can I learn your way is better In everything IÂm taught to be.. IsnÂt that crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world.. But to a God who's calling out to me.. And even though the world may think  I'm losing touch with reality It would be crazy  To choose this world over eternity  And if I boast let me boast Of filthy rags made clean And if I glory let me glory In my Savior's suffering IsnÂt that crazy  And as I live this daily life I trust you for everything And I will only take a step When I feel You leading me IsnÂt that crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world.. But to a God who is calling out to me.. And even though the world my think  I'm losing touch with reality It would be crazy  To choose this world over eternity  Call me crazy  You can call me crazy Call me crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world.. But to a God who is calling out to me.. And even though the world may think that I'm losing touch with reality It would be crazy, It would be crazy, It would be crazy To choose this world over eternity  IsnÂt That crazy.. Call me crazy You can call me crazy Call me crazy Mercy Me  It would be crazy to chose a boy over the greatest boy one... Is my eyes truly on him and his prize or me, and no prize... Well today nothing really is going on. I am going to Josiahs thingy... Which is cool. ge to see how he is doing. i'm going with Shannon and stuff so thats neato..
