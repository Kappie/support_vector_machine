I feel like im just a dumb kid who gets in the way,  adds to their problems. Yup.. these are the best years of your life right? Hm.... Well apparently I hide everything so well.. I mean I'm always happy right? Yeah. Last night was so damn dumb! Steph came...  I felt bad cuz johny reese  brad were here  yeah... well that must have sucked.. then vick came  saved the day. But we ended up just randomly driving on River Road... And we went all the way by this culdisak so the 3 cars could figure out what we were going to do til curfew...  we saw this other car so we just honked  drove away... Little did we know that it was a FUCKIN COP! So I guess it followed johns car for awhile... and pulled us over. It was stupid.. the damn cop just walked up to the car spitting...  was like "so what were you doin back there?" haha .. it pretty much went like that... but he like accused us of smokin pot  shit.. Which was totally untrue. Some people are SO dumb! Like instead of following us.. he could have just hidden out for awhile to actually SEE what we were doing instead of just assuming shit! But ... anyways.. yeah so thats how my night went! God.. sometimes I dont know what I would do without my friends.. I mean SHIT! All of them like make me happy... I would be a lost lonely soul without some people. But yeah... Nothing left to say.. thats all, ASHLY
