Her voice cracking she told me that her mother in law passed away that morning.  Monty is devastated. He also  buried his Dad 2 years ago.  I just came back from the Temple.  My emotions are running very high.  She was 67 years old.  Again, way too young to go.    Everyday of our lives should be live to its fullest.  Some day we will regret not speaking or hugging or even laughing with someone.  Life on this hearth is so very short.  On this very rainy Friday.............Be Good  urlLink
