On the drive up we stopped for dinner in Lake George Village which was really nice and we ended up going to the  urlLink Stewart's  for some fuel and some super yummy orange soda.  I wish we had Stewart's around here.  )c:  We ended up staying at the Hotel Suites Le Faubourg.  If you guys are planning a trip to Montreal I definitley reccomend a stay here.  The rooms are huge, its a brand new construction one block from St. Catharine street and its in the heart of the downtown area.  It was like we had an apartment for a weekend: huge living room, huge bedroom and a kitchen to boot.  Only thing is the website said they had "high speed internet access" but it cost $10 a day, so we didn't end up using it.  We checked in pretty late Friday night so we just crashed in the room and were all bright eyed and bushy tailed on Saturday morning.    We ate lunch at this awesome little Asian place called "SoupBol" and went shopping on Saint Catherine street which was a lot of fun.  I ended up finding a new favorite store!  I wanted to go to  urlLink Roots  which is like the Abercrombie of Canada, but alas they were just as pricey.  I ended up instead in a really cute shop,  urlLink Le Garage , its like a Canadian Contempo Casuals hooch mart, but I really liked it.  Lots of cute clothes, lots of BRIGHT PINK! clothes, it was quite Gwennish indeed.  We stopped in to the  urlLink Canadian version of D'agostinos  for some beers to drink before we went out.  Dennis LOVED the walk in beer fridge and just kind of stood around inside it for about five whole minutes just oogling all the beer.  We went back to the room and I would like to say  I WAS NOT DRUNK , yet, but I walked into the wall face first.  What made it worse was Dennis had been in the other room and wouldn't have seen it, except he went to take his shoes off in the bedroom and was witness to the whole thing.  Saturday night we ended up at  urlLink The Casino Montreal  which was a lot of fun.  I ended up doing really well on the slot machines there and the boy of course played the "ponies".  It was crowded as anything though, so we cut it short and left whilst we were up.  Sunday morning we ate at this awful place called Rubens, the food was decent, but the service was atrocious.  Our waitress spoke only in French to us even though we were ordering in English and she not only attended to everyone who came in after us, but served them all before she served us.  Its not like our meals were anythign that took a while to cook.  We ordered French Toast with eggs and a cheeseburger.  Damn, rude Frenchies!  Sunday afternoon we went down town to the  urlLink Montreal Science Center  and did some neat hands-on experiments.  Doog sat on nails and made TV and radio shows and me, being the nerdy girl that I am, learned Binary.  I sat there for about half an hour until I taught myself how to do it and then I made Dennis go back to the beginning of the museum so I could answer the "Binary Math Quiz".  Oh and we saw this cool thing where it was how you turn pure electricity into water.  I thougt that was badass.    We went back to the centre of town and had a mini bar crawl starting at "Iggy's Pub" where 1 Smirnoff Ice and one pt of Stella Artois was $15!  We did get to check up on the NFL progress and I will give him props (Hun, ya gave me a hellatial asswhompin this week).  Anyhow, next stop was Dundee's, what a great bar.  Good atmosphere, nice bartenders, strong drinks.  A great time indeed.  The final stop on the "crawl" was Stogie's/Ice/London Pub (a three in one place) where I ended up with a sub-par apple martini, but a great view of the street on a really nice little terrace thingy.  We finally ended up at our dinner location:  urlLink Mexicali Rosa's  where we got some really AWESOME tex-mex food and a whole pitcher of the strongest Sangria I'd ever had.  Needless to say I was a little blitzed at this point, but we drove back to the hotel room.  Down the busy main street of St. Catharine, through the confusing construction zone that was there and right when we got literally 5 feet from our hotel parking lot we got stopped by the Fuzz.  Thats right.  I started panicking thinking I was gonna get a DUI or something, but they were very nice and let us go.  Turns out you're not allowed to make a right on red anywhere in Montreal.  So if you ever go there, please follow the rule!  The cops were very nice to us though.    Monday morning we were a little sad it was our last day, but we ended up eating at Nickel's Diner, this chain of 50's style diners owned by Celine Dion.  It was acutally really good food and the waitress was nice.  We ended up going to some like garden of plant statues (I'm sure it has a name, but I dunno what it is) down by the Science Centre and it wasn't worth the money we paid to get into it.  We just thought it would be a cool place to get some pictures of the two of us together, but alas everyone there spoke french and looked at us like we had three heads when we tried to ask them to take a picture.  After the bastard rose garden thing, we went to the Notre Dame Basillica which was just a few blocks away.  It was really stunning and if you ever get the chance to go there, even if you aren't Catholic or even regligious the art work alone is breathtaking.  After being in such a holy place we had to up the sin factor and we went back to the Casino where I lost all my money (but it was the end of the trip so who cared).  When we got to the border we stopped for some duty free shopping and were given the shake down by the bull dyke border guard who stopped us for about five minutes.  Dinner at Friday's on our way home in Saratoga Springs and then we were back home before we knew it.  It was unbelieveable though how quickly a six hour drive can pass when you're engaged in conversation.  I left out the inside jokes to spare y'all, but I'm sure they'll be back in another blog soon so don't feel too left out!  Honestly I can say it was one of the best weekends ever!
