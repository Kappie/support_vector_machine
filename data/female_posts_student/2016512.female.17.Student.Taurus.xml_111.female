(Canadian style)  i also wrote a mission statement, which was pretty pathetic and didn't really say much about me. i guess i could post it on here. we were actually supposed to put it on cds but wouldn't you know it our family actually burned some tunes on ours. whups! oh well it was fun all the same. here's me mission statement, which was written on some scratch paper i stumbled across. yes!   Betso's Mission Statement     I am.    I am a mover and shaker.    I strive for the best in myself and in the world around me.    No one can strip me of my values and ideals    I live each day to the fullest.    My attitude and outlook on life shape my world and the people in it.    I stand up for my beliefs.    I don't pass judgement.    I am an equal. Pride and differences never stand in the may.    I look over and above the limits. No mountain is too high. No task is too great.    My dreams will not be sacrified.    My pursuit of happiness has start now.    I follow my creedo always, with the true spirit of life.      "Work like you don't need the money,    Love like you've never been hurt,    And dance like no one's watching."   Well that's my sap. Of course i never shared it with anyone, so that was the first coming out party. woot! other thoughts -i got my prom dress fabric. very exciting. it will be red with black accents. hazaah! vintage all the way!  Loving it, so hot right now,  -Betso
