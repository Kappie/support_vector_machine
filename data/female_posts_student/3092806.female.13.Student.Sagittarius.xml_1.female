The sky was a pleasant blue, the clouds were like giant, white cotton balls hanging in the sky, the sun was shining down in brilliance, and the temperature was not too hot but not too cool... Everyone was outside rollerblading, having picnics, playing basketball or soccer, swimming, jumping up and down on gigantic trampolines, and participating in many other social gatherings. Well, that is everyone but me. I, Kelsey, sat glued to my computer screen. Both my radio and t.v. were on. The radio was playing heavy metal music and the television was broadcasting a commercial on coffee, but they were just background noise. I was typing furiously. However, the background noise grew louder in my ears... Frustrated, I turned both of them off and opened a window instead. I needed background noise in order to live, I never liked complete silence. It crept me out too much.. This noise would be much better, it would allow me to concentrate on my work...     I turned back to my computer and typed in the last few sentences of an entry for one of my blogs, 'Koala Peace.' After carefully reading it through for any grammar mistakes, I published the post. After five hours of neverending writing I was completely finished with my blogging for the day... I stretched back, lazily... It was time to get something to eat...     I walked into my kitchen and made myself my favorite snack, a peanut butter sandwich... I stared, miserably, outside the kitchen window. I knew that I should go outside or work out or something, but I didn't feel like doing things that I just had no interest in. I became rather angry. It wasn't fair that my interests didn't revolve around sports and things like that... I loved writing and reading, don't get me wrong, but I'd love to have in interest in something other than that, that kept me fit... With the creative mind of a writer, I envisioned a terrible storm to plague the beautiful day and ruin things for everyone outdoors. I had already had a plot and the beginning sentence for a story, before I snapped out of it... It was useless to put my anger into writing... It wouldn't change anything... Sighing, I went back into my room to a couple more hours of computer time.      Many hours later, I was laying on my bed trying to get some sleep. It was three o'clock in the morning. The lights were out, the television and computer both off, and the air conditioner was on at full blast. Besides the dull roar of the air conditioner, there wasn't a soundthroughout the entire house. Suddenly I heard something hard bounce off my bedroom window. Frightened out of my mind and hopeful that what I had just heard was imaginary, I pulled myself deeper underneath the covers. Yet again something else bounced off against my bedroom window. I let this happen two more times before I summoned enough courage to see what it was.   Wrapping the covers around my body, I got up and krept over to the window. I pulled back the curtain and looked out the window just as a good sized rock smacked onto the pane. At first I jumped back on impulse but then I looked back out the window to see the figure standing on my lawn that was throwing the rocks at my window. Squinting, I managed to identify the figure. I pushed the window open.  "What are you doing here?" I called in half whisper and half scream.      This story is not complete. I'll add more later.
