Woke up this morning but i didn't go to bed, i was watching the whites of my eyes turn red...Now that I'm back from disneyland, now that the adventure is over, i find myself in a terrible rut. I have NOTHING to do today, tommorow...well, nothing of interest or excitement anyways. I have to go buy a new bra because mine convieniently broke itself at disneyland, and I need to go pick up my retainers. Wooo, sounds like a fun day and a half.   One of my fav moments at Disneyland.   Picture this. Standing in line for Indiana Jones on a Saturday night. Genie, myself, and her parents are standing behind this group of 12 year old boys who think they're the shit. You know, punching each other and saying "fuck" a million times. The following ensued.  *boys start punching each other* *one hits me in the arm* Genie: "Dude, calm down, okay? stop freaking out, we're trying to have a good time here" Stupid backwards hat kid: *stares and gets afraid*  Genie is way up in the kids face at this point. They stared each other down for a minute and then the kid weasels his way through his little group of friends to be protected at the front. HAHHA...oh man.   I need to go get pictures developed as well. Right now my future day looks meek...god i need to find something to do.
