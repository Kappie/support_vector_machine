Since my earlier post I have done the following:  a. showered b. drove to school (stopped on the way for ice cream... I love summer... when it's not 100 degrees out) c. sat and started replying to emails and what not in the lab. And read Meghan's blog... It's really my only way of keeping up with her d. procrastinated to keep myself from actually doing work. Which I love to do. What is wrong with me? I am a work-a-holic I swear. Lately I can't seem to stay on track though. I get pulled off my thought process too easily.  I looked through a lot of my possible future home's stuff, and I think I have decided I would really like it. Probably a lot. Hormone research isn't too far away from things like pheromones and stuff. Which really interests me lately. I can see myself being cooped up for long hours on end in the building I visited, and loving it. And I do like the marmosets allready. I fall in love with animals quickly. So now... I'm only praying I get in. I think I will. I hope I will. With my research background it shouldn't be too hard. Hopefully. It's awful to be nervous about something I will be doing a year from now. If everything goes according to plan.
