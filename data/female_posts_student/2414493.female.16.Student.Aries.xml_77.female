When I'm older, I'll write an unabashedly pathetic autobiography and enjoy all the unecessary drama through which I've put myself. It will be a riot, I promise.  Two keys to happiness: hard work coupled with hedonism. I have never realized how true that is. I think I indulged too much in the latter today, though: two hours of thorough vegetation on the couch eating leftover sushi, taking a nap. Realizing at 8pm that I still have an anatomy letter to write, realizing at 10:15pm that I still have math homework to complete. Surprisingly, I remain unfazed. This is probably bad. The Szyumanowski needs revamping before Sunday.  Going to Taco Bell for lunch with J and A completely made my day. My week, maybe. Sunshine after the rain, the imaginary rain now. It's so nice to do something normal again, for a change, though I don't advocate severe assimilation. Men of the moment. Friends. Life. It's funny--after lunch today, I could probably tackle anything for the next day or two. Fuel for the laggard soul.  Failed another English quiz. Ha. SAT II Literature? You bet.  I hate people who talk to you only because they need help. Like H. I'm taking a nap, and she calls: who's signing your form for Excelsior? Just get your parents to do it and write a note for Mrs. Freeman. Bye. Then just now: how many hours are you putting on your form? R's putting 15. I don't care. Well, I just want to put the same as you. I don't care, just do whatever. Well, we practiced for two hours a few times, and then we went to Hillcrest and Los Robles...I DON'T CARE. That, and S asking me about Spanish homework. Every time. I love you predictable people.  Today's the only day John Mayer's "St. Patrick's Day" works.   In A's words, I'm out.
