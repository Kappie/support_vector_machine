That's more action than I've had since getting freaky with Natalie at Charley's in Pocatello!    Skipped morning pages this morning and it's thrown me off all day.  Just don't feel like doing anything.  Actually, that's not true.  I feel like doing things, like taking notes, studying and typing them, etc., only half-heartedly.  Even now, I'm finished with everything, but I don't really want to leave because I'll just have to go down to the SUB, pick up my W-2, then go to the mall to secure the Parents' Happy Anniversary card.  It's just too much!  Plus, January's decided it's not giving up on Winter just yet, so we've had a steady stream of snowfall all day.  I could get back to Levi's sister about an essay she requested my insights and opinions for, but even that would be half-assed at this point.  And we hate half asses.    But the weekend seems to be shaping up.  Will have enough homework to save me from boredom, and am thinking I'll check out Pieces of April at the old, hippie, liberal-run theater downtown.  And the Golden Globes are on Sunday night, so I'll have to spend a good half day getting ready for that.  Wow!  Suddenly the world seems like such a perfect place!
