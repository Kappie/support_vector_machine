Drew's. hehe. anyhoo...she had all the people write something on the back of it. it was so cool. brandon mad me this awesome frame with more pictures in it. candace gave me a cool pen, some paper and some envelopes. i wonder what she's trying to tell me...umm...i got a watermelon magnet and this cool bath confetti from erica. zola gave me a mix cd with a poem she wrote on it and a cool necklace. oh and rene gave me a calling card which is a good idea so i dont waste my parents money talking on long distance. my mom's friend tom came too with some of his daughters friends. they were cool people. when i was getting food one of the people that came, oliver, was getting pixi-stix and said "ahh...so many memories....of bad headaches". and after the movie tom was like "im gonna get you that movie. ive decided thats what im gonna do for you birthday next year. and im gonna copy it. im not gonna buy the real thing. cuz ya know that pyrated (sp?) movies are always better than actually buying the movie". it was cool. tom is so funny. i think all ya'll would probably like him. oh and his daughter liz was talking about how her room-mate phil always wears her skirts. he's not gay! but she goes to like a hippie school and people do wierd stuff there. but really skirts are kinda comfy (the long ones) and think how comfy a guy would be in one? i mean scottish guys wear kilts so its not totally wierd.... i dont know...just think about...if you want to.....well anyhoo...i got some interesting advice..."if you are traveling and you want to have fun just ride a grayhound bus." i guess it would be kinda cool. ive neverbeen on a grayhound before. and tom kept talking about how my birthday was 4/20. then when they finally left oliver was like "happy birthday anna" (he did the peace sign like dustin does) and i said "but its not my birthday" he's like "oh well...happy...uhhh.....going away i guess"  but he was really cool. and if it wasnt for him we wouldn't have been able to watch that movie so he's a good guy for having that dvd player. yeah. even those college kids thought it was a cool party so im glad. alrighty... i think thats all i have to say.
