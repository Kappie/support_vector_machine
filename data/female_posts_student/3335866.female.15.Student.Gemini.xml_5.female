No one, At All, ANYWHERE, cares about this blog- except for me. The only reason to put any effort into it is because maybe, someday, when I'm a famous Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Ha ha! As if) my fans will search the depths of the 'net for my old work and pull out this. Hmmm... At this rate, I'm not even going to get a C on my term paper. Okay, seriously now. The reason I'm starting this thing is that I want to be a writer. I'm kinda keeping this ambition under wraps, though, 'cause I seriously have no idea if I'm any good at all. My dad thinks I am, but, hey- he has to say that. He's my parent. But if I want to have any chance of achieving this at all I have to actually, oh, I don't know,  write something . So I'm opting for this, because even though I can't think up good fictional characters or soap opera plots, I am fairly adept at commenting on my own life. Now all I have to do is actually post to this thing...   Mmmm... today's events. The most notable and fresh in my mind is my walk home from school. After waiting for my dad for more than an hour (in which I had nothing to do except braid and un-braid this one strand of hair) I finally gave up and started trudging home. Not the best idea, considering my flip-flops and 20-lb. backpack. I hate walking places. It's not that I don't like being outside, it's just... the people. I mean, when you pass a person on the street what are you supposed to do? Should you make eye contact, smile, and offer friendly salutations? If so, how long should you hold eye contact for? And will they think you're intrusive and/or psycho if you stare too long? But on the other hand, if you just avert your eyes and walk quickly past, they'll think you're unfriendly. So what I usually end up doing is trying to avert my eyes, but still darting glances at the person who's walking past me. I have a feeling this is very trapped-squirrel of me, and way weirder than anything else. So, yeah. I'm walking down the street, backpack full-up on my shoulders, and this car slows down next to me. The Hoochied-up passenger said, and I quote, "Why you walkin' like that?" before speeding away.   My initial reaction was, 'Do I know them?' My school wasn't that far away, and I thought maybe someone was just puzzled that I would sit outside for an hour, and then just get up and leave. But then I realized, no, that's not it, I'm walking so bizarrely that a total stranger felt compelled to comment on it. It's not the first time someone has mentioned this. My mom's always telling me not to stoop over (I've got tall-girl-hunchback syndrome) and my friend's (meddlesome) mother once noted it also. But the rudest comment I ever received about it was when once in seventh grade this eighth-grade boy that I didn't know said, "Hey, aren't you that girl who walks weird?" when I asked him to stop blocking the door to my homeroom. I mean, COME ON! This is America! Doesn't anyone have the right to walk like they want without getting all kindsa grief about it? I'm not one of those people who wants to be informed about their annoying quirks. I'd rather stroll along in blissfull ignorance, as I don't change easily. Anyway, I digress.   After the car pulled away I kept walking, mentally debating with myself. An incident like this is all it takes to put me into overly-self-conscious mode. (If the kids I went to school with were bullying types I would be so dead.) I kept shifting my backpack back and forth between hanging it off one shoulder and putting it all the way on. I was trying to figure out which would be the least likely to cause a weird walk. It was worse than it might've been otherwise because I was walking down what was basically a highway past a bunch of people in cars waiting to move on. I was the only one on the sidewalk. Why is this bad? Because, in my world, that means that all eyes are focused on me, something I hate. When my mom used to go to this weird peace-love church everyone would get up and hold hands in a circle at the end of the service. I was always paranoid that the person looking at me from the other side of the circle was mentally criticizing me. Keep in mind that I was  eight  at the time. Jesus. No wonder I'm so messed up.   It wasn't until about five minutes after The Incident that I realized that a confident girl, the type of person I want to be, wouldn't have been bothered by this. Cool-me wouldn't even have noted it, except for maybe flipping the car-person the bird. And even if she had she would have come to the conclusion that she can walk however she wants, and let other people say what they please. God, I wish I was my cool self, my alterna-universe Poire. It'd be mondo, uber, wicked, totally and very very kewl. Well, I guess this incident has gotten about as much- oh who am I kidding, WAY MORE attention than it deserves. This ability to rant on and on about nothing bodes well for my blogging future, as I don't have many significant events in my non-life to talk about.   Currently Reading:  On the Road  by Jack Kerouac. Stole it (not literally) from my English teacher, 'cause she's been practically begging us to read it. It's not quite my thing, but then I haven't: a) been to college, b) been a boy or c) ever had sex. Anyway, it's kinda too depressing for me- I don't think I'm a Beat girl. (By the way, the 'Currently reading:' thing is stolen from  urlLink pamie's  weblog. Just wanted to give credit where credit was due.)   Peas out, y'all.
