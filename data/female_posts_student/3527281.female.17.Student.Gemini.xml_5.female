Well, I know him because he also was musical director for the youth theatre productions at Mansfield Playhouse.   Well, just before the fall performance of Annie Jr, Brian moved to Chicago, where he'd been offered a better job. But he's moving back to Mansfield this fall. He took a job at Shelby.  Brian is the coolest guy ever. He's hilarious and a really good music director besides. He can make anyone laugh. Well, he stopped by our cast party to say hello and tell us what was going on.   well, thinking ahead to Hillsdale's future, I told him that if his job at Shelby fell through, he could always take a job at Hillsdale in a couple years when Mrs. Sherburne retires.  Brain laughed at me! He said Shelby was far enough away from civilization, thank you very much, and that he had no inclination to teach at any school with "hills" in the name.   So I told him I'd put our band up against any band in a three-county radius, and we'd see who was laughing then!  Don't rag on the small guys!  PS- he'd still be a great choir director!
