Got back from Edmonton safely and soundly. Getting my pictures developed tomorw, and I've already aquired Erin's and Brietta's online ones...The links are:  Brietta: http://ca.f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/stand_anddeliver/album?.dir=/7665.src=ph==.done=http%3a//ca.f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/stand_anddeliver/my_photos  Erin: http://ca.f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/feathered_starfish/album?.dir=/aee7.src=ph==.done=http%3a//ca.f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/feathered_starfish  Can't wait to get Gavin's, and the picture of my butt! I'd write more but I'm tired and cold, and I want donuts. Love you all, love one more.
