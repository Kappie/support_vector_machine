Then my papa is coming home soon.  How cool is that?  You know what I was thinking about today?  It would have been cool id Ed took my last name...I mean, come on now, I get pregnant, gain the weight, go through hours of labor, go through breastfeeding and all the recovery of childbirth, and retain all the weight...why the hell can't we have my last name?  haha  oh well, not like i can do much at this point, but just something i thought about today.  random, i know.  oh well.
