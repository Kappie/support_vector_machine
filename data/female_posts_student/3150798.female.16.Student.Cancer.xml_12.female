I've been thinking a lot about clothes(pathetic, I know). I am well aware I won't have much money(Young Life Camp has totally depleted my funds). This last semester I tried really hard to look sharp with all the American Eagle and whatever, but most of the other girls who wear that stuff had way more than me. And I was never really comfortable. I know clothes don't make the person, but I think they should reflect the personality. So I'm gonna have some fun this year. Mostly just jeans and inexpensive tees, but stuff that reflects me and my musical tastes and...whatever. And, I really want to learn how to skateboard. I don't really know what that has to do with anything. And I want to get my nose pierced, and am planning to do so. I think I'lll make most of my own  jewelry  and stuff. I am going to try making some guitar string jewelry. Anyways, that is just something that I've been thinking about. Anyways, I am going to be a lot more frugal in my wardrobe this year, and maybe I can save up for a  car !!! Maybe...
