(That's how they say it in Indian movies!) I can't imagine it would be much different than the Cleveland community. Bengalis are so family-centered, showing up as a young single woman is like way taboo. My only saving grace is that I'm a dancer, and they all love that. Here's a runthrough of typical experiences as a young Bengali.  All the aunties (older women) want to know who your parents are and what they do (score 1 if your daddy's a doctor, score 2 if mom is as well), for future reference of course. They ask what you're doing in school (and to them, I am definitely doing the wrong thing in school.. after all, when will I ever get married?!?!)). They ask where in Bangladesh your family is from, and in my case, I know my parents birthplaces and thats about it. But I couldn't even point them out on a map if you showed me. They look you up and down, and spying my belly, they'll say "Ohhhh, you look so... healthy." Which means I really should point out that their's is ten times bigger. We got super healthy aunties over here. If you opt for Express over Indian clothes, you get glared at like you're wearing a brown paper bag with the word "Disenfranchised" on it. And let's not even get started on what would happen if I don't eat meat (which I don't sometimes cuz I'm not a fan, and I used to be all veg.). They talk about vegetarianism like its a mortal affliction. Let's see, anyone with a chid between the ages of 14 and 30, will introduce me to their female kid who's the "same age as you, you can be friends." And then of course, all they ever want is to get their kids married off, but then there's NO opportunity to meet any decent guys. Cuz why would a girl talk to a boy? God forbid men and women could interact without jumping eachothers bones. The attempts at sexual repression border on ridiculous. Especially knowing my generation doesn't follow the rules anyway. Hmm.. OK. I guess I'm not missing much by not going to this picnic thing.  And I love my culture. Really I do. There's so much color and poetry and art and beautiful clothing and music and great movies and the language is so pretty and the family values are so deep... but in practice, its just plain silly sometimes. OK, I'm done ranting and raving for the time being. :)
