I understand pretty much what we are doing in math, so that is good too. Computers was really dumb. Good thing I only had to be in there for about 15 minutes. Ok, Mrs. Parker now says we can't even go on the internet at all because of some virus going around or something. I dont really know because I wasn't listening.  And then I had just finished my assignment, and I was just about to save when all of a sudden, it closed down on me. So then I told Mrs. Parker what happened, and she just told me to write her a note saying I completed the assignment. So that's good. Then I went to some thing for juniors about colleges and what-not in the auditorium. I didn't pay too much attention cuz me and tommy kept messing around (not in that way..haha).  Lunch time is when my day turned interesting. I'll start with the funny part first, and then I'll get into the non-funny part. Ok...the funny part deals with me and Theran. We decided to "noodle" the pretzel stick. Ok, by "noodle" i mean, Lady and the Tramp style. So we do that, and then for the shortest second, a little portion of our lips slightly touched, and ryan was convinced that we kissed. we totally didn't! i just wonder if he will tell lori. but theran was saying that lori wont believe ryan, and that lori likes me anyway, so as to not worry. i'm not too sure tho.  now as for the other portion of my eventful lunch time...somehow the convo turned into who has been drunk and stuff before, and theran was like "i bet erica hasnt had any alcohol" (or something like that)and i whispered to him "um, you're wrong" and then he didnt believe me, so he called ethan over cuz i said that ethan knew the story...so he asked ethan about it, and was like 'well, she wasnt really drunk, she more or less just had a good buzz' (this happened like a year ago, and when it did, i told ethan about it but no one else) and then holli was convinced that i was lying, and kept asking me about it. and well since it embarasses me to talk about it, i told her about 4 times that i didnt want to discuss it at the current moment...so then about 5 min pass and then she's like "you're kidding!" and im tired of her never believing me, so i throw down my hand (as i threw down my hand, my food fell) and yell 'Holli....fuck...im not kidding! ok, can we just drop it?!' and i'm about to cry, and she just looks at me, and then she walks away from the table...and then in physics she asks to talk to me about it, and i'm like "i really don't want to talk about it, ok?" and she was like 'well, i dont understand' so then im like 'holli, please, not now' and then after school she was telling me how she was mad at me because i was the one who threw my food at her (when it fell out of my hand and didnt even hit her) and embarassed her in front of the whole table...when in fact she was the one who was embarassing me cuz she wouldnt drop it, and then she was like 'why didnt you tell me?' and got all mad at me and said that i made her mad because of my reaction, and she couldnt understand why i was mad at her. it's really stupid, but it still makes me mad! ugh! oh well....that was really all the exciting points of my day. I'll blog tomorrow (maybe).
