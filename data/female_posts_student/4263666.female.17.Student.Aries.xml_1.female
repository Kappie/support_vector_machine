We went to wasaga and a couple of day trips here and there, but i never feel like i've done something worth doing. Next summer, I want to take that job on a cruise ship before school. I need to be alone and experience the world by myself for once. I need to learn not to depend on anyone else and to see everything in my eyes. An entire summer without friends, family or Woodbridge....thats what i need.  -j
