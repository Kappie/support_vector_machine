Yes, blogg ar  different from brogg er . its some free downloadable software that lets you type stuff in a different window thing and you can save and it isnt online...its basicaly like a word processor version of the website. i like it cause i got pissed off with the website for deleting some of my previous entries. so wahts up with me? schools annoying. too much work. i have an english speech to write. erg. on how holdens admirable. its not that bad, i do think holden is admirable. i just dont want to work on it. i changed my mind. mr johnson is pretty cool. and i get to bribe my freshmen this week. "bribe." im not realy bribing them...im just brining candy cause im a nice sophomore. or something. euro is a little less mind-bolging. no news otherwise. still havent had emily sleepover like i wanted to. grr... sometime... she said..well, i dont remember exactly what she said, but something somewhat comforting yesterday... along the lines of "sometime soon, i promise" and was actually listening to me when i said theres a three day weekend soon. good signs? methinks yes. i hope, anyway. its ("it"...) getting bad. to the point where other people are noticing. michele...heather...martha somewhat...caitlin...my mom sort of...crazy. theyre all like "is it hard not seeing her so much now that she has a boyfriend?" and what am i supposed to say? i dont want to blame eric...i dont know that it is erics fault...probably partially. she does sit with him in the mornings now... and he is the reason shes busy some weekends. but, i dunno. i just gotta deal with it. being sad and wishing it was last year or 8th grade or summer school or...anything but what it is, doesnt do any good, does it? i keep telling myself to just not worry about it and keep doing all i can to talk to her...thats the best i can do. better to light a flame than curse the darkness. optimism. power of human will. if i put my all into something, i cant fail. all that. but...ive already talked too much about this. dont want to creep emily out if she reads this. ...so what have i been up to?  well, this weekend...mmm, i worked in the church garden on sunday morning. with michele and andrew. it was okay. dont really know what that has anything to do with God, but whatever. community service is good. was awkward with andrew. dont really know him that well. used to talk to him sometimes...not anymore. no classes or anything. hes a good guy, though. michele told me im a romantic...or that i am romantic...one of those. something along the lines of "you wouldnt know it, but youre such a romantic." i thought that was interesting. that was after we were arguing about which is the best disney movie and i said beauty and the beast and she said lion king and i said "but beauty and the beast is a love story." i suppose shes right. depends how you define romantic. those kinds of things are things almost no one knows about me, and the ones who do know them dont know much. im not at all what i appear to be. not deep on the squish inside, anyway.   most people arent everything they appear to be, though. but what can you say a person appears to be? you cant tell much about anyone from their appearence. the connection between a physical person and what you know them to be has always been something i never quite liked. partially cause i dislike the physical world. like, on my profile, it says "a soul is worth a million times the flesh." and i really believe that. but then its weird...cause yesterday, when i went out with cait and kara and jessica...i was at caits, right? and i look over at jessica...and i dunno what i was thinking...but i was looking at her teeth and i was just realizing i have no idea what her teeth look like. ive never payed attention to her teeth before. not that this shocked me or anything. just...i dunno. reminded me of when i was just looking at emily for a while in arziona and she was all like "stop staring at me, its creepy"... its good to memorize people though. its amazing how different people are. how unique each person is. i got to thinking about that when i was looking at jessica's teeth. not just their teeth though...and i dont really mean that physically at all... everyones soul is quite different. then that got me thinking about how incredible just one person is... and it got me wanting to know my friends better. and thinking about how emily said "it feels like you hardly know me anymore"...and i dont know if she meant that or not, but i feel like i want to know more about her now...ive always been up for learning new things about her. makes me  really  want to get to know her though. makes me want to say i know her soul. and do i? i dont know. hopefully partially. but how do you go about knowing someones soul? i have no idea... you have to really talk to them, i think. like, really. and i havent been doing enough of that. but i want to....i really want to. ...stupid friends and their busyness. thats not an unreasonable request, is it? "Emily, please come sleep over so i can try to understand your soul, so i can know you beyond all facts and opinions and preferneces...so i can know what you are...those things that you are that you cant even explain. i want ot know those things." on one hand, how do you say no to that? but on the other...what  do  you say to something like that? maybe im just really crazy... but its hard to know that, to you, someone exists beyond mere existence, but that you do not fully understand everything that this person really is... its hard to be in awe of everything someone is and not want so badly to know all of those things.  and, wow, ive got to finish my homework and get to bed. so screwed for my english speech. damn. oh well. night.   urlLink
