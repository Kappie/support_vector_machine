It was when I read some weird "liberals suck!"  urlLink website , criticized them, and then wistfully remarked that people should stop criticizing each other?  Yeah... well, the guy who wrote the post that sparked me, read MY post and skipped the sarcasm. SO nwo he and his buddies think I am an illiterate, fat, liberal, teenaged relative of Michael Moore, or something.... And they think I am angry at them, or something. (Well, I am kinda angry now, but I wasn't when they went berserk on my comments option.)  And they criticized my grammar and tone!  urlLink Who would EVER be that nerdy?   I dunno. I wish sometimes that people would take things with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure my post made at least one of you smile. And if I can just stop one person out there from saying shitty things about "the others" without thinking about how pointlessly rude it is, then I can die happily.   And since so many of these people would like me, my references to books and music, and my damn colloquial tone dead, then I think everyone will be happy.  FROM THE PISSED CONSERVATIVE DUDE'S SITE - SOME COMMENTS ON ME: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:24 pm by Jason  'ur' blog is betta, Lee. like, fer shur. that dude is all, and i'm all, and he's like, whateva...    DUDE! What are you, a sped? No one says "fer shur" anymore. It is "fo shizzle." GAWD!!! *twirls hair around finger bershonly* ------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:24 pm by Nick   Wow,  Still, he (or she) has zero comments, so maybe he (or she) is actually a complete fucking loser as well as an obvious fuckwit.  He (or she) couldnt get a clue in a field of clues, covered in clue attractor on the clue-iest day of his (or her) life,  Nick   Clueless, you imply? But I ALWAYS figure out Blue's Clues! (note the link to my man Steve Burns at left.)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on May 31, 2004 @ 10:29 pm by Sipidation  Read some of the other great post like:  Samstag, Februar 14, 2004 "forty-two"  Some of my friends tease me about being a "sex addict."  Freitag, Februar 13, 2004 no, not the sandal  I am wearing a thong.  For the first time in my life.  And ya know what?........... I don't hate it.   You would think these guys would get the "forty-two" reference.... but since they obviously don't read entire posts, that wouldn't really matter.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 12:13 am by Matthew Spence  I think her list of links says all you need to know about little audrey.    Oh no! So, reading blogs is.... NOT cool? NOT intellectual? NOT politically involved?  "I'm Captain Obvious! ANother mission complete!" ----------------------------------------------------   Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 8:35 am by Josh  "Bigger than my body gives me credit for." Could this be Michael Moore or his daughter?    Um, if "I" am bigger than my body, doesn't this mean that a) my body is small in stature or b)that my "soul" is big?  I dunno.... I guess you guys know everything when it comes to figurative language.  -------------------------------------------------------------------    Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 10:08 am by Paul  Clearly this asshat has never actually read the Geneva Conventions. It's amusing to see the phrase "Geneva Conventions" bandied about by people who have no clue about the contents.    Oh yeah. I totally stated that I read them, eh? Actually, what I got from History of the AMericas was that it had standards for how POWs are treated. But then, I have no clue, right? ---------------------------------------------------------------   Posted on June 1, 2004 @ 10:12 am by Drumwaster  Or the phrase "International Law" (with both words capilatlized, as if that would make it both real and applicable).    Yeah, cuz I said that. *eyeroll* And your spelling AND grammar make me want to vomit.... liberal propaganda, that is! ---------------------------------------------------------- AND FROM MY OWN COMMENTS. -------------------------------------------------------------------  Was there a point to that incoherent rambling? - Brandon    Yes. It showed my own calculated hypocrisy, essentially trying to tell people to NOT be hypocrites when it comes to this whole stupid "right-vs-left" thing.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Does the geneva convention apply to non-military combatants? - Jason    Nope. Well, I'm not the lawyer in this family, but I have always understood it to be a "time-of-war" kinda deal. Bu I'm a stupid liberal asshat, so maybe you should ask someone else. And am I stupid, or is it "Geneva COnventions?"  Anyone else seeing a new kind of advice column? "Dear Liberal Asshat...." --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    http://ian.gerdesdesign.com/images/news/liberal.jpg - marc    Yes, ma'am.   I'll gladly stay out of combat.  But don't use the word "pussy" around me again - I have an irrational cat phobia, and the chauvinistic implication of the way you used it is awakening the feminist within.   Grr.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    What the hell are you on about, you stupid American douche-bag. I’ll agree that this article is a poor example of liberal bias but only because there is so much more out there, in greater quantities; however if you really can’t perceive the bias here then I pity you.  Tell me when was the last time you saw the mass graves newly found in Iraq being plastered all over the media? I doubt even Fox News went that far. And yet your talking about 1000s of lives gone, executed; and all they get is a small slot on CNN, gone in a day. Now when was the last time the prisoner scandal wasn’t plastered all over the media? UN OFF scandal? Nope. Bet you don’t even know about that. - Poosh    Wait.... when did I talk about "1000s" of deaths? Are you even on the right page?  I would appreciate it if y'all would read my posts before attacking them, mm'kay? *head bobs, teeth sparkle, ponytail bounces*  Also, grammar = SUCK. But let's ignore that. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Such drivel, young 'un. Hope you learn to write someday, keep practicing. And when you grow up and assume some responsibility in this world you'll look back and realize what a little idiot you were. - Bill OH    One of my managers at one of my jobs calls me "littl'r'un." Is that what you meant?  And as for the responsibility thing, we won't go there, especially after the post you're referring to. Obviously, OH ain't no TOK.  (or LA - your grammar is pretty sad, too.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    ON the one hand you deplore right-thinking.com's author's lack of tolerance and political rigidity, on the other you say that 'the sun is setting' because essentially you disagree with his opinions. Those in glass houses....  I do agree that the US should be held to higher standards in its treatment of prisoners than dictatorial Middle Eastern kleptocracies. I don't think that the rationalizations for the prisoner abuse are so much an ends-justify-the-means as a "yes, we're human, and imperfect, but lets keep this in perspective" thing. Yes there are limits to this view, but I don't think that you should dismiss it out of hand. - David   David, I think you're cool. Thanks for saying what you want to without being rude about it, as well as highlighting my point for the others. And I think "kleptocracy" is one of the best words I've heard in a long time. (begin sarcasm) you are going on my "friends" list that I have to start to prove that I have them. (end sarcasm)  The "sun setting" thing actually referred to how I foresee Americans killing each other because we get so angry about disagreements. But thanks for pointing that out and giving me a chance to clarify, anyway. You're hot. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    (And by that, of course, I must mean "kill a Republican.")   Such peace, love, and tolerance.  At least Lee doesn't say to kill people for their beliefs in his blogs. - Josh   hahahaahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha *breathes* hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah *breathes* Oh, man! You can't make this stuff up. You really can't.  If everyone in the world thinks like you, I can understand why these people think I harbor ill will toward them. Verbal irony, anyone? Point, anyone? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I think its pretty clear that she's being facetious with the 'kill a Republican' statement.  But in her post, she seems to doubt that there is a general liberal bias in the media, and seems to find conservatives of her acquaintance fanatical. I would hope that she would not be so rigid in her worldview so as to not be able to see what is in front of her, or be unable to have a respectful conversation with someone who disagrees with her. David    Again, David has kindly assisted the meanies in understanding me, while still saying what he thinks about my opinions. Criticism WITHOUT malice? Could this be what I was searching for in the post?!?!?  David, will you marry me?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Audrey,  "An American teen. Bigger than my body gives me credit for."  But apparently larger than you own sense of self-importance.  If you're going to Fisk someone, at least have the presence of mind to counter with good arguments; otherwise, your words will be and have been taken as nothing more than the vomit of your mentors.  Further, I could not find this quote anywhere in Lee's post or the comments: "tha Ay-rabs." This must be a racial slure of your own fabrication?  Before you slam other people, take a closer look at yourself. - Kurt    Hey.... I love your name! Are you German? I LOVE Germans!  Wait.... if I'm bigger than my own sense of self-importance, then I have no self-esteem. I actually think my own sense of self-importance is bigger than me. Is that what you meant?  I mean, that whole "vomit" thing is nice and original*, but I didn't realize someone had told me to think this way. I dunno. I thought I had come up with this on my own, but I guess it was brainwashing by CNN or something.  Also, the "ay-rabs" thing was not put in quotation marks to denote quotation, but to denote an "abnormal" figure of speech. Something out of place. Something.... facetious, even? FY infizzle, it is an inside joke with someone. Probably an imaginary friend, though, if you buy into what my buddy Nick said earlier.  So did you want me to look more carefully at my hypocrisy, to which I devoted an entire post, or what?  [* - denotes sarcasm]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Wow, you have been bitch slapped, havent you? - Kimble    I would indeed have been bitch-slapped from here to the moon and back again, had I taken myself as seriously as some of these people do.  And did you know that your name rhymes with "thimble?"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Cool Dude, I say you hang out at Right-Thinking. You just might learn something. You might be surprised to learn not everyone is a Republican. Its nice to see you lump everyone into one box. How sad. - Kilroy    "Wait.... what?..... That's cool, I don't even care." I guess that even though I refer to many non-Republicans here, I think everyone's Republican. Might as well go "hang out" in this "box" of yours that I apparently lumped people into at some point. Does it involve free food? Because me and my father Michael Moore need fuel for our hatred.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Man........ I should have seen this shizzit coming, based on the comments pages  urlLink here  and  urlLink here.  But it's all good.   I'ma go dream up new ways to spread propaganda and be mean to conservatives.  (Just be fucking CIVIL to someone for me, okay? Make my "loser" life worthwhile.)
