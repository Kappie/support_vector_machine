(ya no, or not) actually, i like school, and now that i don't have any, welp, i dunno wut to do, i can only clean my room so often, and do only so much laundry, and write so many "exciting" emails, before i realize wut a loser i am, and colapse and go to bed, but once that cycle is finished, then i'll b fun, happenin and all that jazz. so ya...if u have something fun to do...lemme no, and if im not busy (which is pretty likely) then i'll b there! im not into bad stuff tho hehe, anyhow, im really bored and i gotz nothing to say as usual, so i'ma lift off now! byby, changedfish
