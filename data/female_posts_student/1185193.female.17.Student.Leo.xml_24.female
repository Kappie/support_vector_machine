This, due solely to the fact that Bruce Jovanovich of the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Program tripled his income by convincing superiors that his research into penguin migrations was a vital component in the war against terrorism. His raise, when averaged with the income of the 17 other scientists huddled in underground bunkers in this frozen God-forsaken wasteland, increased the per capita income of the continent by 22%.  Jovanovich has already invested his largess in the local economy by installing an open-air Jacuzzi from which to observe his penguin subjects. "Sometimes my binoculars get a little steamed up," said Jovanovich. "But it's worth it just to sit there in 105 degree water with the antarctic wind whipping through my hair! That invigorating sensation really helps me do a lot of science, which as we know is essential to stopping terrorism. God bless America. And also Antarctica."  Jovanovich's neighbors are somewhat less enthusiastic about their continent's economic boom. On condition of anonymity, one ice core analyst commented through chattering teeth, "Bruce is such a jerk. Now please excuse me while I massage some feeling back into my frostbitten extremities."   ___________________  Just to let ya'll know, this is not turning into any kind of politics blog, I just thought it was pretty funny.  Same with the last entry.  Hope no one was offended by the obscene language.  Anyways, in news about my life: Break has been very lax.  In a good way.  I have spent my time lounging in my pj's, only showering and getting dressed to go to the gym, doctor's appointments, and dance classes.  Tonight, however, I am seeing Thoroughy Modern Millie with my dance teacher and some other people at the CPA.  I am SOOOO excited.  It is like a big tap show!  Funstuff!  That will be the sole reason for me showering and getting dressed.  I should go to the gym, but we'll see what happens with that.  Tomorrow is my lunch date with Veronika.  I really like eating at Benson at SCU because the food is really delectable!  Makes me hungry just thinking about it!  Then I have a doctor's appt. to find out about my blood tests I had done.  I am a little scared about that.  I hope everything is fine and they don't find out anything else wrong with me :(  Oh...so Wonder Woman rehersal yesterday was INTENSE!  Seriously...every dancer in the room was about to pass out after going through the dance...and it's not even complete yet.  We learned this tricky new combination that is very intricate and quick.  Boy, oh boy!  There has been talk about performing at St. Martin's Fun Day...Gosh I hope not!  I am not very confident with all the moves yet.  And most likely the dance will not be finished by Fun Day...I hope.  I REALLY want to perform the Jeffersons though!  That is a fun, fun dance!  The five of us in our 'lil (or should I say HUGE) afros getting out groove on!  Hehehe.
