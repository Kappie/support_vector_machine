"only use the yellow ones," "only use the green ones," "right foot stand, left foot over." crazy cool. after scaling the wall we attend spider man 2. i had a really hard time sitting that long. i think i have a slight case of ADD. at least that's what Gwen and Rochelle think. sure i thought about completely other things besides the movie and sitting for 2+ hours was difficult, but i know what happened and i made fun of it to my hearts content. and after our viewing the posse came to my house and we watched My Little Pony. as terrible as it was i enjoyed it. now i realize that my standards were low as a child. and i don't like My Little Pony anymore. oh well there's still Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jetsons, and Sailor Moon. *sigh*  Shame on, Shame on, -Betso
