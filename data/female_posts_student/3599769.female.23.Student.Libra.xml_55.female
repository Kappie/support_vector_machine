I started off right, with shots of Rasberry vodka and somehow ended up with Budweiser. WTF? Anyways I played bathroom patroll for my bro since he kept throwing up every 5 mins and his gf was nowhere to be seen. I stumbled home and passed out.  Oh, and no drunken phone calls. Woohoo!  Saturday: Did alot of driving around. For no reason. Couldn't sit still, but didnt really want to talk to anyone. So I just drove and drove. So depressing. But I did manage to visit my friend at the cemetery. It was nice talking to him, although stupid inconsiderate me forgot that his dad, (who died a year later, almost to the date) was buried right next to him. I didnt even think to talk to him too.  So after I left and realized what I didn't do I felt like shit all over. That was only the second time I have gone to his gravesite in the year and half since his death. The first time wasn't even at the time of his burial. So I decided to turn in early, but at 10pm I hear someone banging on my door and get this: I grabbed my ciggys as if it were a gun. Oh my God, when I realized I had done that I couldn't stop laughing. It turns out it was my bro, crying. I thought something really bad had happened. It turns out him and his gf broke up and I'm talking this boy was screaming crying, all huffy and couldn't breathe. I asked why he was so upset, they were always breaking up. He said that she told him she didnt feel the same way and that it just wasnt gonna work. (Sound familar?) All he kept mumbling was "This isn't supposed to be like this, if it doesnt work for a reason, okay then. But its not gonna end because we just didnt want to try. I am not gonna fail at this." Once again, sound familiar? I wonder if it runs in my family? Is it contagious?  Sunday: I went to church, and couldnt stop thinking about how cold I was. After that had lunch with my aunt, then went home. Tried to nap but didnt succeed. Then my bro went and picked up my sistors and we tooked them swimming and ate pizza and watched movies. It was fun, but reminded me terribly of my munckins. They just got home on sat. from a 2 wk stint with thier mom. Lovely boy was off on sun. and prolly spent some quality time with them, time that I miss dearly.  Sunday night finally closed and I was thankful. Mornings and Sundays are the worst for me.  Thank God the mornings almost over.
