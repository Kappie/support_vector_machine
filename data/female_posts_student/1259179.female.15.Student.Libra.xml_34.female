The fact of me having a third surgery is starting to scares be Bejesussss out of me.  Oh well, such is life.  OK on a much ore important subject...  I love Bob the Bachelor...  He is so adorable.  Can you believe this ladies that go on these shows and get totally drunk, THE FIRST DAY..  Yeah for them... Can they not hold their liquor or what.  Last year you had Amber, who by the way, loves the Olive Garden, totally passed out on someone else's lap. And now, you had BIMBO, swaying and making no sense what so ever.  Gee that is the fastest 15 minutes of fame ever.  What a way to be remembered, drunk or a stacker/wacko/nutso on TV.  I am babbling.  I have a little update about my school.  I told you before that I was taking a course to become a Relaxation Therapist.  I have completed 3 modules and I have 2 modules left.  My grade point average is 88%.  I am soooooooo happy.  I never had so much fun studying.  When I finish, I hope to do something to help others. I have lots of plans and ideas.  Let's start be finishing and getting my diploma.  OK enough said....  One more thing,  please register in my MAP THINGNY....  OK for real, I need to make dinner so have a great Monday evening and ..........Be Good
