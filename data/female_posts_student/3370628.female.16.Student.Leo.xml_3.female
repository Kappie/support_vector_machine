Got Kazaa Lite to download again, having uninstalled it a few weeks ago in an effort to get Diablo II to work. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get it again, as they're asking you to pay for it now, if you go to the official site. But, meh, got it off a multiple download site type thing, and it's working just spifftacularly.   That's about it for interesting news... Well, my group in drama finally got another few scenes recorded for  The Faketrix . It's not going to turn out as well as I had it in my head unless I can do some magic with editing, but meh, it's just a student film. Nobody is gonna expect it to be blow-you-away impressive. I actually got to play some notes on the bass guitar today. Once I got a little oriented with it, I was all right... Going to take a bit for me to get used to it, though. I've been reading nothing but treble clef for the past three years, and I was never particularly strong with which notes are what in bass clef back in my piano days. But, meh, I'll manage.  *pauses and twitches* Oh how I loathe those idiots who fuck up the songs that they upload to Kazaa. The main reason why I took the initiative to get Kazaa Lite tonight was so I could download  Broken  by Seether and Amy Lee, and so far I haven't had much luck getting it. Whenever I try to download it, it'll fiddle around for a few seconds trying to find a user, and then tell me that more sources are needed, even though there are two hundred some-odd results for that particular song title. I  did  get one to download, but to link this back to the start of the paragraph, it's got some fucked up noise about twenty seconds in. Absolutely  hate  that. Yeah. And I just literally went through and started  every flippin' result  downloading, and none of them will even que. Such utter, utter bull.
