I want to stay in and devour Book 5, having watched The Chamber of Secrets last night (in addition to The Dreamers, which was totally great by itself, but it ALSO had the Garden State trailer on it....gasp!!!).  I'm fighting off a summer cold and the preemptive medicine I took last night is lingering.    Made an appearance at the festival this afternoon, though, and apparently caught the eye of a young, buff, Japanese-American cop with braces named Janet.  She's from Boise but is in town for the festivities.  She sent a messenger to The Voice of God asking for an introduction.  Kathy's put me on the 'let them in free' list, even though she'd rather take advantage of me in her office.    I'm still not in the mood for a drag show, but I knew the moment Kathy said "No, seriously.  She wants to meet you." that I'd be going.    What should I wear?  Oh, and Happy Birthday to Brandon!!  I'll have a beer and shake my ass in your honor.
