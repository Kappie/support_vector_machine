From reading Bridget Jones I've decided to keep a daily journal like she does, though it won't be going on the internet because it's going to be quite a bit more personal. It's nothing new anyways...before this blogger thing I've kept written journals since I was 12. It's fun to read them occasionally...interesting to read about how opinions form and change over the years as you get older.    I remember my first kiss. Jon attacked me in Lindsay's downstairs hallway. I was moving in to give him a kiss on the cheek( because he had been bothering me about giving him a kiss all day) and then at the last moment he turned around and kissed me. I went home feeling like my innocence had been stolen from me...I think back on that now and laugh. Geez. Every last shred of my innocence has been stolen now.  tim wants me to go swimming with him and a bunch of people right now, but i'm feeling somewhat insocial and he just made a big freaking deal of it.   summer must: popsicles. Need to go get some so they're on hand.  It was freaking hot today. blah. I hate being really hot almost as much as i hate being mega cold.  hawaii-11 days.  Going to the gym tommorow, excellent. I've felt like a slug these past couple of volleyball-less weeks.
