What is  it , you ask? It is the best cookie/candy bar on the market right now: the much desired and envied by lesser candybars, Kinder Bueno. While Twix, another loved candybar, comes in at nr. 2, it can never ever win from the coveted Kinder Bueno. KB has the crunchiness Twix has, yet nothing of the heaviness. It's a wonderfully light cookie filled with delicious hazelnut cream. Let's take a look at the pros and cons of both:   The pros of Twix:  relieves you of cravings; has a cookie; has chocolate; comes in two's   The cons of Twix:  has caramel; is heavy; while it relieves you of cravings, it still leaves you somewhat unsatisfied;  "Raider"  sounded cooler than the sissy  "Twix"    Conclusion:  one must admit that while Twix is delicious and very capable of relieving you of awful chocolate and nicotine cravings, its caramel can often be an obstacle to thoroughly enjoying the mix of flavours and textures Twix has to offer. The way it lodges itself around your teeth is just plain annoying. Now let's compare Kinder Bueno:   The pros of Kinder Bueno:  relieves you of cravings; is a cookie; has chocolate; comes in two's; has no caramel; is entirely filled with hazelnut cream   The cons of Kinder Bueno:  none   Conclusion:  as we compare both candy bars, we clearly see that Twix is no match for the superior Kinder Bueno with its creamy center and delicious crunchiness. Its sweet, nutty flavour light as a feather on your tongue, enjoyed by many around the world:      urlLink Visit the KB site  (in German) to support this cookie.
