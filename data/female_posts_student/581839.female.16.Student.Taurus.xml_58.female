So for at least 3 days, i won't be on. I have science in ten minutes. Nothing much esle is going on. I have to finish my history homework, and i know i'm going to fail my math test because i don't understand any of it, and i miss the review session before the test. yeah, i'm really lucky. I have to go. Ciao
