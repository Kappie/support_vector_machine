A message always gets fucked up on it's way down the line... someone misinterprets something I say, or they say it wrong to the next person, so it ends up becoming this who said what shit.  It's stupid.  I can't even have a normal conversation with someone without them blabbing it to someone else and then it making it's way back to the source as a completely different thing.  Whatever... screw you guys.  I picked up an application for Jo-Ann fabrics, I hope I get the job.  I still haven't heard back from the Rosemount theatre about my online application.  Scott is also applying there so I was hoping that we'd have the chance to work at the same place, that'd be cool.  Then I picked up an application for the Apple Valley subway because Alex works there, then I go inside to see Lee picking up an order and Alex and Cari behind the counter, I thought it was kind of funny.  So I pick up the application to find out that Alex's last day working there is Saturday because he's going to work at Target instead!  Total bullshit!  Ah.  So now I'm going to have to apply at Target, I probably have a good chance at getting a job there because I'm friends with Jessica's mom, who could help put in a few good words for me. :)   No one can resist me.   I went to Office Max with my dad today.  Saw a hot guy staring at me that worked there... yummy.  Unfortunately I didn't have the balls (literally and figuratively) to ask for an application to work there, too.  Oh well.  I got my really cool Vinyl CDRs that I'm planning on burning my new NIN collection on.  Woo!  They came in cool colors, too.  Unfortunately I owe my dad about 10 bucks for them... 10 bucks that I  don't  have.  Heh... I wonder if he'll forget.   Damn.  Nothing good is on TV.
