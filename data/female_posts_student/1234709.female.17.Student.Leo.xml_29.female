Everytime I hear his name, or something that reminds me of him, I get the excited/anxious feeling in my stomache like I want to jump him, or something. I haven't seen him in so long; I'm almost forgetting what it's like to look at him. I wonder what's going to happen.  I went to Randi's yesterday, and we went to the mall. I bought a pair of aviator sunglasses (which surprisingly look alright), and we took a bunch of random photobooth pictures. I love those, so I've made a goal to do that with all of my closest friends.           16. Take goofy photobooth pictures with a friend   We eventually made our way back to Randi's where we made art projects and giggled about things, and played videogames well into the night. It was while we were gaming that I realized I need to play more, I'm losing my gamer's hands. Randi, I love you so much; don't you ever forget that. And make sure I never forget it either.
