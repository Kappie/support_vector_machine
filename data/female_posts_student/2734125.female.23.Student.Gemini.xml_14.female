I can recall my sister coming home from the hospital.  I can see the inside of the car, and Dylan, still slightly rinkled and pink, eyes closed in a hospital blanket in the back seat with me.  I think that I was riding in a car seat, as there is a grey plastic edge in the corner of my eye.  The inside of the car is hughs of brown.  My mom isnt there, but I think that my da' is in the front seat.  I know that my mom wasnt there, as she had to stay in the hospital after Dylan was born.  We were both C-sections, and my mom didnt recover well after that second time out.  I think that this would be my first memory, though I have a very early memory of growth.  I recall walking by the counter that wound around our kitchen.  We lived, for the first eight years of my life, in an old house in denver.  The kitchen was huge (or my body and perspective small).  There were red tiles on the floor, and a wood stove in one corner.  The smell was a cool musty, the smell that comes from dust and red tiles and colorado light.  I walked by this counter through the swinging door every day, and it was always at eye level.  I can see the dark brown crushed wood bits that were on the edge, and the white under coating of thegreen plastic top.  And then this memory, of one day being slightly higher.  The edge was no longer level with my line of sight, it had shrunken, or I had grown.  I could just see the sun slanting in from the sky light, heavy motes of dust drifting through what must have been a summer day (the light had the rich red tones that do not appear untill after june 21st) and settling on the TOP of the counter.  There was mail there, white paper, still higher then me.  I paused, and took a breath, and hear clearly in my mind, "I have grown."  I think that it must have been one of the first deeply seated self reflective thoughts.  There is an old home movie with Dylan in the kitchen.  It is her birthday, which is in december.  Out the window in the yard you can see my father and I making various snow things.  On that side of the yard was a plant box with bleeding hearts in it, but another entry yeah?  So Dylan is sitting in the kitchen, with her birthday dress on, and my mom asks her "So, how does it feel to be three?" and Dylan holds up her hand, palm up as if some precious stone or snowflake sat there, gazes at it, and in a calm voice says, "bunny."  My sister is a buddah, and I am overjoyed that she is my first memory.
