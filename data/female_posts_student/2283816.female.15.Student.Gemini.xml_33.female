What's the g-d point? LET'S DO SOMETHING!!   I am SICK of standing around and looking at each other and pessimistically pointing out all the problems. Lighten up. We can find a solution if we START WORKING. Get off your lazy ass and help out, okay? Did Albert Einstein sit on his ass all day and say, well, if I already had the solution I could START researching and experimenting. Yeah? No, I don't think he did. He accomplished something.  Which is what I want. All I want is for something of mine to go RIGHT for a change. We have the materials, might as well.   *is very, very pissed*
