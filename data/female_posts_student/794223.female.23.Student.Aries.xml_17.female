Some key background information regarding my current situation:  -I get this email from UT the other day telling me, "Oh, yes and by the way~You cannot apply to graduate in December if you are currently enrolled in a class at ACC."  Thanks for telling me this ahead of time, ass holes.  -My grade from Cuba (Fall 2002, a YEAR ago) is just now getting here.  Let me repeat that.  MY GRADE FROM A YEAR AGO HAS JUST NOW GOTTEN ACROSS THE OCEAN TO MY STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM, WHO THEN FINALLY SENT IT TO UT.  -My Oceanography professor emails me, tells me that she cannot send out a final grade until the end of the semester, but would a note suffice?  -I go back to Liberal Arts.  No, a letter will not suffice--you need an official transcript from ACC, before December 5th.  The fall semester at ACC doesn't even end until December 12th.  -I call ACC in a panic.  They tell me that I can get a transcript sent out earlier if I finish the course at an earlier date, if I fill out a 'Early Grade Release Request form' and have my professor sign that form and place it in a sealed envelope and then have that taken to Admissions and Records to be processed.  -I go to ACC to pick up said form, they tell me I cannot get the form until I have an official letter from UT stating that I am a graduating senior who needs this grade released early.  -I return home, wanting to throw something.  Dammit, I am going to graduate in December; I have worked too hard to graduate in 3 years to NOT, and it would be rediculous to have all of my coursework completely finished for my degree and then not receive one.  So now, I just need to hurry up and finish this course at ACC (like in the next 3 weeks), get my study abroad credits (finally) processed, and have Profe Salgado turn in a grade for my thesis (for both semesters).  It will then be done!  And I will be done.  And I will take one long, extended nap next semester.  With a degree for December 2003 on my wall.  Gosh darn it!
