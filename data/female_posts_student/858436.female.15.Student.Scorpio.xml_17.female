I wish my aunt and uncle and cousins would have been there, but they were having all of my uncle's family over to their house, so they didn't come. I really want to have a normal holiday like we used to have.  We'd all go over to Mamaw and Daddy Sam's house and have the holiday lunch. Mamaw, Daddy Sam, Mom, Dad, Virginia, Charles, Aunt Rebel, Uncle Mark, Holt, and Boothe would all be there. And sometimes Ovie and Glennon. We would all eat and talk and visit, and if it was Christmas, we would open gifts after we ate.   But then holidays got different. For Thanksgiving 2001, we went to Alabama instead. For that Christmas, we had my mom's family over and then we went to Mamaw and Daddy Sam's later and we were the only people there. And Easter... *sighs* It was a fairly normal Easter. We did the egg stuff at my house, but then all the Storys were going to our new cousin's christening party. So I got to see alllllll of my family. But that was the last time I saw my grandfather. He was sitting in a chair, talking and laughing with all the other old people. I ran up to him and threw my arms around him. "Happy Easter, Daddy Sam!" I said. "Happy Easter, Madeline!" he said with a hug back. Then I ran off to talk to some cousins. And those were the last words we said. Why didn't I tell him I loved him? THat's what hurt me so much when he died 9 days later. My dad told me that Daddy Sam was sure he knew I loved him, but why didn't I tell him? Why didn't I sit down and talk to him?   Don't wait till it's too late to tell someone you love them.  *breathes*  Okay, on a lighter note...  EVERYONE: GO TO TJ'S ON SATURDAY! I MEAN IT! I'VE NEVER BEEN AND NEITHER HAS SARA OR ALLIE, AND WE WANNA GO! SO BE THERE OR BE SQUARE! :-P   Seriously, go to TJ's. We're spreading the word around. :-D
