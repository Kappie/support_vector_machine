She allows me to enter a relationship now, but I hope she’ll respect my decision on staying the way I am now. Naturally, there'll be an occasional fleeting thought of romance, but I like the independence, the liberty,  the future’s so unpredictable. While reading the Bible a few days ago, God seemed to be encouraging me to try out the missionary field. Stuff like that can change my entire course of life so it’s best if I’m not leg-shackled to anyone, or vice versa. Yea!        Don't say "I love you" if you don't really care, don't say "For all the days of my life" if commitment's not there.
