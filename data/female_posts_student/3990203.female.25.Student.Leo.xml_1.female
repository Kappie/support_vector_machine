That's the bad thing about living so far from my family, I carnt really be their when I'm needed.  Friend Tammy is coming over tonight to cheer me up. Were going to experiment with the alcohol samples Helen sent over (much appreciated), especially at the mo.  Tomorrow I'm heading out to the highland games if I don't have to rush down to my mums that is.  god what a day !!
