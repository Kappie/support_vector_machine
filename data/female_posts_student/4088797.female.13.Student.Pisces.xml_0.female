Well I was too stupid to think of using a razor blade(and I don't know if I even have one). So I used knives which didn't cut very deep. Since it wasn't working, I went on the Internet to and looked it up. Then I read this blog making fun of people who mutilate themselves. That's when I remembered that cutting is for people who want attention. I admit that I wanted the attention. At least to some extent anyway. Well at least I wasn't bored for awhile there.          I wrote that in my journal. My mom is trying to read it, so I need to find a hiding place. Why are parents so damn nosy? Well now the cuts are practically gone and no one noticed. The only person who would really care was my mom. MJ would tell me it was stupid. And I agree. I'm not the type of person who would mutilate themselves for attention. Now I'm just like every other depressive teenager out there. Yippee.         July 27,2004 6:40 PM           I still like Orion. Maybe even more than I used to. Oh well. That's life. I realized it when he came over again. It was a shock really. I forgot about him for a long time. I'll get over it again. I did after we broke up.           My life is pathetic. I don't even care anymore. It won't get better, or worse. But it will change. Change is something I know will happen, so in a way it's reliable.           I hate change, but it's comforting too. If I don't like how things, I know they'll change. Some people say that things change for the better or the worse. I think it just depends on how you look at it.          I still think that life is just what you make of it. But maybe some people don't have the ability to look on the good side of things. I think that sometimes I lose the ability to look at the good side.
