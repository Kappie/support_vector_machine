Back in the Dark Ages of the previous century, namely the fifties, people used to drink out of bottles that were made entirely out of glass. At least, I think so. It's rather hard to select a useful wad of information out of the nearly never-ending stream of inane bullshit that flows out of an old person's mouth. But I'm almost certain that in between heavy bouts of grim nagging about kids these days, immigrants and the weather, I picked up something along the lines of, "In my day, we drank out of glass. Not like you lazy kids these days, always drinking out of plastic. Now, in my day, we didn't do that. In my day, we..."  The reason I didn't continue the last sentence, is that I was unable to do so as I was in the middle of passing out from an overdose of slobber and gentle prune wafts that were constantly blown in my face. As I regained consciousness, I recalled the wise, and rather fetid, old man and his incredible tale of an empty glass Coke bottle that faced many dangers but, against all odds, reached its goal, and wiped away a tear that made its way down my cheek. When I moved to get up, I felt something push against my hand and glanced down. There it stood, proud and tall, the old Coke bottle. Awed, I picked it up and cradled it in my arms. Through streaming tears, I looked up at the sky and smiled. "Thank you, stinky old man," I whispered and lifted the bottle up towards the sun, drawing odd looks from passers by, "I will never forget this!"  I often think back to that hot afternoon. The one when the old man gave me, or I violently took it from him, I don't remember these silly details, the empty Coke bottle, and an angry scowl shapes my brow, for the afternoon was scorching hot, and yet, this selfish old fart refused to let me sip from his stupid Coke bottle. I'd love to tell you that the bottle and I remained very good friends, but, alas, I must disappoint you, as I threw it, in a fit of rage, against the curb. I recall its cries, which were all in my head, as I'm apparently nuts, for help as I clutched it tightly against my bosom and whispered I would meet it in the afterlife before I let it slip quietly from my grasp. Ah, the good old days, I say!
