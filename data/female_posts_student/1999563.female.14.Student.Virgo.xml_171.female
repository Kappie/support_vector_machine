Did i tell you Taylor and I are quiting school? Hahaa. We are starting a homeschooling club! Yes! I wonder if the sheriff would like to join our club, I will have to ask him.  THE AARON UPDATE (Just for you, Mandy) Today....We had to do these hall of fame things (I am currently wining for most stylish!! Whats with that? I am not stylish...haha) and Katie and Lauren made Aaron vote for me for nicest. Haha. So I know I have at least 6 votes for niceest!  Ha ha  Uh oh. My brother is stealing the computer.  I will finish my story later!  ADIOS!
