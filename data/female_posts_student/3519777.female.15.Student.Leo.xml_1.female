It was surprisingly small, I thought that I was going to be playing infront of like 100's of people, but there was maybe fifty people there. At Karen's house we chilled n Dan and Wally came over. That left me on Heather's bed to sleep. I hope I find someone some day.. soon damnit. lol. I do have someone in mind, but i dont know if it's gonna happen. Oh, and no its not Phil, Luke or Randy or anyone you may know of... they live out of this town. I hate this town. So anyway.  Tuesday night my grandparents came. So far we havent really done much except "chilled". Well they have seen some people whom they are related to that live up here. Tommorow we're suppose to have a barbeque but I dont know who is coming. My brother came over today to see them, but they went to see some family and they wont be back until about eight.   Oh, at Karen and Heather's house I bought a soft "Angel" pink purse, a  Playboy  necklace and a LAZER... omg.. those things are so much fun.. lol. I love blinding people with it... muah hah hah! Did that sound saitanic? lol. I'm just messin. Anyway, I got to go. Talk to you later.
