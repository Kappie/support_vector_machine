Maybe when I become president I can change that, even though I don't think the president would have much control over that.  Oh well, executive orders......  As mentioned, there is no school today thanks to the snow storm dammit.  Now the elementary kids have a FIVE DAY weekend, while we slave away at school.  NOT FAIR!!  If you get a chance, go pick up a copy of US Weekly.  It's great!!  Bye bye!!
