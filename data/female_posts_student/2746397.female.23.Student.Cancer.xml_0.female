If you need the number you can email me.  My parents have dial up internet too, so I'm not sure how many posts there will be.  I'm getting pretty excited with only a week left till we leave.  More and more details are coming together, and they seem to reveal more.  I'm sure I'll spend the first hour of the flight reviewing things I forgot to bring.  Oh Laura!  I think almost what is more exciting than the traveling is having the whole team together again.  We have a habit of laughing a lot.  So I'm looking forward to more memories than I'll be able to handle.
