It was glorious - the water was cool, but oh so refreshing, and when we came upon Crystal's favourite swimming spot, there was not a soul in sight... soooo nice, just us, the sunshine, and the water. But then, 2 minutes later a rather large group of people ambled down the path... sigh, so much for solitude - but what can you expect from such a divine swimming place? After swimming up the river aways and watching some boys jump off cliffs into the water (yikes - i just keep picturing my cousin with his lacerated spleen from landing badly off a 30 foot cliff a couple weeks ago), we swam back an prepared ourselves for some much needed sunbathing. (well that only lasted for a little while until we had to break open the food bag and munch for a while - mmmm more good food like samosas and veggies and trail mix, and crystal's homemade candied ginger, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies!) It was a wicked way to spend the day. When we arrived home, it was time to check out some of the summer olympics - rowing and gymnastics to be specific (those gymnists can do some crazy shit i tell you). Then my good friend Oona came over and we got ready to go dancing at Steamers Pub where Velvet plays dance music with some funk every sunday night. Good times were had. All in all I'd have to say it was a pretty stellar day, obviously (sorry, but that's been the word of the day). :) But sweet dreams are awaiting me, and my eyelids are going on strike.... p.s. Happy Birthday Grandma!
