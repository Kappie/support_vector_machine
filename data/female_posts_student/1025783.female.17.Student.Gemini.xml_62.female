They had started less than a month ago, always getting more and more realistic. Always the same girl, beautiful and regal with eyes brimming with sorrow. Always the crying and pleas for help. Kaela twisted her long blue ponytail around her finger, tighter and tigher until her finger turned red. Lost in thought she groaned as she heard the bell ring in the distance. Kaela scooped up her bag and sprinted home, narrowly missing students heading home after a long day of school. She used her key to get in, and was nearly knocked over by her oversized labrador. "Hey, you damn mutt" she said affectionately, patting his head and scratching him under his chin. She strode into the kitchen, dropping her bag on a chair and peering at a note tacked on the food projector. Her mother was in Reno again, with that new boyfriend of hers, Sam or Cam or something. Kaela sighed and walked quietly into the living room, switching on the monitor and flopping onto the couch. Cartoons displayed around her head, playing hologrpahic images beating each other senseless. Kaela closed her eyes, lulled by the afternoon heat.  She was back, in that world with her. Kaela opened her eyes and stretched her limbs yawning and looking around. "Please" said a voice quietly. "Please, you must help us Kaela," She strode out from the shadow of a tall building, beautiful and elegant. Kaela turned to look at her, and found she could talk. "Where am I?" She asked slowly, still sleepy and confused. "I've brought you here," The girl said quietly, "I don't know how long you will stay this time, but you're here and you must help." Kaela eyed the girl and her surroundings. She seemed out of place, for her setting was a dreary alleyway, complete with fog and crowded, dirty homes. "What do you want from me?" asked Kaela suspiciously. "It's your time," The girl said as she strode forward. Her hand slid into Kaelas, and the world began to melt, "It's time for you to meet your destiny."
