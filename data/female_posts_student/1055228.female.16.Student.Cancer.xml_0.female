The strength to push down harder, Just wasn't really there. She wasn't very sure, But honestly didn't care. She thought no-one would miss her, Notice they would not. But little to her knowledge, She would never be forgot. People were all amazed, All her family could do is cry. Everyone felt bad, Her friends just wondered why. Teachers were confused, Her bullies all felt bad. If they were only nicer, Now they really wish they had    **The Girl** She’s the girl every one wanted She’s the girl that I could never have She’s the one that made my heart beat faster But why?   Was  she the girl for me….  When I starred into her eyes My whole world seemed to disappear….  When I held her hand Everything seemed so clear  When she smiled at me 	 It was nothing but bliss…  Do you remember …  Remember that day  It was just you and me Everything turned out great Just as expected to be  It was so unclear  Those moments we had.. I don’t know why…  But now I can see…  I don’t know why  I thought  you were so great I don’t know why I thought you could ever want someone like me I don’t know why I thought  We could ever be together Its something that’s so unclear to me  We are so alike in many ways Yet we seem to grow apart every single day I don’t know what I could do or say… To make you trust me To make you believe that Im only wishing for the best  I look back at one night..  And I don’t know why  it had to end like this.. The pain I felt inside was something indescribable  But for some reason I didn’t care Because I was with you  I only wish you could trust me.. And Id like you to know that I would never do you wrong I would never lie or do you harm…  But I don’t know… I don’t know if you’re the girl for me? Because right now Everything is unclear to me
