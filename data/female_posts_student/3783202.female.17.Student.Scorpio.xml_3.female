Earlier, Jesse and I go down to Sweet 98 to get the V.I.P. parking pass, which I couldn't get because they said that it was too late to pick up, which kinda sucked, because we spent almost an hour and a half, going down there, getting lost for 20 minutes, not knowing where to go. So like I told Jesse, I was like I think, no I know he's dating this girl and I will seriously be COMPLETELY and udderly totally pissed off if she comes. I said there will seriously be words going on and I will and come find you. I wouldn't have said anything to her excpet good luck with him, because she didn't do anything, but I would definetly well at him. Like seriously that's not cool, and he deliberatly lied to me. I've asked him repeatedly if their dating, atleast so I wouldn't be led on anymore, and get over him, and not care.   So I was kinda gettin worried becuase it was almost 4 and was on the phone to my dad just bitching on and on at how he hadn't called and I was gettin ready to call Jesse and go with him and I get off the phone and my phone voicemail song is playing so he called..finally, and left a voicemail,and so he said he'd come about 6:30 or somethin. So I'm gettin ready and brushin my teeth and puttin straightenin my hair and puttin on make-up..DON'T ask me why, I honestly have no idea why i was getting ready. So he calls and is like I'm coming and I was like HOLY SHIT. So he shows up..with Zane and Brent Brewer(guess who got to sit by him..heh), mom gets home, or so I thought, Thomas is at the door, phone is ringin, cell phone is ringing and I'm like ahhhh OH MY GOD!!!!!! I was so overwhelmed I could have cried. Since their are 2 Brent's...it will have to be Brent(Brewer), and Brent( B-flem)   So we go and get Becky and Emily and their friend Dorie(hmmm makes you wonder) so we go down to.....Borders and were waiting for Noah and Ross, because we were going to go smoke with them. It was one of my ohhh okay moments, where you smile, nod and go along with it. So they come, and we don't have anywhere to go. So Noah calls Bill, Bill says we can go to his house and chill, his mom is there, his mom....smokes with us..weird you may ask...HMMMM I THINK SO! But whatever. So we're all sittin around and I'm just sittin there, and I'm just chillin, and I'm sitting between B-Flem and Zane, and he just is sittin there laughin, and I mean like almost on the floor laughin, and I look over at Brent, and he's just like wtf. So like 5 minutes later, he's still laughing, so I kinda start and then Brent starts and Noah is just like what the hell is so funny. So, we leave.   And we park on like 50th and something so we have to walk, so Brent and I were like it's 8, let's run so we don't miss anything. So we take off running, and we're runnin, and runnin and still runnin, and run a red light, almost get hit, and keep on runnin.Great fun. Great fun.   We get there and lose everyone, meaning B-Flem, Zane, Tristan, and Z. So then we meet up with them again and walk to go watch and we end up in the back, and Brent was like hell no I'm goin up there, so we mosey and push our way up to the front. "Other" Brent went into the mosh pit and B-Flem and I chilled until we found Tristan, Zane and Z. And then me Tristan and B-Flem pushed our way into the mosh pit. There...all hell broke loose. People everywhere jumpin around and pushin and shovin and crowd surfin, by far one of the best concerts ever. So they tried to crowd surf Z and he got 3 feet and fell face first, and got a concusion. So me, Tristan and B-Flem make our way into the mosh pit. FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN! We lost Brent and B-Flem and Tristan held onto me the entire time, because I told him that if he lost me I would kill him. The concert kicked ass!!
