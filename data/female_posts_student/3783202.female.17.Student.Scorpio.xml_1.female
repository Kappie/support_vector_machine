So, I'm going to try to remember what I had written down on my other "blog" since I can't get to my other one......Remembering, that sounds to be quite hard....He left for Germany, and I miss him. He came over to my house the day before he left, and seriously it's not that I don't mind him coming over, because I don't at all. But I know I get bored being there, so I have to think that he does, but he still comes, and then we usually end up walking, for a while.He is so much fun. He's one of the few people who can acutally make me laugh....and I mean laugh, laugh. He is such an amazing person. He tried to teach my sister and Anna how to juggle, honestly now, how adorable is that? One day he is going to be such a wonderful dad. He is just such a good person. I seem to be more calm after I'm around him....Kinda weird, I know. But, whatever works, right? So my little sister, God love her. Although I thought I was going to kill her. She had asked me a couple days before if I could marry anyone from our school who would it be and she goes would it be Colby? And I said no, Colby is down and all I just wouldn't, because it's well....Colby. It would be like being with Abby(AKA the hott kid's sister). So, I told her Brent. And the one person she wasn't supposed to tell, Brent, she does. Oh my God, I just sat there. But...I played cool, I took it like a man. I was like yeah, I said that, and he said something to the affect of now I'm gonna have to workout or something, I don't remember word for word. Was that what he said, I don't really remember. But, I just kinda sat there and thought Why....I was kinda confused. But anyways, after our walk around the neighborhood, and when I say around, we went around my  ENTIRE  neighborhood. We came back and sat on my porch, and he kept looking at me, and it was funny, He was like don't you feel weird when your like across the room or something and you know someone is watching you and you feel all creeped out? I was like yeah, you're doing a good job. So then, he was getting ready to go eat with his family(One of my "Aw" moments of the day) and he was like I'm going to miss you, that's why I kept looking at you. And I mean SERIOUSLY you can't say anything better than that. My heart just  COMPLETELY  MELTED when he said that. I was just like OH MY GOD, I LOVE U!!! I seriously didn't know whether to smile or cry. And then Stacey enters my mind, and I think how do you I know he's not saying this to her, or if their together, why would he say something like that, and then I start feeling EXTREMELY GUILTY  because I'm like it's none of my business, we're not together(although God knows I wish) but, still I have no right to think that or to be jealous. It's a waste of time, that end up consuming me for the rest of the day. I'm going to miss him a whole lot. Not talking to him for those like 4 or 5 days almost drove me crazy, what am I going to do for 2 weeks, keep listening to the voice mails he left.He hugged me....multiple times before he left, he even  got to his car and then came back to hug me again. I told him that he better leave before I started to cry. And, I was fighting it as he was standing there and I know he had to of know I was going to. So I just waited until he left. And then I cried. So then there I go again wondering if she's doing the exact same thing. Missing him....I hate thinking about things like that becuase try as hard as I can to get it out of my head it doesn't leave.  WHY DO I KEEP THINKING THIS????? When I walked into the baseball game and I saw her there with his family. My heart sank, I wanted to cry and then I thought, I really did lose him. He's with her and all he and I are ever going to be is friends, now mind you this happened all before Friday night. When Robyn and I went to Panera. I just took a lucky guess that he would be working. And sure enough he was, I was really excited to see him, I couldn't stop smiling, even though I had yet to talk to him. I think I scared him. i was like ps ps ps. And he saw me and kinda jumped back, I was like ohhhh Helllllloooo! So then he came and hugged me and we talked, and it was fine again. He said he almost cried tears of joy, after seeing me, I was like aw. lol.  I miss him....have I mentioned this already?  LOLOL, I watched the news to make sure no planes crashed.now I know there is a VERY VERY VERY small chance that his plane would crash, but...still I dreamed it 3 different times, I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay. I keep distracting myself.  Sometimes I have to wonder why I keep doing this, Why I talk to him and hang out for a few days and then may not hear from him because he's probably with Stacey and then I go and get all jealous again, and then he calls and it all seems to go away, because even for a second I forget about everything when I'm with him.  I normally wouldn't spend this much time on a guy I knew I didn't have a chance with, but there's something about him that I can't let go of. He told me that he felt something between us, and I think that I might have too. Prom had to be one of the best times (without Alex) that I've had. It was so much fun, and it was because of him. He saved me. We just danced and danced and laughed and laughed. And nothing has changed since then, we still laugh and laugh...and dance....every now and then. LOL! We're dancing buddies, we established this at Ball's grad. parrrrty. When I'm with him I have the best time and I cannot stop smiling. He makes me giggle, and no one has been able to make me giggle that much since I was with Matt, almost 2 years ago. I want him and it sucks Leslie had this quote in her info and I stole it said, "I just wanted you to know I love the way you laugh and inside it's tearing me apart." I love his laugh, it just makes me smile, you just have to laugh too! Okay, I'm tired and have been at this for a while... I just saw this in Thompson's profile about his girlfriend..."If I had to choose between you and the world I'd choose the world and give it to you." Golly Goodness, how adorable is that....Sorry I just thought that I would share...Sweet Dreams
