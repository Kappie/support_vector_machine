Lots has happened... and if you are reading this you mostly likely already know what I'm talking about.  So no need for me to go on now is there?  Thanksgiving was great.  For all those ppl who hate going to see grandparents everytime there's a holiday, or being forced to spend time with annoying family members all the time, you don't realize how good you have it!  I got to see cousins that i havn't seen for 2 years or more!  The saddest thing is that, because MK and I are the oldest, most of our cousins hardly know us.  My second cousins (i think second once removed or somthing weird like that) are just like me and my sister.  Katherine is a 6 grader and reminds me SO MUCH of me, while her little sister Rebecca who is in the 4th grade, is basically Mary Katherine's personality double.  So it was very nice to see family that we've lost touch with.    The only bad thing about this week.. is my voice... or lack there of.  I have a fever and I sound like a frog, when you can hear anything at all that is.  It wouldn't really be that big of a deal to me--sick, stay home, get better go back-- but my voice recital is saturday and recovery of my voice by that time isn't looking so promising.  I wonder if it's in my subconscious, b/c i got strep throat the day before my recital back in the 5th grade.  oh me oh my.  Oh well... Que Sera Sera
