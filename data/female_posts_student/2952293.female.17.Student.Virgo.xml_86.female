I saw Harry Potter for the third time today. He is just so cute. Plus, he's only turning 15 this July. That's just great. I'm 17 and I'm freakishly attracted to a 14 year old. We took my dog on a walk today. He found a package of hot dogs and brought it home. It was this kid's fishing bait...oops. Then I went down to the Ohio Democratic Headquarters to get some tickets for John Kerry tomorrow. This really adorable boy was working, he was COMPLETELY frazzled. This woman asked for like 50 tickets! There was a little brown man in a "John Kerry for President 2004" t-shirt and he had all this paperwork which said he was apart of something for John Kerry. Go little man, go! I got some tickets and then we had a little conversation: Me: "Do you have any volunteer opportunities?" Him: "Well, no not me personally." I don't know if he was being friendly or evil. He had good emo-boy hair. Nice nice.
