We got our yearbooks wendsday, and they look really good. Had a few people sign them today, but not a lot. Most of the teachers say they'll take them away if they see the books out in class, thier gunna give us the last day of school to sign them. Speaking of the last day, it's only 5 days away, the last day is a minimum day...so I'm excited.  Summer polo starts next monday, at the Armijo pool...but whatever, Its still going to be great. (The armijo pool is small, dirty, lots of chlorine, and sort of salty tasting) I didn't know that I'd miss waterpolo so much, and it only makes me happier that I joined in the first place. Angela's worried about her goalie possition, but no fear, I'm sure she'll still be awesome...even if wayne makes her play the field.  Becca and Me have been pretty okay. There have been a few small disagreements, but nothing major...no screaming or hitting or any of that nonsence.  Strangly, I'm in a good mood. I still have to get a job, I'm sort of running out of time...which sucks ass, but whatever. I have to start caring about things...whatevers sort of my motto now...not a good sign. At least the school year's almost over, so this 'whatever' phase wont do too much damage on my grades. I forgot to sign up for SAT's...that sucks ass too, by the way.
