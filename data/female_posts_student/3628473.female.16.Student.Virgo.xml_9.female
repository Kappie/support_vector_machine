What to do? I have cleaned every part of the house, nothing left. So what do i do now? go over to my best friends... Dont want to stay inside. What to do! I am really boreing person to tell the truth, its not like yal' didn't know that in the first place. Shannon called me to talk for a while. And i kind of didn't say anything. I didn't talk. I couldn't. I had no clue what to talk about... The same with Katie. once say what needs to be said, we are done. man i suck at friendships. My sister and i can say or do whatever, its fine. But out side my family. What to do about this?  i have another thing on my mind. Theres a boy. There always is... This boy and I have a weird relationship. And if it was anyone else but me in this relationship, like another girl. They would forget this boy and never think about him again. But as for me. I dont know what it is... Is it cause there is no one else around... no, thats not it. Cause every single time, even when there is another in my life, i drop everything for this guy.But now he isn't talking to me. Duh, thats cause he doesn't want to be with you Cassy... I'm not stupid, i know these things. But why can i let it go till he tells me...This is sooo upseting.
