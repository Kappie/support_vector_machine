I was so tired and probably could have slept for longer if my stupid brother and his friend Ryan weren't yelling downstairs. Like holy crap, don't they realize that some people are sleeping at 2 in the afternoon! I was about to throw something, but then I figured I probably wouldn't be able to go back to sleep anyways.       I have a new found obbsession with "Eels". They are THE greatest band "That's Not Really Funny" is the greatest song : D. So now, thanks to my brother once again, I have to turn my music up SUPER loud so I can hear over, "What's up mah nigga, Shut up nigga!" But I guess this is the price I have to pay for being born into the wrong family.       Well,  Amy's gone to her trailer for the week, Kylie is babysitting, Laura's mom scares me and all of my other "peeps" are most likely busy. Hm. That leaves me left with nothing to do. If only I had money, I could buy people to hang out with. Or at least something interesting to do. Like a trampoline - alone or not, it's ALWAYS fun.
