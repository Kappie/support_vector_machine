So if anyone wants to save me from being alone every Tuesday until like August that would be the greatest.   Today - My Dad hasn't called yet. Big suprise there. He is such a big disappointment in my life. Everyone who has a father figure in their lives don't realize how lucky you truely are, even if you don't like him, he is still there for you. I see my dad once about every 3 months. I know to some people I seem lucky for that, but a father is supposed to care and want to see his kids. The occasional dinner here or day at his house there or a birthday card with money in it every year just isn't enough for me anymore. Kids need a father figure in their life just as much as they need a mother. You don't have any idea how much it hurts me when I invite him to a concert or a field hockey or basketball game and he says he'll be there and he never shows up. Yeah, I say I hate him, but that's just so people don't see how much it hurts me not to have him in my life.  Tomorrow is the first part of the English regents. I'm nervous about it. I just want about an 85 on it and I'll be happy.  Today I'm doing nothing...again. Maybe I'll ask my mom to go shopping so I can buy Laura a b-day present for her party on Tuesday.  Oh, the other day I finally ordered a new pair of sneakers. I got them on sale from Delia's for $25! They are Vans and they're blue with a yellow and a white stripe thing. I can't wait for them to come!  Listening to: [Any Number Can Play by No Use For A Name]  They will mislead you, plug in and bleed you I swear I heard the DJ say "Swallow temptation", believe the answer Is in the order you obey  I know my purpose isn't on a poster sign I'm still part of the game that any number can play  Majority vote, identity? No! Top forty reasons to spoon feed Immunity lost, full price at your cost Industry living by disease  Imagine, idolize and idealize A dream a nighmare couldn't change Any number can play  The sound remains unclear, There's little left to hear except contradiction Looks like somebody made our mind When history repeats the hit that I've heard for my whole life  Bring back request to radio, Your favorite song was written but you'll never know A selection for us to see a blind conspiracy Another version of the imitated tune and not one soul was saved Any number can play
