(not that you'll actually want to steal it...)   you called me from the deserted payphone, and told me about the gun in your hand. you expected me to feel sorry for you- even after everything you had done to me. the words ‘i’m so fucking sorry’ slipped from your lips with such ease- with such sincerity. why do i always give into you? maybe it’s the sound of your voice; maybe it’s the way my veins run dry when i’m not with you. i thought that maybe if we were together, then nothing could ever hurt me. but it was being with you that hurt me most- the cuts and bruises on my heart show that. but no matter how many times you batter and destroy me, I still manage to find my way back to you. ‘pull the fucking trigger’ are the only words i can find to say. and as i hear the gunshot on the other end of the receiver, the bullet goes through your heart and out through mine- ending this love forever.    -copyright, kate mckenna.  and there you have it. i hope you like it...cuz i sure do. and so do sofija and lana... so eff you if you don't.  ack tomorrow's canada day! sweet. i haven't been out of the house with my friends for  days . it shall be sweet...note to self: take money and camera. woot.  oh wow. waterwings is the best video ever...it's so sweet. and, if i haven't already mentioned this before, alexisonfire is my all time favourite band. (i've come a long way from despising them a couple of months ago.)  well, i'm out. paice.  embrace the emptiness. so let it enfold you.  kayte.  p.s. i'm sorry for my blogs sucking/being short just recently. they will get better, i promise. i just need to get some friends.
