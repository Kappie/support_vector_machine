My mother had a habit of complaining and kept saying that all tutuion teachers are always like that. They would be punctual for the first few lessons and then arrive very very late... (example above...) Now I am trying to do 1 blog for each day and not talk about exams. I think it is jinxed if I tell all my exams here online. Therefore, I decided to shut my mouth *ZIP* and face the day happily, of course, it is not true as I am having my exam period..... : ( Why the school will not cancel the exams.... *boo hoo*
