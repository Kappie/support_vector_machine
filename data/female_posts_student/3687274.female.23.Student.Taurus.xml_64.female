Like...well, I don't really know what. But something. Last year, they had sorority thingamabobs handing out fliers...but I don't want to be in a sorority. Not really my thing. I'm trying to find people to work for me on Friday and Saturday because I'm scheduled to work at Gilligan's. And to all I haven't told, (that's, what, two of you) I will be at Gilligan's on Saturday after I'm done working. So, people should come up and hang out. Directions: Exit the freeway onto National going east. I know the way I take I get off on some side street and I have to take a right at the first stop sign, then a right at the stop and go light (National) then I'm on National. So, just get to National and take it to Barclay, then take a right on Barclay.  The club is in a warehouse looking creature, it's on the left hand side and it says RAIN in front. Gilligan's is the patio bar attached to rain. I think Barclay is the first street east of 1st street. So, even if you take 1st st. just go east at the 1st and National intersection. So, be there or be square. Or beware. Or something. Just be there. Back to reality. I hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my life, i hate my job, the stupid boy still hasn't called and I've given up hope of ever dating again, i hate my job, i hate my job, i have to do my hair, i hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my job, i hate my job, i have to buy khakis, i hate my job, i have to paint my nails, i hate my job. I bought film and I'm going to take pictures really soon and try to have a couple up between posts so there is always something interesting for people to look at. Like poop.
