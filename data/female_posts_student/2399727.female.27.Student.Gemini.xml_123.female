I'm glad; I would have had to kill him if he reneged after all of the food and kitchenware I bought just for his visit!  When he rang, I was laying out cookies, crackers and cheese.  Got the utensils cleaned up and just have to boil the kettle and slice the carrot cake when he actually shows up.  Whew.  I hate entertaining... we'll have to see if my little proposal to him goes over well or if he laughs in my face.  I can be pretty persuasive but this is a long shot.  P.P. gave me a good opener though so fingers crossed...   Turned my laundry pink this morning.  I have never, ever done that before and I am quite peeved that I did it now.  I was sure that I had washed the hell out of my maroon table cover enough that it wouldn't bleed, but obviously I was mistaken.  So, second load is in (the pink didn't come out, btw) and will be folded in a few minutes.  Thank goodness I didn't opt to wash any of my good clothes with it - just sheets and towels.  MGSA meeting tonight at 7 followed by a social.  What a crappy time.  Don't they know it's Survivor night, American Idol results night and finale night for The Apprentice?  (sigh)  Did a little work on my diss. proposal biblio.  Started putting it alphabetically by category rather than just one big lump of titles.  The dryer is calling me.    More to come...
