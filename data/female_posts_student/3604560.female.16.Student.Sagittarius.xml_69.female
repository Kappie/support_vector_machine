I don't care how fantastic Tarantino is, Kill Bill was a flop, and for good reason. You're not marrying Ioan, I'll make sure of it.  Yay! Who won State of Origin? WE DID! And was Freddie fantastic or was Freddie fantastic? Fitzy was good too, but I had this annoying guy behind me who kept whinging about Minichiello all through the first half, and then in the second when Minichiello was getting really good he's like saying that he was just starting to redeem himself. I'd like to see him try, that 60-year-old loser...  Mel, I think they were prolly just called 'random-hard-rolled-oats-goldensyrup-and-coconut-biscuits' or something. I got this from the Australian War Memorial site:  "The army biscuit, also known as an ANZAC Wafer or an ANZAC Tile, is essentially a hardtack biscuit, a long shelf-life biscuit substitute for bread. Unlike bread though, the biscuits are very, very hard. Some soldiers preferred to grind them up and use them as porridge. (Add water and sugar, cook, serve with generous dollop of jam.)"  Hey doobies, got to:  urlLink PROGRAMAS MSN THINGY . Don't worry that it's not in English, you don't need words except the ones on the program thing. It makes goofy avatar pics. I don't know if you can save them or something, I just go Printsrceen and cut it to the site I want in Paint. Anyways, it's cool. There's also one that makes emoticons, but they're not as cool. It's the link up top on the left that says 'Creacion Emoticons'. See, I know another language!  Nyergh. Nearly the end of the first week of holidays and I've done none of my homework. Typical.  Divz: "I know never to play with fire again but only fire that resides in the hearts of my many male lovers!!!!" Nyerny?  Toodles
