However, I was creepily attracted to the goth boy, Cooper. Maybe its just my identifiying with another middle child, but he has a sort of underage sexiness going on. Weird. I can't wait to see what happens next week. And how weird would it be to find out you are pregnant at the same time as your daughter? I'm hoping she has an abortion, I can't imagine dealing with a kid while in high school.
