I would have had a big six-person tent, had it not been for my aunt janet, uncle paul, and cousin kevin. they stole our big tentes, love. they stole it from us! so instead I had a small backpacking tent. still sufficient. it reminded me of the dark places I like to sit in back at school. my props closet corner. my piano garage. under tables. you know, those places. small and dark.       I spent almost all of my time in this tent. usually i would try to at least be social with my outer-family, but last time uncle paul came to visit us, he tied all of my stuffed animals nooses and proceeded to hang them from my cieling whilst my slumber was deep. i awoke to find fluffy and misfit, among other childhood friends, with x's for eyes and drooping limbs. so i stayed in my tent and read  the unbearable lightness of being  like a good IB student.      "An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the rest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to do with talent, which goes deeper than talent, no one can become an actor" (193) i read. interesting. then i thought (even though i am not an actor, and am hopefully not considered as one, since the reputation held by such is quite hilarious to those who reside in the dark places of theater) what moves people to exhibit themselves for a bunch of people they don't even know? is it the basic fact that they want everyone to know who they are? that they want to walk down the street and have people say "hey, i know you, you're that actor" or have theater highschoolers buy a broadway cast recording with their voice on it, and have that impressionable youth think "this is the best actor ever" even though they have never met? when they were little did they see an actor who was amazing, and thus planted the seeds of actor in their own heart? or is there some other driving force?      as a sepparate aspect of theater, i begin to wonder what drives me to do what i do. although the concept of  becoming  somone else and  becoming  a written part has fascinated me from a very early age, i chose a different path.       think of any actor you personally know. one of those people you consider to  really  be an actor. now think about them more closely. they seem fake, unreal. always acting some other part that isn't them, don't they? you may wonder who that real person is. or if, since at such a young age, they decided this path for themselves, if all that that person really is is a collection of characters. yes, he or she in an incredibly amazing actor. yes, he or she is an incredibly amazing person. but the real question is, are they simply acting like an incredibly amazing person?      it's a funny thing. i sometimes wonder if any of them are actual people. but then again, maybe we are all collections of characters being acted out. perhaps the character of emily is my own portrayl of characters i've collected from books, movies, shows, everything, since i was born. and other people certainly add their characters to the mass that is the character of emily. even after i'm off and gone from this part of the world, character emily will still have compiled character linden, character andrea, character taylor, and character lauren into herself.       so if every person is a compilation of characters, and all of those characters are compliations of characters, what then is who you "really are?"       which, in a round-about way, brings me to another point. if every day we all go around, not knowing what's going to happen next, why aren't we all better at improv? why are some people so terrible at it?      back to what i wasy saying. was i even saying it before? i don't really remeber. OH! how would i make that passage about a techie, i asked myself, sitting in my tent. i couldn't think of an answer. then i thought, if actors are driven by the rush of millions of people knowing who they are, watching them, what is a techie driven by? tech certainly does not do the job for recognition, but there certainly is passion for the art involved in technical theater. i personally like using the tools, and watching someone i know very well become someone completely different on stage. i like to watch how it changed their own character. and, of course, i like the dark. but that's not really why i do it. it's because it's fun, and i like it. tech may not have so much glamour, but we get to be in the dark and talk about morbid things and play with power tools. and i get fun props. and there really is a great sense of pride when voices of the night comes out on stage, and you realize that if you hadn't stayed for countless hours after school aiming those lights and spiking that stage, there woudln't be light on the freshman faces. or you realize that there would be, but it would have taken linden, laureland andrea alot longer to do it. or alot shorter. either way, they wouldn't have had as much fun.       and when actors all go out and act like other people in their big groups together, techies go out and build snowmen. in the dark. or turn on trippy shit and lie on stage. or write a musical mocking actors. or go to a park and say "1...2...3..." and fall over. or buy pet rats. or make board games about different ways to kill people in the auditorium. or break into mass choir songs four hours after school ends while pulling spike tape off the stage because the actor went spike-tape crazy. or play lazor tag on prom night. or go camping just because there's nothing better to do.      it then becomes a question of why anyone would WANT to be an actor when they could be a techie and participate in all of the dark techie things. some actors might say "if i was a techie, i couldn't be in GTC." but they'd be wrong, because i'm a techie, i did all the requirements, which is more than most of the members can say, and i'm sure as hell in it. some might say "then i won't be in the spotlight" and they would be right. but you know what, tech doesn't need egotistical assholes like you. go be an actor so we can make fun of you.      thus passes emily's first blog entry.
