I've become slightly desensitized.   So let's see, what's new now? Dunno. I've managed to probably avoid failing U.S. History...MAYBE. In anycase, here's a toast to caring for the first time. I haven't been doing much recently, not really. Stuff in general that is. Kinda boring, and odd that I find it boring, I used to not get bored.  Ok, now I've GOT to say something. Our school's Admin.'s been harrassing teachers they have a personal problem against, trying to out 'em unfairly, playing dirty. For freedom, and just plain justice, we can't let such things happen, especially when these teachers are great people. The Admin. is just a stupid moronic group of people, led by a fascist, power mad dictator, entitled "principal." Being a beliver in the word of Punk, I can't help but having a problem with this. If there's a way to support these teachers (who will remain anonymous over this webpage), I will find away to join in. I can't stand idly by, ignorance and dirty tricks like this can't be allowed to continue. It's completely unfair and just wrong and hurtful. I strongly encourage you guys to consider this too, the Admin.'s been all over us for shit, and the teachers try to help us out, risking themselves. Now let's help them out, for being to kind.
