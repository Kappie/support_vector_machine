Maybe they do romance courses at college.  *ponders* I should be romantic and thoughtful and all roses and love and hearts and shiney things, but I must have missed obtaining that gene, take after mother then.  "Loaded, I've loaded up this gun, there's a killer in me, hoping you're the one, but you always run away when I come around, I dont mind the day, I'll track you down, and TERRIFY"  Liking that song at the moment, a lot.  Suave voice, for a guy that is.  Seeta has a suave voice, she has a gig on saturday however Im not going.  My plans for this weekend so far: Friday - nothing Saturday - nothing Sunday - KD come here (no choice) and stay over Monday - "period pains" No school.  Apart from that I have work, but not too much, so Im worried about the amount I will get next year when we have to rush through the course, not that I am complaining!  Holiday in 2 weeks and 3 days!  whooo. JD
