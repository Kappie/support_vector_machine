Well, see, it used to be on the computer, so we were all very well and happy, and somewhere in this time period the cd went poof.  BUT THEN the computer crashed ergo loss of installed programs cause we had to delete stuff to make it non-virused or whatever.  But then when it got all better, no photoshop and we could not find the cd ANYWHERE.  OH NOOOOOOOO.  What to do??!?!?!?  Anyhow, the cd got found.  Hah, I can use passive voice if i damn well feel like it.  MAKE ME STOP.  Long and short of this story being that it's reinstalled and I am consequently joyous.  If you're still reading this, I love you.  Though some people may be pulled in by the attractiveness of my CAPITALIZED letters. LOVE ME.  SEND ME CASH.  I wonder if that works.  hn.  anyhow...   um, arcana kicks ass.  go read it.  http://arcana.keenspace.com/d/20020205.html  “…Each of these mirrors is like a window to your memories.
