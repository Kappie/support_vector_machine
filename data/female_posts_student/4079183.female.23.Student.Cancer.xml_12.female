We have decided to hold off until we move in our house though, that way we will be situated, have enough room, and we wont have to move with me pregnant.  I am sure that there are people in my family that will not be happy about this since I almost died from the last baby, the hospitals stupidity.  I am an adult after all and dont beleive that anyone elses opinion should matter anyways (family member).
