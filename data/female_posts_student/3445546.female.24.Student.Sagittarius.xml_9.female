WRONG!  honestly, i get there, early, fill out several forms all wanting random information that i am not entirely sure of, thus i end up being creative and making some of it up, which i have conflicted feelings about, but whatever.  moving on, i fill out the complicated forms, using my creative genius.  then i wait.  and wait.  and wait.  a long time mind you.  long enough to drink a venti soy extra hot no water chai.  and to read sixty five pages in my current book.  then i get called back.  and once i am back there, things move just as slowly.  they consult my chart.  note that i have high blood pressure and kidney issues (still unclear about those, but again, whatever).  note that i have a consent form from a nephrologist that i have never actually seen yet, but again, whatever.  they take my blood pressure, noting that while it is indeed lower than last time, it is still high, almost too high to give me the shot.  so, they tell me to take several deep breaths and to calm down.  picture yourself in a serene spot.  uh huh...my serene spot at that time included me with a gaggle of children surrounding me all whining and crying due to my lack of birth control.    right, so let me get this straight.  you want me to relax.  to calm down.  but yet, you are telling me that i might not be able to get the damn shot which i want so that i don't have any small children in the near future?!  right, well, no pressure there.  honestly.  anyhow, after three more readings of the blood pressure, i think the nurse fudged it to the doctor, sympathizing with me greatly, ensuring that i could get the shot and not reproduce for awhile.  i really appreciated this, given that my anxiety was only increasing with the repeated blood pressure tests.  anyhow, after such an ordeal, i was finally allowed the treat of getting a shot squarely in my arse (the book i am reading is by an english author...the use of arse is a shout out to that...almost used blimey, but i am unsure of the actual meaning, whereas arse i understand), which hurt quite a bit.    and just to make things so much better, the silly doctor informed me, just after she stuck me with the needle, that i need to be wary of weight gain on this particular method of birth control...agh!  i already run and work out, but now that i have to be even more careful, i will be all that more neurotic and obsessive.  hence the four mile hilly and hot run i went on as soon as i got home from the doctor's office.  i might be insane.  it is possible.  on unrelated fronts, the pistons won!  yeah!  i followed the tournament games pretty closely, and really enjoyed them.  watched the final one down in some totally desolate bar in sister lakes with gabe, but had a great time.  it was pretty much just him, me, and a couple of his buddies, drinking and watching the game.  and again, i have reconfirmed that the medicine for the blood pressure greatly hinders my drinking tolerance, rendering me wasted in about half the time.  ha, lucky gabe for having to deal with wasted me.  he does well though, must be all that experience with small foreign children...has given him good amounts of patience and a good ability to make peanut butter toast.  anyhow, fun times.  and now i feel the need to do some napping, due to the compulsive exercise.
