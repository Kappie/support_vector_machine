Lunchtime was a bit better, because I'd brought in my Ouija board all of us sat there in Mr Runhams room contacting spirits, probably looking like right idiots. We got in contact with two different people, one was called Jean, and the other was a person with a name I can't pronounce. Both didn't say much and disappeared pretty quickly. I think it was because of all the distractions and non-believers in the room with us at the time.  Last lesson was the raffle, good prizes including a bike, dvd player, portable tv, and loads of other cool stuff like that. Of course I had to have my name called out!!! My hair was frizzy, I'm sure I went bright red, and I was in a bad mood for being cramped up in a small space for so long! Got to the front to collect my prize only to realize there was no good prizes left! Pissed off and wanting to sit down again, I wandered to the back of all the people who were all standing at the front. Finally after what seemed like ages, the bell rang and we were all free to go. I escaped having my picture taken with the rest of the winners and ran over to say goodbye to my friends.  Later on, at 5 o'clock, Dee and I went to see Spiderman 2. It was quite good, the highlight of my day! Went after the film to Macdonalds, Dee had a happy meal and I waited for my mum to pick me up.   Boring day, should've stayed at home is my final conclusion. If only I was picked from the raffle sooner so I could've got a dvd player!
