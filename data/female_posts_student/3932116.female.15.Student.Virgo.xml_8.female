It's great. we even made peanut butter cookies tonite (well, actually, i made the cookies..jess ate the dough) but it was great. it's such a relief. Jess did tell me that i was right, so i could refrain from i told u so, which was a good thing. now dan is having probs...he doesn't know what he wants, but like n e of us do. actually i do. i want someone i can talk to and they can make me laugh. seriously, that's it. i don't know. it seems like i'm not gonna find n e one soon..or n e one willing to comply. but it's ok, i'm in high school...i don't need to worry about that right now. right now i just need to worry about getting into the University of Illinois.
