I feel like G-d has failed me and that I have failed G-d.  It occurred to me that I really don't have any spirituality; I know the stories, I know some of the laws, but that does not comfort me...There needs to be something more.  I am thinking about going to Rabbi Herman for answers, and I know that some people think its brain washing, but I really don't care.  I need something, I just don't know what.  I sat tonight staring at two pictures in the same room of men I didn't know.  One was a framed photograph of Zayde from his twenties; the other, reality.  How does one come to terms with something when they don't recognize what is fact and what is fiction?
