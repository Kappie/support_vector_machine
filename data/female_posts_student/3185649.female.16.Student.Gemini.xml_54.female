I used to like him, but I'm not sure now because I lost somethings in Costa Rica, and I don't feel very sure about anything anymore.  Anyway, another friend of mine kind of likes him. It's hard because, I'm not sure if I like him (because I kinda like a guy in Costa Rica) and if that was enough to think about I have to consider this friend and how she would feel if anything happened between me and this guy. I talked to my dad about it, because you know i tell him everything, and he was like "well let me commend you for your loyalty to ----"  But it's hard. Because I really do like this guy, at least I would consider him one of my best friends and I could see myself dating him. I also really like his family, I love his parents, no matter how much he says his mom is anti-social. But I still like this guy in Costa Rica (stupid I know because nothing is going to happen but still).  And it's so tiring always trying to make sure that everyone is happy. I have to date someone that I could actually date (which rules out my other best guy friend cause we fight so much) and at the same time it should be someone my parents know, and trust, and it has to be someone that I could drag to hang out with my friends at church and school, and this guy fits all that. But I can't date him because my friend likes him. And I know it's not like she owns him or something, but still, I can't just date a guy my friend likes. How weird is that? How inconsiderate?  But I am really tired of being sure everyone else is happy before serving my own desires. I know I have to be a servant, because that's what God calls us to do, serve others. But sometimes, I just don't want to do it.  But, I don't know why I'm thinking about this, he hasn't asked me out or anything.
