Thats really something. And it was also raining. But it was the rain which turned my lovely day sour. It so happened that today our bus was parked in that street , thats right before ppc. Anyhow, just to avoid the stupid water which was trickling from the bus's rooftop, I decided to move a bit towards the wretched ditch. And lo! and behold I fell right into the ditch. Yuck!. Yeah, I know it is pretty hilarious for all of you there, but I felt sick. I knew if I tried to climb up, I would go deeper , so I shouted for Shantanu,a class XI friend of mine. He helped me up, but by that time it was so slippery, that if he wouldnt have clung to the bus, we would have both gone down. A real terrible experience. The bad luck continued. For all of the lucky people who were sitting in their home enjoying the rain, the scene on the roads was really pathetic. I had to go to Fiitjee, and was caught in a big traffic jam. It was already 3:30, and ultimately, I got down from the car near the IIT flyover and walked to Laxman Public School where I spent another 4 hrs trying to get fluids into my head.Sad plight. No I dont mind walking, if I know I am not getting late. But when its past my class time, i get very tense. So Friday, the 13th turned out to be unlucky for me. (I know for quite a few peple it was wonderful, like Bhavya who won the first prize at Fr. Agnels. Congratulations, though they looked really funny in those sunglasses.).   I would just want to wish Monroe a very   HAPPY BIRTHDAY   from my side.  P.S. Please do not write anonymous comments, its PLAIN BUGGING.
