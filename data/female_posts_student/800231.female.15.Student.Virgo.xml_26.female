Anyway, enough of that.  Helen, Lucia and I were at Eckstein this afternoon to help with tutoring. Mildly fun, in a school sort of way. Saw this kid walk out of the band room cuddling and kissing a tiny puppy. Made me realize that not everyone sucks arse there. Thank god.  Steph's whole issue with her parents has been sorted out, she was really the one at fault there. She called the police on people that were only trying to help her. Typico.  Alice and Steph coming back from Mexico tonight, something to look forward to.  Tired, need to write 842 culminating projects. Well 3, but still. I'd rather sleep.  Helen called a bit ago and we ended up watching "Wheel of Fortune" together and guessing the answers over the phone. We are such losers.  loveliness. :)
