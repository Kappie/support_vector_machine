Today.. let's see all that happened was that I (Asia) woke up around 1:00.. because the phone was ringing off of the wall! (Heather and Jennifer call TOO early!!) Ohk, well at 2:00 we went to the elks and we got back at my house around 8:00.. then we went over to Paxton's.. again. Played Halo. Pretty cool! Anyways.. Only Jennifer can spend the night, cause her mom is cool. LOL j/k, so I just think that Heather and Yaya's parents are weird.. but the have stupid GOLF in the morning. Party poopers!! Ahaha..So me and Jennifer can just party and have fun without them! So right now, it's 9:30 or something, i think. Paxton just asked me out.. :-/...! I am saying no. Anyways.. next subject. Now I think that Pax is mad at me.. sux.
