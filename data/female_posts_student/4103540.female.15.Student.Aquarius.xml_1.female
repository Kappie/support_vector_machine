I have brown hair, brown eyes, not short, not tall, not thin, not fat...I'm absolutely nothing really...Doesn't make my outlook on life look very positive does it? At GCSE I'm taking Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Statistics, English Language, English Literature, ICT, Music, Geography, Spanish, 1/2 course RE, 1/2 course Graphics. I took my Maths in November of year 10 (Almost 2 years early) and passed with an A. My one real love is music though. Whether it's performing, listening or composing, I love it all. I'm going to use this space to post some of my favourite song lyrics from time to time. Whether they're ones that are particularly relevant to me or just songs I remember from growing up. Performing has led me to have a rather eclectic taste in music, I don't care what I perform but I'm more picky about what I listen to. I'll happily sing Vivaldi's Gloria but I'll always be listening to Alanis Morissette, Keane, RHCP, Goo Goo Dolls etc etc. I sing with Hampshire County Youth Choir, possibly the favourite aspect of my life. It's one of the key things that makes me not want to grow up, when I go off to university, another 3 years away, I'll have to leave. I'll probably end up writing a lot about choir, I love singing... I also play piano, violin and classical guitar. I've been playing guitar since I was about 5, it was fine at first but as you grow up you want to escape the confines of classical music. Not that I have anything against classical music but at about 13 you just want to take everything out on it, play all those angst-ridden songs...So I quit my lessons and haven't touched a guitar in about a year. It's a shame because after 8 years you get quite good but hey, that's life. Anyway, I'm going to go now and plan what songs to introduce you to first. See you later...
