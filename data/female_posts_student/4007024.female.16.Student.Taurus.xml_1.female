AHHH! i'm going to crack down this week and weekend though... so watch out ;-)        dude school is sooner than i thought.. but i'm totally excited for junoir year.. i think it's going to be GREAT! it will be freaking awesome if all our junoir girls could get along instead of being split up into 2 groups which is freaking retarded. and it's not cool when people talk about you for doing something and then they turn around and do it. damn hypocrites. (( dude i totally just had teretts just now.. b/c that anger just came out)) i just want everyone to get along and hang out with everyone and stop being selfish. that's just what i think. :-D        i think i'm going to visit kevin carter in lafayette tomorrow woohoo! he's my buddy.. i haven't hung out with him in forever and i'm excited. and wemight go hang out with my friend christi from there.. she's cool as shit. and i haven't seen her in AGES!        nap time... later.
