Or is he just some freak who lies?? And I got ANOTHER email from some other freak who asked me if 'I don't got no money??'  Sup wit these peeps?????????  haha.  Strange.  Maybe I should reply and say, "You better watch your back, I work for the CIA."  heheheh.  I think I will....  muahahaha  Give those people a taste of their own medicine.  And then I'll block them, so the can't send me back mean replies.  hehehe.  What do you all think of that???
