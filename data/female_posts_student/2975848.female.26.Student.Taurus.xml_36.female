    
       
       You left  I knew you would leave me somehow In a unforgettable day You took away my heart Broken in a thousand pieces Some how I knew Deep inside We were not meant to be Though I gave you all All I was All I had Now thrown away To forgotten I wish I never love again Cause I still feel the pain Since you got away!
