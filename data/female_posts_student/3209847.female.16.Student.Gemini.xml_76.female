I over analyzed three of them so I messed up but still managed to get a B, and that is just fine with me. I'm happy with that! Whatever! Its over, done with, no mas. hehe.   After that I went to my Doctor's appointment and it was good. You know.. as good as doctor's appointments can be! haha. 9:45 though, so early =)  My mom picked me up and took me to sarah's house where we hung out for about an hour and then SHE had to go to a Doctor's appointment. Doctor's appointment day, haha.   We saw Spiderman 2 after that. It was good. Was it as good as the first one? Maybe. It was just downright depressing most of the time. It made you want to just give up and walk out. I swear I think I have ADD because I want to keep switching the subject but I need to stay on Spiderman 2. Yeah, you should go see it, but it wasn't TOO great.  After Spiderman 2, Sarah and I went back to her house and hung out for 40 minutes until we had to go back to my house. Such a crazy day, I know. We only had 40 minutes to get me ready for my audition at 7. Wow that sounded selfish, but I took a shower, dried my hair, found my music, and everything in 40 minutes. I'd say it was pretty good! The audition went well. It was at Theater Arlington for The Music Man. Neato..  So we came back to my house after that, ordered pizza, played Scene It! with my brother, and talked to him for a while. He's such a cool guy. Sarah and I also watched Thirteen. Has anyone seen it? We both thought it was really good, but very very heavy. We were both just drained after we watched it. It was good though, I HIGHLY recommend that!   Well that's basically all for now. I'm sorry that its kind of short. I have to get up in 6 hours  bye Sarah!
