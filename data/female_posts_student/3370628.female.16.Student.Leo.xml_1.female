Trying to get some pet line art that I coloured for a business I co-manage to be auctioned off... If I can sell it for my auto-buy (12k) I'm more than set, heh. As is, I have yet to get a single bidder, which makes me wonder if they're just not as cute as they seem (actually Taylor is scared of them, so maybe that is the case ^.^'), or if I'm just a really crappy saleswoman. After all, one of the other co-managers was able to auction off three at once... Then again, they were all ones that she'd coloured. Meh. Lucky blighter has a tablet.  School went all right. Finished filming  The Faketrix  in Drama, and ended up including an unscripted bit of dancing on my part, eheh heh. In the original script that Taylor wrote, it was supposed to be that the Operator runs in to find the crew of the  Abracadabra  playing charades. Seeing as we only had four actors (though technically I'm actor/co-director/co-producer/costumes/co-editor), we couldn't really simulate a crew particularly well, so instead she runs in to find me doing the cha-cha on my lonesome, all dressed up in black with the trench coat and sunglasses and everything. *sweatdrop* Ah, well. 'Tis supposed to be satirical, and at least I didn't have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat and pretend to be dancing to steel drums. Bwahaha. Poor Eric. I feel sorry for him. Honest.  Music... Well, I'm pouty about music on the one hand, as we went to the Media Arts lab to do some more work on our project rather than continue with the alternate instruments thing. On the other hand, I actually completed one of the seven or so parts I have to separate and write out.   English... We're studying Media, so the teacher brought in  Home Improvement  for us to watch and analyze. So, yeah, actually a good English class...  Soc.. Teacher wasn't there, had a sub, I did some of the work left, but spent a majority of the period writing an opening post for an RP. I didn't finish it, though, as when I started on the second part of it, an argument about why churches have to spend so much money on making their roofs high and awe-inspiring flared up all around me, so I couldn't concentrate. Yeah. Have one atheist sitting beside me, another behind her, had a Christian sitting behind me, and then the sub spurring things on in general. Being a good little pending Wiccan, I kept my mouth shut, heh.  Whoo! Bidder on Gaia, just as I was closing the auction... Never fails, hehe.
