Me and Tyler and Kathy and Will are walking around the school - this is about 4:30 ish - anyway we're in the parking lot and yea I see the ME Lazerte Van sitting in the parking lot. So I'm like -"Hey! That's the ME Lazerte Van!" and then my mind jumps to Nick! Haha! And yea I was thinking -man if he played soccer that would mean that he'd be here. Yea! Anyway I was like "I said I'd phone him..."  So yea me being me and this is  Nick  we're talking about man. Anyway I decide that I want to Phone him! Anyway I have his number on my cell phone because well come on think about it... Haha! So I dial it up and you know what I get? A  BUSY  signal! Haha!! Yea so I kind of didn't phone him for fear or the Busy signal again...  Anyway I'm talking to him (right now too) and yea he's like "I phoned you but you weren't home" and here I am I was like " hey I phoned you and you were busy" and I have caller id so I go ID his call ... He phoned at about 4:40 ish...  I phoned at about 4:40ish - which means that we phoned each other at the same time! Haha! What a coincidence hey? Yea... That's my story.. Bye now!
