I volunteered today at school and stupidly wore high heels which killed because I was given a job as a runner which meant I took the printed ID cards to the last station to be picked up by the freshman when they were done with everything.  I watched Office Space over at Joannes which reminded me of work tomorrow. I feel like that place is sucking the soul right out of me. I am wasting my life in a cubicle. Bright and cheery thought for tomorrow. haha. Well good night kiddies  Catie--the blog thing doesn't type every letter, any suggestions? I know its not my keyboard because it types fine with im's. Thanks hun!
