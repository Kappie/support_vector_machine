I want to care more about how I look (okay- that sounds too weird- I just want to look nice), make new friends, possibly get a boyfriend, and just have a lot of fun. People always seem to have gotten the wrong impression of me, and I want my "image" to change. I want to be seen as loud, individual, fun to be around, but also at the same time intelligent and caring of others. I know I'm already seen as that by my close circle of friends, but that's just it-- only a few know the real me. Others see me differently. Way differently.   We're playing Geneva tonight at their courts. I don't want to play them! My record thus far this year is a measly 2-2. I don't want a 2-3, because that would just be too pathetic. I know I don't deserve to be third singles. Yes, I worked hard, but Deirda or Catherine could easily beat me, and they are only playing first doubles...the spot I should really be playing. But oh well, I'm here and I am working my best at it, hopefully so the Bragga's can think that it was a good move on their behalf to put me there in the first place.
