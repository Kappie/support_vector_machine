I am in the silliest of moods, having just spent the last half an hour exchanging insults with my favorite coworker and eating semi-rotten cherries from a plastic container.  Also read the local liberal rag that comes out of KC, The Pitch Weekly.  Mostly I shamelessly go for the romance classifieds and the horoscopes and the sex column.  (Dan Savage is one of my heroes.)  But this time, I read the whole thing, possibly because the idea of reading Dostoyevsky wasn't as appealing as I thought it would be when I put it in my backpack last night.  When I have to start teaching, I am going to start using a briefcase.  Backpacks to Briefcases, that's the KU motto.  Like it's some kind of vocational school.  Like most of us don't move back in with our folks and spend 40 hours a week in 'cubes.  Anyway, I am going to get a briefcase, but on the first day of class, when there are 27 pairs of eyes looking at me, I am probably going to open it up and vomit in it.    Vomit, which rather reminds me of our Lord Jesus...Yes, Eddie Izzard is one of my heroes as well, recently introduced to me by my roommate and boyfriend.    My boyfriend.  Now there's a topic that I can't seem to exhaust.  He makes me want to pick flowers.  Oh, but there is something I have yet to address, and that has nothing whatsoever to do with flowers...  One thing about the holiday I took with my man was that we were in such close company for so long that the last vestiges of anything hidden about myself and my life completely evaporated.  Sure, I have my hidden thoughts and that solitary part of myself that nobody sees, the writer part of myself, the things I couldn't and wouldn't ever try to explain.  But tell you what, I really laid myself as open as can be.  For one thing, whatever remnants of feminine mystique I had been clinging to--Gone after my man witnessed me eat a chili smothered hot dog as big as my forearm.  The term "riotous dump" was coined that day.  And, though I'm sure he's known it for a while now, I told him I loved him.  God I wish I had not said that while I was intoxicated.  I wish, in some regards, that I had not said it at all.   I meant it, and I am confident he can't burn out my heart any more now than he ever could have just because I finally broke down and said it.  But those are some mighty words.  Mighty words.  Fourteen minutes left, and I will be fancy free until tomorrow.  One thing about taking a bunch of time off work is that the weeks seem mercifully short.  Today is Hump Day (which also reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus).  I have to start working on school because it will be over soon.  How in the hell is the time flying by so fast?  In spite of how grossly the minutes stretch out while I am here in this dingy vault plugging away at this keyboard, generally this summer has gone by in overdrive.  In less than a month, I will be in Santa Cruz.  In less that two months, I will be in graduate school.    In October, I will turn twenty-four.  Now there is a sobering thought.  I remember celebrating my husband's twenty-fourth birthday.  I had just turned twenty-one.  Our birthdays were a day apart.  I played "Old Man" by Neil Young (24 and there's so much more).  I used to think he was the paragon of wisdom, world weary old twenty-four.  God it's scary, being an adult.  You realize that nobody is really running this show, that every adult you think of as responsibly holding the reigns of society is just a kid who grew up.    I tease my man that he will have to buy me a four-footed cane and whip up Metamucil shakes for me.  Man I am so obnoxious.  I act like he's such a baby, when in all reality, I will probably outlive him.  Isn't that awful, how women always stick around forever and ever, accumulating cats and getting battier with every year?    I haven't filled these last few minutes, but that is probably rather a good thing.
