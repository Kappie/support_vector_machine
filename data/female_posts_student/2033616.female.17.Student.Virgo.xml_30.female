It felt like a sunday all day and i almost felt like before the day even started, my free day was over-- but it was still nice to get a break for a day, get some sleep and relax.  Well well well well.. hhmmmm... other people have also surprised me lately.  Who would have known?  I realize that i am being very vauge... that might be annoying.. i apologize.  However i can't share what is REALLY on my mind lately, now with the whole world anyhow.  I should start driving more often... apparantly "that's a good time to think" says Chad  I'm going to Sara Hagen's for a cell group tonight, that should be fun b/c i havn't seen her in a couple of months, and katie geoff and josh are there so it should be a blast.  Homework is calling.
