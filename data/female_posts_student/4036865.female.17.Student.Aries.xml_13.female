Lol, it was alright, and i painted figurines with Kyle's little sister, Kaiden, must say, i actually had fun. Then i took a really long bath and totally relaxed. By then, i was already feeling pretty nervous,  i did my hair, and then did my make-up, and finally got dressed, i was ahead of time by like 15 minutes, so i laid in bed. i was feeling really nervous by then, but, it was good, he introduced himself to my parents, and then we went to dinner. It took forever to get a table, and the waiting was no good, we talked, which is always nice, finally we sat down and ordered, and while we waited, i kept the converstation going. He seemed to be satisfied to listen to me ramble on, and i had a lot of fun, the food was really good, and then we went for a walk, i hate misquitos, that sucked, but other then that, even that was great, the park was beautiful. Then we just sat in the truck and talked. Which is probably one of my favorite parts of the night, i like just talking, being totally open and honest. Yes, all in all, it was wonderful. But this entry is getting pretty boring to write. GTG
