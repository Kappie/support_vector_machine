I spent the morning and early afternoon sitting on a pier by the water, reading "prayer for owen meany".  I am nearly through with it, and i must say, not a bad book.  it was good to smell the salt water (even though it IS the LI sound).  chatted with a very kind old man who was out for a walk.  he sat near me to rest and struck up a conversation.  he was such a gentleman, and so sweet.  i bet his grandchildren love him.  now I am posting this blog in the library on a public computer, and trying to figure out how to get home.  this will be so much easier when i can finally drive in october.  though connecticut has some total crap law about not being allowed to drive past 9pm until 17 or so.     i think i'll go see "Mean Girls" this afternoon.
