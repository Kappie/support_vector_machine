The first day in two weeks that I come to first period we get out early. Awesome stuff, huh?  The cicadas are out and about now. They are not bad yet... But walking into the house I saw an area no bigger than a square foot that had at least 8 shells attached to the grass there, and I nearly stepped on two cicadas. ..These aren't the ones that are normally around here. These ones seem a bit shorter in length and have red eyes, not green ones. Their red eyes creep me out... Nothing with red eyes is ever harmless... Creepy little things they are...
