Three guesses. He has effectively found a way to take money away from the schools who need it most. No Child Left Behind... unless they can't afford it.  So do well on the EOGs, guys. Our teachers need us.  (A little aside: they're starting a Charter school in Watauga for "gifted" children. That means all the rich white kids. Which means the other schools' averages will go down. Which means even less money for them! Also a form of segregation: upper class kids away from lower class kids. This way they will be totally unprepared for the real world. Of course! It's brilliant!)  I tend to be sarcastic when I'm angry.
