This is not something insignificant.  This actually is the biggest e-mail of my life and I want to make sure it is worded right.  I got to talk to papa about a lot of stuff, mostly military ramblings and I guess a lot of thoughts run paralell to his...but I am more open minded I think.  I met wonderful people today, people that will be embedded in my memory for years to come.  Here is a quote from the callendar my sister gave me:   "Timing is the key to life.  We cannot correct and edit a report until it is written.  When someone is having a bad day, it may not be a good time to "clear up" and issue that has been hanging around."    I don't know what is going on in the lives of my friends but I think that this quote is true and that timing is truly everything.  It is with my greatest hope that things are going well for them and that life has been kind to them.  How do you find a lost friend that does not want to be found?
