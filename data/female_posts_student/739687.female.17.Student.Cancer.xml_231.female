I've just been thinking about why some people feel this need to impress everyone. It's like they're different around everyone just so they can fit in. It's annoying, and it's fake.  I hate fakes.  But I just don't get how people can change their opinions so easily to conform with what someone else thinks. Or how they model their opinions so that everyone can see how godly, intelligent, and moral they are. You know what I think?  Who cares!  I feel that if you feel the need to prove morality and intelligence to someone, then maybe you're just trying to fool yourself.   So why don't you just go dig a hole, climb in, and prove yourself to the dirt. It's obviously got more substance than you do.   Rants. Must love rants. I feel like ranting alot. But I'm kinda sad about stuff, and when things get me down, I tend to rant in this broad, generalized fashion.  Sometimes, things really suck. And escaping your problems doesn't fix that. And it's too bad I haven't learned that yet. See, I could preach to people that escaping your problems won't make them go away, but I know that I don't take that advice. I'm still off looking for ways to make my problems magically disappear or just clear up, without ever really facing them.  And so what? It's a learning process. Everything in life is a learning process.  You have to break every rule before you can truly enforce it.  That's my theory at least. I think that doing otherwise is narrow-minded.  Yeah, maybe I'll eventually figure out how to deal with things better.   I just hate when everything you want seems so far out of reach.   Well, crazies, that's enough ranting for today. Adios.
