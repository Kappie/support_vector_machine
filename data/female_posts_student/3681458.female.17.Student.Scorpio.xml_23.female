Speaking of man enough, I've had some recent doubts about Ben.  Megan and I were talking last night.  I have been asked by more than one friend if he was gay.  It never really occured to me.  But as Megan said, hindsight is 20/20.  I think it could be true. Let me list the facts: 1.) I was hardly ever kissed.  I had to be the one to make the first move. (which I fucking hate) 2.) He never let me see him cum. (I don't know if this is that big of a deal) 3.) He only had girl friends, and his guy friend is Quinton.  4.) He was very concerned with how he dressed. 5.) He was scared of my parents, and definently wasn't a man about it. He acted like a girl.  Well there's my summed up list.  I have more, but don't really want to list them all.  I also had a huge list going of all the things he did that annoyed me.  I am not even upset about it being over.  I miss the company, but not the person.  That is so sad to say, and I hate writing it.  I don't really know why I was with him.  I just ignored the things he did that bothered me.  Granted, I know that I won't meet a perfect person, but there has to be some things I like about them.  I read his journal now, and don't really know who that person is.  He has changed so much.  He swears now, and never did that before.  Almsot like he had a separate identity around me.  So sad, I could have dated so many other people too.  Who definently weren't gay, who would have treated me right, and who I am friends with now and they don't get on my nerves.  I feel like I wasted my time, but I am happy to move on, and I can't wait to see what will happen.  In the meantime, I wait it out.  I will flirt with whoever I want.  I will date casually.   That is all for now.  Going to a movie with Jared.
