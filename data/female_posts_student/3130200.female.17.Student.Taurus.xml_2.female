If anyone out there in bloggerland doesn't want to read about my relationships (read: lack there of) then skip on ahead to the next paragraph.Ok, I have good relationships with the majority of my family most of the time. I have good relationships with my friends all the time. I have good relationships with members of the opposite sex none of the time. Why? Am I unattractive, undesirable, unapproachable, un...whatever? Am I too intimidating?I can work on that you know. Overall, it just pisses the hell out of me. Why don't I have a boyfriend? I kinda want one, even if he is a work in progress, Im up for the challenge.I want someone to hug me and kiss me and take me to the movies and offer me his jacket when I'm cold. I want a boy. Hell, I might even take a girl...more on that later.   Moving on, I drank a boat load of water today. Actually it was just the recommended servings...64 oz. I spent most of my afternoon running to the toilet because I had to pee. Couldn't get that "Gotta go Gotta go Gotta go Gotta go right now" song out of my head. Thinking I may have an over-active bladder. Will look into it.   The state of Colorado needs to take away my driver's license.Would appropriately consider myself one of the worst drivers to ever drive in the history of driving. Already have 4 points on my license and I've only had it a smidge over a year. Good lord.Oh, to those of you who are reading this (see: she's fooling herself, nobody reads this) who have the grave misfortune of not having a point system in your gret stet I shall enlighten you. One is given a driver's license. At first, one has 6 points allotted on this license until one should turn 18 whereupon one's driver's license achieves a 12 point alotation (is that a word?). If one gets a speeding ticket, one receives 1-2 points against one's license. If one gets in a wreck, on receives 2-4 pointsagainst one's license if wreck was one's fault. If one is being an ass behind the wheel (driving drunk, reckless driving, driving with a suspended license, etc) on receives 2-6 points against one's license. So, one (named Sam) has been in:   1 wreck   1 situation involving a speeding ticket   1 situation involving a warning  Resulting in:   4 total points on one's (Sams) license.  Sam mustn't get into trouble for the next 10 months or sam is in deep shite.
