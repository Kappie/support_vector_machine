Many of my regular hang-outs left campus, for vacation, interns ... etc. First I thought it would be a long lonely summer, w/ me myself being in Cambridge. A bit surprisingly, it turns out that, I met some new people outside of CS (hurray!), and I have been having a lot of fun hanging out with them during the past week.    These people are guys from Taiwan.  They are just so ... Hum ... let me think, how I should put it ... they are just sooo "taiwanese".  Most of my close friends that I have made throughout college are people who either grew up in the U.S., or came from differnt countries other than Taiwan.  Unlike all my other friends that I have made during the past ... well, 8 years living in U.S., they grew up in Taiwan and they remember/absolutely love everything about Taiwan.  We can talk for hours about things like Taiwanese books, Taiwanes Authors, popular Japanses soap that people watch ... it is really awesome.    On the side note ... They have also become my source of Chinese books ... they brought some pretty cool books from Taiwan, which I can't wait to get my hands on them! *excited*  (I told James not to lend them to me yet, otherwise, forget about research and sleep ... I will just read them non-stop ...)
