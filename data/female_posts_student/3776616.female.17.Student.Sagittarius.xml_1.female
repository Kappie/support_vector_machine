I talked to Beth for a little while, but that's about it.  Then around 6:30 my dad dropped me off at Lainie's place of employment, so I hung out there w/ Lainie, Beth, Sarah, Jen, and sarah's lil' sis was there for awhile too.  Sarah, Beth, and I thought it would be fun to stalk the band while they wre out marching, which was quite funny.  Sam and Alex gave us the finger, my sis gave me a dirty look, Hanlon laughed at us, Teagan, Kaylla, and Nick all gave us weird looks, and I believe the rest of the band was just scared b/c we were following them around and 'appearing out of nowhere'  Then after we left Lainie's work we dropped Beth off then Sarah, Jen, and I drove around for awhile.  We went to Sam's to give him his Girlfriend Cookie, but he wasn't home, so then we went to Nick's.  We put a little note on it, went up to his door, rand the doorbell, then handed it in through the partially open door and ran.  As we wre pulling out of the driveway we could see Nick chasing us down the driveway w/ something in his hand, we weren't really sure what it was.  Then we went to give Alex his, but he was somewhere w/ Teagan, so we didn't.  Then we went to J-ville and wandered around Wal-Mart for a bit, then Sarah dropped me off at 10:00.  And then around 11 I texted Lainie, and we texted for over an hour... Then I went to bed b/c I felt like shit.  Ken never called me, so I guess he must've had to work really late... He said he'd probably just spend the night up at the fireworks store most of this week...  Blah... I might not get to see him again until the 5th, which kinda sucks, but at least the 5th will be a day for just me and him, no distractions.  YAY!!!
