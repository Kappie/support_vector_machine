(awww) then we went on this trail. it was so pretty. then i came home adn did sum hw. then like my mom let me go out with leo again. we went to his house adn tried to watch the 1st season of the chappelle show...but i think i was kinda distracting him. heehee. but it was alright. oooo it was fun.  like he knows where all my weak spots are. like i melt with he kisses my neck. ahhhhhh! i luv it. wink wink
