I've discovered Air isn't a bastard, infact he's a really sweet guy! The other night I was thinking, Tabby's got everything, and what do I have? Nothing but the taste of prawns when I eat Jaffa Cakes...  My exams are finally over, I've got both bad and good results, got an A in Food, 2 B-s in English, an E in science, 23% in maths, oh dear! Lol, I'm dreading my history and r.e, but oh well! Well yeah, lifes been treating me well. And they have blessed me with such great friends, I was just too blind to see it, so heres a huage shout out to the guys that have made my life livable!  Tabby Lettie Len Rik Pig Nips Frankie Kes Luc Corrin Chrystynay Sammy Clur Soggy Deesray and so on...  Lol, well that's all, take care peeps. You know I love you xxxxxxxx
