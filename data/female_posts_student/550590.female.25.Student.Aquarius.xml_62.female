And now it's time for updates from the weekend:  1) It was WONDERFUL to see all the Alumni again.  Nice to know that some things don't change.  Eggers is still spacey, Josh still says "Dude!" and "SHUT UP!" all the time, and Sully is still his adorable self.    2)It was also fun introducing Rebecca to people she already knows.  I'm gonna bleach my hair, get all skinny and start competing for a North Eastern school.  See you all at nationals.  3) The teammates still piss me off...well, most of them.  I just sent off a nasty rant to the list-serv and probably made about 20 enemies in about 10 minutes.  This was months of repressed rage being expelled from my mind...well worth the five minutes of eye rolling and bitching they'll do about me in the long run.  4) judging debate is exhausting.  I judged 6 straight rounds on Saturday.  Competing wasn't nearly as exhausting: At least then I got to move and I didn't have to think of something nice to say about downright wretched performances.  5) God bless Kellie for putting up with all the shit I tried to pull when I was on the team.  I can't imagine how she puts up with the  bullshit now.  When did debate stop being about debate and start being about the weekends off?  Jesus.  I think I'll write again when I have something nice to say...not about the team because then it would probably be a good month or so.  In the meantime I'll go back to thinking sweet thoughts about a tall, dark, handsome man from Tampa.  RAWR.  "So, what team are  you  on?"
