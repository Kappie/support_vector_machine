April said we can do it at her place... (Thanks April) she will send the indications to get there soon.  So bring all the spiritual stuff you have home... I will try to bring a few candles and tea so we can create a relaxing ambiance... You are welcome to bring anything you would like!  See you tomorrow!  Cynthia
