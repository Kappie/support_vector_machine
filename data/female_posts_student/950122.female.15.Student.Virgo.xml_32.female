In fact, I just got back from publishing our Journalism project. 'Tis weird; this morning I was asking myself how I'd get it finished. It was so incomplete, but now it's finished, and it looks coolie. :P Now I only have to worry about my CL project and my Computer project. Hoshi! I'm going to interview you tomorrow! xD
