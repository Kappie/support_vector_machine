Anyway, I'm glad it's back to normal. I told Sod I felt like giving up blogging because of it. I do, however, need to keep up with the set lists. Can't let my fans down. =)  tblog   crap was getting on my nerves.        Yesterday I had a little 'Mormon experience'. I took So and Mo to see their dad, who has a girlfriend and a new baby. See previous post,  urlLink Alexis Maya.  Anyway, I just felt odd sitting there, with him and her and all the kids. I don't know how those women do it, especially if they truly have feelings for the guy. I really can't stand to be around him, and I felt weird. This is where I know I'm strong. Because I can sit with a complete jackass, and behave for the kids sake. Anyone in my position might 'blow the roof off'.  That position is something of great ignorance, and it is something that will never be in this blog.         Somehow  or another I have seemed to pass my Psychology class. This means I can move onto Abnormal Psych. and learn about all the  crazy  ways people act. Actually, it's going to be a lot of reading and writing and me not knowing what the heck is going on. Taking the class on the internet and having the same teacher. Grey is gonna have to ADD IT UP . Doesanyone get that but me? If so, please comment and tell me to  stfu . ha ha.
