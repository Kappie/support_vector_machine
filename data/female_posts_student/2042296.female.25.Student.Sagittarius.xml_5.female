I am so happy! I actually live together with my man... I mean, we've been living together more or less since may, but today it was said out loud for the first time. I can't believe it's true, it's almost too good to be true! But everything has gone so well, and this is also a reasonable thing to do, since apartments in Switzerland are expensive.  This is, however, not just reasonable... Now I'm sure he's serious about our relationship and really wants to be with me.. Not just now, but also in the future. Now I dare to think about things we can do next winter, spring, summer... I dare to plan. I now have a home...  I think I'm in love.
