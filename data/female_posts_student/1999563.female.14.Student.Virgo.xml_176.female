I also sell merchandise. Haha.  I just got back from target. I got my sister  a chirstmas present. I also bought some hallween candy for 9 cents. The candy has been the only thing I have eaten all day so now I feel a little sick. :)  I am going to keep a list of people I see at the shows.  3 O'clock Saturday. 3 People from church, Keary (she rocks!) her sister Amy, and this girl whose name is Britney. My ENGLISH teacher and her BOYFRIEND! Hahha That was a little scary. At least she is really nice. :D    I only saw Elvis  when my mom and I were walking down stairs to talk to Jennifer ( a girl from my school) about singing Matt the birthday song. :)   So yeah.  Now I am going back to the theatre.  Yipppeee! Haha
