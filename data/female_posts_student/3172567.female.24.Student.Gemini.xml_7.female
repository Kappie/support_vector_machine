I've been working at the skate center since 1996, and they just get shittier and shittier every year.   Now, there are some exceptions.  I know this girl named Joan who is 17, and is wise beyond her years.  Joan has a great head on her shoulders, and she doesn't ACT 17.  Most other teenagers blow, though.  Tonight I broke up a fight between a 15 year old boy and a 17 year old boy.  My TKD training is paying off, because I snatched those boys up like they were a couple of puppies fighting over a cheeto.  But they were fighting over garbage.  One of them called the other one of them a bitch in front of a girl or some nonsense like that.  Silliness.  SO, myself and another employee of mine broke the fight up, only to realize no one else was out there with us, and that we had to wade throught the rabble that had encircled us. ("FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!!")  I find out that my adult coworker was just hanging out in the office, and the DJ-or "the bitch" as I like to call her(see first blog post for more info on the bitch)- was chilling out, eating her dinner away from the lights and music controls, which would have been helpful to bust up the crowd.  I  was irritated, because in breaking up said fight, I took a punch to the arm.  I was also irritated because they made me run, and they made me sweat.  SO I snatched the kid up and took him to the office, and went to find the DJbitch to tell her to get back to the DJ booth.  I yelled at her.  I did not mean to, I was flustered and frustrated, so I let her have it, but then I tried to apologize, and she wasn't having it.  She just stomped out the door, and didn't bother to ask me (her boss) if it was okay to leave.  This is why I hate teenagers.  Because if they're not doing dumb shit like fighting over something stupid, they're being disrespectful assholes to their bosses and coworkers.  I need a new job.    ON a lighter note.  I have a new passion* in this world.  It is a band called  urlLink Five Star Iris .  For anyone who has ever been part of the Atlanta/Columbus local music scene, you may remember them as Another Man Down.  This band is truly awesome.  It has been a while since I've been passionate about a band.  The last one was the Dave Matthews Band-until one too many extasy popping teenagers (damned teenagers!!) ruined my Dave experiences.  Anywho...the guys of 5SI are some hard working guys.  They are constantly on the road, because they are trying to make it.  I have made it my personal mission to get the word out about them in Columbus, and I've even bugged the hell out of Rock 103 to get them on the air.  (Which is looking futile, but radio in Columbus is a whole other diatribe.  I'll have to put that in a separate post.)  They've opened for Collective Soul, and Fuel.  They have a Fuel-y-ish sound, except they rock just a bit harder.  They play some originals, which are well written, and catchy.  Its like they're the cover band in my brain.  They played American Girl, (Tom Petty) One, (U2) I Want You to Want Me, (Cheap Trick) and Blister in the Sun, (Violent Femmes) during the second set at the  Loft last Saturday.  I can't say enough about them really.  For anyone who's curious, you can truck on over to the site, which has mp3's.      Nitey nite or good morning!   *and this is not because I think Rob, the bassist is cute .
