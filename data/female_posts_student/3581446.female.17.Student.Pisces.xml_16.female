PASS ON TO THE NEXT ENTRY IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!  ***  I saw the last episode of the second season of Big O for the first time last night...    GWAAARGH!!!   What in the heck were they thinking? I mean, undoubtedly it did answer a few questions and IMO established a few things... Such as Roger being some sort of Jango Fett-esque robotic super soldier built to pilot Big O- and I liked the (percieved) ultimate message that Roger's negotiating skills were his true power, over and above his gadgets and Megaduses (Megadi?). And heck, the ultimate ending, which was an obvious callback to the first episode, had an ethereal, beautiful quality that I enjoyed in its melanchony; but ultimately it recklessly raised so many questions with complete disregard for the audience that I found it endlessly frustrating.   For instance, what the hell happened to Angel and A.R.'s pop? Was there some sort of VR implication going on there? How could angel watch the events transpire on a screen? Where was she, and how did Roger and Dorothy get there? Was Big Ear some sort of robot? What happened forty years ago, anyway?   *sigh* Oh well... -Ian
