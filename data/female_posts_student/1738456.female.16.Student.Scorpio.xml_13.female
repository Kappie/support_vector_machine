It felt much softer than I had imagined it to be. The air around me was warm, and I could feel music in my body picking up. The grass swayed with the breeze, and a tune was playing off the blades. I smiled as I watched the tips turn gold where the wind touched, and then as they turned back to green.   As I walked on, a dance began to build in my toes, and I twirled once, and then twice, and then a third time. No longer was the castle the only thing ahead of me. Right in front of me was a wooden dance floor surrounded by white lights had appeared on top of a small hill dipping not ten feet before the castle. I was sure that it hadn’t been there before I had spun. I froze and stared unblinkingly at the man standing in the middle of the floor dancing by himself to the music I was hearing. I was still clutching my when he turned to face me.  “If you came for the lesson, you need to hurry over here, the ball starts in ten minutes,” his voice rang out strong and husky, and his blonde hair fell around his face not quite long enough to pull away. I suddenly had the feeling in the pit of my stomach that I was four years old, and my face heated.  “Come on,” he reached his hand out, and motioned for me to come closer. I walked over and grabbed it. He laced his fingers in between mine, and pulled me closer. I grew increasingly aware of how close we were, and the intoxicating smell he gave off. I breathed in deeply as we began to move.  His eyes were clear, and the same color of the grass around the floor. His hand moved into the small of my back, and slight pressure there told me I was slouching.  “You are too tense, just relax. Let me lead,” he spun me out and then pulled me back in quickly. Our hips connected tightly, and his hand found my back again.  “How are you so good at this?” I asked feeling like I didn’t need to even reach the castle.  “I practice,” he stared into my eyes, and my knees weakened. He pulled me in tighter to keep me from falling. “You are better than most who come here to learn.” The music was keeping time with my heart speeding up the closer I was to him. Leaning my head on his shoulder, I closed my eyes and imagined staying here. The breeze picked up, and I shivered.  His hand wrapped tighter around my waist. The cold was banished from my body. I picked my head back up, and looked into his eyes again, I forgot time again, and then he leaned in to kiss me. His arms found my shoulders, and then my neck. Time stopped briefly as I imagined the floor sinking away from me.  The music faded. The breeze ran cold through me again. I opened my eyes to an empty field, and a castle to my left. I blinked around me, not expecting the dance floor, or the man to come back. I knew that nothing good would stay around me for long. So, I wrapped my arms around my body again to keep out the cold, and trekked down the hill, feeling truly alone in the pit of my stomach.
