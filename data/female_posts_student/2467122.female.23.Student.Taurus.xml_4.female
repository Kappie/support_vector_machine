The drugs are kicking in and I am getting really sleepy- but I have miles to go before I rest...  DAMN THESE PORTFOLIOS!!!  Just wanted to vent a little.  If you love me then show it!  Oh, well.  I always have Eeyore.  Eeyore would brave the elements... He's the best!  OK- Back to work.  I mean it this time.      ttfn,  *annie*
