Laura permitting? Like fuck they are still going to be together, nearly two weeks for christs sake, there was a bloody time that he was thinking like that about us? Living together? Sharing everything? And now? Now he wants that with her? Surely there is no way they are going to last longer than us, no way, not at all. I won't be able to stand that, it helps to know hes taken, but i want to find myself someone. I also feel like a stalker commenting on him all the time...  ~Lisa~
