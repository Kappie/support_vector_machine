It's something i've learned in the last few months... around some people you just have to show no emotion, no happiness no sadness or look extreamly engaged in something else b/c NO MATTER WHAT i do... it seems to turn against me.  And i'm tired of feeling watched by these people... why do i always worry!  It's not that i worry about what people think of me in the superficial sense... but i worry that they're reading me wrong because i KNOW they're watching me.  Why can't i just be left alone to be me? to be happy when i am, to be upset when i am, if i want to have fun with my friends i darn well can.  on another note... YOU TOOK IT AWAY FROM ME AND IT WASN'T YOURS TO TAKE!!!!!!!!! no it doesn't make sense, but you can just deal with that on your own.
