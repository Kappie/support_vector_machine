       
      A lonely, petit girl, sitting in her room, dressed in casual slacks, like she always did when she had a day off. Her fingers were pounding the black keys of her computer-keyboard, and her eyes were fixed on the screen as she typed away. Little drops of water slid down her forearms, where her wet shower-hair came in contact with it. She raised her right hand, and threw it back, behind her shoulder.  The sound of the birds outside filled the silent room, and the dull breeze was beginning to lower the hot temperature. She’s been sitting there all afternoon, all by herself, like she usually did. She didn’t mind being alone. She kind of enjoyed it, not having to worry about everyone being okay, and not bored, and satisfied. She enjoyed the natural silence, the time by herself, not having to dress up to be someone she wasn’t.  She scratched her eye, and stopped typing for a second, and looked up to listen. There were sirens sounding clear and far away. It was probably an ambulance. She’s never been able to tell the difference. Not that she’d ever tried.
