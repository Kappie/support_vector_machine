Every day at least one of these deeds have come back to haunt me.  "  Remember that girl in Kindergarten?  Alexandra?" " Yes, but i cannot remember her last name.  I am not even sure what her name is.  I had a best friend and we used to play together.  She had flaming long hair.  Alexandra had brown and curly locks.  I cannot remember the name of the girl with orange hair.  It was a beautiful name, i believe it began with an S.  I believe her name was Suzanne." "  How could you?  You made a promise to never forget them when they left the school.  You promised.  You promised.  How could you be so reckless to forget them?"
