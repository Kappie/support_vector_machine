Probably because I was on drugs (legal drugs) so I wouldn't have a panic attack and stop breathing...not that that's happened before or anything...  Anyway, haha, this weekend was pretty fun after A auditions. A auditions weren't even bad. I hung out with people. It was cool. Plus, Alstadt said some pretty nice stuff so, that made me happy.  Anyway, the rest of this weekend, all I really did was work. I went shopping today though! I went to Woodfield! I'd never been there before. It's sooo nice. I bought tons of stuff. :) YaY! I think I'm like...addicted to shopping though. That's not good...  Anyway, I'm off to clean my room then I'm going to sleep uber early tonight...I hope.
