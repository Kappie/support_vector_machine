Matt came and wasn't even miserable until about three hours in, which was nice.  :)  The rest of the weekend was uneventful.  I freaked out a bit yesterday because I realized prelims are only three weeks away and I still have a lot of new reading and reviewing of old topics to do.  But I do think I'll be okay.    I emailed Speth in the hope that he has some new news for me.  As time keeps creeping by, I become less optimistic that I will be able to make something in South Africa work.  Which means I may have to start considering something related to Bob's project for my dissertation...  I feel a bit like I'm in some kind of weird time warp.  I mean, time is going by so fast, and yet things that happened only a short time ago feel like they happened years ago.  Like Meghan's wedding- that was only a month ago, but man.  Seems like ages.  What does that mean?  That a lot has been going on?  That I'm smoking crack?  I dunno....
