After spending 24 freaking hours with Kayla and Christian, I wanted to rest, sleep, have peace and quiet, I was already upset for the most and then they came home with me. So I got yelled at because of my "attitude" and how I was going to get my car taken away, blah blah. That was it, I don't know why, but I just started crying right there, I think after holding everything in for the past month or so I just let it all out. Then of course my mom wants to know what's wrong, like I could really tell her. I mean I told her alot of things that were bothering me, but not all of it. I just told her about how everyone dumps alot of their problems on me, which I don't mind at all, I love to help, but sometimes all of it is too much, plus I'm hardly ever allowed to be/talk with Kiera right now, and that hurts alot, because whenever I need someone she's there and for now she's not. Then alot of it has to do with theatre. I keep getting shut out, I got casted in Arlo's play with the majority of the sophomores instead of being with Rhonda, John, Jimmy, Allison, and Dylan in the other play. And the fact that I don't ever get to show my potential really pisses me off, I don't want to bash anyone or anything, but why why why does Rhonda get all the freaking lead parts?! Seriously, when I get these little sucky parts it really puts me down, like I'm not good enough. Sometimes I just think of dropping out of theatre all together and doing something more practical with my life. But I really want to be famous and do movies and SNL and maybe when an oscar. So I'm going to put on a freaking happy face and go out there and give it all I got, at least that has to be worth something.    I just wanna stay and hold you tight Feels so right no matter what we do I'm just gonna keep on loving you
