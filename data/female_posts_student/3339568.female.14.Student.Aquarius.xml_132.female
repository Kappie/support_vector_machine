This is the pick-up line made up by mi crazy group (well actually kinda mainly me and Gem - hehe) based on the stupid "West Side Story" movie we had 2 watch the otha day. If u don't find it as hilarious as we did, it's becuase it's more of a personal joke, oh and i 'spose we do hav a strange kind of sense of humor, oh and yeh u would kinda hav had 2 see the movie was well! Which i suggest you dont cuz it sucks!! mwhahaha...  I blew off suggestions of me using it. Haha.  I wonder when my friends will get over all the hinting?!   *Mwah*
