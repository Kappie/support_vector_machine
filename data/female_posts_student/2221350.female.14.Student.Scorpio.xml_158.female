I would really like to write a decent post complete with some intimate and depressing details of myself twisted into a quite charming farce of life that couldn't possibly be true. Alas, I am too tired to do anything but say this:  I am finally home. Safe and sound. No more Texas, no more Roseanne, just chillin'. Lauren and Devon had a touching reunion... Rolling around the front yard yelling each other's name. Sometimes I wonder about those two. Of course Lauren is spending the night and OF COURSE they have gone to bed already. Gone to bed... In my goddamn bed. I suppose they didn't think that perhaps I, cait, who has been sleeping on couches/foutons/floors/chairs/in the car/everywhere for the last two weeks might like to sleep in my own bed. it is simply the height of indecency and if I were the type to write a book about manners I would put that in the section of the book called "MAJOR FUCK UPS USUALLY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF A CLOSE FRIEND"   I could wake them up, seeing as I had asked earlier this evening for them to sleep elsewhere so I could enjoy my wonderful bed. But I am a spineless jellyfish who thinks far too much about repercussions of my actions, ultimately accomplishing nothing.  I suppose one more night on the couch won't kill me.  I'll just be pissed when mammaw wakes me up in 3 hours so she can sit in her spot and watch Good Morning America.  really, really pissed.  the only thing that's keeping me from jumping off a bridge is the fact that i've got songs from the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band CD stuck in my head. it's got to be one of the best albums ever made.  My favorite of all time:  Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she’s gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you’re gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.
