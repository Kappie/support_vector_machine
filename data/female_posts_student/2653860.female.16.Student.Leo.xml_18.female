I think you have heard this story already Cassie, so don't read this.  Well our group was at this castle and the girls and I decided to go up to the top of it. What we didn't realize was that there were stairs that you had to climb up and they were really narrow ones at that. Well while we were doing that the guys from my group decided not to do it and stayed outside. Well Tom and Kevin were talking and Kevin said, "Tom, go suck on that." (He was pointing to a drinking fountain that was outside the castle.) Well, just as he turned around to point a lady walked right by him and he poked the lady in the boob. I wasn't there but just hearing about it was hilarious. He tried to say he was sorry. He said it in English and in Spanish. He said that he still wasn't sure if she understood him but it was so funny. Well, that is my story for today. I will tell you more later. B4N
