Last night Devon had a sleep over. 3 kids, Lauren, and me... Needless to say it was horrible. One kid didn't get off the computer until 5am, one kid kept singing "r-e-d red r-e-d red, I can spell red", and one kid kept gluing herself to things. The 3 of them and Lauren ate an entire package of sugar substitute tablets by crushing them and snorting them up their damn noses. Then Lauren called tad who is ty's brother and Valerie loves ty and Lauren told tad and wtf who fucking cares girlies?  I woke up this afternoon to a peturbed mammaw and everyone else had gone. mammaw was pissed because "somebody had taken her sugar tablets and she didn't have any for coffee" well in the most non-incriminating way possible I told her Devon and her friends had been eating them. But when she asked Devon, Devon LIED and everyone covered for her. Well of course mammaw believed me and pretty soon mom and mammaw were arguing about how Devon can get by with ANYTHING because she is the baby is in the house but she is actually a lying little bitch, which led to an argument about how momma is a crazy bitch because of the way mammaw raised her, and how mammaw can't take it anymore, and how everything sucks. Momma stormed out, came back with a new pack of sugar tablets, then left again and has not been back.   Fuck I hate their arguing.  I have a photo of daddy and momma together... They're at my mimics house and they're... Happy. It's my favorite picture in the whole world. It's that one second in time when life was good, frozen, with everything after a clusterfuck. Daddy is handsome and mom is lovely and they're smiling. I looked at the picture for a while today and noticed it has candlewax on it, which pisses me off.  Mom said daddy would call me at 7 o' clock to talk about me coming over for a while. At 8:45 he rang in and launched into a rant about how boring his job was and how stuff wouldn't always be like this and how mompat was doing better and was going on an all vegetarian diet.  I decided something today... I'm a bad egg. I think most of the influences in my life are horrible ones and even though I don't realize they are attacking my brain and when I grow up I will be a horrible person. 2 divorces, 1 addiction, constant fighting, a mistress, and a partridge in a pear tree((goddamn that bird)). All of this goes on... And nobody tells me it's wrong. What am I supposed to think? I know it's wrong, but I ignore it because they're the only family I've got, and it eats me alive.  Having many many small talents makes a much more interesting person than someone with just a few big talents. If you think about it... Mosaics are more beautiful if they have smaller pieces.
