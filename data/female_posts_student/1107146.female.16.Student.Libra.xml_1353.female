We decided to rent costumes and Linds and I were wenches and Josh wore a kilt.  That was great. We kinda wandered around.  Linds and I got a turkey leg, which Rosie saw us eating cause she came over and talked to us (nice meeting you, by the way).  Um...I guess after that we went to the wax hands dude and we did my hand.  Josh thought I was suffering and all....it wasn't bad at all, I have no idea why he thought it was painful.  Um, then we went to the joust which was SUPER fun!  Boy howdy...anyway...after that, I think we just sat down in that grassy area and talked for a really really really long time, during which I became very badly sunburned on my shoulders, which goes to show that off the shoulder is not always the best look.  Oh well.  Then we went out to eat at T.G.I. Friday's.  Dinner was very good.  Thank your mother for me again.   So, yeh.  It really sucks when you have a ton of things to do in the day, but you are done with them by 10:30 in the morning.  Then you get to sit around the house for the rest of the day doing nothing and being incredibly bored.  Until, of course, you call Lindsey and talk to her. Yup, that was my day today.  Don't you wish you had my life?  Oh, yeh, I also get to go out of town this weekend.  Which really sucks. I thought I had made it fairly clear to my parents that I didn't want to go this weekend.  Its a family reunion of sorts.  We're going to someplace in Kentucky.  Man, this weekend is going to suck.  A lot.  Oh well.  It'll be a good time to suck up to my cousin who is working on a movie with some famous director (who he will not to tell me the name).  And, yeh.  Can't wait.  Oh, Josh.  My cousin could possibly be coming to spend some of the summer here, with my grand parents.  He will go insane if he just hangs out with them.  Could you possibly do stuff with him?  I'm kinda worried about how he'll act and what he'll do while here, which is why I need a "good" influence. (Haha).  He's 15, so its not like babysitting or anything.  I would really appreciate it if you would do this and so would the rest of my family.  I might even give you a waxed foot in return.  Boy howdy, what a gift.
