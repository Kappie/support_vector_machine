Morals are something that should be so deeply engrained into your skull that you dont even think about them. And this is only if you have any in the first place. I think our morals are just, as my father says, "A product of your enviroment" you learn them from the people who are around you. You are never taught them.  This summer is letting me think too much. I need another episode of Brendan Leonard.   Its horrible how much people depend on other people. They act like if someone wasnt there ALL the damn time, they might go off the edge or something. I am fine by myself. Maybe it's because I never had anyone here anyways..but I dont really think that would matter. As a basic human instinct you react for yourself...by yourself.  Not have to be right there with your hand being held. I think thats something that has done almost totally away with the human race today. And thats a very sad thing.   I need to go think somemore about a few controversial topics. I will write later. I still need another episode of Brendan Leonard.  I have to go. People cant survive without me.
