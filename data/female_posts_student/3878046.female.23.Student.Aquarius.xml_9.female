	 
      I didn't realise I'd miss you so much
we were only friends
but I felt our souls touch.
Radiant beauty shines out of your heart,
you're a special man
and it's a shame to part.

I'll think of you when I'm far too old,
you have so much potential
burning bright, when I'm dead and cold.
It was only brief,
but I saw that you're gifted
and I'll leave you now,
my heavy soul lifted.
