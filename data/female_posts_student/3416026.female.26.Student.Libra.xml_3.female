I think   urlLink this op-ed by Bob Herbert in the NY Times  is a really straight-foward, concise piece about Al Gore's recent, amazing, forehead-vein-busting vitriol against this administration.  Although I have to admit that I occasionally have trouble separating the real Al Gore from  urlLink the fake Al Gore .
