Started with Martina McBride on the radio.... followed close behind by Big & Rich with Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy) aaaaaaand... then it played Lonestar........ which I didn't really need right now....  Now we're on to Rascal Flatts.... and I think Faith Hill was in there somewhere... blah.....  Country depresses me for some reason.. brings back memories.. makes me think to much.... probably because I can actually make out what the lyrics are saying instead of trying to guess what some guy with long hair and makeup is screaming...  12 days left.... I don't sleep anymore.. chronic nightmares again... Its like I can't escape it... I shut my eyes and I can just see it all playing out in my head again.. even though I wasn't there and only got vague descriptions...  That was the worst phone call of my life..... It makes me appreciate that much more the lack of necessity of the hospital calling after Mom................  10 damn minutes.... 10 damn minutes away...  Ugh I'm going to quit while I'm ahead... or something     A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot
