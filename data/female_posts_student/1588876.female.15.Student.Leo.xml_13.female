Dina got her the phone so se could talk to her mom. she had the phone even after it was hung up, so the off-hook tone was sounding. i grabbed the phone from her to give to dina (at this point, carrie was under the bed).  the parents had to come home early because i just couldn't take it and i was trying real hard not to cry anymore. the parents weren't upset at all at me. in fact, they were so understanding. they think carrie has ADHD. according to them, she does this all the time. i went home and got yelled at by my mom (yet again. nothing new) about not being tough enough. for awhile, i felt as if i had pulled a "Ms. Rose" (Kellogg clasmates know what I'm talking about), until i got yelled at. it just pisses me off how insensitive that bitch can be. she wasn't there. she doesn't know! it was the same old routine- scold, compare me to caroline, send me to bed (at 8:30- whatever!), then bad mouth me to doug and make me look like a mentally retarded B-kid. i can't wait until i move out!!!!!!!!!! my cousin and i have made apct to go on a road trip after we get our own places.   we are the shiznit.
