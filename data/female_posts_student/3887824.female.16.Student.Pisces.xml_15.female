If you want to read my main journal, go here.  http://livejournal.com/users/oracular_echo  I got up a little before 10am this morning for some reason.  I slept for more than 7 hours!  Wow!  lol  Now I'm just sitting, and chatting.  I think I'm going to do some writing, then some school to catch up a little.  I got a letter from Vickie yesterday.  I need to write a couple of letters this week for the pen pal club.  I may be getting a job soon, too.  Well, that's all for now.
