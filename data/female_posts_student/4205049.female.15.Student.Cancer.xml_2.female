Then I saw someone that I hadn't seen since school got out for the summer. She waved, and I waved back...I barely recognized her...she looked really different. I woke up really tired this morning. I almost fell asleep in ROTC, but my acticg flight sargent slammed his hands on the desk and yelled "wake up!" and I was awake for the rest of the period. I decided that I am going to stay in ROTC because it is going to look good on my diploma. I got my uniform in that class. That boy on courtyard...I got the guts to go up to him today. I said "despite the fact that you might hate me and think I am crazy, my friend wants to know your name." and he said "Jason" and I said "ok." and I walked off. I felt so proud of myself. Justin got into trouble for eating in the lobby...it was funny, but Katie said that the guy that said you can't eat in the lobby was just kidding
