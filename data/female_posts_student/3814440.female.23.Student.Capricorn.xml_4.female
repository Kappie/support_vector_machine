I could see her lips moving and her hands gesturing wildly, but I couldn't get my head round the words.   She turned to me, her hair flying and her eyes wild. Her hands were fidgeting now and I could tell she wasn't sure whether she should look at me.Abruptly,she fell to her knees in front of me and grabbed my hand.   "You and I.. This... We're not meant to be together. Can't you see that?"  I looked down at her hands in mine. At that point, all I could think of was that our hands fitted well, with her fairness contrasting my dark tones. And I could feel my head screaming at the inanity of it all.   For a moment,it was quiet. All we could hear were the birds that occasionally flew by and the leaves that rustled gently with the passing breeze. And in that silence, I thought I could feel her softening. Relenting. Maybe it would all be okay.  "Tina..."  Wrenching her hand from me, she got up, screaming.  "Fuck you Fariz! I won't have you manipulating me anymore! You can't! I won't stand for it! I won't!"  The chill came out of nowhere, now creeping up my spine and enveloping my body. Just give her space. She'll cool down. She always does.  "I don't understand,  sayang . What's going on? Why are you so upset with me? Come on, let's be civilised about this.  Mari kita bawak berbincang ."  For a fleeting moment, I could have sworn that she looked confused. Almost dazed. Like she didn't know where she was or what she was doing. But I looked again and it was gone. Maybe I had imagined it. Wishful thinking. Hoping it was a nightmare. But this seething girl in front of me was real. Very real.  "Forget it, Fariz. We're through. And if you ever come near me again, I'll tell the police that you're stalking me. Accept it! Live with it! I never, ever want to see you again!"  And with that, my whole world came crashing down.
