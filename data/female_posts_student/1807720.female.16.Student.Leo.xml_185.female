I ate a fruit to hold me over til' morning.  Maybe I should re-think my eating habits.  They aren't really good and they are starting to cause deterioration of my body.  I mean sure I want to be thin, but health is more important.  Anyways I am going back to bed.  I am tired and feel a bit better now.
