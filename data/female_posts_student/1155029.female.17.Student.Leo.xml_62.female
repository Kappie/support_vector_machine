Tonight, because I no longer have a life, I ran a while in the rain with my father.  He brought home thai food with his nails painted purple and blue and green.  I helped him take it off with nailpolish remover.  Sometimes I wonder about him.  Aparently, he lost a bet.  So we ate the thai food together in the blue bowls my mother really hates when we use.  Sometimes she hides them behind the rice bowls.  Well, at least she wasn't home to yell.
