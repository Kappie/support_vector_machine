This wakes up my husband Steven you can't get back to sleep so climbs out of bed while I am asleep and goes and makes breakfast. I fell back to sleep and slept tell 6 when I realized my husband wasn't next to me. So I climbed out of bed and went and found him on the couch watching T.V.. Asked him what he was doing and he said he couldn't get back to sleep so I returned to bed sence I was still tired. was woke up at 8 by my daughter slitheringup the bed demanding my watch and some food. so I got up and got her her stuff.  I then gave Colby a bath and played with him for a bit then put him back to sleep.  I sleeped for about 30 more min then got up. I played sims and took care of my kids and bills for the rest of the morning.      This afternoon Steven, Brandi, Colby and I went with Stevens mentor to pizza hut. When we got home we went swimming with Kristi. Cheri had bought Brandi a new swimming flotation divice and it made so she could swimm with out being attatched to someone. then came home and took a shower and got colby ready for bed. Then got on here.
