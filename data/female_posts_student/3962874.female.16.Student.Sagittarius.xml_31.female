There is a nice trail down the block that we sometimes go walk on, but I just woke up so that is not going to happen. Although I do need to start working out. Zack said he could get me a gym membership for 20 bucks a month because he's working there now. That's what I need to do, get a job at the gym so that I can't avoid it. Anyway, today I'm going with Daniel to go shopping for some new clothes. His parents buy him clothes for school once a year. Mine usually do except both of them are a little short on money so I have to buy my own! I'm a spoiled brat and I'm not used to that.
