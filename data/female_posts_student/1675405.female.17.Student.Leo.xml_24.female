I would love to remain quiet, but I know that's a little out of reach, especially when it comes to something as demented as this. He is 17 and half, and she just turned 14. I'm sorry, but there is a problem there. He is really mature, well at least in all areas except this, and although I'm sure she may be in some aspects, she cannot be in all. I don't really care though, oh well. If he wants to do that, and ruin his reputation, then so be it. I'm not going to tell him what to do, and as far as I can contain myself, I'll keep from sharing my opinions as well.   Homecoming is coming, and yes, I guess I'll talk about it some more. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!!!! I have no one to go with really; I'm sure Heather isn't too enthused, and Marie, well, she has got a mind of her own lately. It was the whole "Miss Independant" theme after John broke up with her, but she's back to "I love him, I love him! I dont know what I'd do without him! He's my best friend!" Argh. So frustrating, not to mention sick.  But I love Marie to death, and I'm sure it is difficult to get over him, so as long as she asks me for advice, I'll give it to her, and as long as she is upset about everything I'll console her. It's all listed as the duties of a best friend. Or at least I'd like my friends to do that for me.  School is improving for me, especially stage band. Katie Baltzell told me I'm a lot chattier this year, and that's good. I'm trying to be! Last year I was really inclusive and it only was harmful. I really had my feelings hurt in that class, but this year I'm having a lot of fun. Nick and Neil Melaro are in there, along with Ricky and Justin, so I have some pretty good friends.  Tennis is really great, I'm doing well at my 3rd singles spot with a record of 4-3, and Heather and I are having a lot of fun thus far.  I'm just having fun this year, and I'm really working on my happiness. I haven't had too much luck with that lately, and I guess I've done a good job hiding it, because a lot of people would be surprised if they only knew what went on. But as of now, things are good, and I'm happy!
