I recognized a spelling error just as I started to publish and went to correct it... but it was too late... the little people inside my computer had already posted the incorrect and then the following corrected blog. Please accept my sincerest apologizes to those of you who had to read the blog twice. [please don't retract my blog privileges... i will use my time away to think about what i have done :)]
