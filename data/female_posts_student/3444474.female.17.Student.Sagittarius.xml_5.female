He went back to work a little bit afterward. I miss him. *sigh* Well, I think I'm seeing him tomorrow, I might not be, I don't know quite yet. I don't remember if we're doing something or not. I think we were going to see Farenheit 9/11...or was that Saturday...did we even decide on going or not!?  Bah. I'll figure it out. That's why his new cellphone is a beautiful thing :D  I was thinking about dropping by the Foote School at some point soon. I miss them. I wonder how many newbies are there this year.   I miss doing theatre in the summers...I miss doing theatre period. I feel like something is missing and I think that's it.   I want to be on stage...and now more than ever, I think that is what I'm meant to do. It's worth a stab in the dark. I'm not meant to sit at a desk my whole life, I couldn't do that...good Lord, my ADHD would totally not let me do that! I want the stage, I want the lights on my face and the makeup and the costumes, the memorizing and the blocking. I want the suspense and the drama and how at home I feel when I'm doing it.   I didn't think I'd miss it so much.   Damn.   I think I'm going to have to transfer somewhere where I can study theatre...shit...that sucks.   I had better do well first semester then, because I can't do this. I'm not meant to push paper my whole life, or work in an office. I love to learn but...I'd rather learn about theatre and acting than math and science.   *sigh* sooooo muuuuuuuch to think about. Blah.   We'll see where this goes. *shrugs*
