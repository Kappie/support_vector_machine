In theatre, we watched "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, then we got to go to the computer lab during Algebra 2, and history we colored of course, lol and in chem we made ice cream!!! Yeah, the passing period before chem, I met up with Kiera, and I was like I don't want to be here, so I was bitching about that, she was like yeah I know where you want to be...Oh man, making ice cream really hurts your hands, I was flipping that bag with ice and rock salt until my hands were freaking burning and red, they seriously didn't get warm until like 4. But it was good. Oh man, I have a german test tomorrow, and I need to go in for Algebra again, because I have to finish my test from last week and now the practice taks. Which really sucks because that is our graduation test and you have to get 35/60 to pass, and well I got 23/60, but I still have like 9-10 problems left, which still wouldn't help, because I'd have to get all those right and it still wouldn't even add up, oh well, hopefully I'll do better on the real one.  At this point, nothing anymore really matters...I just want to be 18...    Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? Do I ever cross your mind anytime? I miss you
