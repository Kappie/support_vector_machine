I'll never reach the point of concietedness, but I'm finally, finally happy with who I am. And fuck anyone with smart-ass comments on that. If a guy doesn't like me for who I am, I'm not gonna change for him.  It obviously wasn't meant to be. If there is such thing, I guess my soul-mate search would continue after this realization.  I want a guy who likes me for me. Not me pretending to be the girl he likes.  Life does go on after all.  I can be so blind sometimes.
