Eighty years later, by a bizarre coincidence, they lay in the same hospital, on their deathbeds, next to each other. One of them looked at the other and said, "So. What did you think?" -- Steven Wright  Today I dialed a wrong number... The other person said, "Hello?" and I said, "Hello, could I speak to Joey?"... They said, "Uh... I don't think so... he's only 2 months old." I said, "I'll wait." -- Steven Wright  "We have to leave now. You can sing to your jacket on the way." - Barney   "'I cannot overemphasize the importance of good grammar.' How ridiculous. I could easily overemphasize the importance of good grammar. For example, I could say: 'Bad grammar is the leading cause of slow, painful death in North America,' or 'Without good grammar, the United States would have lost World War II.'" - Dave Barry,  An Utterly Absurd Look at Grammar    "I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don't believe I deserved my friends." - Walt Whitman  "Most people don't know there are angels whose only job is to make sure you don't get too comfortable and fall asleep and miss your life." - Brian Andreas  "It is such a secret place, the land of tears." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery  "I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'." - Bob Newhart  "I had to make some optimistic assumptions to meet the revenue target. In week three, we're visited by an alien named D'utox Inag who offers to share his advanced technology." - Scott Adams,  Dilbert   "We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don't care for." - Marie Ebner von Eschenbach  "You can tell a lot about a person by how excited they are to do the Macarena." - Janeane Garofalo  "If email had been around before the telephone was invented, people would have said, 'Hey, forget email! With this new telephone invention I can actually talk to people!'" -  The Executive Speechwriter Newsletter   "What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness." - Leo Tolstoy   This was written by a student applying to college. He ended up attending NYU: "3A. ESSAY IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?  I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.  I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.  I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.  I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.  But I have not yet gone to college."   "What eludes logic is the most precious element in us." -C. Andre Gide   "They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night."  -Poe   "Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it." - Soren Kierkegaard  "Strength is born in the deep silence of long-suffering hearts; not amid joy." - Felicia D. Hemas  "You're part of the Sup Generation. You say 'Sup?' which is short for 'Wassup?' which is short for 'What's up?' which is short for 'What is up?' Pretty soon it's just going to be 'Sss.'" - Prof. Rutenburg  "When suffering knocks at your door and you say there is no seat for him, he tells you not to worry because he has brought his own stool." - Chinua Achebe,  Arrow of God   "Build a man a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life." - Terry Pratchett  "To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is the meaning of success." - Ralph Waldo Emerson  "McDonald's 'breakfast for under a dollar' actually costs much more that that. You have to factor in the cost of coronary bypass surgery." - George Carlin  "If people on Jeopardy are so smart, then why can't they write names better?" - Todd Glass   "It does not do to leave a Dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him." - J.R.R. Tolkien   "Oh, what a tangled web do parents weave, when they think that their children are naive." - Ogden Nash  "Joel Cairo: You always have a very smooth explanation. Sam Spade: What do you want me to do, learn to stutter?" -  The Maltese Falcon   "There are some that only employ words for the purpose of disguising their thoughts." - Voltaire
