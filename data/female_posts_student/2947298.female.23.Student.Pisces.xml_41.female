It is a short period of time but we really have known each other for 9months.  He took a while asking me out.  We have had our ups and downs, mostly I had downs and he helped me back up. He is the only boyfriend I ever had that my whole family has liked! In fact the only one my family  has really liked at all.  And I am also welcomed by his family.  And he is the only person who puts up with my insane ideas, in fact he helps me along!  He truly understands me like no one else does, and I get him.  He makes me laugh even when I am very upset or mad.  He goes to the end of the earth and back for me and treats me like the wonderful woman I am.  And I try my darnedest to treat him as great as he treats me.  He's cute and TALL and has beautiful eyes like dusk. He listens to me go on and on describing things and how I see them (the artist in me likes doing that).  I call him my imaginary friends cuz sometimes I swear he is so perfect and complimentary to me that he must be in my brain. I've asked Crystal many times if he is really next to me (kiddingly).  But he is real and is mine.  I can't believe I found someone so perfect.  And I always forget that he's three and a half years younger than me!  He acts older and more together than ANY boyfriend I've ever had.  And he will be the man I marry! (I really really think and hope) So it's a short period of time but it will grow to surpass all time and space!!! We are just that great together. Not to say he hasn't had his downs and his time in the hospital, but I like to think of him as invincible... oh and as a senator!
