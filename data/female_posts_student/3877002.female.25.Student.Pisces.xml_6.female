If I hear one more person at work tell me how they once began writing a romance novel or that I should start sending love stories into Redbook, I will seriously scream.    Tell me to smile.   Unless they are complimenting my shoes, I really wish random men on the street would never utter any of the following phrases - "You'd be real pretty if you cracked a smile" or "Hey honey, it ain't that bad."  Well, for once I'd like to tell them that yes honey, sometimes it is that bad.
