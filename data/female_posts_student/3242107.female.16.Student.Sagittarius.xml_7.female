"  and then he went in the game as the qb. haha. but yea. if youre reading this clint... haha i still have that pick of you in the football team pic. lol i remember that day too. you forgot your socks or pants or something lol. good times good times. and dont forget! when you come back the first thing we're doing is playing that stupid game we made up, and then we're going  to megans, and then we're all going to the mall and stuff, and then we're going to the skate park thats kinda by her house! lol i really need more pics of you for my scrapbook.
