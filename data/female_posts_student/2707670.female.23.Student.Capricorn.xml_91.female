I feel like my head is going to explode after studying for an entire day. I hate finals especially when they are comprehensive and all equasions and you don't get a note card or anything. This totally blows and I can't wait until 9pm tonight when I will be done with finals for a couple of months. Hope everyone else has a great week and I have funny stuff to share but I have to go take my test now. Later!
