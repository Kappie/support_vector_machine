It snowed the night before, but that was nothing new; it always snows the night before I leave Moscow.  And sure enough, the snow was melting and the sun was out when I blew out of town just after 1.    Made it to Coeur d'Alene just after 230 to find gray, doomsday clouds and a sheet of ice masquerading as a highway waiting for me.   "Should be fine."  The slush and snow from the night's storm had frozen to the road nicely.    "So I won't get there till 11...it'll be okay.  I'm going to make it, by god!"  An hour and a half and 40 miles later, I admitted defeat, at least for the night.  Got a nice, cozy, $70 room at the Wallace Best Western and tried to relax.  Fought the urge to call Lorraine (we'll get to her later), and found comfort with the Golden Girls instead.    Not so bright and early the next morning I stoically folded back into my trusty steed and made my way over the mountain.  The roads didn't actually clear up until Missoula, and I was still trying to convince myself that I could make it to Bozeman at a respectable hour.  "Okay, it's only 11.  If all goes well, I could be there by 2.  That's practically a whole day; plus we'll have Sunday, too."  And for the most part, it did go well.  The wet roads were fine, until I remembered that it was 20 degrees outside and if they were wet, they could just as easily be icy.  But damnit, I'd made a plan and fuck if the goddamned weather was going to cheat me out of it!!  Kept thinking about arriving and falling into Levi's couch, drinking tea or something stronger, and maybe taking our relationship to the next level.    But home was sounding pretty good, too.  Could sleep in my cave, have time to lay around before hitting the outlines and practice exams next week.  But no!  That's not what was supposed to happen!  I'm supposed to be in Bozeman!  That's where I'm going!  Don't try to stop me!    "You could have two entire days to yourself to get prepared."  "SHUT UP!  I want to see my boyfriend!"  "And get back in the car Monday morning..."  "I can study Monday afternoon!"  "After driving half the day?"  "If I have to!!  See..here's the turn off, I'm going to Butte!  I'll show you what I want!"  So I went.  And halfway through the town, I realized I'd be bad news.  Just thinking about how much time we lost, what all we could've done but would be impossible now.  IMPOSSIBLE!  And if I did get home Monday, I knew I wouldn't do any work and I'd just be pissesd at myself all week for not doing what I knew I should...even though I didn't want to.     The fucking practical side won out again...damnit!    And today, I'm sooo glad it did.
