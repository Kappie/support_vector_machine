I suppose that I've just got better things to do.  So anyways, today, I was looking at this really cool site online, and I have decided everything that I want to get pierced: Cartilage (home) Lobe (x2) (home) Another ear part (professional) Tongue    (home) Right Nose (home) Belly Button (home)  So what's that, like 7 piercings?  And call me crazy or whatever, but I also sorrta wanna get my nipples and my clit pierced, but I think that those would hurt like hell, and I'm not sure that I could take that.  Anyways, those would totally have to be professionally done, so I have awhile to contemplate...  As for tattoos, their are three that I want. 1. A solid black paw print on my left ankle. 2. Something all the way around my upper arm, but not sure what yet. 3. A Chinese tattoo that's meaningful to me either on my back sholderblade (right) or in the upper or lower center of my back.    So still undecided on those, but it's ok.  Like I said, I have awhile to decide.  Any thoughts or comments to help me choose?  Well, gonna go console with a friend now!  Be back tomarrow!  Luv,  Ani
