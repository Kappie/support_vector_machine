I'd like to do the big things and   the splendid things for you,   To brush the gray from out your skies   and leave them only blue;   I'd like to say the kindly things that   I so oft have heard,   And feel that I could rouse your soul   the way that mine you've stirred.   I'd like to give you back the joy   that you have given me,   Yet that were wishing you a need   I hope will never be;   I'd like to make you feel as rich as I,   who travel on   Undaunted in the darkest hours with you to   lean upon.   I'm wishing at this time that I   could but repay   A portion of the gladness that   you've strewn along my way;   And could I have one wish this year,   this only would it be:   I'd like to be the sort of friend   that you have been to me.   - Heather Haff -
