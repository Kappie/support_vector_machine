Then I went to the bowling alley and ate dinner. We had this bitchy waitress and I wanted to punch her in the face. She didn't even deserve the dollar tip my mom gave her. Then Carol and I went to the mall. I bought a purse finally. It's really cool. Then Carol and I saw The Notebook. It was so good. I cried. You could hear everyone in the theater crying. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good love story and I guarantee that you will cry.  Then today was graduation. Ohh sadness. I can't say I was overly sad though. And I can't say I'm going to miss anyone that much. I know I will miss Sarah in Wind Ensemble but other than that I don't think I will mind the seniors being gone sorry to say. Well since they just graduated that would make me a senior wouldn't it? I can't believe I'm a senior now! Well I got there, played, watched the rest of the ceremony, talked to Jon and Sarah and Kim and people when it was over. Then I went to Ward's and got ice cream and now I'm home doing nothing!  Later I think I'm going to Brian's graduation party for a little while. Other than that I'm doing absolutely nothing so if anyone wants to do anything that would be the greatest.  Tomorrow I'm either doing nothing or I'm going to my grandma's house to paint her porch and make some money.  Listening to: [Science Fiction by Rufio]  These are the whispers that you hear inside your mind Subtle yet forceful they are tearing at your side. She can't see, and I can't believe she's falling.  But I will be there helping when you call on me.  Prove it to the world you're perfect, your choking on your pride. Gonna kill yourself believing in these beautiful lies.  Don't believe this science fiction, tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes.    There's more to life than all the beauty that they sell.  Why must we always try to look like someone else? She can't see, and I can't believe she's falling. But I will be there helping when you call on me. Prove it to the world you're perfect, your choking on your pride. Gonna kill yourself believing in these beautiful lies.  Don't believe this science fiction, tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes. Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever, are all she's ever known...  Don't believe this science fiction. Tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes
