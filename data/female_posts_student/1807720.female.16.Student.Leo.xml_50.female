It was alright I suppose I mean my overall average for math right now is a 70% and if I get anything below that even I WILL die so yeah I'm makin a promise to myself NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I *will NOT* get anything below 70 in math from here on in but I have been giving it my all it's just I can't always get the help I need which is really frustrating.  But well I feel the Chem teacher is really trying to help me and I feel like she finally understands that it is not easy for me.  The chem chapter 5 test is tommorrow and I studied for like ever tonight and did a little review on stuff the days before.  I really feel ready for this and all I can say is "bring that chem test on" cause yes I believe in my heart that if I truly believe that I can do good than I can do anything.  That's right...ANYTHING.  and well understanding the concentration of ions was really challenging but I think tonight when I just took a little bit more time to go through things I think I am getting it alot more and everything in this unit has been challenging but I have really been working hard that like right now in this current unit I have improved my marks drastically compared to the first unit.  Things are kind of coming together but well with that 70 in math it worries me a little cause well the whole "I want to make honours thing going through my head."  Honestly I feel I really in my heart deserve it more than anything if only people knew how many hours I spend trying to work through my homework, studying, and even trying to figure out math.  No matter what I know in my heart that I have done my very best and worked my ass off to get where I am.  I'm listening to a great song right now.  It's true and so touching by hilary duff.  It goes like this...     Inner Strength  Gotta find your inner strength If you can't then just throw life away gotta learn to rely on you Beauty, strength, and wisdon too  Your beautiful inside and out Lead a great life without a doubt Don't need a man to make things fair It's more than likely he won't be there  Listen girl gotta know it's true In the end all you've got is you  ~A song by Hilary Duff
