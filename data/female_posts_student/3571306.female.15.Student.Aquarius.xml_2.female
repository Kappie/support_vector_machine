You'd think we could work stuff out but noooo, we're dysfunctional. Heh, but I'm fine now. I let it all out by yelling my brains out about a certain *ahem* annoying biatch. (Ya'll know who I'm talkin' 'bout) Arrrgh she just wouldn't leave me alone! You'd think she would get the hint by now, geez...It's like everytime you turn around she's there! Lol LEECH!!! But hey, wutcha gunna do with that damn Puddle? She'll do lotsa stuff to you and expect to be liked after she's driven the knife into your back like 20 times. Grrreat...I hate this damn clingy thing. I already have a shadow thank you very much! *Sigh*...I'll never have a normal life. Too many things in the way of one. Well for me anyway. Everyone seems just so happy-go-lucky and here I am sulking. You may be reading this and saying "WTF!?", but this is what's going on in the inside. No one ever sees it, except me. Being happy is so my thing right? Sure, only in school though. When I'm around people I like, all my problems just slip away quietly. Never seen nor thought of when I'm with friends. You guys make me feel waaay better. It's my escape, my sanctuary. You may not realize it, but you guys do a lot for me. For this, I thank you. It's when I'm at home, by myself, that this stuff comes back to haunt me. Sorry Grace, I'm being too serious aren't I? Well, my life  is  serious so there's no helping it. That's all I got to say for now so, peace up, A-town. (Lol, I'm so cool, don't you dare say otherwise!)
