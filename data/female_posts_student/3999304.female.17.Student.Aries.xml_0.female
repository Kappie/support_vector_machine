KC (my beloved sis) brought along a cd with a copy of my fav mp3's, her new fan art and FFX-2 story movie. too bad i did't brought it along now, then i'd be watching the movie and not web surfin'...  i got the fever and annoying flue today too. i feel good about it for i haven't got any fever for the year (=^.^=) i love falling sick, except for my asthma attack. it's nightmare for me.  this is the first pic i'd try to post in a blog now.. one of my sis great works with her pencil..
