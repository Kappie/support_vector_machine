For those of you who have stayed reading this I applaud you.  You will be wishing you didn't.   I can't believe how many stupid people there are in this world. Some mothers just chose not to quit with the drugs when they discovered that they were pregnant, I guess. Or perhaps they felt that bringing another f**k-up into this world might make it a little better....NEWS FLASH: Two wrongs do not make a right!   There are so many people out there that are constantly depending on the people around them to get them out of the s**t that they fell into in the first place, and I for one was one of the helpless victims that got pulled into it because I figured it might get me in good with whatever is waiting for me on the other side...oops...big mistake. If you see someone drowning in their own s**t, don't try to help them. Walk on, as Bono would say, and leave them to find the branch that will pull them out, or let them drown. Either way, you'll be safe from it.  Laters...Amanda
