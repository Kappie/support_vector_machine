Day 2: Can I tell you how much alcohol slows down the little hamster in my head, man, he gets slower and slower each time, and now I think hes figured out how to just sit by the wheel and spin it in his little hamster hand, so he doesn't have to get up and run...HUNGOVER...Ridiculous, I was all about some propel and Tylenol...[continues on about her craziness at the beach, concluding with]...So today we had the car ride from hell which you already know about and thats pretty much it, there was a whole bunch of stuff I wanted to tell you but I think the hamster ran away  Thanks April I needed a laugh
