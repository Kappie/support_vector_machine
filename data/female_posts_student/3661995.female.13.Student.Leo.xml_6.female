He's the computer genius in the family... coz that's what he studied in the university. He's at work now while my second brother is in the army.       I wish I could fix it myself... but I'm completely clueless on how, so I guess I'll be using his computer then. Hopefully, I won't damage his too. I seem to be disatrous with technology. I swear, everything related to electricity breaks down when I am near it...      I'm currently surfing the net, hoping to find some place of interest. I"M BORED! Maybe I should do my homework... or maybe, she'll do it for me.        Well, off to surf again! Bye!!
