Miranda left for horse camp first thing this morning. I picked her up at 3:15 and took her and her friend Abby over to dance. Kyle had his friend over. He was pretty darned annoying… but not really a bad kid. He didn’t want to help pick up Life after we played and kept like throwing little rubber balls at me and such. He didn’t really do much that could hurt me badly or anything… it was just way obnoxious. Kyle kept standing up for me, though. And that was way cute.   I went to Lincoln yesterday with Leese. Then she came over to “mah crib” and we had a spaghetti picnic and went down to the broken bridge! We took some cute pictures… but I look like a boy cuz I had a big tee on and my hair back in a braid. So we have plans to get somewhat cuter and go back down there tomorrow and get more fun pictures.     urlLink     urlLink       urlLink     urlLink      Jay just called a few minutes ago to see if I’m up for a Kreckle’s run. Yum yum! Of course I’m up for Kreckle’s! How could I not be? And I WAY ready to see jay. It’s been over two weeks since I saw him last. Darn that  urlLink Spoke Folk  stealing him and Gretchen way.   Well, I’ll be wrapping it up so I can continue writing my entry over the week with Doug!   =) Lyd
