Now, I'm standing, alone. They don't understand it, and they never will. I don't know why, thinking all these doesn't matter at school, the emotions will all explode the moment I reach home.I dunno why. But recently, so many things happened. So unfair. Tears had dropped countless of times, yet the matters don't help at all.. they don't. A lot of unsolvable problems. A lot of troubles. How can crying help? I dunno.............I dunno. Matters don't help, they're giving more and more serious problems then ever. Just by changing a new bag, just by sharing the same colour, people talk. I know she don't like this but this is the bag I want. I would prefer it in brown but there ain't a choice. I need the bag..........but no. People giving me all sorts of attitudes and criticises. Life's not fair at all.......................... Early in the morning, I'm fully awake today, having slept through most of the time.english lesson is quite ok..............I scored pretty ok for the common test, quite satisfied. But PE came, my imagination run wild again....I automatically volunteered to run with yuhui but she directly, out of so many people, refused, once again and again. I dunno why but I really kan ta bu shuang nowadays....... she think she who sia.............. she had so many people, loved, in co, studies oso good............I regret. I really regretted letting her to read my blog. That had not lead to good terms, that had led me to think that she will only create more and more trouble for me. Because of one yuhui, I had to do it! It ain't fair! IT IS NOT FAIR!!! The teacher skipped the geography lesson. new eh? go to recess, eat, come up. On the way I encounter yina, I told her to come for band but she skipped in the end. Why. Why is everything only happening to the thirds? Why am the one doing all these stuff!? They're fortunate to be in band...they're so many things to learn, to be together as one united band, always. But.............but............but, why are people quitting band instead...I had no choice, I had to let her go once again. I know all her friends are getting the bad impressions of me because I went to find her every single time. But no matter how much I ask, she won't come back..............she's lost. There's maths and then science. Then is band........There's not much to talk about. The silence between me and those two. I didn't want to talk at all...I know I'm the outcast. I know. I know..........but then again.....please. please do not let me feel badder by whispering between yourselves, giggling silently without telling me a single thing of what you're talking about....it's not fair at all.....is it? Why. Why am I the one suffering? Why am I the one borned with the fate of getting no trustworthy friends at all....Who. who can tell me why.................. Tell me why. Firstly, when I reached the band room. I stopped being with them. I had enough, they won't notice my prescence anyway, my existance don't make a different to this world. Why am I even borned? I don't know...I don't know...so set up instrument, go wash reed, kaingee come back to band... we didn't speak for ages but exchange just side comments. Mr ong said he don't talk except to give the place for playing and directions. It was like doing a mime....lol! Had a great time laughing.........it was great. Nizam was lame....haha. Now I see what jaslyn meant by him being a lame guy.............haha. it was a great practice, though I longed that it can be longer. But something I absolutely hate is that mr ong actually suggested us to have band remedials! FOR 2HRS  EVERYDAY !!!! OMG. from today onwards, I must work hard!! VERY HARD!haiz... Didn't fall in. This is the best time! Then borrow instrument. I saw the two of them ran away before I could even call them and reluctantly follow daphne instead. Though I didn't spend a lot of time with her, she's quite a nice girl to be with. Then her car come, we said goodbye and I saw the pair come out of sch.  i didn't know why but I immediately turn and walked away. I don't want to disturb them anymore. Their mere prescence had caused something more.......it made me feel so out of place, so odd one out, so outcast, so alone................ All of the fears came pouring out of me the minute I reached home, laughter can only last for short term and only at school........ I feel that I'm going crazy....very soon.
