Can you be partially happy? It's almost as if...my happiness is forced upon me. I dont know if I'm making any sense..but somebody, somewhere knows what I mean.   It's like..I'm depressed..deep down inside. I hate myself, but I cover it with selfishnes..Yes, I am selfish..and it is becoming a problem between Bill and I. Unfortunatly, I dont know how to stop. Maybe it's because I try to love myself because I feel that nobody else does. *sigh*..I just want to get better. I want to be able to say that I am happy to the fullest, although..I feel that can never happen. He may not want to be with *you*...but, oh nevermind. I still think of how beautiful you are, and how good you made me feel about myself. I need to stop before I upset myself again.   Coffee is excellent. I love Coffee...Besides the fact that it wakes me up. heh, I told my dad yesterday to come in and give me coffee when he makes it, and..I woke up (feeling his presence) and he was standing over me holding out coffee with a grin on his face. That's some scary shit, but it's cool. My dads coffee is the shit. So then I decided to get on and write..I haven't wrote in a while and you said that *you* still read, which makes me happy. I'm glad that you do..because right now...and pretty much always you're the only one who knows how I really feel about things. Although, I do have to kind of not say everything incase this blog gets put in front of the wrong eyes. I want *you* to be a part of my Blog..I want you to write posts, in here. It will still be my blog, but..I want you to have some too. Will you? If you will..IM me later and I'll give you the password and stuff.   Anyway..I am going to go now, even though I have nothing else to do for a few hours. *sigh*...Bye bye
