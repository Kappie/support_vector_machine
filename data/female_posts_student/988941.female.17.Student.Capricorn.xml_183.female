The 7 crew members were going in NASA's oldest shuttle and knew their lives were at risk. People die all over the world every day, so what so different about 7 extra people? That is my opinion, I will say nothing more.  I dont read newspapers, whats the point in paying when you have  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/news ?
