I should start by saying that my life is one big giant mess and no matter how many times I try to make it better or fix it just so I end up screwing it up even more.  I try so hard to appear to everyone like nothing matters, nothing gets to me but it does.  Everything does.  I think the best word to describe me is broken or breakable.  I'm just going to lay this out there.  No one gives a shit.  I mean really.  People say they do, they say they care and I am sure in the moment they say it they mean it but when you are always aware you are never the first person on anyone's mind... well the first part doesn't end up meaning too much.  I'm so tired of being tired and sad.  I am so tired of crying and I am even more tired of being hurt every second of everyday.  Why do I care?  What's the point?  People say I am negative, it's not real, it's just a shield, a way of protecting myself.  I'm possibly one of the most optimistic people you'd ever meet but you don't know that because I won't let you know that.  I'm sad.  I'm pathetic.  Most of all I'm just so fragile.  I don't feel like I really belong anywhere nowadays and it's a hard feeling to shake.  People always say you make your own happiness and your own pain... well I am trying to avoid the latter and do the first but I find it impossible.  I can't.  So the question is, what's wrong with me?  Why am I so f-in easy to toss away?  And I am, cause I do it to myself.  I don't matter, I can't matter, I don't let myself matter.  And as for myself?  Look at me.  I was with two of my cousins this weekend and the whole time I just kept thinking why didn't I come out morally sound and with a good outlook on life?  I try so very hard to be what other people want and I somewhere in all of that I lost myself.  I keep telling myself I'll figure it all out and one day everything will just click.  I tell myself to shake off things that shouldn't bother me but do and I can't.  More importantly I tell myself to just be happy and the truth is I'm not so sure I know what that is.  Some of my friends hurt me and I don't know why, some of them are wonderful and I wish I could focus on them only.  Some of them expect too much from me.  I used to think I belonged here and not up in Boston... but I think now I am wrong.  I don't belong anywhere and that fact just breaks my heart.  Everything is breaking my heart.
