Always "I am running", never "I run". Dalat is therefore 'being'  -m: Indicates the opposite of -r, in other words, the self. Dalam is therefore 'self-existence' or 'me' -si: Indicates object further distanced from the observed. Dalarsi therefore falls into the third person -ke: Is appended to word to indicate "with word", as in existing in close proximity,or joining in an activity together, not utilizing something as a tool.  -ko: Locative; "at word" -ki: "Be able to" -ci: Superlative (The Most, -est) -'am: "To me", "In my opinion" -'ar: "To you" -'arsi: "To him/her/it/they"   Particles:  Ka: Particle which turns sentence into a question Ku: "And"- links clauses of sentence, not individual words  Thus it translates to:    Won't you be being with me?
