I had to work on Friday and Sunday, but they let me out a couple hours early on Sunday, so I was very happy about that. I got a lot of candy, too. Saturday was Matthew and my 6 month anniversary. So, he got to hang out with me all day Saturday. We were over at Grandma's for awhile and then we went church (an hour and a half long!!!) And, he also hung out with me on Sunday after Dave, Donna, Chelsea, and Gabe left our house. It was so good to see them. Chelsea is going to quit college and go to Chicago to become a starving actress-trying to get into commercials, movies, plays, whatever...So, good luck for her. I think she'll make it-but I am her cousin, so I don't know.  Saturday is swing show, and I am getting even more nervous every time I think about it. I have been practicing my song all afternoon, and my fingers are starting to hurt alittle, but once I get done with this I am going to start practicing again. :)
