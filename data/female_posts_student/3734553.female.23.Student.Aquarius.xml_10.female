I like the different twist on the story.    Started packing today for Houston. Can't wait.    News from Evan's mom... they sent the PCVs back to their posts. things have started to calm down. A miner in Southern Guinea found a 128 caret diamondand the govt. thinks this will solve all their money issues. Strange the way things work out.
