It's so simple that I wonder why nobody hasn't come up with it  sooner. I'm talking about my kitchen savior -  the  urlLink Dawn Power Dish Brush .  I cook my own meal pretty often and am trying  to cook "healthy" as mush as possible. Of course, that usually translates to grilling and not deep  frying or any method with lots of oil involved. And that, my friend, tends to leave you with a very  nasty rough  stubborn stain behind to clean up  and ruin your hands and nails in the process... as if dish washing hasn't done its fair share already.  You would think that when you decide (against  your better judgment) to spend the money on decent cookwares instead of your months-long, lusting after,  wishlisty gadget, the least your investment could do  for you is to *not* add more work to the work amount  it's supposed to reduce. The last time I made my favorite recipe, grilled lemongrass chicken, it took me three days before I could get rid of all the burnt bits and pieces off the so-called nonstick pan. I scrubbed with the sponge. I left hot water in the pan overnight.  I boiled vinegarsolution in it -- pretty much anything I  could think of. Three friggin days of periodically checking in to the kitchen to see whether the stain has "softened up".  Suffice to say, I haven't grilled any lemongrass chicken since.  Then I stumbled upon my knight in a shiny, white (albeit plastic) armor in the cleaning solution aisle one day. It was the last one left on a rather new display that made it kinda stand out. At close inspection, the Dawn Power dish brush is a foot-long stick similar to that of a stick blender, with a rubber button and a replaceable brush head, and runs on batteries (4 AAs) -- sort of like an electric toothbrush for the kitchen. I love my Braun electric toothbrush, so the Dawn brush really appealed to me. My only concern at the time was that the battery-powered brush might not possess enough vigor to fight the seemingly immovable stain foe. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try anyway since the price was reasonable enough ($8.xx). As an insurance, I also bought  urlLink Dawn Power Dissolver . Just in case. Next stop... poultry section! Can't try the brush without the stain now, can I?  As it turned out, I didn't even need the DPD -- though I have  to say it was a nice added bonus. The brush worked wonderfully with just warm water and the dish washing detergent. Extra pressure was needed here and there, but overall it got the job done in under a minute. Now I'm impressed! These days I use the DPB exclusively for the pots, pans, and the acrylic cutting  board. I found that it also works well in scrubbing off the label glue that was left behind on the surface without leaving any scratching mark, too. So far after a week of daily use,  the brush is still going strong. I have yet to see how long the batteries last, but I estimate that it should last for  a while.  A happily married friend once told me, if she were to have an affair, it would be with her Dyson. I think I now can say the same for me with Dawn Power Dish Brush. Now... if only they  would come up with one for the bathroom!
