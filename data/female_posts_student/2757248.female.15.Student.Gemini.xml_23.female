YAY ..came back upstairs, got my schoolbag, id, and purse... then we left ..got to school and went in the office cause they announced yesterday there was a lost cell phone turned in and i didnt realize until this morning that missing cell phone was MINE. so i went to get it. then i saw kristen and told her bout my phone. she thot i said i lost my baby instead of phone.. phone, baby.. i dont hear how she coulda gotten that but OK.  ..me and kristen went to my locker and i got my books we talked then she left.. BELL RANG   A.M HOMEROOM: talked to ppl and ignored mr.a when he told me to shut up. 1-3: HEALTH- we talked about relationships and EVERYONE fell asleep.. but i didnt i like that class 4-6: SCIENCE- Tested all hour 7-9: RELIGION- Highlighted 10-12: ALGEBRA- quiz and went over homework 13-14: LUNCH- i got my salad, sat down, and left. i dont enjoy lunch anymore.  OK ...GOT OUTSIDE and my schoolbag was missing. and i knew who did it.. so i was like OK LETS BE A LIL IMMATURE AND TAKE MY SCHOOLBAG AND HIDE IT FROM ME. i mean.. are we still in 4th grade? didnt think so.   GROW UP.    and ACT YOUR AGE. its RIDICULOUS. 15-17: OFF. i went to the lib. to look stuff up then went back out in the breeze way.. GUESS WHAT WAS THERE.. *GASPS DRAMATICALLY AND PUTS HANDS TO CHEEKS* WHO COULD HAVE PUT MY SCHOOLBAG BACK? hmmmm..... so i inspected it ...nothing missing. these ppl are weird, if they're gonna steal a schoolbag but nothing out of it. but im sure they wouldve if there was something of value in there. but theres not. just letters to sonny. 18-20: SPANISH- dont remember PM HOMEROOM: talked to gwen and steph and melodie about the "DANCE". EEK! then me and steph started talken bout drivers ed.   socially, i KNOW im better i just need to take advantage of the oppourtunities that i've been given. bc i know that if i keep running down the road im on i'll get to a dead end then have to turn around and go back to where i started.. so im just gonna take a SMALL DETOUR on my "road" although im looking forward to my "detour" im excited about the "whole new road" i'll be running on in 3 weeks and 1 day.   that was my day.. it was pretty bad cause of the whole schoolbag thing but i just have to get over my astonishment of other ppls immaturity. then i'll be good.   love you sonny
