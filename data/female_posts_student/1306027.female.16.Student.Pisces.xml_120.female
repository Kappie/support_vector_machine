I'm very upset about this, yes, but it could not be helped. If you would like to visit my xanga, it's  urlLink here .   In other Meghan news,  My mom has been working late again and she's really starting to get crabby. Today she was really touchy and stuff about everything and it's only making everybody cranky. I think my dad caught the crank too, so now everybody's yelling and I just want to crawl up in my room and never come out. That would be so much fun. I need to get rid of this headache first though...  Other than my parent's being cranky, everything is good. I don't have to work again until Saturday and tomorrow I have to go with my parents to check out a site for the fund-raiser. Bah. I'm so busy.  Ok so that's about it for now. Not exactly inspired but hey- it was worth the 5 minutes of typing and backspacing.
