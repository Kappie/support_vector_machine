I love to hang out with my friends when I can or I'm not being lazy, there is the whole teen-angst thing I got going on and of course I am always "mad at the world" as my dad would put it. I am pretty laid back, and if you wanna talk baseball or politics I'm your gal. Keeping up on what's going on in the world is very important to me because I will soon be a voter. I love to shop and I am very girlie but I also love to talk sports. People always say why do you talk about that, why are you so into sports, why this and why that? I am who I am so get over it. If you don't wanna talk sports with me that's to bad, I'll find someone who will. I am very strong-willed and I couldn't care less about what people think of me, but don't think I wont say anything if you talk mess about me. I would close with something witty, but I'm to sleepy to think, so until tomorrow I bid you farewell.
