It's so nice to know that there really are intelligent women out there writing worthwhile non-fiction and speaking on news shows without resorting to personal attacks.   Kerry earned himself yet another foot-in-mouth award for his little comment about the President's mountain biking accident yesterday. Just goes to show that he really is an ignorant, insensitive, incindeary prick. Just remember, boys and girls, "Kerry is scary, Kerry is scary."  :)  Political commentary aside, I'm happy to say that tomorrow morning I will be taking my last antibiotic, and I've been sitting at the computer for nearly 2 hours now without any pain. And I drove myself to Walmart to buy ice cream bars and cat food. It's been an exciting day.
