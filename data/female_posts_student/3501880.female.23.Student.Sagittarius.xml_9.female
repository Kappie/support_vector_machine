I just wanted to say how much I LOVE my dad, and was thinking that I have the relationship with him now that I didn't think I could ever had. For many years, I found him downright asshole-ish, but I guess both of us have mellowed out over the years, and he makes me laugh and gives me a good kick in the ass when I need it. Thanks, Dad, and I love you!  ****  On a completely different note, and this is really something I should not be talking about in the same entry as my dad, but does anyone have tips for, um, shaving "down there"? I have been trying something new, I guess and I am not sure how exactly I can avoid the razor burn and irritation that it brings. I don't have money to wax either, so if anyone has any suggestions, please leave me a post. Gracias!
