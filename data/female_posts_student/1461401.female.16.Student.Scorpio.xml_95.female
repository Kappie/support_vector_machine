I love making up new words. I'm ready way too early, but at least I'm ready... oh wait... I'm not packed yet. For anything. Hmmm, I might want to go do that. Oh well, all in good time. I'm so excited. Oh wait... I have to wrap something too. I would tell you, but if this one person found out, I would be shot on sight. Oh well. All in good time, as I said. Man, I'm really repeating myself today. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I only got 5 hours of sleep last night. I might have to pick up a coffee at grounds when I go get balloons. Whoa... who said anything about balloons? I know I didn't...  It's all an illusion, go back to sleep.
