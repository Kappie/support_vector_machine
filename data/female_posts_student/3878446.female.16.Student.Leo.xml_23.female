But it has to be the most fun I have ever had. We walked down to "the beach" and found that it was not a beach afterall, but a mud pit....haha, it all went down hill from there. I wasn't going to participate...that didn't last long, I was COVERED from head to toe, i want to tear up my backyard, and have a mud fight for my birthday (which is in two weeks!) .  By the way, I've decided that I'm going to talk about my camp experiences, throughout different posts, otherwise you would have one long ass post to read. So, thats all for now.
