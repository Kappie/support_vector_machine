I have to get my ass to school and go through it till god knows what time.'       Ah well, thank god I had set two alarm. Seemingly, my watch fell asleep somehow and didn't ring. The caribiner watch didn't, thankfully. Guess I should go buy a clock for myself some day... Exactly when, I don't know, so don't ask me.      After dragging myself out of bed and freshened up, I trudged to the kitchen, only to find that there's no milk. 'Hey... This ain't funny you know...' Ah, well... That's bread and plain water for my breakfast.      Hence, I went to school, water still dripping wetly from all directions. Potted plants were blown in a disarray, though it didn't bother me at all. They weren't mine to start with.      Nothing interesting seems to go on in school though, ironically, even though I am surrounded with more people. Bleah... Guess keeping to myself is still the best... One amusing thing though... The Physics teacher suddenly went 'mad' issuing commands for various weird items. I didn't mind though, not that I had everything. The only thing was, that I was sitting near the back, playing fake still works as seen from her angle.      Thus, that's how I got past the school hours. The  official  school hours. Off to lunch, though that took ten minutes before we decided on where to eat at. Went there, eat, and off we go, amusing ourselves with interesting topics on 'airports', as well as a minor squeak from a certain person when a car came.       Funny. Really funny.      Got back to school and began to do the various stretching for the fitness test. Lame components seriously, wish someone would go say it's wasting time, but of course, no one does. At least, till now. Off to five stupid stations we go, interesting events happening along the way between us, and the teachers. Amusing, as usual.      Shuttle run. Interestingly interesting. Went to the only male teacher, because he was the best in giving the timing. Just like what one of the teachers in charge of othe tests had previously said, encouragements are needed. Hence, the encouragements are as followed:      "Shao Wei is coming!! Quick!! You can't catch him with this speed you know!"   "There's a dog behind you! Run!! It's catching up!"   "Your brother is chasing you from behind! He's gaining up! Ahhh!!!"    "If you can run within ten seconds, I will sponsor you money to open a store."   "There's a car behind you! Run faster!"       Though whether or not these made us run faster, I had no idea, though the last one was a complete failure. Yet, at least these provided the teachers with some entertainment, it still worked...as a form of amusement.      I rest my case, for now.
