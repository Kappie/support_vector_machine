So, naturally, I wrote about it. Enjoy!     [- After the Rain .-]  But it's beautiful; water trickles down a crumbled leaf, and I wonder if people are akin to anything adjacent to themselves.  The droplet of star-shine glimmers, a flicker of galaxy trekking the crinkled membrane. So, we break, beings frail enough to fracture into so many slivers of human understanding, and it barely exists.   But it's beautiful, a fragile film developing across the open porch; the web trembles gently, humming while beads brook the thread.  I feel fragile sometimes; my fingers trail the railing, and paint flakes beneath my nails.  The shavings curl and float off, iodine orange stained flesh, and a starched tree leans over the roof. It's already paper, white and thin as it coughs against the scales on the roof; the roof itself heaves a heavy sigh, stretching and illustrating the tapering skin of cement.   Is it true, that people don't understand me, or is it just that I'm not telling them?  My mouth moves silently, air tasting the crevice between my lips, but not catching my words. Tears are burning beneath my eyelids, and they keep fluttering as if they could drive them back with a scarcewisp of wind.  Wood creaks beneath my bare feet, moist with many open mouths; they gasp and grasp for the rain that hits them, absorbing it and still drowning in air.  Their faces are cracked and dry, like desert ground.   I repeat myself, and I still don't know what I'm saying; it's what happens after the rain.   As the seasons change, and my soul takes flight, I believe that only the rain will cry my name;   maybe you could remember    how I used to be.
