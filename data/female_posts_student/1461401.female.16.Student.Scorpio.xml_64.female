Please excuse any typing errors you might find, but I'm not wearing my contacts right now and I'm not sure where my glasses are so in all honesty I can't read the screen. It can actually be kind of fun trying to figure out what's being said on different sites, but I've been to some of the ones so many times I would navigate them blind... Heh, like any of this matter.  Oh well, it happen. Well I'm going to make myself talk about things that matter then I really don't know what to say. You know what's sad? When a babysitter sees more of a child than their parent does. Yeah. That would suck...  I guess I'm done here. Sorry about the whole me wasting your time thing.  Meh, like I really care.  ~Kristin
