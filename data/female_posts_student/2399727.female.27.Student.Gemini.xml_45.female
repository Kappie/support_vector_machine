I got that answer too many times on high school career aptitude quizzes.   More seriously, I am suited to high school guidance counseling which is a recent interest, religious counseling and education, personal counseling and elementary school teaching.  Interestingly, professor wasn't on the list.  I have a meeting with the Career Counselor tomorrow to go over the results.
