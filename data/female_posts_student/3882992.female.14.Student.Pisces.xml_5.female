I got involved with the people that go there. Them becoming some of the most trustworthy people I have ever met. Him for example. Seemed like the perfect friend. Always there for me, whenever I would cry he would be there and he was always there, having my back, defending me. When my family started to die he was always there to help me cope. Then i just don't know what happened he like dissapeared in to his own little world. A world where  i mattered no more and where he would look down on me like the piece of shit that i once thought that i was, before he came along. Now my life is so much different. I so want to escape the "perfect place" the drinking, drugs everything. Not saying that i take drugs anymore.. The only thing  i do these days is smoke. I can't help thinking that one day everyone will want to do something else. Can't help thinking that one day the "perfect place" will actually be perfect. Where  i won't get involved with things that i don't want to do. I won't even have to deal with the pressure of being somebody that I'm not. I like the way I a right now. And  i really like the trustworthy people I described in the beginning.   Now I guess I just have to search for that "perfect place"
