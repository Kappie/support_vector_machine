Aaargh how much make-up is out there to buy? I'm broke but nevermind, I guess I can buy a toothbrush or something. I think I'm gonna stick with this old crappy computer - too much electrical waste, you better recycle your old one! Maybe if I save money by not buying a new pc my parents will buy me a piano to take to university... Hmm. *or maybe not*
