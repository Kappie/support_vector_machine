I was thinking, oh shoot, I should get my pager out of my lab coat just in case someone pages me.  I hardly ever get a page that I'm not expecting, but lo and behold, I have one new page from an unfamiliar number.  I'm thinking the worst--that Beanie's dead in his cage lying in a pool of his own blood.  I call back the number with my hands totally shaking and it turns out that it's Natalie calling about tomorrow's appointments.  She wanted to give my CT/rhinoscopy case to Jessica and was going to give me another case (I just hope it's not the renal failure one).  When she told me it was just that, I was so relieved, I was ready to give her whatever she wanted, including my firstborn child.  Well, I learned my lesson--CARRY YOUR PAGER AT ALL TIMES.  Oh man, I don't even know where to begin in telling about yesterday's self-imposed drama.  So I get rebuked by Dr. Rasor for the 3rd time in, like, 3 days.  I really don't think she's out to get me, but I do think she thinks I'm a naive little 3rd year who needs her hand held when doing anything.  This is mostly true, however, and I would gladly put up with a little hand-holding than to be thrown out to the sharks without any help at all.  The way things are now are better by far than how bad things could be.   This isn't the song I was singing yesterday, when I was thinking about why my letter of withdrawl to the Dean's office would say.  It would probably include a letter from a psychiatrist about how dropping out of vet school would be in the best interest of my mental and emotional health.  I was seriously beginning to think I was retarded.  I literally laid in bed from 10am when I got home from the VMTH until 6pm, getting up only 2-3 times to go to the bathroom and drink some juice.  I cried and dozed on and off during those 8 hours, but thought mostly of B and how awful I was to him and how upset he was at me.  He was only trying to be helpful and offer me suggestions, but I felt like he was trying to point out my problems and try to FIX them instead of encouraging me.  I totally bit his head off and he got fed up with me (I don't blame him--I was fed up with myself too).  Our conversation ended badly and he said that he was "just gonna go", which is always a bad sign.    We talked again a little while later around 3pm and things went from bad to worse.  He knew something was obviously wrong, but I didn't want to tell him that I was still dealing with my feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.  I was afraid he would think I was being a baby and that he wouldn't understand why this was hitting me so hard.  I still don't think he really knows why I don't take criticism well--I just don't.  So I kept on holding back my feelings.  The more he pushed me to tell him what was wrong, the more I didn't want to tell him.  So finally, both of us had enough and he was like, "Just do what you want."  This was a stab in the heart because that sounds exactly like what mom says when she  gives up on me .  Now this man that I care more deeply about than anyone is giving up on me.  Giving up on someone means that person doesn't CARE anymore what you do, even if you are harming yourself.  "Just do what you want" means "Fine, throw yourself in a bottomless pit, see if I care."  I don't think that B meant all this, just that he didn't want to try to get the answer from me anymore.  I don't think he was intentionally trying to be mean and I don't think he knows how much this statement hurts me.  His frustration is totally JUSTIFIED because I was being really difficult and stubborn, so in some ways, I brought this upon myself.   I guess I didn't want to tell him what was going on because I was afraid that he wouldn't like me anymore if I told him.  Yeah, it's easy to like anyone if you think they're cute and smart, but what about when lack of self-confidence and self-esteem surfaces?  What then?  Deep down inside I didn't think that B was going to turn and run, but I did think this was going to cause him to doubt our relationship.  For all I know, he does doubt us. The fact that he still wants to talk to me means a lot.  It means that he's willing to stick by me though the good times and the bad.    We talked a third time late last night and things are looking up. I explained to him that I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but just for someone to listen.  I think he took this too literally because he started to not say ANYTHING. At first I thought he was doing this to be defiant, but I think he thought that's what I wanted--a silent boyfriend.  No, this is the way that Jerry was--totally quiet when I was pouring out my heart, and I felt like I was talking to myself. Most of the time he actually was sleeping while I was talking to him though.  Then I tried to explain to him that I didn't want him to be silent, but then he started asking me rhetorical questions with obvious answers like, "Do you think veterinarians make mistakes?" and "Do you think an animal has ever died because of a mistake a vet made?". This sounds like when Dr. Rasor says to me, "Do you think you can do ALL your treatments done in 10 minutes?"  Well DUH. Instead of making a point, I feel like a kindergardner who is being scolded by the scary principle. You only ask simple questions to simple minded people because that's all they can handle.  When I am asked these kinds of questions, I feel like the other person thinks I can't handle difficult concepts (i.e. Christine=stupid). I really don't think I'm that stupid, but people have done a pretty good job of convincing me otherwise lately.  When I tried to explain where I was coming from to B, he got all confused about what he can and cannot say.  Goodness.  The last thing I want is to block communication between us and make him feel like he can't be honest with me.  Then again, I feel obligated to tell him what hurts me. *sigh* All in all, I think this has brought B and I to a new level of our relationship.  I'm not sure how he feels about all this yet, but I don't think these difficult times are a sign that we shouldn't be together.  It's good to see that he still wants to be with me  in spite of  how I am--not because I'm a "good catch".  This incidence has probably shattered the crystal pedestal he puts me on, but it's a good thing. It's time that he sees the ugly parts of me so he knows what he's getting himself into.  Knowing how patient he is, I think he'd be willing to work with me on my self-esteem issues instead of giving up on me.  This incident has totally kicked up the "dreaminess" factor up another notch.  Hopefully he feels the same way.
