At that time SARS was going on quite badly..and i made paper stars for him.In each strip of paper i wrote,praying to god,that he would come back safely from where he was,and i would gladly exchange half of my life for that..Stupid yeah? I guess love goes beyond all sacrifices,life or death..For when i love someone,i give my all,even when the tremendous hurt i recieve makes me wanna leave the world behind..  To the world, You may be one person. But to me, You may be the whole world.  Maybe thats wad it means..that how insignificant someone can be in this vast world.. yet when that special someone appears into yr life,it makes him/her seem like he/she is everything in the world..That even if the world was to be destroyed,all in yr heart that you care was the person that u loved.  When i reached into my pocket, i found that i was penniless. I was poor *so i think*, Till the dae i found you, For then, I realised, That i was the richest person in this whole world.  SOme things are wad money can't buy.Some things are never as precious until they were gone.Don't let the one u loved shed a tear,tell the person how much u care,for you never noe wad is going to happen tomorrow.Love hurts,especially when it's gone,without telling the other person how much u really cared deep in yr heart. *~.(,")Princess^Tiara(",).~*
