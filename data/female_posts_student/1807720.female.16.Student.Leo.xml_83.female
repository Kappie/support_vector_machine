Ben and Melissa were there, Doreen and Jim, and Ben's bother pete and his wife Judy, and their two kids were there.  It was pretty fun but when we opened our gifts one of the kids got a puzzle and I kept having to do it over and over again.  Like me and him would finish the puzzle and then he would dumb out the pieces on my lap and start putting it together again.  After he finished it for like the 10th time I said "Why don't you go show mom" but he just continued to dump the pieces on my lap.  After I finally got away me Ben and Melissa played Skip-bo which is like a really fun game.  It was fun and we AGAIN had lots to eat.  Then I just did some Social stuff when I got home and now all I have left to do is my Math but I don't feel like doing that at the moment cause I am on holidays.  Tommorrow I get to go shopping.     ___________________________________________________  I survived the crash, I survived the burn Survived the worst yeah baby but I learned Survied the lies, survived the blues Almost killed me but I survived the truth And when you wrote me off like I was doomed I survived you  ~Clay Aiken ___________________________________________________  Open to New Possibilities  Breathe and let all your worries fall away Just see what a difference it can make Let your mind just drift along today It’s OK and everything’s going to be just fine  Laugh a little and smile once more Walk along until your find that door It’s that one you’ve been searching for Here I can see it opening up for me  Step inside cause you’ve got nothing to hide Don’t be afraid it won’t hurt at all There’s a shinning light blinding me I have found my way and now I can see  Open your eyes and open you heart, I opened my soul right from the start Believe in yourself and belief in your friends It took some time but now the believing never ends  See in your heart and see in your mind That everything will turn out right with time Just open your hands and accept what comes Who knew the surprises of life could be fun  Follow your heart and follow your dreams Don’t turn away because you don’t believe Walk on the grass or walk on the road The choice is yours, go where you want to go  ~Vanessa ___________________________________________________  Somebody There  Tears descend from your eyes Let go of the hurting your concealing Be true to what your feeling There will forever be somebody there  They will seize you when you stumble And hold you to let you know they care When you think your lost and you think it’s over There will forever be somebody there  ~Vanessa
