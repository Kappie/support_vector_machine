I'm just really tired lately. My meds were upped from 150mg to 300 mg...and I think it's making me get evil-ass headaches...so that sucks. I should prolly bring some ibuprofin to school tomorrow...yah think? ^^  Anywayz...using google to search for pictures for my poems is being a pain in the ass. I mean..I'll find pictures I want to use...but my school is stupid and won't let anyone right-click so I can't get it!!! ;.; It makes me sad cuz I really like them too..and they'd be perfect for the poem...but I can't get to them! Grr...oh well...I'll just have to find a different one I guess.  But yeah...I dunno. Henry is having a birthday party with all his little friends on Friday...and I have work..thank god. I don't wanna go watch a bunch of little first graders run around Chuck E Cheeses...considering last year their main goal was to knock me over and sit on top of me...damn little kids.  But yeah...Jeremie doesn't have work that day either...damnit. I wanted to hang out with him this weekend...and I kinda can't cuz when we could hang out I'll be working...but I think we're gonna go to the mall on Saturday after I get my paycheck...since I don't work until 5:30 and my dad said he'd take me to the bank Saturday morning to cash in my paycheck...yay! I'm gonna have money! ^^ lol.  That's the only news I really have...I'm gonna put up a new poem and hopefully my new prose on DeviantArt soon...once I get some damn pictures...stupid slow computers...>.  And...now I'm done. lol. baiobaio.
