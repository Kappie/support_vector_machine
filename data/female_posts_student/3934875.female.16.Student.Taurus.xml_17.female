Firstly,in school, Im very proud of Nana that she got A1 for her O Level Malay Paper. But the fucking thing is that, Juliana,came up and asked her for the results, before actually turning to me and asked how did I fare too. When I gave tt face,she just looked at me down sarcastically and just went "ohh..." and walked away. FUCKER.. I think she must have heard me swearing her. She with her bloody not pretty face and that disgusting hairstyle on her.. Somebody ought tell her that she totally sucks.. Wait you,next yr when I take my O's I'll make sure I get a very nice A1 and dangle the cert in front of ur so-not-nice-looking face.      So i had study hour after that then i meet up with Nana to eat instant noodles cos we were so hungry.. Talked frm 3.30 to 5 like that then my boyfriend came over after his d and Nana went home. Chilled with him for awhile onli.. 5.30 went home.. Washed up and then slept until 8pm. Didnt realised I slept all the way.. Called my boyfriend, I also dunno why I called him rite after I woke up.. Report strength? Hahaha..      At dinner,I had an argument with my mum. Which is like so totally NOT my fault.. And she slapped me for it. Of course, I cried. Cos its been so fucking long since anyone slapped me.. And there she was slapping me for some argument so baseless. Well,so i locked the door cos I was so MAD!! 20 mins later.. Knock knock.. Someone came to apologize...       So now,Im chatting with my cuzzin Fursham. His dad is by right, my dad's cousin. But because my nyai breastfed his dad, and based on our religion, his dad and my dad are considered blood brothers.. Its complicated but yeah.. We are 'muhrim' and considered Cousins! Hahaha.. Take ur time to register tt. While at that, I just realised I have my POA hw to do.. and my Chem overdued hw too. And also, Im waiting for my dearest to sms me.. So I guess that shld be it for today.    ***Im missing Yayi so much.. Every day when I step out of the house, I see his old bicycle.. Yes..The bicycle he used to ride on.. And I often ride pillion and he would send me to the bus stop on it.. Even tho the bus stop is so near.. Thats how pampered i was by him.. Im also gonna miss remindin him that my birthday is nearing.. The only person I have no qualms telling that too is my Yayi.. But he's gone and I can say those words " Yayi, my b'dae coming soon.. Get ready my present eh.." no more. I just hope that in every birthdays of mine to come, he'll just come in my dreams and give me the wish I've been hoping for all this while ever since he went away and that is.. for me to keep to myself. Well.. I just miss him so much. Missing everything about him.. I miss him.. I love him.. (And no one can ever replace the empty slot in my heart cos there's no one like you, yayi...) *** //Spin me around till I fell asleep,then up the stairs he would carry me,and i knew for sure.. I was loved. If i could get another chance,another walk,another dance with him, i'll play a song that will never end.. How I love,love to dance with my Yayi again//    ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
