Slowly, but surely I brought you through.  Now she's back to rekindle that old flame.  She's got a different angle, baby, but she's playing the same old game.  Baby, don't be the victim of a foolish heart.  Don't let her lies get next to you.  She's trying to tear us apart and she's trying to make me a victim too.  Now I know she comes around here every time I leave, 'cause she knows she's still on your mind.  See, even a wiseman jumps in misery somewhere down the line, but only a fool will jump the second time.   Our affair is growing stronger every day, don't let her steal our happiness away.  Don't be the victim of a foolish heart.  Don't let her lies get next to you.  Can't you see what she's doing to you, boy?  Don't be a victim." ~ j. stone    Joss Stone is really rockin' my world these days.  Her and iTunes are where it seems to be at.
