The showers I speak of are the showers where one must clean themselves. You might ask, then are you like some grudge bucket? Well, I can be. Showers are so time consuming and it just is such a hassel to take a shower and then put make-up on and do whatever else comes along with preparing for the day. Maybe that is why I spend so much time in my PowerPuff Girl Pj pants, and my o so comfy Cubs shirt. Cause I just don't feel like taking a shower everyday. I usually never have any plans anyway,hmm maybe it's because I am a smelly person?!?!..whoa, I hope that isn't the case.        Moving on, today was a beautiful day! I love the colder weather in July, I could get used to it. It's so refreshing and it doesn't give me headaches like the hot weather does. Ahhh, just can't wait til Fall comes and then it will be like this everyday...and the smells, the yummy cider that goes along with it..ahhh. Ok, I better not say anymore,cause in all reality...its July,crud. JULY!? JULY 27th THAT IS! Getting closer to August which is when my dvd's for homeschooling come in. What is crazy is I am not supposed to start til September, but I can't wait much longer, I wanna start now. My brain must be fried or something. Did I also just admit to wanting to start school now? See, what this weather changing has done to me.        Ok, well I hope that this blog of the day hasn't made anyone think less of me or differently that is. I have the right to express my opinion, so ya know what? I DID!        Music Playin' in the Background: Kiss Me Fool-Fefe Dobson
