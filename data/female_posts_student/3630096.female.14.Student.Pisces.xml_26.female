Of him  I saw him every week Everytime, charming as he is Though in reality He is not really that charming But in my mind He is  One person is really charming His smile His eyes Filled with warmth and welcome with friendliness But I never spoke with him Never  Another was another him One of a quiet sort Never does his homework Never that obedient Rebellious but smart I knew he is up to it It's just that he never did  Confusing, relationships are I never gave a thought whether they are true The topic, the constant chattering Perhaps this will be over soon  I knew I'm just being naive Just wishful just a little hopeful... Just don't want to give up this thought...
