I totally can't drive for a while. My dad is being gay again, God, I hate him so much. You'd think he'd realize that I don't like him, and the only reason I can't wait to leave is so I never have to talk to him again. I told my mom that I don't want him at graduation again today. She got all mad and gave me the "but he's your father Melissa...blah, blah." I honestly don't care. I hate him and I hope he disappears. It'll make my life 100% better. I'm sure if he actually disappeared I would feel bad, but for now...nope. It reminds me of when Amanda Pringle was telling me this one story about Ryan S. OMG. He was supposed to help his dad unload this four wheeler off a trailer and he was screaming at Ryan to get down stairs and help. The whole time Ryan is thinking, I hope he has a heart attack, I hope he has a heart attack. All the sudden his dad's like, "OWWW!!' Ryan's like, Woo Hoo he's having a heart attack! Then his dad's like "Oww, my leg." Ryan's like damnit. Hey, his dad sent him away and he didn't have to help. That cracks me up. I hope he has a heart attack definitely makes my day. Dag, that kid is so funny! Well, I'm out!   Peace and Love, Melissa
