Before I jump into the woes of my life: I created this blog to flirt with the possibility of creating an opportunity to develop my writing, in case I seriously decide to be a writer. Okay! Now that that's out of the way... Hi. God, I am so screwed. What have I done? Why? Why?? I HATED him. Okay, fine, I despised him! I badmouthed him, I called him a monkey! And now I'm in love with him. Hello cliche, it's a pleasure to meet you, especially since you've made my life so wonderful thus far. Yeah. Great. Thrilling. Here's the real problem: We go to the same church. He's the pastor's nephew. I'm the only child of a single mother, who's currently divorced. My father lives in Australia. In Indian society, my mother and I are outcasts! His family is perfect. Not a single divorce. His two sisters are perfection personified. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY thinks they're the next best thing since bread. I'm really friendly with cliches today. Me? I'm nice, but I'm not considered as perfect as they are (I think). Don't get me wrong, I love them dearly, but i have to admit: It sucks. God, August 24th will mark two years since my baptism, and the day I realized I'd completely fallen for him. It's driving me nuts. I've considered, SO many times, just forgetting about him. It doesn't work. I can't stop! It's so unfair! Over the last year, I've seen him twice a week, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, at prayer meetings. Lately we haven't been going on Saturday nights, because Mom doesn't feel comfortable coming home around eleven pm or twelve am (We get home so late because we live an hour away from church). For the last five weeks, I've seen him once a week, on Sunday morning. He shaves on Sundays. He usually doesn't shave on Saturdays. God I miss seeing him when he hasn't shaved! Okay, to clarify, I will be sixteen on October 3, and he'll be twenty on April 20. Also: I have an obsession with his facial hair. Don't ask me where it all went wrong, because I'm as clueless as you. Up until this whole love thing happened, I despised men with facial hair. Speaking of which, he's on AIM right now. I'm thinking about whether I should IM him or not. I refuse to without an excuse, which I don't have, so I guess I should/will not. See, we're not allowed to talk, otherwise I might get a bad reputation, or everyone in church will gossip about us, and our...whatever thing we have, will be doomed from the start. I feel like I'm walking on fire, you know? It's like, wow, this could happen, we could end up together, BUT. There's always a "but." I mean, Pastor has said things that imply he wants us to get married, but couldn't it also be wishful thinking on my part?? That's where the doubt sets in. Luckily, I am strong in my Christian (pentecostal, to be specific) faith, and an optimist to boot, so I don't make myself too miserable, and believe that things will work out. Of course they will. There are just those times, when it's difficult to reassure myself. I spend all week convincing myself that he's not that great, and he's boring, masochistic, chauvanistic, a jerk, pig, monkey, etc. Then he looks at me once, and I'm mentally begging him to take me away because I'm his, completely his. It's insane and underhanded, the way he makes me feel, I tell you! There's an electric charge when we make eye contact. I can't stop blushing and smiling when he's near me, and believe me, it takes a lot for me to blush, considering my skin is not really the blushing kind. Just seeing him walk into the room makes my heart start beating so loudly I'm surprised my mom hasn't insisted on seeing the doctor about it. Not that she's heard it, which is, incidentally, the most surprising of all. I wish he would kiss me. It's really unlikely that that would ever happen before we got married (if we got married, actually), since he doesn't believe in dating, but I still wish, deeply, that he would. I'm dreaming of him every night, and thinking about him everyday, all day. He's the second thing I think about every morning (God is first; church does that to you), and the second to last thing I think about every night (again, God). Every time I see him, I always hope. My god, I can't believe that this entire thing is real. It seems like the kind of thing one would see as the plot of a blockbuster hindi film. Wow. I am now mentally exhausted. I am currently lacking the endurance needed to blog, so I'll leave you all (yeah right) with this: I have no idea what to do. I am used to being in control of myself, and having a plan, and now....now I have no plan but to wait, and that doesn't count as a plan at all, because it doesn't involve action. Talk to you later people!
