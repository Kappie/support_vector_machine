You look so beautiful tonight.  Remind me how you layed us down  And gently smiled, before you destroyed my life   Chorus: Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces)  Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces) pieces  Look at me, my depth Perception must be off again.  You got much closer than I thought you did  Iâ€™m in your reach  You held me in your hands   Chorus: (repeat 3 times to end) Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces)  Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces.(let me rest in pieces) pieces
