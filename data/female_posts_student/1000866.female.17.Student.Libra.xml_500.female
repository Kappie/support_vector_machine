I can listen to my music as loud as I want and talk to myself as loud as I want. I mean, I talk to myself anyway. I think my family has just gotten accustomed to it but usually I just ramble/mutter.   This week has been really good. I have hope for a certain...hmmm, a certain thing. Not a ton of hope, but definitely some. Tomorrow's already Friday too. That's amazingly amazing. I'm going to Brett's tomorrow for his party. That should be interesting/fun, and then the rest of my weekend, I am free. Well, except for my driving lesson Saturday during the day, but I rarely do stuff with other people during the day.  Today, I sort of sprained my ankle in gym. It hurt a lot, but it's ok. I'm sure it'll be better by tomorrow. I sort of landed sideways on it when I was coming down from a tuck jump. Owwie. And then everyone laughed because I landed sideways and then they realized I was actually hurt. Haha, I bet it looked pretty funny though. And then, you know when you hurt yourself and it really hurts badly for a minute or two and you just want to sit there in pain by yourself and have people not crowd around you. Yeah, well...that didn't happen. It was ok though. I mean, it's good people worry.   Ms. Gatto being the awesomely awesome teacher she is, gave me an extension on my paper. She just asked if I wanted it. She asked if I could write a better paper if I had longer and yeah...voila.   I'm liking jazz a lot more this year. Tom grew up a lot in the past summer. I mean, sure...sometimes he's immature but, he's definitely so much better now. I actually get along with him pretty well. I also like playing third part SO much more than second it's amazing. I'm just in a really good mood right now. I guess, my hope will probably come crashing down but...it's nice to be able to hope for it right now. I want to know, but I'm too afraid to ask. OK, I'm going to stop rambling about that now because...if I don't stop, people will figure me out. I know Chris will probably figure this out haha. He usually does. It's scary. I need to talk to him actually...I think I shall call him soon.  I think things are cool with Bryan and me. It's not really the same as before we started going out. Maybe it never will be, but who knows? I think we broke up the best way anyone possibly could, so...I'm definitely thankful for that.   Alright, I guess I should go eat my dinner. Yum. I'm not actually sure what I'm going to have. Maybe Mac and cheese. That doesn't sound too bad, but that sort of takes effort. More effort than just making a sandwhich. Well, unless it was a very elaborate sandwich...  OK, I'm done. I'll probably write more later. Maybe...
