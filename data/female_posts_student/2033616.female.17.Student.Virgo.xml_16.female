I got to school, not early as MK wanted but oh well.  I hung out with buds in the J-lab as usual, then Kayla and I went upstairs, passing Chad surrounded by a bunch of people that didn't want me there anyway.  Yes, then I had Precalc... and Eric did NOT tell me to shut up today, so that was encouraging.  I don't understand why he's so mean to me, I am really rather normal around him and I have never done anything to him so i don't see why he acts like such a jerk.  Lit and Comp was uneventful, except for Jessica playing "in focus, out of focus" which was funny.. and me and Amber making faces at each other from across the room.    During reading period i came across an interesting quote in I Kissed Dating Goodbye.  It was telling this story about always being positive; (i doubt Mrs. Benz would approve of that semi-colon) This couple is having financial trouble and when the husband gets home his wife has kitchen lit with candles and says "we're going to eat by candlelight tonight."  He soon realizes that actually what has happened is they have had their power cut.  The wife, in tears, tells him that she didn't want him to come home to the reality of his faliure, and that they will get the power back again but for now "let's just eat tonight by candlelight."  Joshua Harris ends by saying "I'm looking for someone who will light candles, not just curse the dark."  How true.  So then in German... it's German-American week... or something like that?  So we're doing a bunch of zero brain power stuff.  In chemistry we had a great laugh over our labs that the stupid study hall burned to a crisp.  7th per. AP Chem sure seems a lot more eventful than ours... but ours IS funny.  In ULE i actually did study for the PSAT today.. well sorta.  Then Kyle stole Hanson's "mindtrap" cards again to read in AP History... which besides that, was not fun.. lots of talk talk talk talk about stuff that's not all that fun.  Mrs. Leistra made an anology to siblings which Kyle found esspecially entertaining.. considering how MK and I get along in ULE.  Then there was Band.. i didn't have to play :-D.  And then the most exciting part was going home... I did homework and then had a March of Dimes Chain Reaction meeting.. which was entertaining.  Abby Hitzman and I are pretty much the only people from Roosevelt there, except for some sophomores, and Lord knows how they got selected for it.  Cam Stalheim must have actually remembered who i was this time b/c he waved goodbye to me.  That kid is just as goofy as when I knew him.  Then I came home and watched some MTV (televison? MTV? what has come over me?)  and my most favoritist Real World member is finally on one of the challenge shows.  Yes that's right.. favorite from when i actually watched MTV.  He's prolly gonna get kicked off soon though b/c he actually has standards and faith and all that and the rest of the cast is just a bunch of hot-headed, foul-mouthed, jerks.  But nevertheless he's there.  It's amazing how i can turn such a boring day into such a long blog... wow.. why didn't i think of this earlier.  Well I'm going to go read "Fall of the House of Usher" which (call me chicken) is really quite chilling so i don't really know why i'm willing to read it.. but oh well.   Happy dreams and good mornings to all, See ya on the flip-side! ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz
