We met in the elevator and instantly became friends! Her mom helped me make my bunk bed (aww so sweet.) Oh and can't forget about the entire Ethan scandel! Yes thats right he is a CHEATER, LIER, and a JERK!!! But oh so cute! And hmm what time was it? IDK picture this... Three blind girls, 12:30 at night trying to move an entire bed from the top bunk to the ground! And no it wasnt just the mattress, it was the entire bed, frame and all! Oh what an expierence! And what a view of the softball field! Jordan was VERY HOTT! Alex you are the best! And hey, no worries we'll have to get togehter and I want to see those pictures! I Love ya girl, keep strong, love the life you live, and never take anything for granted!
