Don't get me wrong. I love living in Northern Ireland. I think Belfast is a fabulous city with lots to offer both the resident and the tourist. Provided they'll let me, I'll stay here for years enjoying this beautiful city. It's just that a few people here get a little bit nuts around the 12th of July, and it preserves my faith in the Northern Irish and my love of Belfast to simply evacuate for a few days.  With my friend Elisabethin Paris doing a bit of research (slogging through archives and going mindless over a photocopier), I took the opportunity to re-visit another city that I love. It was fantastic catching up with her and just taking in the sights with a French native (Elisabeth was born near Lille). However, getting there was a bit of a nightmare -- a brief one but, well, here's how it went...  I packed my bags, set them by the door, and waited for the taxi to take me to the Europa Buscentre in Belfast. [Brief aside for those unfamiliar with Belfast -- the Europa Hotel to which the bus depot is attached has the notorious distinction of being the most frequently bombed building in Europe. Oh, and the Clintons once stayed there.] I bought my ticket. I boarded the bus and enjoyed the scenic drive to Dublin Airport. Nearly every drive in Ireland is scenic. It's such a beautiful island, one would be hard-pressed to take a two hour drive that  didn't  seem like the scenic route.  When I walked through the automatic doors, I was suddenly struck by a wave of memory that nearly had me in tears. The last time I had walked through those doors, I was with Ray, and he had just given me my promise ring. But, sucked it up, checked in and went to find a coffee. I avoided going to the one  we  had sat in while waiting for my flight to Philadelphia in May 2003. I passed the time reading Barbara Kingsolver's  The Poisonwood Bible  [a worthy read if you lay your hands on a copy]. I headed off to the departure lounge with about a half hour to spare. No worries passing through security, and I didn't have to remove my shoes like I did at Philly International. On arriving at the gate I discovered that the plane was delayed.  Groan . I'm not good with waiting. Forty-five minutes later, they announce the plane would be further delayed.   Groan  . The boarding call eventually came. The plane eventually departed. And we eventually arrived in Charles de Gaulle, which chose not to collapse on the occasion for which I am grateful.  I was hopeful that Elisabeth would meet me, but as we were a couple of hours late, I wasn't surprised that she had given up. No worries. I have used the RER and the Metro before -- and all by myself. I could handle this. Time was running out though, so I near ran (for once I packed light!) to the RER station to get the train into Paris and catch the Metro to my hotel.  But, the ticket agents are all gone for the night. I try to use the automatic ticket machines and when asked to insert my credit card. The machine says (in the politest French) that my card is not accepted. I ask the gentleman behind me to be sure I've understood. He confirms, and I attempt to withdraw the card. Tug, tug. Nothing. Dammit! give me back my card. The gentlemen behind me tries. Tug, TUG! Snap! Dammit! that's only half the card. We are both thwarted.  He apologies as he hands me the half of my credit card that the machine was willing to relinquish and sets off to find another machine to get his own ticket. I stare at what is left of my card for a few moments before heading off to find an ATM in order to use my Alliance and Leicester cash card to get the notes and coin I need to purchase the ticket. Actually, at this point I figured that I'd never make it back to the station in time for the last train and resolved myself to spend 40 euro for a taxi.  I head back toward the arrival gate because I remember there being an ATM there.Indeed there was one -- with an 'Out of Order' sign attached.Grrr! I went off to find another and then another and then yet another.I walked through most of CDG in a vain attempt to find an operational ATM. Most seemed to be simply shut down for the night. Others were broken. I was frustrated. After a trip on the terminal-to-terminal bus and being propositioned by the driver and yet another non-functioning ATM, I resolved myself to spending the night in the airport. I'd done it before -- in three different airports (CDG, Heathrow, and Dublin).  In the morning, I went to the Bureau de Change and changed what UK pounds I had for Euro. Enough to get a taxi to the hotel with a bit leftover. I arrived at the Comfort Hotel-Clichy and woke poor Elisabeth at about 8:00 a.m. I explained my predicament. She explained it to the hotel clerk. They let me check in, and I had a nice long shower and a good long nap.  I woke up in time to have lunch with Elisabeth after her morning of photocopying. We stopped at the bank and discovered that my cash card wouldn't work outside the UK. Banks are closed on Mondays in Clichy, so we made due with what cash I had and planned to call into the bank the following morning. We went out and had a good night -- saw  La Monde Selon Bush.  I love a good anti-Bush film!  The following morning the bank couldn't helpme and suggested we try La Poste. The post office couldn't help me and suggested I have money wired by Western Union. And, blessings of all blessings (decide for yourself where you think the good things in life come from; I'm not advocating subscription to any belief system here), my housemate Bron agreed to wire me cash enough to get me through.  In the end I hada great time in Paris. But, as is often the case, I owe many good things (and a few pounds besides) to the kindness and support of my friends. Most of you who will read this will do so because you're one of my friends. And, whether you are one of the ones who helped salvage this trip from the misery with which it began or not, I thank you -- for whatever kindness you have shown me even if it was only the kindness of letting me call you friend.
