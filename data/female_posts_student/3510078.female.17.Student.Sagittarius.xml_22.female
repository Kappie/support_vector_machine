I have a huge project to do allll tonight. should have started a week ago.   ...screw it. On a good note, I booked a photo shoot! September 16th. It's a hair show, and then a shoot for the salons, surprise surprise, but it's work, and it pays damn good. Better than anything I've had before.  Hope the jobs keep calling me like they have lately, so I won't have to waste MY precious time callin' THEM! heh. (I'm acting arrogant right now. AKA I'm kidding.) The party went well, orientation went well. I hope everyone else is well. and if not, call me cause I'll force ya to spill out yer guts. ;) it's all for you, my loved ones. POST! i'm BORED!
