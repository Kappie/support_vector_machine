Stripes of sunburned faces (however, if u put sunscreen on in the rite places, u can create a natural blush).  Sunglasses galore.  Daydreamin of that cool water ur gonna plunge into rite after school ends.  Starin at all the hot guys who jus get hotter evry summer in their swim trunks.  Sand up ur butt (thats more a beach thing than the pool).  The first dive of the day to soak ur hair.  Missing ppl from school (unlike all u party animals that read this, I don't go to summer parties much, although that doesnt mean I wont go if u invite me...depends on the timin).  Day trips to the beach to catch a few waves (body surfin, i'm not nick b.).  Summer barbecues with friends.  Drinkin lemonade poolside with friends.  Two words: diving board (I had a bit of fun with my sister Jenni's friends...we played chicken, the simon says for diving boards, and i made the mistake of tellin them that there were a lot of my classmates there, so they had me waddling like a duck, doin splits, pretending to be constipated and sum other embarrassing stuff).  Amusement parks.  Walkin on the beach at nite watchin all the hot guys set off fireworks.  Jacuzzi hoppin.  I suppose that's enough for now. Today's been pretty good.  It's not how I would have chosen to celebrate my bday, but still.  As I mentioned before, we went to CRA with my cousin (she and her family came down from Maryland for the weekend), ate sum pizza, had my favorite type of simple cake (good ole yellow cake, cream cheese icing) and ice cream (cookies and cream, second only to chocolate chip cookie dough), and I opened my presents.  I got too many to list, but among the hilights were insoles (for Shoney's), two seasons of  Friends  DVDs, some clothes, lots of makeup (I FINALLY got that under eye brightening stick from clean and clear that makes ur dark circles less noticeable), lots of face stuff and some hair stuff.  I tried out that foam conditioner from Dove, something I've wanted for awhile, and it's absolutely awesome.  Plus, I got some money from my uncle and my grandparents...I also found out that I'm making 7.50 an hour, not 6.50 till I officially switch to hostess, so I'm gonna have enough money after all.  Almost all my birthday money is goin towards Puerto Rico tho, cuz I will forget to save for it.  I also want a pair of birks so I gotta save up for those.  There's no way my parents will spend $100 or more on a pair of shoes so thats my department.   Well evry1's waitin for me to come down so they can sing happy bday, so i g2g.  Later.
