Just makes me hate war even more. And the way it made me think afterwards like how mainly poor people go into the army because they can't afford to go to college and they don't have a lot of other choices, I guess....and how no one in the governments families ever go.... I dont know. It just was a really thought provoking movie. I would recommend it highly. ...Jesus, and the idea the government can get away with some things....and maniuplate people's minds....just...frightening. But like I said, I am not going to put all of this into the FACT area of my mind, it just made me think. Yikes...the war images are just staying with me. Like, innocent people were killed in the bombs that we sent over to Iraq. How does that make us any better then the terroists? Both sides just ended up killing lots of innocent people. That's what just makes me really mad. People who weren't involved in the government or the war or anything get killed. They just get killed cause that's where they happened to be at that time. It really made me think about 9/11 all over again and how truly horrible that was. I knew it then, but it's just been reinserted into my mind. ...Too much war and hate. I know we all are never going to get along, but why drag innocent people into it? Let Bush handle his own problems with the men themselves. All these people are just...such wussys to make someone else fight their wars.  That's just my opinon and if you don't agree then that is ok with me. We all have different opinons and I accept that, anyone can think differently.  Oh and this is completley off the topic but when I got home, I was laying on my bed writing out notes to go with the pictures I am sending to friends in Colorado and it hit me. It really hit me that I am not in Colorado anymore. Like, I knew that obviosuly I was in Rhode Island, and normally it hits me the second I leave that I am not going to see these people again for a long time. But this year it was different, and it just now hit me. Especially since I won't be visiting them next summer, cause of my parents. I really miss them. 2 weeks with my friends..the people I care about most in this world...out of a whole year.....Its just not fair. Especially since we are all getting older. We're all branching out into our own ideas and our own lives. Soon we will be going to college...then what happens?..... 2 weeks is just...not a very long time in the long run.  God, I miss them terribly.
