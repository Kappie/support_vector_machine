I wish I had the time to share some of these stories with you. But, alas, that is going to have to wait until Thursday or Friday at best. Because it is after then, that I have had the time to sit down and formulate the best way to tell these stories. Stories that will make you laugh. And make you cry.  Stories that include senior retirement condo association members. And security guards who are ninehundred and ninety two years old. And it would take a week from Friday to catch anybody, and that's if they don't have a heart attack first!  However, today MUST be dedicated to writing my term paper. YES! That DAMN term paper I have been bitching and moaning about for what feels like weeks now! It's due Thursday, and tomorrow I'm spending all day with the family. And Wednesday it's back to work. So you see, time is running out.   Do  not  doubt my skills as a procrastinator. I am the queen. And I will take anybody on. And I will win.
