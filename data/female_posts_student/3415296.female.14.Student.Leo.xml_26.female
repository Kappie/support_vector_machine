I forgot to say, Mr. Leung tutors me and Candace to prepare us for IB. I guess he gives a lot of homework since it took me around 3 hours to finish it. Now I'm doing corrections, how fun is that? Very. I'm stuck on a question and Candace is out. So I guess I'm doomed.   I just noticed that, I give up easily, don't you think so? It's something I'm born with. Something that I'm not really proud of. I watched Spiderman2 yesturday. It was super good and I changed my name to alice - lotr.spiderman.freak.show. 'oo2 SPIDERMAN2 ROX! [ o4`=bff ] SPIDERMAN2 SPIDERMAN2 SPIDERMAN2 go watch it now!. I'm serious it was really good. I went with my brother because I figured no one else would want to watch it. Sara said she wanted to, but then my brother asked me too since his friends are all like on vacation I think. It was sweet but super dooper good. MJ is really cool. Same with PETER PARKER. I think I should get off this topic because I'm going overboard. I just remembered, Nima still has my yearbook. I didn't even read any of my entries yet. That's so sad. I better ask for it when I get the chance. Went to wonderland on the 26th with Sara, Jacqueline, Zoe, Candace, Krystal, and Roger   Roger was asking for some money from the girls because it was his and Candaces' 6th month anniversary, well 1/2 year in other words. He started going crazy, spent all his money, including some of mine, 10 bucks to be exact. He didn't even eat dinner, which is really sad. The sacrifices we make haha. Candace was really happy because she thought he forgot. She told me a few days later that Roger said "I love you" to her. She told me that she didn't say anything back but just smiled at him. I was happy for her. But she didn't sound happy. I asked what's wrong. She said she didn't say it back to him. She said that she didn't know what love is, and that she was too young to understand it. But she likes him a lot alot. I told her that she has to talk to him and tell him if he really loved her, he'll be able to wait until she felt the same way back. If he didn't wait, then he never meant a word he said. Candace asked me if I loved Safee, I said yes. Of course she had that OOooOO and awwww part going on, on the phone. It was true. I was in love. But I don't think he was.  Love is.. eternity. Love is a feeling that can't be controlled. It's passion. I had that, but I don't know what the heck I'm saying anymore. These days I cry a lot. Not hysterically. Just a few tears sliding down my face.   I forgot to tell you. I gave Safee the stars and yearbook. I worked pretty late the day before the last day of school. I gave it to Nima in the morning to give it to him at the end of the day, after I leave. Just, plans don't always work out. Mr. S. didn't mark my d.s and he said it could raise my marks if it was good. I waited after school for around an hour. Nima had to give it to him because he was going to leave. He did, but I wasn't out yet. When I was next to Sndiford at the computer, Annie came over and told me Safee was looking for me. Crap, first thing that came into my head. It took a while and the computer was busted, so he told me to send my project over on email. When I was ready to go, through the doors, I saw him. He was sitting on the porch.  I didn't want him to see me. So I..went outside through another door. I waited till he left, but he didn't. He waited for me, which was really weird. I waited for him. I started crying. I really don't know why. Emotions overpower me. He went inside the school, that's when I ran to Krystal's house. We were planning to go to Burger King I think. I wiped away my tears. When me and the girls were walking to the school to meet other people that were going, that's when Safee was starting to walk home. I wanted to run back and pretended I was invisible, but I couldn't. I didn't make eye contact.  Wow everything is not according to plan  that's what I thought. I asked Krystal and she said that Safee was coming to Burger King.  Crap . He came, and I was on the swings with Annie. Safee kicked Annie off which was so funny. He tried to talk, as usual. But never got to the point. I pulled him to walk. Maybe the swings made him nauceous? I don't know. We sat on a hill. Same place where we spent an actual whole recess together. He's always with his friends. He said Thanks or the present and hugged me. He said if we could be good friends. I said I don't know. I didn't know anything. seriously. Everything ended from there. Slowly drifting apart. I guess we still talk. Every now and then.
