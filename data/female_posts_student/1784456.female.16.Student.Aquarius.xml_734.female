Eeek! Hmm... watch the Road to El Dorado! YES! Wow, I have every thing worked out now... they're gonna go home never wanting to come back again! Woohoo! Nah, that's tight! I don't really deal with shy people very well... do I? Or do I? I just kind of blabber on and ask them meaningless questions every now and then. Are jam dougnuts more of a dougnut than cream ones? (Sorry about spelling!) So basically I'm like what I'm like on here.... but not. Wow, full circle! Madness! Dude, where's my car? I'll go find out what I can do to freak these people out! MUHAHAHA! *cough* bubi!
