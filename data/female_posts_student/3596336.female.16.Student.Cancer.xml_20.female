Soon... most of the original staff transferred, and most of the teachers of the new school is from Clementi Town Pri. i miss the school, the teachers, the fond memories the 19 yr old building brought to me.   When news of the merging surfaced, i was shocked but also relieved that i was the last batch.. so dun need to change the Uniform.(Clementi North Merged with Jin Shan Primary B4)(Jin Shan pri was originally situated at the Now Nan Hua Pri). It's just like killing a teenager. Clementi North was only 15 yrs old! How cld they close the school down?!  The school brought to me many fond memories... It also gave me opportunities to go overseas, tho i wasn't the elite students. i went overseas not once.. but TWICE! how lucky can i get? i remember after recess, my frens and i would head to the field and spend the rest of the break time there playing. we played croc, balancing act.. all the childish stuff. The guys would play soccer or basketball.. Oh! did i mention the canteen food!? Geez! it's very delicious! i miss it sooo much! We'll eat "gan mian" with loads of chilli  tomato ketchup.. Oh the drinks were very cheap too! u know how much? 20 cents only! and it's the size of those plastic cups u see in coffeeshops! Oh how i miss it...  I remember in primary 3, sitting with Zhimin and Grace, i sneaked food up to class to eat. it was the cuttlefish i remember really clearly.. hehe. That was sooo fun! Primary 5 was the best year i've ever had. i would play and laugh right in front of the teacher with my then-pals. But my results fluctuate. so p6 had to go to the 2nd class... wasted right? but nvm.. i'm having fun here in kent ridge..  haiz.. how i wish Methodist Girls' would allow alums to go back to the school to reminiscence.. how i wish.. i wish i wish.. i MISS U CLEMENTI NORTH!!!  *psst, i cut my hair by 3 inches! lol. Not that short. dun worry. kekeke.. wah.. my distest-tation for _ _ _ _ _ is getting deeper.. B****!    LPY
