Feel - Robbie Williams 2. Stop Stop Stop - The Hollies 3. Heard It Through The Grapevine - Marvin Gaye 4. Misfit - Amy Studt 5. Tainted Love - Soft Cell 6. 9 To 5 - Dolly Parton 7. Generation Sex - Divine Comedy 8. Act Naturally - The Beatles 9. Stupid Thing - Aimee Mann 10. Walk This Way - Aerosmith (with Run DMC)  All that tells me is what I already knew; I have an eclectic taste in music. Not exactly rocket science.
