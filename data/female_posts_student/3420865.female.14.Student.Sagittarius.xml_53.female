(actually, that's kindof harsh...so just laugh now to save yourself the trouble.)  and now, i shall copy erin and post some alexisonfire lyrics. however, they're not the "nicest" ones that i could find. they are, however, the best.   this is really only all we have:  day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. you had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. these typed letters, beneath me. fuck with these buttons and knobs long enough, and maybe things will turn out fine. hide behind your crystal screen and blow kisses at me. remember what we said wouldnâ€™t happen? write your name on my chest in kerosene. spark a match and you will never be cold again. this is really only all we have: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. you had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. gag and destroy me, gag-me. i have a large collection of thunder, that i stole from your window sill.   kayte.
