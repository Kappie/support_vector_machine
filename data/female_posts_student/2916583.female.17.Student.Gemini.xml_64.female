I got everything straight today.  I'm in everything I wanted to be, and not a single class I didn't want to be in.  However, this victory is somewhat tainted by the reactions I'm going to get come September.  Before you all (and I can think of some of the pissed off people who would do this) gather your pitchforks and torches and pay me a visit, just know that I did it to make me happy, and I would rather be happy than try to make people happy.  I would have had a miserable senior year had I just done some things for others.  In the end, if it's your happiness or mine, I'm going to pick my own.  It's selfish, but I wouldn't be much use to anyone anyway if I was mopey or angry all the time.  Although most of you are probably doing an eyebrow lift like The Rock (the confused look, Deanna), a few of you know what I'm talking about, and I hope you understand.  If not, I'm certainly not going to lose any sleep worrying about you.   I'm going to check to see who's winning in the polls.  I'll bet that not one of you left a comment though.  Oh well, I know that, in my heart, Friends is your choice.  Later.
