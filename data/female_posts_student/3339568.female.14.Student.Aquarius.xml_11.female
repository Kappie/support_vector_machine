Hannah bailed out on me and dind't come ova becuase she got food poisining from eating sum random deep-fried carrot ball. Silly, silly. She knows not 2 eat random weirdo food when ur waitressing. Tsk. Tsk. So that helped accentuate mi depressed mood. I got Gem 2 come ova so I could mask the sadness. It came back of course. Always does. This time in Church. I was singing and i felt this overwhelming sadness come over me, because the music made me think about stuff, and i didn't want 2, i just wanted it 2 be me and God, no-one else, but I couldn't help it, and it was weird because i felt so sad I couldn't stand any more, and I sat down and just prayed and cried a bit (but not so much so that evry1 would notice) and God helped and when I got up I still felt a bit sad but better, and it was just me and God this time so all those thoughts could get out of mi head 4 a while. It was good.  But Dance was fun. Gem and I rocked up and Pip L and Jodie and Nat and Ash were there and they had a table and they had bought lunch, so we joined in, they had tinned pears, crackers, vita-weats, philadelphia cream cheese, yoghurt, plain chips, and caramel tim-tams. It was yummi, 'cept it made dancing hard!! The dance was majorly complicated. I dunno how I am eva gonna get it!! Ahhh... And we spent a lot of the time rolling into each otha, funni, but we were paying 4 it afta with lots of pain!! I'm so physced about doing this dance at EBN next term! Yay.  Nite Church was cool. Well apart from the aforementioned incident, but y'know that got betta as well. Luke and I got more talking time than we usually do so that was good :D  Sucked in 2 every1 who had 2 go to skool 2day. I went and saw 'Mean Girls' with Bubs, Loz,  urlLink Hanni ,  urlLink Casey  and Jess. it was quite good actually, realli funni. Im getting the DVD off Julia, along with 'Secret Window' (REALLI good, 1 of mi new fave movies, i suggest every1 see it) and 'Honey' (nutha good movie, but prolly just 4 tha girls, or guys who wanna perve on the half-naked girls in the movie and r into hip-hop...weird :D) So yeh, that was mi Sunday and 2day. Blogging off, Beth  p.s I'm so excited bout what Gemma told me last nite!! Ahhhh....
