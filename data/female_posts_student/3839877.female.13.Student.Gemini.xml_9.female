I think i'll just stay walled up in my room the whole time, i'm not really social, prefer being alone. I might go out for 15 minutes then come back inside, but other than that, i'm staying right here in my dark, comfortable room, alone...  Hmm, i'm just in a really strange mood, I feel like calling myself Satan's Lost Angel, Satan's Missing Angel, Satan's Missing Female Soul. ect. ect.   7:31 PM Later On... I went outside for several minutes, listening to my IPod and pretty much ignoring everyone. I didn't talk with my new relatives from Canada, didn't seem like they wanted to meet me. But, there is 20+ people outside, I don't want to be around my family right now, I keep getting these cold glares from Jovondai and her friend. Jovondai has always been such a bitch to me, always rude. I think she hates me. She's not my list either... Cheria is okay, hyper, she's so spiffy and cheerful. Preppy, popular-ish. Ugh.  All I want to do is RP or talk to someone, that's all I need. Just to have some human connection with someone other than my family. An actual conversation. Luke is excellent for that, though it seems these past few days he's been so busy, I just don't want to bother him. But he is all I really have that understands. Selle does, but not the way he does. They both have ups and downs, I don't know. I just want to talk to him...  At least this worrying and shit has stopped. Thank god for this medicine.   7:55 PM Went back outside again, out of total boredom.  Hmm ate two hot dogs, listened to some more MM. More cold glares, why is everyone so worried about me? Its like they think i'm going to commit suicide right in front of them or something. All I want to do is talk wth Luke, or someone. My PS2 is completely fried, lightning must've hit it. Though i'm not upset as I never played it that much anyway. I think i'll go back outside in a bit. Though, I don't know.   8:34 PM Bored to death, I went outside yet again, and i'm not going back. Updating this is much more fun.  I had to listen to HipHop and R It completely blocked out my MM because that's how loud it was. So I came back inside. Everyone in my family hates Rock, Metal, Alternative and Industrial. And i'm still a bit hungry, I should've eaten more. -.- I think i'm going to screw around on Furc and try to find something to do. To top that off I have to listen to my family scream and shout.    9:09 PM Nope, didn't go outside. I'm sitting here, listening to firecrackers shoot off, people screaming, shouting asnd cheering. I absolutely hate it. > Alone, bored... Messing around on Furc. Dreamweaving a bit. Just finished downloading  urlLink modules  for  urlLink Messenger Plus!  I'm currently downloading a crack for Adobe Photoshop CS. ^^  1:55 AM Kinda tired... Whee! Did a bit of RPing. God, I missed good RP. ^^ Cheria, Jimmie  I got into several stupid, but heated debates. 1. How much money prostitues make. 2. Why people kill prostitutes. 3. How many people are in the world.  Some others, which I can't quite remember at the moment. Then we watched the Nick Berg execution.  WHEE! That was some awesome shit! ^^ I think i'm going to bed now. -.-   urlLink DeviantART   urlLink Diaryland   urlLink LiveJournal
