I made sweet tofu stuffed with rice and dried tofu, "crab" wrapped with seaweed on top of wasabi spread rice balls, egg roll, cucumber roll, dried tofu and cucumber and dried fish and veggies and egg and some yellow vegetable i do not know rolls.  I put too much wasabi with the cucumber and one of the other rolls wouldnt stop unwrapping.  Well then...guess it's back to the Easy Bake oven for me...yes...cookies the size of loonies and cakes as flat as paper the size of a cd.....
