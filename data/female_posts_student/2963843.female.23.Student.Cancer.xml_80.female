I think I remember why I'm so anxious about the meeting.. I just recalled that our last meeting went very badly.. Forget about the details, but we just didn't click.. Gosh lucky its only the movies or I'll just die right there.. Not much conversation involved when you are at the movies..  I will survive!  School starts on 5th of july! And that's only two more days! Yikes!
