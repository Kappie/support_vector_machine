You are Walt Whitman!  Champion of the Transcendentalist American Ideal, Walt Whitman is one of the first poets to use the "free verse" form in America.  He has been imitated, but will never be duplicated, just like you!  Except for by everyone else who gets Walt Whitman ;)    urlLink   Which famous poet are you?
