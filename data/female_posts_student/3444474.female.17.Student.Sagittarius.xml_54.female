I love quick downloads, God Bless DSL, :D  In other news, I feel like driving. Right now. It's a shame I do not have access to the car. Oh well. What I lack in a vehicle...well I can't really make up for that, because I won't have a car for awhile. Meh.   My boss just came in, oi. I wonder if it's really okay that I do this during office hours. Oh well, I'm sure it's not a huge deal.   mmmm, damn this song is sexy, wooo! I just want to shut the door and dance to it.   That's not a bad idea, maybe during lunch I'll do that.   More in the afternoon when I can think clearer with more coffee in me.
