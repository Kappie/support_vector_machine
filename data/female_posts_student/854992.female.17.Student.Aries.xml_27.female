Cease to make decisions about anything and everything from your favorite color to the paramount impedimenta in life.    Do not hate. Do not love. Do not vow.    It is almost guaranteed that within five years whatever it is you have objurgated, loved, or sworn upon will changed. A "favorite" color will have changed twenty times. Sadly, the love of your life will change, too. And the pact you made back in your puerile years in elementary will most definitely flop. You    swore to be drug free    back in your sixth grade D.A.R.E. program. Just wait until you hit a low point in your life, your best friends might be a pack of marlboro lights.     Don't speak incessantly about your goals and ambitions. Don't reveal yourself to whomever asks. And never volunteer information about yourself. You'll find that often times, your dreams will be reflected in another person whom you don't care much about. Just    don't    do it.          Remain    mysterious .   That, however, does not mean serious. Laugh. Scream. Shout. Do not live each day like it is your last, because quite frankly if you knew you only had    one day to live   , you would most likely do outrageous things (ex:    have sex ,  get wasted ,  rob somewhere   ). Also--smile. Remaining mysterious doesn't mean you're a bitch. Smile, it's cute.          Stand out. Do not be ordinary, wherever it is you are. If at the beach, wear a swim suit made from seaweed--or none at all. Or wear you hair in a    mohawk    to your aunt's funeral. Or whilst simply wearing jeans and a tee-shirt to a football game, sport fifty bracelets on your left arm and    wear shoes the color of toilets    in antarctica. Or, find your own (probably more normal) ways of standing out.    Never conform  .        Swear.    Not around your parents, siblings, bosses, or anybody older    en général   . Swear during midnight poker games or on girls night out.    Swear at shitty drivers  .       Be a martha-friggin-   bitch   . You deserve it sometimes. Cut off people while driving,    give them the finger   , and honk like a mad man.    Don't do it all the time. Just certain days. Tuesdays and Saturdays are good.       Fall in love with all kinds of    weirdo music    regardless   of the stereotypes, the trend, or what your friends are listening to. Learn how to play odd instruments like    wine glasses    or even the accordian.          Pretend like you are Celine Dion and    sing at the top of your lungs in your car, with the windows down   , of course. If you don't know the words, make them up. If you don't know the song, act like you do. And if the goddamn radio just doesn't work, make up your own    ode to life .       Don't fall into the traps the    soi distant hotshots    of the world have set for you.                          to: [you]--hopefully it will clarify.  sui generis , baby.
