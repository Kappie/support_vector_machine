Oh well, I'm on now and I guess that's all that matters...right? No, I guess things could be a lot better. Tyler says you can always be happier...but sometimes I think I couldn't be happier anywhere else on earth. For example, when I'm with him, we don't even have to be doing anything and I'm perfect. It's just my surroundings I guess. But anyways, Friday was kind of crazy. Brock had a band practice at his house and he left kinda early from it and everyone else just kind of happened to hang around afterwards. I didn't even realize Brock had left, but thenSteve and Trena got home...and they weren't too happy that we were all there...without Brock. So we tried to explain that we didn't know Brock had even left but they didn't believe us. So we left, and Damian, Jesse, Fox, and I were on our way to Mike James' house and Steve called...apparently someone went into his bathroom and knocked over some jar that had his wedding ring on top of it and he couldn't find it. Well, we didn't know what had happened, so Damian finished his convo with him and hung up. He called later and Steve had found it...good deal, because the blame could have easily been pushed over onto any one of us, and that would have sucked. So anyways, we hung out at Mike's the rest of the night...it was kind of boring but what can you expect? Then, Saturday we all went to Kim's party thing that she had...which I thought was pretty boring too. Bitter Ending got to play and so did Jade's band whatever they're called, so it wasn't a total drag, but Jesse insisted we leave at 8 o'clock which again angered me. So many stupid little things can set me off, maybe I'm bipolar or something. Not sure, doesn't really matter I guess...I'm breathing and it gets me through. Anyways, when I got home I watched Labyrinth and then wentto bed which brings us to today...Sunday. I slept until 1 p.m. because I was really tired, though I'm not sure why, it's not like I stayed up very late. When I did wake up though, the family was eating lunch...barbecue ribs and some kind of steak...ick...so I fixed some peanut butter and jelly and then came down and fiddled with the computer fora couple of hours before I finally got it working. I had to do a restore on it, and that made it kind of work...but anyways, I'm bored yet again, so I'm going to find something productive to do...hopefully. Until my next post, later dayz.
