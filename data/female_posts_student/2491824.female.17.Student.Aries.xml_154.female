I had my Algebra2 exam today. It didn't seem bad, so that means that I failed it horribly. That's how it always is--the better I feel I did on a test, the worse I actually do.. and vice versa to some extent..  Blue Man Group is on tv. Man, they are so awesome. I want to go see them live sometime...  I can't wait until Tri-County... :D Then right after that, OMC! ...Two weeks (maybe in Florida), then Alpha1! Wheee!  Can I get a how-how?
