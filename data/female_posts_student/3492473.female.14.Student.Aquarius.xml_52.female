I don't know if it is true or if I'm just setting myself up to fall down  again.  But there is one  big  reason to say no. Although, it's not seeming to bother others. I'm sorry, I wish I could explain in detail but thenthings would getpretty screwed up. So today I decided to clean out my closet and get rid of all the stuff that I didn't want anymore or didn't wear anymore or didn't fit in anymore. Everything was going pretty well... until the end , that is. I went to go try on this awesome skirt I have and I had the hardest fucking time getting it over my legs. The thing that upset me most about that was  because it fit me two months ago.  So within two months my legs got bigger. I know it's not fat and that it's muscle from soccer and running but it really frustrates me because I have the hardest fucking time looking for clothes with the way my body is. Ah... And I'll upset and worried because my grandpa isn't doing too well. So all of my family is just really cautious and scared for whatcould happen next.  Oh god please don't...I don't know if I could handle losing him... I'm just in a bad state and I'm too worked up to even add a poem...sorry guys...
