My postive attitude is coming back, and hell I feel like I have the confidence to do anything right now.  Yesterday I went to see "Elf" with my neighbours and stuff and I think I did something that morning too but I can't remember what it was that I did.  Today I went to Melissa's house and Doreen was there and took us to Fabric Land and Fanny's Fabrics to get some patters cause Melissa is making some runners for the table and wanted some patterns for the window drapes for her and Ben's new house they are getting built.  Then we went to North Hill mall and then Market Mall and it took us like 50 stores and 5 times around the mall for me and Melissa to pick out Mom's Christmas gift.  There were so many people at the mall too.  And then we had to look for dresses for the Wedding because I am the Bride's Maid, but after lunch we were so tired that we didn't look long and didn't really see anything that was the color we were looking for.  So I went back to their trailer her and Ben are living in and Doreen went back to Canmore, then my Mom picked me up and went back to my house.  After dinner the neighbours came over to visit and we had a ton of food.  Tommorow is going to be a long day too.  Chels, Monet, Sarah, and Mike and coming over for a while and later I am going to see "Something's Gotta Give" cause it's cheap Tuesday at the Coliseum.  There is this song by Britney Spears I was listening to and it's soooo good.  It has so much truth to it and the like "And everytime I try to fly I fall" just so describes what I felt for like the entire Semester.  But after holidays I think I can totally get it together again.  I just feel so awesome right now.  I am rested and not tired, and just HAPPY.  That's right - HAPPY!!      Everytime  You notice me And take my hand So why are we In strangers' land And love is strong Why carry on without me  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby, oh  I make believe that you are here Is the only way that I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And the sun smiles on me  Oh, at night I pray That soon you'll face will fade away  And every time I try to fly I fall Without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all  ~A Song by Britney Spears
