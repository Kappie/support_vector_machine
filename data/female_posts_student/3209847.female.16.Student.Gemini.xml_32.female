I had such a GREAT day yesterday. Everything just went well. I'm very excited about it. So anyway....  School: -      This is my last day, may 21, of computer science. tear? nah -      Yesterday *Lolley interupts to say hi to everything and everybody out there, ...so um hi* was a really good day at school -      We're reviewing in all my classes now, so its pretty boring -      Elections were yesterday! I voted for chelsea duran, lauren messer, may moayad, and alex boyd-rogers -      That's basically it  So i had an amazing day yesterday because i got to see sarah. I hadn't seen her since monday. I missed her so so so so so so much!!!! she picked me up from my doctors appointment. It was so funny!! ahem! anyway, we went to her house, and i got to eat ramen noodles and more food. yummy. Her house is my sanctuary. After that, we went to go see desperate measures. Oh, i wore her clothes. They're so much more comfortable than mine. We got sno-cones on the way to casa manana.   The play was, well, pretty bad. It was flat, dull, had no life in it. We really didn't enjoy it. There were a few parts that were really funny, but the rest was just tiring to watch. So we left after the first act and went to barnes and nobles. I love looking at books with sarah. I wanted to buy her everything she wanted in there. She has such an incredible mind, brilliant. I just love seeing her glow. Okay, i'll be done with that now.  Sarah, i had a great day yesterday. You are the best ever! I am so lucky and so honored to know you and be with you. Thank you for giving me a chance!  I'll update later, today should be a good day too! I get to see sarah again!
