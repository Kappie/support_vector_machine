I’ll never give up!!! Till death comes to me I’ll stand and fight Just to see you smile Free from your aching soul I’ll face the Gods I’ll face the Demons I’ll face them all My will is stronger than my deepest fears I won’t lie down I won’t stop Till my last breath I’ll fight for love!   ]-[ellMistress * Angel Of Darkness
