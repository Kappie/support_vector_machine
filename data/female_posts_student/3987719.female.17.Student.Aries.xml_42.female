The good news is that Texas and Anaheim have taken a game each from their 2 game stint, and now the A's get to host the Rangers in Oakland for three games with Texas coming off a loss to Anaheim at home.  Redman got the start, and despite a rough begining and end, he managed to stay out of harms way most of the game. In the first inning he allowed Ichiro a lead off single followed by a Winn single placing runners on first and second. There would be a calm before the storm though, when Redman got Boone to pop up for an infield fly rule, but lightening would strike when a passed ball would get behind Catcher Adam Melhuse, advancing the runners to 2nd and 3rd. Thunder would clash on a Edgar Martinez single to left scoring both Ichiro and Winn. Unfortunately, for Martinez the storm didn't descriminate as Eric Byrnes got the ball into McLemore at 2nd in time to rain on his parade. The damage had been done though as the Mariners took a 2-0 lead after the 1st.  Seattle would go down 1-2-3 in the 2nd, but wouldn't go down quite as easily in the third, loading the bases witha two out rally before Ibanez would ground out to McLemore.  Offensively, the A's didn't start out very well either.In the firstlead off man, Kotsay popped up to Boone at 2nd, followed by a McLemore walk, but don't get excited he was stranded after two strike outs.   In the 2nd inning the A'smanaged toload the bases, Crosby and Durazo both singled, and Kielty would reach on an error.The next 2 battersproceded to record 3 consecutive outs before they were able to bring in any runs. Byrnes would go down looking, and Melhuse would ground into a inning ending double play.  In the third, fourth, and fifth innings only4 men would reach base. Chavez would be stranded in the 3rd after a single. In thefourth inning Crosbyhit a single followed by a HBP for Byrnes despite raising their OBP both would be stranded as would McLemore who singled in the fifth.   The A's came alive a little in the 6th, well at least Bobby Crosby did blasting a two run homer to left scoring himself and Scott Hatteberg whom led the inning off with a single. Out of the following four batters only Kielty would reach base on a walk.  Franklin would come out after 6 innings of work, but Seattle reliever Sherrill would hold the A's to just a walk in the seventh. Then in the 8th he'd record two outs before issuing a walk to Kielty, and then Sherrill was replaced by Hasegawa who would strike out Byrnes, the first and only batter he would see.  In the bottom of the 8th, Boone would hit a homer out to centerfield, scoring himself and Winn who previously reached on an error. The next two batters would fly out to end the inning.  Going into the 9th as the visiting team the A's would face a tough spot against closer Eddie Guardado. Seattle would make a few defensive adjustments, bringing in Jolbert Cabrera to play third switching Spiezio to first. Damien Miller would pinch hit for Melhuse, reaching base on a single to centerfield. That'd be the end of the line though as Guardado would get the next three to fly out and pop out for final three outs.  Redman would take the loss, going 8 innings with 4 earned runs on 7 hits and 4 base on balls.  Hasegawa would be credited with the win, and Guardado would pick up his 18th save on the year.   Final Score:  Seattle 4, Oakland 2
