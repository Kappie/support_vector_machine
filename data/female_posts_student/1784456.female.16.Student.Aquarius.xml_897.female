They're showing Rayearth, the original manga of that Magical Knight Rayearth was done by CLAMP so it should be good! But it's on at 00:05! What are they trying to do to us?! Grrr... stupid Sci Fi channel! But hey, at least they're actually showing anime, it's almost extinct apart from that over in England. Oh yeah, tacky stuff like Hamtaro and Pokecrap are still around though... but I'ld be much happier if they became extinct! Hehe... I figure if I stay up till 23:00 then I can get most of the anime recorded... well you've gotta give me points for trying! I might as well just stick the recorder on when I go to bed and leave it to record 3 hrs. Damn that! Why can't it be 6? Eurrrgh... sick coming up, yeah that's why I'm at home. I feel really sick, can't stop coughing and have a heavy head... reeeally bad cold! Blueeergh... damn I do feel really sick...  urlLink http://www.allhallowseve.com/makeup/index.html  so... pointless! I don't even know why I found it!
