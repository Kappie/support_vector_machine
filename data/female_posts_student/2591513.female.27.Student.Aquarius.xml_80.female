I thought instead of buying pointless snacks, we might as well spend money towards soemthing healthy and good.  Thank goodness for that.  I think I feel a lot better just knowing we have a better diet.  Now we are going to make french toast for the kids with fruits and milk on the side for them.  It is sad, I got so caught up with everything going on in my life, I neglected our eating habits.  I hope you are all doing well.  Oh and I just wanted to congratulate my sister on her 4.0.  I knew you could do it.  I just keep telling you to believe in yourself, if I were half as gifted and as intelligent as you, this college stuff would be a walk in the park.  Also, congrats to Mica for doing well in her classes.  I had no doubts in your ability to do well.  You too just needed to believe in  yourself.  I guess that is the secret to life, the secret to unlocking the dorrs to your potential, is to first believe in yourself...then everything falls into place.  Have a HAPPY Friday everyone.
