But the song. The song in the end. oh god. it's a very very...   mad world.   I love alex. It's just like, I think about him, and I have to remind myself to breathe. And the funny thing is, I didn't always feel like this, even when we were first going it. It's like, the more I get to know him, the more I want to be with him. I like this feeling. It think it's what people really mean, or try to mean, when they talk about love. I like this feeling. Just a little more proof that it's a....   mad world.
