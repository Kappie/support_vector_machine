They love me and would probably be comfortable with it, but I can never be sure. I don't want to upset them, butI don't want to hide it forever. I hate hiding it, like it's some horrible secret, when really, it's not! It's a wonderful thing and I embrace it fully, but being only 13, I assume my parents would just say, "You're too young to know what you are!". I love them and they love me but I still don't know how to break it to them. I don't know if they'd be happy, disappointed, or be like, "Oh...ok! Whatever makes you happy!" I think they would probably say whatever makes me happy, but there's always that slim chance that they'll be disappointed in me. I love them sooo much and I don't want to hurt them. All my friends know, and they don't care, but with my parents, it's different...>. .
