To the point that you cry? Well maybe not. Especialy knowing that you would never be more then friends with that person. Going out with a person seriousily in Grade 9 is sick. Its not right. But you can like a person strongly. And I feel like a complete idiot. But it really fucking pisses me off. I just want to yell and scream at that person. Yell FUCK YOU, and anything else that comes to mind. Its so stupid. So unreal. Then try having that person liking your best friend alot? That doesn't bother me so much anymore, I am used to it. But the funny thing is, is that he likes my best friend the way I like him.... I think. LoL anyone reading this must think im crazy. But I'm simply expressing the way I feel. And what is wrong with that? Nothing. Life is so stupid. Sometimes I think that i should just stay home and continue to hate the world. I want to punch him. Punch so hard that it hurts. IT FUCKING PISSES ME OFF. I hate him for it to. Which isnt right, but screw it. That is all I really have to say.  Hannah
