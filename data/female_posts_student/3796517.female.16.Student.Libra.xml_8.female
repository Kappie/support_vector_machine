Bob yells at me for the most meaningless things and the classroom is completely wastless. We did drive past Katies house though. So Drivers ED sucked, except for driving past Katies.   First day of work! I've been conquered by Pathmark... Kind of sad but I'm making good money here. The only thing thats bad about it is I had to join a Union. That pissed me off, Pathmark consists of Communists. The Union has one benifit though... I   CANNOT   get fired unless I do something like steal, which I won't. I am getting $7.00 an hour for pushing shopping carts to the front of the store while listening to music or talking on the phone. I love it. I got Taco Bell for lunch. Peter might be getting a job. He doesn't care about joining the Union, I don't think he realizes that means Union dues and other shit which means...   money out of paycheck!!   I got home and relaxed. I think I'm sick so I'm just going to take it easy. Before I forget.................... I'm meeting the stalker tommorow at 7:00PM at the Downtown. I can't wait to end this whole thing. Crazy stalker bitch!! >:O
