SORRY i didnt know that crest organge whitening toothpast was "cool" over the aquafresh. Next thing, my mom is like "julia why cant u ride the bus this morning with the boys instead of me taking you??" UMM MOM MAYBE I CANT BECAUSE A-MY KNEE HURTS AND B-UR TAKING ME oh well..who calls right before we walk out the door...JOHN, now its not that i dont like john, cuz i like him a lot, i just hate it when my mom isnt a "mom" because she spends her days and nites and dinners and EVERYTHING with that one man and HIS family that she forgets she has her oown damn family..ugh...well he calls and i answer and shes on the phone saying she needs to take me to school and if he would like a cup of coffee and how she'll see him at breakfast. OOH SO U WANT ME TO GET ON THE BUS AND HURT MY KNEE MORE SO U CAN GO HAVE BREAKFAST WITH JOHN? i started yelling at her and just going off because honestly, my feelings were hurt. She then gets all mad cuz im yelling at her for "having a life" and how my knee probably doesnt hurt, that im just making it up to make her do things for me, like take me to school. thats the biggest bunch of bullshit EVER. lol so we argue and then she says "u know i hope they drain your knee today at the doctor and u know what else julia? it hurts like hell and im not going to hold your hand! your going to sit there and be an adult" now...i have this major fear of needles. i cant control my body when i know im gonna get poked with a needle. My blood literally runs cold and i start to shake and then here comes the tears...not like sobbing, but like just tears rolling down my cheek. Ive tried many times to control it...cuz shots dont actually hurt, even i know that. But my mom didnt have to say that...they were gonna stick a HUGE ASS needle under my knee and suck out all the juice...and she even knew it hurt like shit and she still said "well im not gonna hold ur hand!" how childish...so she picks me up from school..with a chocolate milkshake...lmao we're in the office and i can tell she feels bad when she hears the dr. talkin about draining my knee outside in the hall, and i look at her, stick out my tounge and say "im not gonna hold ur hand!"...she looked kinda embrassed and gulity...good she needed to feel bad! lol  So..we're in the dr's office...and he comes in says "ive looked at ur MRIs and well...it's not so good." YAY what everyone loves to hear!!! heres what he says:"You have some pretty serious injuries, 3 to be exact. You have torn your ACL, you have compacted bones, and blood has filled your knee joint. Now, the compacted bones is where your bones (the 2 that make up ur knee) smack together causing them to bruise deeply. (he said i was lucky i just didnt break the joint) and the other injury is where the joint has filled up with blood." Now...buddy oh boy...what do u do to fix it? SURGRY!! what fun. the chick who is TERRIFIED of needles has to have an IV! and yes...the IV is the part im worried about, not the cutting or stitching or anything like that...dammit...but there is a good side to this story  I GET TO CHOSE WHEN I WANT MY SURGRY CUZ MY KNEE CANT GET ANY WORSE!!! haha that means after my hondorus trip! lol yay... oh but no more soccer....and i gotta have a special ACL brace fitted to my knee for when i play tennis...  Today at school we had this drunk driving assembly about 2 kids that died and 1 that barely survied. I cried my eyes out...i knew the kids, i had helped someone babysit them...it just tore my heart out. I dont think ive ever cried like that in school...the thing that made me even want to cry more was when i looked at Chris C. afterwards and his eyes were red and all watery...and i said (kinda joking...but i meant it seriously) "be careful after prom okie dokie" cuz we had just gotten done talkin about how much he was going to drink...and he looked at me and said "dont worry, im leaving my keys at home and ill be careful, i promise" and i was standing in front of him and he hugged me...just a nice snug lil hug...it almost made me cry...
