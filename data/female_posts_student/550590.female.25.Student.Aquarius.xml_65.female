Of course, it was delivered at 6:30, so I SHOULD have been home, but alas the Power Point for the National Youth Court Center Presentation is due on Monday and I'm still kind of treading water hoping that someone else will magically agree to write it for me (Shawn?  Avi? I would say Thomas, but we all know the boy can't spell.)  Had my 6 month review today...Jeez, can you believe I've been doing this job for 6 months?  To this day I've made less than Thomas has made since January.  But I'm not bitter...much.   Still no luck posting links because I still lack the motivation to learn HTML.  Had an IM today for the first time since, oh, mid January from our good buddy Voldemort.  Today was a mildly productive day at work, but I still want to hide my head in the sand, stay at home and be a student skipping class again.  For those of you still in school, don't ever go out into the real world.  It's a horrible, horrible place.  At least in school you're miserable but you can be drunk and miserable.  Being drunk at work will only get you fired.  Then you're drunk and miserable and poor.  Okay, I'm gonna go try to be productive now.  But feel free to AIM me and tell me that my blogger journal is SO cool and that you miss me lots.  Write me poetry.  That would REALLY impress and cheer me up.  But don't make it rhyme.  Then you'll be a loser poet.  And nobody likes a loser.
