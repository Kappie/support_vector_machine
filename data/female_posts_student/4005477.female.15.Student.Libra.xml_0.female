After she finished, I came back home and blogged about how those appointments went. I was within an inch of posting that particular entry. And then my computer froze. God, was I annoyed. But yes, I did try to post yesterday. However, my computer malfunctioned (the idiot machine) before it registered, so I didn't succeed in my mission. I'm too aggravated to bother with restating the entire experience I talked about yesterday, so unfortunately you won't hear about what happened with Mom's new Indian clients. It's not that big a deal anyway. Just another example of the dangers of relations with Indians.  Today is Sunday, so of course I went to church. That went pretty well. Hmmmmmm...There's nothing special to say about it actually. Well, nothing that I haven't said already. What's the point in dwelling on things you can't overpower, right?  After church, we (Mom and I) went to Waltham, Massachusetts. My church is in Burlington, and Waltham is about twenty minutes from there, so we stopped by the condominium we own in Waltham. Mom had an appointment with this Indian guy named Sanjiv. She was supposed to show him the condo, to see if he wants to buy or rent it.  Before I continue, here's some background info about Sanjiv: Sanjiv, my friend, is a guy with truly low self esteem.  The first thing he says to a complete stranger (my mom, in this case) is, "Madam I work in Hospital. I am not doctor or anything. I am secretary. Please give condo to me. It is good for me. I am good man, even if I no have status. Okay Madam?  ji-hah  Madam. Thank you Madam."  And then he proceeded to call my mother all day yesterday to make sure she hadn't changed her mind about meeting him, "because of [his] status." So confident of him.  Here's my poor mother's opinion of him: "I think he's gay, Lavima (my nickname). He talks in a feminine manner. [Just like Sai Baba]"  He's also very bossy. He started yelling at Mom because he wanted to know if she was going to park in the street or in the condo complex parking lot. Seemed quite impatient. Although, that was possibly because Mom made him wait in his car for fifteen minutes while she went shopping. Yeah, that might have done it. Either way, she yelled back (he was across the street from us) saying she would turn our car around and park in the complex. She told him to follow her. So naturally he took the lead (another one with male dominance issues, no doubt), and ended up bringing the ten cars behind him to a dead stop for five minutes, while he figured out which way he should go. In order to stop the impending riot, Mom honked at him to get his attention, and received, along with his, the unwanted attention of most of the peeved pedestrians' and angered drivers'. Mostly to avoid the looks of bloody murder directed at Sanjiv, she brought him to the condo in two minutes. I love my mother.  After all of that, he saw the property and said that he'd talk with his uncle and get back to her with an offer, or something of the sort. Good luck dealing with him, mother dear.  And that was my Sunday. Extremely exciting, don't ya think? I can barely contain myself, just thinking about it. I can't wait to have another two years' worth of Sundays just like it. Yay for me.   Antes de  I forget, I should mention that my best friend is Poire, whom I met in sixth grade. She has her own blog, which you can visit at  urlLink http://geeky-girl.blogspot.com . I started my blog at her recommendation.  Speaking of Poire's blog, I think I'll go and make some comments on her posts. That should entertain me for awhile, since I can't call her. She's in Massachusetts with her grandparents, probably spending lots of quality time with her strictly Catholic grandmother. Lucky her. Anyway, until next time everyone.  Au revoir!
