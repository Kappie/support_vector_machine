Anyway, so today was the first day of public school and I have to say it was the strangest group of people I've ever seen in my life. I mean that in a good way, diversity is key. I think.  Well, I totally botched first period because no one told me we had to pick up our locker numbers in another classroom.  I didn't even get to use my locker by the way, ok maybe I got to walk by and say hi, but that's about it.  I walked into the wrong classroom a couple of times, and that was kind of embarassing.  I had a group to sit with at lunch though (the cheerleaders..ooo... yeah whatever), and despite how stressed out I was I actually managed to make friends.  I didn't meet anyone cool until I had my smart classes.  I'll tell you, that's where its at, yo. So, all in all, it wasn't horrible. My assignment for english is to write a poem, a non-rhyming poem. (i think reason that quote above has been running through my head) I'm probably spending way too much time and putting way too much effort into this simple "getting-to-know-you" excercise, but I just can't get past it. I don't know what to finish with...     Nicole, Very observant, quick to laugh, quirky habits, Sibling of no one, Lover of music, movies, and mozzarella, Who feels the need to always improve, Who needs only a nice place to sleep and some neopolitan ice cream, Who knows not what Iâ€™m doing in this poem, Who fears large crowds and furry spiders, Who would like to see... the world inundated in molten candle wax? 	Neubarth   ok, so it's retarded at best, but its a work in progress!!! ok?!? Insight much appreciated, thank you.  Love, nikore
