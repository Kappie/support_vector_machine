After a while, I started to ask. Where are my friends? Why were they not with me? Why am I alone? I started to cry, I couldn’t handle it anymore Hot tears rolled down my cheeks I decided I would stop loving, Stop caring for people who didn’t care about me Who was never behind me nor ever will I started to give up, I started to lose hope I got a knife from my pocket When I heard footsteps following me Once again, I turned around But there was no one behind me I looked at the knife then to my hand When I felt a soft tap on my shoulder I looked beside me and there you were That’s when I realized, you didn’t abandon me You were walking beside me all along It was only me, who didn’t see Because I refused to look beside. But I was right, you know, You were never behind me nor will you ever be Because you were and will always be beside me Just like I will always be beside you.
