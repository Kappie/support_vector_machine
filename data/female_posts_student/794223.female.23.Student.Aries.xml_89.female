We moved my grandmother from the Summit in Austin to here in East Bernard on Tuesday, after spending 4 days straight unloading moving boxes.  So in addition to getting our new house together, Opa and I need to take care of Mimi--who can't walk.  Fortunately, Opa purchased a lifting machine to help, and we have an at-home registered nurse to come in every day for a few hours.    Also, we are blessed to have the rest of our immediate family like 2 minutes away from us~ my Aunt Rite, and two cousins Jamie and Brandi.  My cousins are like the sisters I never had, but despite the fact that we basically grew up together, we haven't seen much of eachother since we've become adults.  It is so nice and refreshing to have them drop by after work and check in on us, to have them in our lives again.  It's going to be so much easier on Mimi when I move to New Orleans for Grad School in August, because she'll have her other 2 granddaughters here to spend time with her.  But...we are all exhausted.  Almost past going, from the effort of moving in and taking care of someone full time who can't take care of herself.  I almost have to take a hot bath nightly in order to wind down.  Everyone who's reading this...my cousin Brandi needs your prayers once again.  The crappy insurance company she had while she was working in Bryan/CS has denied all coverage for her brain tumor treatment at MD Anderson, which amounts to quite a hefty penny.  I hoping that we'll be able to help out after we've closed on the house in Austin, but nevertheless this is the last thing Brandi needs right now.  Her mother (my Aunt) is having problems with her job, has worked her butt off helping us move in and get Mimi situated, and has had to worry non-stop about her daughter Brandi for close to 6 months now.  I think we all have a little too much on our plate right now, and we constantly need to be reminded that the Lord will provide.  I pray that things calm down soon; if not, another one of our family members is going to have a heart attack.
