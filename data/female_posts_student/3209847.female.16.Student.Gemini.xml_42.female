I've been having a good two weeks. Sarah and I are still very much in love and very happy. I'm sure you needed to know that...  May 8 was prom! How fun was that!?!?!? I hope everyone had fun! Everyone looked amazing!!!! Jarrett, Lolley, Courtney, Morgan, Ashley, Taylor. Everybody looked great!! It was really really fun. And so was Survivor Island! I kinda got a little whiplash but that's alright! Survivor Island was definitely a hit though. That's for sure. =). Good Job Bonnie!! You did a fabulous job!!   Monday, May 10 was Betty Buckley Awards. Although we didn't win anything, it was still a very incredible experience.   Then we had a choir concert on May 11. It was very sad! I mean really. Mr. Ice told the choir that he was "officially" retiring. We all started crying. I definitely did.  Senior dinner was really great as well. It was wednesday May 12. The senior video was cute. Sarah had awesome pictures! There was this one of her when she was like 10 months old looking at the camera. She looked so adorable!!! I'm sorry, i'll stop with that now.   Mark and Jeff had their spring show on Friday, May 14. It was also an auction, my dad spent a lot of money, hahaha. They did really good! I was so very proud of them. Sarah came with me. I know she really didn't WANT to or HAVE to for that matter, but she went anyway. She's such a sweetheart.   Graduation was Saturday, May 15. So sad!!!!! Sarah did such an amazing job on her speech. I was so proud of her. Congratulations class of 2004. They're graduated. Haha. I'm sure everyone is very happy. We then ate at Pappadeaux. I stuffed myself!! Oh wow. But anyway..  Sunday, May 16. I got to spend the day with Sarah. It was a lot of fun. We ate at La Madeleine. Now back to school... How fun! Only one more week until finals! pretty awesome! Alright well i'll Post some more later! =D!!!
