(AP span baby!)  tonight's was the saddest episode of the practice that i've seen. come back alaaaaaaaaan...!  this is very random. i'm going to birmingham, alabama in a few weeks on a "business trip." according to the town's website:    While we continue to grow more sophisticated, we also treasure many of the ways of the small-town South.... We talk about progress, but with a decidedly Southern accent.   okay...i dunno about you, but when ppl pointedly say that they "talk" about progress, it makes me think that they don't actually partake in it. anyway, i won't prejudge. i'll let y'all know.   if you're bored, you can play with  urlLink this . my personal faves are the  urlLink "heya grandma"  and  urlLink "gruntin and dumpin lil dumplin" . enjoy.
