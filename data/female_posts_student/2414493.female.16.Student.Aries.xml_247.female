You know, Enid, I'm not much for a bitch fight-esque argument, so I'll just leave it at this: I don't question your lifestyle, and I don't see any reason for you to question mine. But in any case, if you do, I'd greatly appreciate it if you didn't do it in front of my face. Pretend for a second that our bubbles don't intersect at all.  Go on, have a nice life. And don't tell me about it. And don't editorialize on mine.  Funny thing is, you don't have to read this. So I'll cordially invite you to stop reading.
