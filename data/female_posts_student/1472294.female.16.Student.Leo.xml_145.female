Initially, I went to my Grandpa'a house and was so bored that I went and watched SCV Cable and came upon AXN. And they were having a marathon that showed GALAXY ANGELS for a few hours long with about a few minutes of breaks. I watched from the afternoon till the night and IMMEDIATELY fell in love with their comedy, dirty jokes and sweetness. Although they were in Jap, luckily, the subtitles were in Eng... So end of my summarised story. I am getting quite good at it...     You are mint. You are clever and sensitive. Always thinking of others before yourself.    urlLink   What Galaxy Angel are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
