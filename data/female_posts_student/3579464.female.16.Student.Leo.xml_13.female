At any reate, I've decided to actually try this blog shit out, so here goes nothing. What's today? July 7th? I got back from ADP - Architecture Dsicovery Program - July 3rd. What a trip. It was crazy intesnse, more so than outsiders can get the gist of, but more fun than I've had in a long time. Staying up til 4 am cutting up pieces of balsa wood may sound tedious to y'all, but duh, it's Sami heaven. The two biggest things that happened get their own entires - one was arch boy, and one is Ty. I'll post that one next. But all these crazy little odd things happened, too. Like, I got drunk at a baseball game. So un-sami, right? but fuuuun! And, that time those two guys asked me to be in their movie, and handed me a script and their e-mail addresses. And that random fat guy in the Mo Bo G (missouri botanical gardens) that took pics of me int aht fountain. Odd. And Turle, the hot frat boy with the shaved chest, who invited us to his keg party. What fun, un-samish times. Guys, i am totally ready to break out. I can't believe you did all that clubbing shit without me. Oh, and Margaux, I have shower stories, too. Let me go write the Ty entry.
