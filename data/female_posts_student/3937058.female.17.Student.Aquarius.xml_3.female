Fingers crossed. I saw Amy's car 2day too...very cool, we sat on the curb for a while lookin at it and chatting and then satin it for quite a bit too, tho unfortunately (or luckily with amy lol...joking) couldn't go 4 a drive! lol...Lee is sooo random, he just asked me what the guitarist and the violinist was en francais lol (le guitariste (man) and la violoniste (woman) btw) Neways, I am still trying to organize a 'Prince and me' trip! Tricky tricky tricky heehee, coz every1 is busy @ different times!
