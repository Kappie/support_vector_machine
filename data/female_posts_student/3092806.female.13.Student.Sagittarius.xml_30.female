It's a beautiful thing to do. You don't have to be a certain age to do it either. You could be young or old and you still can daydream. It's not very hard either.  You think about things a lot... You make the things that have happened to you in real life way more dramatic then they really were to entertain yourself. You envision different worlds and how their cultures differ from ours. You think about impossible things to do and create crazy ways in which you can do them. You make up pretend fights, love scenes, and tragedies for your own life... You even create those for other peoples lives and/or other fictional character's lives... It's awesome...     I'm not exactly sure if that's how you classify daydreaming. It might be, it might not be... According to www.rhymezone.com , daydreaming, is absent-minded dreaming while awake. But what is dreaming exactly? According to this website again, dreaming, at least the type I'm writing about, is imaginative thoughts indulged in while awake... Hm... Interesting, very interesting... Yet, what is considered imaginative? So, I asked RhymeZone yet again. They responded that imaginative is    marked by independence and creativity in thought or action. This was a very intriguing search to undergo. So, daydreaming is absent-minded independence and creativity in thought or action indulged in while awake. I was sort of close, right?     Anyways, however you define daydreaming, isn't it wonderful? Other people call it a complete waste of time, but to me it's WAY more than that... Ah, this subject is so stupid and lame, but do you know what? I seriously don't care...
