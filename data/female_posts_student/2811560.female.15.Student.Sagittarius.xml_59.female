It was just bad and long and not fun. Today was ok, I guess...except for gym which always sucks. I'm getting to talk to Paul more, which is making me very happy, gives me something to look forward to every day. So then we had our band concert tonight, man was that intense. It was Snoeck's last concert, so everyone was really sad and crying and stuff. It took a lot for me not to cry. Plus, I knew that Kasper and Pyde would make fun of me if I did, so whatever. Ok, totally off subject, but yeah. Matt Wronski is going to wish he was never born. Lol, he told Paul that I liked Noah! Which is totally and completely untrue. It just amazes me how people can take acting and turn it into so much more. Whatever, I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. I think thats it for now...
