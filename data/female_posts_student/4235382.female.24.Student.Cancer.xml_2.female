It is equally lovely that those of you who apparently have inspiration and time to write oozing from your pores (you know who you are) are sharing your poetry with the masses. Jesse thinks I am dead because I have not yet posted, so, here is proof of my life blood. I am not a dead poet. However, I am feeling much like one since my arrival in warm sunny California, where I rushed directly to the Golden Gate University bookstore in San Francisco and purchsed $300 worth of text books. Mind you, they were out of at least two of the books that I need. Since these lovely (and not so inexpensive) purchases, I have succombed to long days of reading the law. Really, it is so far from reading Barbara Guest or Alice Notley that I feel as if I am studying Chinese or Algebra. My correspondence has taken a back burner, my writing is non-existent, and yet, as Jesse not only fears for my poetic life, but gives me grief as a good Jewish mother should, I am writing this post, to tell you all that while I may not be present often, I am here, I am paying attention, and I am not (yet) a dead poet. Does this thing really lack spell check? G-d help me.
