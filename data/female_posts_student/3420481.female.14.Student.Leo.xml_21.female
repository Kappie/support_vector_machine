I might have got two wrong. I really don't know. After our test we got to do what we wanted as long as it was quiet. I finished my social studies and then read my book. In second hour cooking we made cookies except Mrs. L had major PMS. She kept insulting our kitchen which was doing pretty good compared to the preps' kitchen. They had a marker in their oven. I don't even know if I'm going to go to that class tomorrow or if I'm just going to sit in Mrs. V's office the whole time. Third hour was fun. We got to make 3-D triangle things. I colored mine and gave it to Mrs. Engels. It was a joy. Mrs. Benzschawel taught us fourth hour. She is a really good teacher. At lunch the phenomenon happened. TRENT ASKED ME BACK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally said yes! I was so excited. All I could say the rest of the day was OMG OMG OMG OMG! During chorus we went through our concert and decided that we would have a pizza party on Friday since our last concert will be Thursday. During study hall I scanned pictures for Mrs. Engels again. It is so much fun. Then during English we started watching the third Anne Frank movie. It really is a good movie. I love it. It's just so sad. Eighth hour social studies we corrected our assignments and then got another one. I got it done in class. After our track party, which was pretty boring, my grandpa picked me up on the cycle. It was a short ride.. but a fun one. When I got home we went to the library to get our holds and then to Wal-Mart so we could break a twenty so I could have the $7.50 I need for school. I got a magazine and Mitch got some food. Now I am typing this. I think I'm going to leave though so I can go watch this awesome movie called D-3. The third mighty ducks movie. I like these movies even though they are hockey movies. Now I'm leaving you with this to think about - If a girl got a sex change would she still get her period?
