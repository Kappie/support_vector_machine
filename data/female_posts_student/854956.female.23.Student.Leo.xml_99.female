I started classes on 9 June (Monday) and I realized I was going to have a crappy first session.  :'(  I had a Child Growth and Development (Early Childhood) class at 8am, and a Cognitive and Language Development class (also Early Childhood) that was at 11.  Well, UTSA made a booboo for the first class.  They gave it the times that a 5-week class would have, and it's a 4-week class.  So, we were going to be short by hours in the end.  The professor's remedy was to switch the class to 7:30am.  Oh what fun.  Well, I mean, I knew that we would have "group papers" due every Monday (4 of them, 3 pages, single spaced...)  and on Monday he had told us that the tests we'd have every Monday would be 20 questions.  Well, someone asked again on Tuesday about that, and he let us know that those tests would be 20 questions per chapter.  We were supposed to read 4 chapters each week.  I dropped the class on Tuesday when I got home from class.  Reason being, my other early childhood class has all these observation things we have to do, PLUS projects and tests.  And, I knew that it'd, content-wise, be easier in a 4 week period.  So, I kept it and dropped the other.  I'm pissed though, because the professor for the Growth and Development class should've told us what he told us Tuesday on MONDAY... then at least people could've gotten a 100% refund for the class.  Oh well... With the 9 hours I was going to take, it brought me one credit short of being a Senior... so, it's not like it was the difference between being a senior or junior.  I need to go to the offices for Interdisciplinary Studies and Music this week sometime... I have to redeclare my major and set up a time with my advisor, and I need to declare my minor in music so I can sign up for classes.    Whew... so that's school stuff.  Well, not all of it, I have a Children's Literature course next session.  I'm excited about it, though.  :-)  Okay, so... in other news... our remodeling stuff is about 50% done (in the living room).  The Dining room is done... and the living room will probably get done this week... by next weekend...?  Yeah... it will be.  I haven't talked to Zack that much lately... I've been busy... he's been busy.  He's like what I want in a husband... but I doubt he WILL be my husband.  He's too far away... and I don't foresee him moving, because he's too close to his family.  It's fine with me... my prince is out there somewhere.  Maybe I'll follow in Alexis's shoes and find someone here close to me... but I'm not all that ready for a serious relationship right now.  Next semester is going to be crazy for me... it's probably better that I don't have to worry about a boyfriend.  Oh... speaking of boyfriends... or dating people, actually... yeah, Joe IMed me last night... and I will be getting my stuff back this week.  We actually had a decent conversation... there were no pointed or mean statements thrown at each other.  I don't know that I could ever be really good friends with him... but at least I know I can be civil with him... and at least deem him as an acquaintance.    Oh... only one other thing to tell about.  Seeing that the Atkins diet works gave me motivation to give it a whirl.  I started on Monday... and I've lost 8 pounds... and an inch off my waist, hips, thighs, and upper arms.  And that's an inch on each section.  So, I guess it does work.  I wanted to lose some pounds before my brother's wedding.  So far, so good.  Oh yeah, and I got a call back from the childcare place I put an application in at.  I'm supposed to have an interview this Thursday.  I'm thinking it'll mostly be to iron out details.  I'm probably over-qualified for the job.  But I have to make sure I get to work with school-aged kiddos, and that I get paid at least $6/hr.  :-)  Yeah, I'm demanding... but I have all my CPR/First Aid certifications up to date, and I have experience in childcare.  Anyhow... I must go now, because I have a project to get done for my class tomorrow along with studying for the test.  :-)  I'll try and post as often as I can.  Adios til then...!!!
