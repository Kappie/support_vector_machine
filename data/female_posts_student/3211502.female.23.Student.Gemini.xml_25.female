When I first started out this anti-french fries trend, there were a ton of other foods that I had waged war upon. These foods included: muffins, donuts, brownies, cookies, bagels, etc. Basically, I promised myself that I wouldn't eat anything that tasted deliciously good and was horribly bad for you. Pretty much, I ended up caving and resumed consumption of these foods (except for donuts, thank you). However, I've been faithful to the anti-french fries movement.  However, Wendy's decided to fuck with me today. Usually, I'm very good about ordering any food in a french-fries friendly environment. I avoid consuming anything that might come with french fries. So, today, I ordered the Ultimate Chicken Grill sandwich. The lady at the register asked me if I wanted the combo. And, I told her no. I just wanted the sandwich. But, apparently, it didn't register (Oh, I made a funny!). When I got back to the apartment and peered inside my Wendy's bags, I noticed FRENCH FRIES sitting right next to my sandwich. The horror!  So, I promptly threw away the french fries and fought off any urges that I had to consume them. Surprisingly though, I didn't really feel really any urges. I just stared at the french fries as was like "Oh." Good to know. You really can fight off your cravings. Maybe I'll re-think the South Beach Diet again.
