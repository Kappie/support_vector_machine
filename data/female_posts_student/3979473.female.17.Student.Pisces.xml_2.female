I mean, the moment i feel like i get really close to a guy, then it all seems to go to crap! what the heck??? You know what? that does it. I'm never going to let myself get close to a guy. What's the friggin point? The minute you start to want to share urself with them its like they switch on the reverse mode and back up to stage one and you start to feel like you've never known them. Or even worse, when ya start to feel like your pushin ur dream guy away. It's so stupid. You know i sit here after talkin to one, and its like.......... ah gosh i don't even wanna get into it its so stupid. Guys out there readin this, i swear its nothing against you, i'm just having a mad moment where i hate all men atm. But i'm sure there are some of you out there that are just lovely. I mean for gosh sakes, the guy makes me cry, why the heck do i like him??? i feel like slapping myself for being so stupid into thinking that i had any chance. ARGH for freak sake! I HATE HIM! Get real girl! He'll never like you and that's the end of that! .......... (sigh) ok i feel a bit better now.... i suppose the 2 hour sob helped as well. Ok i don't hate him he just....... frusterates me right now. I don't like him... i don't. It was just a phase and now i'm done with it. Yep. Ok i'm cool. Wow that was theraputic.
