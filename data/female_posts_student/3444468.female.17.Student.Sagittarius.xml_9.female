Suddenly Gerald and Edwin yell out "No test! Test is cancelled!" And I am literally bouncing up and down! I was so excited. I was so nervous for the test too. So now that I got an extra day to study for accounting? What do I have to show for it? Nothing.  It's 8:44 now and I haven't started studying. I'm such a loser. Eh, whaddya gonna do?
