A noose is nothing...ever been tortured to death? And then brought back to do it again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again...i lost count in the end. Knowing that you can't resist the urge to scream like a girl for much longer is humiliating...not a quick drop, probable snap of the neck before a relatively quick asphyxiation. Oh, and here's one for Reeses...well, half of her...crucifixtion. I'm irked.  That all? Where do you get the energy?  No, not the great god  of  Oz...just "The Great God Oz." Ask Daniel some time...or Jacob 'n' Selmak.  Yeah, well, it remains to be seen whether or not they like it as much as T. FOr all we know he could be a Jaffa Geek.  Yup, and if you get the Doc P.O'd then she brings out the  really  big needles.  Yeah...I'm not so sure that applies when the 'alien resides within you' as opposed to 'with you in your land'. If it did, all those creepy bugs you can get in the tropics, or Africa wouldn't make you so damned ill. And there's this one little fish that, when you're peeing...well, i think you get the point.
