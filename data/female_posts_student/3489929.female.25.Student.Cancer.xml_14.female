Me: "What the hell else was I going to do with it? It's not like I have any use for it, other than painting a face on it and using it as a finger puppet."  I have circumvented the IRS (take that, bureaucratic assholes). I called the Dubya and asked the financial aid office if they knew of a way to get a copy of my tax return. She said she could mail me a form to request one. Score!!!  V.v. good day today, after a sad start. Blondie (co-worker SH, and yes, Lisa, to answer your question, it was she that I had "subterfuged" yesterday) came in this morning bawling because a friend of her family died in a car accident last night. And her cousin died two weeks ago. And to top it off, as if her morning wasn't already shit, she hit and killed a kitten on the way to work. :(  Jefe noticed, was a little irritated that she was a mess, and told Posh to send her home. She left sobbing these little staccato bullet-like sobs that made me feel so bad for her. But is it also really, really bad of me to be glad they sent her home? I mean, I could not have gotten anything done today if I was worrying about her being able to hold it together on the phone. Right?   Then Posh told me that Jefe had a surprise for me. He got me one of those full-length massasing pads that goes in your chair and has three different speeds and HEAT (oooohhhh) massage. Homina. Love the folks at Homedics. Found out that you cannot turn it on high while on the phone because my voice sounded like it does when someone is beating you on the back while you're talking. Very cool for a party trick, not so cool when trying to open an account over the phone.  Other downside- it made me start bleeding again. I swear, if I jar my pelvis just a little bit, it's like free rein to bleed like a muthafucka. But you know what? I'll bleed a river if the cause makes me feel SO DAMN GOOD.  The others are jealous. And pissed. And I don't care. My boss loves me right now. He told me my attitude is great, my calls are fabulous, and my performance is the best it has been in months. He gave me the greatest compliment of all, though, when he said he has stopped focusing his energy on me and is going to leave me alone to do my thing.  Hallelujah, Mr. Gooooooden!!!!!!!!!!  I love it when he lets me "do my thing." That means two to three months of freedom and MONEY. He pays me well when he leaves me alone.   Of course, I'm set to screw him- and not in a fun way- in two months, so my victory is tinged with bittersweetness...  But I'm here now. And I'll milk it for all I'm worth.
