This looked interesting or at least self-absorbing.  Things to know about me. I am a mechanical engineering student, that is a single mother and a recovering herion addict. So much of my life is referenced to these things. I am not very technology literate and am not sure if this will even become something or if that then, become something of interest.  Lately I feel I am missing something. That I have lost a deepth or an excitement in my life.  I will not begin a quest to get it back. Though I don't now what or how, I will find it.
