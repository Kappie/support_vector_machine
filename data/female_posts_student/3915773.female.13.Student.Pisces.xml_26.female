This summer FOX pushed for attention to the fact that they would be hosting a brand new summer line up. However studies show that the number of people watching the reruns of T.V. crime dramas is far exceeding that of the new shows. Meaning “C.S.I.,” “C.S.I. Miami,” and “Cold Case,” all of which are on CBS are taking the top spot of television shows. Next is NBC, which also hosts some crime dramas along with reality shows. ABC’s comedies usually take over during the summer season, but even those have tapered off. Meanwhile FOX, is struggling in the number four position. Two of their summer shows, “The Jury” and “The Casino” have already been canceled; this is not a good sign for their other shows that are barely surviving the season.  The reason that the reruns are at the top is because they are great shows. Also I believe audiences like the opportunity to solve a mystery for a second time or a first if they missed an episode during the regular season. Besides, many people during the summer travel. So there isn’t going to be that many people sitting at home every night watching T.V. as is during the fall season. However I find it peculiar that this article didn’t mention the FOX program “The North Shore.” According to many people I have talked to, it is the best new show of the summer. I would have figured that if “The North Shore” had been a flop too that this article would have mentioned it. So this leads me to believe that FOX does have a hit show, but the paper neglected to mention that because this article is based on the idea of showing that reruns outperform new shows. Even though I do feel FOX wasn’t given as much credit as they could have been, I think that next summer FOX will rethink the idea of announcing new shows to begin in the month of June.
