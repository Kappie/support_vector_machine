It was great to see my family again. i hadn't seen them in 3 years. We flew into wisconsin on thursday afternoon then checked into the hotel. then we walked around the University of Wisconsin campus to make my dad happy then had some dinner at famous Dave's. boy were those good ribs. Then on Friday my dad gave us a little tour of the campus before we left for minnesota. we got to minnesota at like 9 saw my aunt, uncle, and my cousins then went to bed at my grandma's house. Saturday was boring but sunday we went boating and i got to go water skiing. stood up first try it was so cool. then we spent 3 days in the wisonsin dells. we rented a house it was alot of fun. we went to the tommy bartlett show, then went on the wisconsin duck boats then went to water parks. we went to the largest waterpark in america called noah's ark that was alot of fun. then on thursday night we came home. it was upsetting to leave because i don't get to see them very often. hopefully it wont be 3 years again before i get to see them again.
