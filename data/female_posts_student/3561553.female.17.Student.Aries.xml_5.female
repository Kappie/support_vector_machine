Its like 1:26 and I'm supposed to be at school but since Mrs. Jacobson piled on all this h/w I stayed home today to sew my dress, I've been sewing since 8 with maybe a few 10-15 min breaks... Its so frustrating, although my dress is turning out pretty good... Maybe because my mom is helping me?  Ooo and I was supposed to get my yearbook today but since I was sick I wont get it till tomorrow, still exciting though except I look like shit in it and everyone is going to see my picture :| I shouldn't have worn my glasses ... But yeah maybe since they're handing the yearbook out before school is over this year I'll actually get more then 5 signatures... or maybe I just don't have enough friends? :|  Baseball... Baseball is going good, we've played 5 games and haven't lost one yet and I've only gotten out twice and walked once when she hit me (that means I've hit the ball like at least 10 times) so this year is looking up for our team...  WEEEEEEEEEE STANLEY CUP FINALS TONIGHT!! GO CALGARY, I can't wait! If Calgary doesn't win (which they will win) I will be sooo disappointed, but yeah I'm hoping to get to watch the game with Troy because its so much more fun watching it with someone else, but he doesn't know if he can do something yet... But yeah Gotta Love 'NHL' Hockey  anyways, I'm going to finish sewing my dress now because I'm supposed to go out with Kaila to hand resumes out right after school, so I need to get this done...
