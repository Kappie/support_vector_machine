So if you wanna comment.. I dunno. Do whatever. Do and irish jiG! As you can tell I'm in a happy mood. I dunno why, I just am. Weird, hey? Yes, I'm still infatuated with rusty.. 2 rusty's, actually. I guess I'll go into the second when I'm feeling brave enough. 'There is much pain'. If he/you're reading this, TALK TO ME!! I MISS YOU!! :( Anyways.. I'm not sure what else to write. Not interesting when I'm happy, eh? Oh yeah.. The new name and background are shittouse but oh well. Better than nothing.  Big brother is watching.  Steph.
