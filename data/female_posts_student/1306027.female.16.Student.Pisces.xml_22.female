All-in-All my summer ranked pretty well. The three weeks I spent in chicago definately helped though, like a mini-vaca, only with actual work involved. I made alot of new friends... Ellen, Ritu, Risha, Anu, Anna, Faye, Nicole, Joe, Margaret, Janna, Alaska (friend??....i dunno, he's weird.), Big rishie, and I also repatched some old friendships- Arturo, Sarah so on and so on. The expierence was great! But I don't think I could maintain my sanity having to school with all those kids again. I got alot of good ideas from them and vice-versa but you know... I like learning by myself. Some people think that's weird. I really don't care.  On to lighter and care free(er) things.  I'm redoing my room!   Yes, yes I know... it's been a long time coming. I don't think I could have lived with my "Sun and Moon" comforter much longer. No, Im taking a much more cooler stance on my room... seeing as my mom says it's the last decorating im allowed to do until I leave for college. (3 years). What are my plans? Well- Itz a black and tan motif. I got this really funked up bedding stuff with chinese symbols all over it. Next step- out with my curio cabinent. *Yes, I admit* I have a curio cabinent full of *cringe* Ty beanie babies from my younger years as an aggressive collector. Im selling that and my keyboard- mainly because I just can't stand the sight of either in my room any longer. What's coming in place? Well- being the avid Ayn Rand fan that I am- I have decided to set up a reading and writing space(clever, no?) It's gonna have one of those posh moon chairs and a night stand with a bamboo lamp. This part of my room will also showcase my art, a mosaic and an illumination. There would be several other art examples of mine only, my art teacher stole them...she did! *insert sounds of random mumblings*   Speaking of random mumblings...  I tend to be scaring people at work with my mumbling. Im told that I should not discuss my plans with myself. In my defence I utter- But that's part of the plan! And go back to my work, which would be doing things that people usually wont do on their shift at my workplace... like.. o i dunno... do their job. Don't get me wrong- there are some awesome people where I work.... but others... well, i wont go there.    Enough with the complaining!  I went shopping today!!!!  WOOHOO  If you know me than you know that I have several love's.... one of them being shopping. Here's a list of what i bought today.  1. Mini posters. I once knew sanity- but it managed to escape And Out of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most. 2. 2 pairs of jeans. It's that school type of season again. One dark and one sand blasted pair. 3. A new pair of boots!!! I LOVE EM.. they are so cute. 4. A cute shirt.  I should really go do some laundry.
