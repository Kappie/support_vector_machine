I auditioned for the student directed plays today. I thought that I royally sucked... I was stumbling over my words, mis-reading the lines, and just getting all flustered. ...But one of the directors told me at today's  Wings  rehearsal that I did good... So, I dunno... I'm sure I will get a part... But I'll know for sure on Monday...  Oh, oh! ...At lunch Eddy and one of the British chicks--there are two unrelated girls that I know of from Britian that go to Jefferson-- were going around with a pink lemonade flavored lollypop and having a bunch of people lick it...  I was number 23. :)
