I went up at 11:30 to put on my PJs and he was alright, he looked a little tired, but nothing I thought twice about. Then, I went back up to go to bed at 1 and he was dead. Belly up, under the blue thing that shoots out bubbles. Maybe he got trapped. I've had Otto for about 2 months now and I got really attached. He was the best frog ever, and I'm not just saying that because he was my frog. He used to swim into the bubbles from the air pump, get pushed away and keep doing that over and over again, like a whirl pool. He did flips and jumps a lot too. That's what I'll never forget. I cried last night for about 5 minutes straight. I mean, it doesn't take much for me to cry but over a frog? The size of a walnut. I realize though now, size doesn't matter, it's what's inside those counts. :) I'm such a loser! I want to get another frog, to keep Harry (my goldfish) company, you know? I think I'll wait a little bit before I do.   In other news, the newest Employee of the Month at the Hastings 4 is none other than yours truly, ME!! Guess what they gave me?! KERNEL KORN! He's all mine! I'm so excited! It's awesome! Also, I got basically 15 new CDs from Catherine. She got an MP3 and let me copy it onto my computer! I'm so excited.
