Thanks alot guys. But whatever. It hurts really bad, but I have to but that same happy masl on and play it off like I dont give a shit. Well guess what... I DO! I am so mad and upset all at the same time. And the really bad part is, I still have really strong feelings for him. How do I always get myself into these things? No more expectations and hopes for me. I'm not getting let down anymore!
