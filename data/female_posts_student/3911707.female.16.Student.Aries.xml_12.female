Heath called me while I was in the car with them... and when I hung up the guys wanted to know who it was. I wouldn't tell them, which pissed them both off. What gives them the right to ask me anyways? I'm not taken! I got my hair foiled and cut today. All I have to say is.... DAAAAAAAAMN. It looks hella good (which it better, for $90). Now I'm gonna have to get rid of the boy... I'm too damn good looking. Muwahaha. I'm full of myself...
