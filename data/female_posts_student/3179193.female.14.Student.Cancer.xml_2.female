I just hope it's not 'cos he's sick or hurt... :( I'm worried. I should call but he's probably busy so I won't bother him... Plus, I'm still waiting for that call he said he'd make to me this afternoon. Haha! Joking! I know he wouldn't call anyway. Blah... wow! I had a great time at guitar! Sure, I had some catching up to do since this class is faster, but wow; I learned a really cool song. Anyways... Gotta run. BubaizZ~!
