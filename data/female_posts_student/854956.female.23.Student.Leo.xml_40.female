I think the plan is to try to see  urlLink Drumline  tonight at the $1 theater.  Then tomorrow me, Wolf, and Ricky are heading into San Antonio, and tomorrow night at 8pm, Wolf and I are going to Blast!  :-)  I'm taking my camera... and maybe I can get some pics with the awesome drummers in the show!  WOOHOO!  Anyhow, we're heading BACK to Austin that night... because Wolf wants to be back in Austin for his birthday... and then I'm returning home Sunday.  My original plan was to stay til Monday, but I have to finish reading  Tartuffe  a play by Moliere.  So, I need to be here so I can get that done.  I still have about 4 Acts left.  :-)  If I'm in Austin, it won't get done.  I'm really happy I get to see my friends this weekend... I've missed them more than I realize.  Though, it's been hard to miss Ricky... what with the voicemails we leave each other... it's a comfort!  :-)  Although the Smeagol messages creeped me out a bit... but he only did it because he knew I'd laugh.  ;-)  My Mom thought they were hilarious... well, I  think  she did.  She walked away muttering something about me and Ricky being crazy.  hehehe  Well, we are... Crazy... Crazy like the Crazy Cat Lady!   Rooooowrrrr!  hehehe       urlLink  postCount('17Jan2003');
