Don't leave me hanging,  In a city so dead,  Held up so high,  I'm such a breakable thread.  You were all the things I thought I knew  and I thought we could be...  You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, suppose to be but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me just fade away  All this time you were pretending,  So much for my happy ending.  You've got your dumb friends,  I know what they say,  They tell you I'm difficult,  but so are they.  but they don't know me,  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me,  All the shit that you do.  It's nice to know that you were there,  Thanks for acting like you cared  and making me feel like I was the only one.  It's nice to know we had it all,  Thanks for watching as I fall  and letting me know we were done.  He was everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, suppose to be, but we lost it  all the memories, so close to me just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending
