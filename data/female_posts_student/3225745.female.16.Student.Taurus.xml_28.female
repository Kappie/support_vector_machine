So many things were stolen from other works either books or movies.  but i still loved it.  although, i think that some things dragged on and frodo never truely appreciated sam. i love sam.  hes the coolest.  And orlando bloom's character, like a jedi when fighting. oh and gandalf...kicks ass.  totally kicks ass.  ahh anyway i loved it and cant believe i went so long without seeing it.  going to go running, get some exercise since ive been sitting on my ass for over three hours.  check yall later
