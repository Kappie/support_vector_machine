'cause those who stay my friends for a long time are those that are 'real'.  they say what they mean for better or worse, they are willing to be there through the good and the bad.  those are the only people that i want around.  i have some really good friends right now, and to all them i say 'thank you'.  u make each day a little easier.  luv u all lots...
