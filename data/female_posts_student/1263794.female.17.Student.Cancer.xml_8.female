I hope I don't look old when I'm 50. Speaking of me being 50, I was talking to Miranda about how I can't at all visualize myself at that age. Heck I can't even see myself past 18. But then I thought about when I was 7 and couldn't picture me past 10. Well the point is it scared me. What am I gonna be like? Am I going to have a husband? Kids? A good profession? I've really been thinking a lot about the future and it worries me. Sigh.
