When I woke up I did my usual morning things and then I checked  my email and dA account, which, contained a message from a "friend" of mine  completely bitching about one of my posted photos of another friend. I know that  critiquing is good... but I think that when I woke up so early in the morning to  read a comment whose main point was that my work was shit. Pure, shit. I would  look up the exact quote as it was quite witty- but I dont feel like it.     Anywho. So after I read that I felt like dousing myself with water and soap  so I got into the shower. This was a mistake as everytime I take a shower,  because I am not doing something that requires any extra thought dedication than  putting on shoes, I have all the time in the world to think about whatever I  choose to. This morning it was that comment and that person. And I realized  shortly that it had put me in a very nihlistic mindset and by the time I wrapped  the towel around my head I realized that everyone is exactly the same.     *well see what you want to see, you should see it all, well take what you  want from me, you deserve it all* (spontaneous Modest Mouse lyrics inbetween)      So after I realized that everyone is the same I began to wonder who exactly I  am. I am always troubled by this thought, because no one truely has the answer  to it. Normally I am comforted by the thought of a question that has no true  answer but this morning I was most certaintly not. Thats when I began thinking  'shit where is andy.. where is andy...' I know where he's at--- up in the  Cascades picking blueberries with his parentals but I needed him. :( So I talked  to Michael and Scott instead about it, and I realized that my art is NOT shit  and that it is something that I do to make myself happy and not to make other  people happy. Thank god for friends.     So after that I decided that I really should eat something since for the past  two weeks or so I hadnt eaten anything before four in the afternoon and that it  had begun to be a nasty habit. So I had eggs and then I went outside to shovel  apples that are falling in our orchard and then I washed the cars... My car had  become this ugly shade of brown when in fact its a sort of champagne color... So  I washed it and my mom's car and then returned inside.     Ahhh.. It's really hot outside. My yard is this long, flat, sandy yard and I  hate being in it. That must sound horrible. I hate being in my yard. But there  really is no shade whatsoever and such. We also keep bees so they're always  floating around... thank god they're not the kind to sting, but still.     Besides I got my new Rolling Stone.     Lindsey Lohan is on the cover which in itself is somewhat of a masterpiece.  I'm not gay or bisexual but I find her to be just this extremely hot girl. She's  got curves galore which I always found better than the stick model type, and  long red/brown hair, and large boobs like mine if I may say so. If I could have  any body I wanted I would choose hers. That way I wouldnt have to lose the size  of my boobs to match the frame. See, if you're a model (which i find nothing  wrong with being) you just have to have smallish boobs... mom's calling.. I'll  write more in a few...
