No more ghetto rigging my webjournal...of course, now I have to figure out how to include links and whatnot because I know you all would be crushed if I could no longer make fun of other people's websites in my journal.  Well, hmm...Lessee...not much new.  Still poor and bitching about it (I have 50 bucks in my bank account right now and I got my first loan statement this week--joy.)  The pups are back from Grandma's house: Frank is fatter than ever (it is possible) and Zoe is chewing more hair off her body every day.  Sigh.  I actually forgot they were here and left them alone for nearly 10 hours on Thursday.  (Doh!)  But they were good puppies and we had California Chicken Grill to celebrate.  Hmm...yeah, there's absolutely nothing exciting going on in my life.  Still trying to get the hell out of Florida, still poor, still bitter and angsty.  I cleaned out my closets and garbage-bagged a bunch of clothes I never wear to sell or take to Goodwill.  I guess that was kind of exciting.  Anyhoo, hope all is well with everyone out there in Cyberland. (Rent reference number 480 on my website.) Oh, I did get a new cell phone which means I need you all to re-email/AIM me your phone numbers because I no longer have any of them.  Eventually there will be new pictures on my website and I should be getting my guitar this week, so there could be exciting news forthcoming.  Until then "keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."  (If you know whom I am quoting, I am EXTREMELY impressed.  Ciao bellos y bellas.
