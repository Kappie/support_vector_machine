I liked this lab alot becauseour results came out pretty accurate and it was really cool. While we were doing the lab, two guys from the D took pictures and interviewed us. After lunch, i met with Dr. Baum and her husband. They further explained to me their project and why they are studying active galactic nuclei. I learned about the theory they are trying to prove, that all AGN galaxies are essentially the same, but appear different because of the different angles we are viewingthem from. After the meeting, i continued working on my list.
