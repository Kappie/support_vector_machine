IT IS THE BESTESTESTEST SHOW. i like it even better than 24. the banter the banter i love the banter. martin sheen is so lovable with his santa claus belly.   the new alicia keys album does not fall short of expectations.   vegas in two weeks!!!  i'm a pauper of words tonight. gonna go curl up with a good book to get a refill.  peace y'all.
