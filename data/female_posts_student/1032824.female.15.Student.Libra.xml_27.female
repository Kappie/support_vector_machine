Actually.. whether you're gonna make today fulfilling and fun.. or depressing and unproductive, it's all in one's state of mind.   Good luck to  Sir Faizal  for his posting tomorrow! oh yes, i have decided to go to the guide's campfire. initially i didn't feel like attending cos' i would be the only girl. however, i managed to get  nana ,  jo ,  ros  and  kasinah  to come along. now i wouldn't feel alone! =D  yipee!  and about tmrw's shooting competition, i'm feeling really psyched. i can't wait.  Girls just wanna have fun..
