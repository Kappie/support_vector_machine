I found a wonderful  urlLink apartment  and happily discovered that I like Lawrence very much.  Which removes one of my "things to worry about at night when I can't sleep."    I did make several interesting observations about the KS/OK drive and the states themselves; of course I expected some cultural shifts, like being asked if you'd like a "pop" when you really want a Dr. Pepper, or "coke."  But a few things really piqued my interest:  1.  Toll highways.  I know there is a tollway in Dallas, but I have never been on it.  I was unaware that toll roads are the Hotel California of the interstate highway system, with no exits and no gas stations for hundreds of miles.  I really thought I was going to be stranded in a wheat field somewhere between Oklahoma City and Kansas City, which is quite a stretch of nothing.  2.  The Kansas/McDonald's conspiracy.  On said toll roads, there *are* a few gas stations, with gasoline costing, of course, at least a dime more than it does at the gas stations you can see from the tollway but can't get to due to the lack of exits.  This is to be expected in a capitalist society, and didn't really bother me. I was so relieved to find gas I think I would have given a kidney to get a full tank.  What did bother me, though, was the complete lack of any competing fast food chains for about 350 miles of highway.  Only McDonalds.  Michael Moore would have a heydey in Kansas.  3.  One last toll-road observation:  there are no police.  I drove approximately 800 miles while in Kansas, and I still don't know what color their highway patrol cars are.  This is good for speeding, bad when you think you're about to run out of gas after dark.  4.  What are the inhabitants of Kansas called?  Kansans?  Kansites?  Kansonians?  5.  Based on my informal count, there is a disproportionate number of liquor stores for the population of Kansas.  This is okay in my book, but interesting nonetheless.    6.  Maybe I'm naive, but I didn't know that winters there were so bad you need covered parking to prevent the sleet from taking the paint off of your vehicle.  My excitement at being accepted to a law school (any law school) is rapidly decreasing at the prospect of winters being colder than they are in Waco.    7.  I was going to make a snarky comment about naming towns after foreign cities, like Ottowa, but then I remembered Paris, London, and Dublin, Texas and decided against it.  8.  There is an inordinate amount of signs on the roads warning against stopping in the median.  I wondered why this was such a problem, then I remembered observation number 5.  Probably a relationship there.  9.  Oklahoma.  This might be the worst part of living in Kansas.  I had never actually been to Oklahoma, but had always harbored a certain amount of distaste for the area since I am an eighth-generation Texan, and it's just bred into us.  I also, despite their poor selection procedures for law students, still love the Univeristy of Texas and therefore hate the Sooners.  But I always thought that the Okie stereotype was kind of like the Aggie stereotype--you know, once you meet a couple of Aggies you realize that some are idiots but others are very nice, intelligent people.    This does not apply to the Okie stereotype.  If any of my friends have Oklahoma roots, please do not destroy my opinion of you by telling me.  Oklahoma has a toll highway that is rougher than many unpaved roads I have been on.  Not only did I feel as though I was driving in a dry creek for 200+ miles, but I had to pay the state for this privilege.  On said highway, I happened to spot a policeman, and slowed my speed to 80 mph.  The Okie behind me, once we were safely past the patrolman, pulled up beside me and made an odd tomahawk-chop motion while scowling, which I assume is Okie sign language for, "Why did you prevent me from getting a ticket by flying past a state trooper at 90 mph, you bitch?"  I wracked my brain to remember the Okie sign language for, "Screw you, you ungrateful, inbred, obnoxious asshole," but had to settle for giving him a big Texan one-fingered wave.  I think the sentiment was adequately communicated.  Oklahoma's one redeeming value is that there is a Taco Bueno there.  But even fine Mexican fast food such as Bueno cannot restore this state to its once-average status in my mind.
