Boring, you ask?  NO!  Granted, if I felt like I was missing out on something, I would be upeset, but this isn't that bad at all.  So, if you are out at a club, or on a hot date, and you come home and get on this website to see what the losers are doing...we are online, writing for your sick pleasure, and enjoying ever mintue of it...
