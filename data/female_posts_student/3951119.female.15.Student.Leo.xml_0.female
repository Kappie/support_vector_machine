The song, the video...the singer. aa...anyway...One of my cousins was kidnapped. Lives in MN, name is Travis. aa...I think I should feel sad about that or something, but I don't know him. Never seen him, that I remember, save pictures. And never talked to him. It's kinda like watching the news and hearing about something like that happening on the other side of the world. It's like it's either not real...no...that's not it. It's like a story. But then, some of my stories can be more real to me than life sometimes. I get too involved in writing them. I have ideas for a seven books series right now. I just need to type up the character bios and the maps and the details and then get to work on the stories. I'm starting to spend way too much time thinking of characters. I want them to be real, to seem real, and so I spend so much time planning out every little detail of their lives. As if detail makes one real, and a life without detail is a life that doesn't exist. aa...Nothing from nowhere, I'm no one at all...
