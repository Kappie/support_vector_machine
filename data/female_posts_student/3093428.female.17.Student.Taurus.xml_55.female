I downloaded songs I wanted and deleted songs I don't need. I found out Andrew was moving away which was sad. Andrew is such a cool guy.   I wish you luck Andrew  I then went and got my haircut, had lunch with my grandma, and watched MXC!! I love that show. It was then off to work, which was ok. I only made $1 in tips! Whats up with that? I then got a call from Dyllan, and all the toughts I got out of my head have come back. Sounded like he was having so much fun! I want to be there! But what you gonna do...
