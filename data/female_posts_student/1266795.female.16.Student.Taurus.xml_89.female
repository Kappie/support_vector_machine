And, I might add, that this is written everywhere in Rome, so if you are ever in Italy, see if you can find it.  The next one is Ne supra crepidam judicaret. It's a hard one, so if you find it, 200 points. And another 100 if you can tell me the story behind it. (Yes, I already know!) Well... I'm glad to hear that Sarah is having fun!! And I hope that Olivia has a great time too! You know, computers cause me headaches. Many headaches. See, one of my friends is traveling and he sent me an email attachment, which my computer won't let me open. Evil electronic doorstop. Ah well. I wrote him telling him to resend it. Not much more has happened here. Yesterday was nice and peaceful. For some weird reason though, I had trouble sleeping and so I didn't fall asleep until 2 am. Ah well. I slept in until 11 though. That's what summer's for! :-D But yeah. Sorry this was such a short post. Ah well. Points now! Alison: 580 Michael:520 Olivia: 460 Evan:160 Jonah:160 Sarah:160 Nathan:50 "I never tire of being useful."
