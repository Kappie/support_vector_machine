Seeing how i am a bitter person i probably will hate all the annoying bitchy prepy people. The sluts. the guys who think they are all that, and go for the prepy bitchy people. What a society we live in?. Its far to complicated, and im sure one could not fully understand it. Oh The Last Kiss by A.F.I is playing on my playlist. Its beautiful. "And this is the art of love". Love who needs it? Well i guess we all need love. See i am bitter? but i love bailey and shannon, and thats all that matters. Im just sick of seeing people walking down the mall making out. its digusting. this one couple was groping eachother. who really needs to see that? Oh yes i work at the mall. And make fun of people. And then hats get stolen. Wow this pretty random. Dont worry random is good. And so are panties. yumm... Hannah  A little note * I feel very special being invited into this blog.
