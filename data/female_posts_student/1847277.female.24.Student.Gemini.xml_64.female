Good gracious, I hope not.  I mean, I suppose that was more meaning this phase in our lives, like, mid-20s, unmarried, relatively few responsibilities (i.e., no kids) etc.  But even then, I don't know.  I always thought that those people whose lives peaked in high school were lame.  But unless things start looking up, it appears that my life will have peaked in college, and is that any better?  Does life have to peak or can it plateau?  I dunno.  I think prelims are royally screwing with my perspective.  Perhaps in three weeks I will have a different view on things...
