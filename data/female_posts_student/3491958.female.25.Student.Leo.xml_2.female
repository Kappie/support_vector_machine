This sucks.  Its not all that fun and its not productive.  I need to start getting my act together.  Today I at least looked for a new job and printed off some possibilities to send my resume to.  While I did that I still didn't send the resumes themselves.  BUT, it stops here.    I work tonight so I'll try to catch up on my reading tonight.  Tomorrow I will get up early.  7:00 AM sounds good.  I'll update my resume and write up some cover letters then send them out.  I work at noon until 6:00PM so I'll leave it at that for the morning.  However, in the evening I should do some cleaning and laundry.  I can do my laundry while I clean the basement in general.  Need to throw out some garbage and stuff.  After the basement is acceptable, I'll try cleaning my room, then my office.  I think I'll leave the kitty litter until Saturday morning.    I'll be happier when things are neat and tidy.  I should make a list of things to get done for this coming week as well.  Anyway, gotta go to work...   -- Listening to... Alicia Keys -  If I Ain't Got You --
