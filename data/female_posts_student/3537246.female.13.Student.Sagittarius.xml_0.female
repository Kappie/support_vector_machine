Anyway, I've been keeping busy trying not to think about school in September because I get WAYY to excited and upset at the same time. Graduation was on Wednesday (June 23) and that was a really rough time for me and in September I start High School which is exciting, yet upsetting at the same time. But Oh well..   Anyway, today I shall receive a call from my good friend and cousin  urlLink ALISON  who rocks monkey socks! And I shall phone her one day when I have the money to LOL! SORRY ALLIE!! But I shall do it, one day! Today we're supposed to go downtown to the Hamilton Harbour at Pier 4 or something to see the Haida (Some historic ship that was in the war) .. but so far we haven't gone. We'll probably go around 2-3pm.   That's about all that's going on for now.... Hmm... I'll write another time when more goes on! I shall leave with this quote: CHEESE AND BANANAS DO NOT MIX!!
