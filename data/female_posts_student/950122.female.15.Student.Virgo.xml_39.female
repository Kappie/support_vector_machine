I helped teach some special children in a centre called "Nayon ng Kabataan". I ended up making drawings for a lot of kids. :) The best part of the trip tho was our bus ride to and fro. Our class rode in three buses, but only two teachers went with us, and our bus ended up being the one unsupervised. We'll be going back sometime next quarter, so I won't be seeing them for a while.  We're having half day on Monday; the high school and grade school teachers are going on a pilgrimage for enlightenment. Don't know whether I should be happy or sad.   Oh yeah, my birthday is this friday. Wonder what'll happen.
