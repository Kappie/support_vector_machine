It really sucks not knowing that Boston is in Massachutas....Ok just to make up for this silly, idiotic thing to do.....I am British or at least lived there for most of my life (and I didn't study America while doing so)...so leave me alone with you crazy American geographical questions.      Anyways, went into NYC today....God I love just being there...It either increases my dream...Or slightly breaks it down, depending on the mood I am in, but one day I will safely own an apartment there and an Art Gallery...So there...Just letting you know...For future reference.      But the city is a fun place...But I was thinking on the way back, it must be a real pain in the ass to go grocery shopping if you live like right in the midtown or uptown areas, bc its not like you have a krogers near by...Or a Target. Now the latter would be more important then the first but still...How do they get groceries? Shirley they can't all be crazy health, vegan, organic people and shop only at special stores. I really should get clued up on this before I make my home there.      Well I suppose that's all for the day..Unless later I think of something really quirky to say which will look very stupid in the morning..Or around 3pm...When I should wake up
