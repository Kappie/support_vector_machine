The one swimmer, Michael Phelps, should get like 10 gold medals, I mean he is really really good. Someone told me that is he beats some guys time that he will get another millon dollars added to his income lol(if that is what you call it lol) So that starts Friday then school starts on monday and it is back to the same ol' same ol' and this is my last year of highschool and i am upset about my scheduel cause it sucks like nothin else. Oh well what can I do...nothing that is what lol. Even though it does suck I am excited about seeing everyone and getting back into swimming so I can start to loose the weight I gained over the summer lol (can we say fat??) lol. Oh well, and I didnt even accomplish any of the goals I set for the summer but oh well lol. I say that way to much. So I dont know what else to say, 'cept laters!!! ~ashley~
