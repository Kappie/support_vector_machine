I have been smited down time and time again. My companions are bewildered they have all tried to protect me to the best of their abilities however the evil in this Castle is just too strong.   We have camped here for more than a week, every day that I rise I pray to Brell for safety however I don’t believe he hears my pleas. The guards of the castle are just too strong for any of our endeavors and we have yet to triumph. I fear that perhaps my companions and I are too weak to clear the evil of this place. We have succeeded in a number of these dark creatures yet there are more to dispel.   Kretais the sage of our group has decided that we must first level and gain more power by smiting lower evils first then return to this Dark Castle to clear this castle. Ziggur, my dear friend, has also ran to the Bazaar to buy me better armor. He fears that the evil ones everywhere might wish me harm.   Pray for us all,   Ackron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!
