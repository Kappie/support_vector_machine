But I don't want this blog to die either, so I think we should share the wealth. I'll start.  Today was a decent day. We had to march in band, whcih always sucks major ass. English was a waste of time. We talked about teachers we hated for about 30 minutes and then we spent the rest of our time working on some ghetto ass essay. And then Ed Adams (who I swear is insane) starting drawing all over my paper and poking me with his pencil. One of these days I'm just going to open a can of whoop ass on him and I'm sure Alice will have my back. He would probably kill both of us though, because he's a freaking monster. Government was boring. Brad picked on Josh as usual and Josh stood on his soap box and preached tolerance and understanding. Those two always keep the class interesting. Maggie, Val, and I have decided to change the grad night survey and to have sex as our number one choice of activity for the cruise. Karaoke was a close second. DOWNTOWN!
