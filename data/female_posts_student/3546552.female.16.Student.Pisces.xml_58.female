It all started with the  New Berlin Parade  where I got to watch my cousin ride his  miniature  motorcycle around with his patriotic shirt on. (did I mention that my cousin is  20 ?) yeah so his knees stuck out really far...LOL. Then I went to the church picnic where I got into a water fight with  Zach Brose  and many others who joined in. After getting absolutely soaked I went to the  Cameron 's for a taco dinner courtesy of  Leah , and to watch a movie with  Lindsey  and  Andrew.  Later, we all went to the  State Fair Fireworks  and had a great time playing games and eating puppy chow that  Lindsey  and I had made. I miss you  MR ! I wish you were coming back for cell group and worship team and youth group...ok, so I just wish you were coming back! Life is boring!!LOL, I'll find something to do with myself...maybe I'll  dream ...maybe not! Ha ha! Hope you and your family are having a good time,   HAPPY 4TH OF JULY  !   ~kendra
