I really didn't know what to expect. We left here at 5:50 almost on the dot and didn't arrive there until 8:30. I can hardly get somewhere when I actually  do  know where it is, let alone have to navigate as well (Catherine was doing a really good job though). Catherine and I had never yelled at eachother that much in our entire friendship as much as we did tonight. It was scary! I probably broke 100 laws just driving there. Luckily, the drive home was a bit easier, that only took us an hour and a half. I learned how to read road signs! I know this is a lot of pointless ramblings but I'm buzzing. Anyway, we got there and it's this campground with all these drunk people smoking, white trash...You know. We get out of the car and we were instantly cast members of The Simple Life 3. We looked  so  out of place.  I got the book The Perks Of Being A Wallflower today, I'm excited to read it! Now for a song...  Staying home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded hate it  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom Staying up all night just to write A love song for no one  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me  *Love Song For No One*-John Mayer
