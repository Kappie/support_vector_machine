(Oh dear, delerium before the downfall) Ah heck don't worry, the retail therapy on Saturday should do me good! Hehe. I just find it funny that some one can come up with a posh thing for shopping! God I love that person! It makes it sound intelligent (?) ... (Mad, totally mad) We're doomed! We're all doomed! (Er... go watch Dad's Army to understand) Oooh, interesting point. Izzy said that they banned Barbie's in Russia cause it turned all the girls blonde! YEAH! Go them! (If they actually did it... Izzy's a teenie bit less dense than me so it could be possible) Mmm ahh I have to go annoy *phone* ahh yes, phone, Laura now. *muhahhaaa* Hey Look Around You is on tonight! Go watch! BBC2 or channel 3 at 9:50! YEAY!
