Still I have not always had much luck forging lasting friendships - it’s a curse indeed.  Lately I have been thinking, wondering why we forge friendships at all?  It had occurred to me that friends –while being a gift from God- could often be a painful and trying bunch.  Something happened recently that tried the bonds of friendship and threatened to unravel our morals.  A matter of keeping a secret told by one, without allowing that secret to hurt another.  I realized that some friends are truly wolves in sheep’s clothing, lurking in the night doing their very best to steal the trust of a poor unwitting soul.   How can someone who has been your friend for so very long plot behind your back with another supposed friend to betray you?  Is a friendship not a bond that serves to protect and nurture and watch over one another through thick and thin?  Perhaps I have the wrong idea of friendship and that is why I have been so unsuccessful at forging them at times in the past.    Still morals aside, the true friend chosen by time and deed, it will all come out in the wash as my mom says.  Wise woman!   It occurred to me most recently that true friends –those who you know will not betray you; Matt, Emily, Jennifer  Chris, Terry  Kindra- are worth every second of having to deal with the others, those who are not true friends but rather torturous painful lurkers in friends clothing.  Those who are true friends are the reason that we forge friendships, because in the end it is those few souls you can call true friends who come through for you.  It is those few souls who give meaning to the word friendship!  ~Kristyn
