I'm going to need about 4 days to recouperate from this week.. oh wait.. i DO get 4 days, lucky me.  Hmmm... anything eventful happen today?  nope, nuthin.  OH WELL sorry to dissappoint, but there is studying to be done... although i'm not so sure it will get done, but it should.    OH GOODNIGHT FOR GOODNESS SAKES... WHY AM I TORTURING YOU LIKE THIS?
