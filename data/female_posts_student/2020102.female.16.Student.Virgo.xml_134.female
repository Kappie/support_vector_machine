I will find rest nowhere but in His holy will, a will that is unspeakably beyond my largest notions of what He is up to." -Elisabeth Elliot   "It is requisite for the relaxation of the mind that we make use, from time to time, of playful deeds and jokes." -Thomas Aquinas   "As no scripture is of private interpretation, so is there no feeling in a human heart which exists in that heart alone -- which is not, in some form or degree, in every human heart...." -George Macdonald   "Those who live in the Lord never see each other the last time."
