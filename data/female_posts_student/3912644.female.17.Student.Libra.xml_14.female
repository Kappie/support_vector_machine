Well this one boy strikes my fancy, and omg...he is soo nice and sooo much fun to hang out with...so wed. night we took a walk and walked around for like an hour almost just talkin, then thursday a group of us went on a night hike and he held my hand the whole time, then after that we hung out by the rec. place and looked at the stars and (insert some other small details)...all in all it was the most fun time i've ever had at a camp! so i'm thinkin o geez, i definitely kissed this boy and now he's never gonna call or wanna talk to me ever again...so i email him on friday night when i got home and checked it like 40,000 times during the day seeing if he responded....by sat. night i was starting to get discouraged when my cell rings and i pick up and it's him....he had just gotten a cell phone and called me, with no long distance plan (EXPENSIVE!) and he was definitely at his grandpa's house at some hog roast with like a bunch of his cousins and friends and he called ME! it was great...so we talked for a while and then i had to let him go, but i called him back and we talked for a little while longer and he's like well...i'll call you on Monday, is that ok? Hell yes it's ok! lol...so n e wayz, that's my meeting a boy story and maybe he'll come up to visit me sometime...too bad he lives in southern indiana right!!? sigh, boys.....  ;0)
