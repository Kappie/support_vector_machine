If it wasnt for this certain someone who helped me with my spanish compositions in the preterite and imperfect tenses, I would not be writing right now.  Thaaaaank Yooooou!  Phew.  It's done.  Ain't nothin' like having almost 2 weeks to write something and waiting until the last minute!  On another note, I've noticed that me and a few of my friends seem to be finding shit out about each others' lives through our blogs but we never really email or talk anymore.  Is this what has become of us?  We've just bypassed the conversation and go to what we want to hear, when we want to hear it?  Guess so...  Almost time for class!  I cant wait for school to just be OVER and I can graduate.  My goodness!!  By the way, Graduation Party at my house on June 5th!!! (ish)...that is, if the grass has grown in by then...
