He is a brilliant writer and thinker, in my opinion, even when I disagree with him, and he has been especially amazing in his pro-war writing since 9/11.  Here is his explanation of why Iraq, that it was not just some random choice made for political motives, but that it was the right choice based on the history of the region:   But this "Heart of Darkness" element is part of the case for regime-change to begin with. A few more years of Saddam Hussein, or perhaps the succession of his charming sons Uday and Qusay, and whole swathes of Iraq would have looked like Fallujah. The Baathists, by playing off tribe against tribe, Arab against Kurd and Sunni against Shiite, were preparing the conditions for a Hobbesian state of affairs. Their looting and beggaring of the state and the society--something about which we now possess even more painfully exact information--was having the same effect. A broken and maimed and traumatized Iraq was in our future no matter what.   Obviously, this prospect could never have been faced with equanimity. Iraq is a regional keystone state with vast resources and many common borders. Its implosion would have created a black hole, sucking in rival and neighboring powers, tempting them with opportunist interventions and encouraging them to find ethnic and confessional proxies. And who knows what the death-throes of the regime would have been like? We are entitled, on past experience, to guess. There could have been deliberate conflagrations started in the oilfields. There might have been suicidal lunges into adjacent countries. The place would certainly have become a playground for every kind of nihilist and fundamentalist. The intellectual and professional classes, already gravely attenuated, would have been liquidated entirely.   Go and read the whole thing.  He makes, as he as consistently done, a logical case not only for the war in general, but for the direction the war has taken.  And while you're at it, perhaps you should just peruse  urlLink the Opinion Journal  page every day, since I'm always recommending them.  I'll have to put a link to them over on the side.
