I've just stopped caring period being witty has just stopped being that important I explain myself out of guilt.... just don't touch me right now..   In Happier News   I'm only temporarily not broke. I'll be broke again ina  couple of days when after I pay some bills. I get ridiculously generous when I get paid. Just ask the people I bought drinks for last night.... I need to buy some books....something to read for pleasure any suggestions?
