In any case, this Blog, my new home in cyberspace, has arrived in due time. I have several posts, poems, commentary, and quotes from two earlier websites (Geocities '96-'02 and LiveJournal '02-'03) to transfer to this Blog over the next few weeks (hopefully). It will surely be a tedious process, but, I hope, well worth it for all of you. Be sure to stop by later and check it out! Ciao.
