I cant wait! but i talked with my aunt today and my other uncle is mad at my mom and my aunt so i probobly wont be able to see him. and i would like to cuz i never see my family but i guess i will find out what will happen when i get there!  oh yea and my flight reservations are someplace at my dads office and he didnt get them today when he went up there! so i dont even know what time my flight leaves!!!  my mom and i were joking and we were like dad probably thinks that aunt glo still lives in phoenix!!! so i will end up either in phoenix,jacksonville,or gainsville!
