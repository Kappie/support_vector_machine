In my case, I took it off because it is always my worst day. It starts on Sunday evening and it finishes on Monday afternoon. It only started back last August. Waking up to it, made me cry and want to stay in my bed all day. That is when I realize that I must have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or something like that. I endure this for 2 months, getting worst everyday, specially Mondays.  Until I called my family doctor and he told me that I did not have CFS or anything like that but that I was severely depressed. He has known me all my life, knows every little think that I have endured in my life. I could not accept it because I am a strong womem. I have a family to take care of. I have a important job. And depression only happended to weak and vulnerable people.   It has been a long recovery and I still have downs as you can see but medication and finding what you are about and who you are, helps a great deal.   Will talk again about this...   But for now, have a great evening and let's talk later....Be good
