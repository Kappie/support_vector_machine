I thought about it a lot today, and I almost started to cry.  But at the same time, I was thinking, "What the hell is wrong with me?  It's almost summer."  I don't think it's ever been like this for me before.  This time last year I was ready to kill myself to get out of school.  Oh, well.  Summer will come whether I feel torn or not. I had the health exam today.  What a fucking joke.  Didn't even think of looking over anything beforehand.  Doubt it would've made any kind of difference. I got into Advanced Women's!  I am very happy and excited about this.  Some of the people in there are my favorites, and I get to go to Hawaii if that works out.  So that should be a bunch of fun.  It is about damned time she posted that stupid thing.  Jesus Christ.  It should've been done three and a half weeks ago.  It was getting to the point where it became a game of seeing how annoying and unnecessary things can get.  At least it is done now. I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 this evening.  LOVED IT.  Seriously, the style, the dialogue, the music, the camera work, pretty much every aspect of how it was made--it is all BRILLIANT.  What a wonderful opening scene.  My favorite was the use of color versus black and white and how it kept switching.  The violence didn't even really bother me.  I definitely got used to it by the time she was slaughtering the Crazy 88.  Although I thought those Anime scenes were a little much.  Ughhh, the pedofile.  There were definitely times when I shouted "Oh, my GOD!" at the television.  But I laughed hysterically at some of those fountains of blood.  And woot for the 5.6.7.8.'s.  I might have to buy that soundtrack.  Now Hanna and I must see Volume 2.  I have seen a lot of good movies in the last couple of months.  It makes me wonder why I ever bother seeing the bad ones. Yay, talking about this puts me back into a good mood.  I forgot that I like to write blog entries.
