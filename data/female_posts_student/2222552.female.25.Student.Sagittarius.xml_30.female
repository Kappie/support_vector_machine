It took me a good 10 min of laying in bed before I could recall any of this it was so weird. Lately I have been forgetting things that I should know and it is so frustrating, I'm also very tired it seems I can never get enough sleep, I feel like something is wrong with me... I think I am going to go to the Dr. And see if this could be something more than just forgetfulness, and being tired, maybe it will be linked to the abnormal MRI results I had last summer.
