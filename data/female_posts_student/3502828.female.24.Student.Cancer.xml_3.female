The have to fly around and one should wonder how they do it but they manage to find exactly where you havent covered you ear.   It all started when I had to go out to pick up my laundry after they were crispy dry. My friends had warned me about insects wandering about in summer... What they dint tell me was that they would be as dangerous as houseflies.  Fat, big and bulky that I am I had to open the door a little extra to easily move out and in....thats when it happened.....I saw those two little villains zoom in through my door, while I stood helpless gaping at them. What was I supposed to do?? Admire the peacock blue colored wings...the slight curve of their bodies....or the way they just randomly kept flying about.  They made a sports ground of my pretty little room... The curtains served as mazes they could fly around in. My computer screen was a novelty to them. One of them enjoyed irrtating my fish through the glass tank...and then came the nightmare....  Not my icecream!!! Thats when I decided to have my revenge....Nobody sits on my icecream!My vanilla flavored icecream with chocolate and fresh whipped cream toppings is definitely forbidden area to any fly.  I quickly covered all my valuables in the room with wrapping sheet and put them into the shelves of my freezer with the swiftness and quietness of a professional Tai Chi practitioner and then took my revenge. My weapon was a humble towel.  I swirled the towel to create a whirl wind...that made them both fly back to the door. With swift motions of the three sliding doors I had them both trapped between two doors...with nowhere to fly except in between doors...  After letting myself out through the third door, I let the two houseflies fly away to live...hopefully happily ever after away from my icecream.   So you readers..who took the pain to read till the end...this is how you let two hoseflies out through three sliding doors.
