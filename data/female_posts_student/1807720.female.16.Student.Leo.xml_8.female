I absolutely love my new schedule for next year and I am so excited for chemistry and I don't even know why.  Maybe secretly I really like it and I just won't confess...lol!  My summer however wasn't all that and well it was pretty bad except for the odd days here and there but I suppose everything happens for a reason.  And well yesterday Chels and I went shopping and we both bought the same pants for school - like how totally cool and she got me this awesome ring for my birthday that matches the one she has!  I'm getting my hair done Thursay and nope I probably won't look like myself anymore but that's the whole point!  And well I had a little romance of my own over the summer but the book is still open so I won't say anymore until the chapter ends and the book is closed.
