(Alan, John, Toni and I) and sounding like morons for example Toni just said she wanted a "watery batch" and we all busted out laughing because no one has a clue as to what she meant.  And I really wanted to write on here even though I have nothing to say.  I have the giggles and I am cracking up at everything and anything.  By the way, I finally saw Get Shorty today... I liked it... and this you care about.  Murphys was fun last night, although our waitress cut off Toni and I can vouch she wasn't drunk enough to be cut off... this of course caused tension.  Then we came back to Alan's and he and I went and sat out in the garage last night in the dark smoking cigarettes and avoiding all the automatic light sensors.  So yeah, this was a boring post and it's about as scattered as my mind is.
