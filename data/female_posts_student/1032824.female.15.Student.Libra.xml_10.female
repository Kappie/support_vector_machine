Anyways, i'm gonna get changed now. my parents are taking my sissas, cousins, a coupla' relatives and i out to this japanese restaurant at circular road. somehow or rather, i ain't excited about it at all. maybe cos' i don't really feel comfortable eating out with my relatives. it's just  weird . til' then, keep groovin guys.
