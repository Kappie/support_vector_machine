I used to post in Xanga, but uh I don't like it too much there because of.. uh what's a good excuse?  Well I don't have one! Oh I know... I can't afford the premium service and so my page looks like hell! Yeah...That's it! At least here, I have some excuse, that maybe I just want things simple and ordinary, just ONE advertisement and no calendar..  Ahuh Works for me!   It's 5:30 AM and I have yet to find sleep I wonder why?  Whoever you are that's thinking of me... STOP IT!!  My thoughts are really scattered right now because of the lack of sleep, lately its been that way!  Is it true that you contentment and happiness work hand in hand?  HMmM I wonder...
