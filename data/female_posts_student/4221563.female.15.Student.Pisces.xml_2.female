I love all their records to death, and the most exciting thing to happen in my sad little life was seeing them play for the first time.  There's this internet forum/community thing full of SFK fans who, if you ask me, border on obsessive. I read it occaisonally, because it's damned hilarious. Anywho, Clint, the band's drummer, was on Girl TV for five minutes about two months ago. The forum has this huge discussion raging about how the band are Sellouts and their new albums are Utter Crap (because people actually like them).  I thought this post was mildly amusing: "I must admit, I was surprised when they said they had an interview with Clint but I didn't see anything wrong with them being on that program.Perhaps everyone who watches it wears hoop earrings and hot pants ... I don't know ... but who cares? They probably think the way you dress is amusing. And you can't assume that just because they don't dress/act like you they are not worthy enough to be SFK fans, nor like them as much as you do.Girl TV isn't clubbing baby seals ... Clint wasn't advertising his new clothing label ... the interview was completely focused on the band and him as a drummer. "  Clubbing baby seals, hehe. But seriously, it's like they're debating whether or not depleted uranium should be dropped on Cuba.
