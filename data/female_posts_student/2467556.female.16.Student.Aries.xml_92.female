Here's an update of the week:  Tuesday: boring!  mr. fleming continues to review how to make nametags FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK!!! Wednesday: boring and then i went over to Britt's house for the hockey game which the stars won 4-1 i think.....although with my chronic amnesia i can't really remember....i watched this making of the movie Miracle show and then the SportsCentury: Jim Craig.....it was fun Thursday: boring and then i went to the Coppell Hockey game vs. LD Bell......yeah Haley, i would just like to say that we DID kick you guys' asses 9-1!!!!  I told you we would!  Ah man, LD Bell had the most ghetto-looking hockey jerseys i think i've ever seen from a high school hockey team....they looked like they popped out of the 80's!!!  lol, yeah it was a pretty good game.  The most beautiful goal of the game was by Ashcon Habibi.....and it was so beautiful that i can't eve describe it, you just had to be there to see it.    And today, i am going to a hockey-jessica's puppy party at Jessica's house.  I can't sleep over because i have the freaking SAT tomorrow.....DIE SAT!!!!  I swear, it interferes with my life.  And i'm just going to get below a 1000 like i always do because i suck at math.  Of course, they have to start the SAT at the crack of dawn which for me....is 8:00.  And then it freaking runs until 12.  i hate it with a passion and i can't wait until i just get into freaking college and i don't have to worry about it anymore.    because of the SAT and church this means i will get absolutely no sleeping late this weekend.......oh joy  Now i must run and i'll write up a friend story of the week on Liz Whiting, the Great one and post it on here when i get a chance.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
