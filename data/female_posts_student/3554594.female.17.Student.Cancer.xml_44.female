I cannot shake these feelings for you, but then I'd never had a desire to. The blessing of our love and friendship, is something I want to share with you.  I want to feel you near me, when you're so far away. I hope you feel me in your heart, as you travel your path today.  Footprints in the sands of time, walking closer towards each other.   These are some of the memories, that come with thoughts of you. These feelings are from my very heart, and something you can hold as true.
