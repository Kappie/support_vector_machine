You fucking bastards.  ~  Watch and ignore  see the signs  don’t want to know  Watch him steal  her from me  The wolf with  my beautiful lamb  My baby girl  ~  Could’ve stopped him  Should’ve seen  Searched for help  Bruised, Bloodied  Broken and left  empty handed  ~  My lovely one and only  Stripped of what is  hers.  Childhood.  Safety.  Innocence.  ~  Hard eyes filled with tears  ~  You could’ve stopped it.  ~  Daughters  Girlfriends  Lovers  Wives  Mothers  ~  Congratulations  ~  The world’s a little  dirtier now  because of what  you did not stop.
