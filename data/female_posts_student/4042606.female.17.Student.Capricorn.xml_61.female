Sometimes things work out for the best though, so I am sure whatever choice Jackie makes, it will be a good one. I already knew about Ian's hurt foot, because we talk every night for a while. It seems like it has been bothering him for a while, I suggested that he see a doctor, but I don't think Ian likes doctors very much; as he refused to go no matter what. Anyway I don't have to work tomorrow, so I will sleep in and probably call Ian early, since he doesn't work either. So I guess I will go to bed, and wake up early. Maybe sit on my porch and sip some coffee, and stare at the pond in our backyard. Goodnight everybody, especially you Ian!
