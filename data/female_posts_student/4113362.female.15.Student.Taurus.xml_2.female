We swam in the ocean..the ocean full of stars.....The boys came :) The boys are nice. The boys make me laugh with their theme song music and their duets. They're either really, really good at being players, and really badly need to get laid, or they're really,  really  nice guys.  But either way is fine..because if they're nice guys...good, we got ourselves some more decent friends. And otherwise is just what I assumed the whole time.   I decided we need a car. Cars are good, so are trucks. They make me smile. It's good to be able to say, "Hey, let's go to the beach." at 2 in the morning and then make it happen. Or be cravin McDonalds Apple Juice. **I thank you guys for that, SO MUCH by the way**  I hope you guys had a safe trip home..not smoking weed, talking on the cell phone, and taking turns holding the steering wheel.  I loved swimming in thee ocean. It was really warm. I really  wanted the boys to come swim with us. But they would not swim. Sad, sad stuff. I hope those boys care as much as they seemed to, and I really hope they come back..er..yeah.   The Hornby Trip was grreat. I had so much fun. And there were no boys or alchohol involved. Proud? That's what I thought.  Stephy and I ruined our "Liquor-priviledge" on the first day because the parents did not make it clear how much of the drink we were allowed to sample. Silly parents. While at hornby..we..ate a lot of popsicles, drank a lot of 'bottled beverages' and washed our faces A LOT. We got really tanned. I love being tanned.  Curtis is dissapointed in me because I'm stupid. That makes my heart cry. It also makes my heart feel really..really sorry.
