I on the other hand have had to rewrite a paper about a dozen times and have to leave at 5am tommorrow morning to go to southern Indiana for two days. I get to hang out with a bunch of farmers which is going to be so much fun. In much better news I am getting married. Don't freak out! Its just a joke but I do have to say I think I would marry him if he was even half serious. Here he  urlLink is . About the greatest guy on earth. Too bad he went back to Kansas today :(. Well thats about all I know. Tiff we really do need to decide when we are going to Cali. So let me know what works for you!
