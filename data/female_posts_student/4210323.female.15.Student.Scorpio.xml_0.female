I can almost hear the laughter The priceless gift, God gave I can almost smell the flowers, A new bud blooming each day.  But suddenly, all becomes black Everything is dark again Just as it was before I have lost the radiant star I can no longer feel its light Iâ€™ve lost my way, the path has gone Once again, I am hopeless I have no purpose, I have no use I am nothing but an empty soul, A body with no spirit within.  I am alone in this tragic place I am apart from my companions I am helpless, i am paralyzed I am cursed by this world! Am I ever to see my dreams? Am I never to feel happiness? Am I ever to taste freedom? Am I never to hear my voice? Will this agony ever cease?  Then, I realized, this was all me, i was never cursed. I was able to see the star Because I had opened my eyes, I had let them see me, I had set them free. Everything became black Because I had closed my heart, I had let fear overcome me, I had let fear keep them out.  Now, I am no longer alone. I have found myself, I have found my companions. The world is finally with me.
