There I hung out with Daylin, Mike, Ashley, Lacey, and Jenna and Brittany (these two girls Daylin met at Creation and they go to Conneaut Lake). Then weto went to Daylin's sister house to have a bonfire. Everyone I hung out with earlier was there and so what Kevin and Jake. We hung out in woods (fun unless it's pitch black!) and we play the "question game". Then for 10 min.Zack came..haha. Everyone left around 11 except Daylin, Brittany, and me. We spent the night, and ended upwatching South Park till' 2 in the morning..haha! Then I had to wake up around 9 so I could go to the parade and stuff. After the parade, my family went to Old Home Days to eat..then I went home (none of my close friends were there today :( !) Then I took a long nap because I was so tired!! Tommorrow I'm going to church and I work. Next week is gonna be busy, I work four days and I have driving lessons as well as other stuff. I can't believe summer is half way over! It's makes me sad and depressed!! I've had a great summer. I did some fun stuff, I made some money, and I met some great people too. I just wish stuff like this wouldn't go so fast. As the saying goes "time flies when your having fun".
