Girl 1:  Hey, do you tell on people for eating in the library? 	 Me:  No...(Had this look telling her I thought what she just said was extremely lame) 	 Girl 1:  She doesn't get to eat (motioning to Girl 2)  		Blah blah blah they were talking joking about her not eating at home, how she was like one of those Ethiopian children (real funny)) 	 Girl 2:  What is HiFi? (Looking at my Hoodie that said "AFI", the string was in the middle of the A, making it look like HiFi apparently) 	 Me:  AFI. It's a band. 	 Girl 2:  Is it like that Slipsnot or something? 	 Girl 1:  Yuk yuk yuk. Slipsnot. 	 Me:  No 	 Girl 2:  What kind of music is it? 	 Me:  Uhm, I guess...kind of punk rock 	 Girl 2:  Like Linkin Park? 	 Me:  Linkin Park isn't punk. 	 Girl 2:  Well what is it then? That's my band. Blah blah 	 Me:  Kind of rap rock I guess. 	 	Blah blah.   Another interesting conversation with darling Shelby: 	 Me:  do you have trouble sleeping at all? 	 Shelby:  yea 	 Me:  aww :-( 	 Me:  Im sorry 	 Shelby:  i used to not really but its like my THINK time lol 	 Shelby:  now i'm sorry! that u have trouble  	 Me:  what? yeah it is think time to me too  	 Shelby:  us Thinkers ... gunna kill us from not enuff sleep lol 	 Me:  hehe 	 Me:  yeah haha
