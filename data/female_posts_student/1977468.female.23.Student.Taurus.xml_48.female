I don't remember them clearly, but when I got to the airport noone I was "expecting" was there, because the truth was it was all a front for a special forces mission I was going on. My partner was like WHOA BABY. Not like "hot", but "cute". So we get out there and it turns out all my friends, and my cousin, were in the special forces too! how cool is that?   So we get the briefing, and it was complicated... but my only part was protecting our drop-zone (a tree) with my partner. So they all ran off with their cool guns and such, and my partner (I'm going to name her Steph... steph is a good name for her since she reminds me of a girl I met at camp a few years ago who also happens to never talk to me anymore) climbed up into the tree, but I couldn't find my rifle! I know! so I started feeling around in the knee high african grass and I found this piece of junk rifle from like the 30ies, and the action was allll rusted out. So foes start appearing over the horizen... and what do you suppose they were?   HIDEOUS ROBOTS!!!! They had boxy bodys with the face right on the body, no head... kinda like tiki idols... but so much more lethal. Thier mouths would get tiny and stuff, but then would get circular, which is when you had a chance to shoot them. So we popped alot of them but eventaully they lumbered all the way to our tree! So this "game over" comes down into view and it starts over again.   this time I climb up into the tree with Steph, cause the ground wasn't working out too well. It worked out alot better up there cause we repelled them. So the mission was over right? So my dream fast forwards us talking to her house, at 3 am in the living room. She was a really cool person... to bad she DOESN'T EXIST. So we were having some really great conversations when her mom walked in and was like "your on medication Steph, if you don't get sleep you'll never die". And I was confused so she explained some bogus process of the blood replentishing itself. Yeah. So I went home. I never saw Steph again, and I never will.   So on the next mission I'm sitting alone. Typically alone, actaully. And ERic who was one of the special forces walks up to me with HIS new friend who happens to be a girl. She was a model from one of those russian block countrys, but I didn't want to tell him that she was boring AND not hot enough to be a model. She was complaining that her ex-boyfriend who was a designated "bad guy" stole her sun glasses, and Eric wanted to get them back with Special Forces Power.   So thats when my mom wakes me up and tells me to mow the lawn.   and thats my dream.  And I'm back from Palm Springs, and it was so-so. Too hot.
