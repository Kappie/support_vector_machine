First grade is exam grade, second is semester average.  (I'm not sure I used 'stingy' correctly.  Oh, well.)  Humanities: 95; 94 Algebra II: 100; 98 Communication Applications: 97; 98 (same grade in commapps as algebra?  what the heck?) English: Don't know Orchestra: >97, I'm guessing Biology: 98; 98 Art: 97; 97 French: >97, I'm also guessing  Three people in our algebra II class got A+s.  Me, Kailing, and Tim.  Tim is a claw in my gut.  Since when did he get so good at math?  I am maddened.  He made us into a triumvirate, instead of the "Indefatigable Freshmen".  Not sure that made that much sense, either, but regardless.  It sounds cool.  And it sounds superior.  And superiority is very important when you're a freshman.  Not that I am either superior OR a freshman now.  Then in French, I was so bored and so ready for summer that I just did the exam and turned it in.  Didn't even bother checking it.  Then Lisa, Yini, Stacey and I played cards.  It was very fun and very interesting.  I love them so much.  Then I went around and checked grades!  I was searching for Kailing for the longest time.  Instead, I found Jack.  Joy.  Because we were both at the biology hall.  We both said, "I got a 98!" at the same time.  Then we were like, "You did?  Cool!"  And Lisa was standing there in between us feeling bad.  Poor Lisa.  Then some more stuff happened (I found Kailing), and then we went to the mall!  There were so many people we knew at the mall...  very bad for a person like me.  For some reason, it seems that no matter what I do, I'm still noticable.  I am doomed to be noticed.  Mean Girls was interesting.  The air conditioning upstairs is broken.  It is constantly 89 degrees up here.  I am drowning in urea here.  I'm pretty sure there was a curve on the biology test...  no way could I have gotten a 98.  I mean, missing only 2?  I haven't missed only 2 on anything for a really really long time.  And I was unsure about so many.  I mean... farmers?  What system could both skin and lungs belong to?  What do kidneys do?  I mean... I was so freaking confused!  And I had no freaking clue!  And now that it's summer and school is really, truly behind me for seventy some odd days... I find myself with absolutely NOTHING TO DO.  I mean, not doing anything isn't nearly as fun when you don't have anything better to do.  During the school year, avoiding homework and doing nothing felt greate because not doing anything was at least better than doing homework, right?  And now there's nothing I should be doing.  So the forbidden pleasure isn't so forbidden anymore.  This sucks.  I had forgotten how boring summer is.
