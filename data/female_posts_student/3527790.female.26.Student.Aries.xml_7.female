A shadow cast across    The wall, Filled with happy photographs    Of you and me.  Crept behind us in every room    Of our house.  I never saw him there. Or heard his    Feet on the stair.  Blinded by a box,    He stole your hand. Deafened by volume control.    He led you out.  The crash of the    Door altered me some And I looked up, But, the shadow was gone.  From alley to avenue    I searched. You, I could not find.  It was only then that I realized,  I had a hand in your hurting The white house sits as still as  A vessel at anchor, lighted rooms  Emptied of you belongings
