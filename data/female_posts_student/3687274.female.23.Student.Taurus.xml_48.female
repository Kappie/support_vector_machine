I believe in God, not totally appreciative of Jesus and Mary.  So, instead of calling it Christianity because that's how I was raised, I've decided that I'm not calling it anything.  I'm not Atheist and I'm not Agnostic.  I don't doubt there is a God.  I totally believe that there is a higher power.    ...of this so, this is the last religious post I'm ever doing.
