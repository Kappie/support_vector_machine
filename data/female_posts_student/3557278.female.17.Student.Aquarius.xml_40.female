We all played so well today, but it was a 0-0 draw. Pretty good considering Sharn couldn't play and the team we played are top of the ladder. I reckon we'll kill it. We still have one more game today, against OLMC we are gonna kick their butts :P I was pretty happy, frustrating cos we were soooo close, and now, my shoulder hurts. bah. I was proud hehe ran round lotsa people, tackled, blocked and used my backstick!!      Anyway, i've been looking through my UAC guide and i've seen a bunch of courses im interested in.... here they are (not in any particular order btw)      SYD UNI  -  B Nursing/B Arts  - UAI is 88.2     SYD UNI -   B Applied Science (occupational therapy)  - UAI is 82.25     SYD UNI  -  B Applied Science (leasure and health)  - UAI is 77.50     UTS -   B Arts in Human Movement studies, Grad Dip in Education  - UAI is 84.25     UTS  -  B Nursing  - UAI is (city) 81.35, (umm kooringai nfi how to spell) 78.1     Well there you go.
