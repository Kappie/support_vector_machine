NO LITTLE ANNOYING BROTHER!!! I am supposed to be saving up for holidays, im going to camp ( i wont spend much money there, but i know its by Jasper), and when i go to B.C.! But you see there is a problem... Once i get money... I spend it... usually on nothing much. But my cd collection is slowly growing. so when i get money i spend it on CDS. Oh well. Its worth it. Goodnight. Hannah
