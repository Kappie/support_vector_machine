Last friday, May 7th, I had Ap History, which I totally aced.  Ummm, hello 5!!!  Anyways, after the test, I left early and chilled with laura at the mall.  Then i got up extremely early on Saturday morning with my dad to go to Dulles Airport for my cousin's college graduation.  I slept the entire plane ride and we  got to Detriot at about 10 am.  My cousin picked us up at the airport and drove us to Toledo, Ohio.  My entire family was chilling at this adorable Bed and Breakfast, which we rented for the occasion.  I dressed up in this sexy, slinky black dress, managed to make it through the graduation without falling asleep, and ate some really awesome food back at the B  B.  Later that evening, my cousin invited his roommates over to hang out  we all got pretty wasted.  Even my dad and uncle were doing keg stands (funniest sight ever!)   So yeah, since my relatives were trashed, I ended up going with my cousin and his friends back to their house for a kick-ass party.  After  a few more shots, I started dancing with my cousin's friend matt, who was soooooooooo hot!   Immediately we hit it off, found somewhere to talk, and then started to makeout in his room.   The hook up was awesome...he was a total HOTTIE!  Since the party didn't break up until like 3 am, I ended up crashing at the house. Matt even gave me his bed :)       When I got back on sunday, I talked to Kevin online and he asked me how my weekend was.  I told him what happened and his exact words were "ughh disgusting, i can't believe you hooked up with a 22 year old".  Pshh, he was just jealous that he can't have this!! In fact, today in physics, Mr. Howard said something about how it was a good thing i took this honors class and was glad I didn't leave it in the beginning of the year.  Then he was like "right Kevin?"...and Kevin goes "No, she can leave".  Uhuh, this is coming from the mouth of the same guy that one week earlier wanted to look up my skirt and hook up with me.  BITTER!!  During our parade, which is sorta like our own chill time, we usually all play capitalism (me, tj, sam, and kevin), but today Kevin decided to talk smack about me  his friend Sam to Jessica and Tammy.  Whatever, I didn't care that much because I found out that Sam broke up with his girlfiend!!  That means there is a small possibility that he will aske ME to prom.  Omg, that would rock.  Sam is sooooo funny, cute, smart, tall, and has  a nice bod :)  So, we'll see what happens tomorrow.  Peace, i'm off to cook for my fam...
