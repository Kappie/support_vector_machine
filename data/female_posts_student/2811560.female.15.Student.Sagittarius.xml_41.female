It just felt wrong not to have it. I missed it a lot, which is kinda weird. We got to watch Wizard of Oz in chorus which was fun. That was pretty much all that happened today I think. Oh yeah, I sang my solo at the chorus concert last night, and I kicked some major ass! Yeah, I was good. Lol, so 2 people quit our play today.  A WEEK BEFORE THE SHOW! Yeah, losers. And one of them was Owen, the cute guy. But he turned out to be a total ass, so whatever. He never tried, and whenever he actually showed up to practice, he would always complain. When they quit today, I thought poor Kendra was going to have a heart attack. (Kendra = director) Yeah, and then I went to "Recital Night" and sang my solo and my duet with Laura, and we both rocked. Our first meeting for "Anything Goes" is tomorrow, I am very excited. Hehe, we get to do a read through, so yay. I wonder how that is going to work with double-casting....that reminds me, I will probably have to associate with Kelly tomorrow....woo hoo.
