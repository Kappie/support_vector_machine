I am also very full, and when I say full, I mean my co-workers forced me to eat a lot more than I normally would have. If I hadn't, I would've had the grand inquisition on my ass. That would have been annoying. In conclusion, anorexia does not fly in this office, no way, lol.  Not that I am anorexic by any means. I don't have the kind of discipline it takes to be one, and I hate throwing up, so I can't be bulemic. And I hate dieting.   And if you think I would even TRY and exercise...wow you've got another thing coming honey, lol.   In other news, NPR is good. It makes me feel like the world is still moving and going, even though I am stuck in this little room all day. I like hearing the news, I feel connected to the world.   Carissa and I ordered shirts from  Google , on the back they say "I'm feeling lucky"  Once I get it, I'm wearing it all the time. I don't even own it yet, but I have already decided that it is my second favorite shirt. My first favorite being my Incubus shirt, of course. I love that shirt. :)  Okay, I really do have work to do, I swear.   PS--I GOT MY PAYCHECK!! WOOTNESS!!
