It was the most retarded looking thing ever, and it wouldn't SPIN. and then the little spokey thingies kept falling off so by the time we had to test it for mr. samilenko there were only two left. And we're like "we'll just take the f now" but he steals it from us anyway and is like "you have to test it" and when he put it in front of the fan it like flops over and dies and then another spokey thing falls off and the whole time we are like pissing ourselves laughing. It was good. but then he laughed at us like "your pathetic" and we're like "shut up yanni's number one fan!"
