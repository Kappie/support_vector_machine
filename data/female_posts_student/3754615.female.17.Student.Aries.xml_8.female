I would reather go to ontari-arie-O. I cant wait till next summer. Im for sure going. theres no way i wont. Im going to visit family just in case you reading this and ur like "why the hell would she go to ontario for?" lol well my hole familys there.. i was born there and stuff lol, so i miss em lots. It sucks being so far cuz Id like to see every one grow up and grow up with them.. but  at least i can visit i guess. So yeah im tryen to get alot of hours in at work to tuck away as much money as possible. Im excited for th is week lol i got like 24 hours. Ill probably get bored of work this week but o well lol.. its money. Today was so gay though.. work was good. but then after work we had this stupid PK.. its like a training session on adidas footwear. It was stupid lol. but o well lol.
