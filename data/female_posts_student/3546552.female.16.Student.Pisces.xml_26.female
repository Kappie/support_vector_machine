Well anyway, had some fun today hangin with my  "beneficial friend" ...uh, yeah, and I got to drive his sister to church, she's such a cutie. I sang the duet  Rachel Primrose  and I have planned to sing at  Fine Arts , and had a great time leadin worship too. Hope you had as good of a day as I did. goodnight. ~BS
