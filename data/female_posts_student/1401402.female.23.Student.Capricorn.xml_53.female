A small percentage of my happiness of the day hinges on these people blogging and they don't for like a couple of dayz or even longer. Bloop.  Anyways, here are some of my favorite lines that I've been repearting over and over these dayz.   It's not what you got, it's what you give.  It ain't the love you choose, it's the life you live.  It's not what you know, it's who you know.
