No matter what it is, as long as I can’t cope with it or I don’t well with the situation and I become pessimist, then my tears… Perhaps my teacher was right; I’m too emotional, I couldn’t think or decide rationally. I’m selfish; I only care about myself but neglect the whole team.    Anyway, I make a deal with my section leader today; I appealed to her for one more chance in condition she will examine my skills tomorrow before she make up her mind. If she examines it justly, I swear I’ll accept her decision; however, I couldn’t promise that I will not cry if her decision is out of my expectation.    The competition will be on tomorrow. Feeling nervous and scare. I have no idea about what would be happening tomorrow, neither the quality of the performance that will put up in Stadium Perak by all of us.  I pray hard not to forget any minor steps in the formation. As my teacher said, we really need rest and be relax now. I agree with her. I’m stress with the competition; I feel that I need a good resting time today.    P/s : No disturbance tonight. =)  Competition countdown : 1 day
