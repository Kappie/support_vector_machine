I mean what can one find to do when all there is to keep you company is a bunch of farm animals, her bitchy sister and ok lil bro? I can't say it's different from any other summer, lacking in things to do and people to do them with. But I begin to ponder, If Jesus Christ were sitting here next to me right now... what would He be doing? What would He say? Would He tell me to get off my pity party? Alright, so now I'm not feeling sorry for myself, but I still lack in things to do for the next half hour. I think I'll go sleep, my favorite pastime. Maybe tomorrow will hold something exciting, right and maybe there really is a Santa Claus.
