All the female roles are double-cast, but heres the leads as I know them: Hope: me, Kelly Reuter. Reno: Courteny Hildebrand, Lizz Hansen. Bonnie: Suzie Bilek, Kim Kozeny. Billy: Noah Myrent. Moonface: Eric Zuber. Sir Evelyn: Steve Heldt. Its so awesome, band people totally dominated the leads. Theres like 5 of us, including Suzie because shes color guard. Awesome! I was soo excited, you have no idea. Plus, a bunch of my friends like Jasmine, Cathie, Laurel and other people made the chorus. This musical is going to be so much fun! I can't wait, our first cast meeting on March 4. That's really all that happened today. Yay! So yeah...I guess I'm engaged to marry Steve, but Noah is my lover....meaning I will probably have to kiss him. Lovely. And also, I still don't quite know how I'm going to work with Kelly. I don't know her very well, but from what I do know and what I have heard from other people...she's not the most pleasant person in the world. And supposedly she was mad that she had to share the part with me. We'll see how that goes.
