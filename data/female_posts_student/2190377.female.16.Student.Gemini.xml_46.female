On the love front: You have the attention span of a gnat, so anyone who isn't on the ball is kicked to the curb before you even give 'em a fair shot. That's how you weed out the faint-of-heart, though - when you find someone who sticks in your mind, you know that sweetie's here to stay.   But honestly.. I've kinda given up.  Besides track is much more interesting. to me...   For some reason no one else cares. heh. If I've been babbling to you about it a lot lately I apologize.  but you gotta understand... im going to penn relays!! holy shit!! im gonna get beat up for it because I took the place of Appie i think... oooh man. shes really mad and really good but the coaches think i deserve to go because i work hard (translation: i have no life and always show up to practice.) Either way, yours truly is going to run in a 4X100 and a 4X400 this thursday.  does anyone know how hard running a 400 m dash is? holy shit. AAAAAAGH. SO FRIGGIN HARD. i wanna puke just thinking about it... but im so excited, just sad ella cant go :( what a cool kid. for serious. we had fun on the field trip today, yay for looking at carved bones and being watched by creepy 30 year old men of indeterminate sexuality!! and getting SUPER BURNED. im a redneck... and i mean it.  guys im so excited. now all i need is some action.. and another spring break and a pony.. and a new haircut. and a new HAIRCOLOR agggh.   also nora and jose are so cute. :)  matt isnt as much of a jerk as i thought.. hes just... ehhhhhh lol not to smooth when it comes to making people feel better i guess ?   and kelly and i are going to write a book about how to exploit boys. oh what an exciting life.   i could just pee my pants. for serious. okay maybe not.  also if i didnt mention ur name please dont kill me. im thinking i should just assign people arbitrary numbers or something.. "so friend A was saying to me blah blah blah"
