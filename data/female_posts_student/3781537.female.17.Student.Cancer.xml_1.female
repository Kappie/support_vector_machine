Grrr. anywayz, but then it got a little better cuz afterwards from 11 in the AM til 1:30 in the PM i was alone, so i had time to rest and do whatever. Then i got to talk to Amy and Ben!! whoohoo! i enjoy talking to those two. I went to Pride over the weekend ... well for a couple hours on saturday. I went with a couple of my friends .. two of them were damn heteros, lol. Anywayz, while at Pride i saw this girl i liked last summer. she talked to me for a second then left. I thought there might be hope for me, but then when she left she was holding another girls hand. Which is cool. So since i got home from Pride i have been going crazy trying to find a way of getting a hold of this girl. One of my friends goes to her school and said she could get her phone number, but i know i would never call her. Then i decided to search on planetout.com to see if there was anyone in hazelwood or florissant who could give me maybe this girls e-mail. So i saw a girl who lived in hazelwood, and i was going to write to her and ask her but the profile i found ended up being the girl i saw at Pride. how convenient .. lol. Anywayz ... im done rambling. I should prolly go .. although i have nothing to do cuz i am babysitting my sisters :( . oh well.
