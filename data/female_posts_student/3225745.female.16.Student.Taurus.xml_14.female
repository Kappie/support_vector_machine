I remember all during freshman year.  i could not enjoy a minute of school because i was just waiting and waiting for oakridge to free me from my public school prison.  I was thinking about how i would make all new friends and find a great oakridge guy to date and how i would make good grades in school. I also thought i would get way more involved in my  school and know everyone and have lots of friends.  Where am i now?  well i was involved in my school and i am making better grades but what was i thinking? i thought just because i went to a different school my whole life would change. i would act and be different. i am really no different than i was a year ago. i am still that nervous scared little girl and i now realize i always will be.  it just makes me laugh...the way i thought things would turn out for me and the way they did..hehe
