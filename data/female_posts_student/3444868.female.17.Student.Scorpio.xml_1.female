Drunk people are really funny.  Well Andrew, Austin, and I were outside sitting by the pool.  Austin decided he was gonna start hitting this huge spider that was in the pool with the car keys.  He wasn't expecting it to latch on to the keys so Austin started flinging the keys to get the spider off. Well, in the process he dropped the keys in the deep end of the pool.  We were able to get the keys to the shallow end by hitting it with a pole and then I volunteered to try to grab it with my toes and got soaked in the process.  It was a lot of fun.  Well that's about it for now cause I don't feel like writing everything else that happened.
