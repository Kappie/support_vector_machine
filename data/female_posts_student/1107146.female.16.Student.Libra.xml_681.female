Oh yes, The senior and junior boys some how got a hold of water balloons during the trip. Last night they decided to bomb the Senior/Junior cabins around 12:30. SO around then they climb up to our area...seperate area safty thing...but they were seen by another cabin so to shut them up they bombed them. Then the middle school girl counselor told them that she would help them get us. She walked in (by this time everyone is awake) and asked us to go on a night adventure and to be careful. We locked all the doors and they pelted us with water balloons. Allie then tells Kara to open the door and see if the guys are still there. My bunk is right by the door so as they open the door i get this wonder full view of them screaming (high pitched) and running behind another bunk because allie got hit by a balloon in the mouth (Yes! Go boys!). Anyway the wonderful duo forgot to pull the door close so that the boys have freedom to pelt more balloons into the room. On busts on the ceiling and then dripped onto someone's bed. Another plopped itself on the floor and created a socking carpet. Another landed perfectly cradled on a sleeping bag of a counselor. The couselor grabs is a runs outside ready to pelt them...she's not fast enough. The girls are completely furious and want revenge so we hit them hard! Guys hate periods and pads and tampons... and we didn't have any water balloons so guess what the boys found? Ao we colored the pad and tampons with red lipstick and then soaked them in water...the rain helped.  Then we all snuck down to the boys cabin and found that Brian and some other guy were on the porch...we hauled A to get back to the cabin. After that we sent the 7 senior girls...juniors next year... to plaster then on the porch. We had planned to spell out U Lose but they didn't have time. Amber...really fast... told the others to run as she smacked a pad...very loudly... on the the glass door and threw a blood bomb (tampon...wet) into the cabin. Around 2 we snuck up again and found the guys cleaning up tampons and pads...i love counselors... Also it turned out the we pasted them on the frosh and sophmore side of the cabin so they had alittle girl education as the older guys watched. Phil already has something planned for next year... anyone have any ideas for the girl's come back? Oh yes... I'm running on minimal sleep because of them so I got to be grumpy all day...oh yes a suffocated phil on the buss too. I love retreats. THe speaker had dreadlocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's 28year old white male that has dreadlocks. He's awesome because he has ADD and made the whole Deut. 6:4 interesting. that's the verse on loving the Lord your God with all you Heart, Soul, and Might. Heart was about love and choosing while Soul was unconditional love. He's put off God for along time and he actually told us to lean into our doubts and explore. That way our faith is our own and we trully will find Chris for ourselves.  OH YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! We played football...or rather I watched. I forgot to bring another set of clothes and such. Anyway the Brentwood Bowl was won by the Girl Team named the Cootles...Anyone know what a Cootle is? The trophy was a rubber football with a rose on top while the guy's won a plastic moose...dear...buck thingy. They weren't sure. SO...retreat was awesome. 9th Hour was awesome too. they were the band
