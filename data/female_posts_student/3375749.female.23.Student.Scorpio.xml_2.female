He builds fences for a living. He just landed a 26,000 foot job, which is what he'll be doing for all of June. He'll make great money with that job too, even though he's got practically all of it spent already. He just bought a new truck and tractor, and now he wants a new trailer and 4-wheeler. Go figure. I should be understading and stuff about how he works ALL day out in the hot sun and comes home just to eat and go to bed and do it all over again. But, I'm getting kind of frustrated. I don't know. It's like we don't ever get to do anything fun anymore b/c he's either too tired or we don't need to spend the money on stuff like that right now. I know he's trying real hard to make all this money so that we can build a nice life together.....but..... I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm 23 and I feel like I'm 40. I'm kinda getting resentful of all the time he spends at work. I want  me  time. Or I at least want him to aknowledge me. Like bring me flowers once in a blue moon or  something!  Sigh. I feel like I'm trying to express my feelings but I'm not making any kind of sense. Am I being selfish? Am I making sense?
