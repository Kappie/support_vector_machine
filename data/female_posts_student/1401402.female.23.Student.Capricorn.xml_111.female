It’s a long story but I’ve got all night to explain. And so the story goes…….  The typing department was doing just find until this black woman came along. She was transfer to our office from San Francisco. Everyone knows that she’s a snitch and not everyone like her very much. She is the type that kisses ass with the boss. She’s so coincided. All I have to say is that she’s full of herself.  Working here for so many years I look up to Ann, now Ann knows everything and she’s very sweet. I see Ann as how I see my grandmother. When ever I needed a piece of advice she’s the only one I turn to and I must say that she’s an expert. Things started out find yesterday morning until Carolyn (the black lady) told me about a replacement code for policy she also said that Jim wanted the new code to be added in. From my experience and how I was taught it’s a different code from what Carolyn told us. I wanted to make sure I am getting the rite code so that nothing will come back for corrections. I went over to Ann’s desk and ask for justice. No one has ever heard of the new code Jim has suggested. Everyone in the office disagree with Jim.   I over heard Carolyn said, “Why is she going to Ann for, Ann doesn’t know anything”. So bitch ass, snitch ass took her little behind and went up to Jim’s office. She probably told Jim that I refused to use his new code. Less then two minutes later, Jim came over to my desk. He yelled, “WHY ARE YOU REFUSING TO USE THE NEW CODE I SUGGUESTED? WHATS WRONG WITH IT?  I tought it was so rude of him to yelled at my face like that at nine in the morning. I was so not ready for this SHIT. I snap!!!! My reply was, “WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME, I’M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS STUPID CODE. TITLE OFFIER SAID THAT THE CODE YOU SUGGESTED GIVES LENDER PROBLEMS. I DON’T APPRECIATE YOU RAISING YOU VOICE AT ME. IF YOU WANT US TO USE THE NEW CODE YOU SHOULD JUST AT LEAST SEND OUT A MEMO!!!”.   At that moment the look on his face was filled with humiliation. He walked away saying, “WELL, FROM NOW ON YOUR USING THE NEW CODE.”. I thought what a fucken ass hole, I hate any men who dare to yell at me. I sat at my desk feeling so uncomfortable. I had tears in my eyes but I held strong. I took a deep breath and work on.  Later on that night, Lanie who is now my new supervisor, approach me and notified with me that the entire state corporation shouldn’t be in the policy. She’s been correcting policies for so many fucken years now but has she ever received anything with a state corporation? NO….. Again, I argue with her for my rights. Sknky ass started to fucken cry because she couldn’t argue with me anymore. PEOPLE, I am just doing what I was told and how I was trained. So Carolyn came along and they were just talking, they’ve changed everything in the policy. That’s just hella messed up. Carolyn doesn’t like Ann and wanted Ann out of the typing department what a fucken whore. I hate her ass so much and I hate Lanie for being a dumb ass.   This morning coming to work, I didn’t know what was going to happen. Kathy a very nice sweet lady came up to me and asked if I was okay and that she heard about it and that I should let the other manager know about this and that is I wanted to sue Jim for yelling at me I have the rite to. But you know what, I want to see how far is this going to go on. I want to see the look on Carolyn’s face when she finally realized that being a snitch ass MF isn’t cool at all. Until now, I haven’t spoken a work to her. I’m just so pist off and the anger inside I will always remember.   People will forget what you say to them but people will never forget how you made them feel.
