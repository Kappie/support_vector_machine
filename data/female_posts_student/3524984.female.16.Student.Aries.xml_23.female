He hates you more than anything in this world. Just stop. Please, stop trying so hard. It's severly annoying. I hate you.  Anyhow... now that that is over. I would like to point out that that is not directed to my brother's girlfriend, Vanny. No way. I love her. =)  My hair hardly smells anymore, just a light sent of C-R-A-P... No more L'Or√©al for moi... And I should really go shopping. School is starting in a month and a half...or so. Anyway, I need new clothes! =) I love clothes. I really want a new guitar. Yeah, I really do. But, I'll wait till I have enough money for clothes, school stuff, piercings, SHOES, a tattoo and then MAYBE I'll get a guitar. Or I should just cut my list down. I don't know. =heh, well this was like a 5 minute update. So yeah. Check out my LiveJournal or something I might be updating those soon. Yeah, peace out... SaVVyShay[~]
