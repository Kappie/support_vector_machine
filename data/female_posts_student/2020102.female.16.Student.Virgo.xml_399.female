I have nothing to say, but now you have something to read.   Actually, I just found this band called Finger Eleven. I love them. Someone buy me their new CD, the one that has the song "One Thing" on it.   Okay now I'm out of things to say. If you want something to read SO BADLY, then GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT! Or find someone else's blog and harrass them when they don't post on it!!!!!
