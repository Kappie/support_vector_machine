I suppose i've been too busy smoking water-pipe and moaning over the fact that school starts in less than a week. Horrible! But, if I'd keep you waiting until something ineresting turns up you'd probably have to wait forever. So, here's an update:  Yesterday me, Ellen and Nicole went to a  hippie party, arranged by   urlLink  Oneness    in a park in Stockholm. It was quite good, but kind of amateurishly arranged. The last time, when we celebrated the  urlLink  Venus transit   was so much better. Anyway, this time we watched a medium. She was a big, smiling Indian lady with a southern Swedish accent, sitting on a chair in the green grass. We sat down in front of her together with about twenty other people to watch her go into a trance. After a while she started shaking back and forth, and after a while an old womans vioce came out of her and started talking to us about the tone of our souls and the importance of being true to ourselves. Some people asked her questions, and she answered them all in a mysterious way. Quite interesting, actually.   ~:~  In the evening of August the 14th, me and Nicole challenged the pouring rain to go to a concert in another park. The audience probably didn't consist of more than ten people, all standing or sitting on the stage in order to get under the roof of the wall-less pavilion and avoid the rain. A girl who had had a little too much to drink was climbing on a giant amplifier. Nicole and I hurried in and took a seat on the floor behind the band,  urlLink  Royale madness  . They were absolutely amazeing, and the singer was...well...gourgeous.
