Minus 31 today and I'm wondering why I should even bother getting out of bed (but then reality sinks in and guilt about not going to work starts taking over). Grrr. As some of you know, I am doing my internship working with autistic kids. One of my kids today asked if we were going to the park. "NO WAY!" was my response, and I didn't even give a second to think about that one! Earlier, he even wanted to greet his brother (who was being dropped off in front of the house by a yellow bus) by ATTEMPTING to run outside with just his sweatshirt and sweatpants on (socks too!) Lucky for my fast feet, I caught him in time. 
   Dan FINALLY got his snowboard in (after  only  THREE months!!!) so we are thinking about going to Rabbit Hill to ride this weekend. I heard that Saturday will be -15, and Sunday will be -7. I vote that we go on Sunday since it will be half as cold - I am a wuss when it comes to cold weather. My hands freeze in 2 degrees weather, for pete's sake!! 
   What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
