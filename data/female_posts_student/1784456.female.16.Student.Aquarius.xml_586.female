Oh and respond if you do otherwise I'll keep running around trying to tell everyone. Oh and my mum's got my mobile so don't bother contacting it. (Not like I ever respond any way!) Eek, sorry about that! Mmm... slightly mad. I'm just really tired after SATs, and all that revising *groan* I'm quite scared, Hassal (annoying person) hasn't realised that I've deleted them on msn... yaargh. Mmm, think I'll go back to running round in circles now! Bubi!
