"Weirdo. How did i make a band with these people?" "Remember what i said," says Jesse quietly into Adam's ear, as if he is a spy, as he walks past.  Adam turns around, and finds that Jesse has disappeared.  I go on one date and whole house goes weird. Is this even about the date?  "Hey man." "Eh." "I'm really glad you got a girl and everything, but you know, we're thinking... you can't get too serious. I mean, a date? You should be out there pulling 13 girls a night in a club with us!" advises Ryan. "You're only 18 for God's sake!!" "Yuh... I know man. But she's special. And i've known her since I was like, 3." "Loosen up and forget about her." "Dude, why are you trying to ruin this?" Adam wonders desperately. "Do you think this is all about you?" "What?" "Everybody else is being affected! We only just get a record deal and you go all silent after one beer?? This isn't the old you, Adam, and you know it. She's changed you. It's only been a few days but you've changed so much. You weren't even excited when Mickey bought a pornographic dot-to-dot book yesterday. What's up, man?" "There's nothing wrong. Why have you all got against this?" "Do you realise that we have to record our songs soon, Adam? The last thing we need is you with Janice on your mind and everybody else worried about your awkwardness!" "The name is Jane." "Whatever. I'm sorry about yelling at you, man. Anyway, there's a party tonight. It'll help you loosen up. And she won't be there, don't worry. Just get off with a few girls and you'll remember what it's like to be single and in a band again." Silence. "Fine," says Adam. "Fine."
