Halo is consuming my will to get off the couch  I'm b e a t today.  Can't deal with it  Today is my last official day here at work  I literally don't have to do a goddamned thing all day here at work  I have the cutest boyfriend  I'm in the mood for sushi  I need a nap  iPods are the one gadget everyone needs to have  The Hillcrest Boys crack me up  Bex and I are going to learn to play hockey
