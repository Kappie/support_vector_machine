I feel so weird for putting the stereo in the bathroom, but hey: better than thinking to yourself, it's something to make you think POSTAL SERVICE for you. And here Enid would roll her eyes and mention the name of some recondite, more sophisticated band. Sorry, Enid.  Mrs. Battaglia has just discovered my penchant for dangling modifiers. Sorry, Mrs. B. I'm not tempted to change it at all. Journalism's actually ok, but probably because we've pushed deadline a day back. Page one just has the strange teaser pic that can only be fixed by Jonathan...actually, thinking about it, I think I screwed it up enlarging it in Pagemaker. Page 2 should be done, provided that Mrs. B. read it and printed it off today. And if she's closing it, I hope she took that top picture up before it's errors type 1, 2 or 3 again. Page 3 is in the box. Dorothy did decently well this issue, but she still has room to improve. I'm tempted to put together a handbook for her, or any other aspiring news editor. Typical problems, yes: standardization issues, unnecessary optimism.  First thing this morning: I called someone by his dead brother's name. Not to his face, of course. I just feel so icky inside. But there's hope.  There is no feeling like falling in love, provided that you don't do it very often.  Just when i think I have it hard, I know C has it worse. More piano competitions, tutoring, just earning any sort of money for college. And AP classes. So I can't complain. A new Chopin ballade today. A-flat major. So now Bach, Ravel, Schumann concerto, and Chopin. I have work to do.  Stepped out of the shower and realized that I have physio studying to do too. I hate people mooching, I just can't help it. Especially when I don't know them except in the context that they keep on asking me questions about homework. 90% of the time Mark IMs you it's for the Spanish homework, as if it weren't written on the whiteboard every day in class. Then he asks me for physio answers just now. I say I don't really have them. How are you going to do the test? he asks. I just haven't checked them yet, I reply. And then Heather asks too. Mind you, I'm not an anal person. I just think it's kind of unreasonable, perhaps? that people just ask me for answers and favors without a) being apologetic about it (hey, sorry for bothering you, I'll help you out sometime too) or b) ever returning the favor. I think Heather and Mark only did Excelsior in terms of doing a favor for Lydia, and even then it was on a completely voluntary basis.  People have no shame, no propriety, no sense of self-worth. No character. Potty mouth me: moochers can just go to hell, it's not like they're getting into a good college anyways. And for the cheaters like H and J and other lowly folk, screw you all, seriously. I hope your miserable life reflects your miserable lack of good character. How in the world do I, working for every grade I earn and feeling damn good about it, stay in the same class as someone who's as weak and stupid as to just copy answers and scrape by? When we no longer have to hunt and scavenge for food, survival of the fittest means the survival of the most intelligent. I just hope those idiots live out a mediocre life at best, not able to enjoy the best things in life: hard work, self-fulfillment, self-truth. Being able to know that every part of you is yours, knowing that you're whole. I'm surprised they haven't killed themselves yet because they feel their life is so pointless, that they're such weak characters. I certainly would to save the world a hell of a lot of trouble.   FRIENDSHIPS ARE RECIPROCAL, stupid. Fuck it, I'm not going to give you more answers when you are of absolutely no use to me. Why do I care for your welfare, when you can just go off to some other answer slut and get it? Losers, the whole lot. I don't give a damn about what you take for the SATs, what classes you should take, what the answers to the physio packet are when it concerns you.  ARGH.  No more swearing. If you're reading this, I wouldn't worry about anything I ranted about. You know you don't do it. I hate too many people. But with that, I know who my friends are.  Let's go play with text boxes. And waste time when I could be memorizing physio notes.
