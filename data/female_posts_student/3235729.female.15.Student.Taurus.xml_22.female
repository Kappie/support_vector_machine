"school's out"?  everyone  knows that song. if you don't, you must be living in a fish factory or something. lol but yeah this concert's 108 days away. that's a long ass time to wait. but we'll manage somehow. we managed getting through the 55 days to distillers. mind you, this is practically  double  to wait. but. oh well.  what else is new with me? oh...it's my parent's 10th anniversary today. i think. we're going out for supper tonight. or something. ooh and its been exactly one month since the distillers concert. i must say, the day 25th is doing wonders for me and linz's concertness.  but yeah i'm gonna bail. laaater.  may  blog later.  maybe.   -joebie
