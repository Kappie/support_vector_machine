It's my youth group and I want to do all I can to be involved and make it a better place.  I am really beginning to value the time I spend with the people in my youth group.  I don't know if that's because I'm around unsaved people all summer, or because it's beginning to hit me that I only have 2 more years left.  Whatever the reason may be, it's made me want to make the most of everything I do with them.  The people are so open and loving.  Last night at the Prelocks I had so much fun.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  Being able to talk about God without being criticized is an awesome privilegde.  I look up to so many of the people and love spending time with them.  I know many people that are in our youth group don't come to many things because they think it's boring.  I think it's all about the attitude you have.  If you go into something thinking it's going to be boring, you'll have no fun.  But if we all step it up and start coming to things and make it fun, we could have a blast.  We have great leaders who really care about us.  They're not out to get us or make us miserable.  They only give us rules because they love us and care about us so much.  I know last night was a blast, but I also know that many more people could have come.  So let's change our youth group.  We have so much potential.  The more people that come, the more fun we will have.  Let's make this summer a great summer for our youth group.
