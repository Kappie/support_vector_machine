Anyways, I noticed Sally's was next to it and I asked her whose locker it was. She goes, "H, I, J, K... Yeah I don't know" Then she opens it up and is like "OH I thought you meant beer bottles!" Then she takes out a book sox from her locker, opens it, puts the book sox on her head, hold the wrapper up to my face and says, "This is hazardous to children!" It was so funny!  Flag football was freaking crazy today. I was bad, I always am, but today especially. I was hiking the ball to the QB, but Pryor was there, so I didn't know who I was hiking it to, and I hit him with the ball smack in his face! It was so funny! Ann threw the ball and I was walking back to the line, and it completely hit me in the shoulder. Thanks.. I like you too. Hart clogger kept running into me and he was so damn sweaty, it was foul. It was also funny, cause Pryor got the ball, and Hart clooger goes to two-hand touch him, but leaps in the air and lands on him, it was crazy. And Pryor's razor burn is back in full action. Ann was trying to sing "Miss Susie" and she completely butchered the song. She sings, "The boys are in the bathroom kissing the flies are in the warehouse and it's D-A-R-K!" It was really funny, Megan fell on the ground laughing.  Dancing was great. Liz was my partner, but I am more manly than she can dream of being. But she's taller, so I just can't be the guy! We moved towards the leaders and crazyness unfolded. The dancing was really hard. But it was funny.  After school we Ace stalked. He's from Hammonton, NJ, that's 8 hours from here. Road trip anyone?
