(Like one minute short of done.)    Unwrap all the caramels (fun while watching West Wing; keep wrappers away from curious cats), and add to condensed milk in a big bowl.  Microwave till all melted and gooey together, stirring often to make sure they don't burn.  Poke some holes in the cake with a chopstick, and pour all the caramel all over the cake while it's still somewhat warm.  Throw some chopped pecans on there, and nicely place some Turtles somewhere where they'll look pretty.
