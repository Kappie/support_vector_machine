Cuz I wasn't able to go on the internet for, like, about a week so I am completely off!!! *sings* If I was a ball, I'd be bouncing off the wall....    OK, I promised the article.... voila! (I'd like to say, before the article, that Tim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo fame sang "Hockey Skates" with Kathleen at Bluesfest. It was wonderful!! Kathleen kissed him and when he got off stage she went (singingly), "I got to kiss Tim Cuddy..." *grin*)
