My theory is that since we are all law students and have at least two finals in the next two days, we start our afternoon before by finding something we "have" to do in order to stall. Plus, there are only four little machines here and two dryers, and the people in line get pretty ugly. I beat them to it since I had an 8 o'clock for my first class and not promoting the rule of law, but I still had to wait two hours for a stupid machine. You might think that during this time where everyone is waiting for a machine, that we all must have brought our books to study...no...there were trashy romance novels cracked open, one dork studying [he's not really a dork, I don't thinnkhe has read for class at all yet], and myself who likes the stare at the wall for awhile routine. I find a few moments a day filled with absolutely nothing are quite refreshing. But, whats really funny is the state of my room now. I have clothes hung up everywhere, and the room just seems to smell wet.       I talked to mom today. I hadn't really felt homesick until then. Yuck. I also hadn't called her since Spain, and with Cochran's final looming over my head, I wanted to hear her voice. So, I made the trek into town and finally found a good phone card. Then I tried to find a free pay phone it would work on, I called her finally and didn't want to get off the phone. Some other students were walking by the booth and I felt my face scrunching up to cry and I thought I would lose it and everyone would see. With all that has gone on, my friends getting academically excluded, and/or not being allowed to come to Innsbruck, losing a relationship I thought meant something, and realizing I was going to have to brush myself off for the start of a new school year soon without the benefit of those I had grown so close to, it just sucked. There are times when I pride myself on being so head strong and independent and times where its nice not to have to. God, I wanted my mom so bad, I felt like a little kid. So, stupid, but I am just not very happy right now and more than that I feel some extreme dissatisfaction with the endings of late. Nothing feels safe or predictable, like my volvo with all six airbags, its all so rocky and full of upheaval. Hearing how my mom has taught my dog to respond to new words, and how he's doing things I bent over backwards trying to teach him, but he wouldn't do, damn, it sounds like my life is going on without me in it. It feels like my friends are dropping out of the picture, my boyfriend [excuse me "ex"] is no longer a consideration, and I'm treading water watching it all get sucked into the tide. I really am upset, and I have t-minus24 hrs. and countingbefore Cochran's test. I'm venting, sorry.
