THE RETURN OF THE MOTHER FUCKING BLOG! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUNNNNNN.  i havn't updated since I got back from california, and there is just so much to write that, um, i'm not going to.  i'll be happy to show you pictures.  all you need to know is: A BIRD LANDED ON JASONS' HAIR BECAUSE HE/SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A PERFECT NEST!  that really was the best thing that's ever happened since the creation of cheese. and the whoopie cushion. and cake.  mmmmm, cake.   I LIKE TO CHANGE IN PHONE BOOTHS TOO  i went and talked to MY EDITOR (it makes me feel grown up to say that... where is my minivan??) and it looks like things will work out for the summer.  i'm not getting much money for each story, but if i take a picture i get double the pay. also, they have a magazine coming out in the fall, and it looks like i'm going to be doing most of the feature stories for it.  help! eek! any ideas?   GONZO MEETS THE SHARK IN FRANCE  it's been such an awesome week. this past weekend was great at danny's parent's lake house... i had a blast, and i suggest you go to  urlLink kentesheia's blog  to get all the dirty details. i saw and did things that i never, ever, ever in a million years imagined could be possible.  i've been busy all week doing stuff... last night was lots of fun.  eh i'm too tired to write about it. that's another thing, i'm always tired now! what is up with that?   YOU THINK IT'S A GAME?? ARF ARF ARF!  i've become obessed with my dog. i talk to her. i sing to her. we dance and play all day long.  something is very wrong with me...
