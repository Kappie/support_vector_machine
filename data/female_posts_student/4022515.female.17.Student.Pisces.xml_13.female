While of course this sucks, and the bad definatly out weighs the good,a few good things have come out of it. I seriously thinkI could write a book about the benifits of being emotionally devistated. First of all, I have no apetite. Heres what I've eaten in the last4 days:      two bites of frosty at wendys    one chicken nugget with honey mustard sauce    a glass of milk     Since leaving for IU, I've lost5 lbs, so thats good i guess. On the other hand, I'd rater weigh 400 lbs and have  kevin . **sigh**
