Even the intelligent standards of Lauren gave surprising approval. Yeh so, afterwards we all felt kinda bloated from our boost juices that we had during the movie, we decided to work it off by shopping...Yay...After a while we worked up an appetite so we got some fast food and sat next to a scary bumb. We decided to go to Timezone, except not for the  i-take-your-money-and-stuff-up-your-game  machines but for the  i-take-your-picture-and-cut-off-your-head  machine. We managed to get 6 people in the one little photo! Its a world record i tell you. It was one of those neopick machines not a passport one by the way. Yeh so after decorating our now unseeable wallets with stickers we decided to head off home. Bubs took Han, Beff and i to Ellen's restaurant b4 Beff and i got our bus. I expected it to be like a random little take-away place, but surprisingly they had this full nice sit-down restaurant thing happening. On our way back to the bus stop Han and I bought two nice white fluffy identical scalves. I have needed one for so long. Yeh, so that's about it, Beff and I got on our Davo bus and went home, and lived happily ever after.  Well, that was my day. Feel free to comment bout ur boring day. (poor Davo pplz) LOlove CM PS. I cant wait to go to sleep and have a sleep in, i got up at like 7 this morning, i guess it was the price i had to pay.
