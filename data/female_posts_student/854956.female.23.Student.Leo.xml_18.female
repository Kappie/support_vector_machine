Which was good, considering that was the norm.  He has evil exams like my Psych professor.  "What is the rainforest?  A) An environment which has a canopy.  B)An environment containing many complex organisms.  C)  A place where monkies sleep in trees  D) Two of the above  E) A, B, and C are correct"   BASTARDS!  It sucks... I mean, trust me, the questions were much more difficult than that, but that served as a good example of the set up of the ENTIRE EXAM!  50 questions like that!  I wanted to pull out my hair.  Anyway, I'm glad I got a C.  I'm already doing better than last time.  Okay, so, Friday night, didn't do anything.  Saturday I just kinda bummed around the house all day while my parents were in Kerrville.  Then Melissa and I decided to go see Sweet Home Alabama.  It was a great movie, aside from the stupid high school girls that were sitting around us, "awww"ing at EVERY single thing that was cute.  It'll be a harsh reality check the day they realize that guys really aren't that sweet to women.  Anyhow, it was an excellent movie.  And so then on Sunday my Mom kept saying she wanted to go see it.  Yes, you guessed it!  I got dragged to see the movie again the next night.  But I have to admit, it was more enjoyable the second time around, being that hardly anyone was in the theater.  I dunno, I welcomed going to the movies again, because I sorta got completely forgotten about.  See, I was supposed to see Wolf before he left.  Ricky was supposed to call me on Sunday when he woke up to let me know when I'd be able to come over or whatever to see Wolf and watch Friends with them (taped from Thursday).  I never got a call.  I finally called at like, 4... and found out that they were going to do something else, and that they were leaving soon after.  Yeah, so, that sucked, and I was really hurt.  But no one cares about that.  Let's talk about today and how I didn't wanna get out of bed to go out in the cold rainy weather to go to school.  That sucked.  BUT, I have accumulated a new and interesting SI Mike tidbit.  He has a hoody.  HAHA  I swear, it's not that often that I've seen a guy wearing a hoody sweatshirt jacket.  But today, lo and behold, SI Mike was wearing a grayish-blue one.  I know it's cheesy and hoaky that I find him choosing the same form of warmth as me amusing... but I gotta get my excitement somewhere, and watching the vinegar turn to jam has lost it's oomph.  This week is going to be Hell for me again seeing as how I have a Psych test on Wednesday, a test in Masterpieces of Music, and a paper due in Masterpieces as well.  It's gonna SUCK.  And this weekend won't be any treat either, because I'll be studying for my stupid World Civilizations test.  BLAH!  I hate World Civ.  I hate going to the class, because the lectures make no sense, and they are boring.  Historic stuff (especially early civilizations) is boring to me.  At least in my other classes either the content or the Proffesors are amusing.  Like my Biology professor, and his violent thrusts of the head when he gets confused.  It's so funny, he shakes his head so fast, and so hard, that it makes his hair fall out of place, and he has to fix it.  Repeatedly.  He gets confused a lot... like he says a wrong word, or he'll stop and be thinking really hard to think of what he wants to say next, and then he shakes his head (hard, mind you), fixes his hair, and go onto a different topic entirely.  Crazy old Dr. Jordan, always good for a laugh.  :-P  Okay, this is all I have for now, kiddies.  I'll post more later in the week once I've gone completely insane.
