NO it doesnt work like this, I have so much anger and everything else built up i'm not in the mood to be messed with, but i held feelings in and i went downstairs and calmly told my dad that he needed to do something with austin, then my mom is like what happened and i told her and she is like that doesnt sound like austin! WTF i get so angry she thinks austin is just a little angel, then i go and my room to cool off and when i come out austin is all happy and is like "do you want to go to starbucks?" i'm like Not with you! i hate him and my mother!
