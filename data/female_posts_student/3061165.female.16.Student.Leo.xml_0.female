To me at least i know more about the current affairs liao... (I dont really read newspaper or watch the News u see... =p) Whoo~ But i was just reading the Life! of The Straits Times! Haha... Read mainly on Barry Manilow... Cuz American Idol(AMI) mahx... Hehe... He appeared as a guest judge once on AMI3. Many say he looks like Clay Aiken(when he's old).. Haha... Maybe? Well, can't believe it! He's 50+(i tink?) now and still releasing album! In fact, he's working on another one now! Geez... Never heard of his songs before.. Will it be as nice as Clay's? Hmm...  Enough of Mr Manilow... We had a *REAL* boring talk by Mr Ee... Geez... Zip you mouth? -_-"  Why don't any English teachers correct him? Is it because of... Scared got sacked? Hehe... Anyway, we had a new teacher teaching SS... The name's Mr Fairizal. Pretty okay teacher, more or less friendly and spent the first lesson sharing his experience in his secondary school life with us. Not bad. Chinese teacher tot change to Mr Sun.. Turn out to be She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named again. How boring~~ Yawnx. Oh, we had our P.E teacher change to Miss Mayanti(spelling?). Oh man! I prefer Mr Shawn! Wat to do? School's the Boss... >.  After school had lunch with my friends and didn't play basketball(cuz dun hav).. So went home lorz... Haha... Not bad for the first day. Not as boring as i expect. But it's still.. Boring. =p  P.S: 4E Friends out there reading this, CHIOOONG your studies like mad goat raping innocent child now!(WeiRd? ^^") This's your last year! Make full use of it! ;)  P.S2: 4E Friends out there reading this, if you pass your 'O's with flying colours, why? It's because of my advice! Hehe... Just joking... ^^"  Today's quotes from Life!...    Barry Manilow(Clay's dad? Nono... ^^)   Quote: In Asia, casinos have typically been for gamblers, but in United States, the whole family goes to the casino for great food and entertainment. Quote 2: Casinos want winners, believe it or not. If you make the clients lose all their money, they'll never come back.
