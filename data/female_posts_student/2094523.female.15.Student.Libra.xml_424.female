I really shud study but well.. lifes too good to turn to studying. honestly! the only thing good about finals are once u finish it.. its frikin over!  "Am I the only one that feels alone Though, all is home Emotions flow Am I the only one that hears the tears run down my face Would anybody recognize at all" --> Unwritten Law- Rest of My Life   The farther and farther apart we drift, yet i won't swim the length to come back to you, and nor will you. So whose to blame?   Come summer im goin to get a hottiemabody i swear. and if i dont..well its not the end of the freakin' world. Everytime something doesn't go your way, get up off ur ass and live. the world hasnt end yet as much as it seems liek it has. When ur hating life.. get up and fix it. Everyone thinks that things cant be fixed well u knwo what? its what u make it to be. My encouraging words.. USE IT
