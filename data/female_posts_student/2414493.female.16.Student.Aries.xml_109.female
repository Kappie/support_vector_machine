One disgusting dream, another ok one, but maybe I've learned by now: you don't expose your dreams (or your wishes) for fear of them not coming true.  I had three birthday cakes. I made the same three wishes. Only on the last cake did I remember that I wanted anything else in life. Isn't that weird? But I shan't divulge. At any rate, speaking of cakes, Keira's bday is in 26 days. I'll have to keep a good watch. She's the journalism birthday cake queen and only a good cake would do her justice.  Am thoroughly disgusted at some people who made NHS, and others who didn't. Chaddy didn't, and neither did Charlie or Andrew or Anna Cao or Jordan. Maybe some of the rejected people didn't do that much community service. But it just makes my blood boil to hear that some people put the loveliest crap in there and got in. I'm interested to see who's going to be at the induction tomorrow night. Some people I'm completely ok with, and I know they've done their job. Jess. Tiffany. Nige. Others...I really would like to see their sorry souls burn in hell, to put it lightly. Maybe that's the next column (for the senior issue, yikes!) but I'll have to consult with Mrs. Freeman before I do. It's only fair. I'm sick and tired of people cheating. I'd be ok if they didn't affect my performance, but it's eating away at my relative performance, too. I've already written about cheating before. Would it be more effective in column form? In terms of high school, it's the one thing that infuriates me. My grade is completely mine, but others have the audacity and are so stupid as to have to copy. I wonder how they can look in the mirror at themselves. I hope life grants them an admission to a university that only sends out those terrible flyers because they don't have enough people. I hope they live the rest of their lives in a terrible marriage, in a boring job. I hope one day they'll realize how much they've fucked up their lives, but then it's too late, and then they die.  Satire's the trick, maybe.
