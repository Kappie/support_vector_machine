There must be something, i don't go around making it fucking obvious that i still feel for my ex, yet i still attract complete arseholes, and my ex shows pictures of me and him to someone that i am interested in? Why do that? Why?  So what if Laura has big boobs, shes not pretty, she talks about sex because she is a slag, and shes been around, theres nothing great about that, so she might be clever, arghhhhhhh she annoys the fuck out of the stupid slut, such a hussy, she has what i want, she stole it, took it away, and i got no good reason, i wasn't even going to be told that he had cheated, oh fucking no? How can she trust him knowing he cheated on me with her? But she really can't trust him, i slept with him girl, and he could have come to see you that Monday night 2 weeks ago but instead he came to me... You not good enough? Aww dear... Hes going to Malta, three guess's what hes going to get up to love, do you blame him? This is casual for him, you can tell, i bet he still flirts with people, still chats up people, and i bet you anything he tries to sleep with people, god it sucks beyond belief... Yes, i am sour, yes i am bitter, and yea i do love him, stupid questions to ask me thinks, doesn't mean i don't think hes a prat.   ~Lisa~
