Is that normal, or does that just make me paranoid? I wouldn't mind being paranoid. I'm already planning on living out in the boonies all by myself. With my dog. So not all by myself, because I'll have a dog, but enough by-selfness that it'll finally be    SILENT.   People never know when to shut up.
