Her parents were outa town.  Friday CM came over to my house all day until I had to go to work at 5. UGHHHH! WORK!! I hate it there. After work CM came back over and we just hung around my house for a while. I was pretty exhausted from work so he went home at like 12:30.  Saturday morning I went to CM's for breakfast, then he went to see Spiderman II with me and Nick and Kristina and my parents. Then we went to the Astro's game. WE WON!! Hell yes. It was all about Biggio. Yeah freaking right. I think I'm gonna have to start dealing with the fact that Biggio isn't so great anymore...*sniff*  After the Astro's game I went to CM's with him and we just hung out.  Today was the 4th of JULY!! My favorite holiday!! I woke up LLLLAAAATTTTEEE. It felt so good to sleep late. My cell phone woke me up. It was Austin and he was just calling to see what I was going to be doing for the fourth. LOOOOSSSSEEERRRR!!!!  CM came over at 2, we went to the store to buy some stuff for him mom. Then we went and had BBQ at his house with his family and then back to my house to eat with mine. UUGGHH!! SOOO FULLL. It's like Thanksgiving all over again. HAHAH! =)  After dinner we went to CM's and bummed, then we went to watch fireworks on top of the Marriott. It was so cool cause you could see fireworks from every single direction. Like every single place in Houston that had fireworks, you could see 'em from up there. It was perfect. Then me and CM came back over here and at mid night he left to go party at Jorge's.  Mel called me today and was mad becasue she said that her dad found a beer can in the fridge from when we partied over there. She made up some story about me and christian bringing them over. Her dad was pissed though.   Whenever me and CM and Mel and Craig were hanging out on thrusday it was pretty cool. Craig isn't so bad. I just dislike the things him and CM do when they are together.   Tomorrow I'm going to sleep late again and then I think I may go up to marshall's and look for some more shorts cause right now I have like 2 pair that I wear. PLUS: Our dryer is broken so I can't wash clothes. Whatever.  Tomorrow I'm on call at work from 5-close. I hope they don;'t use it, but I know they will. Jennifer works tomorrow night until close though, so even if I have to go in it won't be so bad.  Today, me and CM went over to Michael's cause he was having people over for the 4th and Christy was there and she brought Emily. When me and CM walked in we didnt even look at Emily and then as we were leaving, I was like "Bye Mike, Bye Christy." really loud, and didn't say shit to Emily. HAHAH!! Crazy bitch. I hate her so much. All I wanted her to do was acknowledge that what she did was wrong, and apologize. But hell no, she can't even do that.  WHAT-EVER! As we were leaving (me and CM) I got out and poured a diet coke into her gas tank. It was kinda like a spur of the moment thing that we were joking about doing and I didn't think I was really gonna do. It was very liberating though. OOOHHH WELLL! I hope her car breaks. Is that so awful?  I actually wish that I could do worse things to other people, but I wont even get into that anymore. It's over right? I just gotta keep telling myself that. It's over. It's over. It's over.  WELL Ladies and Gents, I'm heading to bed. I'll write more regularly I think from now on. Sweet dreams.  HUTH...OUT. hahahahaha  =)  *whit*
