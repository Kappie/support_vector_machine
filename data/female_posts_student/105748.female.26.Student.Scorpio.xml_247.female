I might post pictures of the dress that I actually picked, but I'm still trying to decide if I really want to post them or not. I'd like to invite you guys to the wedding, but I can't guarantee accommodations. My mom has a small house, we have a small house and we don't have any money. Besides, I don't want to obligate any of my online friends to come. I don't want to be too pressumptuous. For one, I don't want to assume that any of you will actually take time out from your work/life to attend a wedding of someone you hardly know and have never-ever met in person. Secondly, Kansas is pretty boring. Other than the wedding and reception, there's really not much to do here. I'd be totally thrilled if you all came, but don't blame me (for the rest of your life) if you get bored and don't have any fun. I'm telling you now, if you're planning on any kind of partying during your stay, the night life is non-existent.    All that aside, if any of you are interested in attending though, just email me your address and I promise to send out an invitation and rsvp card.
