However, in the evening when I was on the computer, my parents started yelling in their bedroom below me.  My mom was having one of her stupid you've-ruined-my-life breakdowns with my dad.  So, since I was going out with Cassie and Ellen anyways, I just decided to stay the night.  I had received gift certificates from Target so we went there, and I ended up buying $30 worth of Harry Potter stuff: trading cards with a tin, more trading cards, a little figurine set, and a HP tshirt!  That is what I do when I am stressed -- I buy things.  And then I bought Icees for Cassie and Ellen.  We went to Best Buy, too, so that Ellen could get CDs.  I tried to call my mom to figure out the date for teh Evanesence concert, but she wasn't at home and wouldn't turn on her cell.  We were really tired by then...  So we just came back to Ellen's house, and I spent the night at Ellen's because I didn't want to go home to my arguing parents.
