I have an excuse, Izzy ate me. Ok, so actual excuse: I was at Laura's house and we were doing Jean-Claude manga! Yeah, that super crap super dumb story is now a crap manga too! It's sooo funny! We've only got the front page and chapter 1 page done. I'm doing the chapter one page and it's good if I say so myself... which I do... Uhuh... Any way it's called ivre, which apparantly means drunk in French... Oh, it's a French manga! Yeah ok then... french manga written by english people in a japanese style... Woohoo! Jean-Claude looks sooo funny! He's got a curly mustache *whatever* and beree *BIG whatever* and erm oh yeah black and white top! Like robber style! All we need is a big swag bag now! Ok... ok... I'm going! Bubi!
