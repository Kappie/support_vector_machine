I hate her, that bitch stole the one thing that i wanted, the one thing that made me happy and i thought life was living for and she had to get her stupid claws in, i hate her for it, hate her with a passion, that i didn't think i could hate with, she is now sleeping with and spending time with that person as she is now with that person, you big fat stupid little tart, you don't deserve Marc and you certainly don't deserve Jason in my eyes you little slag, he needs someone to be nice and supportive, and your a pathetic little cheap tart who needs to learn her lesson, i so want to tell you that he cheated on you, i so want to do it, but i can't bring myself to lose what friendship i do have with Jason. He means that much to me slut, means that much to me that i want him to be happy, just Jason, don't throw away the book, don't throw away our pictures and don't tell her you love her like you did me, we were good and special, and you know it. Please, i wish i had the guts to tell you.   ~Lisa~
