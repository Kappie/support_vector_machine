After work i went over to Emily's for her birthday party! *YAY* We watched Sixteen Candles [yes john cusack does have a FEW lines], ate pizza, cake, opened presents, and watched CLUELESS! The caps and exclamation mark are def. needed there.  It was really fun! Even if i was a reject due to my non-explorisness.    Friday i worked again..this time from 9 15 to 2 15.  I love those extra 30 minutes.  It was really fun...clint and scott were hilarious and tiffany had candy =D  Clint gave me a ride home and i took a wee nap and talked on the fone to brad [lucky bastard's at the beach ] and danielle before going out to eat with my parental units.  Yummy veggie pizza @ CAH.  Then i headed over to...*drum roll* CHRISTINE'S HOUSE! Who woulda guessed it..?  Today we had a BLAST! Headed out to falls lake and hung out on the boat/in the water/on the tube all day!  It was really fun! Some of the waves were HUGE! And bikinis are great for fast speeds...Yummy food too [ew on fluff, peanut butter, and jelly!] Mmm..strawberries!  Got a little bit PINK, oh well! Hadta have fun on my day off! Plans for tonight?  Watching olympic trials, music, and SLEEP!
