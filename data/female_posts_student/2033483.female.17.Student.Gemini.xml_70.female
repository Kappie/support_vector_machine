Italian people must have stomachs made out of iron because that stuff can really mess with ones stomach.    Today, kinda sucked.  I got two more graduation open house invites today from Lexi and Liz, that didn't suck tho, it just means my Saturday is more busy.  Thank you Lexi for having your's on Friday!  Algebra was dumb because all we did was review and in Lit and Comp we did some grammar review for "fun" which just made me feel stupid because I couldn't remember any of it.  In History Anna and I presented our project so I am officially done with Hell.  All I have to do is show up on Wednesday.  Lunch was mass chaos for food.  I seriously had to push people just to get to the beverage container.  During Chem we reviewed and we did the same in Physics.  During Newspaper we did nothing productive which has been our routine since we stopped printing on Friday...well Thursday for me.  The Nationalist comes out tomorrow so that will be good.    I'm not ready for finals.  I'm not ready to be a senior.  I'm not ready to loose some people.  I'm not ready...but it's happening.    Good Luck tomorrow! ~Kayla
