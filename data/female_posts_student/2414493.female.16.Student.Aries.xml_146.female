I just don't get how Mom, inspired by the fact that she was a little too slow at Costco yesterday to read that they, too, could record pictures onto CDs, went out to Fry's today to get a $1500 computer. With a CD burner. Mind you, she doesn't even know where the camera software is. May I wish her the best of luck? Yes, I will, because I predict it'll be another Mom-Austin yelling fight before she unearths the darn program. Um, yeah.  Arr, I can't wait to get out on my own in this world. And I can't really understand why I'm angry, either. Maybe it's that I'm going away over the summer with the oldest laptop in the house that doesn't even have a battery anymore. But I'm glad I'm going, getting some fresh air. I think we need some brilliant Asian kid to go crazy because of the pressure just once. It should scare the parents into submission, wouldn't it?  So it's this weird month or so when I'm 16 but I don't have a license. I wish I had the sense on October 13 to run into the DMV to take that test, since I think I had driver's ed done by then anyways. But maybe I was too busy. And then Dad wasn't in town that other time we went.   I just don't know what to do at home anymore. Finally tackled some bio today, but I quickly got bored and doubted the effectiveness of my short-term memory by the time the second Monday in May rolls around. But I think some of the physio material is in there, which is nice. Didn't do any history: hit chapter 16, decided to take no notes, and 17 is similarly uneventful. What would I do, though? I have Norah Jones stuck in my head, which is a good sign. I just took Grandma out for errands, when I discovered I wouldn't be driving her car (laughs bitterly). And I want ice cream cake again. I could watch Lost in Translation. Or bad TV. Ah, but this is silly. I've been awake for less than five hours, and I've already run out of things to do.   Best American Essays was satisfying, though. "How old is your son Cello?" And why do I find so many subtle confessions of homosexuality in there? Maybe it's just because I'm sheltered. It's not the first time I've read it. The medical writer is in it again, Atul Gawande, I think. I want to do something like that: practice medicine and write for the New Yorker. Maybe.   Wish me luck. I think I just might be going insane.
