We went to to this brick place and got some brick then we went to nordstrom. Haha. We got to that store WAY to much. Oh my gooodness.   Then we went to the PLASTIC SURGEONS! Hahahhahahhahaha. It was SO sick. They were showing videos of breast agmuntations and I wa slike oh my gosh...this is SO gross. The reason I was going to the plastic surgeons office to get my brothers stiches removed...see, when matt got stiches there was a huge line at the emergency room so they went to Dr. Workmans because he is our friend. One time we were at my grandmas christmas  party and I was watching the news with them and connie chung or whatever was on and he was like "Wow, she just got an eye lift." hahha. It was funny. so he gave my brother stiches for free because my dad gave him an architectual consoltation (wow that was hard to spell!)   So after we got his stiches out we went to the new Bostons Pizza and had dinner. My spanish tutor works there! She is SO cool! I wanna be exactly like her. :) She is moving to mexico soon to be a missionary, isn't that coool?  In a bit the Brands are coming over to watch a movie so that should be interesting. In case you don't know who they are they are from our old church. They have a daughter named Hannah who is my age.  They are cool :)
