   He really didn't do anything for me in Lord of The Rings, as  urlLink Legolas , since I thought he was almost too pretty (in a feminine way) and I'm sure it was because of the hair. Alright, I don't think this is going to turn into anything remotely close to the teeny bop obsession I have with Keanu Reeves...but I just happened to be surfing the internet and came across several Orlando Bloom sites, you know, by accident. It turns out that today is his birthday (he's only 27 years old, if anyone cares).    I didn't realize that he was also in Black Hawk Down. Cool. Anyway, his eyes mesmerize me. Oh, he has sexy hair too.
