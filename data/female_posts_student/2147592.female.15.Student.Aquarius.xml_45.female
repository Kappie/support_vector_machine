Me and Dad did them, I found the Gertrude things (I can't remember what they are called!), they move like snakes...... great fun! And Dad kept asking me for a drawing pin, but they were clearly labelled on the box as thumb tacks  urlLink   . Well we had dinner, my evil family had duck  urlLink   , but I refused and just had the tiddies. After that we continued to do the decorations whilst we listened to the Darkness  urlLink   ! Dude I love that band... Well after that we did the tree while watching the Road to Elda Rado... Dude that was funny... Then I tried decorating the staircase with the cards but my sister was doing my head in so I just gave up, I was about to ahve a nervous breakdown!!! Well I'm on here now, the rest of my plans are to go to Lettys for my presants  urlLink    (just imagine Little Moe's pathetic noise she does when she smiles...) and then I have to go to Midnight Mass. Well I want to wish you all a   urlLink   , take care and have a good one Love you all Podgy Horney Balls xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
