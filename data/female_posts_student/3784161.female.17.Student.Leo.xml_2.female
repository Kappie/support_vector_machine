Anyway so I wrote and he knew it was there whether he ever read it or not i really don't know, but now I wanna progress to my own blog, partially because I forgot how to log in to my old one, but also because while I love him, and miss him, that friendship isn't what it used to be, which, is a good thing, for we both grew to a point of independence that I didn't know I could achieve. Anyway, so I'm here now. These are excerpts from my old entries, things I didn't wanna forget. (be glad I didn't repost the entire journal).    ~~~~~~~~Jan 18~~~~~~~~~~~~  The other day I told Derek I'd love to lean over a cliff, one of those that hangs over the rocky ocean waters of california. I want to lie down on it and hang my head over the edge and scream at the waters until they listen to me. Until they're quiet and I am the presence... with the power of the waves to crush anything against the jagged rocks or pull it away, with the beauty of the sunlight reflected in the waters, to capture any one's heart, and the serenity of the waves steady beating against the shore to comfort anyone who was hurting.    I want to know I'm alive. I want to run screaming naked down the beach, or climb a snow-capped mountain and stand atop it and watch an avalanche somewhere beneath me.  I wanna go dancing, and I wanna flirt with the band until they let me sing lead-- sing the way I sing at home with a good bowl of ice cream and the right music.  I want to tell somebody I love them, in a way they can't help but love me back. I want to die in a storm out at sea, on a sail boat.    The other day, Mandy, only half joking, said she wished that she could have an adventure like in her video games, and books, and anime shows. "Life is so boring" she said. But it isn't. It's just us, we're too stubborn and sure that it has to be a certain way to be good. It's so sad. I hope that no matter what I do, I never forget what it is to feel like this.   ~~~~~~~~~~Jan 19~~~~~~~~~  ...So I tried to unleash the emotion on the piano, and I couldn't play anything right. Not even Eyes On Me. I wanted so badly to scream. It's always been kind of my dream, along with dying in a storm out at sea, I'd like to let down my gaurd long enough just once to throw a real fit, to yell and kick and punch and throw things, breakable things. And then have someone there to catch me when I fall back crying. So many times I feel like doing that, but so far I've been the well reserved, fair mannered child.   I made another list of wishes:   How I wish I could play the drums well. Just sit down and turn up the stereo and let it all out, and be happy again. Or run, throw on the sweats and run for miles until I'm so tired I can't remember what was bothering me. Or drive, drive so fast and far that I get completely lost. I don't want to know where I am anymore.   ~~~~~~~Jan 21~~~~~~~~~  an excerpt from an entry inspired by an old note I found from my very dear friend John:   My Dearest Little Sister,  Sometimes in life we fail to see the happiness that one brings to our life to the fullest extent. Missing the subtle, selfless acts that some people do for everyone's benefit, we foolishly take these people for granted. You are one of those people, Sis. No matter how many times I look into your eyes, I can't help but see a beautiful and loving person inside.   With every smile and hug you give, you brighten another person's day. But we take for granted the fact that you are a very caring person. We take for granted the fact that without you there to brighten our day we would all be lost to fits of depression. We take your love for granted.  ~John~    ...The goodness of John. The innocent naieve lovable John. How could I have let him go ever? How I love him. He is the person described in his letter, Not me...I'm so inspired. By John, by Charlotte, by Ben to better apreciate the people around me. I'm so in awe of Monica to live so openly, so uncautiously. Mandy, the one most taken for granted, most often overlooked. She has a heart that most never see. She's more easily shattered than one might think, oh but she's so strong, for her mother. She'd give her life away so that her mother would be happy -- Selfless. I want to become them.  ~~~~~~~Jan 30~~~~~~~ On nights like these he(Sam) makes me thankful that there are people in the world that don't put themselves first. I always wanna be one of those people, but I'm not.   ~~~~~~~~Feb 05~~~~~~~~~~ My life is a song without Melody. I hate songs without melody. They tend to go on and on building tension or excitement, but never provide a release. My life is a song without melody because I can't prioritize. Familyschoolfriendsmusicmocktrialsyouthlegboyfriendsliteraturereputationsleepeternalquestionsfuturepastpresentverbalvommit. That's the name of my song. I wish I were a cat, with 9 lives. one to screw up with- to learn. a second to be rich with. a third to be dirt poor with. a fourth for law. 5th for psychology. 6th for music. 7th and 8th to love with. The last to teach with.   ~~~~~~~Feb 17~~~~~~~~ Ew. That's my reaction to life right now. It's a gooey green glob. Not even green. At least that's a vibrant color. No, it's grey. It's a murky grey glob. And someone has poked it with a stick.   ~~~~~~~~Feb 26~~~~~~~ How do you fix things like this? I envy John on some levels. Like I told Ben, I wish I believed enough in prayer to think it would help. Or like Tara in fate and Karma. I wish I could believe that everything I did was irrelevent in the divine scheme of things because it's "meant" to be a certain way. But I'm stuck in a world where everything I say or do has consequences. . . And we will get past it but we will not mend . . . I hate that life is real now. It used to be so escapable...  ~~~~~~Mar 13~~~~~~~~~~ I will say this. This mood I am in right now, is only a half truth. It is not completely real. But then again, what is? I have lost respect for someone that I have always admired and I am hurt because of it. Last night, I had a lot to think about, and it consumed me, and reality crushed my naivety. Today I have changed but then when are we not changing? I used to run screaming from the thought, and now I accept it. Change is a part of life. The way in which we apply that change is where its worth is measured. I don't know a lot of things. I don't know what I want out of life, or an after life, or what of any of it is real. But I do know that if I ever stop learning from others, I have become someone that I do not want to be.   ~~~~~~~~~Mar 20~~~~~~~~~~~~ proof of beauty within... tonight was the first time in a very long time that I've felt even remotely at home in the world.
