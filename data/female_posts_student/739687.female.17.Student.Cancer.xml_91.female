No one understands...everyone just jumps every time i make a mistake, and they rub it in my face. I know I'm not perfect. So if one more person tries to make me feel like crap, I'll kick their ass. And I mean it. I don't learn from hatred! No one does you FREAKING IDIOTS! Love truth, but pardon error. So chill. Because I'm close to breaking...and when I hit my breaking point, there's no turning back. That's a warning. Leave me alone, and I'll do the right thing. But if one more person has to be rude to me, I'll do my best to piss everyone off.
