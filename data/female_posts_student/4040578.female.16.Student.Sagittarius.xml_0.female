He should know that I am one tough girl and I leave him with bruises an what not. But it's really fun to show my strength,let some anger out, and I guess it doesn't bother him that much cause he stills visits. Yeah, in case ya didn't know I am the youngest of five. The oldest is John who is 36, Mark died at 24, but would be 34 (I think) , Dustin is 24, and then Leah is 18. So yeah, I have it good being the youngest.      Moving on, today I woke up before 12. What a shocker. Leah woke me up to get in the shower so that I could go run some errands with her. I took my shower and then we were off to Khols. Leah picked some stuff up and I saw some things I liked too. We were at the cash register and we got a $10 reward thing which is good Aug.1- Aug.7, she gave it to me so you better believe I am going back.After that was all done with we came back home and chilled for a bit. I waited for my dad to get home cause we were going to also run some errands. I told my dad about some things at Khols I saw, and I asked if we could go again tonight and then I thought or tomorrow so I could use the reward card. Anywho, we went back to Khols again tonight. So yeah, I got me a punkster purse and a black belt and saw also some even more cutesy stuff. I can't wait til my birthday and Christmas. I already have a list going. But after Khols my dad wanted to go look for some shoes for him. So we went into Finish Line. They had the tightest pink Nike's. I love them. But they are waaaaay over priced. I thought I was starting to run a fever. Well, he didn't find anything he liked there so we walked down to Old Navy. On the way, Bath and Body Works is there so I asked if we could go in to smell some stuff. Just a lil hint: My fav scent for now is Sheer Freesia..hehe. So we went in and I looked at some prices. The chic working there talked my dad into buying some room scenting stuff for my mom and then she put this lotion stuff all over my hands. I was like ok, I didn't really care for the smell. But when I came home my bro and mom were like mmm what's that smell?...so I was like hmmm maybe it's a winner. But I don't know. Well after my dad bought my mom some stuff we left to go into Old Navy. Nothing there that was of any interest so we left to make it back home in time for Big Bro 5. So yeah, that leaves me to sitting here. I did talk to my dad about gettin second holes in my ears,like either right next to the one hole I already have or up higher. Dad didn't seem to not like the idea. So maybe I should just add that to the list. I would like to get my belly button pierced. Mom doesn't like the idea cause she says I don't show my stomach and also hinting I don't need to. O well, at least I know it's there. Anyway, I doubt that will happen.      Ok, well now you learned a bit of the family history and the scent for now at Bath and Body Works. Moving rather fast in getting to know me,eh? Well, the typing is done for the night, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background:  She Will Be Loved-Maroon 5
