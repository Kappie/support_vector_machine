I wasn't ready for public until 4, then Daniel and I sat around for a while and at 4:45 we left to go shopping. Amanda decided to come with us so when Daniel stopped to get a hair cut at TGF cuts, she sat in the car with me waiting. I figured Daniel getting his hair cut would take probably 20 minutes at the most becuase he is a dude and it's a simple cut, I could have done it but he doesn't trust my creative side I have too much fun with things. Anyway so we stopped there and Amanda and I sat in the car for a whole 45 minutes waiting for him to finish. The lady even took him in right away too it's not like he had to wait at all. She was definately taking her time. Anyway, we did that and then we headed to the mall. First we went to PacSun so daniel could exchange a shirt that he changed his mind about. While he was doing that Amanda and I decided we were going to go to Wet Seal. But instead, we went the wrong way to the oppostire side of the mall and ended up at Ally Cat and Mervyns. I bought a really cute black top at Ally Cat and we only went into Mervyns to look at Chucks. They ended up being $40 there so I said definately not. Anyway the we stopped at Nordstrom to look at shoes and I still can't decide what kind I want to buy, I know I need new ones because I am totally stuck on my flip flops. Yeah so then we went to find Daniel and headed the right way to Wet Seal (he knew exactly where it was. why is that I have no idea.) Amanda kept saying that she liked all of the jeckets there better than the $100 jacket I already bought. I think my jacket is the coolest but noone else seems to agree with me. I must have made a mistake, we'll see how poeple look at me once it gets cool enough to actually wear a jacket. Anyway, I didn't buy anything there so we headed to Abercrombie. I bought a polo, two pairs of jeans, and a pair of cute khaki pants. Why they fit me when I went this time I have no idea. I did try on a different style so that must have been it. Dumb me. Once we were all done with that we went to American Eagle, but I was so tired and thirsty that I didn't feel like shopping anymore. Can you believe that? Yea. Tomarrow I have to go back to dad's. Ann is taking him in to get a Cortizone shot in his neck so the swelling goes down, he hurt his neck/shoulder somehow and he's been in a little bit of pain for a while so they are trying to fix it. Ann's kid Jordan, who is 10? is at dad's house with a friend and there are no other adults there so when they leave I have to babysit. Stupid me didn't even ask if I was going to get paid I just said yes. Dad said he has a harness I can work on so that's what I'm going to do all day. Hopefully he will have another one sometime this week becuase I need some more money and I need to get it by the end of this week because swim starts the 23rd and I'm going to have to be at moms from then on so I can go to practice.
