But I think it's going to be amazing. There's a purdy clean Slipknot song I'd like to ask the dudes to do, and of course RATM (Freedom! Yeah right!) and other stuff. I think with one suggestion from all of us we could fill a purdy good set. And I don't think we'd get booted...well, that fast.  And for those of you who didn't know, Stranglebox has become no more. The new advent of that band is called  Choleric , but that one's sort of in the background as well.  So the present band is called  Pariah , an old project of Charlie Carr's and Adam Mauldin's that I happened to get asked into after that wonderful round of  Love Shack  in Arizona (Adam saw it and cried). And as of right now, Nick B. is in as well. It's going to SO ROCK IT HARDCORE STRAIGHT UP! Tell all your friends, Pariah ate your mother! Or something disturbing enough to grab attention just like that.  A happy rainy day and long weekend to all.
