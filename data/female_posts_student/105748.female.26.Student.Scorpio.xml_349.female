Plus, we all do not blog so regularly. People on SMEAGHE go on hiatus and people on WEB CLOGGERS go on hiatus and there will be weeks with no message postings at all.. With just one blog, the gaps will be less frequent. Old  SMEAGHE Today  and  WEB CLOGGERS  posts will be available for as long as GeoCities wants to keep them open.
