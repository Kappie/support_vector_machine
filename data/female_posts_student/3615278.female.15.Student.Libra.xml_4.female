Everyone makes mistakes ain't it? no doubt they haveexperience and have seen more stuffs than us, but we are not totally a fool. I wanna make my own decisions, wanna fight for my own rights. But somehow, this will seem rebellious in thier eyes. This is so absurd. I wanna live my own life. Why must i live up to their unreachable expectations? i know what i want... I'm not going to live under their pressure and opinions... i wanna break through. To live the life i want, to be the girl i wanna be. To love and to be love by someone who respects my decision.   ~Jace~
