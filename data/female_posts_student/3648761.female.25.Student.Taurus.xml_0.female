I stood in line for like 10 minutes with two brown grocery bags full of food for donations.  There are like 5 old lady's that didn't even notices and told me to go ahead and grab like sandwiches or something. I didn't catch it because I started laughing at her. I said," NO, NO, I am hear to donate this food that I am holding" "Ohhhh"" She says, "I didn't notice". How could you not notice.  It was funny.    So today, I got some really great news my friend Christine. She is coming from Florida to visit. She said she is coming to stay with me. I love having her around. I really miss her.  She is bringing her new beau. I love that girl to death, but she has the worst taste in men.  (no offense Chris) So this guy aught to be interesting.  Watched my new favorite show, quintuplet, on Fox. That show is hilarious, my favorite character is played by  urlLink Ryan Pinkston , The kid from punked and soul plane, that kid just steals the show.   Tomorrow, is my hard work out day from that crazy instructor at West Wood. I've been working out everyday this week at west Wood, and lifting some weights, so I won't be so sore this time. Well wish me luck I have to wake up before nine tomorrow. Ouch!
