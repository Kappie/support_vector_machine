Why!?! Why of all the things i wrote about, why did they choose fav books!?! Its cruel! There are much better things to talk about than fav books! Music for one! Grr! I just dont get it! Well i give up tryin to get ye ol' bloggy to make see sense... im off to, erm... spend 10 mins doin sumat... then im off to watch the fast show.
