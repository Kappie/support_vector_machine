We were hanging out at her house and when it was time to go home she pulled her car out of the garage and smashed into her Mom's car.  Her Mom's car just had a little scratch but Kel's car is scrunched in the back with big scratches.  All in all, its not that bad, but you know how traumatizing a first fender bender can be. Her mom took it pretty well considering but their insurance is going to go up now. Poor Kelly, she was crying and we were all trying to make conversation to keep the mood light, but it wasn't really working.  Finally I just tried to be quiet, knowing that nothing I could say would make her feel any better. I gave her hug and told her I loved her when I left.  I know there are much much worse things in this world, but its hard to keep that in mind when something happens to you--and I feel Kel's pain. (I got pulled over 2 weeks after I had failed my drivers test for not stopping completely on right on red.  I almost hit the cop car, can't understand what he was so upset about)  I think we were both wondering why stuff like this always seems to happen to people who don't deserve it.  As much as I hate to admit it, the answer is that there really is no answer.  There is no higher reason for why Kelly had to hit her Mom's car tonight.    I hope the girl feels better, since she doesn't read this, I'm just going to ESP her a message. FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, WE LOVE YOU KELLY!!!!!!!!!
