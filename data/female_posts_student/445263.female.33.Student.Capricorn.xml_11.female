Bugger, So I've decided to start from scratch, and include the remnants of my old website (all fiendishly out of date and will be changed when I get round to it!) and some new things (well, what I'm reading and listening to and a couple of links) and I promise I'll try and update this ... but then, I always do say that. *sigh* We'll see!
