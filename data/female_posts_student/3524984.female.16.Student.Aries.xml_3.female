Yesterday...I woke up at around noon...had a glass of water...then at around three...I had a glass of grape juice...at five...everyone was having supper so, I joined in like a huge pig...and had a salad...ugh! I went to bed at around 1:00AM. One of my aunts who is close to my "new" family came over for supper..so I really had to force myself to eat...though, the feeling of food being stuffed in your mouth, isn't really a desired one...well anyway..about that aunt of mine...can anybody say -huge-son-of-a-bitch- 10 times real fast?! She was talking to my erm "dad" since my "mum" is nowhere to be found...[though she did call me and tell me that everything was alright, and that - no she wasn't coming back...ok. I'm heart broken...and it sucks to know that you miss your own replacement mom...I'm not supossed to hate her?! Oh well...she was there for me and I am thankful for everything she and "dad" have done.] UGH! I keep going back to another subject... *coughs*becauseIdontWantToTalkAboutIT*coughs* Anyway, she was like "Tim, dear. You have to watch that freak show, you know shes going to be 6 feet under if you dont watch her...Just like that mother of hers! She calls herself a mother, she was clearly knocked up with her first child, what was it again..Michael his name was...where is he anyway Tim?! Dont tell me you dont know!" I was in such a rage, that I got up from the table, jai toute sacré on the floor and I was just fed up of her and her antics...she cant go spread bullshit somewhere else but here!? The wacko...shes such a dumbass!! Dont ask, just dont...*cries* WTF am I doing... Ugh, I called nat today...only too find out she was gone to Montreal for the week. too bad, I'm not headed there for about another couple of days. By the time I get there, she'll be back here...meh. whatever...I need someone too talk to...and, well...apart from Dee or Billy...All I have friends I've met online...But - I would only talk to one of them...and thats only if THEY started the convo...I dont want to have some kind of pity party going on..It's just the guy, he understands so much...I dont know...I just, like him alot..My dad wont stop it with the phone calls..he always says the same thing "I never meant to hit you Em. You know you're an amazing person...blah blah blah..."then the moment came..he said IT..."im sorry"...this was the perfect moment to show him how much I really didn't care and that he had lost me forever...I just said..."If only sorry could heal all the scars...If only you hadn't hit me all those times...If only..." and I hung up...and I cried for awhile...I just wanted a normal family..for once..just for once..try to see what its like...I called BELL© Telephone a little later and blocked his cell phone number...his home phone..everything... SHAY- RIP JENN & DAVID...J'vous Aiment!
