Soo I decided to write in my blog since I havn't done it in what- 10 days?.  Anyways this is gonna be one of those kinda pointless but very intresting posts, since of course, everything in my blog is so very intresting! Well school is just fabulous. I have to pass off a peice of music which by the way i can't play- oh and english is the perfect time to catch up on missed sleep! hahah! The great thing is I sit on the front row and sleep and mrs. Lashley doesn't even care! Care class- woo woo- character and realationship education (sex ed) man thats a weird class! Hmm I wanna go somewhere cuz im hyper but i guess i can't seeing as its 10:30 at night and i can't drive. I'm very random tonight. I want some glasses. I have contacts but i think i want some small glasses i can wear in public so i look sophisticated! Ohh a few days ago in biology we had this really hard question for extra credit on our test and since it was an honors class i didn't figure i'd have a chance at it anyways so i just kinda started writing things down, but then it started makin sense and i got it right. Haha i think i made everyone feel stupid cuz the "dumb kid" got it! hahah it was great. I was so proud of myself! Ugg im soo hyper and theres nothing to do and no where to go!!! *sigh* I think i needa boy friend... I'm kinda tired of being single. But the problem is i havn't found anybody to like that i know likes me, and i gotta know they like me cuz i don't like takin chances on people. I'm so difficult. Wow it was kinda cold today! But thats ok i like it cold cuz i like to sleep under 3 or 4 blankets at night! I'm soo weird- haha o well its more fun that way! Popular people are so much fun to make fun of! Cuz they r so worried about lookin good and hanging out with the most popular people when in high school it doesn't really matter as long as u have a group to be with! Well those are my sophisticated thoughts of the night since I think im coming down off of my hyper- high!
