We've seen each and every one in that series:  Clerks ,  Mall Rats ,  Chasing Amy  and  Dogma . It all kind of ties in with various references in the movie. I even got Brian the comic book,  Chasing Dogma , that tells how Silent Bob and Jay got from where they were in  Chasing Amy  to the spot where they just happened to be in  Dogma .     Charlie's Angels  was really goofy. One shouldn't take it seriously.. A lot of people who do, end up thinking it's retarded.. It was meant to be a funny movie (to me, anyhow). I thought it was funny !  One of my favorite parts is the dream dance sequence. I'm really into dancing movies:  Save the Last Dance ,  Dance With Me , etc. I loved that dress !  I actually got myself some underoos(I can't wear them now because they shrank), just because they looked cute on Cameron Diaz !  You all know how impressionable I am !     I want the URL to get to  your  section of opendiary !!!  Come on, Glee !
