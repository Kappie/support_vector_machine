The hairdresser because he says, "Do you want it teased or blown?"   The Milkman because he says, "Do you want it in front or in back?"   The Interior Decorator because he says, "Once you have it all in, you'll love it."   The Banker because he says, "If you take it out too soon, you'll lose interest."   The Police Officer because he says, "Spread 'em."   The Mailman because he always delivers his package.   The Pilot because he takes off fast and then slows down.   The Hunter because he always goes deep in the bush, shoots twice and always eats what he shoots.
