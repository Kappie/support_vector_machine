Not done much as i have been stuck inside, i had a food fight whilst making chocolate muffins that was fun. Tomorrow i am meeting the pais worker who is going to be based at my church from september. If you are not surewhat a pais worker is they area a sort of youth worker, they go into schools and do assemblys and things, but they are also based at churches at the area in which they are working. We are getting a lad called lee from N. Ireland which hould be good although we might scare him as we are all quite mad at our church. It will also be quite confusing as we have someone called lee at our church already but we will get round thta be giving them nicknames. Anyway not got much else to say God Bless Katie
