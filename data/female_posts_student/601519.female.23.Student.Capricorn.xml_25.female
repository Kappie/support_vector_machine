 So now I'm sleepy, sleepy. 

 Sleepy. 

 Oh and I'm suffering my first day of period. I always feel like my body is being corroded by acid and is about to fall apart into two pieces, on my first day of period. 

 So add that to sleepy. 

 Actually, I guess it's a blessing I'm sleepy then. Makes the pain not so bad, since I'm more desiring of sleep than for pain to stop....
