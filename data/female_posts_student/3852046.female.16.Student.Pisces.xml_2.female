On a happier note I showed my poem about bill to some of the teachers at school and they liked it. Older people appreciate my work more.:-) The counselor( to whom I am good mates with) wants to publish and laminate it. I have had many of my poems published in a book in America.  I spoke to Ed ( an awesome friend of mine), he wasn't ina very talkitive mood as he has been soooooooooooooooo busy with some computer stuff. It is wierd i havent spoken to him on the phone all week except just then. :-o that is kinda scary, but good because I am not obsessed with him.lol. I still want to hit verity because she is still making fun of Ed and I GRRRRR, I hate it wen people make fun of my friends especially ones that I know have beent hrough a lot. well I guess that is it, I will leave you and go adn eat as I am starving.:-s  Peace Out
