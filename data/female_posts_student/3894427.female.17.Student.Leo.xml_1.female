In a matter of 4 days we saw everything, probably more than the average rushed New Yorker has noticed.            I'll have to admit the Broadway shows we're amazing and even more awe-inspiring than the hometown plays I grew up gazing at and dreaming(obviously).Ground Zero was ...unexplainable. I realize that I, of all people, shouldn't feel as deeply swelled with the sadness and hurt as any New Yorker but as most know it's much more than that. Other aspects were awesome, Lady Liberty, Wall Street, even the NBC Studios in which we toured the SNL set and the Conan O'Brien (oh yeah, Macy's...Times Square...many Starbucks, in which we went into as many as we could, that was great).      All in all, the zenith (rarely used word, but hey I just learned what it meant like a week ago and in order to successfully place it in ones vocabulary, one must practice) of my whole NYC experience was summed up on our last day there.  The United Nations. I never realized I would be one to go into international relations and so forth...but something so great on a young persons mind is just unstoppable.  I don't know what caught my eye so much about the UN. Maybe it was the simpleness of "We are the peacekeepers" when it was said by our guide. A place where all cultures are accepted and a place where fair and not unrulyness of politics can take over. No bribes of money, oil, land can change much of anyones ways...it seems so fair.     Along with all that running around the city, we had some odd things happen,too.  We left a lady ,in our tour group, at one of the sites for 2 hours without even noticing she wasn't on the bus or with us..ha! Man..we felt so bad though. We saw a guy get busted by the cops, I wanted to film it, but my battery was dead!
