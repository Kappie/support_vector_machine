Plus i get to meet her new boyfriend. Other then that there is nothing new. I get to relax all weekend. I have no major projects or essays to do. I have a oral french exam and a written one next week. I have 3 more days until school is over. Wish me luck for the exams. On Monday i will have something interesting to talk about. I have to get to class. Have a great weekend.
