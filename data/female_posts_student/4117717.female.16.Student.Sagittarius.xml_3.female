And I got sad while mowing the lawn cause they were talking about the Warped Tour on the radio and dude...it sounds even better now. Meh, oh well.  Um after that I watched the ever so exciting Maury. The fat babies episodes are the best. Hah, they are just so fat! I feel terrible for them, cause their parents are just stuffing their faces. There was this one baby just walking around and would sit with the audience and took Maury's mic and just scream into it and run in front of the camera. He was quite the entertainment. And of course like everyone else I decided to make cookies while watching the fat babies! Don't worry, they were oatmeal. I like oatmeal cookies. Infact, I belive I should go have one.....  Um after that I didn't do anything. Took a nap. Checked the no new emails. And now I get to go and mow the back lawn, cause I am doing that and avoiding practicing driving tonight. I've been driving with my parents for at least an hour every singal night and I'm quite tired. I just need this one day break. ..the break to mow the lawn. Sigh.   Um......that is all, I suppose...
