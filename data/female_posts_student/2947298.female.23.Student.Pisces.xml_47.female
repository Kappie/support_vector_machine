No we do not need other peoples materialistic support, we need emotional support. So what a man can not support you financially, he can still be there for you emotionally and hopefully intellectually.    Personal:    So where have I been? Got my G4 finally with some difficulty. The apple loan place was being a pain in my you know what. But I recieved it finally. I am not online because our home wireless router is acting all bitchy and not sending any connections out sometimes even to the computer that is directly connected. So I have to call about three different tech supports every day and well....   But my computer is totally cool! It works just great and cost a great amount. Oh well you win some you loose some.   Going to see Ross today and then to the shore to chill with Crystal on her B-Day, all via train of course. I just hate shore traffic.   I've been taking a Environmental History course and have been quite busy with it. Every Wed we go on a field trip some place. Last week was Torne Valley's superfund site. Mind you that does not say super fun. It was hot and the wind picked up just right for all of us to wif the lovley smells. And oh the toxic waste. It really makes you realize you're killing this world and at the same time urself. Most of our other trips are lovely walks in parks and such. Which reminds me I have an extra credit and midterm to do! Opps!   Work has also been keeping me mad busy. I get home at the end of the day and want to kill every apple I see. But I do get paid, and I do enjoy the people I work with.   The garden Ross and I have is going great. We have a billion acorn squashes and some strawberries and bellpeppers. I call Ross Thoreau, he likes that.   Speaking of Ross got me a full box portable easel. I think it's great how I get support from him and my friends and family for my art work. I am still finding my artistic nitche but atleast I have people around me encouraging me.   I am all set for outter banks now andcan't wait for the beach! I might go to our Florida house soon but that has yet to be seen.... anyone up for roadtripping with me?   Well I feel I'm spending to much time indoors on this sunny day so I am going out!
