I'm tired of winter boots.  Busy week coming.  Last colloquium of the year on Tuesday.  Glad for that.  I like the talks but I hate the social aspect of the gathering.  Maybe it would help if I could get sloshed on wine like other folks there.  Wednesday I start grading some 50 essays.  Thursday, a chat scheduled that I'm not terribly keen on.  Saturday, a retreat if I'm far enough ahead in my work to permit myself a retreat from the real world for four hours.  Going to try to do a French manicure at home.    More to come...
