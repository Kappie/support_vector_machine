Opps, at least we got through like 3 or 4 levels. :-) I am confused, I think that Mike likes me but I am not all sure.  I am such an idiot though... so, I don't know.  He just never seems like he wants to see me.  It may just be because of finals or because school is getting out.  I don't know, but I would like to know where this is going.  Cause right now I am soo friggin (haha I said friggin) confused.  We flirt constintly (spelling) and we have kissed and stuff, but he is always doing something to where he has to leave early or whatnot.  I think that I just got unlucky cause last weekend he had some family in town that he hasn't seen in like forever and this week is finals.  So, maybe everything will get better soon.  At least I hope.
