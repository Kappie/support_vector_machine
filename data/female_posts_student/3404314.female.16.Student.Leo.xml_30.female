"my loneliness is killing me.." and that's what makes me sad.. i have no one to talk to, no one to share gossips with.. no one to eat with.. haii!! that's why my friends usually come over whenenever im alone because being alone feels deppressing or me.. but sometimes being alone feels good coz i learn to face everything alone..sometimes!! and when we are together we pig out, we sing along with our videoke, we surf the internet, and the usual chismisan!! oh my, how i miss that!!   my cousins started school last tuesday, so im left alone with thalia!!
