I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, "Oh man..." Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said "Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing" And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...  Oh well, me go have dinner liao...  Laters!!
