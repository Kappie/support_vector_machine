Although I was very saddened by the news of his death I was also relieved that I didn’t have to go into work today. I feel sort of selfish in saying this, but it gave me the chance to be a part of something wonderful in my eyes, my Oldest Nephew Jacob (6 years) graduation from kindergarten. It was the cutest thing to have ever gotten a chance to witness. The kids sang two songs, “America the Beautiful” and “I believe I can Fly”. They sung their little hearts out. Then we got to see all of the kids receive their certificates of completion for their first year of elementary school.   I also volunteered my time to do body stamping for the children in all of the kindergarten classes at his school (don’t worry that’s just two classes). It was so fun to be around all of this positive energy and the experience did loads of wonder for my stress levels, I was actually able to think clearly and enjoy my day without having to worry about my friends and their issues (no offense but I know that is what friends are there for, but sometimes you just need a break from the drama). After about 40+ kids, all painted and happy, they decided it was my turn and proceeded to color my arms and legs. It was an awesome sight to see. I was readily open to allow these little Picasso’s to use my arms and legs as their canvases but after a while they wanted to move from my arms and legs to my face. Now I am not too picky about my arms and legs, but I do have to draw a line when it comes to my face. But lets just say, once the children were done with their tiny masterpieces I wore them proudly and brushed off the faces of disapproval from the visiting parents because the artist became the art and I was displaying several tiny pieces of art drawn by wonderful 5  6 year olds.  So without further ado I present to you Canvas a’la Danielle!!!  Please be pacient, there are five images that are going to be loading           Kids are just so awesome to be around!  I so needed today.
