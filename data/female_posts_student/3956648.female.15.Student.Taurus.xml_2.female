So you sit there and cry and wish that what just happened to you wasn’t true.  You shake and you shiver on the mattress on the floor.  And then when he’s next to you, you shake and you shiver even more.  And then when he gets close to you and he tells you to spread your legs you can’t help to scream and move all around.  And the thought of running away runs through your head over and over again but you realize that it is to late now because he already has you pinned to the ground.     You hear people say that the worst part of being raped is the pain and bad memories but that is not all true.   What hurts the most is that your parents always send you this vibe that they will always protect you but yet they let this man rape and hurt you.  Not only that but when you came home that same night your parents don’t even notice that anything’s wrong.  So for the rest ofmy life untilI tell themI have to act like that never happened and Ihave to be strong.   By Kristine Pietsch
