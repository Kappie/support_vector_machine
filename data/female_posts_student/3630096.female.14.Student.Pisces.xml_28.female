Many said we won't survive, but we did. it was a miracle we had achieved. This very special day... Enough about independence day, let's get on with life. I woke up early in the morning, a little bit stuffy. Bro always said that my room is always so stuffy and anyone who stays in this room for a day will surely get sick or something...haha. So woke up and wash up and then plan the day... Firstly, make the dough for the pizza!! heh heh. Then go Bukit Panjang Plaza buy my bag then go home lorz...and then sleep! Bake the pizza, eat, sleep, another day gone. Simple eh!? So wake up, drink juice then after two hours planned time, then go plaza! OMG. Mum took so long time...So took lrt and a very long walk, wait for the traffic then go window shopping, see the bags...Then stop at Ice Lemon Tee and bought a bag almost exactly the same to huiqian! bet she'll slaughter me on wednesday...*oops* haiz... went to buy mos burger..wait for 20min and shop ar shop..heheh. NICE! Very nice. Then go home, sleep, wake up, watch the ndp parade and eat pizza then enter the blog for the day... Quite well for me, dun you think?
