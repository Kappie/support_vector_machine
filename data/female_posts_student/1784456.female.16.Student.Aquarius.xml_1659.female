So being the good student like I am, I've spent the whole day drooling as I watched Gravitation, and then downloaded some of it for good measure. *ahh it's like she's talking code!* Hehe Shuichui's sooo manic! Waaahaaa Pika Kumagarooo! I love people who are free to be manic! It's too boring keeping it inside yourself, that's why when some one tells you to get up and dance, you don't just dance, you sing too.
