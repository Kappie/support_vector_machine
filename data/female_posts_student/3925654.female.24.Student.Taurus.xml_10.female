It was our second attempt to create these luscious cheese-filled pockets of pasta, into which we placed one basil leaf each (or none or 2) for aesthetic appeal.    We discovered that rolling out pasta is quite difficult without a pasta machine. Even the crank version (one of which we have at home and another of which I gave Baker as a present a while back) renders the dough much thinner in much less time. As a result, our hand-rolled ravioli was a little tough.    Still, it was fun to make and fun to eat. If only makingdelicious foodlike this from scratch weren't so exhausting...
