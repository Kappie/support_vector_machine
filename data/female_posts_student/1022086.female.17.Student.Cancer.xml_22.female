Honestly, since school has started, everything has been going downhill. Things I had thought I'd put behind me are resurfacing, my classes are hideously intolerable, and not too much is going right, quite frankly. I've been trying to overlook everything and stay positive, but do you notice that overlooking everything is really hard? So, I'm sitting in calculus attempting to complete an assignment as my boisterous class's members converse exuberantly about nothing with one another, and it hits me:   Mental incarceration is predominant. I'm sitting here, having failed an overly easy homework for unbelievably stupid inattentive mistakes, feeling like slime and wanting to simply vanish because of my approximate geography. I feel tied by everything- my clothing (cold weather is innverving), my classes, the supposed humans surrounding me--the folks near me particularly, throwing me odd looks as I exist, as I breathe, as I'm myself. I wish I had an invisibility cloak right here, right now, and could take my leave.    *Sigh* In all eventuality, I'll become accostumed to my situation and learn how to deal with it, I hope. Things could be about a gazillion times worse, but I can't refrain from detesting the high school world. If it would only end at home... Nothing is wrong, but everything is unbelievably passive, in that cool way that feels almost worse than the heat of a combustion reaction within the boundaries of the home, most likely caused by a heated argument that's happened between my sister and I or my mother and I or perhaps not even involving me.   I don't know whether what I'm experiencing is anger. Anger can be a beautiful thing, as long as it is not utilized as an excuse for destruction. I'm not claiming it that way.                                Have I mentioned that I want to scream at the very top of my lungs?     I think I need a cafe mocha.   And some Bob Marley                                      as I calm down and begin my stupid                                              homework.   And perhaps post a lousy poem of mine.       To Myself  They said to me,  “Little girl, you have a long,  	long way to go.” I said,  “Indeed, my friends, I have a long,  	long way to go.”  “But you’re clever; you’ll excel in many areas,” 		they said. “Oh, but I don’t know,  for you never can tell,” said I.  So is this an egotistical attempt,       a narcissistic disposition to          write a poem to myself,                 for my eyes only,                       to remind myself                           that life is life?                                        Supposedly not,                                   but then, it could be,                            for I could be writing to          somebody else, or about somebody      else- as opposed to writing illogically all over this college ruled morceau de papier                        pezzo di carta                        pedazo de papel-however you say it!             pretending to be a poet.
