Anyway Hannah, on the subject of Looney people, I have a few to add to the list. Some of them are classics like the  Freaky Paris Man  who tried to get in our photograph (and grope my arse), and the  Growling Man  on the bus some years ago. Also Nicola might remember the man who preached to us on the number 4 bus about the Bible all the way from Birmingham to our stop. Lastly there is  Weird Adam  who regularly send texts about how God loves me, and wears white jeans, and crocodile shoes, and reminds of an elf crossed with a line-dancer even though he doesn't really look like either. I will let you know if I think of any more. Until then, happy revising!!!
