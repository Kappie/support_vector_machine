Is it my face I must disguise? Just kill me now And kill me fast This mirror image must be my last Mirror Mirror help me please Cure me of this sick disease Take away the pain inside Somehow make my looks subside So one day the mirror wont brake I will be pretty when I awake Just make it end Make it stop Its the world I want to be ontop Mirror mirror ill go away And because you cant help, I wont stay The beauty is within, and I know that now I will prove it, but I dont know how. So Mirror Mirror on the wall Its time for you to take your fall Ill smash you up to bits and pieces And then its time, that my confidence increases.
