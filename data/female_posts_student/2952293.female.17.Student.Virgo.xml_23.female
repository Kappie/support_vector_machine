I said that Trisha had spread this rumor, when in reality, I had only HEARD that she did this. That was my mistake and I shouldn't have posted that without it being clear that she may not have said that, someone told me that. I really was just laughing at Blaire's reaction, and I completely looked past what I had actually said. I apologize to this person, though they don't like me anyways. Thank you and goodbye.
