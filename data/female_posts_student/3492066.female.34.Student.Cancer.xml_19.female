I don’t know if I still have the picture, or if I put it back in the family collection. I’ll have to check, and indeed in checking I find that I have it not. I don’t have many of the old photos come to think of it. I have one of my great-grandparent’s Noonan, my mother’s mother’s parents, and a photo of my grandmother Bergmann in her heyday of young-womanhood in my daily planner.  As I organize the letters into date order, I’m struck at how cutsey some of them are. A conversation in writing, my grandfather even notes how in love he is with my grandmother. I have to admit, I wonder if I’ve inherited some of this as that Lloyd and I can be cutely-affectionate towards each other, a kind of loving play.   I’m also finding bits and bobs of other things, a page torn from the Friday, August 13, 1943 Examiner covered with want ads (help wanted – woman and girls 18-45, Help wanted Men age 38-50 for example.   Also among things, I have found what looks to be a pen-pal letter to my grandmother from a Pfc. Everett Heacock based at the Army Air Forces Technical School a the Lincoln Air Base in Lincoln, Nebraska.   There’s even a little insert on the war by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company.   I also found an unopened letter from a Pfc. Harry Kowalksi based out of the U.S.M.C. Air Base in Mojave, California, dated July 9 1943  There’s a hand-written note in pencil given to my grandmother calling her “babe,” but I’m confounded as to who it is. Although no name is given, the author mentions that he’s the “guy” to get her to my grandfather. Interestingly enough, this person strikes me both as a Roman Catholic, as well as someone who knows my grandmother’s parents since they mentions “pray just a little harder also for the sinner you have for a mother.”   An added note here...I found another letter addressed to “Dearest Baby  Ernie” written in the same hand. Reading it, everything points to my great-grandfather Noonan, my grandmother’s father.   One more added note...I found yet a third letter in the same hand addressed to “Baby,” it’s signed “From Mother” which would mean that it was from Genevieve Noonan.
