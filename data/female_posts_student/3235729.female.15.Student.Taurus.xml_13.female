I went to school today with an Uzi. There's this kid, he teased me so I shot him in the face. All the world's light won't ease my pain. It won't cease, I'm diseased. Won't you hang me please?   -Distiller's "Sick of it All" hehe...18 days...=D    Ok, so school today...rocked. I didn't go in the morning because I needed to know how I would walk without snapping my foot in 8 places, then in 4th I sat there and bitched with Ms. Clark in between talking to Braun, Ashley, Chazlyn and Candace, then...I skipped 5th went into the gym and talked to Braun and the creatures that go along with her. Then I had drivers. And we never do anything but write notes and watch movies. So I just sat there talking to whoever was around. I'm surprised Mr. B didn't kick me out for skipping.  And then after supper my dad and I went to look for a cell phone. I found the tinyest one ever. It's so LITTLE! It's like a Samsung thinger...Iunno...Cost $200 but hey it's not my money! Now, I'm not saying I'm spending all my dad's monAy....the clerk at Rogers Communications is!!!! (My birthday's in 7 days...May 14)  Anywho I'ma bail...I've not nothing else to say...   -Joebie
