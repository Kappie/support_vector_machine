I hung out with B twice today and saw him at Starbucks when I was heading into A2 to get tickets to Rocky Horror Picture Show. Joce and I went together... We're lesbian, virgin, video sluts.   While in A2, by myself (because I'm anti-social like that), I headed straight to the theatre to pick up tickets, then went to borders and ran into Meg, my poetry club director, on my way to the parking structure. I need to start writing more.  I'm still waiting to hear from you. Do you usually fuck people over and then never talk to them ever again? Because I hate mind games and if you try to pull something with me (which I've been beginning to doubt less and less) I will make something hell for you... I promise. And at the same time that I'm thinking about all of that I just remember everyone who's basically done that to me and realize how many people I've been fake to or haven't contacted for the longest time. I can be a bitch sometimes, I'm sorry. :-/  MOVING ON: So tonight was definately great. Didn't want to have to go back to State Street to see the place I fucked up and should have turned around from the first time my insincts came into play. I don't regret what I've done, I meerly regret the surrounding influences.   AGAIN, MOVING ON: Made it from B's to my house and then Michelle showed up and we left for Rocky Horror. It was better than I expected to tell you the truth. I would have paid more to get into the place but for a night of good "clean" fun it was great. What does a cub scout have to do to become a boy scout? I don't know, maybe you can answer that one for my Joce. ;-)  You and your twinkies. "I bit it because he said he was going to vote for Bush, what a tool." The guy left anyway... pussy.  Looks like Saturday will be spent cleaning the garage in the early morning, heading to B's house for some home cookin' (mmm... brownies), and then I'll probably end up on Joce's doorstep pleeing for a friend to talk to and a place to smoke my cigarettes. I'm going to die.   Shit... it's almost 4am. I need to get some rest, I think I'm starting to pass out.  I'm such a pussy. I can handle this... I think.
