The beginning was way better than the end. It's gone from good and keeps dropping down into lousy gradually.  Tomorrow I'm going to go to town with my mom (how country is that? "going into town") hopefully hopefully to get a CD tower.  I need at the very very LEAST one that'll hold 50 CDs. Hopefully I can find one...think I could find one at Radio Shack?
