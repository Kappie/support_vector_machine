Thankfully, though, my piano lesson is cancelled without me having to plead maladie. lol. Not so great is that this means I have to go to piano on Thursday.   Not that I don't like piano! I love it. And I love my teacher, too, he's the best lol. But I'm just a lazy bum and I hate having to leave my beloved computer and T.V. and food to find out about how I'm not doing my technique very well :p I mean, once I leave the lesson, I'm always happy and in a good mood; but up to and until then, I'm rather miserable.   Anyways, speaking of my computer (not that we were), I'm going to play the Sims. Because that's a damn fun game and I like ruling other people's lives. hehehe..
