I didn't think these feelings were capable from me at all.  All of my fears of commitment are gone.  Here is an excerpt of when I was talkin to my friend Sabina (who's in Japan right now...awesome :) )  (oh i was talkin about how i thought ashley liked him and stuff, so if there's a her or she mentioned, it's about her)  TweetaPopAruga (10:09:58 PM): oh god, let me tell u tho, my world of guys isn't all over with the soap operaness nowt hat i've decided on jacob...i think my best friend likes him TweetaPopAruga (10:10:14 PM): and she's all lyin to him, tryin to impress him and stuff TweetaPopAruga (10:10:27 PM): he was askin me if some of it was true yesterday, it's the dumbest thing lol TweetaPopAruga (10:10:42 PM): but she don't know he knwos she's lyin to him and he's just sittin there "u dumbass, stop it" lol xbebe0601x (10:11:19 PM): OMG wellllll xbebe0601x (10:11:24 PM): so now what? TweetaPopAruga (10:12:49 PM): so now all i can do is trust that he won't go for her if she tries anything (i don't trust that she wont..i wish i could say that she wouldn't but i know her better than that) but i think he knows that he has it good with me, i don't think he'll fuck it up xbebe0601x (10:13:26 PM): good TweetaPopAruga (10:13:32 PM): but they talk online a lot, cuz of ME...he wanted her sn to ask her questions about me and i gave in after lots of begging, and i figured they'd stop after he was done with his questions, but they keep talkin  xbebe0601x (10:13:54 PM): did you tell her you dont appreciate it? TweetaPopAruga (10:15:13 PM): well she won't just openly admit that she's doin it, but everybody knows she is, but she just won't tell me ( i guess hse's tryin to be a "good" friend) so hte only way i've really gotten to confront her without lookin like a bitch is by sort of jokin (with a serious undertone) about it and just lettin her know how much he means to me xbebe0601x (10:18:17 PM): dam do it TweetaPopAruga (10:18:32 PM): i'm so mad tho  TweetaPopAruga (10:18:33 PM): seriously TweetaPopAruga (10:19:24 PM): adn the thing that i hate is that if anytihng did happen between them, it'd be because he had this false vision of her from all the lies she tells him, she's one of those that molds herself to look like the person that who she's talkin to would be impressed with xbebe0601x (10:19:56 PM): wgat a butch she is TweetaPopAruga (10:20:05 PM): me and my other really close friend (we're kind of a little group right now, we all work togethre) but we were talkin about her and how she doesn't seem to even have her own identity anymore-she changes who she is with EVERYBODY TweetaPopAruga (10:20:11 PM): i dont' think she even knows anymore tho xbebe0601x (10:20:56 PM): sad TweetaPopAruga (10:21:18 PM): yep xbebe0601x (10:23:57 PM): sirry the computer sucks xbebe0601x (10:24:08 PM): so does the mouse xbebe0601x (10:24:19 PM): o on though TweetaPopAruga (10:24:44 PM): i'm tryin to figure out...o on? TweetaPopAruga (10:24:50 PM): ohhh go on? xbebe0601x (10:25:41 PM): yes xbebe0601x (10:26:04 PM): how is the birth control thing oigng? TweetaPopAruga (10:26:07 PM): i'm done talkin about that i guess, i talk about it too much and i feel mad and then i get this fear of losin him and i actually wanna cry...i think all my fears of commitment are gone...completely GONE, i think about this guy ALL the time, when i'm awake/when i'm asleep/when i eat, just ALL the time, it's kind of scary, but a good scary  Really the most important ones are my long things that I said..the part about crying...I've never really wanted to cry at the thought of losing anybody, not like this.  I just am so not ready to lose him yet and that thought scares the hell out of me.  I was talkin to Ashley about that and she just kept tellin me I had nothing to worry about.  She might be doin what that age old proverb or whatever says tho, keep ur friends close and ur enemies even closer.  Who knows tho, I mean, whatever happens happens.  I can't stress over it, all I can do is prepare myself for it.    I really can't stop thinkin about him tho, it's sort of drivin me crazy.  But in a REALLY REALLY good way.  This mornin I woke up at like 6:30 thinkin about him and it took like an hour to get back to sleep.  I just wanna see him all the time tho..THAT is scary.  I mean, I would love to see him a lot, but I dont' know what he would think about that.  I worry about that so much.  I don't want him to get tired of me or something.    OK, something other than Jacob to talk about...work is starting to suck more and more.  Today went by so SO SOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow.  Yeah, that's all I can say there lol.   Oh yeah, I signed up for classes at VWCC Monday, and I got all the ones that I wanted. :) yay!!  And I guess that's it for now.  Long entry again!  I guess that's what this is here for tho, just to get all my thoughts and worries out and be there for nosey people to read, altho I haven't gave anybody the website to get here.  If Jacob ever doubts how I feel about him, I should give him this address.  lol, he was asking for it last night but OF COURSE I told him he couldnt' have it.  Of course, with that wonderful spyware that I have no idea where it came from, who knows who knows what I write in here.  Oh well.  It's their own fault if they don't wanna know it.  And oh well if they tell anybody what's in here.  Not too much interesting I don't guess, depends on who u r.
