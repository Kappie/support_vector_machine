The tortoise is much bigger than those two tortoise which I use to have that died because I didn't give them enough food. I am happy to have another pet, but also afraid that I can't take care of him. Anyway, this tortoise had a name from I don't know who, maybe Tadayuki named him, which is "Savage-the-mother-fucker"!!!!!! What a name!!!!! After Toshi and I bought him home, we decided five him a new name. Toshi and I both like 村上春樹,and Toshi is reading a new book of his, which is called 海边のカフカ。 So, we named him カフカ。He is cute and aggressive. We went to Flushing today and bought some seafood for him. I think he likes it. I will try to take care of him 'cause I don't wanna another tortoise die on my hand.!  一个日本朋友近期回国,于是就把他养的一只乌龟给了我.那只乌龟比我原来养过的,不幸因为我的疏忽死掉的两只乌龟大很多.在鱼缸里爬来爬去的,很是好玩的样子.看见乌龟就想起正列的故事,从君敏那里听说正列小时候在上学的路上捡到一只乌龟,因为小的时候常玩超级玛丽兄弟的游戏,所以以为乌龟背上的壳和乌龟的身体是分开的.如果打开乌龟的壳,那么就可以看见一只乌龟裸体跑出来.可想而知,那只乌龟的结果....（听说小正列被吓哭了，因为壳被打开后看见的全是内脏）。说偏题了，回到正题上来。那只乌龟本来有个名字，不过实在是不好听也太长，叫savage-the-mother-fucker.哈哈，不知道是谁取得这个名字哦！！！！于是我就和敏打算重新给他取个名字，正好，敏在看村上春树的新书《海边的卡夫卡》，我们都挺喜欢村上春树的，加上卡夫卡这个名字挺有意思，于是我们就叫他卡夫卡了。卡夫卡蛮活泼的，常常在鱼缸里爬来爬去，吃的也挺多的。希望他能活的好好的。
