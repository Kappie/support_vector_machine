For some reason though, I still feel sad, I don't know why exactly. I know everything is ok, I guess things just seem different, maybe it's just me. I hope it is. I don't know what to do...:::cries::: I need to go study for chem though, I don't wanna!   I tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along
