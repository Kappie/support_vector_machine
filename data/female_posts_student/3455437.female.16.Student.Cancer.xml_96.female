Fossil fuels contribute to global warming, global warming melts polar ice caps, fresh water "desalinises" The North Atlantic current causing extreme weather conditions and ultimatly the end of life as we know it. Although he predicts these events to happen in the next 100-1000 years unless action is taken, after a sequence of extreme weather conditions the global warming catastrophe seem closer than he thinks. Tokyo is struck with bucket-sized hail, New York suffers a tidal wave which wipes out half of the city and spectacular toornadoes destroy LA.  "The Day after tomorrow" is everything you'd expect from a disaster movie: drama, teen romance, stupid herioc acts, cities being torn apart/ flooded/ frozen and the usual cliche's like when Sam (Jacks son) outruns a towering wall of water and later a fast-moving "snapfreeze" and don't get my started on the whole going to New York to save his son. What exactly is he planning to do when he gets there, you think? And when he DOES get there...what does he do? Yeah, that's right..NOTHING.  Luckily the stunning overload of visuals effects make all the bad cliche's bearable, mostly. One thing I must mention is the wolves, pure crap. Not only was it a very bad cliche that didn't fit in at all, the CGI failed miserably.  It's politics however, enviromentalist bush-baiting and the fact that America suffered a whole lot of demolition in the movie(DIE AMERICA DIE!!! mwa ha ha),  amused me.   But I am being cruel, because I actually did very much enjoy the movie there are some spectacular destruction scene's,  I loved the tornadoes in LA and the Hail in Tokyo was interesting. (no, JAPAN!! my precious!!!!) So go see it now..  p.s. If they had have cast someone hotter as Sam then it would have made the movie a WHOLE lot more interesting.
