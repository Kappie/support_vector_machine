Why do i bother trying to do anythin anyways when the results come back all the same. Its a waste of effort. im done with this shit.  complain all you want. what makes you think i care at all? your problem isnt my problem. end of story.  Seek reassurance and all you're gonna get is a fist fulla shit from me. Go ahead feel sorry for yourself. but im not going to join u. if you're gonna act all weird about it.. ill leave u alone u know. youre not worth the effort, youre not worth my time, youre my eye candy. what to think now.. ?  Im outta here im done with this end of the fuckin line.
