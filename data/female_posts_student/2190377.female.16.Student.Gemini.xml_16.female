I can't even write down all the things I'd wanna say.... weeee I went to bed at two yesterday, and woke up at seven by accident -_- But... that's okay! You know what's fun? Car crashes!! weeee. The other day on popeshead this car flipped over, and three busses got stuck on my two lane country road. HAWT. Cause Cause Cause.... I missed my connecter bus to TEe JaY and didn't have to take a sucky ass chem test!!! *dances*  Um.  Yea.  That and I have a 96 in AP Bio, a B+ in Chem... and other good-ish grades! German gingerbread cookies = yummy.  Kelly's "christmas present" was a lifesaver.  She is my angel.  HAha.  Assistive technology club is awesome but Luke needs to go to hell cause hes so good at drawing on the 'puter.  Can you tell I like writing down every thought that pops into my brain?   Now I'm having illicit thoughts.  I'm going to omit those.  I'm starting to love my hum (if only I didn't have a C+ for not turning in some stuff... *angel face*) Mrs. Robbins rocks, and even though Mrs. Martin is off her rocker I'm warming up to her too.  All we did today was discuss traditions... and I made myself look like SUCH a dork in front of fifty people.  SO much fun.  Then Jordan short boy took my balloon for maddie and let it float up to a place where noone could reach it.  At this point I went beserk and starting screaming obscenities about how i was going to eat the midget fetus freak for breakfast.  Turns out he was right around the corner :)  Apparently the kid took off as fast as he could.  Then Boris threw a shoe at it so I could grab it from the overhang.  Unfortunately, it also smacked me in the head.  Either way, my aggression carried over to my basketball game, where I tackled several people and pushed around a bunch of fat girls.  I totally owned all of them.  That and I actually got playing time.  What a great Christmas present Webber!! :D haha.  Oh man, Barbie girl was on our warmup tape.  That must be the magic thing that makes me play like someone 5'10" and like 160 pounds.  hahahahaha .... I played post.  Doesn't that make you laugh? Speaking of basketball, Maria B. is a hottie and I'm going to marry her.  She got me NASCAR nailclippers Christmas.... haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah oh man.  :)    btw.  JOSE R0x0rZ!!! He's my best kept secret.  that, and Rachel Miller is the most confusing girl on the planet.  And Matt deserves another kick in the shins...  heh...  that's all folks  virgogurl4: I HAVE A BIG CRUSH ON HIM virgogurl4: i mean virgogurl4: i dont virgogurl4: my fingers slipped virgogurl4: i meant to say virgogurl4: I LIKE TO CRUSH ORANGES ON HIM
