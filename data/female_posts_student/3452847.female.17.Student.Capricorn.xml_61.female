Rings some truth, as in i am very emotional person, i do cry, i cry a lot, i'm allowed, i get angry, more so now than i have ever known and i get frustrated, there all emotions right? Anyway, if i was always guided by logic then i'd hate it. Jasons away, and guess it means i can't think of him, as hes not here for me to think of, trying to block what happened out of my mind, as i'm sure he is... Mistake is the word, as in i got fucked up over it, not good, again. Plus he has Laura, he should be happy with that... I know they have had arguements, more than she had with Marc, but Marc is a very laid back person who doesn't tend to voice his opinions until later... Just think if he had asked her to try again that night in the cartoon, Jason would be single, and we could maybe meet up for mroe regular times... Fun! Right, if i delve deep into my mind, i like Dave, i know i like him, but i can't figure him out as i hardly see him and hardly talk to him which in some ways is cool, its casual and i don't wait for him to text etc, it just happens, i love that aspect, but i find myself thinking about him sometimes, and i wonder why? Especially about when we were sitting in the long grass and he had his arms round me tightly, that was nice. Comforting. It was a hard night for me, seeing Laura and Jason together, and him talking about the past, and me feeling so god damn mixed up. You see i don't bother talking to anyone about things like this now, as theres no point... Everyone including myself is sick of hearing what i think of him, and what he doesn't think of me, although when we are together Tasha says there is chemistry, but maybe thats simply because we spend so much time together..? I do miss him, but i don't feel hes the same romantic sweety he was to me, to Laura, or with anyone. I re-read what he wrote in the valentines card and that piece of paper with me drawn on it, that was sweet and i will always keep that. It means the world to me, that piece of paper with his writing all over it, talking about me, how much he loved me, describing me... It was perfect. I'm so glad no one knows about this, i feel like i can actually open up, i would never put my diary on a website i knew people would read, its not a diary, its publicly telling people who and what you are.  ~Lisa~
