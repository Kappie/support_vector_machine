I worry about everything and anything...I hate suprises, I hate the way the sun rises in the morning, I hate it when everyone seems happier than me, I hate it when people assume just because I wear black means I am goth, I hate the way people ask you how you are when they know you feel horrible most of the time, I hate YOU! I'm no people person, whatchya gonna do about it eh?!  Right now, I'm going through a rough time. I don't know what I expect of life anymore. I mean, what am I supposed to expect of it! If it's like they say "Life is what you make of it" Well then I wont be going to far. Because I hate life, I hate living, I hate everything about the aspect of breathing and existing. I wish I could cease to exist, yeep : that's it!  As you can read, I am a very bitchy person, who hates people. Bah, not everyone...but, you know who you are the people I DO hate. I am not at liberty to say their names, they would obviously deny that they've been really stupid.  Well, I can always write later...Because now I HAVE to get offline before my Mum goes nuts..! ~Em
