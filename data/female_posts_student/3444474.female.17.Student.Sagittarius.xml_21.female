I'd feel better if I did. The really cheesy thing is that I think of him everytime I hear this song. Once I heard the song, it just kind of clicked in my head that this was the song that made me think of him. It's a comforting feeling, hearing the song and then thinking of him. It reminds me that of all things in this world, there's still one thing I can always rely on; him. It's a nice thought, true or not.   It's the one relationship in my life that hasn't been fucked for one reason or another. For this I am glad. He keeps me sane and grounded, but he doesn't give me harsh reality. He gives me warmth and peace and love.   it's quite comforting.
