(No, it's not one of our profiles thou, disregard the mr avirgan comment si vouz plais)  Haha, so, just out of curiosity how many ppl are getting annoyed with my little "issue" with... we'll call him "Romeo" just for the sake I was just reading that damn book. Anywys, I know ALison and Paula were gettin bored of it last night...  Haha, wht can i say? Romeo is damn fine for a red head. that's all.   Okay- so I officially have a thing for the Backstreet Boys again. Haha, and no, I'm not the only one... Alison, yes, ur with me on this one. Haha, us and paula r officially losers- backstreet boys concerts sure bring back the good 'ol days. Especially when ur watching the stupid dvd and r watching aj hav sex with the stage... Hahah!  BTW: I was wondering, would it really be a crime to kill a sibling? I think i've been provoked to the point where I just might do it... I mean, kill Hillary, or just go ahead and sacrifice ms weiss instead bcuz she's making me redo the damn drama paper. Here's a little message to you ms weiss: if it doesn't say the same thing as the other thing, it's not plagerism- learn to read bitch.   *~*Darcy*~*  I'm only 36 minutes away.
