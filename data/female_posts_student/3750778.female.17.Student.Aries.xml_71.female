Dancing was made to worship God....how can you be at a football game or watching a concert by Britteny Spears...and scream your head off and dance and jump up and down...and then come to church and sit in a pew and just sing a little song and sit down....God wants you to worship him and love him with all your heart...please understand that....and if you dont or if you have any questions feel free to ask me...i want to help you....i love you with alllll my heart and soul........
