I know not too many people read this and/or comment on my postings, but it's personally fascinating to watch me grow as a person through my blogs.  Hope my loyal readers agree with me (Sharon, this is where you come in. lol).    I spent the majority of my summer in Fluoro (always a treat... :) ) and was quite anxious to start school.  The third week of classes has already went by, and we've already had 2 quizzes and a midterm.  Was I dissilusioned into thinking I'd have an unfair advantage?  Because I don't think I have any type of advantage in classwork.  We start clinicals on Monday.  I'm at Childrens for 4 weeks.  I don't know what to think about that.  Well, I'm out.  I'm going to try to enjoy the rest of my weekend and not stress too much over clinicals.  P.S. heres a pic of the kitty!  urlLink Scout
