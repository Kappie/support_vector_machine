You can only study so much til you get totally stressed and everything.  I was just curious.  As for me, curiosity gets me to feelings I don't really want to feel all the time.  I just had to go look at the English marks.  I just had to know so badly.  I got a 64%.  You know what though, I am not really that upset about it.  I put in my 150% effort.  I took my time.  I concentrated.  I believed in myself and in what I was doing.  I used EVERY strategy, yes EVERY strategy I have been taught for reading comprehension.  My average is going to drop, but what counts is that I did my very best.  I guess some people aren't English inclined, or Math inclined, or Chemistry inclined....the list goes on, but frankly that would be demeaning to list what I'm bad at.  I guess I am just the girl who excels at sports, drama, and puts in a lot of effort and tries hard.  That is just me, and I suppose I just have to accept that.  This time I am not going to get upset about a bad mark.  I am going to learn from it.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  And you know, my Bio mark has nothing to do with what I got in English.  I very well believe that with my effort, hard work, and amount of prep time I put in for this final I very well have potential to do good.  I am going to try my best and put my best effort forward, that's all I can do now.  I've learned the material, I've reviewed, I just have to prove what I know and I have to do my best.
