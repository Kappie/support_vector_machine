Of course for myself and my sanity, but more importantly for my children and their well being.  I think it is very important for them to know their family.  I am working on my father in law, but he is a little more distant that the other grandparents.  He wasn't really hands on with Ed to begin with.  When I see my children interact with their auntie and uncle and grandparents I see the love they have for each other and it warms my heart.  I guess for the most part because I didn't grow up with a lot of that.  I think that is why I long for that type of relationship for my children...it is one of the things I lacked in my life and I think it is important to hold special memories with your grandparents.  I know the few that I do have with my grandmothers, I hold very near and dear to my heart.  So anyway, just to update and let you know how wonderful my visit with my in-laws is going.  I know the kids are going to miss them so much when they leave again.  It is too bad we live so far from them now.   I hope you all had a wonderful Easter.
