We were in a science test and this girl was singing Killing Me Softly sooo badly! So if I fail science I'm blaming her. *or maybe i should blame my cat for distracting me all the time by sitting on my revision books* Mmm... random cheesy 80s love songs are getting onto my pc. *aaah!* Aww, but weren't Wet Wet Wet cool? *...* I wonder what they're all doing? Living off their one hit wonders? I would be! Probably ended up playing in bingo halls for 80 year old ladies who are deaf anyway. Nice.
