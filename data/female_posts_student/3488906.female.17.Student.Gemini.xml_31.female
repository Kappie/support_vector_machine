Darn, i've got a scar on my left hand ( humerus , lol learn too much bio ) and have a big bruise on my back. Never felt soo unlucky before, especially when i've got alot fatter these days, i cant deny that it hurts alot. i was about to cry but i didnt. I only act cute to the kids and my sis, telling them how hurt it is. Hehe!  Studied only a liltle today. I aint satisfied with the old guy who teached my driving. He's not even serious at all. Duh, forget about it.  Let's talk about my feelings today in school. It's okay, i just dont like that girl, and i've no reasons why. I wont let myself lose to her anymore. Let's wait and see. It's right to say that i'm one type of person who's very obsessive ( 佔有慾 ? ) , and i dont like the feeling when Miss C is wif HeR. She seemed like she's another different person, more like a stranger. Well, i hate it when i have that kinda feeling. It's like u cant trust anyone else in this world and u can only work on yourself on anything, being mean to anyone and let others hate you.   I'm crapping again. Anyway, good night...  p/s : left 2 months, i'm going to lose weight for goodness sake.
