Well, i cut finger while playing pool. Got plaster from the coutner, and nice evelyn helped me to put them on. She is nice! :))) Had dinner at northpoint's food court. The food there is nice but not very cheap. Chill around there with narene. And so here I am blogging. Stayed over at narene's place the night before ytd, stayed over at cyn's place yesterday. I've been staying out a lot lately. Too slack. Drinking a lot. That is very bad. Anyway, mum and dad is still not back yet. Kinda starting to miss them already. If u guys are reading this, I'll like to say I love you guys lots! Ha. See, Im a filial kid. :))) Not forgetting my dearest brother, hope you are doin fine over there. Enjoy yourself too. Dont forget to come back and visit me, your dear sister. I better get my fingers off the keyboard, and my butt of the chair soon. Gotta get myself to start studying and get that habit. Haiz.. Easier said than done.   Things unacomplished -Hols assignment -Newspaper  Things to be done tmr -Revision for phys -Newspaper  That is about it.  Today is not a really good day for me. But well, Im still happy on this very day. Some stuff are still troubling me. Well, I'm thinking too much. I really am. -shut myself-
