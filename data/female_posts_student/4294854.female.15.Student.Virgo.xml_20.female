Who I think I am:  Friendly but not in that immature annoying kind of way. Smart (not to sound concieted). Im happy at the moment with who I am and how I look. Im proud of all that I've accomplished. I wouldn't trade any of the experiences ive had, good and bad ones. I have a social life. I love music, God, family, and friends. They define really who I am. If i didnt have God i wouldnt even be here. He died for me. Even if i was the only person in the world he would have still died for me because he loves me that much and he loves you! I always smile because thats who i am. Im always laughing and most of the time im having a good time. Im definatly a people person. I would rather be with another person than be by myself.       Well thats about it for now. Just to let you know im totally random and ill probably put the most stupiest stuff up ever. But thats who i am! Ciao!
