I have not written the verses yet. It always amazes me how easily a melody and lyrics will come out of nowhere one night in less than 10 minutes, wheras I will be frustrated working on a song for months and months with no luck.   I'm trying to be constructive. I always find emotional closure from writing songs after an intense relationship or physically intimate encounter with someone. Instead of trying to find meaning in the events, this time I am  trying to make myself remember how I should be living my life and what I should be striving for (instead of concentrating on what went wrong).   However, I'm still baffled over what went wrong. I don't know why Ben acted the way he did. I was at his house for a few minutes watching the Flames game before he was to drive me home. I know he is inexperienced and sexually excited very easily. But I barely know him. Were not that close. And Ive only previously hung out with him in group situtions. Why would he feel so comfortable with me to suddenly tear all of his clothes off as if I were his steady girl that he knew and trusted and was ready to become intimate with. I mean, I barely know him!! how embarrassing but difficult to object to! Next time I see him I dont even know how I'm going to handle myself or what to say. I mean. What do you say? "Hi Ben! Hows it going?  Do I even mention it?        Do I pretend it didnt happen?  I hope I am never in that situation ever again.   Speaking of Bens. Mike and I are mulling over trying to get out to New Hampshire to see Ben Folds with Rufus Wanwright this summer. We'll see if this hypothetical plan can turn to reality.  (I hope!!!!)
