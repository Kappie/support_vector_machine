It's sad to see Nancy Reagan having to go through this never ending ceremony.  After being married to one man for 52 years, I imagine that she's wondering how she will go on.  He's "laying in state" today, and going back to California at the end of the weekend to be buried.  I'm in school full time now.  No more working at Kentucky Lighting (thank God).  It's been six months since I left that job, and yesterday was the first day that I have gone in to see all of the people that I used to work with.  I was actually a little nervous walking back into the store.  When I left I tried to get all of my accounts/customers in order, so that there would be as few messes for others to clean up after my departure as possible.  However, with a job as hectic as that one was, it's almost impossible to tie all of the loose ends before heading out.  So, I was afraid that I'd walk in and they'd all hate me, because I had left them with numerous problems to fix.  They all seemed very happy to see me though.  That doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't screw them over (inadvertently of course), but that they were simply hiding their frustrations.  Oh well.  At least I got the visit over with.   My first semester back at school went very well.  I got all A's and one B (in algebra of course).  I'm taking a statistics class for the first summer session, which will be ending next week.  And, I'm taking my last algebra class in the second summer session which will be beginning in a few weeks.  Then comes the fall semester, which should be my last semester at LCC, before I have to transfer to UK.  I have to contact an advisor in the education dept. at UK to advise me on what I need to do at UK.  I'll probably do that in the fall semester.  Robert's still doing the comic book thing.  I say that as if it was just a hobby that I expected him to drop soon after beginning it.  That's not how I meant it.  Of course he's still doing it.  That's WHAT he does.  He's a comic book writer.  He's doing very well at it too.  He's working on a bunch of stuff for Marvel (which is great), and of course still working on his stuff for Image.  He's traveling alot.  More than I like.  He just told me tonight that he might be going to St. Louis this month to meet a couple of other comic guys.  He's going to Chicago and San Diego this summer, and possibly LA sometime soon.    We've done some traveling TOGETHER this year as well.  In March we went to NYC for spring break.  I don't know what in the hell we were thinking.  It was FREEZING!!!  We were there for the St. Patricks Day parade, which I thought would be fun to see, being that I have never seen a parade in NY.  I was very wrong though.  The crowds were so thick that it was almost impossible to round corners on the streets, it was snowing, the coldest day of our visit, the parade was very unimpressive (although I was impressed that all of those men in kilts braved the terrible whether to march in the parade.  I wonder if they cheated and wore something underneath to keep warm?), and a CRAZY lady stopped and asked me about my heritage.  We had a polite, awkward, and short conversation about our ancestors, and then she handed me a photocopied piece of paper (from a very thick stack that she was holding in her arms) and told me to read it, because she was sure that I would find it interesting.  I stuffed it into my backpack, she walked away, Robert took TONS of boring pictures of the parade, and we finally left.  After hours of fighting through the crowds, asking a very helpful police officer for directions, and walking for what seemed like miles, we finally took refuge in a comic shop (guess who wanted to stop there).  I have never been so happy to be inside of a comic shop in my life.  My legs were numb from the cold.  While he looked at the comics, I pulled out the photocopied piece of paper that the crazy lady had given me.  At that point I hadn't realized that she was crazy, just extra sociable.  Of course, I knew that she had an agenda because she was handing out those papers.  However, once I read what was handwritten on that paper, I realized that she was crazy.  It was all about how she was molested as a child by her black neighbor, and her mother lived next door to a Jew, and all Jews and Blacks should be killed...Of course, as you would expect from any crazy individual handing out racist, threatening material on at a St. Patricks Day parade in NYC, you could only read a portion of the paper.  The handwriting was so bad that at least half of it was unreadable.    Besides the parade, which was only a small fraction of our NYC vacation, we did all of the touristy things - the Met, the Empire State Building (which was very unimpressive - Robert hadn't ever been to the top, so we went, but we could go outside because of the weather, and visability was only a mile because of the snow), Central Park (it was beautiful because of all of the snow, but I've seen plenty of snow on trees...here in Ky, so I would have preferred no snow, and warmer tempts.  However, I'm the idiot who went to NY in March), the Frick House (not as impressive as I was hoping, but I may have just not been in the mood)....We saw some great shows.  Match (Ray Liotta play - very good), The Boy From Oz (Hugh Jackman musical - good, but kinda wish that we had seen something else), and Blue Man Group (FANTASTIC).  I feel a little guilty saying that the Blue Man Group was my favorite show, when the other two are far more artistic (or maybe that's a bad judgement on my part), but they were so entertaining!!    Overall, we had a great time.  By the end of the trip, after the cold weather, and our frustrations with not being familiar with the subway...we were both very anxious to get home.  In fact, we both said that we didn't care if we ever went back to NYC.  While I don't see myself going back anytime soon (there are too many other places in this country that I still haven't seen), I do want to go back at some point.  We bitched alot while we were there, but everytime I think back on it, I remember all of the good things.  We really did have a good time.    We also went to Florida in March.  In fact, we went there and saw his family, and then flew to NYC.  During the July 4th weekend we're going to the Smokies.  It's our gift to my parents for their birthdays (which fall like 3 days apart).  We're renting a cabin, and my parents, my brother and sister, their dog Buddy, and Robert and I will all be staying in it.  It's a large cabin. I'm excited about it.  Hopefully it will be very relaxing.  In September, Robert has a convention in Baltimore.  I'm going to go with him, and after the convention, we're going to go to Washington DC and spend a few days going to all of the monuments...I'm really looking forward to that.    Robert's making one last phone call (he spends so much time on the phone that I don't know how he gets any work done), and then he's giving me the rest of the night (we'll see...).  So, I'm off for now......................
