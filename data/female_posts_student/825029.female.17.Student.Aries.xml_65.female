(jk)  lalalalalallie  yehp..! soooo i guess thats about it.  school and band.  i really hope i make state this year, ive waited long enough...........lol ummmmm yes!  frump. nothing left to say i guess.  i wish the things that are bad that i am not doing a good job at handling would be easier, and i wish that more good things would come and that i would be able to take advantage of them.  so there you go.  ok so thats all i guess! maybe ill think of more later. lates
