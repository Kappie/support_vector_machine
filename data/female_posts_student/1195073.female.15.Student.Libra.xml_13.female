I'm a Republican, and I love Bush to death, but I think he is taking the wrong route here.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who will be at any anit-war rallies or anything along those lines, but I do thing that Bush is kinda 'jumping the gun' here (no pun intended).  Like the Matts said in social studies, I think the war may be more of a personal crusade for Bush, and Iraq has really done nothing to provoke it.  We have no proof that they have ties to any terrorist networks, so really, we have no right to say 'Oh, we can have nukes, but you can't!!!'  Anyway, wow, I just scared myself there.  A little too serious.  Actually I'm serious in all of these, but...............  most of the stuff I say on here is just plain stupid.  Anyways, not much else to say today.  WHOA!!!!  That's a first!!!!  And Matt Z., your Italian soda can KISS MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  MEXICAN SODA IS THA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Especially Limon!!!!!
