So much drama went on since i post bout 3 hours ago. robert helped me realize alot . i need to be stronger than i am. i think the main reason i finally cracked was because its all been building up inside me. i got sent over the top though. no one knows about what happened besides justin and robert and me. i dont want to go into it because id ont want it to stir up more problems. but i want EVERYONE to know that if ive ever hurt you in any way shape or form im sorry, i truely am. i can be rude sometimes without realizing it. right now i dont feel good im gettin another stomach thing where i cant drink anythign with acid in it for about 2 weeks. i guzzeled O.J. earlier tonight. i've been depressed lately , but im starting to realize more and more that my problems arent as bad as someone elses. its not till you hear someone elses problems that you realize how insignificant your own are. i dont know,maybe im just rambling because im tired. today (thursday) is my past day to post before world changers. so ill be missing 9 days haha as if my date counter isnt screwed up enough on this thing. ill be sure to post and tell yall what happened at world changers. but for now its nighty night time! good night to all who are up reading this. and thanks robert for everything!!
