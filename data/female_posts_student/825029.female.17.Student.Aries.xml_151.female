I got back from Florida last Tuesday- we were there for our family vacation, and boy was I glad to get home.  It seemed like the trip would never end, and my parents were driving me up the WALL.  So I was very glad to be back home, but then, one day later, band camp started!  Woohoo.  It hasn’t been too bad- it just takes up a lot of time and I’m always too tired to do anything.  And apparently the 15 or so pit alternates are going to be marching in the show, so that should be interesting.  Now we have to go to the outdoor morning rehearsals *sigh*  Oh well, it was kinda fun yesterday, when we did all the drills.  I’m proud to say I didn’t mess up once!  And Mrs. Visconti even came to my spot and sprayed me down with water.  Mrs. Bohls left last night and she’s going to be gone for the rest of band camp : (   With my luck, I’ll break my reed tomorrow or something, and then I’ll be screwed forever.  I’ll have to *gasp*… buy one of the crappy ones from Brook Mays!  Oh no!  That would be horrendous.  Come back, Mrs. Bohls!  Oh, but I get Vivian’s oboe sometime soon!!  So I’m excited about that, because mine from last year suffered from a minor incident and is now not playing.  So I guess you would call that a major incident.  Heh.  Oh, I thought of another childhood memory for you, Collin.  When I was little, my family and I went out to eat at this Italian restaurant, and when they brought us the bread, they brought those little cups of butter, too.  Well, my sister told me that instead of butter, it was a little scoop of vanilla ice cream, so, being the gullible person that I am, I ate the entire scoop in one bite.  And omg, I can still taste how incredibly awful it was.  I never really got back at her for that one… *evil laugh*  Well, that’s all I have for now.  If Nathan keeps bugging me, I’ll probably start updating this regularly again.  Hope everyone has a nice Sunday off from band camp!  Here’s a couple cool song alerts… Justin Timberlake – “Rock Your Body” Led Zeppelin – “D’yer Mak’er” Jason Mraz – “You and I Both” (Thanks for the cd, Tasha!)
