In days past, great rulers and kings believed so strongly in the insight their dreams carried that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights, or the result of random firings of your brain's release of thought and emotion, there is much to be gained. Recurring dreams hold much significance, as they can point to something that needs to be taken care of. Consider exploring this area.
