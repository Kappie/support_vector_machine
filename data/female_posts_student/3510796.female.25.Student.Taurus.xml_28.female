The skies have clouded up, and the forecasts are calling for a cool and rainy night out on the lawn.  The blankets are in the trunk, the essential tailgating supplies are chilled in the fridge with a cooler and ice at the ready, and yes, I do have my ticket.  Better double-check on that one.  Okay, yeah, got it. 4 new songs tonight, if last night's set list is any indication.  I haven't been to a Dave show since December of '96, and I just know that the whole experience of this evening is going to blow me away and I'll be left with a stupid grin for the forseeable future.  The time to hit the road fast approaches.  140 minutes...
