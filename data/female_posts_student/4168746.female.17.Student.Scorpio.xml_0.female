Time just fades the pages in my book of memories. Prayers in my pocket and no hand in destiny. Cause yesterday's got nothin for me, old pictures that i'll always see. Some things could be better, if we'd just let them be...         but anyways... I dont kno.. todays been kind of a eye opener for me. Yea, i think a lotta times that my life sucks, but ya kno... i have a lot of things that sum people dont.  Maybe i'm just selfish and a baby at times. Yea i'm stubborn ((ppl tell me that a lot)) ... hah.. how proud right?       But anyways, i kiinda got the job at the marion star.       Thiings with marcus are still the same      Things with trav are still the same.      Ummm big figh with my friend eric... ((which led to my eye opening or whatever))      Mom is doing okay after the surgery. She's sick a lot but i guess thats cause of her nervs and shit actin up. I guess she's really nervous about the results, but i'm thinkin that they will come back fine. Atleast i hope so.      Jen Phillips contacted me about senior girls wearin jerseys for the first game... of couse i'm in baaaby. lol. We buyin tee's for the 2nd game i guess.       Senior year... can't wait..
