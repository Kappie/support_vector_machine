I am not sure what I should write, in the hopes of maintaining the interest of fellow bloggers, but I will make an effort.  First off: I am sixteen and in college.  Seriously.  When it's time for fall semester, I will be seventeen, but I am enrolled now and have my final day of my first course tomorrow.  I am an English major, and if I seem too verbose, let me know.  Life for me is misery and depression, and I absolutely adore my mother.  Yep... adore ...  I have nothing else to say right now, so I will get off the library computer I am battering with my stubby little fingers and let someone else web surf for God only knows what.
