As the summer comes to a close I find myself procrastinating more and more each day, I still haven't called Susy (must do it tomorrow), and I still have not organized my desk, madness I tell you.  But I have been sorting through my work from last year, and I was thinking about how much I am going to miss the ninth grade, and my class.  It will never be the same, some things are just not meant to be.
