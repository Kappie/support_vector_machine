Been preparing for the AP Bio test on monday! ahh shoot me in the face.  Oh well.. Training, well that's been great as normal.  Seems to be the only thing keeping me going to school day to day for the most part.  I always have tons of laughs in there and Im finally good at something.  That's really something Im going to miss next year... I'll still be doing it just not at northern and that saddens me.  Prom is tomorrow.  Been stressing a lil, ok a lot, over it all.  Its just so much work. I want it to be over, ok maybe not over but at least get started... then I won't have to stress... :-) I can't believe senior year's almost over.  It's crazy. Im so excited. Im tired of all the highschool bullshit and dealing with certain people.  I want to make friends (true friends- Im not sure if I can concider anyone a true friend right now- except Matt- but I want true girlfriends, that might be hard though now, since I have trouble trusting them) I want to learn new things, practice new things... grow as a person. I want to only have to talk to people from northern that I want to keep in contact with (probably very few and probably mostly teachers- and the training crew) I want to get away from home and prove I can make it.... Its just hard to believe its over.  I got some great news about a possible summer job(s)... will share more once all is official... k... time for bed... later!!
