So like I said, on the weekend, I was shipped off to some friends of the family for the weekend, Gitte and Bent, they were both in their early fifties but they were sooo funny, and they have travelled like EVERYWHERE in the world!... ok not quite everywhere, but close enough...   So, I arrived there friday arvo and together the three of us cooked food, sat in the lounge room and drank wine while and spent half the night just talking togetgher which was very nice. Turns out that they both love Les Miserables, too, which was very nice. Which remindes me, I am still waiting for SOMEONE to send me over my copy... (hint hint mum) Anyway, just before we went off to bed, they gave mde a present to remember them by, a dressing gown thing made from real chinese silk with embroided dragons on it, it is soooo nice! They got it when they were in china..... obviously..... OH and I also went grocery shopping with them, and we bought fresh artichokes and ate them for entre which reminded me of our old artichoke plant back home. Which is now 'expired' as the three of us would put it.   So the next day we were up bright and early and on our way to Nyborg, a small harbour town on the island of Fyn. To get from Sj√¶land to Fyn we had to cross the longest hanging bridge in the world... well, it was ONCE the longest hanging bridge in the world. For about 2 months until the Japanese built a longer one...lol. Ayway, we were there because their son, Kenneth, is in the Navy and his ship was docked their for the weekend so we went to visit him. The boat was very cramped and kind of crappy, I dont know how he has managed living the past 4 months on it!... so we made Swedish pizza for lunch which was super dooper and then went for a walk around the town of Nyborg and looked in an old church... came back to the boat for coffee and biscuits. I ate the buiscuits but didn't dare touch the coffee, the machine looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in a long, long time!... and besides, I dont like coffee... Kenneth took photos of EVERYTHING using the phone camera which was funny. We all made fun of him for it.   So after our boating adventure, we took a car trip (minus Kenneth who had to watch the boat) so a place where Gitte og Bent could stock up on beer (and stock up on beer they did!) and we went to the biggest rock in Denmark, Damestenen (The Lady Rock)of a whopping 42 metres! Not quite as big as Ayres Rock, but well, Denmark is a very small country. Gitte and I had a photo shoot on the top of the rock :) If I ever find the pics I will find somewhere to post them so you can see them...   And second last on our little sightseeing adventure was a castle, I can't remember what it was called, but I do know that it had over 1,000 singular window panes (it said so on the brochure!) So we looked around the castle for a while, it was the nicest castle I have seen in denmark yet, but I have only seen 4. And yes folks, Katie is now part of history, having been to a real, danish castle toilet! I'm sure you all wanted to know that. So anyway...   Then we looked around the castle grounds, and they had a little museum thing with all these old antique cars, very nice indeed! Then Gitte and I needed to pee again so we went on a bold search for the museum toilets... which we didn't find. But what we did find was a secret hallway, called 'Draculas Mansion'... It was like this creepy, really dark hallway thing with crypts and spider webs and creepy organ music playing in the backbround. And at the front it had the story of the real dracula and how the dracula stories began, which was really interesting....   So there were Gitte and I, standing at the edge of Draculas Mansion, neither of us daring to go foreward... 'Shall we go in?' I asked Gitte, clinging to her arm... it was a very creepy hallway... 'Uh... I guess.' Gitte replied. We both took a tiny step foreward. .... .... We both looked at each other. 'uhhh... Lets wait for Bent..' We decided we needed a strong, male presence to protect us from dracula.   So we went back, collected Bent and walked into Draculas Mansion, both us old ladies clinging onto Bent like glue. It was so funny, Just as we were going in, we stopped for a few seconds. Gitte looked behind us and screamed, jumping five feet in the air... which made me scream and jump five feet in the air. This German tourist just suddenly appeared behind us, and because of the rain outside, had a hooded jacket on which in the shaddows looked sooo much like a cape! Lol, anyway, Gitte, Bent, the German tourist and I stod there and laughed for like 5 minutes because it was so funny... i guess you just had to be there!   After the museum, we walked through the gardens. The castle grounds had 4 mazes, although we didn't have enough time to go in any of them. I noticed one of them was made out of bamboo. I thought this rather pointless as you could pretty much see through the hedges... and wasn't that NOT the point of a maze. There was a small tree top walk, where we could walk on little hanging bridges 15 metres in the air, among the tree tops... although certainly not as big nor impressive as the one that was like 80 metres high in Australia, I thought it was still nice. After that we continued our way through the gardens... 'sampled' a strawberry or two from the strawberry patch, and a raw gooseberry... then exited the gardens. Because it was the castles 450th birthday, a single entry fee will automatically come with a year pass... Gitte spelt my name as 'Catie' rather than 'Katie'which I thought was rather cool.   So then on the way back, we stopped at this little resteraunt thing for dinner. Its a quiet little cottage in the middle of a forest, I liked it a lot! Anyway, it was a buffet kind of thing, help your self deal. And we sure helped ourselves! There was soooooooooo much food there, seriously I dont think I can write just how many different kinds of food! So, naturally we wanted to try everything there... and the good stuff we wanted to try twice... we had marinated steak, spare ribs, chicken kabads, curried lamb, baked mini potatoes, fried potato, potato salad, pasta salad... and the list goes on! So yeah, we were very very full indeed when we went back to the car, and I slept until Copenhagen. It was an early night that night, we had a big day! Lol!   The next day they said I could sleep in, they had no plans. Now, I'm not sure what they ment by 'sleep in' but when I got up at 11am, they were all like 'Woooow! Good Afternoon, Jonas!' (they have a joke with this guy they used to know called Jonas who slept all the time... so I became Jonas) It was funny, though. So that day I did not a lot, just sitting around and talking to Gitte and Bent, and then I scrubbed and peeled 50 million potatoes. Fun fun fun! Now, this is kinda strange for denmark, but Gitte and Bent have a little pit fire in their backyard and that night we cooked fresh salmon and potatoes in the fire, and as much as I dont like fish all that much, it was sooo good!   That night I went home with Marianne and Anne and Niels, normal life back at the host families!   Anyway gtg,   Update again another time!   Luv Catie/Katie/Jonas
