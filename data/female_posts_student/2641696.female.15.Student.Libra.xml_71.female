Mostly because I don't use those browsers, and also mostly (yes, two mostlies) because this is horrendously bad coding heh. I am not an XHTML wizard. Sorry. Go get IE if you want legibility.   Secondly!! Anime North was soo insanely fun!! N didn't show up, but we didn't need him because I met tons of people!! I hung out with S for most of the day, because T and S were in a fight and T was soo obsessive over that Dance Dance Revolution game... (holy shit those people have twinkly toes). I even bought a manga!! It's the first one in a series called Wish. It's crazy though, because, to be more authentic, it goes backwards... like, the front of the book would be the back of the book in normal books. Um? Yes, confusing. lol. Anyway, S got it cheaper for me ^^; Said it was in bad condition or something... hehehe.   And then we all started hanging out together again because me and S bought 3 Gun Smith Cats manga for A (who is like in love with that thing) -- in Japanese and everything. And we got a Cardcaptor movie for T, and lucky S, he got the other one. Great deal though. Only $20 for it all. Yayy!   So yeah, after buying a bunch of stuff, me, S and two guys who I didn't really talk to called A and R went to the hotel and saw Anime Idol (LOL!), a few anime movies, a few video game competitions, then went back to the Dealer's. Oh! And we went to the Art Exhibition too! There was some really good stuff there, and some really BAD stuff there. S is convinced someone is ripping off A, but I think he's just paranoid and overreacting.    Had lunch at Mr. Sub's (grilled chicken sub -- very yummy!! ^^;) and dinner at Swiss Chalet. Stupid T for not coming to eat with us!! By then she had a whole crew of DDR fanatics like herself. Actually I think one of 'em bought her like a $20 wallet by the end of it... she's got herself a fan club, man. BTW!! Really nice make-up, too.   It was absolutely pouring and miserable by the end of it, and I left at around 8:30. I am also convinced that I need my own cellphone. I was so paranoid I'd get split up from everyone else, and be unable to find anyone because I didn't have a phone... *sigh* Ok, ok, everyone is right. Cellphones are, after all, useful. Blargh!   All in all, though, it was insanely fun. I wish I brought a camera! (and a backpack, and food, and... thank you  so much  guys for preparing me... *sarcasm* lol) Tons of people were in costumes; they had a masquerade later. All the people were crazy-nice and funny and sweet, and it was just awesome!! So yes, I'll be sure to go to the August one, too. Actually now I'm mad, because I just finished the Wish manga and I wanna find out what happens to Madam Hisui and Kokuyo!! *g*   So yes, now it's my sister's bday. Yayy! (*sarcasm*) I don't like birthdays. I just like the birthday cake.
