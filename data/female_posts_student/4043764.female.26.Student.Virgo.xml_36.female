Remind me to never take  urlLink mefloquine  again. Or those other drugs that degrade memory and make one psychotic.  atlblingbling caved to her BIB again. She is so like me. Not only do our "ex's" have the same first name, they have the same fucking neuroses. And we continue to feel some sadness when they express their sadness.  I guess I can only end with this line from  urlLink Bad(der) Santa . "Why don't you just shit in one hand and wish in the other? See which one fills up first." Not sure what it means on a literal level, but I think the philosophy is this: Shit is more tangible?
