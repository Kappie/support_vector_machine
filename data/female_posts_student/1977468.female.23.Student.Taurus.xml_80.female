There were swimming pools everywhere, and a rocky beach, and people I knew, and we were all having fun.  Until *they* came.  The Navy Seals were onto us. They started coming in off the beach, I fortified my position in some bushes and started working my crazy magic with the shotgun I keep in my pocket. Things got worse from there, some Colonial English soldiers thought it would be cool to join the fray, which was more then okay with me because I had found a browning .50 calibur machine gun on a sidewalk. I remeber some other fragmented things, like me shooting a fat guy in the back, but esstentally I was the last man left and they were all looking for me, when 6 Stars started blinking at the top of my vision. Thats right ladies and gentlemen. I HAD FINEALLY REACHED 6 STARS. I've never been able to (in grand theft auto 3). But I was dead right after that, because they brought in those invisibal stalkers from balder's gate 1  2. I couldn't hit them fast enough.  In the second dream I actaully had a wife or girlfriend or something, and basically we were running from her mother. We were at her mother's house and she was INSANE. The obvious solution was just to kill her, but she had some kind of magnetic field around her body that deflected bullets. So it was this huge car chase, we were driving through all this country until we eventaully reached a huge city on the coast. We tried to hide there, but eventaully we had to ditch the car because the wife drove it through a restaurant. I remember us hiding in this dark alley and the mother was walking slowly down it looking back and forth for us. She was huge and ugly she was. And she had some other cybornetic abilities. She used mind control on the police we called. I remember we dailed 911 before we got to the city, and it was this long computerized list of "if you are going to die, press 1. If you have cut yourself, press 2.". But she used jedi mind control on the cops once they found us anyway.  In the third dream I was out in the wilderness. I had no weapons or anything. An EVIL man had CAPTURED Funshine Bear!!! He was using him in a long lost ritual to convert Carebears into torrents of epic power. He was waiting to sacrifice Funshine (who was sedated) to the Queen Wasp (who was only the size of a normal wasp).  The Queen Wasp had arrived when I tried to stop the man. He pulled out a hand gun and so I started running. There was alot of tall grass I could hide in, but he started following my trail. WELL, I double backed around a large group of bushes and made it back to where Funshine was. I grabbed him and started running for this hill, because the freeway was on the other side of it.
