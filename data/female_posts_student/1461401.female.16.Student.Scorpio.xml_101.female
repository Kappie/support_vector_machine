Haunt your dreams. No matter how hard you try. It will find you in the end. No matter how hard you try. The truth will find you in the end.  Man, I just realized I'm repeating myself. *sigh* I don't like what I've done. I can't take it back though, for it is what I wanted to happen. I just didn't want to face it. I still wish I hadn't.  I don't know. I feel bad.
