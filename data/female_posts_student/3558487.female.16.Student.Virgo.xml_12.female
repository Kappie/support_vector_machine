It's not like i'll be able to hang out w/ them anyway cuz i'm going to be busy these next couple of days, but still... the thought of the others gone is sad. :(  Anyway... i saw 'mean girls' tonight with my sister. It was very funny... they thought of some really cruel things to do! I'm glad that my friends don't secretly hate me and that they don't try to ruin my life... thanks guys! I appreciate it!   Leadership camp (aka try to kill them by running and doing crazy pushups camp) is getting better by the day. It's actually not that hard w/ the exercises and stuff, i'm just outta shape.   I'm getting my hair cut on monday... any suggestions on what i should do will be appreciated!   I guess that's all that i have to say right now...   bye guys!  -Lisa  Song: "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" - The White Stripes
