I was in a really crazy mood for most of it. Monday - Becca's house!  :) Tuesday - No bitches could make it to the casa. Wednesday - Babysat, wasted some baking needs. Thursday - I couldn't go to Chip's house ---sad. (Ha, you ARE in this thing.)  I had a piano lesson, testing my endurance of back pain from sitting up straight. Damn, last night was WEIRD.  I got out of the shower, and I felt suddenly really tired.  So I put my head down (and the rest of me) and I went out.  I slept like a rock for 11.5 hours.  Unfortunately, I had some Big Red in my mouth at the time, and it stayed there all night long.  And I had a really weird dream that I don't remember very well, with Big Red in it.  So, I got up at like 11 the next morning with the most awful taste in my mouth.  Poor teeth.  It felt like there was a hole in my tongue.  Yuck.  Haha, and my journal was on the bed, which was weird.  I slept with my journal.  Anyway, that shit was crazy.  I'm just glad it didn't get on the bed or in my hair. Mary is coming home tonight for the weekend!  YAY!  That should be fun.  She's been laughing at me because Raleigh gets crazy after an inch of snow, and it's like negative 100 degrees in Maine.  I'm glad I don't have to be that cold.  I get grumpy. Hey, does anyone who has Mrs. Krizmanich for English think I should spend my time finishing that short story that we were supposed to have read a week ago?  I probably won't.  But you know something annoying?  I left my planner at school again.  And honestly, I don't remember what the homework for the weekend is.  Ooops.  Hahaha, not a good idea to leave stuff like that out.  Last time I left my planner, Mrs. Carr found it, and it was open to where I had clearly written that school is a hellhole.  Ooops again.  At least it didn't ramble on about how I hate her class.  That would be awkward. Alright, guys, I hope you've enjoyed the products of how bored I've been this week, i.e. these blog entries.  I'll see you all later.
