I did this in my last relationship, where I became really uptight about EVERY LITTLE THING! and it drives both mike and I crazy, thus creating mini-arguments and those slowly wear down a relationship, and this is what happened last time that happened: break up. No, FUCK THAT. Not breaking up with Mike, heeeeeeeeeeeeellll no. I love him way too much. What I think he and I need to do...is see other people. NOT LIKE THAT! But our friends. He go hang with the boys for a night, I chill with the chicas. It's like I love to spend every minute with this boy, and I know it's mutual, but it's not healthy. as the great nate myatt said to me-   "Relationships are a lot like songs. If you listen to it all the time, you get sick of it, but if you space it out, you love it even more as it plays."  how true it is.   It's gonna kill me at first to be like ok you have fun, I'll talk to you later sometime. RAR! Space is good, just keep repeating that.   MUAH! RIBBONS AND BOXES!
