Lust overcame my heart and I pulled away from Godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin. Yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, I found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft. Godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when I felt him slip through my fingers. Godde continues to hold me together as I am writing these words.  It felt like coming home when I received communion. I could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul. When I tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church. When I drank the wine, I could feel the blood of Christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead. Catholics believe that the Eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of Christ. Episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the Eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.  In my opinion, Christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament. Long before there were numerous denominations, the early Christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine. They risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act. The Eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of Christ, binds Christians to one another.  Growing up in a Southern Baptist tradition, I received communion during two services a year, Christmas and Easter. I never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when I started attending services at the Episcopal church, I thought it strange that Episcopalians received the Eucharist every single Sunday without fail. Now, I can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before I go out into the world. It is the ultimate business card,  please, take our Savior with you. His body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you . It is an incredible gift.  This is the reason that I am a Christian. The Eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with Gene was falling apart. I know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide Christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart. The Eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change. It is an integral part of the faith. It is what brings Christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is a blessing. It is home.
