Jesus answered them,   "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."    The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"    But the temple he had spoken of was his body.  Ohh...  Think about that.  Puts the Resurrection in perspective, doesn't it?
