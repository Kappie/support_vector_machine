They only have about 9-10 days (including today)!!! The frustrating things are not so much what has to be done in the basement, we can get that done when they're gone, but the things that must be moved to the basement (practically all the contents of the kitchen, bathroom, etc.). It is tremendously exhausting.  And even when all this is set and done, there's still a matter of sitting down with my parents to decided who'll take on what responsibilities like maintaining my parents banking accounts, my grandma's, backyard and frontyard maintainance, monthly bills, etc. So although freedom seems to be coming around the corner, responsibilities are looking to take over. It's kind of bittersweet, gaining the freedom of living in our own "place", yet taking on the responsibilities of the entire household.  Oh well, we'll see how the transitiongoes through. Only time will tell.
