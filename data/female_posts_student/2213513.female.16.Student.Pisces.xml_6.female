Haha, at the party I won the travling bunco prize and I was at the head table, parterned with Joshua!...for whoever doesn't play bunco I'm not going to explain it but when you get a bunco you get this little bunco box or something and then when someone else gets a bunco you give it to them, and i was the last person with it so i won that prize! also I had to roll off with like 3 other people for most wins, which was exciting! lol, bunco was so fun at that party, usually i get bored with it after a while. Other that that this weekend, lol friday we had our first tourny for wrestling and we got 2nd out of 8 teams, which was really good. Saturday other than the party I had to go to a frosh wrestling tourny, which sucked, Kari, Kaitlin and I really didn't have to be there,  If  the other F-ing managers knew how to score! I woke up at 5:45 for those mo's. Then I spent the night at Kari's, i really didn't want to be at home because Mark was here and I never do anything when he's here b/c he and my mom always go run arrands all day long. Then my mom got all mad because I didn't call her when I was at Kari's to tell her what was going on, BUT she always calls me when I'm at Kari's....tell me how that makes sense...it doesnt. My mom is just dumb, it was because of Mark and I know it. She knows it too, she just wanted a reason for me not to feel forgotten, so she blamed it on me! I hate how shes changing because of Mark! I know shes happy but does that mean she has to sacrafice my happiness!? I just wish I was old enough to move away, then she could just do what she wanted b/c I wouldnt see her anyway. Seriously, I'm tired of him. I don't care if he's the reason we go on rafting trips and the reason we go to sunriver. I would rather not do those two things than have to keep watching my mom change because shes going out with him. Sorry, if you are totally lost or if that was kind of harsh, I had to vent. I've been thinking about just not caring about my D in photo and seeing what she does if I have a D on my report card. Except that if I do that, i'll become a majority. All the kids who do that, do it because they have family problems and they need attention and/or just stop caring. I don't want to become one of those people. The thing is, my mom is marring this stupid guy even if I keep not liking him. I wonder if I could just not keep in touch with my mom but still keep in touch with the rest of the family, like when i grow up. B/c shes not marring him till Teagan, Ben and I are in college...Ok, I need to stop, this is getting long and too rude. Aloha. *Kate ~love is like a role that we play
