So hooray to that, I won't be going naked to banquet this year.  Saturday night was crazy. haha. Oh my gosh. Grape Schnapps is the worst stuff ever. There is nothing worse.  Nothing.  Me and Rachel had to drink that nasty nasty CRAP. I almost died. We even tried mixing it with coke. Didn't help. Only made it that much worse. Also, I spilled Grape Schnapps, Grape juice and whiskey in my room. Congrats, Shauna. Then, at FIVE am Sunday morning we went for donuts dressed like crazies, and then got followed by a crazy white car.  Yesterday, went to Six Flags, and saw this great band with this super super hot guitar player. Wow, he was hot. And then he came up and talked to us, which was mucho coolness. Did I mention that he was amazingly hot?  Yes, well, that's about all. I'm starting my  diet  today. Wish me luck.  Crazies make the world taste better. Later.
