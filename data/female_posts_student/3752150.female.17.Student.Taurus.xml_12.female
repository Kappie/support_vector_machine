First I went to the beach with Jen, Kev, their kids, and sarah.  The water was actually warm for a change and the beach wasn't quite as nasty as it used to be.  After that was the youth group bonfire and that was exciting.  Ross painted BethAnnes toes and I kissed Ryan's foot.  Ewwww... it was this thing we had to draw from a bowl.  It took me like 10 minutes to actually do it.... yeah anyhow....  then we played I've never, which was fun and I flipped over the chair.    You know what's fun?  Downloading techno remixes.  Techno itself doesn't interest me but techno remixes are hot.  I downloaded ice ice baby, kiss the girl (Little Mermaid), pacman, and I will survive techno remixes.  I think I'm gonna make a cd out of them.  Yeah well I guess that's all for now maybe I'll write more later..
