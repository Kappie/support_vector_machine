There are a lot of things (friends, record exchange) that I wish were here now....  But the whole place itself....  It was like that sweater that grandma makes the kid in the sitcoms all the time: it's ugly as hell and itches, but the kid has to wear it because he's  obligated .  Yeah, that's it exactly.  But now things are different.  I have no idea what the future has for me, and it's thrilling.  Back  there  I could look down a street and see myself thirty years later... and nothing about me had changed.  I was scared shitless.  But now....  Maybe this instability isn't healthy.  I don't really know, but it's no better to be so stable you forget to grow.  And if we're going to use the tree analogy... the roots grow and grow and eventually have to reach out to new places, right?  A person can't stay the same and expect to be something.  But then again, maybe I'm rationalizing.  I can't say for certain, but it seems to me like these fresh starts kick way more ass in real life than they do in the movies.  Seriously.  If I could bottle this and sell it to people, I'd be rich.
