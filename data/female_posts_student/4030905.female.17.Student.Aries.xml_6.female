I was planning to join Chinese congregation but Charissa said I'm mad or something like that. haha..i dun really mind her saying that. cos i agree that my Chinese is terrible. Anyway i'll be attending Chinese service with Si Ning and Janice Lim(if she wakes up early to go church). Today we went to Geylang for lunch, for a change. Tried smelly beancurd..it really stinks and i hate it. yucks! if it was tasty, it wouldn't be named 'smelly beancurd'..lolx..   It's already been three weeks since school started and I guess I'm getting along fine. Except that I dun really like the practicals. so sickening and troublesome. But I'm a student, so i gotta study..School's real FUN! especially having new friends around me and we always crap and do all sorts of funny stuff like the happy tree friends thingy..but it was cool rite? haha..new friends..hmm..pple such as Roy,Theodore,Wilson(very dao),Jarren(pinky),Keith(Scooby Doo),Jeremy,Nicholas..Steph Lim is old fren..hmm..basically this group of us go for lunch together..BUT there's these few of us who're always late for every lesson..me,Lim,Roy,Theo,Wilson,Jarren...cos we're in the same class..hahaha :p   The subjects that we study are quite okie..(except for practicals!) TBCM can be considered the best tutorial..cos the teacher is easy to get along with and we can do all sorts of funny things like locking her outta class and using her account to logon to happy tree friends..wahahaha~the next subject that i like is CRS..cos there's no maths and practical required..our first homework for CRS was to watch Spiderman 2..can u believe it??   I'll stop my crap now..cos I think I'm writing too much and it's only the first entry!
