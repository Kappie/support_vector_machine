Nothing to exciting happened on my run.  It was a calm and relaxed 3.3 miles   Wednesday run was a nice one as well.  In fact my brother timed us as we were running and I did 3.3 approximately in 31:29, which is the fastest thus far for that many miles.  I noticed the more I run the easier 3 miles gets.  Depending on what our next week schedule I may boost up to four.     I weighed myself this morning and I came in at 172.  When running weight likes to fluctuate to the extremes.
