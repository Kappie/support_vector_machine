Without further ado let's get the gun loaded and ready:   STEP 1: The first step to having a successful suicide attempt is to give off signals that you are becoming suicidal. That way when you pull the trigger, people feel more blame for having ignored your hints and then you affect even more people then just yourself. This is key to ending your worthless, hard life. The first thing you need to due is become anti-social. Friends going to the movies and then some ice cream? Not you, you are going to sit at home in the dark and listen to Dashboard Confessional, and when someone asks you what is wrong you will say "Nothing, I'm just tired", but when you say this, it is key that you give off the "I'm full of shit and want to kill myself look". Seclude yourself. Be pessimistic.   STEP 2: After giving off hints, it is time to confide in a friend or write letters and let your friends find them. When your friends address you and offer their help, make sure you deny it and again say "Nothing is wrong", be convincing this time, I don't want them to stop you from ending your life. When your parents get worried and start to pry into your personal life, give them the guilt trip and then go upstairs, lock yourself in your room, and make slits in your arm but make sure they are not noticeable and will only be seen by your friends. If your parents see this your attempt at riding the world of a dipshi....depressed person with a meaningless life will be ruined. RUINED, I TELL YOU. First 2 steps are easy enough, now comes the time to write your suicide note and pick your weapon of choice.  STEP 3: Make sure that you become such an outcast that people at school start to make fun of you. So when you finally end your life they feel the repercussions as well. Be sure a day or two before you do it that when someone blurts out "Hey fatty" you counter with "You know you could make someone kill themself with comments like that" and hope they say "Please kill yourself." If they say the that, it will be a great feeling you give them when they find out you did what they wanted. Also be sure to hit yourself or create some kind of pain when they call you names, so they think you are a freak. It is important that you create this loner image-- be sure to sell it.  STEP 4: Writing the suicide note is the most important thing. This are the last words people will remember you by. Since this is crucial I will give you a template suicide note and you can fill in the blanks where you see fit.     Dear insert name here,  I can't live with this sadness no longer. I needed to end the suffering before I affected others, it was the only way out of the pain. For "insert your age years" I have lived with this pain. Now it has come to a close and will no longer eat away at me.  Mom and Dad - it is not your fault, you guys were great even though I didn't get that $40,000 pony when I was 7, it wasn't that or the time you were 10 minutes late to pick me up from "insert best friend name". I love you guys and want you to know that it isn't your fault.  Boyfriends/ girlfriend's name - I love you, but how could you cheat on me with that stupid slut. After you told me we were going to get married. We had been going out 2 months and you just did that to me, but it isn't all because of you. We were gonna run away and live by the ocean and have a baby each day of our healthy lives. I knew I couldn't make anyone happy or even myself. Remember me forever and don't forget the precious times we had together.  Mom and Dad please don't cry over me, and I am sorry my "insert comment of how your body or guts will be found" the last thing I wanted to due was hurt anyone. However there was no other choice.   insert partial poem or quote about life  your name here     STEP 5: Copy that word for word and you will be sure to give your family members and loved ones the greatest gift of life. Now on to following through with your stu...suicide. I would suggest taking a gun to your temple or in the mouth it is the least painful and you will have a closed casket so no one has to see your "ugly ass" one last time. Also the walls will be stained with your blood which is the perfect everlasting memory to give to your parents. Be sure to have a picture of your parents and you near the scene of the suicide to add to the effect. If you find that too gruesome or do not have a handgun readily available, then I suggest hanging yourself when your parents leave and do it right in front of the front door, so when they get back from "ignoring their picture perfect child" they will see your body swaying side to side. This will make them feel even more responsible because they left you alone. We all know that you should never leave your kid alone at home. If you do not feel like doing this then swallow some kind of poison or pills or slit your wrist, however I highly recommend one of the first two options; the others are not as gruesome and do not have as much lasting affect.  If you are considering committing suicide or you know someone who wants to, please let them read this so they can get through it and end their life. The easy way out is not to be a reasonable person and realize that shit happens and move on, but to kill yourself. Realize there are no other options and get on with the show. Also if you could record it and have the tape sent to me that would be awesome. If you have problems pulling the trigger remember Nike...Just do it. So what are you waiting for...CLICK CLICK BOOM.
