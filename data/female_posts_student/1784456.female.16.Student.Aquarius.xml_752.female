I think there is! But Laura isn't sure... geez we're so dumb! If there is we don't get it in England! or we don't. Mmm... we just get sucky stuff! Ok so I told Laura every thing and now we're scared! Hehe... great... Any way, nothing happened today cause every one else was at the zoo and we're going tomorrow! Yeay! Anna said (according to Lynne) that they we're 'protecting' Emma by not telling her... I'm not sure though. I just did what I thought was best I guess! Every one does that though I hope!  urlLink http://www.funbrain.com/ Aaaargh locked in there in Maths! Noooo! We forgot to sing the 'I will survive' song! Ack, I need new entertainment, Ally Mcbeal has finished and I'm boiling hot! Uhuh... oh and hungry! We had to play rounders at lunch time and we didn't get to eat any thing. :( Some one shouted out 'social rejects' apparantly... and darn proud of it! I didn't get to eat any of my dinner though, and then I got back home and found out it was all gone off! Eww! Does any one really care? That's my question, I'll go brew it.
