And Caitlin was wearing a shirt that had flames on the front and said "the fire within us" and on the back it said "o.a.r." Then last night I had a dream that our little lunch group was at school having lunch, and Logan was going to beat up Matt because Matt was playing around and said I was weird. Yeah it was really strange... haha.  Might do something tomorrow if I can get some people together. Maybe the movies or something. My mom is being really stupid and yelling at everyone for the tiniest things and it's getting really annoying. I need to get out of the house.  13 days till my birthday! I'm really excited. :-D
