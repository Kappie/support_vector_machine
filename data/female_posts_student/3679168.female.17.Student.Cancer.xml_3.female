She needed to understand more than anyone why IM like that. I gave her the information she needed now it's up to her to do what she wants with it, whether it's keep it to her self, forget it, or be a better mom because of it.   What I said was very hurtful but I guess that's what I had to do. She doesn't listen to me and I hope she did this time. I told her that her and my dad were insignificant in my life and all they are to me is the people who put a roof over my head and give me money when I need it and as soon as I am able to provide that my self they wont mean anything to me. I told her that they treat me like shit and if they every want me to treat them respectfully again they have to earn it. What else I said is kind of hard to explain but I'll try, When I get in trouble for something small like not picking up my stuff I get in so much trouble for it that you cant punish me any more, so when I get in trouble for something really bad like not calling to tell them IM staying some were and when they finally call me at 2 am IM wasted well the trouble I get in for something like that is just as bad as not picking up after myself because I get in so much trouble for small things all the time it doesn't phase me when I do something really wrong. You know what IM saying. See its hard to put into words but I told her that and that that's the reason I laugh when IM in trouble because IM winning cause IM not mad. But I don't care they need to understand what they are doing. Yah my parents are fucked up I know!
