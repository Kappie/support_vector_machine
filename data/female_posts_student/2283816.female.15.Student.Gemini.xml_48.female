I don't know shit." Grrr. I hate you, Gwyneth Paltrow. And you, Jennifer Aniston. And you, lead singer of Coldplay. I don't hate you, Johnny, because you're a smart guy anyway and you're allowed to have opinions. Unlike your fellow moronic contemporaries.   Well, they can have opinions, but why don't they just SHUT UP AND ACT?!  I went golfing today. It was a practice thing and I did somewhat badly but made it to 100 yards. Go me. I also went rock climbing the other day - THAT was the most strenuous thing I think I've ever done. It was really cool and unique, though... I could begin to like it if I had more access to it.   I love art. I love the fact that anybody could think up some brilliant beautiful thing in their head and then have the genius to get it out and down perfectly. And it's so deep and fulfilling and moving... and there's that sense of happiness at bringing something totally original and creative into the world. Something, some part of you. Some different beautiful THING. Making the world just a little bit richer and vibrant and colorful.  So you see, I might not know much of the technical aspects of art, but I think I've got the whole soul thing down pretty well. I'd have to like art or I couldn't like or write about Alexei (who is my favorite guy. I've never loved a character quite so much and I love doing things to him).   I might as well talk about my story here, seeing as nobody has to read it if they don't want to/get bored, and I'm anxious to talk about it.  Spoilage is very possible, so if you haven't read it all, don't read on.  Hmm... I dearly love all the characters in their own way. If I don't like a character, it's painfully obvious.   I try and give each important character a conflict or backstory, something to occupy their lives and keep the reader interested and caring about them. Take Alexei, for instance, who is probably the best example of this. He's had a rough life - he never knew his father and his mother ditched him with his artist uncle at a young age. I'm really not sure how much I'm going to reveal about anybody, because I might use some of this stuff in the second half. Alexei had to steal when he was younger, but not frequently... he developed a charming way and had decent manners. He was quite bright and motivated to become a good painter like his uncle was. Turned out to be a pretty good kid - enough for Violetta to come along and fall in love with him.   She likes his wild and his charming, shy side. She likes the wildly varying time she has with him and the whirlwind of doing something different than her boring, sheltered rich life.   Eventually they develop into the people they are (or were). Violetta is a bit more cynical due to her father's disownment and the sudden hardship she was forced into. Alexei is more stubborn, liking control, and more of a worrier/cynic. He never got the son he wanted, except for the one who was stillborn (and named after him). Still, Alexei and Violetta love each other exactly the way they did at the beginning of their courtship - they've just gotten used to each other... and how they've changed.  Aleks is used to being shunted away from the spotlight by her pretty, older, smarter, more talented, interested-in-art-and-her-father's-favorite sister. Only her mother really encouraged her, and she too had much time invested in Natalia. Natalia was the perfect one, and Aleks was just... Aleks. She doesn't know what she wants out of life yet or what SHE is really good at. She was brought up to believe what is worthwhile and she doesn't happen to be good at any of it. In the second half I'm going to explore more of what Aleks's talents are and how she'll use them in the future.  Natalia's flirtatiousness and secret daring got her into trouble. She's not sure if she's ready for marriage or children yet, or if Kamen is really even the one for her. She questions herself constantly. Meanwhile, she tries to keep of a facade of beauty and perfection, of respectability, when really she feels (and almost is) like trash. Still, she was brought up to have good manners and morals, and she has the right ideas. She just has to rise above what she's done to her life with poise and grace. This is a huge conflict for her.  The decision to kill Violetta was a last minute one. I worked around it for so long and decided it would be best for the story if she was killed. It would make Alexei's attempt at suicide make more sense. It would make the story go smoother. However, it did present a difficulty when deciding why Aleks would rush to Vlad's or why Vlad would even bother to go to Alexei. I'll try and get that explained here.   Vlad knows what happened to Natalia when she tried to step outside the box of her father's rules. He'd rather it not happen to Aleks, so he'd like to get Alexei's permission to have a relationship with Aleks and get that out of the way instead of getting Aleks and himself into trouble. Make sense? Yeah, I hope...   Vlad is also interesting to me, but also very difficult to write. He's smart and witty, and for some reason I'm terrible with comebacks unless I try to write in a very spontaneous way or edit something in later. Sometimes I do have little bursts of banter that I learned to discover in drama class, but that's not the point. He's hard to do.   He's also had a rather hard life - he never really knew his father except for a few brief, likable memories. Count Peter Kovachev was a pretty cool guy. His mother used to be really sweet before she lost her husband and went a little off the wall. Peter kept her under control, and now that's Vlad's responsibilty. He does not relish it - loves his mother but would rather her be a mother than someone hardly there.   For awhile, I considered that maybe there could be something between Natalia and Vlad. He probably liked her at some point and thought, in modern terms, that she was hot - but way out of his league because she was a couple years older. This was back at the beginning when he was just a conceited slacker.  I think Aleks was the one who helped him grow out of that. He realizes what a sweet, cool girl this is and gradually calms down in his quest to figure her out and come to the point of loving her. He also comes to realize that her animosity to him is really because of his attitude and he works to change that image she has of him. (Vlad's psyche is really hard to write as well.) He changes his self-destructive ways and decides he'd rather help others.   I think they're pretty suited for one another, though sometimes I wonder if a Natalia/Vlad thing would've been more spicy. Now, I think Vlad would really do anything for Aleks because he has so much loyalty to her and her family. He's gotten over his protective shell of indifference. Sonia he doesn't care for because she's boring. Aleks has opinions and things, and he likes that hidden, spunky potential she has. In the second half, I want to write about how Aleks's opinions and Vlad's opinions can collide because of their separate social classes. I don't think Vlad cares much for his wealth but will utilize it for his own purposes. I don't see him as having much loyalty to the government or rich people in general (as seen by his attitude to his grandparents). Yet he doesn't want to see Aleks get hurt for her anti-government thoughts.   Many comparisons can also be drawn from Aleks/Vlad and Violetta/Alexei. The beginning letters of the names, for one. Violetta and Vlad come from wealth, Aleks and Alexei from poverty. I think Aleks might come to Alexei for advice in instances where she and Vlad disagree. Aleks doesn't have her mother anymore (who she did confide in occasionally); Natalia is busy with her own family and only has some time to listen. So that leaves her with Alexei and Vlad.   The relationship between Aleks and her father is very crucial to the story, and I think it was Hillary who really pointed out that Alexei is the central character. A lot of things square back to him. He carries his presence even when not in the scene. He's a prominent figure. Alexei might be busier with conventions/exhibitions and traveling to them, but he'll still have a lot to do with his recent boom of commissions and such. He'll be around for Aleks when she needs him. The two will probably be a lot closer in the second half.   Aleks will carry many more responsibilities, ones that Natalia and her mother had previously and are no longer there to care for. Many of them involve making sure Alexei stays focused and takes care of himself. Organizing, paying rent, keeping the house up... everything. She'll balance her job, her relationship with Vlad, helping Natalia with her children, her house, and her father. To top it all off, developing a new talent.   Kamen was a minor, almost unseen figure in the first draft I wrote. I wrote him in as more of a character in the second. You'll see much more of him in the second half of the book. He's a drifter, a no-good, but he's motivated and ambitious. He realizes the mistake he's made with Natalia, but even if the marriage goes completely sour he'll work to fix it because he believes he can build out of anything. He's going to have love for his children enough to make things work, even if they aren't. It's going to be a painful, tough road, but it'll work out for him.   Wow. Um... can't think of anything else to ramble about at the moment. I'll shut up...
