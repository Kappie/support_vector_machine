You only know what's better when you've had something less.  am i doing this just so it'll never happen? we dream too hard, so the lovely, feathery figments of our imagination are so overtrodden that they cease to exist in their previous desirable forms. Charlie's right, we shouldn't think too much about things. The more we do, the worse they get, and everything ceases to be spontaneous, to be beter than dreams. Bret and the red car that didn't need to exist.
