Became so used to waking up late, lazily sipping coffee, showering before noon if that's what the fates decided, and if not, that was okay too, that the concept of "going back" seems foreign.  Back to what?  Isn't this what life is now?  Not so much, no.  But I love that I loved this break so much.  Very relaxing, very restful.  Everything a good break should be and more.  Will have two days before school begins to reconnect with my cute apartment with positive vibes...Yay.  Probably will get nasty with the plants, too.  Might even finish a book or two, never know!  Joe and I are braving the Boise route tomorrow morning.  Wonder if he'll make it home tonight before 12.  Wonder if he'll stop when I need to pee.  We've never left on the same day, so this whole caravan thing could be interesting, indeed.  The last time we traveled together, his car ended up needing $3,000 worth of repairs.  Hopefully being in separate cars will improve our record.
