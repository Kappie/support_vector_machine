Tonight was ok. I was supposed to go out with Erica, Brett, and this kid Roger, but it didn't end up happeneing so I just went to Joanne's instead. Heh. It was alright. We just watched the first Harry Potter movie, and Kathryn kind of ruined part of the fifth book for me. Sadly, I think se did it purposely. Like...the way she said it, and when she did it, it felt like she knew exactly what she was saying. Kelly and I obviously weren't too happy. Oh well. It was still ok. Everything with Diane is all good now! :) I'm so happy it is, because I just...I don't know, things were awkward for a bit I guess.  Man, everyone seems so aggravated and irritated lately. It's weird. It's like everyone needs a vacation from each other. Like everyone needs to get away. I don't know, it's just odd. Man, I wish my mommy were home. I need to talk to her about this decision I'm trying to make. I don't know. I kind of wish I had someone who I could talk to about this, but...there are very few people I trust, and even them, it's not easy to talk about people I like with...  I guess we'll see what happens. I'm thinking of making a list of why I like both, and then deciding, but that just seems so...I don't know. I feel like I should know. I feel like I should feel in my heart which one's right. I guess....  Who knows?  I think I just need sleep. I was absolutely looony five minutes ago haha. I guess I've gotten into serious conversation with the person I'm talking to so I've gotten more serious, but I love when I can be goofy. I love just feeling silly and not caring what other people think. Woooo.   Anyway, I think I'm just going to go to sleep soon, maybe read a few pages of my book. Not Harry Potter. Ahh....byebye! :)
