It was nice seeing Holli because I haven't seen her since school got out. It was also nice seeing Alex since I haven't seen her since Tuesday. My dear Chubbs! We just hung out and went swimming. Good stuff. Alex and I showed Holli the "fort" as well. I think Holli liked it. It was fun. Other than that, I really didn't do too much today. Tomorrow will be boring tho, but oh well.
