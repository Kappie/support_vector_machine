Ever since I first heard this song way back when and bought my very first Jeff Buckley cd I have been obsessed with the song.  For whatever reason, despite it's not so uplifting lyrics it has this amazing ability to just calm me and make me okay with things once again.  It's really amazing the power music has over me that one song can change my whole mood.   Hallelujah Jeff Buckley  Well I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do you? Well it goes like this : The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrough ya She tied you to her kitchen chair And she broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew ya I've seen your flag on the marble arch But love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  There was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Well, maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya It's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...
