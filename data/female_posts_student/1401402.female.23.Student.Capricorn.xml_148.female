OMG, I’m gonna miss the flight. Rush out of bed, ran straight towards the rest room, hop in the shower, got dress, check the time 8am. SHIT, I swear I was only in there for like 15 mins. Storm out of the house, down the stairs, into the car, drove out the drive way. Turn back to look for my luggage, damnit I left it at home. Ran out of the car knowing that the keys were in there and ran up the stairs grab my luggage and dash down the stairs and into the car again. Check the time 8:55 am, call me blonde but I have just missed my flight to las vegas. I got out of the car ran in circles and said to myself what should I do what should I do?   The alarm went off 6am, I woke up in fears, and I had to run around the house to check every single clock to make sure I wasn’t dreaming anymore. My heart was pounding like a racing popcorn popping machine. Shower, got dress, check luggage check, shoes check, clothes check, toothpaste and toothbrush check. Got everything okay I’m ready to roll. 7am picked up a couple of friends and off we went to Oakland airport.   The coolest thing about purchasing tickets online is that there are no waiting in line to clam your tickets. You go to this e ticket electronic machine (which looks like an atm machine btw), stick your credit card in, pop up a menu option and print your ticket. Cool huh?   Got on the plane I’m so exhausted.  Last nite was the hardest part of all time, I was tossing and turning, I was too excited to go to sleep, I had to take a nite quil so I could knock myself out. I slept like a baby. Maybe that was the reason why I had that stupid dream. I am on the plane right now!!! Gosh, I cant wait to get to get to Vegas, its gonna be so much fun, its gonna be one hell of a trip I’ll tell ya that. Let me just go crazy with the girl and party our ass off and forget our stupid problems. Those days are over baby. I heard the weather is gonna be real nice in vegas, in the 90°. Which is perfect for me because all I packed was shorts and tank tops, outrageous clothes, skimpy clothes oh ya know what I mean. 30 mins to go until we hit the soil of vegas. I cant wait to enjoy the nice warm weather and check out guys that I don’t even know.    May 30, 2004 @ 4:57 pm OMG, hang over hang over damnit, my headache wont go away.   Yesterday…Friday..28th of May.. We arrive at the airport took the taxi to Treasure Island, unpack and went out to eat. Then we walked around the strip the whole day. After walking for about five whole hours we return to the hotel, rest and got ready for dinner. We ate at Cesar’s steak house then went to palms RAIN in the Dessert. The club was cool, they played hip hop, techno, it was a mixed crowd, guys there were fine fine fine.    We gather everyone up and just drank, one shot after another within 30 mins we had like four shots already total. I was feeling alil tipsy. We dance on the center stage with water surrounding us where everyone in the club can see us, we were crazy that caught a lot of attention. Every now and then there would be these flame that pop out of no where from the ceiling like a fireball it was one amazing show.. While we were dancing, I spotted this guy across the water he had his eyes hooked on me and he kept toasting his drinks at me. He was pretty darn cute, an asian guy alrite Sakdary… He wore this black banana republic short sleeve button up shirt dark blue jeans with dress shoes. I was totally ignoring the other guys that have asked me to dance.   I walked off to the bar and there he was asking me for my permission if he could buy me a drink. I didn’t understand why a handsome guy like him would even look at a girl like me. I mean I was hanging out with girls who have large nice beautiful breast, very attractive who were models and strippers and me, I didn’t have anything to flash… we were talking for awhile, his name was Joshua, from santa cruz, he seems to be very nice, and he was a great dancer. I thought to myself this is vegas of course everyone is gonna be nice just to get laid. We dance for awhile and he gave me his room number and his phone number. I took it and toss it away at the end of the night.     The girls and I didn’t leave the club until 5 am, got to the hotel slept until 9am, got ready for the new day.. Walked around the strip again then ran into Josh. I try to ignore him by running off but he followed me. We talked for a lil bit he told me to call him then we split. Later on that night we went to mirage, had dinner and did alil gambling. Then ran into josh again. Dude, why cant I get away from this guy? I swear vegas is a huge place, is he stalking me? This time he wont go away damnit. So we all decided to go clubbing together. Opium was the club, it was jumping. Some how josh wanted to get close but every time he moved too close I move away. We party until 5 am again. After that nite I didn’t see josh anywhere around again. Which was great and that’s how I wanted it.    Sunday May 30, 2004 @ 4:45 pm Woke up this morning, packed got ready to check out. Leaving the hotel room and walked towards the elevator. Got down stairs and guess who have been waiting for me in front of the elevator… JOSH,.. What on earth was he thinking? Didn’t he get the clue from last nite? We end up having breakfast together and went shopping. Some guys just don’t get it do they? We went to Hawaiian palace, it was nice, and it was beautiful. I was looking at these beautiful pink diamond bracelet but I couldn’t afford it because I had lost all my money to the damn slots..it was a hundred I figured I can do a lot more to a hundred then getting the bracelet.   Josh asked me if I liked it and I said of course I do but its too expensive for me to buy. I walked away and look at some other stuff. Josh came back with the bracelet in his hand.. This should have been the part where I should kiss the guy but instead I kept telling him I cant take it I cant take it. it was sweet of him to get something so expensive for me. I try to refuse but he said this is something that you wanted and I see it in your eyes, wore the bracelet for me and said beautiful piece of jewelry goes together with a beautiful lovely woman like yourself then kissed my hand. At that point my heart melted, I didn’t know what to say.   My time in Vegas was up I had to head out to the airport. Josh walked me and another girlfriend to the airport then we split. All I gave was a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I have his number and all but I don’t think I want to call this guy.. He’s too fine for me. He might be a player and break my heart. I don’t want to take that risk. I’m not going to call him, I’m gonna loose his number after I leave Vegas. Overall the trip was great, I drank so much nite and day, it didn’t really matter because all I had to pay for each drinks are like a dollar. Gambling was cool and all but I realized that Sunday wasn’t my night to gamble. I had so much fun!!! that was just what I really needed. Lets just keep it that way...for now…until next year…
