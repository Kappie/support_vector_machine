I saw the final lord of the rings movie on sunday nite. It was fantastic! I neva thought id like lotr but i do. The only part i didnt like was the last half an hour or wateva it was, it was kinda boring but i was told that it was a very shortened version so i guess thats gd. Im going 2 c itagain wit mez this sunday nite so if ne1 wants 2 come, who reads my blogs u r very welcome. I guess i could go in2 detail and talk about the movie in depth wise and wateva but that would be a bit boring 4 me and prolly 4 those of u who r reading right now. I have 2 work 2moro which means pretty much no new years eve celebration, not that i really celebrate it by getting drunk and all that like a lot of ppl my age. I think ill just think back on the past year. Ive missed ppl this year, mainly Fiona and Lewis bcoz they now go 2 boarding skool, but i have missed otha ppl, who i saw almost evryday at skool. I hate 2 admit it but i miss petra, well i dont actually miss her but i miss the friendship we had last year b4 Josh entered our lives. He came between a lot of things in my life, but i cant blame him, he neva realised wat was happening. I wish so much that i could turn back the clock 2 the beginning of last yr. i was relatively happy then, well most days neway. I believed  all my friends cared then, unlike now where i have lost so much faith in them, well not all of them there r exceptions and those who read this r told if they r an exception. Im just generalizing. Im trying not 2 use names but it helps sumtimes if i do.  That was 1 long paragraph. Ne ways i was almost about 2 write about feeling like a lost soul but i wont. Ill try and have sum cheerfullness in this blog. The lyrics below i feel describe wat i think inside my head now days.  Behind Blue Eyes- Limp Bizkit  no one knows what it’s like  to be the bad man  to be the sad man  behind blue eyes   and no one knows  what it’s like to be hated  to be faded to telling only lies   chorus  but my dreams they aren’t as empty  as my conscious seems to be  i have hours, only lonely  my love is vengeance  that’s never free  no one knows what its like  to feel these feelings  like i do, and i blame you!   no one bites back as hard  on their anger  none of my pain woe  can show through  chorus   discover l.i.m.p. say it (x4)  no one knows what its like  to be mistreated, to be defeated  behind blue eyes  no one know how to say  that they’re sorry and don’t worry  i’m not telling lies  chorus   no one knows what its like  to be the bad man, to be the sad man  behind blue eyes.  Im not realloy a fan of limp bizkit but this song is so different 4 them. Neways off i go, buh bye.
