I think there should be some fundamental truths put on the table before I digress my point: firstly, we've been through a lot, whereas I've not with Becca. Second, despite how biased some of the accounts may have been, and despite all the bullshit floating around about this whole story, I'm inclined to believe against Becca, and this mostly correlates with point number three, you  are  my friend, and I'm pretty sure that I speak for all of us when I say that we certainly won't turn on you; and at the very least,  I  will not.   It's an interesting concept, Becca is fronting for the war and we're drafting the peace treaty. I can't really feel nice towards Becca since I feel like she's tried to get to me a few times...but I guess I'll put on my best face and try to do this painlessly. Slowly all the roles we act out become our identity, and in the end we are what we pretend to be. It may be that you've had a part in turning us, but we made the last decision to turn angst against her.  If there can't be peace, then let's call it a stalemate.
