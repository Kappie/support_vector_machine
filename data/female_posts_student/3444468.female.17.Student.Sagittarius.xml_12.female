I actually wish that I was in that car accident and that I had died. I don't care. I can't live for another minute with that selfish idiot. The guy goes on and on and how I don't appreciate every fucking little thing that he and Mom did for me. Of course I fucking do. Why do you think that I don't cuss you out every fucking second I see you? I do to myself but not out loud. That's why I hate Korean Christian parents. They make you think that they want the best for you but all they want is to look good in front of their friends and show off to people. That's the only fucking reason they want me to be a doctor. I hate him. I love my Mom but I hate my father. He's a freaking asshole. He's so damn obnoxious that I don't even see how he doesn't annoy himself.   "I'm going to throw you out when you're 18". See if I care. In 5 years the only  parent  that I will be talking to is Mom. I don't give a fuck about you. I just wish he would fucking leave me alone. Just go away! I wish I was in that car accident. I wish I was dead. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go to university. I don't want to live another day in this hellhole you call "home". I just don't want to live anymore.
