I got up at around 11am. and Ryan wanted me to go to the lake and it took about 1 hr. to get a hold of my mom to ask her. When she said yes Liz to me to Ryans and we left to go to the lake. When we got there we helped his Grampa on his new boat. His Grampa calls me CHERIO because he cant say my name.     But anyways...me and Ryan and his little sister all went swimming in the lake and he was throwing up off his shoulders it was way fun. Then Amber left so it was just me Ryan and this huge lake. So we got all close and started kissing and telling eachother that we love them, and it was so romantic.     His uncle sent us to Wal-Mart to get a fishing net. Then Ryan started to catch bait and we needed a bucket to put the bait so me and Ryan took the golf cart to the property they own and we stayed down there for a lil while "looking" for a bucket. lol. yeah  we kissed.....alittle....    Then on the way back to the house I wanted to drive the cart so Ryan let me and we were being goofy and I went to go on this little off ramp and Ryan was like "No we have to get back!" so I swerved the cart and almost landed in this ditch were there was spikes in it. If you think that is bad wait til I tell you what happend after that. We were back at the house and I was going through this little short cut and as I pasted in front of his aunts house (she has this tree and flowers all around with bricks surrounding it)so I hit the bricks thus making me hit all her flowers. Nobody was around so I hoped out of the cart and made it look normal agian. So know Ryan wont let me drive the cart anymore...wonder why Iam a great driver....hrmmm...     Then we went and we at hot dogs with chili and then we went home. On the ride home I sat close to Ryan and layed down on his leg and I talked to him for a while and then I ended up falling asleep. We got to my house at around 11:30pm and I tried to get him to stay but my mom said no. So he left. Then when he got home he called me and we talked until 2am or so. So yeah that was my day and it was FUN! hehe...
