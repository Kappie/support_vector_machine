And Paola was actually crying today...:(I've never seen her cry poor thing. Everyone is leaving. Everyone is going to different High Schools next year. This week so far hasn't been going well...in 4th when paola was crying i went to go give her a hug then i started tearing up and i was like 'this is too much' so i sat back down and went back to work. Then in 5th..me and ryan were partners for the Japanese Dialog thing and we were writing in japanese when i just start crying for some reason...i just..put my head down. Grr..i tried so hard not to.   *i hope everyone in WV has a grand 'ol time in DC*-and when you get back...i  might be on the road to sarasota...depending on if you get back on friday or saturday.  Sadness
