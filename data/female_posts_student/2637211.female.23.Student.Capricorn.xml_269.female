See, pregnant ladies can't lift ANYTHING, so because I'm a selfless sister, I offered to hurt my back and fill in on the heavy lifting. Fortunately for me, but sadly for them, I can't go up to Humbolt with them to help with that end of lifting.   Also, in the course of helping them move, I met their new kitten they were taking care of, and I decided, after much consideration, to bring her home. Right now she and Judy are coming to some sort of kitty agreement, and I kind of want to name the kitten Pantelones, or maybe Pam. I'm just not sure, but it does need to be slightly ironic and weird. What about Iris? I'm feeling the old lady names....  As to the previous post; I had so much fun hanging out and chatting with Liz H. I really missed her, and visiting reminded me of how lonely I am for close female friends. A boyfriend is nice, but should not replace girlfriends at all. Discuss.
