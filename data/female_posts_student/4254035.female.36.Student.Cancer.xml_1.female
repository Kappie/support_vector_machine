And I know friends will be v. grateful too b/c they will no longer get personal rants in the middle of the night due to lack of sleep. Does anyone else find their mind clearer at this time of day????  Anyway, b/c it won't last long, I might as well admit to having a boyfriend (see fav books - not like I didn't do my homework on this one). He's way smarter than me and hopefully will never find this site! He's too busy doing chemistry or whatever . . . I used to work in the arts so what do I know???  My father used to ask me when I was going to get over my hobby (arts) and get a real job. I guess the answer is NOW, since I am returning to school to get some classes done that should have been executed many, many moons ago and THEN hopefully joining the proletariat at large. Blue used to be my fav color but by necessity it has slowly evolved to green.  I have other friends who blog too. They seem to have very deep thoughts and a lot more synapses firing than me. I wasn't sure how I made it through a normal day. After reading some of their stuff, I'm kinda afraid for them now . . . :) But I don't want this to be just a diary of what I ate for breakfast and how many visits to the loo I make. Times are a changin' my friends and we better too. My best advice is to read, read, read LIKE THINGS ON PAPER and make it a point to listen to everything around you. It's going in your ears whether you like it or not. You might as well make a point of making opinions over it. We only live once my friends and that's not just a phrase. Ask anyone who has lost someone the desperately and dearly loved. Pet each moment as you experience it, b/c by it's nature we can't hold onto time . . . we can only cherish it as it passes by.  Friend of mine is going to play at Piatt Park tomorrow from 11:30 am - 1:30 pm. Janet Pressley and she rocks. Anyone in downtown Cincinnati - make it a point to come and hear her! Off to bed and hopefully to sleep, per chance, to dream . . .  But just before I leave, I'd better not get any flaming emails or posts about the title of this blog. I'm sorry if I may not be as sophistacated and "dictionary" as y'all are but at least it's the truth. I'm not trying to fancy anything up. Not to mince words but, life is life and alot of it isn't all that nice. We're all trying to hang tough together. Keep that mustard seed of faith :) And when you have to, just "bitch and moan" with the rest of us b/c one thing you will know - you are not alone.
