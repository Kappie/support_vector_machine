I'm eating cold french fries, i'm disgustingly sweaty, i have to fart, my room smells like cat pee, i am failing several classes, and i smell. But i am insanely happy.  I LOVE MUSIC! it is better than peeing on someone you hate and ice cream and rain and shows combined. It makes you fast, free, and happy.  it makes me sad that dylan "isnt a punk anymore." i mean... i love him so much... but i'm just 16 and i still want to be insane and do stupid things and get my ass kicked and dress all stupidly and think that i rock... and itd kick so much ass if he did too. when im with him i feel like i should grow up or be grown up and... i dont know. Do something productive and good. which may be a good thing, i dont know. ::shrug:: i love him more than anything and everything, more than music... its just i wish i would have known him when he was all punk rock and less of a geek. We wouldve had so much fun together... *punk rock love.* (haha...)  and he loves geekdom lots...  sometimes a lot more than me....  my hands smell like beer.  ::shrug::  im tired. and i smell. I love coming home from shows and smelling and being SO dirty yet it is the most awesome thing ever. but even though i feel awesome, i still have to shower.  abby
