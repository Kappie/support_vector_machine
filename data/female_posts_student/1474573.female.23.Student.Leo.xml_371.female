Anyhoo, he loves to cook and they made a spread so good I felt like I was in a restaurant.  A nice, romantic restaurant with candles and everything!  Aww.  I felt so special!      Anyhoo, we had a yummy salad with candied walnuts, raisins and blue cheese (and I don't normally like blue cheese but this worked for me), yummy pumpkin ravioli in black truffle oil and yummy braised oxtail...for dessert, a yummy peach cobbler.   mmmmm...      ----       On another note, on the Diaz Family front, we are STILL fighting and I'm convinced my brother just FINDS ways to make problems and starts fights.  (sigh)  Since homicide is not an option, I just have to sit and wait for the day when we close on the house and he's out of my life.
