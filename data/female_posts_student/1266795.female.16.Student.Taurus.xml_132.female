(Seriously Jonah, it gets better than the door of the jail about 80 pages in.) I still have to type up my journal entries though. *bleh* Well, I must put this in. You all know how Ali has been leading the Quote of the Day scores? Not any more! She is now second to...*drumroll* NATHAN! :-D  Scores are as follows:  Nathan: 990 Alison: 900 Michael: 520 Sarah and Marten: 470 Olivia: 460 Jonah: 320 Evan: 160 So yeah. Your new quote is Dum spiro, spero.  Interesting one. Anyone in French might be able to make the connection between the verbs and some French verbs, but I don't know.  Sarah unexpectedly stopped by today, which was nice. I was thinking about going to see her this week, and I still might.  I can't believe that there's only 1 month and 5 days until school. Okay, I'm a dork, and I am looking forward to it.  AND I figured out how I am going to get my money for IB. Hello! I have two flutes upstairs that I never ever use anymore. I am going to sell them and get some money. Now, I have no clue what I am going to do senior year to come up with my money then, but that's okay. I should be able to get about $400 for my flutes, so that should be good. Senior year though, there's no way that I am selling my last flute. That would be like giving away my life. And as much as I despise that oboe, it is a challenge that needs to be conquered. (My new goal: To play the fugue in public on the oboe by senior year. Without passing out, lol. My oboe teacher seemed to think that I am going to pass out one of these days.) So yeah. That is my next project: Finding a place that buys instruments. I know Paiges does sometimes, I might try there. Ah well. Another battle for another day.   "I've been rejected...twice!"
