Okay so yesturday, Dacia said she had a dream where she smoked, I just got a spur of the moment thing and stole one of my dad's that was lying in a pack on the ground. I don't know aht came over me! So last night at 1 in the morning we smoked it. I feel so bad, I don't wanna grow up and act out like that, I still want to be a little girl. But I know I can't I can't tell my mom either, this is killing me, though it's so small a deal. I just feel so sick inside. I keep telling myself it's not a big deal, she did it in the 8th grade. I just feel really unsure of the situation. I just want it to end
