(bought for me by my mum,   I would never buy it by my own choice) 'Maximum taste, No sugar' My arse...  I think, if you were on a diet, you wouldn't be drinking a large amount of fizzy drinks... Full of calories. "Diet ones aren't" I hear you say... Maybe not, but they contain a whole load of fake crap to substitute the sugar, and as a result, taste disgusting. hence the Diet Dr Pepper picture. Dr Pepper is perhaps the greatest drink ever created,  diet  Dr Pepper, tastes like shit. If I was ever on a diet, I just wouldn't bother. Surely if you were serious, you'd be drinking fruit juice, and water. There was even that news report about something in Diet Coke possibly causing cancer, proving the fact it's full of fake crap. A friend of mine (and I hope she won't be offended) drinks diet stuff all the time, she says its so she doesn't get fat or whatever, she's perfectly fine anyway, but what would a can of normal coke do? Seriously? Just drink normal stuff! It tastes so much better and doesn't contain crappy sugar substitutes!
