There's a "Xuang Zhou" whom I'm not sure is me or not.  -____-;;  so..  gotta go ask mrs walker about that tomorrow!  whoohoo.  I hope it is me... then I can rub it in chuan's face (even though he made it, too.)  AND there's a freaking TXML thing tomorrow after school...  so I'm not sure if I should go to that or go to the make up bio lessons.  probably bio....  and I gotta take home the bio project!  like... soon!  egads.  it's been sitting there FOREVER...  -sweatdrop-  hmm... still gotta go do bio hw and french hw.  will probly just study tonight and do the hw tomorrow morning... haha.  me and my procrastinating.  I am good.  commapps was especially stupid today.  lisa and jack know my pain.  I gotta study study study!  gah!  I went to jackie's house today and baked mint brownies!  they were super yummy.  =)  I think they turned out v. well.  and it's a good thing ppl don't actually see us making them... or else no one would eat them.  hehehe.  ;-)  lol.  now... I gotta go study.  whoohooo~  ++sunny
