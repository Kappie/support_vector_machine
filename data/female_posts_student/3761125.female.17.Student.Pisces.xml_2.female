I really thought I was all recovered and I've finally lost almost all the weight from the stupid disorder but for the past week, everything's come back... I've been slightly able to fight it off though but it comes when I'm under stress... I can't think of anything wrong right now.   I probably don't even make any sense.  Something that did bother me today though was when my uncle came over.  He was like "Sarah, lose the eye makeup."  For some reason that bothered the hell out of me.  I like it, so accept it.  I just hate it when people comment on how others look.    I wish someone was at least around.  I don't like being alone right now.
