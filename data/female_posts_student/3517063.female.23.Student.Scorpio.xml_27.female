There is something very wrong with the newly redesigned (first redesign since 1981) US army uniform:     First of all, it doesn't look like it's any sort of camouflage, particularly not for anywhere that's green. Second, as this next picture shows, it looks like a cheap hunting outfit you'd find at a Michigan Kmart, designed to make you stick out in a forest, rather than blend in:     In fact, the only thing this uniform provides camouflage for is a stormy sky or perhaps a desert. Which leads me to a slightly alarming conclusion - this uniform was not designed to provide cover in greenery, because the US army won't be fighting anywhere green for a long time. Looks like we're in the Middle East for the long haul, at least if these new uniforms are any indication.
