Don't need to worry about my feelings, or with people calling me. About excuses not to see people. About sex. About hormones. About the guy I'm falling in a hole over.   The week is over And I'm glad it's done Now I can stop pulling off This show to everyone   Certain people "vanadilized" my blog. It's like rape. It feels unclean, dirty, and the only way I can think of cleanizing it is starting a new blog. Which isn't going to happen.  Lost my train of thought, Ruth called. What a great woman.
