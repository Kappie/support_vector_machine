Woke up at 9:30 this morning only to realize that my gym buddy was grounded, and that I couldn't gather up enough courage to go it alone in the cold, sweaty and very unfamiliar territory.  So, what did I do all day?  I cleaned. I slept a few hours this afternoon, woke up when my mom came in, and shipped out to Grossmont to meet some buddies for "Farenheit 9/11".  The 7:30 was, of course, sold out, so we bought tickets for the 10:15 show and grabbed dinner at Chevy's Mex.  I saw some old friends, who were great fun to chill and boosted my social confidence level a bit.  The movie theater then restored most confidence in the La Mesa community- so many liberals in one place, and you know what?  I literally knew a third of them all personally, including one older cousin. Once again, Michael Moore impresses me beyond belief.  A brilliant film, if ever there was, and I attach to it a frantic thumbs up and unadulterated recommendation.  Powerful, dude.
