It made me want to swim circles around and around them. I guess I didn't learn to swim properly til I was about six...oh, wait. they'renine and eleven...  i also sawdaniel, who is my hot neighbor who doestriathalons and i have been madly in love with since I MOVED HERE! well, i've got to go. i'm already looking uphomecoming dresses. hopefully,the whole thing won't be a replay of the sadie hawkins dance...hehe...megan, u know what i mean. i just...won'tdance with frankie...that's all. HA! like icould ever avoid that.
