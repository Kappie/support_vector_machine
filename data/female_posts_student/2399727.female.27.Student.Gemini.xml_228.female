It certainly was not the end of the road by any means.  Actually, today marks the end when I think of it.  It is a year to the day of the surgery and I was told that after a year, my retina would be as fully healed as it ever will be.  I can safely do air travel again.   The wrinkles are ironed out for the most part.  That doesn't mean that the road ahead won't have bumps but hopefully, they will be just tiny potholes like this vitreous detachment.  My two closest friends (unfortunately, I don't mean that from a geographical point of view!) are moving and beginning the first day of the rest of their lives today. I wish both E. and M. the very best and I hope that they find every happiness in their new lives.  More to come...
