At least I didn't really have to pick out anything to wear.  Chorus competition all day long at Meredith.  I think we did ok.  Everyone was like "Oh, my God, we did terribly!"  But it really went about like I thought it would.  Can't expect too much more.  Joncie was pissed off because we didn't get to have anything to eat and she had to stay at Enloe until like 6.  But I was ok with it.  Ashley and I were singing and being silly on the way back to school, which was pretty funny.  My mother actually remembered to pick me up at 3.  We went to Helios, and I got a cookie.  Dina didn't charge us, even she probably should make my mother pay.  Now, I really need to do some work.  Like, real bad.  I totally neglected everything last night. Oh, goodness.  I just remembered that I told Mr. Kifner I would come see him about Marx tomorrow.  Ughh.  I could skip it, but I really shouldn't.  Test Monday, and I need to start at least pretending to care.  I best be off.
