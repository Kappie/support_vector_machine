Im tired I had to sleep on a love seat last night. Has anyone ever tried to sleep on a love seat before? It's fucking impossible. I went to a fair yesterday. It was so much fun. I wanted to stay forever and eat leftover fair food and ride the rides all day. I KNOW its not possible, I know you people who make things boring would say so. The only memories I have now are the bruises on my back from the fair rides. Im here at this other land, with limited internet accesss. It sucks. Its a big suckfest. God, Im such a loser with no friends. I wish I had friends. I get crazy sometimes, Im not sure if I do. But I wish that I could meet someone, like a special someone who Id be eternally happy with. There was a camel at the fair, a CAMEL! And this girl at Subway was wearing yellow pants with purple socks, like she was trying to be spontaneous.   LOOK AT ME IM SPONTANEOUS! BOW TO MY SPONTANIETY!   I wish that I could die, like by cancer. Then I would know when I would die and I wouldnt have to be afraid of dying without my knowlege. Unless, a freak accident happens, you cant ever be prepared for those. Im an immature person.
