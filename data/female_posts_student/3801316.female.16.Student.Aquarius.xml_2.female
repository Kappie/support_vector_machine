But of course,I hadto attend.   Armed with a cute outfit and a charming smile, a pretty hairdo and an armload of hip dance moves, i headed to the gym trying not to pay much attention to the rainy weather, determined to make the most of the night to come.  As usual, my musician batchmates began the event with Christiansongs. After the guestspeakers, games, intermissionnumbers (our Jumpin' Jumpin' /Stomp to the Beat number was the supreme best) and dinner, the most awaited part of the night finally came.  There'snot much tosay about the dancing part naman since predictable na yun.  One thing that definitely fuelled my smile engine for the night is this, ahem, certain guy. To announce his name is to ruin his diskarte(and mine too)so I'll leave him anonymous nalang.   If you're reading this, you might be smiling. Don't worry, I'm smiling wtih you.  I entitled this 6 hours well spent kasi... self-explanatory, duh! I guess it doesn't really matter at all where you're going and what you're going to do coz as long as you're with fun people, everything's going to be fine.  In this case, everything turned out to be great.
