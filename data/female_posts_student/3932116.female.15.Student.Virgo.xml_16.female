I started band immediately monday and i've had that everyday, not to mention Muny band, and tomorrow i have registration for school, and then my grandparents 50th anniversary gig. BLAH! i'm so tired, and yet i can't sleep. strange world we live in, huh? well, there's not a whole lot goin on..i'm pretty bored as a matter of fact, but eh, i thought i would put my 2 cents in...me and jess drove around last nite, and talked...talked...talked. it was really good. missing old times..wanting a new start...new faces...new friendships, i don't know, just wanting to start over from last year. it was nice tho...well, i guess that's it..i'm out, g'nite!
