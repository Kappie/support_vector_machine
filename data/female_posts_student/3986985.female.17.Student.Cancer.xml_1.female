The Cumlasoc... ever prestigious and DARNED NASTY, has told the world that i got a crush on aaron... a bisexual nymphomaniac and ever trustworthy bitch blockhead of our class! The thing is, i don't have anything on that guy/gay... and if you happen to see his face when he heard the news...I very much ashamed actually... if it happens to be any other guy, i wouldn't be very much agitated,  but THE HELL!!! IT'S AARON!!! i almost throw up!!! I'm sorry if i'm too hard on this... but this is how i really feel... he's not even good-looking... I hope FF is reading this... 'cause i swear... i'm bound to avenge myself for that!!! Also for my very cute and lovable friend SHAZERU FUUMA, better watch out girl... you're in this too...  Anyway, i made another blog today... but i'm not telling you (especially FF) my URL... the things in there are highly confidential and down-to-earth sentimental...  I don't have any money left, and i'll soon be out on the streets... starving...  I'm alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone and alone... and it's only noon...   I had a sausage for BRUNCH, that's all i can afford rightnow...  I sew my dresses...T-shirts and pants that needs sewings (can you believe i know hoe to sew?)  I also need to do my laundry(then what am I doing here?)  I need to come up with a thesis statement for my report...  I need to review for my exam in Math...  I need to look for a laptop...  I need to E-mail my Dad...  I need to...  END THIS...   BYE!!  DARNED FF AND FUUMA...I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME!!!
