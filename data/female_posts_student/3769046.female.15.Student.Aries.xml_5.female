Altho the original plan was to watch 'a cinderella story.' But resulted into four people watching 'the notebook.' And the rest (12) watched 'a cinderella story.' First went to the washroom. Thus making us a little late to the movie. Was dark. Freakin' person scared me. But at least he hurt himself in the process, hah. So went in. Somehow ended up in a retarded position. But then someone took someone's spot. So I guess it was pretty okay. So previews for some movies. Tennis. We started talking about tennis, and how we suck so badly. Hahaha. Then yu-gi-oh. Woohoo, we're gonna watch yu-gi-oh in august! What fun. Then more previews and talking about weird things. I think we talk too much w/ each other. Seriously, I think we do. Bleh.So movie started. Saw castle, started talking about housing, hah. Then more talking. Movie was pretty okay. Felt a little claustrophobic at times. He kept nudging. But it was okay. Just laughed a lot. I was pretty content where I sat. Two fun people to be w/.Lmao, laughed at such retarded parts. Called so many people ugly in the movie, that was crazy and fun.    after movie:  Went to the arcade place. Got in trouble, wasn't our fault. Hah.So yeah. Waited for the people watching 'the notebook.' Took hella long. But finallywe were all re-united..*rolls eyes* So divided ourselves into four teams. Bowling was okay. Dunno if I ever would go bowlingagain. Hah. So time passed quickly. Was alittle too close to me. My god, this summer. A little too freakin' close to me!   after bowling: Then wentback to silvercity. Saw my aunt. Some two people were discussing about their movies. My god, I bet she hates me for interrupting them. I don't know if she's still denying that she likes him, 'cuz it's so obvious. My goodness. So many people these days are in denial. Quite sad actually. So some people stayed and watched 'dodgeball.' And others went to richmond center. But first we went to subway. Then got on the bus. Took a long time to get to richmond center. Haha, so much debates. That was funny. Then went to td canada trust. Then finally to richmond center. Bought and ate food. Walked around a little. Met up w/ the other people again. Then went home. Overall, today was pretty fun.
