BTW, we stay up pretty late now.. I wait for Brian to get off work and he doesn't get off until after midnight.. So you can call me. (ps. I think the official title is "THAT YANKEE DOODLE DANDEE")  Check out this article..  "Harry and Sally go to a Motel"  from Leg Manila.. What about you guys?  Do you have any interesting "motel" stories?
