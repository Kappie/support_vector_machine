MBC2010: u don't compete with ur brother?  if you speak german.. im sorry. lol and nora prolly wouldnt want me posting this but eh thats ok  virgogurl4: woof woof spaceypiXiechick: meeeow virgogurl4: jose ist heiss und er ist gut mit seinen Finger.   um thats enough. lala. ok so ive decided i want a tattoo on the inside of my lip.. one on the back of my neck (barcode a la dark angel :P) and one in that area by ur hip that dips. yaaay.  hah. except not because i actually dont like tattoos.. but mostly cause they stretch! anyway. im also in need of a bellybutton ring.  and eyebrow ring.. or anti-eyebrow. too bad you cant have those in the corporate world :( *nods* yeah... dont ask i have some weird obsessions.  Today I was in a bad mood.  Discussions with Jose, however, made me realize that the quality of my life is generally dictated by the quality of my relationships.  This is a very bad thing because I have many an unhealthy relationship.  Sitting in the car on the way home from track, I realized that there are so many things I absolutely adore that have NOTHING to do with shitty friends.    DISCLAIMER: This is a really long, boring list.  It makes me happy though, so you can just eat me.  I love... Running in the rain.   Waking up with a dog in your arms. Waking up with a dog next to you in a makeshift noose (curtain string thingee) Candy corn, conversation hearts, pixi stix, and Dunkaroos frosting. Jumping. Up and down... Off of things... To get a rebound...On people... Into sand pits... And hanging with the crazy retardedly cool jumper kids. Miniskirts. Wheat thins and four leaf clovers given to you by otherwise stiff coaches. Closets. Finally getting your ears pierced at age 15. Hot chocolate at 6 AM.   Waking up at 3 AM to get a glass of orange juice.  Believing that your TV is going to murder you and that the fridge is possessed(like in the Ring) once downstairs. Writing terrible poetry. Writing narcissitic blog entries. Writing. Being a girl with chickenscratch handwriting. Dyeing your hair fifty-million different colors... only to have it turn out red every time. No one understanding you--yourself included. Reading trashy teen magazines in purple tinted bubblebaths. Indie movies, chick flicks, bad horror movies, good horror movies, raunchy comedies, and ZOMBIE movies. Laying outside and just staring up at trees until you forget you even exist. Halloween. Listening to really terrible music and loving it.  Country.  Spice Girls.  Techno.  Cheesy 80s rap.  pOp-PuNk. EMO! Trying to bake people yummy cookies and failing miserably. Feeding people in general. Weight lifting. Having an awesome brother you can brag about. Having a ****ing psycho family in general. Thrifting. Subway workers knowing exactly what sub you want. The smell of track.  Not the lobby, though. Shoes.  Kitten heels, ugly shoes, mary janes, sneakers, track spikes, flip-flops, slippers.  Stealing your mom's shoes. Nauseatingly bright colors.  Preferably combined with an equally nauseating cartoon character. Pot-bellied pigs, teacup poodles, and huge slobbery Great Danes. VH1. Biology.  Discovery Health Channel.  Neurology.   Knowing that you're going somewhere.  In life that is.      I like how that list really turned into a train of happy thoughts.    also, HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELLA!!!! Well, belated.  Girl... you rock. :) :) :) Also, you're probably the only person i would ever say anything as retarded as "girl, you rock." to.  which is good maybe? someday i will write more about ellas coolness.
