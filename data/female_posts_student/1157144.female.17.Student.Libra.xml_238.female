(this gives you a hint as to what the answer to that question on my quiz might be.) anyway, as far as break goes, i am going to vegas/arizona from sat-tues and i would like to be in town thursday evening for a particularly good acoustic set, but i can miss that depending on what goes down. preferably, anything that fri-sun would be good, but yeah, we'll see.  as for capture the flag, that sounds fun. i got my new shoes today! yay!
