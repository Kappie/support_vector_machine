It doesn't matter anyways, because whether I aced or failed it, I'm getting a B anyways. It kind sucks, because I was sure I was gonna get an A. One freakin' test score screwed my grade. Whatever, I tried. Who cares, anyways it's not like my patients are gonna ask me, "Oh, what did you get in Anatomy?" Screw it!! I should be happy with my B, considering the class average was 68%. Hahaha..... I did it! Finally, it's over. I'm getting plastered this weekend to celebrate. hehe.... I've been waiting for this day. I'm gonna party like there ain't no tomorrow!! Wooo-Hooo I'm so glad Melissa didn't have her baby yet. I would have been so preoccupied with the baby, I probably wouldn't have even pulled off a B, had she had the baby.
