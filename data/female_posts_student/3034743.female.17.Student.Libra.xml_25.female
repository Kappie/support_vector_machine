It was boring, but looking back on the day, it seemed to have gone pretty well. In Spanish, I was the only one to get a 100% on our quiz...so that was cool. I took a test in calculus today, and I think I did ok. Computers was boring, as always. Psychology was kind of uneventful as well. Physics, we didn't do much. I was done testing my pendulum experiment, so I just talked the whole class time. It was fun. Then we had an assembly on drugs...that was boring. Today I wore my  Kiss Me, I'm Irish  shirt! I got two offers...Steven and Holli. Haha. I showed people my prom pics, and they all said they were cute. Tommy said I looked pretty in them, so that was cool too. I tried to show Ryan the pics today, figuring he'd like to see them since he was in them, but I guess I was wrong. He could have cared less. That is what makes me mad about Ryan. He annoys me all the time, and I'm finding myself disliking him more and more. Pretty soon it's going to get to the point where I wont care, and I'll just let our friendship fall apart. Whatever. I'm going to go shopping with Tera later today, so that should be fun. I don't have too much homework, I just have to study for a physics test....nothing TOO terrible. Hmm...that is really all about my day, so I think I'll be wrapping this up now.  SIDE NOTE: The song We Used To Be Friends by The Dandy Warhols is a good song. I like some of the lyrics:  Now everybody needs some time And everybody knows The rest of the lines In everybody else's show
