I wanted to ask Lauren to goto movies wit me but she neva home lol and she read dis shit wow. But yea I found out I MIGHT be moving in August but it's still a chance Ill stay here. I can get a job for a telemarketer that will be off the heezay callin niggas up to annoy the hell out of em.  I am soo scared because I can get suspeneded for gettin kicked out of a detention but I havnt been called yet but im still scared :( o well wat happens happens. Pce  El Jay
