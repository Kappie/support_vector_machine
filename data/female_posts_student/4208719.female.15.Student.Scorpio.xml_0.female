My snare is mad at me, and now I don't get a cool Drumline uniform anymore, but it felt so weird being away from my instrument. General band camp news-- We have our first show in the bag, well it needs polishing, but we have it. FYI - we do 4 or 5 complete shows every season, and for our first game (next friday) we have four songs and we have drills for 3. And that doesn't count pregame.
