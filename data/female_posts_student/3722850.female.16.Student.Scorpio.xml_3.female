I called nick yesterday and as soon as i said the way i felt he completley understood,it was great. he said he would never stop having feelings for me, but that we should just wait it out and see how things go from here. i think thats only the truth. So we're willing to wait, both of us. and things feel great again.            Today i went to a show, where one of my fav bands were playing, once again awesome! lol jake was all like hi, and well the rest of the band were out of it, it was so hot inside that place.      emmm and now i am just lounging around doing nothing, well maybe i might help my mom garden, if not go in my room like always and be boring cause i just find that oh so much fun.                                               life goes on. .
