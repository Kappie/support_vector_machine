You can customize all your own makeup, face wash, etc.  They ask you a bunch of questions but I can't say that I have ever received a product that wasn't perfect for me.  You just go to the website and customize whatever product you would like and then give over your credit card and it's arriving at your house within a week.  Granted it's not instant gratification but if you are as busy as I am this is definitely the way to go.  And to be honest with you the prices are not any worse then hitting the makeup counter at the local mall even with the shipping (which there is none if you order enough.)  So check it out, see what you think and once you start you'll also began receiving emails about all the great deals they offer or free gifts they're giving away with certain purchases.  Just check it out and see what you think!
