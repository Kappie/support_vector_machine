You brightened up the darkest day and the cloudiest sky.                                                           Many tears I have seen and cried, They have all poured out like rain. I know that you're happy now And no longer in any pain.                                                  Something so hard ges stright to the soul, It seems impossible to get over and my heart is left with a big hole.                                                                             I'm trying to be happy, wearing a smile; but I'm dying inside. The world seems to be fading and I just want to run and hide. Everywhere I go I see your face, and realize how much I miss you; and on the day you died, a piece of me died too.
