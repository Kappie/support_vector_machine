I found myself wondering why the second that I made friends The year was over and had come to its end Graduation practice was over It was almost time to say goodbye A tear dripped down my cheek And I began to cry This year was gone I had made some friends I knew I couldnt say goodbye So it was graduation, that I didnt attend.
