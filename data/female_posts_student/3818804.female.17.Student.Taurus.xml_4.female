Have you ever eaten something and then when you were done you ask yourself "What the hell is this shite I just ate?" Because I ask myself that sometimes. lolz. When I was opening a soysauce packet itpopped in my face...   I worked hard today in the hot hot sun...I also turned black as black can be, I am now officially darker than Jenn.    I was going to go to Knott's Berry Farm on Wednesday, but it's way too hot for that shite. I want to go to Raging Waters...I haven't been there in like ten years...BUT I really really really want to go to Six Flags!!    Not much to say...so, until next time love    P.S. Take me out biatches
