It was really hard to think with everyone yelling all there is to remember on the court at once and trying to pick out which one is meant for you, and then there was Eric, who was getting really upset, and all these other things to think about (like how odd/nasty you really look with too-too-tight spandex shorts on). We also bought another car...   urlLink  http://www.toyota.com/html/shop/vehicles/camry/    It's that one right on that first page. It's the same color and everything. I picked the color, against my mother's choice of this green-black metallic that reminded me of like, duck poop or something. Now we have three Camrys. How silly. Anyway, Star Testing began today, and that was pretty easy, if you don't count repressing the urge to run away while Anna complains twelve times about how she thought that "couplets" in poetry meant groups of four.. Anyway, I-search is coming along, and things are nearing.. my cheh's graduation in North Carolina, where I get to rub Choo's not-so-shaved-anymore head, Disneyland(!!!), graduation and such, and then a nice, long summer. Yippee... Oh, and by the way, check out   urlLink  http://www.zefrank.com/    Look at his instructional/educational videos.. especially "The Predate Confidence Builder" and "How to Act Convincingly". It's funny.
