No one to talk to is going to hurt for awhile..It's not like it hasn't happened before. I was happy, but I don't know where that went. I will still love him no matter what. I left him before..and I don't want to ever again and I guess he doesn't see that. He said he was scared I would leave him again, but now im the one that is scared. He may have a lot of faults, but deep down..he is my Babe and no one else can ever see how much he means to me..How happy and excited he makes me feel. No one can ever give me those feelings like he can. I miss his arms around me and telling me that things will be ok...Because we are fighting and I hurt inside because im seeing our relationship tear and snap apart. Im holding my hands up high to hold everything together, but I need help..His help. If you do read this Terik...I love you. I have always loved you even though I did leave you. Im cold right now and I wish you were with me..Holding me tightly, saying that you love me more than anything. My tears and my screaming right now will never help anything. Crying helps nothing in this world. I am pathetic and I know I may be childish at times, but so are you too. I take the yelling and stuff that you do. Even though some things are not my fault and you yell or something, I take it and I still love you. Writing this may not help either, but when you don't have anyone to talk to..I can at least type it. Sometimes I wish I could take the pain away, take the hurt and tears..But I am not that strong..I am not the person I once was. My wings are damaged and I can't fly anymore..I think if I did want to fly, you would give me your wings. Wouldn't you? Im trying to think of times I had with you, but im so worried that you are going to leave me forever..I don't want that. I wish that I never have left you and caused us to be this way. I am the one to take the blame for that. If you do leave me, I will be a mess. I'll shatter and fall to pieces..I wish I could talk to you right now..To hear you say that you love me..I always get chills when you say that to me. You protected me and made sure I was safe, but I messed that up. I messed everything up. Love is so weird..It's so great one moment but painful the next. I would give anything up to have him right now..If he knew how much he means to me..Oh! If he only knew! 311 isn't helping as much as I thought it would..My music is always sad..Oh well..I love you Babe..Forever I will...
