Anyhow, 6 Flags was pretty fun, I guess, but it's amazing how, as you get older, rides get more and more unexciting. I rode the Superman for the first time ever, though, and that was quite a wow. Although I'm a regular screamer by reflex, I'm normally pretty relaxed, but, from what I recall, I think I said, "I want my mommy" more times in a row than ever in my life as we were getting near the first freefall (and I was never really prone to saying the phrase growing up). The ride was, indeed, very awesome. I rode in the front, and it really did feel as though one were flying.   Otherwise, I'm slightly sunburnt and have developed flip flop tan lines *shakes head*.    I also learned that the only thing that doesn't get old is, indeed, coffee. Tee hee.
