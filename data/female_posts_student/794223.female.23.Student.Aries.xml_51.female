Her tumor is just too big.  While it is not the answer we would have liked to have heard, we feel God led us in this direction as the only recourse to rid Brandi once and for all of the cancer that is raging in her head.  She is scheduled to meet with Dr. Raymond Sawaya, Chairman of the Neurosurgery Dept at M. D. Anderson on Thursday.  Again my Brandi has gotten the best of the best to be her surgeon.  Surgery should be scheduled for next week.  Dr. Yung has the utmost confidence that they can remove some of the tumor without damaging her speech or motor skills.  We have to put our faith in God and the skills he has given the doctors that she will come out of this surgery as well as she came out of the last surgery.  One positive note is that the pathologists at M. D. Anderson are still questioning whether her tumor is a Glioblastoma or whether it might be a lower grade.  That could be a good thing because given the prognosis….a lower grade of cancer would have better results.   My Brandi’s spirits are still great.  She is ready to fight this monster and WIN.  Keep her in your prayers.  ~~~~~~ So overall, we're pretty hopeful.  I believe that this is good news; while undergoing another surgery will of course be stressful, Brandi's prognosis might be a lot better if they can at least remove some of the tumor.  Perhaps things will look up from here.  On a happier note (though certainly a bizaare one)...I'm sure that everybody and their dog has heard Dean's caucus speech by now.  What in the world was the man thinking?!  He seriously needs to calm down a bit.  Take it down a notch, man.  Take it down a notch.  I was very sad to see Gephardt go. :-( He was, without a doubt, one of the kindest and most genuine men that the U.S. legislature has ever been blessed to have.  Not a spot on his record, and he truly gave a damn.  Here is a piece of the final address he gave to his supporters:  "I'm going to return to Congress, and dedicate my last remaining year to representing them with the best of my ability.  Every day of my working life I've sought to bring positive change to the hard working men and women of this country, and my efforts will not cease in these final months.  "I will continue to work for universal healthcare, pension reform, more teachers in the classroom, energy independence from Persian Gulf oil, and a trade policy that doesn't sacrifice American jobs in pursuit of trade with countries that have no respect for the environment, or the living conditions of their own people.  American workers can't compete with that, and they shouldn't have to.  "I'm proud of the campaign we waged.  It was fought on the principles of fairness for our workers, security for our seniors, and opportunity for our children.  My career in public office is coming to an end, but the fight is never over.  "All of you who have dedicated so many months and years to this effort, I hope and pray that you will stay in the arena of public life.  Never stop fighting for what you believe in and never stop believing that we can make a difference.  The towering strength of America is its endless reservoir of citizens who never tire of the sacrifice to make it better.  "I love this country and I love my family.  The silver lining in all of this, is that I'll finally get to see them, at every opportunity, rather than when opportunities could be found.  Jane, Matt, Chrissy and Kate are my life.  And to them I'll always be grateful.  God bless you all."  I just recently found out that when his son was 2 years old, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Due to an experimental treatment, however, his son is alive and well today.  I think I'll write him a letter inquiring about the treatment.  Dammit, he would have made a good President.  Oh well.  As long as Bush gets beat, I'll be alright with whomever wins the nomination.
