I was super happy, though, because I got two A's on my Illumination Night reflections, even though I thought one of them was just o.k.  She must have been in a really good mood.  I hadn't gotten and A in that class on anything since like September on my Ruby story that everyone so nicely likes to make fun of.  So that was e-x-c-I-t-I-n-g (you would laugh at me if you knew how long it took me to write that exciting right there).    So, then I had Bio and that was dumb but we did nothing and went off on all sorts of "crazy" tangents about cancer and such.  Then in  History I wicked love my group for our Peace conference -me, Kim (who always seems to be in my group), and Ben.  We got the U.S. and it is so incredibly easy, we just laughed at the other groups, mostly France, actually.  Oh god, tomorrow is Valerie and Steph's (oh no! I spelled your name wrong.  Poor Stef Miss "Actually, It's the original Latin form".  Well, yes, so their SCI is tomorrow and I am so so not happy about having to sit through and entire class of the most annoying talking people in our whole class.  Fun Stuff.    Hmm... ah yes.  Then I had French and we had to do Suivez la Piste, and it went  absolutely awfully, even though we listened to it three times.   (Carolyn you can skip the next part) Haha so here comes the only funny part of the day.  At lunch, Miss Carolina and I were discussing art class/clay because I had art long block and got mine back.  So apparently, in eighth grade, she made a containerish thing with a butterfly on it.  It was all butterfly-y shaped and even had a smiley face.  So she decided to add a handle to it.  A big, long handle that stuck out right in the middle of the butterfly.  Yeah, right there.  And it was painted orange.  Naughty miss Carolyn, apparently all the boys made fun of it and were like "What is this?" and started laughing and such.  And to make it worse, it is still on her kitchen table.    Yes so then art and math were normal.  In art, I finished glazing my snowman but math was so so so so long, even though I'd already been warned about how boring it was.  But, I did get a 100 on math test that a lot of people didn't do to well on, so that was cool with me.  Then I walked up the hill, came home blah blah blah boringness.     That was so boring, why did I even make myself relive it?
