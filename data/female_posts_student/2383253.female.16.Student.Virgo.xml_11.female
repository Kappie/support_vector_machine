And Chris is a wuss because he got scared when he learned that I talk to myself while driving. Constantly. But yeah, I had an epiphany on the way there and realized that I knew exactly where it is. My dad and brother and I go to this Indian place off Clairemont Mesa Blvd. all the time, and where we went was about a minute from there.  It's free scoop night at Baskin Robbins. 6-10 pm. And I'm kinda stuck here right now. Maybe go later.  Bye all. P.S. I'm sick of APs and everything to do with them, tests included.
