Going to India for 1 month and we're leaving this Saturday. My house is crazy.  It looks like someone broke in and just ripped our whole house apart. So upon my mother's craziness..i've been packing and cleaning my head off. And as much as i love cleaning (ha) i would so much rather be outside in the nice weather and just kick it back..maybe with some chalk...but NO i must clean!  Last night was fun. I hung out with Cherry, Jennifer, and Jessica. We went bowling. Had good clean fun. We came home at like 3am and my 'rents didn't care..so i really do feel like they're starting to trust me again, which is VERY nice. It was nice hanging out with all of them. They came back and we scratched backs, even tho Jess sucks at it haha. it's okay jess. haha i'm wearin her bearden shirt to school tomorrow and she's wearin my farragut shirt..we're gonna see our fellow peer's reactions, it should be great. well i'm gonna go. i have a hot date..with the vaccumm.   OMG--i almost forgot...last night when we were passing by the Rush..i decided i would be stupid and call up Jason, cuz i wanted to see him..just cuz i was curious. So i went by and said hey. Nothing more just a hug and some small talk. I have no Freaking clue why i did that.  I felt like such an idiot. It may have been cuz i was all like dressed up and i just wanted him to see what he was missing out on. HA. okay i'm OFFF  Me + Vaccum = HOT DATE!  VROOOOOM VROOOOOOOm. god i'm a nerd
