It was so tough at school on Tuesday to see everyone so upset, especially my speech teacher. She was right behind the car when it happened, and she was just so upset. I've been praying for his family though. The good news though...is that Richa is home now! They released her from the hospital, and from what I hear, it'll be a long road to recovery, but I know if anyone, she will be able to.do it.  Yesterday we had our second jazz competition. Thank God we weren't competing. We were sooo bad. Like, I was so ashamed, I didn't even want to talk to anyone after. I felt so rotton, and I wanted to cry, but...it's ok. These things happen. JSO did really well. I'm proud of them. They got first in their division, and they SHOULD HAVE gotten grand champions. They were awesomely awesome!  The day other than playing went well though. In an effort to be more like Diane...hehe, I love her method of doing this. It's so great.  Kelly definitely possitively won. She put up with me all day yesterday, and she understood when I was snippity after Jazz band played, Emily won just because she's Emily, Eric lost...eek, it drove me insane, couldn't get rid of him, Im sorry, but it drove me mad!!! Dave won, Peter actually won, he was a polite boy yesterday, Justin definitely won. He was really nice about us messing it up big time. Dan...probably lost if I would have talked to him. He always loses. Carson won, I'm sure Joanne, Kathryn, Kelly, and Nikki all would have won if I saw them. That stupid mean judge lost BIG TIME! HE WAS SO MEAN!!! RAR! Oh yeah...Chris and Jim won since they both went into a girls locker room. Haha. We found the weight room!!!!! Bryan won, he was nice...except for the whole shpeal at the end of the day, Mike Klos lost, and Diane definitely won because she's Diane, and diane doesn't lose. Also...I don't steal ideas like this from people who lose.   Yeah, so...more about the girls bathroom, because it was just hilarious. Kelly and I...and...Eric *shudder* were all walking around with Chris and Jim. Well, they decided to go into the girls locker room and take a...yeah...and so they did. So, we're all running around in there, and we decide to leave, and they say, "Kelly and Catie walk out first and make sure there's no one there." Well, of course they didn't expect there to be, so they start coming out as soon as Kelly and I got out. Well...we didn't get a chance to let them know that THERE WAS SOMEONE! This chick was walking down the stairs headed for the locker room. Kelly and I tried to hold the door shut, but we couldn't say anything since we were laughing too hard. So they walk out, and this girl sees them, and just gives the WEIRDEST look! It was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time! It completely made my day! Also, in their weight room, they have this like..conveyer belt type thing with rocks on it so you can rock climb. It's the coolest. They have a cooler school.   We got yelled at too, by this guy. Kelly and I were humming the Mission Impossible theme, and it gave us away, and this guy comes out, and he was really polite about it actually...he just said we need to leave, and couldn't be in that part of the building anymore. We saw him again later while playing football in the hall. He gave us weird lookis. Whoops...Oh well, not like I've never seen a weird look before.   I sat next to Bryan, and Scott, and Musto on the way home since Kelly listened to music and slept. It was cool...for the most part...we wont talk about the uncool part with the, "what's your prefference of color?" But yeah, all in all, it was a pretty fun day. I got to spend tons of time with Kelly which is awesome, and JSO did so well. YAY!  Today...I've done nothing but read, and that's what I shall continue to do. Until next time...don't eat yellow snow.  *Muah* :)
