But the sad thing is most of the photos are of my team mates.I had battery problems on the days where we hung out with the improv people so I couldn't take photos of all them :( Sad times.  Here is Bekah in the car on the way to disney land! She looks quite happy for being one who woke up at 3 AM. :)   Our first steps in the "Happiest Place on Earth"   Getting scared before Indiana Jones! (that ride ROCKED!!!)   I conquered my first roller coaster! I rock!!! :)  The characters on their float!   The  notorious teapots!   Trying to get the sword out of the stone. [I think stephen gave up!!]   Before the "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" movie   Heather and I infront of cinderellas castle!!   Me getting ready for BINGO night [and my first meeting of andrew even though I was unaware of it at the time]    What we saw while on stage at the Improvathon [though all the seats were filled!]   Our team!!!!     Andrew... *sigh* This is the only picture I have of him and it's not very good but you get the idea :)   Central. Ah! They were quite intimidating. But the guy on the left was..well..beautiful. He wasn't hot but everything abot him was perfect. It was weird.      That's alllll!!!! I wuv you guuys!
