I know it takes a lot of nerve to go to the hospital and have your arm stitched and admit you did it yourself, and it doesn't exactly help when you're looked down on as being an attention seeking idiot. I know, I've been there, but... I don't know. It makes me feel somewhat disabled, I'd rather, for some strange reason, that folks were up front with me rather than hiding behind a law that says they have to behave in a certain manner. I like honest reactions. Infact, I'd say the fact that the nurse scoffed at me in the hospital helped me in a way, it made more determined to stop. I didn't want to be looked down upon for the rest of my life. Inforcing laws just makes it seem like we're accepting it like any other disability, like something that can't be helped/cured, when it can. We shouldn't be accepting things, we should be changing them. Not that I have any better suggestions though so... Hrm.       Bah... I'm not making any sense, huh.      I suppose I just look upon myself as being as pathetic as most others do, so I kinda figure I deserve whatever harsh treatment I get. **shrugs**
