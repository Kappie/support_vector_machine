I smile and glance into the rear view mirror at my life, packed into about five suitcases.  The brown, slightly worn bags were the only remnants of my past as I drove toward the now dusky horizon.  Opening my driver's side window, it smells like rain.  Everyone around here knows the familiar scent...slightly damp, a little musty, and a feeling that the air buzzes with a new energy.  Maybe it is because I have lived here for so long.  After a while, one becomes accustomed to these types of feelings.    Anyhow, here I am, driving away from that life.  I miss it now, as I reminisce.  Yet, looking back to the road, I feel confident in my new life, my new way, my new...everything.  The sun has set now, as I drive toward darkness.  Suddenly, I notice a car has pulled up in the passing lane beside me and is driving at the same speed so as not to pass but not to fall behind either.  Nervous.  I speed up; the car imitates.  Nervous.  I slow down; the car imitates.  Nervous.  I decide to look over.  Relief.  A familiar face inundates me with memories of my old world.  Mom.  In my rush to leave I had left my old quilt, the one I'd had since forever, at home.  College life would have been impossible without my comfort.  We stopped there on the side of the highway.  I ran to her and gave an embrace with all the power my arms could muster.  I am still your little girl.  I can't do this without you.  She wrapped my old quilt around me, squeezed me tight, and gave my forehead a kiss.  I won't forget it.  I stepped back into my car and drove away.  The rain began.
