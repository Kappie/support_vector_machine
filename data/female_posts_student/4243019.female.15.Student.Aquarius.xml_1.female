Unless you ahve narcolepsy. Which I don't. Anyway...  Today I was discussing with my mom the impending potential move. If things go they way that my parents want, we'll be moving a good 16 hours away from my present location on the East Coast.  (Hah! I'M NOT TELLING YOU FREAKY STALKERS WHERE!)   Err... Yeah. And if things go well(by the parental standard) this move will take play before December.   On the up side, chances are I'd have a room in the refinished garage, right next to the game room which will hopefully hold a pool table. I'd have my own semi-private batroom(it would really be the 'garage' batroom, but...), a private dark room, a large study area, and a tinyHigh School. The current enrollment of this High School is jsut under 300. Yeah...  On the down side, however, we would be withing a ten minute bike-ride of my mom's extremely straight-laced family. I don't know if i can take more than about 2 weeks a year of "Elbows off the table!" "Don't smudge the windows!" "Don't trail your hands over the wall!" etc. Also, the family up there is VERY religion-oriented. While I'm still a Christian, I'm probably not as faithful as they would like me to be. My aunt had a problem with Pokemon becuase of violence, what would she think of a YuGiOh, LOTR, and Harry Potter obsesse who listens to a varitey of music including everything from the more acceptable classical and world to the 'less acceptable' rock and punk? Yeah. I didn't think it'd go over that well either.  On a totally related note, I'd be going to a relatively small school. Im my experiance and from tales told of other horrors, that means that most likely everyone is going to be the exact opposite of me. This may be steriotyping, but we go up there and I'm expecting a large group of preppy girls and poser guys, all whom will try and make friends with me. I'm not a social person. I have made a grand total of three friends without someone I know and trust introdusing me to them first. And the most recent was in 5th grade, and I'm going into 10th. So... WHat does that tell you?  Also, referring back to the relative standpoint, the closest in age to me just turned 14 in... June I think. However, we have very little in common. I mean, we used to be best friends, but Kat is kind of a tomboy while I'm (quite frankly) a but stuck up. She's really open and friendly and I can tell she makes friends easily. I'm not that way. I just can't picture her listening to some of the stuff I do, watching the stuff I watch, reading the stuff I read, etc. Next youngerst after her is my 13 year old brother, after that my 10 year old borther, the slightly younger 10-year old cousin, the 9-year old cousin, the 6 year old, the 5 year old, and then the 1-year old cousin. Going up the next oldest is 25-27.. I can't remember. After that its (about) 29. Then late 30's. and so on. And mentally I jsut don't connect with any of them. Like I said, I'm a lot more loose than my striaght laced relatives. No matter how many flatulant-related jokes they may make. ... Er, actually thats my dad's side. Okay... No matter how many lemonade-related jokes they may make.  That one is another story for another time, whem I'm not feeling so blegh.  But anyway... You can see why I'm as opposed to this as I am for it? I mean, we go up there I'll get my drivers licence almsot right away. I could go aorund the (incredibly tiny) town... I could crive up to the next biggest town about a half hour away... or go an hour away to the next nearest mall... But anyway... I'd be a lot distanced from my family, moreso than I would if we were to stay here. Especially if my room is more removed like I'm hoping it will be. I'd focus on my studies, my art(which I could possibly sell at the frequent, often large art fairs the town holds), and my pool game.  I realized that I've barely mentioned the firends I'd leave behind... Well, this network of friends I have is like my life support system. I can't tell you how many times its saved me, from depression and other things. Seeing as I'm in a fiarly good mood and I don't want to ruin it by reminicing, I'll leave those instances for another time, but the point is moving would be the proverbial removing of the scaffolding, and it will be up to time to see if I collapse or not...  Another thing is that I would have to find another psyciatrist and another psycologist. Well, possibly not another psycologist, but psyciatrist definately if I'm going to keep my prescription meds. I'm not going to go into that right now, though, either.  I will have internet, hopefully a broadband connection, and thus will be able to keep in contact with the majoraty of my friends, but what of those who don't have I-net, or never get on, or whatever? High chance I'll lose contact with them, becuase I'm not good at the whole 'don't forget to write' gig. I don't do well with the phone, either. I need IM for long distance communication...  Anyway, I've ranted enough and left enough for you to look at, say "Hell with this, I'm not reading that!", and ignore.  Peace, love, and S'mores!
