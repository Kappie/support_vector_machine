And now Matt is at the cottage so I can't talk to him (sniff, sniff!), and I won't have any emails from him, either.  Phooey!  Herve leaves on Wednesday night, which is sad because he livens up the lab.  I'll have no one to sign along to bad Israeli radio with anymore.  Oh well.  Okay, ought to get back to work...
