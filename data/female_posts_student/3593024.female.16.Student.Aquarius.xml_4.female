I went to out to eat Thursday and i have great guy friends who I didn't know that were such good friends until I needed them and not to mention my absolute best friend ever Sarah she has always been there for me and I am so thankful.  Friday I went to the movies and saw Dodgeball it was an awesome and hilarous movie.  Saturday night i went with Sarah and Steven we were suppose to go to the movies but we just didnt feel like spending $8 again so we saved our money and went to to Walmart it was a blast.  I pushed Steven in the basket and i let go and he went straight into a pole Sarah and I laughed so hard it was unreal.  He is a blast to hang out with.  Well tonight Sarah and I are going to the guys basketball game.  That is all for now and    dont ever give up your real friends for anyone.   Jess
