Kat was kind enough to set up this blog for us, and I would like to thank and commend her for that.  Now, she has made mention of a basics of character creation post on this blog. I am not going to undertake that project, and I am going to ask that no one else yet attempt it either. Although to we who are experienced it may seem a simple - even effortless - process to crank out level one characters like cheap lead soldiers (as indeed level one characters are), I must point out that to most people who have never held a PHB (that's Player's HandBook for our truely new initiates), it can be overwhelming, especially if you get some wannabe instructor's halfassed Reader's Digest version.  That said, I will go through character creation with anyone and everyone who needs it upon such time as we know who is going to be in our group. Currently, I have the list as myself, Kat (Kathleen from NJ, who I will call Kat to differentiate her from her friend Kathie who lives... somewhere else - please forgive me for forgetting), Kathie (the aforementioned friend of my friend who I hope will soon be my friend), and Francis (another friend of Kat's who I hope will soon by my friend).  And so it does come to pass that we have... three PCs and a DM. Blah. Harumph. In a word, crap. We need more people. That's your first bit of homework, go get more players. I want at least six PC (that is, Player Characters) in this game before I start it. I'm trying to find people among my friends, but most of my friends aren't newbies and refuse to come to my call (and harumph on them, cuz I know you're all gonna kick ass and chew bubblegum by the time I'm done with yas!).  Anyway, that's it for my bit of inspiring leadership. I'll be your host and DM and hopefully provide you with a painless introduction to the beautiful world of High Fantasy role-playing that is D
