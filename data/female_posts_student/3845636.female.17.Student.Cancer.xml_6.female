Thinking too much again... all the feelings bottled up in me. can't find a way to pour all of them out. Even if I had the opportunity... I'm not sure who's the right person either. Anyway... I'll try to keep myself occupied with all the important stuff and I wish I can just chuck all these matters aside. I have got my focus right and I'll bang hard on my piriorities too...  Watched the taiwanese idol show 'qian jin bai fen bai' today... Guess I agree with what one of the characters said." Meeting the right person at the wrong time "... may not work either. Anyway... quite true~ Hmn.. personally I believe alot in fate. So what's meant to be may be there for you to discover. However, if one chooses not to treasure it, then this chance may just slip away... even without one noticing it.  yup yup yup... soooo lots of mix feelings today... haha... all these friendships and interpersonal relationship thingy... can be quite bothering to one's life at times. How do you differentiate between these two issues? hmn~ I think there's no definite answer to this. However, I'll not let it affect me... I must be strong yah. i'll try!  hope that I'll have my voice fully recovered tomorrow... and to sort out my thoughts properly soon... lala... that's all for today... *_*
