Arghhh, I think I need shooting more than Katie. I might end up inundating you with texts, Katie, sorry I'll be very very bored. Bleugh, a whole week of making endless cups of tea. Hehehehe, you'll be having fun in Spain I guess, trying to ask some Spanish amigo where the nearest loo is ("Que?").  Well whatever happens, it can't be as bad as the last time we went to France. We all got headlice and had to go into a French pharmacy and ask for head-lice conditioner - "Erm...tu as le..le shampoo pour les petit, erm...petit things dans ma chevuax...dans la tete...erm...???" And then the French guy slammed this bottle on the counter (apparently) as if to say - "Get out of my country, you filthy English."!  Anyway, erm well see you in about three weeks, because I don't think any of our holidays co-incide, (what are we going to do about Laura's birthday???) and erm, have fun! I'm just about to get in the car and fly...fly to...Eastbourne. Great.
