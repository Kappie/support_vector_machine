SCARY!!)((just found out Kuja was a man... sort of thought he was a girl...)) 3. Irvine (Do I have a thing for guys with guns? ew.. that came out wrong...) 4. Zidane (ugh...isn't he a pervert? I HATE PERVERTS) 5. Sephiroth ( Dude looks like a lady...sorry, but I can't stand it when guys are prettier than I am.)  So I pretty much hate these results. Except the first one. Mmmmmm..... Vincentilicious...
