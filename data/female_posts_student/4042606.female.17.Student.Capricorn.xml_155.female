That's right, I have discovered that Ian actually enjoys playing Kingdom Hearts more than talking to me, or anyone else in the world. I hope his house doesn't catch on fire because he would surely die. Blissfully but dead none the less. Anyway, I am finishing the picture drawing fiasco that I got myself into. Ian was going to help, but I don't think that is going to happen now that he is playing with Goofy and Donald.
