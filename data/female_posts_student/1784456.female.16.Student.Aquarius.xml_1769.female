Oh wait, they are, but in companies. Damn, have to get me one of those. Well, if any stalkers out there want a place to call home on the net feel free to have a bit of the corner of my blog *no teeth marks please* and keep the graffiti to a minimal: you're blogs shit and you can't spell! If everyone respects these rules we'll get on fine... (just stay away from the fridge)
