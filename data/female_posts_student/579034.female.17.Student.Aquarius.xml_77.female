I miss them like so much I never get to really spend any time with them. It was cool, I spent most of my time with cousin Mikey whos my age so I guess I should stop callin him Mikey. But, we had a good time, there were like 10 pillow fites. Not the ::poof:: ow ::poof:: ow... these were like ::BAM:: OW! ::BAM:: OW MY EYE! ::BAM:: THATS IT YOUR DEAD! Then we all snuck away and went for a walk on one of the trails through the woods by my house. Mike and Dommie (another one I can't call by their kiddy name any more)... Mike and Dom were like tee-p-ing (sp?) trees as we walked along... singin a song... heh just playin.  So when we got back we thought we were gonna get in trouble cause Debbie and Judy were standin outside all "Where were you?" and we said we went for a walk around the block.  Then it was back inside to my room where 10 boys ranging from 5-16 had a few (5) dogpiles on cousin Lauren. Hurt like hell, and all the boys got hit down below AT LEAST once. It's so funny the faces they make lol.  So yea, then, school is goin on, that could be be a bit better but.... Mick is commin in 24 days which is awesome.  Okay, thats about it. Much Love x0x0x0x0x
