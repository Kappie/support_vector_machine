There are a lot of new neato features, but I'm not feeling the aesthetic side of it...  They added more templates to chose from--several of which I like-- but I don't think I'm ready to give up my simple black and white one...  They added a built-in commenting system. I turned that one on and left the exsisting one in, so I could see how they compare...   ....Ok, back to what I really wanted to type... I'm hating summer already, and it hasn't ever arrived yet...  It was in the high 80s today... Yeah, I know it's not that bad, but I'm a wimp.. Actually, I probably would have loved it if the friggen school had air-conditioning! Bah... Running and getting all sweating is no fun, but sitting in class for eight hours and sweating and not being able to do anything about it royally sucks! ...Russel (my English teacher) brought in a fan to have in his room.. That helped somewhat...  The county's (4-H) Council Circle is tonight. That should be fun :)   Oh, oh! And no school tomorrow! Thank Jeebus for (primary) Election Day! :D
