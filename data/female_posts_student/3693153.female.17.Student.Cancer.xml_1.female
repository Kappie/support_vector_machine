It was a pretty gross experience, I never want to ride one again! There was this man behind me, and he kept on talking to me and looking at me through the rearview mirror. I pretended not to hear him and I shut my eyes, I panicked when he said "Miss bigay mo na sakin number mo" I told the driver to stop and I jumped out in front of Shangri-La. My friends didn't want to go in there though, I don't know why. Shangri-La has the best shops and restaurants around! Well, after that terrifying experience, we had to walk to go to Megamall, my feet hurt though it wasn't that far. God, I miss having a car and driver.
