They have a vibe similar to the back and forth dialog between Lisa Schwartzbaum and Owen Gliberman in Entertainment Weekly, though I'd have to say I'm more like Owen, i.e the harsher critic.  I will now stop digressing and get to the topic at hand which is  Talking Lives .  Let me begin by concurring with you, the film was without one redeeming virtue.  But I hated the film for a different reason you either didn't see or don't agree with, that the movie was misogynist.  Here are some reasons why:  1.)  In the scene where Angelina Jolie is chasing after the bad guy from the art gallery through the Carnival she's wearing pearls.  Pearls!?  Pearls are for First Lady's, not FBI agents.  2.)  When the brilliant FBI profiler learns the identity of the serial killer in the hospital how does she react- she faints and is barely able to utter to Olivier Martinez who to go after.  3.)  The twist.  Woman in jeopardy movies are as old as Hollywood but this movie took it a step farther by setting up the third act as the pregnant woman in jeopardy.  The idea that an FBI agent would keep the baby of a serial killer is ludicrous but the producers don't stop there.  After five minutes of whimpering around, Jolie's agent Scott is stabbed in the stomach.  There are few images regarding women more iconic than a pregnant stomach, and watching the scissors plunge into that belly made me more uncomfortable than all of  Kill Bill Vol. 1  put together.  If that's not enough she then removes padding as to say "AHA! We used the pregnancy as a ploy to fool you."  Now I don't want to sound as if I think pregnant women are sacred and can't be used in Hollywood (I would never give up my Kill Bill), but I had no attachment to Jolie's character so the ploy at the end had no impact, it just felt cheap.  I'm glad you referenced  Seven  a far superior film.  Unlike  Taking Lives ,  Seven  had believable characters you cared about and most importantly had something to say.   Seven , embodied in Morgan Freeman's character, was making a point that apathy is one of our greatest sins.   Taking Lives  says what, be careful of loving one twin more than the other, especially if the favorite accidentally dies in childhood?  (One last note I hope the producers of  Seven  sue over the blatantly copied opening credit sequence)  Sorry my post ran long.  I don't need a detailed response but in your next post let me know if you think I'm totally off base in regards to  Taking Lives  being anti-women.  P.S.- I didn't find  Kill Bill Vol. 1  uncomfortable in the least, I was just trying to reference a film that some professed to have issues with.
