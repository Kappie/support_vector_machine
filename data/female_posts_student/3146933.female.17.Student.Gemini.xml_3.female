"And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby" I have *2* days left of school. Memory day's comin up. Gah I'm so scared...I'm debating on whether or not I'm even going to go to it. I almost cry thinking about it. Ok and if I haven't run into Matt...like 500 times a freakin day...here lately anyways. It makes me SO mad. I see him...every freakin where I turn. But I'm scared about givin him his graduation gift. Man, I don't know what to think...I swear. I have *someone* tellin me one thing and other people telling me different. I have mixed feelings right now. You know though..I want Matt to talk to me memory day...because...he spent 1/2 of his time in high school with me. I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't...I won't be able to take it. I'll try though..talkin to him. I guess I dont want to get back with him...since he'll be goin to Alabama and I'd never see him anyways, but I really wouldn't mind being friends with him. I'll always have feelings for him though. any guy i've talked with/dated/gone out with since me and him broke up..they haven't made me as happy as what matt did. Oh well I don't feel like talking about him. Memory day. Yes...OK when my class, the juniors get up to take our place in the senior section..dear God, I'm going to bawl. I remember wishing every day away and wishing I was out of school and that I was a senior...well...it went by too fast. It's here now. My last year getting things "handed" to me. It's a scary thought.. Happy 18th Birthday Monica!
