And its not even cold in here. crazy... and do you ever feel your heart beat in your throat?  I am going crazy here. Why!?WHY did i have to come here?! I wish i was back in Katy! (i never thought i'd ever say those words in my life...)Well all i can do is sit here, and wait. and think. Which are my two worst enemies. But i've been getting emails! so i have something to look forward to.    I would say something- but i know alanah would march right up here an smack me. I smell Saurkrought(i have no idea in gods name how to spell that) and hot dogs cooking- permeating throughout the entire house! i could gag. And when the miracle food of old people is fried chicken and chinese food- it doesn't seem so crazy to be living off of rye bread and strawberry cream cheese for a week. hopefully there will be real food at the july 4th dinner.  We went to the Arts Fest today. Amazing things there! i wanted to get soemthing everywhere i turned. I guess i'll just have to wait til i'm rich to buy all these things to decorate my house with. A GLASS mural of a Jackson Pollack look-alike. I loved it!! $4,200!... But! on the sunny side i did buy a Dave Matthews print! A guy did drawings of all these famous ppl: Beatles- Hendrix-Cobain-Bob Marley hehe- and he said i could have Dave for $15 since i kept coming back and looking at it. I need to learn to hide my yearnful glances. SO! i was happy :) I saw my cousin today... she came home for a few minutes with her boyfriend for free food and another change of clothes. Its kinda strange here- Her best friends name is Jenna- and her boyfriends name is Gordon.  So i'm constantly turning my head when i hear snatches of conversations.      Oh Ya! My dad came up! I've missed him SO MUCH! and now we actually get to go hiking and go places!      Dito on reading Grapes of Wrath- tho maybe its not so bad. I have a huge list of books i want to read- but know i wont get to.     I'm running out of cds! i go to bed late, but everyone else wakes up at fucking 7:30!! So i have to turn on my cd's and shut the door for my next 5 hours of sleep. I've gone to bed and waken up to coldplay, dave,pink floyd, and anastasia soundtrack all this week. And have ya'll heard the Mulan Soundtrack? Thats my favorite by far.    'Lets get down to business to defeat the huns! HU!'     'You're unsuited for the rage of war, so pack up- go home-     your through. How can i make a man out of you'     Go watch it. its really addicting, i'm not just crazy. See you guys! I'm driven to desperate measures here! Alanah- tell me everything thats happeed in Sex and the city. I need some superficial antics in my life again!  and yes alyssa. I know when your birthday is. February 5th....time is relative. right?...i know- you can hate me...but you still have to tell me some stuff you want. they have alot up here! you know those hottie earrings we bought? a store around the corner has them. TELL ME!     Anyone else want anything? Massachusettes Dirt? I'll try to see if i can post pictures up- but not even I may be that techno-literate, Lys. sigh... so i guess i have to be shoved back into reality now, eh? what a cruel, cruel world. please you guys, send me lots of messages- or posts- or emails. Thats what i look forward to all day! Dont leave me alone with myself! because i  actually  start to believe these crazy dreams i have...and then i wake up, and who knows... alanah...im driving myself mad-insane. And i Miss you SO Much! i never get signal out here!! Its like a fucking IDAHO!  breath...8 more days.  "I know i'm Mad I've always been Mad  Like everyone is Mad."  note the time \/  im not tired... its going to be a long night.
