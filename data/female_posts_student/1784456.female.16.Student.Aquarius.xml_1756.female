Damn them! It's sooo annoying! What else can I have as a gift for passing my GCSE's? (It's impossible for me to fail) I've been chained to the pc now until the page loads *damn page work!* Apart from that... freedom from school! For a whole two weeks before the exams! Yeay! I'm having a seven dwarfs gathering on Tuesday, everyone has to dress like one of the seven dwarfs and sing along to Disney videos! What a great break from revising!
