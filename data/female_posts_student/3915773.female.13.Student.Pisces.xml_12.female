At stake is more than the fate of possible child pornographers. The United States military has become increasingly reliant to digital images from drones and satellites to give soldiers a sense of the battlefield. Law enforcement officers routinely use digital cameras to photograph crime scenes. Newspapers and magazines are now dependent on digital photographs that can easily doctored.     Professor Farid, an associate professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, has developed algorithms that can detect whether a photograph has been altered. For example, when two images are spliced together, one of the photographs must be altered to fit the other with image-editing software like Adobe Photoshop. This technique, no matter how cunningly put together, can be detected by the differences between the pixels within the photo. However, this test is only foolproof with uncompressed TIFF image files, which produce high quality pictures. Compressed picture formatting, which is used mostly online, makes identifying frauds more difficult.   An even more innovative technique in progress is the production of a camera that is able to take a picture of the photographer’s iris as well as one through the lens at the same moment. A person’s iris is comparable to a fingerprint. The idea is to compress all the information to be encrypted within the photograph. If any encoded data were missing, the picture would immediately be branded as a fake. Even though this method seems very high-tech, I still think it would be a long time before doctored photos are thoroughly eliminated. Technology advances every day, benefiting researchers as well as the ones doing the tampering.
