I made a new record for the longest I have slept in this summer.  Then I took a nice long shower and blow dryed my hair. For some reason my hair has been really shiny lately, me likes.  Then we went to goodwill and I got a costume for theatre camp. Haha.  it is the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life, its GREAT!  I am gonna take a picture of it soon :)  Then I went to Fred Meyer and got some food to eat on the plane. Woohoo!  I got gardettos and circus animals! YAY!   Dude.  You knwo those plastic hair clips with the plastic bows that you used to wear when you were a little kid?   THE STOPPED CARYIN THEM AT FREDDYS!  I was SO mad. I wanted to wear them in my hair.
