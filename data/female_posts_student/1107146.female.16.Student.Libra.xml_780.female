It's probably a painful subject on your end of the wire, so I'm going to cut it out. Plus, I talk obsessively about it, it seems, so no more.   I am really tired, and cannot wait for the stupid weekend to get here. Lord, let it come.  Hey, I did pretty good on the essay in Bayrd, I was pleased with myself. Our perios (yes, "perios", and Will can attest to the following) had really hard prompts. So I figure I'm almost set in that department. But as for English...stupid asshole Kelly...  Has everyone felt that extreme coldness that makes your damned fingers swell and you can't really do anything besides flex them irregularly? Man, that's me right now. I can't type either, and it's becoming annoying, so I'm going to quit trying.  Grr! and Brr!
