Can't wait to get into the car and drive with the November Mix.  Yes, we name our mixes after months; got a problem??  We do seasons too!  Good god, such a great one hon!  Who knew Dido was so great?   WHO??  Tired to listen to the Tori B-Sides mix, but only got to the 3rd song before I had to just shove November back in.  Currently on "When You're Stoned"...it's my instant favorite.  Seriously jumped when her voice started after the great instrumental background.  And then fucking "Honey" after that...WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU???? And as for "Love Him".....GGGGRRRRRRRRR!!!!!! Have to say, hearing the Cranberries' "Can't be with You" on the mix was kinda bittersweet.  Recognized the intro immediately, but for the life of me couldn't figure out what the hell it was.   Once the lyrics began, I was back in my old room in the mountain fortress, 14, on the blue carpet playing UNO with Tracy.  Oh yea.   To be followed by only Madonna song that makes me feel like I'm Seattle in summer just as much as "Hollywood." So basically, the whole damn things rocks the cock all the way to the moon, honey.  Really.   And I didn't intend this entry to so closely resemble an email, but what the hell?  And yes, Track 9 totally knocked me down.  Sniff!
