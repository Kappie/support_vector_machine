YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!! It was all very exciting because i had just discovered that he's playing for Team Finland in the World Championship and he had already scored a goal on that day!!!  yay for one of my most fave finns!  Alright so here's the update:  Friday: 12 HOUR NINTENDO-A-THON!!!!!!!  Me, Lindsay, Katy and Caroline (primarily) but with other people too played for 12 hrs.  Lindsay made it the full 12, i made it to about 9, and Caroline made it 8.....Katy i think made it to 10.  We played a million games of Mario Kart 64 and about half a million games of Mario Party 2.  We also played this one big game of Super Smash Brothers where i DEFEATED Spenser Samms and that game is supposed to be the game that he is the master of and i BEAT HIM!!!!  Nathaniel told him that he lost all honor because he lost to a girl.  muhahaha.  Then I played Nathaniel at Mario Kart and whipped his ass twice in a row.  He was all saying that it wouldn't happen again blah blah had he not had to leave early.  psh whatever.  it was a neck and neck game the first one and then i almost lapped him the second time.  The first game of Mario Party i won because i actually tried just like everyone else, but the next game i wasn't even paying attention too, i was just pushing buttons basically....i won it!!!  it was crazy.  I finally fell asleep at 3 or 4am....so maybe that was 9 hrs... i dunno but it was fun!  Saturday:  Lindsay drove me home and then i went right back upstairs and fell asleep.....and slept until about 2:15pm....and here i am.....and i'm probably not going to do anything else all day.  Tomorrow i go to Local Diner with Nathaniel because i need to talk to him about stuff.  It'll be tons of fun.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
