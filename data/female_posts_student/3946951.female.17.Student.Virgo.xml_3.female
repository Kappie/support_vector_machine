Well sonny, back in my day when I was a beautiful and a fabulous girl of seventeen, I shook hands with Congresswoman  Denise Majette ."       "Oooooo... Aaaahhh... Really , grandma Stefanie Depp?"        That's right, sweetie.      I was down at  Albany, Georgia  again with The Godfather and my mother yesterday for our final panal meeting for a bid on this huge project for my mom's company. Well, conveniently,  Denise Majette , who is currently running for a senatorial position, was there. She's a wonderful woman. Smart and a brilliant speaker (though I suppose anyone brave enough to become the  first  female, African-American  Senator  of Georgia has got to be a brilliant speaker).      Granted, during her wonderful speech, I was particularly busy swatting gnats, squishing ants, and fanning myself from the cruel southwest Georgian  humidity , and probably missed half of what she was saying in the process. Either way, from what I managed to pay attention to, I'm quick to decide that she is a very awesome person. After all, anyone who was an undergrad of  Yale  and graduated out of  Duke 's School of Law, then becoming a famous judge  has  to be worth the recognition. Plus, she's female and a minority.       Two thumbs way, way up! :)    If you're an American citizen, a Georgian, and at least the age of eighteen, then  vote  for her. I probably will when September 17 rolls along.      Oh. For anyone who's curious but too lazy to  Google , that's her :
