I can see that he is a hard worker, and I dunno if I should rejoice or cry... Standards are up now! Yikes! Anyway just 2 more semesters and I'll be working... More responsibilities awaits me...  But I know I will survive!  I'm ready to go! Bring it on!  Tomorrow is payday! Am going to Sentiments to collect my long overdue pay! Cya!
