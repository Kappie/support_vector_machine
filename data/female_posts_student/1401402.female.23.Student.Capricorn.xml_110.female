I woke up shedding tears, holding my pillow tight, cuddling so close to Alyssia and I also had a knife under my pillow just in case. I have never waked up from a dream being this scared in my life. I felt like a mouse that was trap in the corner with a bunch of big fat cats surrounding me with no place to escape.     Now we all know that Miss Sakdary has been working very late at night, it’s always so dark by 7:30 or 8pm outside walking towards my car. It’s a good thing that I carry a bottle of MACE with me all the time.. Anyone dares to mess with me I’ll kick you in your balls and spray mace in your eyes, to top it off I’ll lift a garbage can near by and dump it over your head. Oh, and I’ll also cog a big chunk of loogie and spit it rite on your face.   Here’s how the dream hunt me:  I was working late on night walking towards my car and three men walked up to me the next thing I realized that I was locked up inside a mansion surrounded by mafia’s with guns. There were other women with me as well, we totally realized that we we’re kidnapped. That was the last time I saw all the other women.  We were separated one by one to different rooms. There was this Hispanic man who came into my room and told me why they have kidnapped me. It was because of my looks, that I was beautiful. Their plan was to rape every single one of us and then sell us to people who wanted us.   After that I was attack!!! I was aware of the situation, I try to fight back, but every time I do, I was abused. I was hurt every time. I scream for help, I yelled, I cried but they didn’t let this innocent girl go. I was so scared.  Once I woke up, I was in fear shaking in tears. Staring into my digital clock it was 3:31 am, I couldn’t get back to sleep, I didn’t want to sleep. I wish never to dream of anything like this ever again. I didn’t get back to sleep until five this morning. Until now I am still kinda paranoid.
