Its really been affecting my sleep schedule and my emotions..things as such. for some reason, ive just been really easilly depressed and stuff..i was watching the news last night, and all the stories made me want to break out in tears. mostly it was because so much of it was about shootings and car accidents and things like that. then there was a somewhat national news storie of a plane in colorado that crashed in a residential area. I almost cried! i remember when i heard about that jet crashing at an airshow in ukrain last year, i bursted out in tears. it was really sad because the jet malfunctiond, and the pilots ejected and lived, but some 80 or more people on the ground werent so lucky. i remember watching the explosion on a old black and white TV of my gradpas at his house before we sold it. we were re-doing my grandpas house before he passed away, getting it ready to sell, and we had that old TV sitting on the fire place thing, on the local news. i was already emotionally choked out because my grandpa was going to die soon, and then i saw the news, and for some reason, seeing it in black and white and actually watching the impact just really hit me. for some reason, when i see the aftermath of something like that it just doesnt bother me as much. Im really glad i didnt see the jets hit the towers on september 11th. I think i would have layed in bed crying for a long long time. but the thing that was even more sad about that, was that i didnt hear what exactally had happend until around 1:40 pm that day at school. and i can remember all to well exactally what it was like when i did.    *sigh*......i just dont know what to think of this all. God has thrown a lot of things at me in the past 4 years. i just try to think that it could be a lot worse. i just hope it dosnt end up really bad.   *snaps back to present time* in other news, ive been in band practice for a week now. this week is promising to be a hard one. doing marching an all, playing music out the butt. this comming week is known as HWMBME Hell Week for all Marching Band Memebers of Elida(my school)..usally just plain Hell Week.   The reason for the name, is because we do all the intense playing and preparing for Band Camp. which is next week. Band camp is where we learn our marching shows and memorize the music. We go to a 4H camp and stay there for a week, oppose to what most area bands band camp is: our Hell Week. We are quite proud of our bands marching. We do harder marching than most area high school marching bands. the only way we get better then the common bands  around is by having 3 weeks of hours of practice a day. all this week from monday to thursday we will have 4 hours of band pracice a day, and at band camp, we have all day of band practice, minus breakfast, dinner, supper, sleep, and free time.   ger..have to go..bye
