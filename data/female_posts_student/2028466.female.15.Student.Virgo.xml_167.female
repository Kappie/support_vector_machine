She pushes the shadows away; Prays for a good day; Locks her misery behind the door; Throws the key at the floor.  Watches her pain melt away, Crumble up, and decay. Lifts her face to the sky, As she wipes the tears from her eye.  She's starting her life over, Crawling from her cover. Lifting hands, giving praise, As she thanks God for this new day...
