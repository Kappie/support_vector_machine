Here are some of my favorites: *Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No wait... not me, you. *The face of a person can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face. *I wonder why people do drugs. I mean if everyone wants to feel good, why can't we all just have sex? *I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it at all. *Why do shops have a sign on the door 'Guide dogs only'. Who is supposed to read it? The dog? *Why do people say, "If only I had a nickel for everytime I heard that". Why not say, "I wish I had 1 billion dollars for everytime I heard that." Think about it, which way do you make more money? *Bums have great lives. They get drunk, and stagger around town asking people for money. Free money while your drunk! How great is that? So why do people feel bad for them? *Take the time to go out and appreciate life. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, taking all your things. *We saw a young boy who got splashed by a mud puddle on the way to school. Driving away, we saw him wondering if he should go home and change, but be late for school, or go to school the way he was with dirt all over him drenched in dirty, mud water. Well, while he tried to decide, we drove by and splashed him again to give him a little incentive. *I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it. *Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door. *I hope that someday we will be able to put away our fears and prejudices and just laugh at people.  alright...I think that will be enough...haha.
