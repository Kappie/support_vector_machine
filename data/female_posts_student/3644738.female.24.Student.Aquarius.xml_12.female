But worse than that was the fact that the Air Stewards had no concept of "respecting ones personal space" I had a chose between these two options (like in "Fight Club") either their crotch or butt IN MY DAMN FACE!!!!!!!!!!!  Once or twice I would have been okay with it but it was every bloody time they walked down the aisle.....Even when I was standing in line to use the toilet one UA stewardess just walked straight into me..but I didn't say anything because I ‘m not even trying to get done for "Air Rage" like Adam Sandler in "Anger Management" .............Boy don't even let me get started about the way they kept knocking the cart into my person....I got to the point where everytime they passed I got scared.....especially when they started serving tea and coffee because prior to that, one steward had spilt mineral water down my arm!!!!!!!!  YES IT IS ALL ABOUT VIRGIN......GOD BLESS RICHARD BRANSON AND NO PLACE ELSE (Head of State).  Okay so I get to the immigration after the horrible flight only to come face to face with the Immigration officer from the lower echelons of HELL.....Check this guy out...."What is the purpose of your visit?"  I'm like fair enough question so I answer "To visit my family"...."How long will you be staying here?" Another expected question ...."10 weeks" I reply....Here's where it starts going pear shaped....."10 weeks that a long time to visit family!!!!"  Boy knowing how these people are I do the best thing I can and shut what they call the fuck up......Then a barrage of questions follow...this time I'm seeing the other passenger flying by but here I am stuck...I thought this MF was going to book an interview room / or deny entry ...OR BOTH!!!!  What do I do in London? What degree am I studying? etc.....Then he spends quite some time looking at the computer screen which from my angle is nothing but a black screen, so right now I'm anxious cos it would be damn shame to come back to England after an eight hour flight.....Anyway after what seemed to be an eternity he lets me go.....Phew!!!!!!
