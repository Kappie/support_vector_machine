Down inside I felt Something I would never forget It made me happy and it made me sad Deep inside It remains Reminding Once I had Once you gave me The unforgettable touch of you. Is much too deep For time to erase Is much too strong For me to forget No end will be achieved Though deep changes were made We’re not free to feel it We’re not free to show it We’re not free to live it  It hurts to hide It hurts to ignore But is good to recall Once we were happy together Today we will be happy somehow A kiss to you, my special one.
