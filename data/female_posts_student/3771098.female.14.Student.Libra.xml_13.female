I also ran into the redfearns and a bunch of friends from school I haven't seen since May. That was pretty cool. Then I got to go to youth group which was awsome cuz i got to see some people that went on SD which i haven't seen in days, which feels really weird considering i practiclly lived with these people for 12 days. Then after youth group amez and me headed over to her place and waited for Michael to come pick us up. He came and got us, and then we headed over to Anchor Lanes to go bowling. Once we got there (around 9ish) we parked to wait for someone when Greg Moore pulls up. How the hell he found us, no one knows. All I know is absolutely everyone hates this guy, including me, so we decide to try and loose him. We drove all over the place, and just when we thought he would follow Nick into Quail Valley, he continues to tail us until we got to Rush's. Then Michael locked his keys in his car, so he had to get a ride to his house with Greg (poor michael) while me and amez rode with Nick back to go bowling. Well, as it turns out, Michael didn't really lock his keys in the car, he just pretended he did so we could loose Greg. Go Michael! It was an ingenious plan.  So we bowled. It was actually a lot of fun, even though i knew like 5 people. Oh by the way, i wore white shorts which glow under black light. A huge mistake considering everyone with a penis was staring at my ass. Also, I have fake nails on right now, so bowling is muy deficil. Other than that it was an awsome night. Amez has found a new friend. Haha, if you know what i mean. Well that's about it. I think we might be doing something Saturday night but who knows. Caio-   Liz
