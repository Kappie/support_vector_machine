Today we have to go to my grandmas house because it's her birthday. Yuck.  We have to like do something on this quilt she almost finished before she got all sick and couldn't remember how to quilt.  Hmm.  I am tired and I feel sick.  Not to mention tomorrow is the....   DAY OF DOOOM!!!  *creepy sci-fi music plays in background*
