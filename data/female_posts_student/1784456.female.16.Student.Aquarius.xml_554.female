Ahhh perfect moment - As soon as we get into school we're greeted with the site of Lisa Boden screaming because she's covered from head to foot in foam! We managed to catch a few simple phrases like "My hair!" and "Eeeeek!" and "Rick Sims!" Twas funny.  Eeek Russian was scary. All these weird letters! The teacher was cool, but its hard! It was funny cause Mr.Wiltshire was supposed to be listening to the teacher and writing stuff down like we all were, but instead he was talking and giggling and playing with his pen and doodling on his book! Then he scrunched his paper up into  ball and started playing with it! I thought we were supposed to be the kids!
