There's so many cool 80's references in it. I wasn't born in 1985 (Rachael was)..but I was born two years after that (Two and a half more months till' my birthday!). I love how they talk about U2(!), Duran Duran, Pretty in Pink, and Bruce (!!!)..so yeah here are the lyrics!!  Woohoo  Woohoo   Debbie just hit the wall  She never had it all  One Prozac a day  Husbands a CPA  Her dreams went out the door  When she turned twenty four  Only been with one man  What happen to her plan?   She was gonna be an actress  She was gonna be a star  She was gonna shake her ass  On the hood of white snake’s car  Her yellow SUV is now the enemy  Looks at her average life  And nothing has been alright   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985   Woohoo  (1985)  Woohoo   She's seen all the classics  She knows every line  Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink  Even Saint Elmo's Fire  She rocked out to wham  Not a big Limp Biscuit fan  Thought she’d get a hand  On a member of Duran Duran   Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin  And who’s the other guy singing in Van Halen  When did reality become T.V.  What ever happen to sitcoms, game shows  (on the radio there was)   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985   Woohoo   She hates time make it stop  When did Motley Crew become classic rock?  And when did Ozzy become an actor?  Please make this stop  Stop!  And bring back   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 1985   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985
