The camping trip was FANASTIC, minus the fact I was stupid and fell asleep in the sun with sunblock! Crispyyy... My friends Kevin and Jesse didn't get even a little burnt. I must have gotten their share. I'm not bitter... i swear... *Growls*  This camping adventure has allowed me to get to know my friends a little better, being than some of them are headed off to school. To be a little sappy, I'll miss you guys more than you can imagine. You guys are my big brothers, and I love you! *Hugs*  I'll leave it on that lovey dovey note!  A.H
