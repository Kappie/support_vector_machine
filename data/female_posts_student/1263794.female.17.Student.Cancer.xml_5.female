First things first. The new harry potter book came out like a day ago. I must say I was quite excited about this. It's only been like 2 years since I sat up till 3am buried in the Goblet of Fire and I'm looking forward to the lack of sleep again. I'll also admit that I was one of the dorks that went to the Harry Potter parties (yes HARRY POTTER PARTIES) at the local bookstores. In fact I WENT TO 2!. (Borders and Barnes and Nobles) Now I can honestly say I was expecting to see one possibly two people I recognized but to my surprised I saw about eight people that I knew well. Not aquaintances but actual friends. I thought this was HILARIOUS as I figured I must be a dork for even considering going to one of these. It's amazing how many people hide their love for Harry. The "parties" were actually quite fun and the book is great so far, so far meaning only page 100 or so. I keep having to switch  off between this stupid summer reading, which brings me to another topic. Raleigh Charter is ruining me without even being in session yet. Everyones leaving, summer assignments are driving me crazy, and it is giving me absolutely nothing to look forward to junior year. I believe Junior year is supposed to be one of the best but I'm not sure how that's gonna happen. Southeast is looking better and better as well but I have a feeling I'm STUCK HERE as it is probably way too late to register. Siiiiiiiigh.   I got some of those bubbles that don't pop today. You know those things are really fun. It really brings out the "girly-girl" in people which I find HILARIOUS. They run away from those bubbles like their acid. There was like a million of them in my hair, and I'm pretty sure it was driving Rachael crazy as I didn't bother to attempt to remove them. I didn't care though I think their fun. I mean unpoppable bubbles, what's not to love?! Definitely a good investment.   O YEAH. I got my blue belt a couple days ago. The testing went great. I didn't mess up bad like last time, but I did cut my foot on my breaking. It was nasty I looked down and there was huge puddle of blood beneath my foot. It scared me at first but then I found myself laughing at the thought of someone else standing in it. I am aware that sounds pretty gross but you gotta admit it's kinda funny. Anyways I now have the prettiest belt I've had yet.   Well that's not even close to all that's been going on but it is 1:40 in the morning and I have to leave SOMETHING for  tomorrow or (today). Not to mention I have to get busy on my English reading. GOOD NIGHT.
