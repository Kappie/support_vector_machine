I have officially finished my first year of medical school (of course, this is assuming that I passed all of my recent exams and have a "passing" average). I find this mind-boggling. Granted, this year has been intense and the information I supposedly "learned" and the "work" that I apparently did was definitely a years-worth, but, dude, I totally don't feel like I'm 1/4 of the way there.  And, besides that, what the hell am I supposed to do with myself now? Coming back to my room after the exam, I found myself with nothing to do. I guess that's a *good* thing.
