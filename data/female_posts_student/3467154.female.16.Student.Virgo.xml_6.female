Am leaving for Cebu Monday so I might not be able to blog in a week. And today is Em's party. It looks like will be doing indoors stuff instead of outdoors cuz of the rain. Anyways, if you are in an insufficient relationship these are in a joke-manner way to dump your boyfriend (for ladies only):  1. Tell him you want commitment 2. Tell him your pregnant
