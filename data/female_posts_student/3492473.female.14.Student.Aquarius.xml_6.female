And I don't feel depressed about them anymore." But later in the day, because of  one  person, I felt miserable again. All the feelings I thought I had gotten out from writing, rushed back in and made me feel like shit. And what feeling decides to come back and be just as strong as before?  My feelings for Chris.  He said sorry, we're friends, yeah, end of story, right? Wrong. I'm still upset about a lot of things and my heart is still broken. Being friends doesn't replace the emotional attachments we had together. Lately, I've been in one of those stages  where everything reminds me of him!  Especially this song, (So Much For) My Happy Endings by Avril Lavigne. Check out the lyrics:  So much for my happy ending  oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Oh oh, oh oh, oh...  Let's talk this over  It's not like we're dead   Was it something I did?  Was it something You said?   Don't leave me hanging  In a city so dead  Held up so high  On such a breakable thread    You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be    CHORUS   You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Oh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends  I know what they say  They tell you I'm difficult  But so are they  But they don't know me  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do   You were all the things I thought I knew  And I thought we could be   CHORUS    It's nice to know that you were there  Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all  Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done    CHORUS X 2   oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh...  All the bold parts are parts that describe how I feel... "Was it something I did? Was it something You said?" It's like, Why did we break up? What happened? "You were all the things I thought I knew, And I thought we could be" I thought we'd last. "You were everything, everything that I wanted, We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending"  He was everything I wanted.  And now the memories are gone... Whether or not he was actually pretending, it sure as hell felt like it when he dumped me. "It's nice to know that you were there. Thanks for acting like you cared. And making me feel like I was the only one. It's nice to know we had it all. Thanks for watching as I fall, And letting me know we were done." I really thought he cared, I really felt like the only one, we really did have it all. He did watch me as I fell and just kept on watching...
