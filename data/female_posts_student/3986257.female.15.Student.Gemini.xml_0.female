     
      There is glitter where you are A spotlight in the dim hallway And there are people creeping in the shadows that you are not aware of.  You are lost, lost in your own perfection, While I silently wait for you to snap out of yourshining world and into the hands of yourover- the- edge admirers, Blind to their own jealousy.  And it seems that I can't stand here another minute.  So when I run off, Don't be alarmed, just be afraid. I'm not protecting your useless causes anymore.
