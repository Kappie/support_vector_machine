And then in chorus, Gibson totally bitched anthony out today, I felt so sorry for the kid. I think she heard me talking about her, too. Meh, its ok, she never liked me anyway. So yeah, thats pretty much it. I'm going to Bob's tonight...its going to be me, emily, paul and possibly jasmine. Fun stuff. I heard something about roasting peeps....whatever, lol. And then Paul's tomorrow. Fun. So I'm working the concession stand at Springfield Park three nights this summer. Nice.
