Hinata and Sasuke are my most fav. characters!  *nyaaaaaaaa...* ^.^ The characters are quite interesting and their background stories are mostly quite sad so please bear with me while i tell each of their tales one by one     Naruto is the main character of the show (duh).  He likes Sakura a lot but detest Sasuke because Sasuke is better than him.  Unfortunately, she hates him and is nearly in tears when she's put in his team.  He loves ramen noodles, is twelve and not the smartest chip off the block.  He's slow, he's stupid, he's hilarious.  He does the unexpected all the time.  Hmm...too many examples of his hilarious antics..i couldnt possibly tell all of them...watch the anime, it's really too funny.  Despite his comical and happy side, he has a sad story.  Many years ago, there was a demon fox that terrorized Leaf Village.  One of the Hokage ( strongest ninja in the village) came and sacrificed his life in order to seal the spirit of the fox inside a newborn baby.  Unfortunately, that baby was Naruto.  Naruto now lives without his parents in his own home.  Everyone hates him because they think that Naruto IS the demon fox but, in reality, Naruto is just the container.  All parents ignore him and set a bad influence on their children who in turn begin to hate Naruto for no reason.  Therefore, the Hokage made a law that no parent may talk about the demon fox and that no one must tell Naruto that the demon fox is sealed within him.  Naruto finds this out in the first episode and is shocked.  He gradually recovers and focuses on his dream, to one day become Hokage so that all villagers may acknowledge his existence and realize that he really isnt a bad person.     Sakura is a romantic and dreamy type of person.  She really likes Sasuke and dreams about kissing him and stuff like that (ahahah!  She gets so annoyed when Naruto kisses Sasuke on the lips accidentally and beats Naruto up for stealing her kiss).  She's not very good at fighting but excels in strategy and chakra ( a spiritual energy that circles around the body of a person that allows one to do amazing things like ninjutsus, self-replication and walking on ceilings) control.  She hates Naruto and wishes sometimes that he didnt exist.  She also detests Fuzzy Eyebrows (Rock Lee) but gradually builds more respect for Naruto and Rock after a while.  At one point, she takes her knife and cut off her hair because she's tired of being a useless person on the team and also to save the lives of Naruto and Sasuke.  She thinks that she spends too much time worrying about her looks when she should be practicing to fight so that she can actually save people's lives.  Supposedly, her forehead is way too big...i think it looks normal...hmm..... Her story isnt that sad.  Ino used to be her best friend but when Sakura fell in love with Sasuke, so did Ino and all the other girls.  Ino and Sakura got in a fight and have hated each other since.  I think they've been enemies for almost 10 years.     Ah, Sasuke.  The guy all the girls in the class like.  He's cool, reserved and silent.  He barely talks.  Every anime has got a guy like this.  Someone who's cool....too cool...and serious all the time.  Well, not all the time.  I especially love how they do Sasuke's chibi face.  Anyhow, he's rivals with quite a number of people...let's see...Gaara, Neji, Rock, Naruto and .....i think that's it....He really hates Naruto.  Well, almost everyone hates Naruto.  He has a sad past.  I'm not too sure but i think that...ah, yes....When Kakashi, his team trainer, asks what his goal is, he responds in a cold and sharp tone, "My goal is to kill someone that i've been after...before i die" This person is Sasuke's elder brother.  When Sasuke was a kid, he came back home and saw his mother and father corpses lying on the floor.  His brother, Itachi, was standing over their dead bodies.  Sasuke believed he was too scared and weak to protect his loved ones.  Since then, he began to think that no one could accomplish anything without being really really good at everything.  He is a genius actually.  Some say he was the genius of the Uchiha clan.  He has a special ability that is passed down his family, the Sharingan.  The Sharingan is when one's eyes turn red and you can "read" the future (actually, copy someone's moves and find out easily which one they'll use next and use it against them).  He is cursed with a seal that Orochimaru gave him recently that takes over his body when he uses chakra and turns him into a killing machine.  Orochimaru is hoping that sasuke will come to him, seeking more power.  He wants to use Sasuke as a tool to wreak havoc between all villages.  That's all i can think of now....     Hinata is the shy person in the class.  She likes Naruto and it's pretty obvious that she admires him but Naruto is too stupid/slow to realize this, he doesnt know that she likes him and often hurts her feelings without knowing.  For instance,  when Hinata finally managed to muster up the courage to tell Naruto something, she stutters and mumbles, then Naruto simply goes, "huh?" and walks away. Her white eyes are actually a more primitive and more powerful version of the Sharingan, passed down the Hyuuga clan.  It is called the Byakugan and it allows the user to see which parts of the body to hit while fighting.  The technique is the hit someone and force your chakra into their body, hitting the vital areas and kill them instantly.  It also allows one to see chakra holes, spots over the body that are the size of needle points, and hit them.  This technique allows one to either kill an opponent or control, increase, decrease and stop their chakra flow. Hinata was supposedly a runt of the family.  She was very weak and not aggressive enough.  Her own family rejected her.  Neji, a ninja the same age related to her but a part of the branch family of the Hyuuga instead of the head family like Hinata, is mean to her.  He discourages her and tells her that she can never change, that she'll always be a loser.  Naruto yells out to her and tells her to fight back.  Hinata does a good job in fighting Neji but her heart is hit by Neji's Byakugan.  She begins to spit up blood and is about to be carried away but she stand up again and keeps on trying to fight in order to prove herself worthy but is hit constantly.  I don't know what happens after but she falls on the floor and Neji wins the match.  She tries to get up but falls again.  She is then carried away by paramedics saying things like, " Hurry, she won't last for ten minutes if we don't get her treated." In the end, Hinata proved herself and tried to change herself.  She worked hard and trained.  There is a scene when she is practicing hitting a pole till it is nighttime and the pole is smudged with reddish blots of blood from her hands that are bruised and cut.  She is inspired but Naruto and how he works so hard to attain his goal.    Ahahahah...Rock Lee.  Most people just call him Lee.  His looks are funny and he is a very sappy person (*fiery eyes*  AAAALRIIIGHT!  LET'S RUN TOWARDS THE SUNSET TOGETHER!!!!!).  He really likes Sakura who is devastated by his looks (fuzzy eyebrows, bob cut hair, eyelashes and saucer eyes?  c'mon, that's almost every girl's nightmare!  Look at him for goodness sake!  Look at him!)  Despite his strange looks, I really admire his personality.  At the beginning, Lee had absolutely no talent and could only fight normally, with punches, kicks and devastating combos.  He worked hard every day and soon became a taijutsu (normal fighting) specialist.  His hands are wrapped in bandages because they are scarred and blackened from training so hard.  His legs wrapped in orange have weights underneath, but not just normal weights, they weigh a ton each!!! He's a speed devil and extremely fast.  He actually has a talent that is undiscovered until ep 50.  He is able to open gates (whatever that means).  His match with Gaara is really sad.  Lee trains really hard because he's mad that other people can be geniuses and achieve things easily without trying so this match means a lot to him since he needs to beat Gaara, a genius BTW, in order to fight people he really wanted to prove himself to...  He nearly defeats Gaara but uses a secret self-destructing combo too many times and rips his muscles.  Not only is that bad enough but Gaara attacks his left arm and leg with his sand.  Every bone in Lee's body is crushed and his arm and leg are ruined.  I was tears when I learned that Lee would never be able to fight again because of his body.  He had worked so hard to prove himself but his dream was shattered and he would never be able to complete it.  why is it that Lee lost to Gaara?  Gaara never even TRIED!  Lee worked so hard and actually deserved to win!  He would never be able to fight again.....*breaks out in hysteric sobs*
