All I did was kneel down to get my keys off the floor, and my knee did some weird twisty-cracky thing, and now it hurts like  hell  whenever I walk. I must have weak knees or something, it started hurting on the DofE exped. too. Not as bad as this though. Ow.  On the plus side, I found a cool new webcomic:  urlLink applegeeks  Check it out.
