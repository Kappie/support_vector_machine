And Josh, you may be able to use Abby's name, but I can also say, "yeah, but I'm her bestest friend, so there." And then I win the argument.  Whit graduated today:(  My baby's growing up! And Mc Nair got arrested for being stupid.  Grrrr... Oh well, he got what he deserved I guess.  Stars shouldn't get special privledges, except for maybe solitary so that they're not beat up by people who like the Raiders or something.  Hmmm, what else?  Oh, I just ate @ TGI Fridays for the second night in a row.  I'm getting sick of it.  And I'm really excited about Renfest.  And Josh, my mom didn't care that your dad was going because she said that he wouldn't be able to "protect" me from you...right.  My mom just called in here to give Will a very important message:  "You are welcome here any time as long as you bring the lobster stuff and club crackers." OK, so my mom is slightly obsessed with that stuff now.  It's almost gone.  Speaking of obsessiveness, in response to Josh's question, my mom sent these to me off a cross-stitch message board.  That's right a CROSS STITCH MESSAGE BOARD... *Sigh* Oh well, at least she's being civil again...
