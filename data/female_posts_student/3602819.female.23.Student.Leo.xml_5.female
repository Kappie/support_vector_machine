We started talking about great books we would like to read, and she brought up a book I haven't picked up in years... In fact, since my missions class in college (that would be freshman year). It's called "Rich Christians." We started chatting about what kind of society we live in today and the luxuries we have, when not two conversations before we were talking about the new clothes we wanted, or how we have so little money... (I actually don't have a lot of money, but I'm in school so I knew that was going to happen). But we got on the subject of being homeless... Which at times, I feel that is what I am. I don't have a permanent place to call my own, and because of the blessings of others, I am able to live and work and eat and worship where God wants me to be. But in this conversation, it brought to my attention of how selfish I am with the things I have, with the things I want, and with the things God has given me as a blessing.  Although the Son of Man had no where to rest His head at night, he did no worrying. God's Word tells us of the lilies of the field and the sparrow, and how God takes care of them... But there are so many times when I don't take my heavenly Father's blessing into account... I have it all... A family who loves me, friends who care about me, a church that is so wonderful that I don't want to leave, and opportunities to let my light shine for the world to see, but I don't because I'm scared someone may tell me what I don't want to hear.  So what's next? When will I stop repressing the blessings that God has given to me, and start sharing the blessing with others the wonderful gifts that have been given to me... Hopefully, I will wake each day to give and find new blessings that are poured out. Only time will tell what's next in my life... Hopefully God will let me see a glimmer of what is next to come... What is next that He is going to teach me about His ultimate love for me and His children.... Eyes up, Mel~
