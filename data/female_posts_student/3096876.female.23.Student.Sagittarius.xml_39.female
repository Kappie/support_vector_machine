A man that I work with, a fantastic guy by the name of Steve, left the office at lunch on Monday and didn't come back. Not surprisingly, questions about the meaning of life are rampant.   Always the last to hear about anything, Mo was at least thoughtful enough to call looking for me yesterday. She told Mom, who had to tell me this morning. Is that a way to start a day? No, but was there also a better way for Monday to go? Probably, so who am I to bitch.   I will always remember him as a guy with a ton of jokes to tell, and the sense of humour to pull off even the crappy jokes. Always leaving me Scooby-Doo sound-bites on my voicemail, or sending me funny emails. Steve was the joker that had a heart of pure gold. So pure, it would make your own melt. He hasn't been like his regular self in the last few months. A grey sort of veil settled over him and never lifted. I thought to myself a few weeks ago that for as lovely as our spring-cum-summer weather has been, he sure didn't look rosy.   What gets me the most is the issue of perspective. He was sad. That's not Steve. Mo told me that his wife said he was worried about people at work not liking him, or getting in trouble for not working hard enough. That's not Steve either. Everybody loves this man--it's impossible not to. There's not a single person I can think of that is more considerate, more mindful of others, more willing to lay themselves in front of a speeding train to help even the most vague of acquaintances. And yet, he thought that we didn't love him.   It forces me to wonder just how much was going on that he kept totally hidden from us, the people that he's worked with day in, day out for who-knows how many years. What kind of sadness causes one to seek out the ultimate solution? And what kind of shame causes one to hide their pain from those who would only want to help?   He left on Monday at lunch. His desk is still just as he left it. Papers neatly stacked here, his phone neatly tidied away there. He left knowing what was going to happen. Mo thinks he was probably planning it for some time. And that's the kind of thing that always irks the people left behind. The unending, unanswerable questions:  " How could we have missed this? "  " Why didn't we know?"    The answers were locked up inside Steve all along, and now will be his to keep forever.
