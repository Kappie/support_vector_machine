One, in all of the million billion pictures that have been taken of me.  I hear a lot of people saying they were geeky in high school, no one liked them, they were ugly, but I doubt they had the same complete lack of self confidence that I have.   B.  My brother does not have a bad mother.  I never really thought she was  bad,  but I never thought she was that great either.  She always moved around, and I know that kids need a good base, a home that they can come to.  She is wonderful as far as I can tell.  She loves Connor, feeds him, and thats what really matters.  Why I doubted this isn't really clear to me.  I guess because she "took" my brother away from me at times (my parents are divorced, as are my brother's parents) that I didn't really like her.  But I never really didn't like her...I'm lost.  C.  I will always feel at home on the road.  I was raised on the road.  (Ha!  That sounds so funny, it is only partially true.  In all actuality I traveled a lot as a child, and I guess a lot now, but as a child most of the destinations were reached by car.)  I think only really smart people/really stupid people can travel for a long time on the road.  The smart people think of ways to entertain themselves, see the value in traveling, the stupid people are too stupid to get bored...(I tried, I'm not sure how to explain my feeling on that one very well.)  D.  I can get by without people at times.  Other times I need them like air...no joke.
