I am just counting the minutes for it to be over.  when i got in my mothers car today after school, which was my first mistake, i told her i needed to go to the bank.  she asked me how i was able to get money out.  well since im 16 i had to have a cosigner and i had my grandmother with me so she was it.  well i told her that grandmother had to be there and she flipped out. apparently, i am conspiring with my grandmother to do i dont even know what. anyway it turns out ive gone to the bank cashed my check and im walking out...my mom isnt there...she abandoned me at the bank...so i walk home.  she is so mad that she cant touch my money and i dont know why.  so it turns out that my mom recieved something in the mail and she needs that to take this test and if she doesnt take the test she will lose her job.  im so flipping out right now...i may not get to move out after all...i dunno cross our fingers though...im dying to get out.
