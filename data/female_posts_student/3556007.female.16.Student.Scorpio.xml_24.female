And Hunter was having seizures or his face was turning red or he was really sick or (EDIT LATER: I actually think now that he was turning a dark dark purple)... I don' tknow. But I am sitting there watching until I or someone starts screaming to go and just hug him or hold him or something. (EDIT LATER: I think that I screamed it because I was thinking about how human touch is said to help dying and/or hospitalized people.) So tons of people from our church group (I remember seeing Andy) run at him and give him a hug. And then for some reason we have to start going to a different room, and I take his hand and start walking with him, but I am worried that Brian will see. And then he is okay, but I don't realize it until we have been walking for a while. A bit later he asks me somethign about why I have been so nice to him or something. But I only reply something along the lines of 'Well your life was at stake.'   Now there is another part to this dream that I remebered earlier today, and I don't remember now, but I just remembered this other part of my dream:   I think we are watching a movie or watching something, and I am sitting in someone's lap either Kevin or Brian I can't remember. That is so random. That is all that I know. Hmm weird. (EDIT LATER: I think that I was sitting in someone's lap watching a movie at the church when this ^ happened.)   Well back to my world history paper.
