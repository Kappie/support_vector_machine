I sound like everyone else in this generation but really this weekend a solid 4 hours was spent totally absorbed into a screen, and totally wanting more, almost like motivational speeches from a mentor or a therapy session with a psychologist...I don't officially despise my father anymore, and I don't want to drop out of school.  Now, we can see the reference.  I watched Dogville, a three hour seemingly unrelenting film about a woman who just seemed like your run of the mill pushover, I related right away....actually, it's the last scene that got me, like at the 175th minute, this movie really had me by the %$!.  Get out of Dogville, is all I could think how simple, just hide out somewhere just as you did 174 minutes ago, you don't have to go through this...turns out the victim/martyr role that Nicole Kidman played in this movie and that I play in my own full length feature film running slightly over 180 minutes, was really consumed with arrogance.  The fact that most of us let so much slip past our radars, doesn't imply that we really are shiny happy care free people, it's more the fact that standards moral, ethical, etiquette, courtesy, academic, professional, financial, emotional that we set for ourselves are well beyond what we expect from our neighbor, so why hold these people to the same flame.  We might actually consider ourselves on a higher level, capable of perfection whereas these "others" are only doing what conditions and circumstances have lead them to do...like we should appear so forgiving so easy going only because "poor guy, he just doesn't know what true love is, poor lady she may have had to live in NYC her whole life, so no wonder she's so icy and crass, oh poor boy with a family like that no wonder he behaves this way, oh poor girl, her parents neglected her so no wonder she chooses to sleep with every thing in possession of a dick."..I don't know it made me realize that if i were really equal with everyone else, and it's ironic because most would say i'm a pound or too short of a full bag of confidence, then i should be mad, and should demand my fair share, and should not be expected to be rewarded in some higher power fashion, because well i'm closer to God...I really don't know if I have to say it again, but it's a weird neuroticism that I may have introduced into my psyche, but I am arrogant with a cover of being devoid of a backbone....interesting...my father says that I need to be more like him..I resent that, a pompous demanding overachiever....but not anymore..how can I resent someone who I emulate just in a very distorted way, I want everything, but i wont step on some poor person's feet, because god only knows the traumas they have suffered these poor people who are so much worse off than me...where do I get off exactly....  Oh..and i'm not dropping out of school for sure now...not because medicine is where the undercover narcissists go, but because i watched this Discovery Health show tonight about residents, about how each person in this field is quirky, is stressed, is full of self doubt, is just plain guessing, feels overworked and underpayed, always wondering what they signed up for even at the point of residency, full of anguish in their personal lives (i.e. cheating husbands, boyfriends who beg that tonight something too traumatic won't happen to end the relationship...again...)coincidentally all the featured residents were women tonight..they were all so content with a day's work too, not content like I saved the world, but whoa I didn't have a breakdown because I was way too busy helping 20 people today...dude it sounds like my life at this very moment (minus the helping 20 people thing, I'm way too busy getting their Date of Births and Chief Complaints)...I simply don't belong anywhere else...not fabulous enough to be a lawyer, no poker skills to be in business, and simply not happy enough to be a teacher..however i guess anguish always serves as fuel for HOLLYWOOD...if all else fails...here I come....but for now, I love my future job...
