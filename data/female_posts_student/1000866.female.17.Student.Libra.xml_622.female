There's so much about it and so many inside jokes that just can't even write all about them. Our bus driver was INSANE! Ah, good times, good times. I'm really tired from the trip though. We actually did a lot of stuff. We went to Arlington, the Lincoln memorial, the war memorials, we went on this tour of the city with this crazy feminist lesbian tour guide, we went to the international spy museum!! We went to the Smithsonion, and we went on this nice little cruise thing the last night we were there. It was all really really nice. :) I had a good time with people. I didn't even really get annoyed with anyone.  Some strange stuff happened and I got a lot of thinking done and i realized a lot of stuff too. Good times, good times. Anyway, I have a million homework assignments to do so...off I go, tra la la...
