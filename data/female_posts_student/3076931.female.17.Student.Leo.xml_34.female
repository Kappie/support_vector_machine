So I've been hanging out with an old friend lately..and so we decided to hang out last night..and as me and my old friend were "watching a movie", my mom decides to walk in on us. Yeah it was not the best of times in my house last night. But my mom's cool now. Aghhh how embarrassing. I'm scarred for life. Moms just aren't supposed to know those things about their daughters. I feel so bad for the guy, I think my mom scared the shit out him...cuz shecan be apretty scary lady.    Maybe I shouldtake a break from all this...I don't want to saypromiscuity..but it's something like that. I need to just be good again for a little while. Just sit back and kick it. I dunno. Easier said than done right? It's weird because I've found that lately when I get the thing I want, I don't want it anymore. Why is that? I guess I just want what I cant have, and when I realize that I can get it, I'm just over the idea of it and want to move on to something else. aghhhhhhh.
