Then I tried to sleep  was awakened by their loud voices.. Ok nvm.. I attempted to sleep again.. kids(some of my cousins' children) started playing games in front of me. Alright I give up. I took out my handphone played bowling.. Haha the sound effect it gave out made so many people look back  stared at me. Soon after... we went home.. we were at the house for like about 3 hours? Yupz... But my brother left halfway to go to his girlfriend's house to visit her parents. Bet he's got more red packets than me now.. -.- Hehe.. ok ... tomorow I'll be going to some parent's friend's house  I hope it's not boring.. :P
