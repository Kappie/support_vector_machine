I don't know where I know it from and so it really starts annoying me.  I  urlLink google  some of the lyrics and it turns out its an old slave song and then I start to remember this one time when I was in either 3rd or 4th grade that I had to do this weird project.  My mom brings me to school on a Saturday and there are just about 15 of us kids sitting around.  They read us a book called   urlLink Follow The Drinking Gourd  .  Its a book about the Underground Railroad.  Then they teach us this song and we have to sing it and the whole time its being filmed.  At the end of the singing and dancing they bring us into a room and they give us some  urlLink Martinelli's Apple Juice  (I remember because they have a cool lil jug) and some of those Danish butter cookies.  After all of this we are asked questions about what we thought about the story and about some of the other books they had there for us to look at.  That is all I can really remember.  Upon questioning my mom about this she told me it was for some educational video, she has no copy of it (I'd love to see it and if I can ever find it I'll try and upload clips of a little 8 or 9 year old me probably in sweat pants with my red Sally-Jesse Raphael glasses on) but thought it sounded like a "fun" thing to do.    I wonder what the  hell  made me think of that this morning.  I should probably stop hitting the crackpipe so hard before bed.
