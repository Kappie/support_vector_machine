Partially, because I have no idea what I am going to share with y'all today. Okay, that's not true. I know what I'm goind to say, I just don't know how. I guess...   I have a friend, who for the sake of privacy, I am going to call her Annie. Annie's a sweet girl just a little lost and craving love and attention. I know, newsflash, isn't the entire world. But Annie has had a particularly bad time with things. She has a good home and a great family who loves her, but she's incredibly unhappy, or at least she was when she started drugs. She's doing better now, and she only cuts on the rare occasion. (yay)   But as a Christian, I recognize that as not being enough, especially since the only one who is keeping her from drugs and cutting is her boyfriend. We all know how stupid and unpredictable boys are. So I just told her one night online (at close to 12 mind you) that I wish she had something a little more constant. Of course the question came, what could be more constant. And of course, my answer was Jesus.   Oh great, now there's a can of worms that I just opened. But she actually didn't flip out on me like I expected. On the contrary, she just said thanks, she knows I want her to have 'good things' but she's okay right now. So then I said something along the lines of 'I don't know about good things, I just don't really want you to go to Hell.' and then she asked why that would happen, because she's a pretty good person; sure she hurts herself, but she doesn't hurt others a whole lot. At least, she tries not to.   But it was so insane. I mean, I got to totally share Christ with her. I gave her the '4-1-1' on Christianity, salvation, Jesus, God, sin. You know? And hello?! It was all over IM.  IM!!  Who honestly shares Christ over the internet at midnight?! It was almost 1 when I finished and stold her I was going to bed.   It was just so amazing because the week before Derek and Kari talked about being Jesus here, and not just on mission trips. They said that we need to bring the mission field back to our school and share Christ with everyone. And it's hard, they know. I mean, they're only seniors. But I just kinda scoffed when Kari said something about, not waiting for the opportunity but creating it. I figure, God creates the opportunity, not me, I'll just take it and run with it when He gives me something.   Oh, He gave it to me alright. I never thought I would share Christ with Annie. I always thought she would tell me no, she didn't want to hear it. And then I told her how much Jesus loves her just 2 nights ago. I may have made that comment about having Jesus as a constant in life, but even that wasn't me. That was God. I got offline and just couldn't stop thinking about it. I've seen God work in crazy ways before, but never like this.   The whole thing was God. I could do nothing to start something like that, I could do nothing to open up Annie's heart and make her willing to listen. That was God. My words were God. I saved the conversation and reread it yesterday. Holy Cow*, I could never say those kind of things on my own, not unless I planned them ahead of time!   So I guess all I have to say is, yea Annie may not have become a Christian. But for some reason, God used me ( me of all people) to show Him to her with some text in a little window on Monday morning. I think it's really cool when you can see God work like that. It's not very often, but it happens once in a while. So guys? just keep trying. Because you don't have to do anything, God will give you the time and the words to say. He did for me. And trust me, it will come up in places you never thought possible. Like IM at midnight.   luv y'all bunches and bunches! Dios le bendiga.     *sarah, yes it is a special Cow.
