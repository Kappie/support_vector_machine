I'm a very talkative person, so although the eyes are the windows to the soul, the lips present a two-way thing. They show so many moods and emotions and truths they may try to hide using their lips-it shows insecurity... I know when I fancy someone when all I could think about are their lips.. Also, a woman's sides...they lead to the hips and they beg to be touched...what do you think is so sexy about a woman? Straight guy, bisexual or gay woman? Speak your mind! ~I don't get scared easily... ;)
