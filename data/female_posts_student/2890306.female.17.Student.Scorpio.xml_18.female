Almost every opinion that you or I will ever hear in our lives will be a censored version of the truth.  I have discovered in recent days that these opinions, displayed to the world on an online journal, can have an undesirable ripple effect.  Does one  actually  want to hear another's opinion, if it be negative?  One may counter, "Yes, for honesty is the best policy."  Is it?  It may be the most ethically upright policy, but it doesn't exactly do wonders in a relationship.  "Do these pants make me look fat?"  If every man in America answered that question in accordance with the "best policy," marriage would be obsolete.  With the increased divorce rate, though, one wonders if America is becoming more and more honest with passing years.    Ah, the irony...  Thanks for letting me ramble.    Oh, one more thing.   urlLink Click here  to see something completely hilarious.  Adieu.
