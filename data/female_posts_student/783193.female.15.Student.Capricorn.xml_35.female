And then, at my violin lesson, I told my teacher that playing my piece in the Romantic style was hard, and he told me not to worry. He then went on to say that he thought I was romantic. I snorted and laughed at the same time, and snot kind of shot out of my nose and dripped there. Very, very romantic. I don't think he noticed, though, because he turned around to pick up my notebook, so I wiped it away quickly with the back of my sleeve. Woohoo, the romanic side of me had popped out again. But it's a good thing the snot didn't kind of leak out to where I couldn't feel it, but where other people could see it, because Joe Lee walked in for his lesson, and I was feeling all self-concious about my snot, because he thinks I'm a weirdo as it is, which I guess I am, but oh well. Wow, that was a really awful run-on sentence. Anyway, here's another little poem by my sister.
