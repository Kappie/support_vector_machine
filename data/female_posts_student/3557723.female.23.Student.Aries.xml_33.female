I'm sitting here now waiting for a group of university students travelling around the Pilbara in Western Australia doing free science shows for Year 10's. This is something I am involved in but since I wasn't at university studying first semester, I missed out this trip. This is called the STARtrek Science Show. It's lots of fun and you meet kids and teachers from schools from a diverse range of backgrounds.  urlLink The STAR Program   I get along with the ever fearless leader Yolanda really well. In fact I would consider her a friend and a wonderful role model. I can hardly wait to see her once again even if I am going back to Perth in two weeks and I'll be seeing her every second day or so while at uni.   Anyway back to waiting. Between 6:00PM and 7:00PM. I told you I don't like waiting. *Points to time stamp*
