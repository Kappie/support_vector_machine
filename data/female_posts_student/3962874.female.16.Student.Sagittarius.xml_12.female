Oh yeah and our friend Zack is coming too, maybe I'll get to play matchmaker! Yay! So we were coming in the door when Daniel noticed some money on the porch. It ended up being $75 dollars! I called my mom to see if she might have dropped it or if she was expecting it or something but I couldn't get ahold of her. Daniel said "finders keepers" but I don't think that will go over with my mom. He's funny.
