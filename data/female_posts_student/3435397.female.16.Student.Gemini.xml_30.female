So yesterday was fun I spent the whole day at my elementary school watching my sister play softball.  It was so fun! cept I got really bad sun burn on my face, shoulders, neck, and legs.  It was really really nice out to watch softball games!  Then I came home at around 4:00 and I didn't want to shower before a bunch of people came over but I didn't smell to yummy and I had made hamburgers, cakes and Veggies for 2 hours so I thought hell everyone will be coming over in half an hour so why not shower fast! SO I DID!!! And I smelt yummy after!!! LOL it was a nice shower it was cold and nice! I saw Michelle parsons and she doesn't really look different but she does a little she is so pretty!!!!! And she was wearing more expensive clothes then me!! So she has changed and I loved seeing her.  Unfortunately she had a really bad head ache and wanted to leave early but as she was leaving Mike showed up! I saw him from the kitchen trough the front door so I bolted around the house and ran outside down the driveway and jumped on him! Thank god I didn't kill him or make him fall because it would have hurt! LOL!  So I said goodbye to michelle and then I went back to where everyone was and after about 20min they all wanted to open presents.  I am going to tell you what everyone got me and who was all there.
