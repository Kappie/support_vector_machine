HOW??? does family mean anything to ANYONE anymore??? i mean, look at my family.. the thing between my mom and aunt is still in full swing, there haven't been any recent developments but i mean, still.. youd think they would have GROWN UP by now... but NO... people need to stop being so god damn fucking gay and start taking responsibility for their lives and their families and the problems they cause... if there is a problem you dont just walk away from it... especially if its a family... you stay and you solve it you gay ass mother fucker!!! and another thing, what is up with this whole "dying" thing...
