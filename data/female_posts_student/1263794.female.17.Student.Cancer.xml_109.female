I noticed I used to write a lot more and I enjoyed reading my long entries, so maybe I should start that again. I started this thing in the middle of sophomore year. I remember how fun that year was for me. I really think I've grown a lot though. I wish so much I could go back with the knowledge I have now, it would change so many things. I wish I could have appreciated it more back then. That's one thing I've never liked about myself, I often never really appreciate things until they're gone.
