I was actually feeling kinda depressed, just wishing that they could get to an internet cafe or Andrea and Arnulfo's and write me. Especially since I've emailed like three or four of them. It was a total God thing. Exactly what I needed to cheer me up! Yaaaaay! (and of course, he somehow managed to ask if I like Jose... lol.) So he's supposed to say hi to everyone out there for me.     I'm just so excited that I got to talk to him! yaaaaaaaaaay!
