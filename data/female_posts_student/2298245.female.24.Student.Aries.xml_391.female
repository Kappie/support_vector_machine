It will be very hard to give up the Entenmann's Rich Frosted Donuts, even after reading this.:   How can one doughnut have as much artery-clogging saturated and  trans  fat (10 grams) as nine strips of bacon? That’s what happens when you completely cover a doughnut in chocolate. Try Entenmann’s Light Donuts instead. With anywhere from six to nine grams of fat per doughnut (no more than three of them saturated), they’re not health foods. But if you’ve got to have a doughnut, they’re a lot better than the regular version.   I really, really like them.  In fact, I feel like going out to buy some right now.  I'll try to restrain myself though.  Or maybe I'll just go buy some McDonald's fries, since according to the list, they are better for you than Burger King's.    Umm...fries.
