Lewis quotes:  "God has landed on this enemy-occupied world in human form...The perfect surrender and humiliation was undergone by Christ: perfect because He was God, surrender and humiliation because He was man." --The Case for Christianity  "The Psalmists in telling everyone to praise God are doing what all men do when they speak of what they care about." --Reflections on the Psalms  "Reasoning is never, like poetry, judged from the outside at all." --A Preface to Paradise Lost  "Everything except God has some natural superior; everything except unformed matter has some natural inferior." --A Preface to Paradise Lost  "It is in their 'good' characters that novelists make, unawares, the most shocking self- revelations." --A Preface to Paradise Lost  "No doubt those who really founded modern science were usually those whose love of truth exceeded their love of power." --The Abolition of Man  "An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy." --The Abolition of Man  "Relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done..." --from a letter "To Mrs. L."   "If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?" --The Problem of Pain   "Love is something more stern and splendid than mere kindness." --The Problem of Pain   "Unless Christianity is wholly false, the perception of ourselves which we have in moments of shame must be the only true one..." --The Problem of Pain  "[God] is not proud...He will have us even though we have shown that we prefer everything else to Him." --The Problem of Pain   "Be sure that the ins and outs of your individuality are no mystery to Him; and one day they will no longer be a mystery to you." --The Problem of Pain   "Nothing is yet in its true form." --Till We Have Faces  "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world." --Mere Christianity  "If you are really a product of a materialistic universe, how is it that you don't feel at home there?" --Encounter with Light  "We are born helpless. As soon as we are fully conscious we discover loneliness..." --Transposition and Other addresses   "It was when I was happiest that I longed most...The sweetest thing in all my life has been the longing...to find the place where all the beauty came from." --Till We Have Faces   "'You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you,' said the Lion." --The Silver Chair  "A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--'Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous." --Surprised by Joy    "If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will... then we may take it it is worth paying." --Mere Christianity
