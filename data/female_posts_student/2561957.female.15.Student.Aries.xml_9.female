I mean, I feel sort of sad, still, but I'm not sure if this large stone in my heart is because it was real and I let it go, or because I just don't know how to handle this. It was just one of those nights last night, you know? He was perfectly willing to keep trying, but I just felt that I couldn't do it anymore... Now I wonder if I'd just held my tongue if things would still be alright.    The phone sits there like the Devil taunting Eve with the Fruit. He's out somewhere with friends, I'm so sure of that. I can call him to see how he's doing right now, but that'd be fairly pointless... I should just grow up and accept what I did, but it's uber-hard.    He's going to a concert tomorrow that he's been wanting to go to since... something. I just hope that I didn't ruin it for him...    If I call, I'll be smothering. Technically, I shouldn't care anymore. It's over and done with, and I shouldn't even worry.    Fuck it... Just fuck it...
