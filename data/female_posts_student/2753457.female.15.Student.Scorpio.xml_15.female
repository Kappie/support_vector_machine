The place where suddenly I become more shallow, and I start to watch network television.  The place where the majority of my time is spent in the partayy basement of ours.  Well, it's not really, but I kind of like to think so.  I had so much stuff to carry in, though, I really couldn't feel my arms.  I don't want to think about when or how I'm going to unpack my life yet again. Yeah, but I do feel a little guilty.  My mom is really a little pissed off at me, for reasons I won't go into.  It surprised me because for once, it wasn't the other way around, and for once, I can't say I blame her.  I realized that I've been a bitch to her lately, and that she's had quite a shitty time of it.  So, I decided to be nice, and put a smile on my face and a song in my heart, for her sake.  I even fed the dogs and took in the mail before I came here. My dad went to his spanish class (I really think he's trying to change fifty years of being American.  He's taking tango lessons and spanish lessons every week.  Sometimes I question the man's sexuality as well.) tonight, so I'll be home alllll alone.  Wonder if there's anything to eat around here. Well, no matter how much the newfound cable tv tempts me, I WILL NOT watch reality tv.  I actually saw a few minutes of "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance" once.  Really almost threw up afterward.  Oh, my GOD.  Could we sink any further?? Well, I'm really hungry.  If I get bored, I really may come back and write another frickin post.  As sad as that seems to me.
