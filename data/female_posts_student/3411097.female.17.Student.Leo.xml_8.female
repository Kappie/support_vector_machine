I look thru many of the pics.. And it really brought back memories of my past.. Like my recently Sec Sch and Primary Sch gathering.. Well.. Everyone change ALOT!! And everyone seems grown up.. Then thought of those sec sch days where we used to hang around LOT 1,CCKSS... Haha.. Thought of those day where ka and i went to Library to disturb "Snorlax" , putting staples under "Snorlax" sits and he ran around like crazy with the broom!! And the time where we secretly eat sweet even lollypot in class.. Ya.. Not forgetting we shot rubberbands at Mdm Wong and then act innocent... And during CCKSS Anniversary where i first get hugged by sOmEoNe.. And a long walk to LOT 1 without shoes..rEaLlY cant believe that i am so naughty with u guys.. Ya.. and the best and most successful trick that i ever done is to wrap Chilli Sauce inside the tissue and Huiping go and wipe her face...Today, i went out with yingZ.. Well.. heard abt her problems in NJC, really find that she grown up.. But then she is still the same, my best buddy.. We talk a lot, frenZ,sch,CCK days.. Haha.. cant imagine that our friendship can still be so strong after going through so much.. Oh yah.. We ate pasta mania.. Oh gosh.. The chessy pasta super cheesy... TOO CHEESY!!! Haha.. Actually today though the time we hang out together was short yet i still can feel the strong bond btw us.. Maybe its because of what we went through last 2years ago that made us treasure each other so much ba.. Haha..
