The others are random things I found on  urlLink http://www.deviantart.com . I like how it looks too.  Toes hurt. But it's only a  very small  pain. This happens every Tuesday after ballet since I forget to work with them during the week. I get to go to guitar lesson again tomorrow. Yay! I didn't practice though. Boo!  And sometime in the near future I will be getting new glasses. My old ones were lost in an "adventure" with Morgan last month. I need them to read too. Especially since I am messing around with a speed reading program on my computer and that takes more concentration.  Speaking of which, I need to be reading my book for honors english right now. I only have a few pages left. (no, I didn't procrastinate all summer, this is the second time I'm reading it. Please save me the trouble, and don't ask why)
