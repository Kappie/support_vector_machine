Here we go: I was going to my car this morning and I noticed a dog house in my neighbor's yard. I thought that was very peculiar, since I don't think that they have a dog. But then I saw this little dog sitting next to the dog house and it was the same color and it scared me. I felt really bad, cause the dog had frost growing on it, it was sad.  English was really funny. Dr. Doden said he hasn't watched TV since 1998, and I asked, "Dr. Doden, what do you do after dinner? Before dinner? AFTER SCHOOL???" Then I told them the story about my mom yelling at me and saying I sounded like a hyena, and nobody laughed. Oh well.  Then, third period, Mr. O'Grady yelled at me. I almost cried, it was really scary. Usually if somebody is talking, he'll just shush them and say we need to move on. But today he was reviewing WWII and asked me a question. I didn't know, and I looked at my notes, but he said it was from a long while back. But I didn't answer quick enough, and Katie gave him the answer. Then I was asking Katie a question on something, and Mr. O'Grady said, "Allison, you obviously don't get this, so you need to be quiet." I was so surprised he said that, it was really scary.  In chemistry, people kept talking about NYU, my dream school, and how it's so fashionable and now Mary-Kate and Ashley are going there and so on. I was saddened, because I'm nothing like them, and yet I want to go there because it's like one of the best business schools in the country. So I felt very discouraged. Then somebody asked me to copy their homework. I HATE THAT. I was up at 10:30 doing it, and she got to sleep, and now she can just use my work. OOOH I was sooo annoyed, she even had study hall before class to do it herself. That was just upsetting, I hate that.  Erica and I went to give blood during study hall. We ended up missing Spanish. Chair nazi sat in her chair and complained forever! There was nothing wrong, and she was fine, but she wouldn't move at all! This was our second time, and we weren't worried, but it got really bad. Erica was before me, and when she had finished giving, she started to feel really sick. They put a bag under her, in case she threw up. I was worried, and I didn't know if she had thrown up, because she wasn't speaking. Then when I was finished, all of a sudden I got completely messed up. They laid me back, and it was like everything in my stomach was swirling, I know that doesn't make any sense. I was breathing really heavily and I started to get really nervous that I would also throw up. But we were both okay. Amy threw up and Maria passed out. It was really bad for people. Lauren gave her blood in like five minutes and then was messed up. I don't know, it was a bad day to give blood. Then I got completely crazy and was talking about the valence above the window at my seat. I mean this bus had a window and a valence! AHHH I was going crazzzy! But then we went and ate a lot in the mansion- it was nice.  When we were heading back inside, we tried to go through the door in front of the theater. Some freshman had to let us in, then one said, "Uh I need to see your visitor badge" and was trying to be funny. Erica said, "Uh, you're a freshman!" I laughed really hard.  I had health and we watched a movie on drugs. Afterwards, we were talking about the punishments for drugs and we thought marijuana shouldn't be as harsh. I said, "Ms. Faidiga, can't we all just be guaranteed one joint? You know we are all going to do it!" AHH IT WAS THE BLOOD LOSS THAT MADE ME SAY IT! We went back to the commons, and one of the leaders had tossed that fake boob all the way to the ceiling of the commons, it was amazing! I got really depressed on the way home. It's these stupid bastard elections. When I was walking out to school, Mr. O'Grady was directing traffic, and I got nervous since he yelled at me today. But all he said was, "You better tell somebody you are running." Why do we have to talk about elections at all times? The only time I talk about it is when people bring it up. My mom thinks everyone just doesn't like me, and I feel the same way. It's so agitating. But she did say that if I lose, we are becoming RADICAL. If I lose the election, I am going out that night and getting my nose pierced, my mom said Zazu can deal with her, cause she doesn't care! My mom said I have to get pierced and tattooed and I am going to be really bad. It will be funny if it happens. So I'm stressed, and I haven't started homework, and it's almost 9. I watched  Chocolat  and enjoyed myself. Thank you, goodnight.
