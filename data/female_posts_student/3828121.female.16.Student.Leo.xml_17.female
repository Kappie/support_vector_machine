But it was very tiring and very very hot. not a fun way to spend fourth of july  then, mom and me went to the store. we bought some fireworks. i dunno knwo why, b/c neither of us really care for them.  I went by Best Buy to get the new Breaking Benjamin cd. It was on sale for $6.99....of course, i get up there and they're sold out. *angry little pony* and the stock boy said that when they get more in, they'll be like $15 or something *livid little pony!* yea, sara deosn't pay that much for ANY cd, no matter how bad she wants it.  but their was a REALLY fine guy in the parking lot...*smile*  we're going to dye my hair tonight. back to dark brown. yay! no more blonde!!!!
