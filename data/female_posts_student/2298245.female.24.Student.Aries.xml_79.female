It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be, so I have gone from thinking that I might fail to thinking I could get at least a B...so here's hoping.  Thanks for the prayers of those who provided them...I think they really helped.    Now I'm on to studying for my third exam.  There is truly no rest for the weary...
