So I will compromise.  Some of this material I will send to both.  I hope that doesn’t cheapen the content.  After all, the best letters create a private, intimate space; the letter writer simultaneously conveys both a sense that she set aside a good amount precious time out of her busy life, just to write just to you and that the lost time can hardly be considered a sacrifice since since she cares for you so greatly that she couldn’t possibly not write to you.  Blogs, at least the online-diary types like this one, are, for the most part, public glimpses into isolated anonymous lives that choose to write to the world only in the hopes of finally feeling at home in it. 	Anyway, where should I begin?  Probably by describing Mr. Rod.  Let’s back up 13 months ago.  I was DEVESTATEDLY (I didn’t mean intend to type that in All-caps, but sometimes my capslock button goes psycho and turns on or off by itself, which it is doing right now.  Anyway, it came out allcaps, and I decided I liked the way it looked so I kept it) in love with and heart broken over an emotional fuckwit named Andy.  Mr. Andy, is the original fuckwit, call him fuckwit #1, or just #1 for short.  I won’t go into the story of #1 right now (incidentally, my keyboard is going all crazy; the cursor is jumping everywhere, the capslock is going on and off, random sections of text are being highlighted—this makes it very difficult to type).  The point is that I was heartbroken.  It was also the birthday of my friend, Bryan.   I met Bryan’s roommates for the first time at his birthday dinner (I guess he is too old for parties in his mind): Devon, Eric and… Rod.  Devon hit on my shamelessly.  But he reeked of being a player and of, well, he just plain reeked in the literal sense.  Eric fussed with his girlfriend, who I don’t think liked me very much.  And Rod and I got into some argument over music.  It wasn’t really an argument from my perspective, but I think he was actually offended and obviously did not care for me.  Fast forward a couple of weeks later when Andy and I finally broke up (after a long, drawn out process of fighting, him avoiding me, me nearly stalking him and then giving up completely and dumping him).  The night of the break-up I drank a half-bottle of codine cough syrup, three long island ice teas and ended up nearly passed out in devon’s rat’s nest of a bed room.  He kept trying to put his hand my skirt, I would let him get only so far before I mustered up the strength to push his hand away.  I wouldn’t kiss him because I had thrown up earlier in the evening. Eric had been kind enough to give me  a new toothbrush, but still, vomit is vomit and I didn’t feel like kissing anyone after that.  Also, as good looking as devon is, he is still really gross (like an unkept, unbathed trent raznor, or whatever that guy’s name is, the one from NIN).  I think devon and I went out on one more occasion, though we never did anything more than kiss (though, I found out later that he answered his roommate’s inquiries in such a fashion as to give the impression that much more had happened, without having to actually lie about it). Anyway…  Rod and I ended up hanging out with our mutual friends, Darbi  and Bryan a couple of times.  Darbi, by the way, is one of the COOLEST chicks EVER.  Actually, she is one of the COOLEST people EVER, but because there are far fewer cool chicks than there are cool men, that fact that she is so fucking cool and a chick makes her even fucking cooler.  Anyway.  Speaking of cool, I liked Rod from the first time I laid eyes on him.  He dresses in such a ridiculous fashion—black shoes, black socks, cut-off plaid pajama pants, a black t-shirt, and overshirt, a fucked up leather jacket (victim of a knife-fight) and huge, oversized, 99-cent sunglasses—that it is fucking cool again.  I hope he doesn’t think I am making fun of him when he reads this, because I am not.  I think he dresses Super-sexy.  But it took rod a little bit of time to warm-up to me.  I remember one night at darbi’s when I dragged him outside to smoke.  I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me in a very dry subtle way or if he was just messing with me, because it was obvious that I liked him (I know now that it was the latter).   Anyway, fast forward again a couple of weeks later. Saturday night: I didn’t want to be alone.  So I called bryan up, told him I was picking him up and taking him out for drinks.  I have to admit, that I was also hoping that I could get rod to come along. It was surprisingly easy to do; I walked into rod’s drink, asked him along and told him I was buying. Since rod is an alcoholic (an honest-to-god one, not one of those fake alcoholics who think it’s cool to proclaim their weakness, alcoholic buwkoski-wannabes like me), he accepted.  Rod and Bryan were on one side of the table, I was on the other.  Two drinks later when bryan got up to use the bathroom rod decided to sit next to me.  It was a loud bar ( urlLink the bad juju lounge , one of the coolest bars in seattle) he kept leaning in to talk to me.  The next thing I know, I asked him if I could kiss him and then I didn’t wait for an answer.  Bryan, of course, came back and did not look too happy to find my tongue down rod’s throat.  I suppose I can’t blame for being annoyed.  After all, two weeks earlier, there had been a similar scene with Devon.  But rod, unlike devon, is not a player, and I think bryan was a little concerned that I was just fucking around with rod’s head.  Well, bryan left shortly thereafter and Rod walked me back to his place.  I’d like to say that I was really fucking cool about the whole thing, but I wasn’t.  I was an emotional wreck and I was alternately crying about andy, and pathetically giddy because rod was actually showing an interest in me.  And I ended up nearly naked (think I kept a black thong on), in rod’s bed, making out with him and trying not to let things get too out of control.  This story is already way too long, so I will try just to summarize the rest.  That night was the beginning of the greatest and shortest love affair of my life.  No exaggeration, though of course it must seem like one, because I am only twenty-three and the affair only lasted six weeks.  But fuck whatever one else says, I was in love with rod (probably still am) and it was the most passionate, crazy six weeks of my life and I don’t imagine I will ever have an experience like that again.  I left for law school at the end of the summer.  Rod wanted to get over me, so he tried to cut off contact.   Then he slipped up and “accidentally” sent me an e-mail that he had been working on, but not really planning on sending.  He claims it was a drunken mistake, I prefer to think it was either a subconscious desire to keep me in his life or a beautifully cruel twist of fate.  Either way we started e-mailing each other.  Which evolved into me drunkenly dialing him up at 3 in the morning (his time).  Which blew up when he got fed up and called me up (drunkenly) at 3 in the morning (my time).  He spent two hours calling me a manipulative cunt, and other such sweet nothings.  I sat there and cried, but I knew what he was doing. Rod is truly honest and does not lie well.  He figured if he pissed me off enough and hurt me enough that I would never want to speak to him again and he would finally be free of me so he could get over me.  Well, it worked, but not in the way that he intended it to.  There’s no other way to put this, so forgive me if I sound cheesy and insane: I was moved by his display of emotion.  It was painfully apparent that my presence (even though I was three thousand miles away and my voice and e-mails were eerily detached from any real physical presence) was hurting him enough that he felt the only way to end the pain was to destroy any love I had for him.  His little act didn’t really destroy anything, in fact it only made me care for him more, such was the increase in affection and respect that I did my best to keep away from him.  And then… at the end one of the shittiest years of my life (my first year at law school) he “accidentally” e-mails me again.  This time it was one of his hi-lar-ious e-mails that he sends every now and then to his “favorite contacts.”  The next day I received the following e-mail:    Subject: 	Sorry          A drunken mistake.I never took the time to remove your name from my  quick list of favorite contacts.It is now removed.Fear not.It won't happen  again.Hope you're doing well.    Removed, eh?  Well.  Shit.  So what did I do?  I took it as a sign from the heavens, or at least a workable excuse, to call him up.  The conversation couldn’t have gone any better.  We laughed, we talked about music, and how shitty law school was, and random websites, I electrocuted myself (my phone started to die and I tried to unplug the mini-fridge so I could plug in the ac-adapter and I zapped myself) and we established tentative e-mail contact.  I didn’t want to push things so I wait until last week to write him.  And then, surprisingly, he sent me a wonderful e-mail.  When I read it I was laughing out-loud, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my throat because I was so giddy with emotion and then I almost started crying because I realized how much I missed him.  Consequently I have been afraid to write back.  But then today I got another e-mail (again, one of his favorite contact e-mails) and I decided that it would be safe to write.  But it was such a busy week that this is the first opportunity I have had.  And since I had been neglecting my blog, I was faced with the dilemma that opens this entry.  Rod or blog?  I realize now, that I can’t actually send this to him.   All the emotional nostalgia might force him to cut me off again. So this will have to a blog entry only.  Okay. I guess I better go and right to rod.
