Must've gained pounds living off durians, nasi kandar and air sirap for 4 days.  However, it never feels like a holiday once you have homework and all the crap that has to be completed.  Found a book heaven right on top of ChowRasta market in Penang. Didn't mind the stench nor the dusty air.  Well, the directions were confusing initially but I found it coincidently while walking back to the car.  The mamak guy, I tell you, he's the richest guy on the planet (brain-wise), ie if he ever got to read every single book he has collected for the past 12 years.  It was simply astounding to be surrounded be heaps and stacks of books that is at least 10-50 years old.  Time passed pretty quickly while I was in there rummaging for Lord of the Flies.  I knew I would never find it.  So far I've picked up about 20 books and I can only imagine if I had spent the whole day there.  And that was Monday afternoon.  Nevertheless, yesterday I had a blast at the 17 Summer Splash party with Maha all thanks to Z2.. YEAH!!!THANKS Z2! Lots of girls parading in itsy teeny bikinis and wrap-around skirts, lame contests and a handful of hot guys were spotted in the vicinity.  The theme was "Hawaiian" after all so it was all to be expected from the crowd.  Anyway, I showed up feeling like a fool and a nun in a sleeveless top and shorts but so what, I went there with a mission and I would like to think that I've achieved it.  Never guessed that the place was that happening among people my age. After having my heart beat twice as fast for half an hour, we went home feeling extremely happy and lucky and in total disbelief.  You could only guess....
