I didn't get my car yesterday... :-\  Well, I couldn't because the salesman I wanted to make the sale was off yesterday, AND my Dad had to go to the church and finish some maintenance work, so we ran out of time.  So, what's the plan now?  I will be going in this week and getting all the stuff ready.  There was some stuff I wanted added, so I'll have to pick up my car the next day.  I think we'll probably go tomorrow night after I get off work, and then I can pick up my car on Tuesday...!!!  I'm so excited!  I'm getting the Saturn  urlLink ION 2 .  It's a very cute car, and the inside is really really cool!  Once you open the link, just click on exterior if you want to see more pictures.  The trunk in this car is HUGE, too.  AND the coolest feature is that the doors of the car will not dent!  :-)  The guy showed me and my Dad.  He punched it, he kicked it... it doesn't dent.  It pops right back!    Okay, in addition to that, I went to 'O Say Can You... Swing Some More!' last night with my family.  Last year we went and saw 'O Say Can You Swing!' and it was awesome, it swept the Globe awards for last year's musicals.  Anyhow, the people in it are extremely talented, AND it's San Antonio's best kept secret.  I want to go again!  And there's this absolutely GORGEOUS guy in the show and he sings so beautifully!  I'd marry him on a whim!  hehe  Anyhow, that's all for now... I'll post more later...!
