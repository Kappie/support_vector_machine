I was actually a good rodent and washed my swatch and decently measured it and all that... I know when I get around to washing this thing it'll shrink a bit and should be the proper length but I can't help but think it'll be atrociously long.  Keep telling meself, if it comes out strange you can always fix it later... blah.   Heh, I just found out my brother has a blog here on Blogger.  While I won't flat-out give it away... okay, go to my profile and click on the town name.  Of the 6, pick the most psychotic.  That's him, unless you chose me.  Go for the second most psychotic.
