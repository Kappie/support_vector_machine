And there could not have been better timing, seeing as how I am starting my Stage Managing thing again, I will need a base to work from  Now we just need to figure out how to get it from there to here. Yet another adventure to contemplate. I might have  urlLink Brenden  help. And I am sure he is just dying to do so.  I am on lunch at work. I should probably get back to it. Tah Tah for now.
