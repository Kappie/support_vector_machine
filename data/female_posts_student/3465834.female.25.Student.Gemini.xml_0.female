Which, considering about 2 weeks ago it hurt to go the length of my hallway in my appartment buildong this isn't so bad.  On Sun I'd say honestly I ran a decent 30 min (sans fog), I don't really know if that's good or not, being as I'm not a big "runner".  What is that anyway?  Do I have to pay hundreds of dollars and get a fancy matching outfit these days to go for a run?  Do I need one of those reflecting jackets and a pair of 500.00 runners to go a couple blocks?  Well my current financial situation prohibits any of that from actually becoming a reality, so a new topic I think is advisable.  Talked to Anne today, she was a little sad due to her current financial situation, but I cheered her up by telling her a joke, that I will now share with all of you (which is still no one as I have not told anyone I am blogging but that is besides the point).  Hear about the new pirate movie?  Its rater arrrrrr!  Ha I love it!  Melissa equally enjoyed that one.  I have just been querey'd as to weather I am going to go for a cigarette any time soon by my room mate, a.k.a. code for can I take the dogs out? Hee hee!!!  I swear she likes the fact that I smoke because it means I go out late at night...  Ha!  Its cool though.  I prefer the balcony, but walking the rug rats has its advantages too, when I know what they are, I'll share them with you...  I think I'll blog more later re: the dog's party and Emma being possed by the devil himself, I've taken to calling her the spawn of satan which Melissa doesn't really appreciate but I know she's laughing inside!  Off to walk the dogs!
