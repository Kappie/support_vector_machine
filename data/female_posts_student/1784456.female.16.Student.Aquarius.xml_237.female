I think we've talked about that already. Yup! Hey so what does every one think of my links? Queer huh! Hmm I'm just looking back at old posts and getting pretty scared! Hey I'm super happy! It's like wow, I'm never super happy! I'm in a bubblegum bubble of happiness! (Ew I'm not going to clean up after it bursts!) Wow, for some weird reason I'm looking through the English dictionary, probably the same reason why I'm typing this. Oh, news flash IZZY'S ON! Wow! Did you know that pomp means a splendid display or ceremony? Did you even care? Probably not! Hey on the new weird site we should have a quiz to find out what biscuit you are! Wow! (Geez I'm bored!) Hey I wonder if geez is in the dictionary! :O! It isn't! What were thouse guys thinking! Geez! Hmm I was thinking...I should buy a domain. Hey I'm mega bored! It's either this or watching Laurence Luewela trying his hardest not to muck peoples houses up. Hmm... What am I doing?!
