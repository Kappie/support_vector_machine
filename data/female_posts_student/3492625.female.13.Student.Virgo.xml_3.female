You can breed, show, do agility/herding/tracking/etc., feed, play and everything. Remind me never to go on neo again >:]  But,(this might just be for me though)it is a  tad  bit slow.  My..uh..numberthing is  urlLink 51972  for you who want to know. Currently I have two GSD's but I do want to get a corgi^^;.  Anyway, today I made brownies. They tasted like cocoa puffs. :] Tomorrow I'm going to make Lemon Bars. Yummy. And you can't have any. Hahahaha. =P  Hahahaha! Pickles!  xD
