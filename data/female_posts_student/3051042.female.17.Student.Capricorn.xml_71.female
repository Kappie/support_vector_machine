Just another Hallmark Holiday to instill guilt upon those who don’t contact their mothers during the 24 hour period that was created to piss people off. In my personal opinion, Mother’s Day is celebrated every day. Or at least in my mind. Every time I wake up and look in the mirror, or see a relative it’s a lasting reminder of the hell this earth was subjected to when the zygote, turned fetus, properly entitled “Ashley” was brought to life. Ah… pessimism, got to love my cynical pessimism.   And my day? Half spent at Yotsuba with the list of people above, my parents, and my grandfather. Stuffed myself with sushi and miso soup. Then went to Starbucks after contemplating the fact with my parents, who wanted to go to Cold Stone Creamery… which just happens to be in Saline. I wasn’t going to Saline. And what the hell? Who was going to wait in line 30 minutes (if not more) to see people scoop your ice cream, put it on a “cold stone,” do a little song and dance, put chocolate chips or cookie dough or whatever additive you’d like into the ice cream after putting the cheesiest smile upon their face? Not I. So instead we went to Starbucks, the coffee flavored crack with a side of caffeine (as aforementioned) which was “overloaded with calories” or so my father says.   So now I’m sitting on a ottoman, staring at the crowd of people that have congregated in my living room from random places. There’s Chris (my cousin) and Ernie (his room mate) which came from the back roads of Ypsi to sit and eat “cook out buffet.” There’s Henk fresh out of Flint, probably hung over from a cocktail of homework and hard, Canadian alcohol. There’s my Aunt Henny, who drove, “All the way from Pennsylvania, and oh is her garden SO beautiful. Oh so just MUST show me the pictures on her computer of the beautiful flowers she planted.” But yet, she’s never home, she’s a fucking flight attendant. What is this world coming to? Her boyfriend, I forget his name, I’ll surely remember when I actually post this entry. He flew all the way from the Netherlands, oh boy. Barely speaks English, oh well. He makes fun of my sarcasm and takes my attitude toward life seriously… which is anything but serious. My parents, recently returned from the Arboretum, where they sweated their Starbucks, calorie inflated treats away while walking up and down hills… ridiculously obsessed with weight loss. Hmm… maybe that’s why they’re eating right now and I’m not, so they can lose weight.  Watching boxing. Excitement. Oh sorry, Kick Boxing. Mmm… I think I’ll have a salad and then go puke on the chicken (as previously planned with Michelle). I almost forgot… grilling in the pouring rain, perhaps a thunderstorm, it’s a bad idea. A really bad fucking idea.  On the brighter side of things, I get to look forward to a nice night of homework (finally time to be alone) and school tomorrow. Plans for Tuesday Testing with Michelle might fall through due to planting flowers with my mom… I will escape, I will do whatever it takes to get out of this place on Tuesday. Time for salad…
