Actually it looks awesome outside and I just thought I mention that. Things are going way better than they were this morning. I went for a walk when I got home and it was AWESOME! I went and played in Lake Ontario, well I didn't go in it, but I wandered along the shore. I yelled Hi to you Hannie, I hope you heard! Anyways, it is/was quite lovely out. I cannot wait for summer!!!
