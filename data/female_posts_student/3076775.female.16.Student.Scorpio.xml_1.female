Please refrain from dying of shock at the idea of me having clean living quarters. Besides that, today has been pretty quiet. It's cold outside today! It was warmer than this during Fall Break! Darn the weather.. Ah well, it could be worse, I suppose.  Ooh! On Saturday I'm having friends over for DDR! I can't wait! I get to see a certain someone who I haven't seen all week and who I miss very much (not sayin their name, but you know who you are!!!). Wow, I'm amazed at how very little I've got to say to the world today...can't type near as much as Chelsea, lol. Well, ttyl. Love,  Shannon "The dish is a disease!!!" --Charter Commercial
