They claim that they are different, that they do not believe in stereotypes, and will follow Avril in being themselves. So they go to Claires or some other accessory store, buy fishnet arm warmers and a fuzzy pink diary, clad with the slogan "punk rebel". Now, are these people really being themselves? Or are they just following the next trend?  Many others, not so much going after the fashion, go after the music. A year or so ago, it seemed that my generation was listening to the local Top 40 station, now, everyone has switched to the rock-alternative, is it just coincidence? And it seems like a shocking amount of people have decided the sudden urge to play guitar... why guitar? What draws people to this music with people screaming their heads off, trying to upstage a blaring guitar in the background, possibly a few drums aswell. Ok, that doesn't really have anything to do with this post, it was just on my mind.  But back to the punkers, they grab onto whatever's there, they wear they're bracelets and have their new stereotype, but they're still who they were. Why do they try so hard to be a stereotype, instead of trying to be themselves? Who we are doesn't change with which rockband is topping the charts. We now think that being ourselves is being different, but we're all in the same generation, we're going to have similarities. I have a huge problem with this, what I like is influenced by what other people like, or atleast I think it is. With some things I want to be the same as other people, with other things I want to be different from other people. Other things it'll be both, if everyone likes Sesame Street, I'll want to like it too. But most of these people like Elmo, I might love Elmo far more than any of the others (and I do), but I must be myself (different) so I'll say that I like Big Bird. But what if I don't even like Sesame Street.. or I might, I just really like Elmo just as everyone else does... Which is the bigger lie? Being the same, or being different?  Why care? We could just be ourselves, don't care what people do or don't like. But can we live like that? Uninfluenced, is that possible? That's probably why it takes people so long to find themselves, and when people do finish that quest, what do they find? When they set out, what do they expect to find?  I guess we are not really individuals, we are we. One big mass of human.
