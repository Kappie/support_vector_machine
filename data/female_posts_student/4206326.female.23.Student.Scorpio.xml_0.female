Wanted to post it so I'm pressed to continue.   Haight Street By me... duh.  The house was dark. The rain clung to my windowpanes like teardrops on broken lovers cheeks. All I could hear was the sound of flesh flapping on the linoleum, the cracks of the belt, and the pounding night. There were the muffled confused sobs after each snap that broke the otherwise paralyzed air. 	I could only tell my door snuck open because of the sudden soft waft of cold air I felt crawl across my face and sudden increase of tension in the room. I could feel her feet climbing the wooden ladder just behind my head, and I could hear the bolts and beams moan under her stress and she climbed into her bed above me. I could hear her bring her breath under control, until finally the room was still. 	I lay stiff for a while, as all frightened children do. Covers pulled tight to the chin, eye’s wide and searching, trying desperately to summon the courage to close them again. Trying desperately to understand what was going on, trying desperately to understand why it was happening. I focused on the bleeding sky outside again, and the crawling fingers of water gripping at the window.  	When the moments of silence in the room added up into a dense knot in my stomach, I rolled onto my side and closed my eyes and tried not to think anymore.  “It’s not your fault,” She whispered. 	I tried not to cry, and went to sleep.  In the morning my sister and I acted as if the nights downpour had washed away our memories like we knew we had to. She had learned long before how to dress in a way that the clothing wouldn’t bind over the welts, and how to avoid situations where she may get touched where her wounds were. I had learned that we didn’t talk about it before I learned to talk.
