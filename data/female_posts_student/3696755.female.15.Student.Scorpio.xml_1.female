Because I figure, you may like me too and not ever tell me and well both never no. What's the worst that can happen? You'll say no, and well go back to the way things were, big deal. And Im sure a lot of you are like that too. But there's always those few, the ones that just intimidate you out of your mind. That you couldn't tell them you liked them if you were paid. Because there's just something about them that you ( the not afraid of the opposite sex, very open with your feelings, give it a shot person ) are terrified of. There are 3 people like that for me. Lets meet #1. For those of you who know me and go to Franklin you'll no exactly who this is. I first saw him goin to 3rd period everyday freshmen year. He'd walk up one side of the stairs and id walk up the other, everyday id see him at the top. And since the first time I saw him till now, I can not tell him. Im sure he knows because I have no problem telling everyone else but I could not tell him for the life of me. All my friends were like what happened to you? Your Mrs. Outspoken, say what's on your mind and your afraid to talk to a guy?  Your never afraid of guys? And im still not, just him, and the other two. But there's something about him that when I see him im like shit, and I almost have to walk the other way, and I have no idea why! It bothers me. He's the worst one cause I cant stop liking him, like ill stop and then I see him and im sk rewed again. The other too aren't so bad. Lets meet #2. I've known him for a looooooong time. Our parents are good friends and we hang out when they do, u no, memorial day, 4th of July, Christmas, one of those things. But since I met him I've always in the back of my mind had this thing for him. Not this OMG I love you thing or anything but its justa cruch that wont go away. He fascinates me, he's smart, and funny, and laid back, and kinda quiet( witch is odd if u no me because I usually go out with the super out there ADD ones...). Maybe that's why I like him cause he's different, oh and maybe its cause he's really really good looking. But everytime im like hum,there's something about him. And I cant tell him, I don't no if its cause it'd be weird cause its not like a voluntarily hang out thing like we havta hang out with eachother so it'd be weird, or if it's cause im just scared, or maybe cause were friends and I dunno...? Speaking of friends that I like lets meet # 3. Ok # 3s different. He's not super super good looking like the other 2 but he's just as hott if not hotter, u no what I mean? He's....mysterious kinda and I think that's what draws me to him. He's real artistic and I dunno he's not like anyone else, he's very much his own person. Anyway, he's hands down the coolest person I no, I no that sounds stupid but really he is. He's just...everything he does, like everything I dunno its hard to explain. But were pretty close and I think that might be why I cant tell him. But see I've been closer to guys that I liked and I've told them so I dunno? I almost told him, last day of school, but I freaked out and I couldn't do it. I couldn't. So damn you people who I like and cant tell! lol I just realized, they're all kinda the same. They're all real laid back, quiet, shaggy hair kinda guys. Hum, maybe that has somthing to do with it, or maybe not who konws? But really it sucks because for all I know there having the same problem and well both never know, and that's the saddest part. What coulda been is always the saddest part.
