Hanging out with Matt makes me feel this way. I see how relaxed he is, and how social he is...and how horribly uptight and worried I am when im around people. What do I say next? they hate me don't they...they want me to say something now....i need to say something good or they'll think im so and so way... How do i stop feelings like this? I feel like my entire high school career has been a complete joke...best time of your life my ass.  to many times have i been hurt by people that its corrupted my vision of how people are supposed to be...I've told myself to "relax, just be yourself and they'll like you" But...what if this is me? A wound-up girl who freaks out all the time....untalkative and "stuck up" and anxious...In this case i must admit that i hate myself completely, and therefore can blame no one else for disliking me, or ignoring me...or not listening to me....like most people do.  I wish I could take back the years of pain so I could have a pure mind.  I'm in a foul mood right now, with the realization that i haven't had one PURE happy moment in years. literally. I'm in hell.
