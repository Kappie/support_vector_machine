There must be a benefit derived of sufficient value and meaning to you alone to be worth the effort necessary to do this and to overcome the resistance to change.   OK, let me first work on the new thought process that I want to replace the old thought process with.   When I think "this is so boring, let me do something else for a break", I need to replace that thought with "do I really hate it so much that I don't want to get a job in consulting any more? is it really so boring that I'd rather not get the phd? let's take a break after working for at least 30 minutes."  When I think "just a few more minutes" "just another article" "i'll do it tomorrow". I need to replace that thought with "This habit has caused me more trouble than anything else in my life in the past 23 years. Enough is enough. I can be stronger and better than that." or "Don't do it later -- am i really not able to do it now? I'll feel great for defeating this bad habits."  When I think "it doesn't matter, who cares if I ... (didn't do any research today) (didn't wake up at 7:30am)...", replace that thought with thoughts of the immediate feedback that I set for myself. Implement them with faith and determination. Think "it does matter. i can't allow myself to drift into being a under-achiever. eventually everybody will care if i become one."   What are the specific habits or correcting these bad habits?  - professional success: graduate earlier, better opportunities in research site, land the consulting job in Chicago that I really want - be a more responsive, reliable person - build better reputation in the academic and professional community - be more social, better care for the people around me - have more control over my behavior - feel fulfilled and happy   Step 5. Is it worth it?  Definitely. I would be extremely happy if I could go through and maintain these changes in my life!!!!!
