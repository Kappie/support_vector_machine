Last night was FUNN! me and kaje went to see I-Robot (good movie) with chris   travis holly and marissa! before we went to the movies...kaleigh ordered pizza and told them it   was for carry-out and i called like an hour later and told them that we hadnt gotten it yet..and   they thought that they made a mistake, when really kaje didnt know what carry out meant!   hahaha so we got a free pizza! :-) fUnNy fUnNy. well iDk...i believe I will write more later.
