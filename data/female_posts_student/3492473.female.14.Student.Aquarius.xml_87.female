Once again early. I didn't cry myself to sleep but it did take awhile to actually fall asleep. My mom woke me up around noonish so we could paint the other windowstill. So I changed and started painting. Usually I enjoy painting but today it was just like why the fuck am I doing this? I was doing a half ass job and my mom was like, "Wow Lauren, you're doing a great job." I got white paint all over the blue walls but I really didn't care. I just wanted it to be over with. And somehow I got the paint over my calves. Which didn't make sense because I was wearing pants and I didn't roll them up or anything. So yeah that was fun.  Not really.  Then I just sorta sat online and tried calling people. But no one was home or wouldn't answer theirs cells so I was starting to get pissed. I really needed to talk to Maura too! And pretty much everyone else that I called. So yeah, eventually Alecia called and I thought it was Julia and I was like, "This is Julia right?" And all I hear is Alecia flipping out!  Oops!  I felt bad! I love Alecia w/ all my heart! And half of hers!! LoL! So Alecia and I talked for awhile, pretty much about my "situation" and all that. God, I love talking to Alecia. She always cheers me up. So then I called Julia and that was fun in itself. I haven't talked to her in forever other than online. So we were talking about what's been going on with each other's lives and my mom's sex talk with me and strawberry flavored condoms and keeping my pants on and all that fun stuff. So then I was on the phone with Alecia again and Dave came home from work. So him and Eddie had to go wherever with the motorcycle to get new tires. Then came the fun part of the night. Getting Dave to okay me to go get ice cream and hanging out with Alex. It's funny how protective the men in my life are. Well really, my real dad isn't protective, he's trusting very trusting and open towards me b  ut we're not talking about him. I was just kinda smiling at him and he's like, "Don't tell me anything about that Alex kid coming to pick you up." Despite his IQ, he's pretty good at reading people. And I just started rambling and he's like, "Call your mother." So I'm like, "Mom's gonna be totally fine with it. You're the one I need permission from!" So eventually I talked to my mom and she just like why'd you call me for this? Dave wasn't too happy with the idea but there wasn't much he could do about it   and when Eddie found out, he looked like he was ready to have a heartattack. He started asking me a bunch of questions.   Aww, the baby sis is growing up! So I went to go get ready and Eddie left to go somewhere and Magaret came home. When Eddie got home,  all  I was wearing was boxers and a tshirt and I went to go outside and Eddie looks at me and says, "You're not wearing   that   are you?" I'm like, "Yeah Eddie...hell no!" So then I got ready and tried calling Tina but she wouldn't answer her celly. I talked to Maura so I was happy. As I was getting ready, I got this really sharp pain in my side. It was really weird. It just came out of no where and hurt like a bitch.   But I took whatever and I felt better. (happy face) So I finished getting ready and Eddie tried giving me a lecture. I do have to give him props for taking over the dad position all my life though. I didn't get bitchy about it or anything, I understood why he was saying what he was saying so I just agreed. So Alex came and picked me up and we went to Cold Stone for ice cream. While we were there, I found out  Lauren  is the  number 1 hoochie name.  I was like WTF? It's quite funny though. Oh! And congrats go out to Gretchen's Aunt Kandy on having her healthy baby girl on August 4th. 6 pounds and 11 ounces. And guess what her name is?  Lauren  Ann. Aww... Now that's gonna be a hell of a baby. OMG. Rick James died today. : /  Yes, Rick James is dead bitch.  My bro told me that some radio station was playing a voice clip of the actual Rick James saying, "I'm dead bitch." and whoever was called number X won a DVD of Dave Chapelle Uncensored. Kinda weird for a radio station to do that once someone dies, ya know? So Alex and I got ice cream and went back to his house to watch Billy Madison. It was cool. I love that movie. Adam Sandler is hilarious. Then I came home and tried calling Annie and Maura because they both told me to call them once I got home. Annie was a dumbass for that   because it was like 11:20 and her dad answered and I was like damn it and she wasn't even home. So I called her cell. Then I called Maura. She said she'd be online later but she isn't. Oh well. So I cleaned my room. *clean freak* I expected everyone to be home but Margaret was the only one home. And she was passed out on the couch. Eddie and Dave were both out and my mom was still at work so it was good to be able to "breath" ya know? So I ate and read Tom Sawyer some. It's pretty good. And the questions are so straight forward. With Lord of the Flies, the answers weren't right there, you had to "search" for them. So, yeah, everything's good. I'm happy, other than the fact that I  really  miss my dad and wanna see my McGrath family. Chris isn't coming up this weekend like I thought because his plans changed but he is gonna be up next weekend so we're gonna hang then. I'm probably gonna call Katie tomorrow, I was gonna call her tonight but it was after midnight so I didn't. She was online so I was talking to her and she said she was gonna call me once she got off but we talked online instead. Eddie was talking about how   my cousin Matt is pretty much depressed. And I feel terrible. Matt is like my bro. I tell him a lot of shit.   The boy is 16 and all he does is work. I mean he has a hell of a lot of money but that doesn't replace never seeing your friends or family. And my other cousin Tim is partying it up in Canada for awhile so yeah. Well, I'm gonna go try to write and look up some quotes. I'll post a poem tomorrow, I don't feel like looking through them right now. Night night~
