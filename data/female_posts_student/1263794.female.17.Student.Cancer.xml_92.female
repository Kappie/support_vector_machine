She was really sick, and my dad said she was suffering, so I'm glad she's not anymore, but she's been a part of this family since I was like 5. I really loved her and man am I gonna miss her. I get really attachted to my pets...I'm just happy I got to see her in the hospital. There's been a lot of death lately. Ruby, my buddy from Tae Kwon doe, my cat Patches...geeze I can't handle anymore. I try to be optimistic, but thinks just keep happening and I end up getting dragged down again. I know I say it a lot and these words get thrown around all the time, but at the moment...life sucks.
