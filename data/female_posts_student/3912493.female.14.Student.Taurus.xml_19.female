Well, last night I had a dream about band. Great.   I continued marching, and continued to suck. Out of nowhere, my dad appeared and told me we had to leave. I was worried, and I asked him, "Uh...b-but did y-you even ask Mr. Williams that I have to g-go?" Ugh, who cares what Mr. Williams thinks? It's Mr. Shine that gets the final word. But anyways, as we were walking out of the...stadium-kind-of-thing, I saw Mr. Williams. He didn't seem too happy that I was leaving, and then I suddenly found out that he was following me around. He stopped us and asked my dad if he had approved about me quitting band. What the fug? XD And that's where my dream ended. Huzzah! My mom says I look more happy and carefree. And I can't say that isn't true. Band is so stressful, and now that I'm not in it anymore, I can't be any more hyper.  But the good news is that my brother installed Adobe Photoshop 7. At last! My dream has come true! ;_; I really don't know how to use it, and it's really complicated, but hopefully I'll get the hang of it...soon. Maybe I'll read some tutorials and stuff.  The ZP members asked me if I could draw the Mod Squad. I'm currently working on that, but when you don't have a good pencil and a good eraser, it's quite tough. =_=  Still no Twelve Girls Band CD. ;_;
