I still am kind of worried about how I did on the chem test cause even though I prepared for it I found it very hard.  Maybe I did good though, I can only pray and well for once the chem teacher didn't give me an evil look.  Usually I am like scared of her cause I always feel like she doesn't like me or something but then after school she was like "Hi Vanessa" and actually had like a non-evil smile on her face.  Chels, Mike, and I all went out for lunch and we had the funniest server guy.  He came up to our table and was like talking in the REALLY FUNNY accent and well we were trying soooo hard not to laugh.  At first I thought he was faking it but then he didn't stop the accent thing but well when we got the bill he stopped doing it.  So yeah I guess he was just playing around with us but it was funny.  Then I went to chapters with them and well was suppose to go to matts but I called ash I told her I was not coming.  I don't care if they are mad at me or whatever cause ultimately what I do is my choice not theirs!  And well I just know someone is going to say something on Monday to me about "Vanessa why didn't you come to Matts" so yeah I'll be expecting it.  I am just kind of relaxing tonight.  I have lots of social stuff to do tommorow but once that is done it will all be good.  I am a little worried about the new stuff in chem though cause I don't understand it really well yet.  I think I am starting to get a hang of the math though.
