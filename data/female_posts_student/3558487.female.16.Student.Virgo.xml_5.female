During all of my sitting around, i did get to explore the polyphonic spree website ( www.thepolyphonicspree.com ) which got me SO excited for their new cd (Together We're Heavy) coming out in July. I can't wait!!   So back to what i did yesterday, since today was not that interesting... I went to the flute party which was ok but my car did get shoepolished. I dun really mind that, but i do mind it saying "Boners Rule" and "Boner Time". The "boner" was referring to tromboners, or trombones... I bet thats what all of you thought of first, too, right?? Yeah, i didn't think so. Thats also not what old men at stopsigns think of first when they are laughing at me.   I also went to a barbecue at Grapevine Springs park which was fun, minus all of the spider/ant things. It also did take a while to light the grill (like 30 minutes) but it was fun seeing and talking to friends.   Now, i am not doing anything besides updating this. Shelly told me to update it yesterday cuz its entertaining... i'm glad i can entertain you guys w/ my boring life. I'm not sure i have much more to say.   have a great night guys!
