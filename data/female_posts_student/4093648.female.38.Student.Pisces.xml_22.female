My "real" journal has been neglected for such a long time I guess everything's been sort of backing up. Thoughts, feelings, more anger than I would have suspected.  It's under control now I thought. It's all out now I thought. Guess not. No wonder I've been sitting up all night with my old friend insomnia.      Some intense cardio exercise is needed here. Too bad I don't know how to box. Running would be great but it is sooo damn hot! I'll find something. But tranquil gentle and mindful isn't gonna help me sleep. Aggressive sweaty and collapse in an exhausted pile is more like it.      This writing is helping though. Typing is good since it goes so much faster. You can get so much more out. My fingers can keep up with my brain where my pencil can't. This has got to be boring for anyone else reading it but so what? Who's this box here for anyway? Me! Hurray for me! me me me me me me me.      I can say whatever I want too. fuckyou fuckyou fuckyou fuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyou!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   And you know who you are. I hope the cunt left you something to remember her by and it makes your dick rot off. Then you'd have to find a new hobby.
