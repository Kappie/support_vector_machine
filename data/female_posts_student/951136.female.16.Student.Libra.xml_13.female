Just being there w. her. some moments mean more to you then anyone could have thought. that was one of them. Her being there fixed me in so many ways. we just talked. about stuff. life. ourselves. and the little things. trivial things. and it turned out to be a perfect night. and then i was so happy when i went home. i know this is insane to all other ppl. and no one would ever admit to doing it, but you just get in these moods. where your blissfully happy. and i just turned on the radio and danced. i dance when i'm happy. and shut up anyone whos reading htis and laughing b.c. its my fucking journal ( no alanah. i dont mind cussing)...but anyhou. i was truly happy. i havnt been that happy in a while. it was free. i m finally free of alot of things i have been carrying around all summer. and it feels good. school is about it start...sigh... i need another month of this...then again. i want to get on with my life. see where it takes me...see where i take myself better yet.  Optimism i made a badn shirt. idk. i was bored. its a fun shirt too. rebellion against chetna and her green shirts!!!! PPTTH... shut up. leave me alone in my pathetic pleasures. GOD! i am listening to the news! ALL IT IS ABOUT ARE SEXUAL ASSALTS, MURDERS, DEATHS! a guy raped a two year old guy a guy died of unsanitary silicon injections b.c. he wanted boobs. a woman was sexually assalted in her home by a stranged breaking in. WHERE IS THE WORLD GOING! to hell. thats where. BE HAPPY PPL! SMILE! TALK! DONT TAKE EVERYTHING SO SERIOUSLY, LEAST OF ALL YOURSELF!
