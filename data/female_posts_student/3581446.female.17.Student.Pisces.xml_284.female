Makes body feel wobbly and head feel trippy in the morning. MUST not forget the smokes. Drink coffee or tea every morning. I will not hit the snooze button. Snooze button is a dirty whore and wife of the devil.   Other than leaving the cigs at home (!!#%$%^$%#!!!!!), today was great! I found the 15 bus stop. Wasn't hard at all. It's right by the Seattle Art Museum...and it's in front of the Lusty Lady. ;) I did have to wait a while for the bus to come. :( That's what the cigs are for! Killing time. :( Well, I got there an hour early! :-o I think it'll be that way till the end. I'm paranoid about taking a later bus...I don't trust public transportation. You're only allowed to have 2 absences or 6 tardies (tardies=each less than 20 minutes late). That's boo boo. I will not be late-ever. I don't really like the inside of Ballard. There's one big hallway and little hallways that branch from it. I couldn't find my class at first. *sigh* BUT I did, of course, and my class rules. The teacher seems awesome. Mr. B. is what he goes by. He's looks Indian, but he's Spanish and Jewish. I thought that was pretty cool. He's so funny, though. We wasted the first 45 minutes of class on...just...blabbering. And he knew it, too. He kept looking at the clock every 5 minutes and he'd say, "Look, I've just wasted 15 minutes. Am I good or what? :D" !!!!! People are so cute. I love it. The kids in the class seem...interesting. I really want to get to know 'em and stuff, but most of them seem so...unaproachable. I hope I don't seem that way. I'm always smiling and laughing. I don't think I look mean. I look like a teacher's pet, though. @_@ I like that the classes are racially mixed. I think it's the most diverse class I've ever been in. 8-) We're starting with Philosophy. We read a book about Martin Heidegger. Cool stuff. I learned something. Glad 175 bucks didn't go down the crapper. :) I can't wait until tommorow!!!!!!! I'm such a dork.
