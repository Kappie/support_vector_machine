I am used to it though. I remember my mum shouting at me most of the times.dad too.he is actually more my mother's husband,than my father.always on her side. so i could say,i really never had a dad. no anyway,i don't think i care now.but it used to make me very sad. but you know i am thankfull to my parents though,cause their bad behavior made me able to deal with harsh and serious people. this proffessor,usually smiles at me...
