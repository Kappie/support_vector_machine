No one cares...  I need you to show the way from crazy I want to be so much more than this  With one hand high You'll show them your progress You'll take your time But no one cares  With one hand high You'll show them your progress You'll take your time But no one cares No one cares... No one cares...  No one cares... I could be so much more than this No one cares... I want to be so much more than this  No one cares... I could be so much more than this No one cares... I want to be so much more than this  No one cares... I want to be so much more than this No one cares... I want to be so much more than this  Good good bye Lovely time Good good bye Tinsel shine  Good good bye I'll be fine Good good bye Good good night  - My Sundown  Jimmy Eat World  Ever sat at home in the dark with the music pulsating, so that you can  feel  it?  Not emotionally feel it, but literally feel the sound waves hitting you, almost creating images in the ripples they cause?  Its an amazing feeling, especially when the words resonate in your mind and you hear the truth ring from them.  No one cares, and this isn't me just feeling sorry for myself, its the truth.  In reality we all care too little.  My progress has little to no effect on you and so realistically I can't expect you to care, just as I would care very little for yours.  I will rejoice with you as you reach it, but once the moment has passed I will forget it for something else.  Don't look so shocked, in reality you do the same thing.  If you think you wouldn't you are either in denial or far better a person than me.  I'm tired, truly tired.  I spent half an hour staring at a wall, not asleep just unwilling to try to make myself think.  My eyes hardly stay open anymore, my motivation gone.  Knowing that no one is counting on me and not having my own motivation things are slipping. I am no longer  accomplishing  anything and in reality I haven't been for quite some time.  My life really has no purpose at this point no drive; each day just the repetition of the day before it, the dialogue changes but the scene does not.  I need to get out there and  do  something.  I need to lay my head down at night and be able to look proudly on my day, the day during which I made progress.  Right now I'm treading water, struggling to keep one stroke ahead of sinking but not actually getting any closer to the shore.  At camp I get a maximum of 7 hours of sleep a night and work from sun up to sunset and somehow have so much energy that I can't lie still enough to sleep, thoughts racing through my mind, little smiles dotting my dreams of the wonderful things that happened during the day.  Want to know the highlight of my day today? I got laughed at by a class of 4th graders.  We (Mark, Aaron and I) were singing the hatzi kaddish, each of us singing just one word, and I tripped up on my word.  The class laughed and I started laughing and couldn't stop.  In fact that moment got kind of scary, because I lost control.  I actually had to leave the room.  Something needs to change but I don't know what.  The entire month of March is booked and my grades need remediation, so I won't be able to do anything about this for at least a month.    Don't be worried...This is just a phase...I'm not actually this depressed and unbalanced (I don't think)...Maybe some sunshine would help, can anyone arrange that?
