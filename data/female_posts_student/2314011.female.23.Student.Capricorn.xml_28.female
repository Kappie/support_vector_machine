It's been a few days since my last post, so I'll just take the days one at a time, m'kay?    Friday, December 26  The big birthday.  Yay!  Mom woke me around 9 to wish me a happy day and to tell me we had a big blizzard raging outside.  I knew when the Boy said he'd drive from Twin Falls unless a storm broke, there'd be a storm.  So we waited for the phone to ring.  After much warring, he decided to take the plunge.  The only way Mom and I could make good use of the 3 feet of snow was to go to town.  No force of nature was going to keep us from TJ Maxx, by god!  Couldn't get back up the driveway, even in the big truck, and as we left the men to dig and pull it out, the Boy called to let us know he'd made it to town, if a bit shaken up by the treacherous road behind him.  We finally got the driveway plowed, and the Boy picked up, and there was much rejoicing.  No partying was done, however, until the next night, but the obligatory candles, cake and ice cream were not overlooked.  Remember how I said The Phone Call would be happening soon?  Yea, well, it turned out to be my birthday present to myself.  Was worried she wouldn't be home and I'd have to decide whether or not to leave a message.  But she saved me from that dilemma by answering on the 4th ring.  She had bronchitis and didn't sound like herself.  It was different and the same.  Finally laughed a bit at the end, which felt good.  There will be a period of adjustment, that much is clear.  But whatever happens now, I know I'm ready for and can handle it.  Gave her the address for this blog; everybody wave.      Saturday, December 27  Regaled Mom with the high points of Crazy Aunt Karen's reply email, and she in turn regaled Levi and me with stories about the old broad.  It was decided by some unspoken agreement that he and I would not be caged in this house any longer, and we made our way into the bright, blue, white wonderland.  It was to be the only break from a string of storms continuing today, and we were not about to watch it from the living room.  Met up with Natty-poo and her world-traveling English teacher mother for a few good fondles.  Then on to dinner with the entire fam.  Yay.  Joe worked his magic one-liners on Nat as they played When a Man Loves a Woman for the 6th time.    The three of us at last descended on the only gay bar in town, for a few drinks to begin with before moving on to other scenes.  Found a drag show waiting for us, however, and ended up staying until 2.  Levi caught the eye of a cute waiter and we didn't pay for another drink the rest of the evening.  Good times.  We drank, vogued, and were forever young all night.    So yea, recovering from it all today.  Just finished X-Men 2, and might curl up with a little booky in a minute, I dunno!    Lazy days are our friends.
