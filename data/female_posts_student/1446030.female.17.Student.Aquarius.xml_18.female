I'm still suffering from 'aftershocks'... still quite sad...(QUITE onli!!honest!)...today i dun dare to tok too much or look at her much...i'm scared. i realise....dat i dun dare to face her nemore...i'm scared... perhaps separation may help me forget her...who noes? Lets see...if i wunt get to be in e same school wif her in poly or wateva...will i be able to forget her?? mayb she will becum a memory...jus like HE has....i noe i'll NEVER be able to forget HIM or HER...never will...never... Doesnt she realise it?? I care for her...n yet she hurt me...is dat e way 2 repay me? Not dat i wan her grattitude...but cant she jus be a little bit nicer to me everytime she sees me? i dun expect her to be extremely gd to me or wat....jus abit nicer...dats all i wanted... Nothing seems real to me...nothing at all....
