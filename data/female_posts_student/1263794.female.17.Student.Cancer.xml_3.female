He's up in heaven laughing at me right now. This isn't fair. Shit always happens to me. Maybe it's because I'm jewish. Shit always happens to jews. I don't think I can handle any more depression. As if school isn't bad enough by itself there's my family that I swear has gone 100% psycho and now officially all hate each other, and I'm stuck right smack in the middle of all that. PLUS as of today I think a certain someone really hates me or is just really annoyed with me which is just as bad, and this whole situation is driving me nuts not too mention depressing me to a probably dangerous state. The thing is I'm really good at hiding all these emotions so I don't think anyone knows and I'm basically by myself on this one. I do think my parents think somethings up with me. I think they think I'm on drugs which I must say I am most definitely not. I've basically stopped talking at home which I'm sure seems really weird but I just can't stand my family any more. It seems I always get in trouble when I start talking so I just don't.  I used to depend on school to cheer me up (imagine that) but lately and especially after today I have NO MOTIVATION whatsoever for going. Why do I have to be so damn obsessive over things. I have a MONOMANIA and I hate it. It's probably obvious what I'm talking about now, and if this was a real diary I would be much more specific but I do remember this is public. And here I am yapping to a blog where I probably should be talking to someone.  O well this is safer. There is one thing I keep telling myself, it seems things have hit an all-time low so there's nowhere to go but up.  Something good has to happen to you Sharon. PLEASE. I think I deserve something good. My day has to come eventually and I am READY. Who knows maybe tomorrow will be awesome. I highly doubt it but maybe.
