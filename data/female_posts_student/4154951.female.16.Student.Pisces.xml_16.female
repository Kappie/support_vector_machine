I'd like to sing this for that talent thingo, but the audience would be asleep by the third note... >oP My Love is such a sweet song.. Paul and Linda wrote it together, y'know.. *sigh*      I really should get started on my S assignment.. *procrastinates too much* I really need a Krispy Kreme donut right now... or some chocolate.. Too bad I ate everything sweet in the bloody kitchen, now there's nothing but savoury stuff. Nyyeeeehh.      Woohoo- I just won Solitaire...again. For the third time. Aww I wish I had a dog, so we could be best buds >oP      I got up at 3:30 this morning to watch the Opening Ceremony..I fell asleep 20 minutes in.. What the hell was that?! Snoozefest 2004?       And when I go away, I know my heart can stay with my love.. It's in the hands of my love, and my love does it good.....         Do you think Last Dance by Donna Summer is appropriate to sing at talent quest?          Last dance..last chance for love..yes it's my last chance for romance tonight.. I need you by me, beside me, to guide me, to hold me, to scold me, coz when I'm bad I'm so so bad..       Sounds more like a wedding song, right? Dang... How about Heaven? Not the shitty Bryan Adams or DJ Sammy version, Nina's one..       Never been any good at love, never could find no one that I dreamed of..Must've been too blind to see you were always there waiting for me.. Then the spell was broken, my eyes opened, started believing in love again..Just when I gave up on miracles, you rescued me and showed me the way....       Sounds good to me. >oP OMG, my dreams are sooo stupid. Last night, in my dream, I ordered a chocolate pizza. Seriously. I  did ! My dreams are so unbitchin' ATM.. I'm gonna go scramble some eggs.    There are only two certainties in life: death and sunglasses. -Paul McCarthy as 'CSI: Miami's Horatio', Comedy Inc.
