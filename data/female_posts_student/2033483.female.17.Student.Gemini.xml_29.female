I still really hate where I sit in Algebra!  Can you say new seating arrangement? 2. Physics is...Well...ya know math in the form of science.   3. vocab quiz yay!  I hate those things b/c like Jason said when are you ever gonna say those words? 4. Took my chemistry test in the learning center so I could go to Renaissance 5th period.  I also ran the paper with Teddy.  And I will now get good karma like Nikki would say and say something nice.  Teddy was really nice to me today.  I find it very humorous that ppl think I was in Acc English 1 and 2.  Sorry ppls I was in the regular class.  But she said I had a high vocabulary but as I reflect on mine,  I really don't think so.  I also found it odd that we both argeed that Nikki was a drama queen.  Teddy is Nikki's best friend and even she said it.   5. Renaissance was good.  I like pizza, but then again who doesn't?  Mrs. Hanson let Renae and I go back to her study hall since we had already done the things in our classes that needed to be done.  That was fun! I wish I could ditch Chemistry everyday and go to ULE.  Their are no fun kids in ULE 4th period.  Although if I for some reason went to ULE 4th period I would not see Hot Boy that's not so Hot Boy anymore b/c he got a hair cut.  I hope it grows back real quick like.  Lexi does not need to know his name nor does anyone else.  Especially AJ b/c then she'd tell him.   6. The essay test for history.  OMG!  Thank God my hand is still attached.  7. Newspapery stuff.  I said it once and I'll say it again. Joe Beck is a really nice kid,  This is why he's friends with everybody b/c he's a nice kid.  He commented on my AP History book (Which alot of ppl have and I don't know why), but then we started talking about it and how he didn't take the AP test but still got an A in the class.  I wish I had an A in that class.  I mean you fail one test and your wonderful grade goes done the crapper.    oh and Ross-What the hell?
