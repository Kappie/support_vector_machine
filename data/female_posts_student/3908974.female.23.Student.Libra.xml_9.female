Since I found out I'm sticking around in Kansas, I've been as irresponsible as I can possibly be without losing my job or getting bad grades.  Which basically means that I've been on a bender since Spring Break.  I feel as if the break itself is still going, except for the eight hour distraction of school and a job.  I have barely slept recently, and the upshot of that is that my subconscious mind is sneaking up into my waking hours, turning the world into some kind of hazy circus that makes no sense.  I feel like I'm disconnected from myself, like my eyes are windows and I'm looking out.  The problem of the Big Crush has subsided somewhat now that he and I have established a mutual interest in each other.  It seems like there's always a period when emotions are running so high, when everything seems to be at stake.  It's the most exciting thing, starting out and being so uncertain.  It's the thrill of the possibility of being shot down, then the awe and relief of being embraced instead.  But it's so hard after a while, and when it finally starts to come into focus, it's never too early.  Not like I have much experience.  Just one, but that was enough.  I am not sure about him, not yet.  But I like him like crazy and I'm just trying to roll with it.  We're so different that we can't help ourselves.  My roommate, bless her, has undergone a complete turnaround.  I was about to just go become a nun because I didn't want to be the kind of girl who pisses on her friends for the sake of a man.  But she's been very supportive lately, and we're still tight.  That makes me feel better than anything.  I want to write more, but I have to work--
