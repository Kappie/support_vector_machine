When Willard is staying in Kurtz's "temple" he makes the observation that this manappears to be more anxious that him for the killing and he seems to be asking for that favor that will give him peace; this shows us that he might not agree with this man's way of thinking but he does see him as a very troubled human being and that he understands him.   When it comes to me judging Kurtz, I guess I automatically do judge him, because Ido not findbeheadings and sacrifices pleasant orjustified, but when I think about it I really can not judge him, because he is in an environment that strips his mind of all prejudices, ethics, and rules, except for the necessity to survive in a world where survival of the fittest is the only law. Kurtz acts like a god in front of this natives and does what he think is right, and, in the end, it is right because he is surviving where most men perish. I think Marlow is extremely right when he says that we can not understand his situation from where we are, so the only way to realize that we can not judge Kurtz is by putting ourselves in his place and forgetting all that has been taught to us in the civilized world.
