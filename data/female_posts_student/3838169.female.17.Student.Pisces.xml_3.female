(woohoo)  which, instead of wisely handing it over to my father to cover my lapse in care insurance, or rushing it directly to my savings account, i have decided that I will spend the ENTIRE thing on....(take a guess...)...MYSELF!!!!  Baha!  i plan to buy paint for my bedroom (it will most likely sit in the garage for a few months, until my mom or dad become so agrivated by my laziness...they will paint my room for me...or...i might find alien-like energy within myself, so that i actually complete a project in the next 3 days)------i also plan to buy a shit load of clothes for myself.  maybe go tanning.  buy me some cigs.  ah....opportunity is endless.  currently, though, i'm just sitting on my arse, dreaming of all the fun things i am about to accomplish/waste money on.  my mom needs to call me from work so i can get my ss card...........for my bogus work permit...aha, i found it in an old purse...now i must go, little brother accompanying me and is a wee bit impatient.... matsen
