Henry just told me on Friday that the reason I hadn't seen a pay increase on my checks yet was because he was waiting out on it.  Since he held out, I'll get two pay increases at once.  So, I'll have one for a promotion, and another for holding the position of site manager for 30 days.  WOOHOO!  My next paycheck should be a nice one... which is good, because then I'll have some good financial standing going into summer... I'll have a bit more money to throw around (even after car payments)!!!  :-)  Speaking of throwing money around... I had said something to Melissa about going to Schlitterbahn on Friday (since I don't have work).  So, we'll see... she'll be in town, and has a season pass.  I've decided to get one, too.  I mean, the way that training sessions worked out this summer at Urban Ministries... we'll have about 2 weeks of training, and then 2 weeks off.  This worked out perfectly for our summer vacay plans...!  My family and I are going to Port Aransas for a solid week.  Awesome!  It should be lots of fun because Rob and Kathy will come for a weekend!  :-)  Speaking of those two, they're coming next weekend to visit.  Their house is coming along quickly, too!  In one week time, the house went from a foundation, to entire structure!  They actually passed it up because they didn't think it was their house!  They just went by yesterday, and saw the dry wall panels stacked inside... so they'll be finishing off the interior walls soon, as well.  They're actually sorta hoping it takes a bit longer because they still have their apartment til Sept. I believe.  So, they'll be between the two places during mid-August to Sept.  I've told them that my gift to them will be to paint a room or two in their new home.  I'll provide the money, they pick the paint and the room... and I'll do it.  I know that I can get it done in 2 days... and it'll be a nice housewarming gift for them.  I've been sick... *sigh*  I really was afraid that I had strep throat, because a couple of our kiddos were out (sisters) last week because their mom had strep.  When I started having a sore throat on Thursday, I got a bit scared.  It went away some by Friday morning, so I didn't go see the doctor about it, thinking it was just allergies.  Well, then by Friday after work, I was feeling awful again... and so I told my Mom I would have to go to a clinic and get it checked out, because I knew I'd have to be on an antibiotic for at least a day before I could expose myself to kids.  If I waited til Monday, then I would've had to be absent from work.  So... we checked with our insurance PPO listing, and saw that I could go to TX Med Clinic and co-pay $15.  So, yesterday I went... I was in and out of there in about an hour... I'm pretty sure this is because I was covered on insurance, and they knew they'd have no trouble getting paid, and because it wouldn't take them long to check on my complaint of a sore throat.  Turns out that I was negative for Strep A (the serious one that is tested for)... the doctor offered up the idea that I had a sub category of strep (B, C, or D) or maybe a virus.  At any rate, he wrote me a prescription for amoxicillin and a pain killer.  I went and dropped off the prescription at Walgreens and went home.  My parents picked up the meds, and so I took my first pills yesterday... already today I feel 100% better!  It no longer hurts to swallow... only thing is that I'm a bit dizzy because of the pain killer I was prescribed.  I guess Darvocet does that to ya, being that it's an opiotic drug.  Hehehe... I'm high.  ;)  Other than that, I'm great!  :-)  That's all for now... comment on my highness... it's quite fun...!  I'd even go as far as saying it's better than being tipsy!  :-P
