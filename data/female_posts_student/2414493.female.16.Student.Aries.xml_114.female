I ask who she's on the phone with. It's ED of photography. I've heard her on the phone twice with him now. What the hell is this? They both like opera. That scares me.  Maybe it's simply hypersensitivity that allows me to detect all these little things. Or maybe it's intuition. Whatever it is, I smell a rat. But he has an Asian wife too. I didn't go to lunch on Sunday for obvious reasons, but they came over first. I heard Mandarin being spoken, and I look out on to the entryway. That calmed my suspicions a bit, but there's really no logic to it.  I hate this.   Jess and I saw Doupe today. In conversation, one of his friends stopped by and started hissing Savage Garden while orbiting a very frightened Jess. How can people respect themselves like that? But Jess brought up a relevant point today. Maybe I can trade in Dad's car for a Prius or something less expensive so I don't have to suffer so much paying for gas. I'm looking up the value of Dad's car right after this.  Thought I was going to leave school at 11:30 today, but for some reason they changed it so that we all had to stay on campus for lunch without telling us beforehand. I wish I could drive.  I don't understand why Grandma's birthday party is such a big deal, seriously. They expected me to play violin, but that's the day after three SATIIs and a piano competition, and also the day before my first AP. Then Ed's coming, which is disgusting. And then they keep on asking me what I'm going to wear. I'm not wearing anything fancy, I tell you. Maybe it's a reaction, but I don't see the point of dressing up in sequins. Grandma's just too into it. Sure, she's turning 80, but I don't believe in this age thing anyways: birthdays are simply a milestone, growth is gradual. I've already wrapped all 40-some of her presents for her. I'm actually going when I could probably be enjoying an English study session. Mom doesn't bother to ask about the rest of my weekend first: the primary concern is what I'm wearing Sunday night. I can't believe her audacity. What priorities!
