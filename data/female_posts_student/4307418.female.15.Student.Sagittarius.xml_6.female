Pleassse For that matter, TDD is coming up, and can someone please volunteer a digital video cam, so that we can record our "swansong" and post it here maybe, so that the whole world can marvel (or laugh or otherwise) at our antics. Hello Oh yes, and a good way to stay awake to study is to study outside. It wouldn't do to fall asleep at a coffeeshop would it :P
