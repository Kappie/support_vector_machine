Though she's not registered to vote yet, That's what she'd be. That's what she'd be. Or maybe an independant.  DANG! That girl's pretty sweet and it's quite the treat To know her. To know her. She's a spiffy sort.  CANADIA! Doesn't have much to do with her But she loves it so. Oh oh oh She loves it so. Hey yeah woo woo! She loves it so.  She's got brains in her head Which work fairly well. Though due to a rare birth defect she has only two legs.  ELM! She's pretty insane But we loves her. We loves her. We done loves her good.  Yeah, the Canadia part begins the bridge, which ends with the line about her missing legs.  I just love how no one will understand the least of this save her and VW.  For the rest of you, just bear in mind that some of this is inside jokes, but most of it is random insanity.
