It's about a 5x5 foot circular blow-up pool and its about a foot and a half deep. It's blue with little fishies all over the bottom. Too cute. Gage just thinks it's the best thing in the world too. Kristina is currently pregnant with her second child. She's due in late August. Another boy. Her and Jon have been married for a couple years now, I think, and they want to have a big family. She's my age- 23. She keeps asking me when Jeff and I are going to get married and start having kids. Lol. Not any time soon I can tell you that. I put up with 3 dogs right now and I can assure you- thats enough! I know that eventually I do want to get married and settled down, but I feel so young still. I don't want to do all that until I'm like 28. Maybe to some that's a long time away, but not to me. Plus I can see what everyone else has to go through so that by the time I get to that stage in my life, I'll have had a lot of experience. I was asking what Kristina and Jon wanted to name their baby and they have some awful (I pray she never reads this) names. See Jon wants his kids to have names that no one else has b/c his name is Jon and their are  tons  of Jons everywhere. So they have come up with Briar, Gunner, and Tuff. Terrible. Briar reminds me of that Disney thing- Briar Fox- or something, and Gunner is something I would name a hunting dog, and Tuff- well that's just silly. Everyone will say Tuff ain't so Tough is he? (Or something equally as dumb) But how do you tell someone that the names they're thinking about are...well....wierd. I'm all about originality, but I think you should carefully go over what terrible things could be associated with their names. Bullies can be mean. Did you hear *read* what Gywneth Paltrow named their new baby girl?!? APPLE. C'mon! Are the next ones going to be Peach and Pear? Maybe apple holds some kind of romantic meaning to them or whatever, but if that's the case then I think you should save something like that for the  middle  name. Anyways.....  My friend Megan recently moved up to Syracuse, NY with her boyfriend and Memorial Day was her b-day but I have no address or telephone number to get in touch with her, so I didn't get to tell her Happy Birthday. Maybe I could call her parents. I'm sure they know a number I could reach.  Today I am   finally   going to go to the beach. My sister and some of her friends are going to Blue Springs and asked me to come, but I really want to go to the beach. I need a new beach pass anyhow. Plus I like to go to New Smyrna Beach and look at some of the surf shops they have. Well, nothing else exciting to write about at the moment. I'm going to get my bathing suit on and head out. Have a great day!!
