Although i felt like i was being hit on by every guy there that was my age, but thats ok.  There are alot of creepy guys there, but the guys that jessi hangs out with are cool.  I got to hang out with Robbie(Jessi's boyfriend) and really talk with him and then i met his best friend, Peter, who is one cool kid. There was this one kid named Ryan who was kinda.....imposing in a sense.  He got annoying after awhile.  There was this really hott blonde guy that Robbie brought with him but he had to leave to attend to his girlfriend :/ its cool though, whatever, he was still hott.    Sunday: i hung out and did the mothers day thing.  it was alright, but my family gets annoying after 10 consecutive hours of having to hang out with them....thank god there was a hockey game on and i had an excuse not to hang out with them for 3 hours.  lalala time for school!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
