I was like, "NO!" he was like, "Oh, GOD, dont tell me that you're a freaky-deaky liberal or something..." and I was like, "I'm pretty far left, dude." and he was like, "Oh noooo!" and I was like, "Oh noooo!"  It was a fright fest.  Laughable, but scary nonetheless.  Then I pointed out that he cant be THAT conservative if he rocks out to Bruce Springsteen in his office when he thinks no one is listening.  Mmmhmm!  (shaking head in shame)  Maybe I can turn him around... we'll see.
