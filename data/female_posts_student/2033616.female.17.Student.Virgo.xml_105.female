Or what I like to call, throw the entire contents of your bedroom out of the room and start over.  It shouldn't have taken this long, and I'm still not done, but I have a way of getting side-tracked.  I have $43 in small change and now a really cool collage of Italy on my glass top desk.  BUT!  It is going to look so much fun when I'm done.  It'll be like new, without really changing much.  In any case, I like to clean, reorganize, and figure out ways to make things neater or more efficient ect. Wow... Do I sound like a housewife in training or what?  I went to Laura and Kyle and Jenny's DAPA concert tonight.  I got to see JOSH DEWIT.  That kid is just adorable.  I went to the concert with Kayli and afterward we went out to dairy queen with Laura and Kyle and Andrew Pa.  It was a crazy fun time it was.  Then I took Kayli home and it was only 10 o'clock and so I went to Barnes and Noble and picked up two books.  One is a daily devotional called "Reflections for Ragamuffins" and the other is called "When God writes your love story."  They both look very interesting.    I have a lot of plans for this summer, and that's not just my calendar plans.  But since you mentioned it here they are.  Next week I am having a get-together as my goodbye to Chad, Mateja, and Neubie.  I love entertaining and even getting ready for the party (back to the house wife thing).  On June 5th I leave for Rapid City to counsel a Middle School camp at Camp Rimrock.  I've only attended camp there once, but I'm gonna be Nikki's counselor so it's sure to be fun.  The day after I get back, I take the ACT in the morning then book it over to the church and leave for the Chicago mission trip.  We get back and the next day I start KinderKamp at McKennen park.  aawww those three year olds are just the cutest!  Then the next week.. I'm FREE for the whole week.  And then on the 4th of July I go BACK to the Hills to be a camper at Rimrock.  Then I come home and then two days later I leave for Okoboji to counsel for the Music Art and Worship camp.  This time, it's elementary kids.  Then I come home, grab Jamie, and go back to Okoboji to counsel for MORE elementary kids.  Then, the following week, it's one more week of KinderKamp, this time at Kuehn Park.  And then it's August and I sleep for a month before school starts again...   But, those aren't the plans I was talking about.  Part of it has to do with my devotional.  I really need to set aside some quiet time everyday.  This summer is my summer to redefine myself.
