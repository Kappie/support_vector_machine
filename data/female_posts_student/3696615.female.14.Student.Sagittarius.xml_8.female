Soon the grass will all be a disgusting gray color thanks to Bush's fantastic laws that allow pollution. Wahoo. Often times I wonder if George Bush is actually a human being, or just a gorilla wearing an ugly human mask. Much of what he says, I feel, never really makes sense. Hell, anyone who can corrrectly speak English should feel that way too.I'm not sure how he ever became president. Oh, wait, thats right, he cheated ;-). And all the republicans seem fine with that. Mostly because theyve never really cared how they became successful, just so long as they became "successful".  And you know, I'm really not ok with George Bush, a middle aged balding republican man who will never get pregnant, never have the risk of getting pregnant, never understanding what its like to be pregnant, to try to make/take away laws that steal the rights given to pregnant women.   Incase you haven't noticed, I'm pro-choice. But you know, this doesn't mean I'm saying "kill all the fetuses". It means that I support a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with her body. If she is in a terrible position in her life, if she cannot bring a child into this world, if she became pregnant due to rape, or by accident (meaning there was protection, but it didnt work 100%), etc... she should always have the right to choose what she wants to do with her body.   I once saw a car decorated with pro-choice bumper stickers. The one I loved the most was "keep your laws off my body."   John Kerry... ahhh, John Kerry. I love him to death actually. Probably the only politician that I want to give a big ol' hug. You know, that commercial pissed me off. The one that complained that John Kerry voted against the Laci Peterson law which "protects pregnant women from abuse." The reason John Kerry voted against it, was because there was also something addressing the issue of abortion he didn't agree with, which probaby meant it was pro-life, rather than pro-choice. Since Kerry is for a woman's right to choose, then of course he voted against it. You can't toss all this shit into one law. If the Laci Peterson law didn't include anything relating to abortion, then I'm pretty sure he would have voted for it. Sheesh.   Republicans claim that Kerry is too liberal. No. He just changes his opinions. Everyone opinions always change, and for them to point out just one person and call them liberal, is both ignorant and makes republicans seem mentally handicapped. Oh shit, wait, I forgot. They REALLY are.   Anyway, thats enough for now... I didnt bother proof-reading this because I'm going to the beach soon.
