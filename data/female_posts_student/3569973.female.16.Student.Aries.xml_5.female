Its like as soon as I got to work I had to learn about 30 different things right on the spot. I got home and went straight to the phone to call Jake, but only to remember than me and him had been arguing before I left for work. So the whole night (well up until about 12) we argued a little then ended up telling each other all that icky stuff that little kids call love. I missed him so much. Then this morning I woke up and I was ready to get up its just that my body didnt feel like moving. But I did it anyways...took a look in the mirror and almost wanted to throw up at the sight of myself, I gotta start running more. Well Im sure Ill have something to write about later. Considering Im sure there will have to be something that I need to write down after going to the snowcone stand and bible study. Until then, later days.
