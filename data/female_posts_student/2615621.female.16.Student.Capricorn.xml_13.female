And i'm still not caught up. I have to finish my world map test. I was talkin to lornes friend tommy a few mins ago and he said lorne was talkin about me while they were working on his car. I wish i could just be a fly on the wall and hear everything he says. I still cant wait until saturday nite. I hope he can come over. Kristen doesnt like joe, but i invited joe over to be with kristen...i really wish that lorne could just come over and be with me, but it might feel a lil weird, we've never been alone. It doesnt make any sense. He's planning on asking me out saturday and we've known each other for not too long, what a huge leap..going from hanging out 2 times to being a couple...hmm..oh well, i'm not gonna stop it. I talked to ashley g. tonite and she told me she liked this guy named jordan and how he was in her art class..it was jordan childress, as in my old jordan. lol I was like yay!! cuz jordan needs a good catholic girl in his life (rolling of the eyes but only for his betterment - is that even a word??) Comes to find out jordan had his eyes on ashley too. They both know the other likes the other and yea..lol YAY me. More hookups..but of all the people in the world, the one person i want to see find someone she truly likes and gets along with is Lauren (yeah u). I mean, honestly, there's nothing wrong with her. Shes beautiful and is a great all around person. It almost makes me want to wish i could have met lorne after she met someone. idk why really... but things happen in their own time. Blind dates do wonders!! I'll have to take her with me and lorne and a friend of his sometime!! haha yeah, but only after i see his friend and he passes my approvement, i just really wish will would get his stupid ass act together, cuz i know he likes lauren- hes told me. maybe he feels nothing is really happening..who knows. but oh well, lauren- step out there and get him--i believe in ya.
