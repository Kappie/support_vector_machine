I thought Christmas was a time 4 family and umm what are they called oh yeah FRIENDS!! *cough cough* (sorry Kes 4 stealing it just felt it was appropraite)  So I have been inside all day.  My mum and sis have colds, I have nothing to do, and its only the first day of the holidays, o joyus rapture.  Umm i think i may be ill, as the page seems to be moving and blurring a bit.  I better have a lie down.  Blow that its gone back to normal now.  Ummmm i have rainbow coloured nails, it looks mighty fine if i do say so myself.  Ok then i think i will be going now.  I may not get back on the computer untill after christmas day so; Have a fantastic day and dont a) eat 2 much b) drink 2 much or c) get up after 7:30am!!! Toodles xx
