Her words was so strong that it brought back bad memories to my head and it hurt. Her boyfriend comes home with different girls every weekend. His broke ass doesnt even work and dont do shit around the house. He'll take her money, her credit cards,  pond her jewelry. Anything for money. Throw his anger and abused her for everytime she try to defense herself. She's hopeless, cant expose her thoughts, cant go out, cant talk on the phone when his around, cant do this, cant do that. Her face was drown with tears. A tissue was handed to her and she evenually drenched it. She ran to me for a hug and asked for help. I was devastated as my heart begins to iches with emotional feelings. I was disgrace of his behavior.  All I can say to you my friend is to stay focus and be strong, leave him because his a nobody, his a loser, his got nothing to offer. You have no future being with him. He'll never bring you happiness. What he does now will continue on for the rest of your life. Dont expect him to change because he never will. Dont fall for his sweet talks because its all lies. Your a smart girl. You've got a year left to graduate from Davis. Just leave him, you've got your parents and friends to support you. Dont be afaird to lose him because there are others out there. That Mr. Right will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience and be honest to yourself.  God will evenually punish him for what his done to you. Once that day comes you have the right to either laugh at his ass or feel sorry for him. Its up to you to decided. I might be wrong and you might not believed in my words. But what ever you choose to do I'm always here for you.   I hope that my advise will open her eyes and lead her to a new step in life. It isnt all that great but thats the best I can do.  Oh my god, headaches dammit. Let me put out some anger by playing tennis. Vivian, here I come, I'm gonna kick your ass, prepared to lose LOL.
