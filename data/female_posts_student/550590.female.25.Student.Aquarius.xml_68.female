Speaking of Gardens I should get some plants that aren't dead.  That would be nice.  I almost bought some today but then I realized that groceries would probably be a better investment.  So answer me this all you men in my life.  Funny this blog is read almost entirely by men and yet none of you are dating me...huff... Anyway so the question I'm posing to all you testosterone reaking friends of mine is this: When did I go from do-able but not date-able to marriage-material but not date-able?  And how does one get oneself out of this situation?  And how do I become date-able?  Sheesh.    Now normally the questions I blog are mildly rhetorical (although I can't believe NONE of you jumped on that Drain the Lizard comment yesterday...talk about disappointing) but this one I'm actually looking for answers on this one...preferably funny ones...or hope-instilling ones...You can also feel free to embellish on your compliments.  It would just disappoint me so much to leave Gainesville without ever having a meaningful relationship that lasted more than a couple weeks.
