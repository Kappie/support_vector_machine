Everyone on FameTracker is talking about how LJ is more personal and a Blog is just random thoughts. I also started to set up an account at DiaryLand.com but have yet to recieve the password they were supposed to send me. i was just looking at a site called GreatestJournal.com and that seems alright. Blogger just seems so much easier right now. Apparently, you don't make friends on blogger like you do on Live Journal.
