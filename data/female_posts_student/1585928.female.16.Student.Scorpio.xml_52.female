I do NOT know what his problem is, I haven't talked to him since Saturday night and thats only because I called his sorry ass!... but me and Julie have made an agreement that I can't call or talk to him, until he calls me! and there is a consiquence If I do call him! but I do not want to have to suffer through it, so there is no chance in hell I'll be callin Cary Trammell anytime soon!, lol! (I can't say what the consequence is!)... but anyways... I understand people have crap they are going through, but that doesn't mena he has to take it out on me! and I found out some very disturbing news about him and the things he does that I really wish wasn't true, but I know they are and can't change them so, i guess this is for the best! I don't know, but its sooo weird how someone can tell you everything you wanna hear and you actually think they TRULY mean it and then turn around and all hell breaks loose!.... fuck it!... I'm not gonna even waste my time on it anymore, because I know he's not goin too!! *I'm so frusterated*-I'm out- *bRiTtAnY*
