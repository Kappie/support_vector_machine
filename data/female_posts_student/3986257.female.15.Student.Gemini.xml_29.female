"you drink soda weird" "thats not how you're supposed to use your spoon/fork/knife" "nothing at all really goes on inside your head" "you use the toothpaste wrong"  and on and on. and its with things i say, too. i try and make a joke, shes all "that wasn't funny" or "that didnt make sense" or something like that. she gets that part from mom - mom doesnt laugh a lot. i showed her the bday card i was going to give sg and she read it andgave me a tight-lipped half-smile. when i read the card myself i burst out giggling. people these days. sheesh.  and then half the time tasha acts like a 3 year old and the other half she tries to be cool and be in charge of everybody.  last night, she was all, "mommy....daddy....i dont wanna go to work on monday..." in this sappy childish voice. shes 19. give me a break.  "im tired..." "i dont wanna go to grandmas house, i have a headache..."  she always has a headache. she gets migraines (rarely) but in her life she has a headache every day. im startign to wonder if they're fake or not.  and then she is just plain bossy.  she doesnt act like this towards her friends, at least i dont think. just her family. and i dont think its grandpa dying that stressed me out, actually i was pretty okay with it. i think its her. i've tried talking to dad about it, trying to convince him she needs to be on something like zoloft or welbutrin, but he just jokes about how she always "lets off steam" or has "perpetual PMS."  i cant wait until the beginning of school just b/c thats when shes leaving.  i mean, part of e will miss her, but most of me is wanting to pull her hair, break her glasses, and give her a good punch to set her crooked nose straight.
