Even with the constant rain and such.  I'm getting my belly button pierced tomorrow. And...I know what I want for my tattoo. But it's a surrrprrriiiseeee. :)  Given that my dad doesn't back down on his word.  But the piercing is definite.  So to sum up things: Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. :-P Haha. Okay. Right.  La la la nothing else to say really.  Catch you foolish crazies later.
