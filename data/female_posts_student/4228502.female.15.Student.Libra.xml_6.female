And it didn't help that I had to go to MasterDrive. (A drivers Education program) There are three phases and I am so happy I'm on phase three. But I still have four more drives with the intructors. Today I had to do backing and parking. For two hours. To start off that can't be so much fun, and it wasn't. At all. It was so hot in the backseat for the hour I was back there. Then after I was done my mother was fifteen minutes late picking me up; that is a long time to wait outside of the little outlet building in the hot sun.       The rest of the day wasn't so bad I guess, but I was sad because my friend's computer wouldn't let him play Age of Mythology. So we couldn't play eachother online. I'd been looking forward to it so I was rather depressed when it wouldn't work. The last two times we tryed to play someone couldn't make it because some last minute thing came up...annoying. But I was still not very upset..though now thinking about it I guess I kinda was cause I got really mad later on and that doesn't usually happen.      We went out to dinner. To 'celebrate' going back to school. It was a nice dinner and I had fun. Besides the food was really good. hehe. I only got mad after we got home. My mother is obsessed with treating acne...and no I don't have acne. So she bought this new stuff, I told her I wasn't going to use it because I didn't want to. But eventually being the good little child I am I used the frickin' face wash. A few minutes later my sister tells my mother I didn't use the toner and face lotion.       Before I continue I should explain that I hate how face lotion feels. It is disgusting and slimey and just all around icky. So I don't use it, and my face isn't dry.       So my sister comes back with a message from my mother saying that I must use the toner and the lotion for it to work and I didn't give a darn what it said. I wasn't going to use the toner or the face lotion so she could go shove it up her. Not that I said that...just thats what I was thinking. So she sends my dad in to tell me to use it and hes all in the hushed tones...being all its not my fault don't yell at me..and I wanted to rip his frickin' head off! So he starts talking and that pissed me off more than using the junk. So I grabbed it from him and slammed the bathroom door to use it. He found that funny and that just made me more frickin' pissed then I already was.       I mean wouldn't you be pissed if you had slimey, smelly gunk all over your face? Even if you do normally moisterize. For all you prissy female dogs, shut the heck up!!! I'm not 'unclean' I don't have 'improper hygeine'. I CLEANSE! I WASH! I PUT LOTION EVERYWHERE ELSE! I POLISH MY NAILS AND I REALLY DON'T CARE IF I HAVE ONE FRICKIN' ZIT!!!!!!!!!!!! So you can either all go do yourselves or you can have sympathy. Sympathy being the better choice of the two.      But then he had the nerve to ASK if I ACTUALLY used the junk. YES I FRICKIN' USED IT! WOULD I BE ALL RED AND FRICKIN' PISSED AT YOU RIGHT NOW IF I HADN'T!?!??!?!?!?!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I FING WOULDN'T!!!!!!!!!!      I huffed and I cried and I yelled and I shunned my mother. But somehow I ended up promising my father I'd use the junk for two more days; so my mother 'hadn't wasted her money'. But really even if I never touched it, my sister would be using it so it wouldn't be a waste now would it? NO I REALLY DON"T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!       You know normally I'm all sweet and caring and I care a lot you know? I love people. I love to make everyone feel better about whatever is wrong, or I like to think that I actually manage to help. But anyway sometimes I just get really really mad, and I'm not even sure why. It wasn't that big of a deal to just use the shit. And now I have a headache and my stomach hurts...so I am paying the price. Darn it all. But anyway..I guess I'm done rambling on..mostly because my head hurts too much to think out what I'm saying anymore.      You all go off and die.
