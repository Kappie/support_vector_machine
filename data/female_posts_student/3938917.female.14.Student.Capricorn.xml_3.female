Then I went to my dad's house which isn't important, but that was basically my day. Then, today, me and Damian went to Brock's house for band practice and then to Ty's at around 7. Not really much to say about it, except it's been fun!! I like days like these. Tomorrow is Friday and Damian has to go back to work, so I'm going to have to find something to do...which could be hard, because there's not a whole lot around here. Oh well, I'll manage (hopefully). Well,this was quite a short post for such good days, but I don't have anything else to put, so I'm flyin! Laterz
