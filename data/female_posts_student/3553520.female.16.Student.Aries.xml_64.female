What a good time.  Came home to an empty house. It was a *w*e*e* bit sad.  I take that back. It was very sad.  I was so pumped in the car to see my family   That I almost .p.i.s.s.e.d. myself.  [sigh-age] So sad. Sad indeed.  My grandfather gave me the quilt my grandmother didnt get to finish before she died.  He drove all the way up here from Santa Barbara to do it in person.  He told me all the stories behind it.   And give me a book that the women that finished it made.  I was almost in -tears- but I didnt want to cry.  I hate it when people see me .c.ry.  Went to Pizzacato with my mom tonight. That was good.  We have very deep conversations.   About people.   And places.  And things.  Basically your everyday [proper] nouns.  Got a phone call tonight.  Strange to me. But probably not to the rest of the world.  |Someone tell me|, [whats going on?]
