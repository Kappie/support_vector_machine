So my dad was away til like 1:30... Chad came over... wasn't supposed to... but whatever... I'm getting away with it arn't I? We took the dog for a walk and stuff.. hmmm...  So I downloaded a ton of music today after Chad left, now I'm listening to that. Hmm what else...  We're going to lmy brothers friends house for a BBQ tonight... should be good, and its not like they're not nice or anything, plus Chad's going to the lake tonight anyway so it's not like I would get to see him again.  Melissa left for the campgrounds! Awww I'm gonna miss her so much.... she'll be back in three weeks for a bit but I'm going to be so bored without her to hang out with! Hopefully Jess and I can get together a few times before she goes to her dads on like the 6th of july or somthing like that.  So I figured it out, we have 73 days off school... that's like a fifth of a year... and hahah my brother has to go back to school like 3 weeks before I do! hahahah  Okay so I have to go... dad wants on the comp, I'll prolly add more later.
