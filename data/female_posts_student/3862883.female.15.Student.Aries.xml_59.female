In the book they losetheir minds because he has been away from real civilization for such a long time. The captain in the movie also loses his mind because he is away from the civilization that he was used to. For the unknown reason the two men lose thier minds and they start to take over "godlike" qualities such as debating what to do with peoples lives. In the book it was the African Americans and in the movie it was the Vietnamies.
