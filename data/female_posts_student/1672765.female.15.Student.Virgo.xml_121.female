If she got scared by it I knew I would but I didn't. It was good though. I thought it was a good storyline, and good movie but not that scary. I guess I can see why some people would get scared - jumping and stuff, but I did get a few laughs. I won't spoil it or anything but if you've seen it you probably know what I'm talking about with a strangish twist thing that comes around the unwinding of the climax I guess. You know what I'm talking about? Well, after that part I already had everything figured out. Maybe it's predictable, maybe I'm just good. Ha.  2. The Wedding Singer I just rented this because of my fancy of Billy Idol. I really haven't seen too many Adam Sandler movies but I never liked any of them. Don't kill me. But it seems to me he plays the same role over and over and the same humor all the time. And I don't really like that kind of humor. He's kind of silly. Maybe that's what everyone likes. Who knows? Anyway, before the movie there was an ad for the soundtrack. Culture Club! The Police! Billy Idol (of course)! Loads of cool stuff...So I was getting pretty excited. Then I found out Drew Barrymore was in it (all I knew was Billy Idol. That's all I cared about) so I figured it couldn't be but SO bad because I thought she was pretty cool. I'm not going to worry about spoiling it because it's a predictable movie and you've probably seen it. So when the poor guy got dumped and was lying around in bed I thought my stereo turned on by itself but ah no, Boys Don't Cry was on the movie. Awesome. Then when was it? I know I heard 99 Red Balloons. Great. And then Adam played that song he wrote and he said "I was listening to the Cure alot" blah. Ha. Nice song. Really liked that song. I have to admit. I'd give anything to be able to hate that song. You know the song I'm talking about?  So anyway, about the movie and not the music. It was pretty good. Yeah, I said pretty good. Not my favorite movie but definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen. I must admit I'm impressed and I just might, if given the chance watch another Adam Sandler movie, but of course, I wouldn't have my hopes up. This is the 3rd Sandler movie I've seen in full and I hated the other ones. So hey. Then of course Billy Idol, my star of the movie. Heh. Ha. If it wasn't Spring Break I'd just fast forward to the end and watch the end over again, but seeing as it is Spring Break I'll probably just watch the movie over again. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over again when I've just watched them. I can't even do this with the best movies but it's Spring Break. What else is there to do?  3.  Reservoir Dogs Yeah, if you like AFI you probably appreciate this movie a lot. It's why I rented it at least. Finally got to rent it. I keep forgetting. I liked this movie. Yes I did. I am very glad I liked it, too. I don't like wasting my time watching bad movies, you see. No, I don't just like it because of it's affiliation with AFI's first album. It's a good movie. I don't watch many movie like this, but after this one part I thought "Woah! Nice." I wonder if, if you've seen it, you know what part I'm talking about. Anyway, the end was totally awesome. If you can get through all the blood and violence and  swearing  it is totally good. Nobody else in my family has any desire to watch it, though, no matter how much I rave about it. Hey. Whatever. They don't know what they are missing.  I wonder...if I just have a mind-set to like it on the sake of AFI. I don't think so. I mean I couldn't, could I? If I thought of that assumption, right? It's a good movie. Isn't it a good movie?  That is all.
