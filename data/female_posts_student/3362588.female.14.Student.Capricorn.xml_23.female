I'm literally counting the days.  I know it won't be bad.  I'll do fine.  But it'll be so different..... so weird........  ahhhhhhhhh.  *hides under the bed*.  Sure, I want to go.  At the begining of the summer, this very situation was my dream.  I wanted to go to public school so bad, but wanted my parents to make the decision so if I didn't like it, it wouldn't be my fault.  So here I am.  Sheesh, Serena, make up your mind.  What do you want.  I guess that's the problem, I don't know what I want.  Who I want to be.  It's scary when you know that you could be anyone, anything you wanted to be, and have to choose.  You can only put off your desicion so long.     Wait, I might hesitate    Am I a minute to late?    This pressure's got me lettin', go    What if I'm wrong, will I still carry on    And end up where I belong    I've never felt this way before      Work was fun today.  I love those kids.  They're so awesome.  Just when you decide they are driving you insane, they do something and you love 'em even more.  Like Brandon, I hated Brandon at the beginging of the camp.  Such a punk rebel.  Know I like him alot.  Steven - I've always like Steven.  How could you not like Steven.  He always yells, "Serena!"  when I walk into the room.  He shows off for me on the diving board.  Gotta love that kid.      Yesterday it was Japan day.  It was hecka fun.  We made sushi, and oragami, and played soccar (not Japenese, but to heck with that)  Soccar was hecka fun.  James kept puting is feet on my lap afterwards when we were sitting on the bench.  Then he took of my shoes and threw them around.  And attacted me.  So me and Hilary told him to go bug Brian.  So they litterally attacted him.  tee hee.  We were like, "sorry, dude, wasn't my idea (i mean, it was.... but....)"  haha.     Had my first guitar lesson today.  Mom told Marsha Roby I wanted to learn guitar, so Mrs.  Roby offered to give me some tips.  She's really nice.  So I can play He's Got the Whole World now.  buahahaha.  Beat that, why don't ya!!!!  tee hee    I think I'll go play my guitar now.      -Jak
