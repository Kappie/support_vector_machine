But anyways....I woke up at 8am and got ready to go to Ryans. I was there at like 8:45am and I was sleepy. We were suposed to go get Ryan's new tattoo at 10 but we didnt go util 1pm. When we got there this guy did Kyle and Ryan's tatoo. Ryan didnt get a new one. Then we went to Ryan's aunt house....  When we were out at Ryan's aunts house. I fell asleep and Ryan tucked me in with a blanket and kissed my cheek and wispered in my ear..."I Love You!" It was so sweet. I love him.  Then we went to his house and did somethings and aet some food. Then we went to the pool hall and me and Ryan and Tony and Jimmy all played pool. It was fun but I got sick because of all the smoke. Then I came home and I want to talk to Ryan!!! I LOVE YOU RYAN!!!!
