This is a decision that affects the rest of my life. Do I get to pick any college that I want? Of course not, because my mother has popped out five children. All of whom, must go to college, paid for by my parents. Thus, I am told that I cannot attend any out of state college, nor any private college. I've always known I don't want to go to A or UT because they're huge schools and I really don't like crowds. So what does that leave me with? Basically, I'm left with my mother's alma mater: U of H. Now, it's not a bad school, but it's not where I want to go. Where is it that I want to go you ask? Why that would be Baylor University in Waco, Texas. You'd say, "No problem, that's in Texas. It follows the rules." Does it? Does it really? No, it doesn't. It's a private school. And private schools are considered to be out of the question. But Baylor is where I need to be. As of right now, I want to do something in the medical field, preferably the surgical field. I'd like to be a neurosurgeon. And if I have to stay in Texas for my colleging (oh yes, it's a word), I need to go to Baylor. Baylor is obviously the best institution for the field I'd like to pursue. All that I need to do is convince my parents. In order to do this, I have to add a new... oh curses I missed 11:11 by one minute... subject to my to-do list: write an essay explaining why I need to go to Baylor. I mean, I've got all summer. It'll be great. I'm going to make it into a big project and I'll have visual aids and everything. It'll be great. They'd have to let me go then. Right?
