The librarian has just emailed something to me that basically says "Hey, guess what?  You're incompetent and can't do anything right.  I'm sharing your shortcomings with everyone else I CC'd on this email.  By the way, you'll be in charge for the next two weeks, don't fuck everything up, but you probably will anyway and we'll be doing damage control for months afterwards."  Not in as many words, of course.  The condescension here is out of control!  Her opinion really doesn't matter to me, but now I'll be pissed off for the rest of the day.  I need a vacation and have two remaining weeks stored up, but I always have work on the mind, so what's the use?  I'm inspired to work on my novel, and have made some progress recently, but I also have a beast of a take-home paralegal studies exam to work on due Thursday.
