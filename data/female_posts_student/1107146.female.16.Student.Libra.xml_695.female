That's a good start. But...a little more juice is in order, I think. UP, LINDS, UP!!!! Yes, I can tell. Level 6 is good. Look for Eisen, he might show up from time to time.  Ok, this is me doing the Dance of Disbelief. Rosie. There's a rule about non-sequiters and since all of your posts tend to be in them, I think we need to define a line as to how many pleas for real psychological help you can get.   I woke up early today. Last night was cool, Linds. Yeah, none of the list got used, but we had fun. Then again, the list isn't that great.   Blah. I'm still talking because I don't want to work on English yet. Hate.  Beautiful hate.
