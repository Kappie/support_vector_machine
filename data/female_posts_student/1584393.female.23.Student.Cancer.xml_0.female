It's only half the size of my hand and the pillow is just folded up material. That cat has been with me since highschool, a forgotten birthday gift from someone or other. Its been with me through five moves, three boyfriends, a degree and numerous bouts with depression. I can't even remember who gave it to me. It could be even older than I think it is. I remember it being caked with dust at several points. Laying packed for months at a time. Sitting out of place in my nicely adult and classy bedroom, its orange-pink highlight clashing with the dark wood and purple fabric. Its childish air looking out of place admist the classic black lamps, white porcelain and wrought-iron votive. So its here in my study, amongst the chaos that is my desk. It sits beside a plaster angel candleholder covered in tarnished brass paint. My confirmation candle stark white against the greenish brass. Books litter the desk with sheets of paper thick like carpet. It's kin to the white-purple dragon incense burner, its bashful sleep interrupted by puffs of smeet smoke coming from its nostrils. It's covered in glitter and sits on tarnished silver coasters. Tarnish seems to be a running theme. Awfully apt and terribly pretentious, but still, a running theme it is. Continued with the wrought-iron candleholder, empty since the fragile glass cups smashed. Three fake flowers poke haphazardly through the holes. A broken jewellery box lays open beside it.   I can't work out if the surrounding reflect me or I reflect them.
