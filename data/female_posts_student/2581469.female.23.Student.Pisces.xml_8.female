(and there's the whole driving around a city you don't know very well all day in the heat and the traffic. add that to the mix.)   so i took some applications from places that aren't even looking for help. i emailed my resume to a few places i found on the university's job board. i asked around. i got a lead from a lady who suggested a coffee shop in a casino - they have a high turnover rate, which is not really a  good  sign. but i kept missing the lady i was going to talk to. so i'll be trying again when i drive back over to reno next tuesday.   i'm driving back and forth because i have no place to live. my not having a place to live is in direct relation to my not having a job. (imagine a rock and a hard place here. or a catch-22.) i don't have enough money to really put a deposit and first month's rent down on a place. and i think having a place to live in the city i'm going to be working (and going to school) in would help. immensely.   to recap: i need a job. in order to get a job i need a place to live. but in order to get a place to live i need money. and to get money i need a job.   i did have a plan. originally, my brother who lives there (and has a good job and an extra $2500 a month - he likes to tell me about his financial situation.. saying things like "it's weird.. i just don't know what to do with this extra money.." all the while i'm thinking of ways to steal this $2500 from him every month. that's more money than i've ever saved up. but. i digress. end of parentheses.) was supposed to have bought a house. and i was going to live with him. for not very much money. so i was going to have a cheap place to live while going to graduate school. but. it hasn't worked out that way.   and i think he's starting to realize - it's his couch i'm sleeping on after all - how  much  things haven't worked out. which is good.   which sounds like i'm taking him for granted, or expecting a lot out of him, or not appreciating him, or being selfish.. but it's not really that way at all. he's family after all.. and he's the one who offered in the first place..   but that wasn't my original idea i was working on when i started this. it was the fact that i'm unemployed. and job searching really shtinks. and the only real way to get a job one might enjoy is through connections. networking. which isn't all that nice when one moves to a new city.   it's frustrating.   and that's where you'll find me now.   frustrated.
