I leaned against a hair-defiled porcelain sink and nodded mutely as Dr. Symes, whose ruthless efficiency in diagnosing and belittling her students' emotional traumas is well known and feared throughout the music building, lectured me about relaxing.  She was surprisingly receptive as I recounted all the stress-related melodies I've had over the years:  TMJ from years of horn playing and gritting my teeth while I'm class; a screwed-up back from catering and lifting way heavy bowls and platters of food in and out of vans; and the ever-present headaches from just being a highstrung, hypochondriachal, basket case.  Her remedy:  Find a way to either get rid of some classes or tell my supervising professor to kiss his ass when he abuses my time and sanity.  I'm not supposed to run his personal errands, but that's kinda what I find myself doing in lieu of finishing assignments or, like, showering.  If that didn't work, she said, get out of town for a while.  Take a semester off.  I'm no good to them if I can't even handle my own personal life.  Her destress or go home orders weren't completely devoid of incentive for me.  My ed. professors have  intimated that their retirement or promotions to the upper echelons of music school admin. (heh) are imminent and that maybe they'd want someone young and fresh to take over when that time comes.  They're worried that the youngness and freshness might be already sucked dry by the time I attempt a doctoral degree Since retreating home to the Bushwhacker Capital of the World and licking my wounds in the comfort of my parent's home isn't an entirely plausible option, I'm destressing.  I threw away all the refined sugars, coffee, tea, pop, and fatty stuff out of my cabinets and refrigerator in a nutrition blitz that left Jay silently mourning his grandmother's ginger snaps while he gnawed on baby carrots for lunch.  I have planned every spare minute of my day with every form of holistic exercise available in my town:  Tai chi on Mondays and Fridays at the armory, lifting weights early on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, running on the nature trails on Tuesday and Thursday, and I even managed to multitask quality time with Jay by getting in a leisurely walk with him on either Saturday or Sunday.  I bought herbal teas and smoothie ingredients, yoga books and Pilates tapes, and I'm looking into a spa day sometime before the wedding.  The problem with all my super-zen activities is...they're freaking stressing me out!  Tai chi at the armory conflicts with my usual gym time and it only leaves me thirty minutes before class.  Since all my coffee is making groundwater (well, groundcoffee) at some landfill, I'm having massive caffeine withdrawal and I fell asleep in class today.  I love the yoga books (well, at least the inside dust jacket) but I don't have time to read them since I'm behind on my chapters for grad sem, and that spa day...I'm going to have to save for weeks and weeks just to afford a pedicure!  Jay and I don't even have the same schedule on weekends, so scheduling a day trip to a scenic walking path for this weekend ended in a battle of our planners and a half-hearted promise to work something in. Dr. Symes suggested an online course in stress management but I checked into it and it has assignments.  With grades and due dates.  For people who already can't handle the due dates and grades they have in their normal lives.  Good thinking, MU.  One good thing, as I armed myself to the hilt with relaxation therapy at the bookstore today, I popped Jeff Buckley's Live at Sin-E into my shopping bag.  Mmmm...I think he's my new Chet Baker.
