I was kinda nervous about what there surprise was, actually I was very scared.           I guess Champ will be the Cross Country Mascot, Im gonna have to go to the pet store tomorrow and get him some things. Im also gonna have to keep it away from Skittles, he doesn't really like when I give other animals attention, but i really like my new Hamster, as long as it doesn't shit in my hand......
