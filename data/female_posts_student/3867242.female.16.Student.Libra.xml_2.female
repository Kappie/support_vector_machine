I can't wait to get out of this stupid state...I don't care if I have family and friends here...this place is booooorrrrrrrrrinnnnnnnggggg!! Anyways today been an alright day. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night though...Ihad a lot on my mind..and I can't never sleep when I have a dilema or when my brain has the juices going at a fast pace. I woke up around 7:30 this morning because my stupid cat is in heat and was moaning outside my door. So I gave up and got up and drank my daily dose of good ol' O.J. This afternoon I visited my grandma, watched my usual soap operas, and then made up for lost sleep last night by taking a nap. I really have no big plans this week until Sunday when I'm going to Kennywood with Day and hopefully Ashley C. I just pray that it doesn't rain tommorrow because I don't how much more I can take of this crappy weather! It's making me depressed..especially since my skin is shade of Dracula. Whatever...I'm going to stop whining and make the best of it...sigh...
