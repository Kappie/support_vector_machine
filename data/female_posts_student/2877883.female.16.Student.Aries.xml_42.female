No, I have so much freaking vacation homework already, it's so dumb.    13 page reading+ response essay =ewwww  Start travel project (Venice here I come) except not really.  I wish from doing these projects we could free tickets to these places.  Yeah right.  How could I forget.  We go to Wachusett.  Umm yes long long times a million Bio paper due May 3rd.  The Juniors' papers were due today and some people had to stay up until 3 in the morning doing them, lovely.    Yes, English research presentation on the Boston Police Strike in 1919. Fun.  Plus, rewrite for after vacation.    Oh man, this will be a fun time.   Yuck.  Except definitely need bargain shopping day with Jacqui.  It shall be a par-tay.  Also, I love my cool sorority sisters b/c they leave me wicked cool comments such as "horay" and "poop on me".    Word up, homeboys (or girls really).
