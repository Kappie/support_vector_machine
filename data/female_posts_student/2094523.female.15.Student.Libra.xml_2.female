Impressive sure..but it sure as hell doesn't impress your heart. As a kid im sure u wanted to be a firefight, a dancer, an actress, a soccer star....whatever our parents arent. I mean come on! u never said u wanted to be an accountant when u were 5 yrs old...why wud u be one when ure 30? thats just wasting ure life away... why do u have to take everythin so seriously anyways? lifes not about this.. its about what we're not.. coz look what we've all become..
