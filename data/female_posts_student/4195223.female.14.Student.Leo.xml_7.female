He Snores    He hogs the sheets    He's almost as big as me    He wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning wanting me to put him outside... when that takes a whole 5 minutes out of my sleep time.    If I don't let him out ((and I normally don't)) He chews up my things...    He burps    He farts...                                 Now for the reasons I let him sleep with me...     He makes me feel safe.                   Don't we think the Bad out weighs the good on this one?Â¿ I thought so. ((Yawns)) Well good morning anyways ;)
