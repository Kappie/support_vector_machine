On September 8th, 2004, I will officially be an eighth grader. This is my last year of Middle School. In about a year I will be venturing into high school! Anyways, though my summer has been pretty good thus far, I can't help but feel excited for the eighth grade. My fellow peers and I shall rule the school... Plus, we get to have our veryown wing to use. It's goingto be great... Anyhow, I'm notcompletely wound up for just those reasons. No, I'macting all nervous and excited because I plan on changing a lotabout myself this year and I can hardly wait.When I enter the eighth grade, I'll be the person that I want to be...    Here's a listof the changesI'll be making.     ExternalChanges=        Clothing:  For this year, I am changing my entire wardrobe. Finally, I'll escape the terrible striped pants and my mother's tee-shirts thatI wore all last year in the seventh grade. This year, I'm planning on getting a larger variety of clothes. I plan on getting some knee length skirts, capris, more fitting tee shirts, nice and comfortablepants, shorts, etc...     Hairstyles:  Another thing that I am changing about myself this year is my hairstyle. I always keep my hair down. This year I think I'm going to put it more up. I'm thinking of head bands and loose pony tails. I might evendo pig tails every once and awhile.     Internal Changes=        Knowledge:  This year I am going to pay attention more to my studies. Last year I sort of just shrugged them off. So, this year I'm going to study much more then I did last year so I gain knowledge and actually understand it.     Happiness : Last year I was positivelymiserable.When I go into the eighth grade, I plan on being a more happier person. Instead ofremainingmutewhen I have a problem or suggestion for something, I am going to voice my opinion. I am NOT going to be so silent.Since, not speaking made merather unhappy around all of my friends and others, I am hoping that I'll be much more enjoyable to be with after fixing this little problem.    So, there is my list. It sounds lame, doesn't it? Ah, who cares? It's my life...    And I'm gone...
