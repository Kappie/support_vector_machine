I have a "to do" list to fill an entire page... anyway.  Instead of accomplishing anything today, I went shopping; well, after I worked for a couple hours first, of course.  I bought this really cute lavendar  brown skirt and matching lavendar sweater to wear to a wedding this Saturday.  My friend Glen invited me and since the guy getting married is a friend  coworker and everyone at his workplace thinks we're boy/girlfriend, I was put on the invitation as " Friend".  That was strange.  I've never been the 2nd part of an invitation.  Guess it had to happen eventually.  It'll be weird going to a wedding with Glen (oops, should I have said that?  What if he reads this?)  Oh well.  I've never been to a wedding with him before.  Actually, I've never been to a wedding where I didn't know the bride and groom or really anyone before.        Just the idea of marrying someone seems odd to me.  I'm the type of person who likes to know and evaulate beforehand how something's going to work before jumping into anything.  So this concept of spending the rest of your life with someone without knowing if it'll work out or if you'll even be happy is... scary.  What if it doesn't work out?  What if it does?  I like surprises to a point, but not when it may mess up my plans.  I guess that makes me common, huh?  I mean, who revels in the unknown and unexpected, never getting frustrated because they couldn't do something?  Lucky people.  Anyway, what was I talking about before I got sidetracked?        The wedding should be interesting since the bride is Vietnamese and I've heard they're going to serve Vietnamese food at the reception.  I've never had that kind of food before, but I've been warned to ask first.  Glen told me that.  I was a little nervous at first that there'd be dancing because I suck at it.  I've never learned, never had an opportunity.  The only dances I know are from the 50s.  Yeah, not exactly wedding reception steps.  But I asked Glen if there'd be dancing and he said he didn't know, but at the last Vietnamese wedding he went to there wasn't.  Then I explained why I asked that question and he promised if there was dancing that he wouldn't ask me.  Whew, that's a relief!  I just don't want to make a fool of myself.
