Things with Mike have taken a new turn, and he is no longer the  urlLink wrong one  as I thought he was.  In fact, he's feeling more and more right by the second.  OK, now that sounds a little ... uh, what's the positive version of 'nihilist'?  Hmm, dunno.  But it sounds far more decisive than it really is.  All of the reasons I initially thought it wouldn't ever work with Mike are the same reasons that I am totally digging this guy.    He's young: yeah, well, so's Anil, and it was never an issue.  It may just be that Mike looks his age, whereas Anil looks more than his age, (although, with his baby-face Mike will likely look like a child perpetually.)  Common interests: it's called sharing.  As in, he shares his interests with me, some of them I dig and some not so much, and I share with him--same deal.  But the places where we differ, we learn, and perhaps that's where a lot of the affection is rooted too.  And don't think I haven't already considered the "same shit, different pile" paradigm.  Am I being rash and hasty in getting involved with Mike?  Absolutely.  But since when have I behaved any way, other than totally heedlessly self-indulgent?  And with that in mind (ie: heedless self-indulgence) here is the ultimate reason why we're hitting it off so well: he is crazy about me.  And he lets me care about him without any restraint.  Anil wanted me to play games, he liked when I was hard-to-get, he didn't ever want to know how I  really  felt about him.  Mike lets me be every bit as affectionate as I want, no game-playing required.    Sooo... I like Mike a lot.  I'm gonna start carting him around to meet my friends, see what the general opinion is, etc.  The post-surgery instructions confirmed my mission: no sex for four weeks.  It will really give me a unique opporunity to explore just how much a part of a relationship sex really is.  Ally really likes him, which is a bonus  (as an aside: Mike and Ally coordinated a secret effort to plant a teddy-bear and get-well card in my room pre-surgery; he showed up with one of his most eligible friends, Trev, who is now desperate to get to know Ally.  When Mike told me this, my protective-sister instincts flared up immediately.  I protested that there was no way it could fly--he's 22, she's 19.  And Mike, gaah, counters with the argument that it's pretty much the same difference in age as he and I.  Shut uuuuuup !)  Now all I have to do is warm up my parents to the idea of a new boyfriend.  Mom has not been doing well lately.  Aside from all the stress of my surgery, she's also looking forward to an emergency root-canal later this week.  She is in a lot of pain, and has been for sometime, though she ignored it initially thinking it would go away.  I really want her to meet Mike, and I know she'll really like him.  But one thing that she made a point of saying just after I started seeing him casually was that she wasn't ready to meet anyone new yet.  It would take her a little more time to get over Brent.  If that isn't just the most misplaced irony, I don't know what is.  So this is me, cautious but optimistic, trying very hard to keep my head and heels in their correct fully upright position.
