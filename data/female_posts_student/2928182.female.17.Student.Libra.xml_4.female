It's the feeling that "bla" describes perfectly. And like I'll feel tired, sleepy at night, but not want to go to sleep. I start getting frustrated about stupid things, and that frustration just adds to the feeling. I don't know what else to say, other than bla.... They need to make that an official word or something.
