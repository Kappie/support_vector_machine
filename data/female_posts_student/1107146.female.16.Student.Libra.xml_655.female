I sort of gave up on the musician thing for a while, but Nick Bruey is out of band now and is going to help me record...'haps he will join?, or Alex will be motivated?  And you "typoed" a typo. Fascinating!  SURELY I SHALL! Now...I don't know which CDs you have. Abby has a copy of "the demo" that we sort of changed since then, so if you have that one, then I could post those. I could anyway if you get a copy, since I delete a lot of them that I just don't think I'm meant to do yet. But...  THE CLASSICS:  I'm thinking  Broken Me , and  Little Rhyme  and  My Solution ...what else was there?  Close My Eyes ?!? Those four right quick.   Broken Me  by Stranglebox  All wrong, I know this ain't the right way Playing ping-pong, I am the toy of my fate I shoulda known that it all would come back around I wasn't thinking, and all the sudden I'm down I'm like a fly trapped on a field full of glue My brain is ransacked, all telling me what to do I'll never hear you, never ever again I'll make these words true As soon as I put down this pen  Hey hey, see me in between See this twisted dream, it's just a seam Of what I might have been Hey hey, you're a broken lie To you it don't seem right To waste another day, it seems So loose the broken me who bleeds  So long, I couldn't take anymore I guess I got strong, and I walked right out the door You'll never hear me, but you know I'll never care I had a vision, selfish, you blew it like air I'm just so tired, don't wanna do this again It's uninspired, but I loved losing my head I'm going out there, I'm falling into the trap Nothing left to share And it came to the point that I snapped   Chorus   Something has hit me and I'll never be the same (2x) Bleed me out   Chorus  x 2  WHEE!!! I had fun recording that one.   Little Rhyme  by Stranglebox  Father father, where'd you go? Calling out to no one Empty, sullen, all alone Mercy to my mission Brother brother, moaning low Living ruination Crying crying, time is slow Sleep in devastation  So I pray you'll be alright Cuz all my other prayers have died And I hope you'll turn out right Since you've been otherwise denied Now I say my little rhyme Little comfort passing time Cuz you had every right to lie And for that I'll say goodbye  Mother mother, no one knows Just how deep this chasm Sunder pluder, I did so I've produced this spasm Sister sister, I'd forego Anything to save me Killed it killed it, bloody clothes Falsity depraves me   Chorus   and the Interlude   Chorus   Whee!! Alex played the drums on that one! That was the only one, out of all of these. And the next one...nobody's really heard the real version...except for Rosie cuz she was there when we did the talent show tryout. I lost the CDs. The only place it is anymore is on my computer upstairs safely tucked away in the harddrive. So you'd have to go there if you wanted to listen to it. And it SUCKS! So yes.   My Solution  by Stranglebox  Asylum was the answer They opened doors and let me in And told me time was not unmaking They told me I could finally win I seek now, retribution Raised my eyes and soon I saw The steel and lonesome of my prison Bang my head against the stone cold floor  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just Walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and  Fade me away  Silence, now my reason, I sat alone inside myself I gave the all that I had in me They stole my life and gave me hell Addiction was the cancer And God, the price I paid And slowly dying, I surrendered My poisoined soul as it fades to gray   Chorus    Chorus  x 2 Now that I've laid my life to waste My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away My solution, I'm gonna find out the only way to escape And my solution, that I break free from this cage  I haven't heard that song in a long time. And now, my personal favourite...well except for these two new ones but none of you have heard them yet, and they pretty much are not done. So...   Close My Eyes  by Stranglebox (surprised?)  Hey you there, are you listening? I won't be ignored again Outside here it's a lonely place, and I'm Trying to figure out how this began  I'm apart and struck at the heart The whole world hears my cries And you thieved to the point of deceit But if you care, please close my eyes Another down, my pain is renowned The thorn is in my side Hollow feats make a man of the meek And if you care, please close my eyes  Hey, I'm here and I'm thinking about Why I never went away I'm still trying hard to live without You're sweet touch within my brain   Chorus   Sololudethingy   Chorus , repeat the last line a few times, voila.  And more to come if wanted!
