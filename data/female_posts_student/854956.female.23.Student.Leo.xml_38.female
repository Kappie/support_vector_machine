Zack finally got in touch with me.  :-)  I was quite happy about that.  Oddly, I missed him.  Not like in a "I want to smother him with my kisses and then screw him" kind of way, but a "I miss talking to him and him making me laugh" kind of way.  :-)  The email addy he was using he cancelled because of some hacking stuff that happened.  Anyhow, he's using a different addy now, and so he and I have gone back to emailing a lot... and he continues to make comments about visiting.  haha  I just can't stop thinking of how odd it'd be if something developed there down the road.  How funny!  Anyway... classes are going well.  I have some tests coming up the end of this month already!  Wow!  They don't waste any time, do they?  I'm just excited because I think the chances of me getting all A's this semester is actually a GOOD chance.  ; )  Then this summer I'm going to try and knock out about 12 hours of coursework over the 2 sessions.  I have to get stuff done.  Then next Fall I'll be taking my music classes.  :-)  Band, basic skills 1and aural skills 1 of music.  I really don't have that much left.  And the more aspirations I have to get things done... the more I stop and realize, I actually CAN be done by May 2004 instead of Dec 2004.  :-)  So I may only have 2 big semesters left (instead of 3).  YAY!  Anyhow... we'll see.  I'll post more later on... probably Friday or Saturday.        urlLink  postCount('22Jan2003');
