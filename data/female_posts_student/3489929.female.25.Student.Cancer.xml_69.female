Lisa said I look pregnant. So damn it, even though there's ZERO chance in hell that it is actually the case, I FEEL PREGNANT.  ANYBODY GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?         Grrrrrrrrrrr.    Updates:      Friday: handled work situation with Posh; back on speaking terms (she apologized for being a "c" word)      Saturday: hung out with my brother John (the one NOT in Texas, obviously), went to the arcade and shot some pool (won 1, lost 3), dragged him to Burlington- dodging those damn saleswomen who think I'm fucking knocked up (I really wanted to kick some cashier ass)- and spent almost $40.00 on baby paraphenalia for Stacked/Foxy's baby shower (Baby Snoopy theme), went to Books-A-Million where I learned that my Nintendo-generation brother does, in fact, know how to read and actually does it outside of a school setting (do  Residence Evil  books count as literature?- well, at least he's reading), and realized that my brother is turning into a replica of the man he most despises in this world- our father (John has some daddy issues- let's just say, my dad has not exactly treated John as he treated Nick or me, and John does have solid grounds to feel resentment).       Today: did contortions in the bathtub whilst Lisa gave me a pedicure (long story and not nearly as bad as it sounds), went to Foxy's baby shower out in the boondocks and invoked the name of the Lord ("Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ, just show us where your house of worship is!") when we could not find the church, proceeded to say "God damn" in said church (oops), had way too much chocolate candy and cake (pukesville), determined that I was one of the few people who seemed to actually follow Foxy's registry in buying my gifts (for the sake of cataloguing, Lisa and I got her a Baby Snoopy diaper bag, bowl  matching spoon, rattle bottle, pacifiers, bib and burp cloth, teething ring, stuffed rattle toy, and baby grooming kit), got lost on the way home in the middle of Hicksville, where I was terrified that dirty redneck cannibals would get us, and was almost killed by Lisa's crazy tailgating on the interstate system when something I did (I forget what) made her crack up laughing.       Busier weekend than normal.      Now I just need sleep. Lots and lots of sleep. I am not looking forward to the week. Week one of new diet. Oh, joy. Oh, rapture.
