More likely it’s the culture we subscribe to, and which music most fits into our societal standing.  Ask my little brother why he walks around the house screaming “I’M SLIM SHAAAY-DEEE YESS I’M THA REEAL SHAY-DEEE” (and then pretends he’s the Ramones’ biggest fan “hey Soph, you know Jack Ramone? Did he die?” “err...there was no Jack in the Ramones..”) and the answer you’ll get is simple:  “Because I like it.”  Ask my big brother why  he  walks around singing “EASSY LOIKE SUNDAAAAY MORNENNNN YEEEEEAHA AHOOHHE EHE (don’t go there...) and the answer is inevitably similar "MAN!! BECAUSE MIKE PATTON IS GOD MAN!!"  (translation "Because I like it.") Ask them to swap headphones, though, and all you'll get is a face to rival the evil look coined by the cast of   the Bold and the Beautiful  .    Treasure: 1, Trash Nil.      Now this perplexes me greatly, as it totally negates the research I've done. Out of the 10 people whom I approached at Uni today and queried as to their taste in music, 8 people replied that they generally love all music. Asked whether they liked Eminem, and only 1 said yes. Asked whether they liked Delta Goodrem, and..well..for further reference, don't ever approach the socialist stall with such questons. So doesn't that say that  realistically , they  don't  love all music? I mean how can you love all music...but hate Eminem, Delta, Avril or Shaggy?     Trash: 1, Treasure: 1.    Music is like religion, only it doesn't (often) start wars: completely subjective.  So, if we all love and appreciate music, why is there such a great divide between genres? I've fallen into this trap as lately as today, when I got chatting to the guy next to me only to find out he was a massive fan of D-12. I judged him by his musical tastes, yet I myself am a believer in loving "all music." Perhaps, if, like religion, we stopped inflicting our musical tastes on others ("Mannnnn that sucks! Why are you buying  that   album!?" "uhh..I..wanted..") we'd all be one happy family? Or maybe we really are so finely tuned in on one genre that to challenge this would create societal breakdown...meldrama aside, you get my drift.   After all, how often do you see someone at a rock gig wearing a sweatband and bling bling? It's not just the music we're getting when we buy an album, it's a whole society, the key to a world only the elite can go.  ---  As Luciano Pavarotti once said.." You don't need any brains to listen to music "  And hey, it's probably better that way. If we stopped overanalyzing music, maybe we'd enjoy the music for it's strengths and not the connotations it has.
