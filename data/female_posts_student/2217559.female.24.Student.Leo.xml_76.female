It started with a really bizarre dream a fwe afternoons ago.  I dreamt that myself, my mom, Richard, Tineke and Helen had decided to take the glacier helicopter ride. We missed the ship and I had formal the next night. I had a huge panick moment. I actually woke up from the dream with tears streaming down my face. (Of course, very dramatic.) Then I fell back asleep and dreamt that I had a penis which was really, really bizarre. The weird thing is I didn't notice I had one - it just sort of appeared and then I couldn't figure out if I had it for my entire life or it was recent. Anyway, that dream has kicked off a series of very weird events. I got an email from someone that I haven't heard from in about 2 years maybe. That was really strange especially because I was so excited to hear from her.  My mother keeps writing me about this Van Morrison CD but I guess that's not that strange, if you know my mother. Hmm, things are just weird right now. I am wondering if I am going to wake up with a third arm or something.   Today, I didn't do anything really. I woke up at 11:00AM, went to work for about half an hour, then went back to sleep until about 4:00.  I talked to my friend Kevin on the phone which was really cool. Got to catch up with him for a bit. My cell has been working quite a bit this cruise which has been wonderful. I forget everyone has their own lives going on though, so when I call I expect everyone to drop what they are doing and talk to me. Selfish me.   Well, we are officially on the countdown now guys. I have 13 days left. I start training my replacement this evening and I can't wait to handover the pager and VS mobile phone to her. I am so tired of hearing it ring!!!  Lots of love and see everyone -PADDY- soon. Shell
