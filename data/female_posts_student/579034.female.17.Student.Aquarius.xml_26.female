My chem teacher is really nice so I think he's gunna get me through it and I kinda understand what's going on so far... Spanish is going to be a bitch, I can't stand it anymore... Church History is just a joke... Math don't seem too bad... YET. What else is there? Um... English seems easy... we had to read this thing called "The Black Cat" by Edgar Allen Poe... there is only one phrase I can think of to describe this man ::clears throat:: aHhHhHhHhHhH! Wack Attack!!!!!! US History seems okay really... I mean we learned most of this stuff already... I just think my teachers are going to go into a lot of detail but it's okay cause I'm good with that kind of stuff as long as like they say it out loud... but.. okay I'm out.. I'm talkin to Derrick's lil bro CCCCOOORRRRRYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! lol peace much love XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO
