My brothers friends are over and we are going swimming and I was going to go but I just now decided I didn't want to.  I need to sleep...I only have one full day left. :(   I am FREAKING OUT.  What if i'm not funny?!  I can't even blog when I am there. I will suffer from lack of bloging. Sigh.  It's going to be OK! *blows in...blows out*
