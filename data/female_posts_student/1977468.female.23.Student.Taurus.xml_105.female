I even love them as I loving place them in the washing machine. What I don't understand is what happens IN the washing machine, because the stylin jeans I put in come out with none of the kickass left.  These polos im wearing (DONT JUDGE) were awesome in the store. But WHY  SELL  A  PRODUCT  if its going to pull a  SWITCHO   CHANGEO  on the  CUSTOMER  after the   FIRST  WASH ?  Thats wrong!!  I read the tag! I followed the directions! But these jeans spite me with their uber plain not-worth-a-second-look texture and tone. The jeans I bought had brown hues.   Why I am the sole victim of tragity? Like yesterday, I opened a pack of my Scooby Doo fruitsnacks- and they were ALL YELLOW. Who eats the yellow? Well I did, I was forced to. How many people does that happen to? No one I've met.  My summer is half over. I'm going back to school on monday. I'm glad though you know? It will keep me busy and productive, and there are few thing I consider more invigorating then writing a paper. It puts you in the moment- its do or die. You have to make numerous split second decisions. Do I elaborate on point A, or reference point C to example B? How far is  too  far over the paper's max charactor limit? How much can the  teacher  handle?  I've been spending it alright though. Lots of relaxing, and writing (not enough though) and yesterday me and eric had our first airsoft battle. I think the height of the evening was hearing eric scream each time I hit him. Eric's height was probably watching me come at him on the mower (as if that would someone give me an advantage).
