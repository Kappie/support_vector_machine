From the darkness I can look so beautiful, and from a distance so perfect, but when you get up close I am nothing but scribbles, and when you bring me into the light, I am hideous. I want to think of myself right now, as a blank canvas. I want to be something new. I don't want to be a different person, I just want to be better. I'm sure this is making no sense, but it's all part of the process I suppose. I just know so many beautiful people, and living in a house so full of ugliness has to be having an effect on me and that's a scary thought. I can't allow myself to be like my family.  Today, Rem told me to download this amazing song by Emiliana Torrini, called "If You Go Away", and I completely fell in love with this girl. She has this otherworldly sound to her voice. Its gorgeous. Then I realized I had heard one of her songs in the movie "Crazy/Beautiful", which was a terrible movie but had a killer soundtrack. That was the song "To Be Free" and MY GOD I AM IN LOVE WITH HER! I am obsessed with beauty right now, so I have listening to such pretty songs and looking at poetry and art. Maybe I am going about this the wrong way, but the way I see it, if I surround myself with it, it will inspire me to become it.  People are distracting me and I lost my train of thought...  Just to sum up my entry, I have included the lyrics to "If You Go Away".  Emiliana Torrini - If You Go Away If you go away On this summers day Then you might as well Take the sun away All the birds that flew In the summer sky When our love was new And our hearts were high And the day was young And the nights were long And the moon stood still For the night bird's song  If you go away (x3)  But if you stay I'll make you a day Like no day has been Or will be again We'll sail on the sun We'll ride on the rain And talk to the trees And worship the wind  But if you go I'll understand Leave me just enough love To fill up my hand  If you go away (x3) If you go away As I know you will You must tell the world To stop turning 'til you return again If you ever do For what good is love Without lovinâ€™ you? Can I tell you now As you turn to go I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello  If you go away (x)  But if you stay I'll make you a night Like no night has been Or will be again I'll sail on your smile I'll ride on your touch I'll talk to your eyes That I love so much  But if you go I won't cry Though the good is gone From the word goodbye  If you go away (x3)  If you go away As I know you must There is be nothing left In this world to trust Just an empty room Full of empty space Like the empty look I see on your face And I'd have been the shadow Of your shadow If it might have kept me By your sideIf you go away (x5)
