So me and Chris helped picked them up. I got $20 for it. Yay. Then after that we went to Wally World. I bought me 2 binders, Spongebob Rocker notebook, and white out. Lol, I'm going to get more school supplies later. Then after that we went to Sam Goody. I bought me H.I.M.'s cd: Razorblade Romance. It's really good. Then we went to JC Penney. I bought me some jeans, they fit really good, and they are long. Just how I like them. Then I bought a black shirt and it has a cherry on it. I got a Snoopy shirt, it looks old skool like. I also got me a blue shirt with some stuff on it. Anyways after that I took a nap. Then Tregory called me. Happy Me. We are going on 4 months, which is my longest relationship at all. I'm so happy. I'm going to buy him some boxers for his birthday, and then give him like $20. Right now I'm watching Star Wars Epi II, Hayden Christensen looks good in this movie. LoL. Samuel L. Jackson, is one of my favorite actors. Fav Actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, Richard Gere, George Clooney...Fav Actresses: Julia Roberts, Halle Berry, Uma Thurman, I don't have that many actresses. Lol, Anyways I don't know what else to say, but I just feel like blogging. It's fun. I don't want to go to Band Camp, I don't want to see some people, and I don't want to wake up early. At least I'll have something to do. I haven't played my clarinet for awhile, so I really suck. Poopy. I can't wait till school starts, these are the classes I am going to take. Spanish, Family Dynamics, Band, Geometry, Chemistry, English II, and History. Adriano's mom teaches spanish through fibro-net. "Hola! Como Estas?" Then Mrs. Moncreif teaches Family Dy. I think. Mr. Mac teaches band. I don't know if he'll let us play the goodmusic. I don't know who will teach me Geometry, because Mrs. Burton left to Holmes. :( She was one of my favorites teachers. Then I don't know who teache Chemistry...Its not Mrs. Nail. She was cool. Then English II, might be Mrs. Reed, the evil teacher...And History. I don't know. Some teachers left...Anywho, I don't know where we will have the football games, because they tore up the field and everything. I'm definately going to the basketball games because Tregory is on the team. :) Happy Me. Yes Yes Yes. Happy me. Tomorrow I'm going to church, so yay. I haven't been to church for a few weeks cause my ride has been in Florida.Lol, Anyways my brother wants me to get off, so later.
