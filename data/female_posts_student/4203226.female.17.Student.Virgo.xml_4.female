Here i go again:  ANYWAYS...even though it was a totally pointless message I just wanted everyone to know what a letdown summer has been. I mean seriously, this is our last few months to just be high school students with no resposibilities and nothing to lose...this should be the time where we spend each day like we'll never see eachother again, making awesome memories that will start conversations with our new college friends.  This summer could have been fun besides the fact that there is absolutly NO sunshine ... no hot college guys visiting for the summer....which equals NO SUMMER FLING!! (cassandra n les) ...no spending money= because all $ is being spent on stuff like toothpaste, staplers, and towels...Its just not right!!! I think we should be taking this summer more seriously and really do something...i just don't know what. Thats for everyone else to think up of...Im just here to motivate...not to think!! seriously...  Ok well now im done...so Im going to stop...now... ;)
