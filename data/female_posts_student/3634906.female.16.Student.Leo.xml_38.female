We assume Mariah will not be attending. This is only an assumption. But we believe she would like to stay with her mom and she doesnt want to ruin our even number.    The weather is forecasted as: Partly Sunny with highs of 81.     The river should be a good depth. We are predicting that we wont have to worry about scraping along the bottom. YES!!! No having to get out and push the canoe!!    Amanda and I may rampage and dump the others canoes. We are being crabby girls.    Gabby will be thinking of Brittany tomorrow because Brittany really wants to be there. (I'm hoping she had a fantastic birthday. And I hope to talk to her real soon.) Well i have another NEWS FLASH but it has nothing to do with canoeing.    Gabby is miserable without you. Wishing you were talking to her. Wishing you actually meant what you said when you said that you cared and that you would never hurt me and that I mean a lot to you. Wishing that you know this in some way and that you do care. Wishing that tomorrow you will call me and leave me a message saying you miss me. Wishing that one of these wishes will come true. Wishing that you were here to give me a big toasty hug goodnight. Wishing that you werent so hurt. Wishing I could change what happened. Wishing that I had the guts to tell you the truth. Wishing that these wishes come true. goodnight y'all  -gabby
