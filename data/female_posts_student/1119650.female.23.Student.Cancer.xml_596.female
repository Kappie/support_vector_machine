The way you touch my hand  It makes me smile,  You make me feel so beautiful.   And when I see the loving in your eyes I know its more than physical.   Wherever time may take you In your life  Remember this was beautiful.   You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful yeah, yeah.   When I wake up in the morning  Wake up in the night  I know everything's gonna be all right.   No matter where I go  No matter what I do  All I want is to be with you   All I want is to be with you 'Cause you're so beautiful. You're so beautiful You're so beautiful - Pat McGuire  Go buy the Pat McGuire CD.  Its so goddamned good youll be doing yourself a favor.
