That's all my days consist of anymore. It makes me sad. This year is not going well at all so far. At least there's no marching after school tomorrow. Seriously, I'm looking forward to it so so much. I'm looking forward to just getting to go home with my friends and chill at home for a night. If I go out, all I would really want to do would be to hang out at a friend's house. Maybe I'll invite people over here. I don't know yet. We'll see. And right now, I am just so incredibly exhausted and feeling blah that I'm going to bed.   I'll probably write more tomorrow when I have  free time. I'm really aggravated with a lot of people right now. OK, just sort of one but it's ok. Maybe I wont complain tomorrow. Maybe I'll learn how to supress my annoyance. Sleepy time now. Good night.
