((quit flattering yourself)) ((nope))  i'm going to the parade, i'm not sure with who, but it will be fun and we'll stay in the hotel tonight and go to another parade tomorow and it will be all good.  mamaw's back to her normal bitchy self, she's been yelling at me to clean stuff all morning.  lauren((lives across the street)) invited dev to stay last night and not me. it made me feel kind of bad since i was kind of standing right there and she could have as many people as she wanted.   oh well!!!
