Summer hasn't hit Bozeman with full-force, either, but we'll make do with the mid-60s.  The Boy and I are hitting the strip mall today, reliving our faux-wedded-bliss experience from Spring Break.  The Pier 1 sales girl really wanted to sell us a dining table and flatware.  Stupid bitch.    So the last exam went well.  It was easily a 3 hour exam crammed into 2 hours; actually, less because it took 30 minutes to even read the whole fact pattern.  But overall, feeling pretty damn good about the entire exam period.  Also received our Appellate Briefs at the end of the Torts exam.  Turned out to be my lowest grade of the three making up our final for the class, but ended up with an A- for the entire year.  And that makes me smile.  The evening that followed wasn't so much a huge explosion of celebration and rejoicing as it was a relieving time among friends who had all endured the same adventure.    The drive yesterday felt really good.  Always find such solace and renewal on long drives.  It's the music, the endless empty miles, the shifting landscapes and hurling oneself toward some destination as fast as possible.    And so, we come to the big dinner....  The Boy is an excellent cook, there was much rejoicing, laughter and flowing wine.  Miss Vicious lived up to the hype and husky-Jodie-Foster-only-deeper voice.  The pubescent cracking of said voice was particularly cute.  The Boy and I regaled her and friend Sally with stories of the old and not so old times.  They heard about the Day of Noodle-Making over Christmas break and laughed as hard as the Boy and I did when it happened.  At 10, we made our way out into the gritty meanstreets of Bozeman by stopping at the uber-swank wine bar, Thunk.  We probably looked like young riff-raff without any clue, but our hot waitress was hot and didn't judge us.  We giggled over the Cherry Explosion selection, wondering if it held a prophecy.  It went down entirely too smooth and too fast, and soon we found ourselves at the bar Levi's been talking about for two years, The Starling.    Not knowing what follows wine best, I let Miss Vicious buy me a beer and received a tour of the establishment with this Amazon on my arm.  Eventually, our gang found a quiet corner in which to gasp over the appearance of Daniel elsewhere in the bar.  I had yet to see the new man who had wooed the Boy and then kicked him in the gut, and we three gals counseled Levi on how to handle the situation.  Before long, Vicious set her drink down and said, "I'm going down there.  Pull some Vicious action on his ass."  And sure enough, within 10 minutes, Dan came 'round, looking to talk to the Boy he'd ignored all week.    While they went off to see if they could save whatever was growing between them, the new hero on the block and I had more than a few moments to chat.  We started with the usual:  what do you want to be when you grow up, etc., which led into some tales of personal adversity and ultimate triumph, not entirely unlike the first real conversation I had with another Libra in a coffee shop 9 months ago.  As we came around to the optimism and hope that best serves as endings to such tales, the Boy rejoined us and became the focus of our attention.  Their talk had gone well; points made, apologies given and a new start on a friendship ahead of them.  Yay.    After some piled snuggling on a tattered leather couch, we all were fading fast, as were the remnants of V's voice.  And so, we made our departures, promising to connect today and see what new adventures we could have together.    This morning's been spent in much the same way most mornings in Bozeman are: one of us wakes up first, jumps into bed with the other for an hour of dozing, snuggling and chatting.  Then we're on the couch with our breakfast and coffee for at least another hour,chatting some more, looking through new magazines, solving the world's problems, etc. before one starts morning pages or blogging, all the while planning the day as though we still have most of it at our disposal.  Finally, it dawns on us that it's almost noon and someone should get in the shower if we're going to do half of the things we've just spent all morning talking about.    And so, since he just finished with his shower, it would appear to be my turn...
