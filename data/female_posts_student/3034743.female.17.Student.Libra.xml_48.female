Oh, in case your memory has failed you, the apple is the fruit with red or yellow or green skin and sweet to tart crisp whitish flesh. Flesh...such an odd word. It reminds me of Jack Beatty, when he once said "The maritime strategy has an all but unstoppable institutional momentum behind it... that has given force and flesh to the theory." Such a wise, wise man! Alas! I am suddenly urged to share a story from the depths of my dear childhood. I was 16 years old. My how the days have grown since then! I was working on the corner (yes, the corner) of our family field. That is where the best worms were! Twas my job to scoop up the soft earth, and search for the worms! My family had acquired a taste for birds, so we needed the worms to bait them in! I however, did not care for the birds. But none of this is important to the story I want to share! So, back to where I started. I was 16 years old. I was walking my cat down the street, and as we turned the corner, we saw a little man. I decided to name this man Yenibs (pronounced "George"), so I call to him: "Yenibs, what are you doing?!" and strangley enough he didn't answer me! It angered my cat, so she began to hoot like an owl. I believe that caught the mans attention for he turned to me and said in his woman-like voice "Young girl, why are you only wearing one shoe?" and I simply replied "Because the other one is on my head!" Yenibs chuckled, and quickly walked away. I miss him. He was my friend. Poor Yenibs! Can one artificially create a banana? Note: The banana fruit is five or six inches long, and over an inch in diameter; the pulp is soft, and of a luscious taste, and is eaten either raw or cooked. Oh dear! How could I forget?!? It completely escaped me! I am unable to eat bananas! One time, as I was riding my kangaroo, I decided to eat an banana. What an awful idea! Something in the banana created a strange chemical reaction in my brain, and it caused me to dance like a ferret while singing old African songs! When I came out of my daze, I realized I was at starbucks wearing a business suit and talking about the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System) with my "friend" Henry. Henry was good looking, I suppose. Something was a little odd about him tho. Maybe it had to do with the fact that he was actually a woman, but I just thought it was funny to pretend she was a man. I'm not sure, but I'll blame it on the banana. They really mess with you! Oh dear, this has acquired much lengh! I best be ending this before they come and get me! They've been after me for awhile. I made them mad with the whole "honey-frog" thing. Did you hear that? Yeah, neither did I!
