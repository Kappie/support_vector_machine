No, that's not really it--I'd be perfectly fine with spilling all of my secrets if I knew that only perfect strangers would discover them. The problem is that my  friends  will read this. Some of the biggest things in my life right now would end up making somebody very angry.  urlLink VW  probably knows what I mean.  Oh, why can't we all just be honest? I'm sure the world would make a hell of a lot more progress--for the better or the worse--if we'd all just be brutally honest with each other. Why does life have to be this tangled web of lies? Why must we put on masks in public, while complaining and ranting behind the backs of others and secretly fuming with anger when we're alone? I hate  hiding  things.  But I can't just go right on ahead and be brutally honest in this. I'd like to, but as long as the rest of the world is caught up in secrecy and deception, I'm afraid I must follow suit.
