The plane was kinda cool, it was really small with only two rows of seats, one row had 2 seats and one row had one seat so I had my own and I liked it cause I had the window, the asle, and the middle seat all in one (for the low, low -one time- payment of $300!)! I kinda embarassed myself though cause I asked the flight attendent (who was male and named Sven... or at least that's what his name should be) for Root Beer and he said "Cold beer? How old are you?!" Really looud and everyone looked at me and I was like "No, Root Beer." and after all that trouble they didn't even have any. When I got off the plane Curt brought us to this Kosher (not Kersher) deli where Mick's family were because of this parade for the Indy 500. That was cool, met some new people, saw some old I'd met last time I was out there. It was nice to see his grandma, she's really cool, so are the aunts. So then we walked over to the Circle Center Mall (ug I think that's what it's called) and I foudn a jersey for the Pacer game the next night (more on that later). We hung out there for a bit and then went back to his house for a few hours... fast forward to dinner which was awesome. We went first to this German Beirgarten where they had loud music, drunks, and some of the best Root Beer I had ever tasted in my life. Then we walked the short distance (however in my high hells it felt like miles) to this awesome place. We ate outside and it was really nice (even though our candle kept burning out)... I had this awesome Chicken Marsala and then for desert we had this Creme Brule (sp? French students help me out) sampler thing that had raspberry, choclate, and vanilla Creme Brule it was really really good. Then we walked back to the Beirgarten and found Mick's parents and went home and lets fast fowrad again... Um... Sunday I woke up early but he woke up kinda late. We ate breakfast and Grandma stopped by. This apparently was a rare occurance but I'm sure glad she managed it cause she came bearing matching beach towels for Mick and Me of the American flag w/ a Statue of Liberty on it. She's awesome... Mick, if your reading this, your g-ma is awesome. So the game was an experiance. I bought myself a Regie Miller (#31) jersey and then we sat in some AWESOME 10th row seats right behind the Pistons (those bastards). The whole game was fun, I got on the big titon-tron thingy for a second behind some guy w/ a big afro of blue and yellow. But yeah, the Pacers lost and Mick wasn't too happy, I cheered him up thow... fast forward.... Um.. Monday... Monday... what did we do Monday... oh yeah.. Monday will have to be one big fast forward except for the basketball, the stargazing, and the movies "The Matrix: Reloaded" (only for about 20 minutes) and "Office Space"....  Monday night we were up really late and kinda camped out on the floor. At 7 he had to go to drivers ed so I got some sleep and then when he came home we were both out and then he didn't wake up till about 2:15 (my plane was leavin at 4:18). I had a good time trying to wake him up though. I kept throwin Hershey Kiss wrappers at him, it was fun.  So, as we waited for Curt and Gina to get home from where ever they were we ate some Tostitos with cheese and salsa. It was good. So we get to the airport and I thought I would be just getting to the gate on time and in my rusgh I almost didn't say bye to Curt and Gina. But when I got to the gate my plane was delayed, but not by much so I bought a salad and sat tight. Then it was delayed till 5:30 so I walked out of the gate area and met up with Mick. I got Curt and Gina, G-ma, and Mick's aunts some Gadiva's and then he got a pass to come back to the gate with me. It was then said that the plane wasn't gonna take off till about 6:30 and I called my dad and he said if it was delayed after 7 I could just get a flight the next day. But it wasn't delayed (why would it be?). I wanted to get the flight anyways cause I was freaking about the storms we would have to fly through but why would my dad understand that I didn't want to freak out when I was by myself. So, Mick and I had to say goodbye. The plane ride home was bad, I was sitting next to two pervy older men and I was just very uncomfy with the lightning comming from the clouds in the distance. So, now I'm home...  On the up side, I got my yearbook today. I can't beleive I'm an honorary senior. Crazy. x0x
