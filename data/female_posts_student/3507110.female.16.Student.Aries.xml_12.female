I'm feeling a little sick, got a tad bit of a cold, and I'm tired but I'm content and I suppose that's all that matters. Outside my neighbors and my mother and aunt are putting in fence posts for our riding arena. And so begins the Riding Season 2004! The sun is shining and the weather is finally getting better. Last night I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. You would have liked it, I know you would have. Maybe you and I will go see it soon, just you and me. I won't tell you anything except that you'll be amazed. Tonight I will be staying up later than before, though it's probably not a good idea in my condition. But school's out and it's not like I have to rest up on Sunday, right? Only 9 more days until I can hopefully speak to you again, hopefully fall into your embrace and tell that I've missed you. Well, I should really get going and see if anybody needs my help. Love you!      I think about your face and how I fall into your eyes, The outline that I trace around the one that I call mine     -Sam
