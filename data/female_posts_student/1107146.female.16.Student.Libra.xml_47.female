So I'll just wait for the winds to change.  That FUCK YOU post was really in angst against her taking it all back, that's just the lil' screaming child post coming to life. It's hard to stand strong when so many things are hitting you, like being an oak in a hurricane.  Pretending yes, as to how, I really don't know. I just like to conceal little things about myself.  And sorry to everyone for being an idiot and not calling certain persons back (you know who you are Lindsey :) ), some major stuff was up that night and I forgot about it eventually. VERY SORRY! I was kind of worried, though, as to what I would tell you anyway. So that was probably a part of it.  Gonna try and reinvite Lindsey, pick up the pieces of this BLog and all my friends and such.  Girls...  Argh.
