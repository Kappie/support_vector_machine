Feels good to do something that important all on my own. 1-774-991-1509  I took this afternoon off from work to punish my boss ... though he thinks its cause i didn't feel well, but really its because for 2 weeks now i have been slaving over a brochure for Dr Yarnall and i am working relly hard on it cause i am trying to kiss a little ass. Ken decides yesterday that he going to take a look at the files and "make a few changes" a few changes turns into he is going to do a version of his own and let yarnall choose the one he likes .... flash forward to today when yarnall comes in and ken only gives him his copy ...yarnall doesn't even know mine exists. i fucking hate that i did all that work and all he did was just move some text and cut a couple of pictures. I will be damned if that is how people in the real work operate.  Talked to mom night ... let her now i was thinking and praying for her ... she is doing ok but is getting anxious about the next surgery. I hope and pray to god everynight to ease her pain and worry. She is my inspiration though i must say, no matter what is going on with her ... she always wants to talk about me and whats up with me and rick and how are we doing .... i love her and i hope to god she is fine after this surgery ...  i need sleep ... talk to ya'll in the morning ;-)
