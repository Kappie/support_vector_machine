He's sleeping right now, as I just had to give him a bath as he'd peed all over himself. But at least he's peeing!!!   Now I need to clean the bathroom. And then take another shower. And then study.   Yeah, that whole studying thing didn't exactly happen this weekend. Pretty much the whole weekend revolved around the pet hospital, but at least Shah's alive, and he's more important than a stupid College Board test on any given day at any given time.   I'm a bit worried again, but I suppose that had to happen. It'll be almost over in two weeks and totally over in four. *Sigh*  Shah and I had a 15-minute "purr-meow" conversation. He told me everything he had to go through and cried about it, but I was glad to hear him open up.  In case you're wondering how I talk to my cat, it's simple: a bit of English, a bit of Italian, and a bit of Shahlang.  A sample conversation such as today's: Shah: "Purrrr meeeeoww mooo muurfle!!! Purr!!!" Me    : "Purr purr purr I knoow! Ti voglio bene!! Purrr purrr mooo moo purr murfle!!"  (Although today's involved no English nor Italian really, as we were at extreme conditions)  Okay, back to work now.
