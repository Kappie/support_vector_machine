Sasuke is one of my favorite characters.  I just love how stubborn and silent he is.  It's also quite funny how he reacts to certain things.  Basically what happened was that while Naruto and his team had been assigned a mission meant for young children like weeding or catching pets, there was a mixup and they were assigned with a mission meant for professional ninjas.  Sasuke gets trapped in an ice prison and Naruto comes in to help.  Despite their efforts, they are easily defeated.  Naruto gets knocked out and Sasuke is the only one left standing (Sakura is not in the ice prison, she's protecting the child and his master's target).  Haku, the genius child controlling the ice prison, sends a shower of needles to Naruto, thinking that even if Sasuke seemed to hate Naruto, he would go protect him.  Sasuke positions himself in front of Naruto and the needles penetrate his body.  Naruto wakes up and sees Sasuke.  "You did it, Sasuke!" he says but freezes and his smile disappears once he sees the fatal wounds all over his friend.  "You're always such a burden" coughs Sasuke.  The needles are poking out from Sasuke's back and blood is dripping on the floor.  "Why?" he mutters, "You protected me...  "Who knows..." Sasuke mutters while coughing up blood and remembering the times he and Naruto spent together as rivals, "I...hated you " "Why did you protect me?" yells Naruto angrily while clenching his fist tightly, " I NEVER ASKED YOU TO!". "How am i supposed to know?" whispers Sasuke, " My body moved of its own accord, stupid..." His eyes close and his body slides down to the floor.  Naruto catches him and sees Sasuke's eyes that were wide with fear and sadness.  "I didn't want to die until i killed my brother." Sasuke whispered near tears and reaching out his hand to Naruto,"I wanted to accomplish my dreams.  You... don't die."  Naruto stares in disbelief as Sasuke's hand drops to the floor, motionless.  Sasuke's stubborn eyes and features relax.  His mouth opens slightly and his head falls back.  Naruto realizes that this is the way of the ninja and that he might soon lose more friends as he grows up.  He drops Sasuke's body on the floor and cries out, "Shut up, stupid.  I...hated you too.  You will pay.  You will pay for killing my friend."  Of course, i can't tell you what happens next.  Heheh, that would ruin the story.  Watch the anime yourself.        And this is Sakura crying over Sasuke's dead body.
