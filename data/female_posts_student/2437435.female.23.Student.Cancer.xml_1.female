And I feel soaked to the skin. ~ Leonard Cohen   A California pessimist carries a card in his wallet that reads, "In case of an accident -- I'm not surprised.   A pessimist sees only the dark side of the clouds, and mopes; a philosopher sees both sides, and shrugs; an optimist doesn't see the clouds at all - he's walking on them.  ~Leonard Louis Levinson  The basis of optimism is sheer terror.  ~Oscar Wilde  an optimist is a guy that has never had much experience. ~Don Marquis, archy and mehitabel, 1927  Always borrow money from a pessimist, he doesn't expect to be paid back.  ~Author Unknown   I am sorry for all who read this, I am just in a icky kind of mood, and for those know me well, bare with me. These come and go, but they seem to come more than they go. hehehe  that's pessimistic! But yea, I am having some serious issues and stuff and I don't know what's my problem... ok, I am just going to stay away from everyone for a little while.
