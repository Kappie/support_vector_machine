Eminem and D-12's video about being the lead singer of the band is hilarious. and the ending, with the mexican salsa is even better. just another reason of why i love eminem soo much i'd better go. i have to pack, and i have to download music, and i have to take a shower, and i have to do stuff.... and work.. and stuff
