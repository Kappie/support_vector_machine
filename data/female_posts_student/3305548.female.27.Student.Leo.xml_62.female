My father-in-law has groused daily this week about there being no dessert. The fact that desserts are stacked three-fold in the refridgerator made especially for "the ladies" doesnt make it any easier to take that his wife couldnt be bothered with making or buying something sweet for him to eat this week. He seems genuinely hurt - really about as effected as he is about losing at the racetrack. Every night he has asked about the sweets, and everynight he gets the same reply, "There are ice cream bars in the freezer." The problem is that there aren't really any ice cream bars at all. There are popscicles and fudgescicles. A huge difference to a picky sweet tooth. I thought after his obvious disappointment Tuesday that my MIL would throw a tray of brownies in or something. No such luck for my FIL.   Ah, but the Ladies have a feast fit for queens coming to them. Trust me, these biddies get the royal treatment. My MIL feels she has a "reputation" and has set standards for what her coven of crones expect at these galas. And after all, the other grey-hairs host at their houses when cards are not played here. There is, I sense, an air of competition. The house has been made spotless, the matching set of card tables has appeared, my FIL's chair in the living room has been moved. Now, this I would think would be war. But, it is the usual way of things when the ladies are coming. Move over man of the house, a herd of biddies is arriving! I feel like I should set up some kind of system with doilies or something to alert the masses. "One if by land, two if by sea! The Ladies are coming, the Ladies are coming!" *starts to look for signal doilies* *remembers i have no such frou frou* *gives up on the doily effort, for now*  The most irritating aspects about all of this card-playing preparation have been two fold: 1) I have been told that I am not to stick my nose beyond the borders of the basement if I am to stay home this evening. Plus, my husband has to work tonight or else we could escape the in coming insanity of Red Hat Club trainees. 2) Perhaps most annoying is that my MIL bowls on Thursdays, she just left for the lanes. But she refused to pre-bowl or do anything else to ease her busy day or week. She has been complaining incessantly about Thursday all week. It has driven me to the ends of my wits and back again. If she's not willing to pre-bowl or cancel then she really has no right to complain that she had no time today to do anything, and that she's been cooking all week. I want to remind her that she could have bought stuff instead of making it, or have the event catered - but I know better than to say such a thing to this homemaker. She says she hass been cooking all week, but we really havent had much in the way of dinner and every time I have seen her shes cross-stitching or watching TV. Worst though is that her brand of complaining is nasal, with a touch of her native New Jersey accent. The very sound of her irritation makes me want to claw the walls down around me.  The kicker is that my in-laws are going out of town this Saturday for a week. This means that my MIL has cooked this tremendous amount of food "all week", and there will be a ton left over. And they will be gone. My FIL will likely get only one or two pieces of that chocolate cake he has been eyeing in the fridge. My husband and I will get to ravage the spoils of card table leftovers in the wake of the absent inlaws. I too have been eyeing that chocolate cake.   I am thankful they will be gone for a whole week. A week of peace. How nice that will be. No flicking of the lights on and off, beckoning us to their chores, showing us how co-dependent they have become on our existence. I think they have no clue how difficult some aspects of their life will be once we move out. Their computer or internet might hiccup and they will panic. *sigh* Of course, my MIL will not have to cook as much, which may be some relief to her. But from my understanding of this week - she doesnt like to cook, but takes alot of pride in her cooking nonetheless. She complains about the kitchen and the cooking, but wouldnt close down her home food service for anything.  In the meantime, I do my best to appreciate the mostly bland food we get served - and try not to use the pepper to viciously. She always says "try it before you spice it" and then when I do she says "what there isnt enough pepper in it for you?" A pepper catch 22. My MIL is also anti-garlic...which as made the past 3 months challenging to my pallet to say the least. I am looking forward to eating food with flavor and that hasnt been doused in margarine to boot. Perhaps her biddies think shes a good cook, but her no-fat, low-fat, substituted, flavorless food is not appealing to me. If she's that concerned about the fat and sugar content in foods, then its time to change eating expectancies and habits not substitute the flavor out of the food. I know, I shouldnt complain...its free food. And I don't complain to her. I complain here. On my anonymous little blogspace in the blogosphere.  But in other news...  Check out this link: http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3682  The link posted here attaches to an article about the effect of political blogs. While I hardly consider myself a political blog, or a pundit, not even a political idiot savant...I still think its interesting the effect of this independent publishing exercise of blogging has had on the larger industry of journalism. This is a unique little story reporting on some of the major blogs and their effects on journalism and the manner in which these blogs have flowed into the mainstream. Plus, my loyal blog readers know about my enjoyment of blogging about blogs in my blog. The nature of the catch-22/infinitous/twilight zoniness of the study keeps me looking for news about blogs. Plus, it makes me feel semi connected with the larger entity of the blogosphere. Although I have to say that I wish I knew something about HTML so that I could do something more extraordinary with my blog.  Giving me fits of laughter in print:   In top headlines today these headlines appeared next to each other:  Gay Marriage Opponents Pin Hopes on House  'Angels in America' Leads Emmy Nominations  Do the people of America need a more clear sign that their elected officials are not representing them? The Emmy's are not the bastion of culture. They are about entertainment. Only shows with decent ratings even get recognized.  Maybe our Senators and members of the house will see the sign. It's a sign that America has come a far way in homosexual equality as a culture and we dont want to take any backwards steps - even if the society at large is not yet prepared for the ultimate forward steps.   I say bring it on. I am ready. I have been ready. I will be very happy when gay marriage and gay adoption are approved and when sexual preference joins the list of protected stats such as age, race, gender...and when it makes it to the UN war crimes documentation as well. It will be a glorius day and a great step forward for the world. I know I shall live to see it, but I also know I must wait a wee bit longer.  My dizziness is starting to wear off again a bit. I am having huge troubles sleeping so that doesnt help my state much. My hubby is complaining of a sore throat and sneezing today...I am a little worried he's come down with a cold. He's in denial - wont stop at the drug store on the way home to grab anything to boot. He says that would be a sort of admission that he is sick or something, and he says that he doesnt want to give the germs something to rally around. *blink blink* Riiiight, welcome to the mind of a man who refuses to be sick.  Warning up upcoming news event: It is 29 days until the Olympics in Athens, Greece. I have to warn my blog readers that I am an Olympiholic. I love the Olympics and will likely cover the events in my blog to a certain extent. Now, most of my readers are international, believe it or not. And I am making a statement at this point in time to let you know that I will not mean to slant my coverage about the Olympics in an ethnocentric manner. The UK and Canadian teams are of interest to me in every way...in the same way that any other team or individual Olympian is fascinating. BUT I have to deal with the US Press coverage of the events, and NBC's choices of which Olympians are the one's to watch or at least who deserves the little background story videos and whatnot. SOOOOO I have to cover what I can and what I am presented with. Many events may be shown but the US press always emphasizes the US athletes unless for example there are none after eliminations. But then that event doesnt usually get much coverage. I just wanted to warn my readers, and let them know that I do not get taken over by fits of patriotism just due to 16 days of glory. I root for the underdogs, the people whose performances deserve recognition, and the athletes with the skills and luck to out perform the others. I actually hope that the US gets beat in various events. I mean, big shock, athletes with priveleges and expensive sports facilities win! I would rather the kid that practiced in rags and ran barefoot get the gold. Show the USA that it takes more than money to succeed. Right, well be forewarned I will turn into a punk version of a Bob Costas cohost in a few days. I hope that it might get you to tune into the Olympics yourself once in a while.  That's all the news in fits of print for the moment!  --Mack
