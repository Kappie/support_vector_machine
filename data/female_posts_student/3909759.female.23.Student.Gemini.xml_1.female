I was thrown back into this sentimental feeling, back when I regularly was up to mischief ... I remember Kathleen and I and our "grocery antics," my most favorite memory involving eggs and pantyhose...  I remember Erica and I screaming out the window at certain houses and leaving bizarre art projects on certain people's cars... Years ago Kathleen saw the creation of the "Enchanted Fucking Bird” and Erica witnessed the ceremony in which I gave away the "Plasticware Heart,"  and Sebastian and I welcomed "Kwafasa Zimbuki the Yard Bushman" into our lives...  Running around the other night made me miss the art of chaos, the art of mischief... I touched it again, briefly clinging to a carefree sensation that somehow reminded of summer days that passed me by in South Glastonbury...  my daily run around Matson Hill and my daily stop in the berry fields to visit Sebastian and Grub, with the sun beating down on me, the zen in the buzz of the bugs, the beads of sweat running down my back, the relief in jumping into the pools of cold water at Cotton Hollow, the relief in the endless summer days, the humid air on my skin and the contentment in listening to the thunder rumble in the distance,  like the clouds in the sky my life carries on. It reminded me of this poem I wrote when I was 18.  This is parts of it, it’s like five or six pages long. heh heh.  I loved writing the long nasty ones when I was 18.  So I’ve cut it up and these are just my favorite lines from it in an unreadable sort of way.  SOUNDS AND SMELLS I'LL DRIVE TO Summer, summer. Sweet sexy summer Letting the word roll off my tongue makes me want my tank tops and makes me want to walk to  Dustin’s house.... Summer summer satisfying summer. I went swimming down at Cotton Hollow. Every single friend I had  went swimming with me down at Cotton Hollow... During the summer I’m sure there were thunderstorms- crashbangboom and hailand tornadoes. If I could only remember them, but then I was busy with cars and frisbees, rock and roll, drugs dizziness forgetfulness, smiles sleepingdreaming, handstands... Rockandroll, crashbangboom, I made love to the summer in all my helplessness  under a fireworks-lit sky. Bitten by mosquitoes, listening to birds mocking my voice at dawn in my front lawn... In summer we became dancing tribes- passionate children,  we watched the sunset and magic rise out from our fingertips. The heavy summer air satisfied me: dreams and comets and lightning and running, movement and boiled noise. Follow my laughter into the summer: I’ll go swimming even through a billion thunderstorms. I won’t even have to wear  scarves and boots. I’ll just take a nap, a ride, a sigh I’ll listen to and smell everything I make love to.   So, I guess it was a nice run around.   Chaos stays in the blood, even if it is idle for a long time.
