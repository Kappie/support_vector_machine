I was walking down near home when I saw one of millions of no-credit "churches" that are large diffused here in brazil. One of that "no pay, no pray" (as a frined of mine uses to say). Then a scene comes up through my mind: a particular school student firearmed trespasses a church door and discharge all munition into minister´s and followers´ heads. No survivors.  Jail would be glory! I thought for a while... But I looked my side and saw my momy´s face. She´d get shocked, soteropolitan´s society idem. Aw! who cares? These folowers of shit would be clear by their lord when they show up at heaven! LOL  We stopped for a second to look at those those people inside that church. There were about a hundred people ( well , no brains, but a hundred human corpses), evryone with hands stood up, saying some things I couldnt hear at all, and a sound of that music they play on airports during the most vacuum hourlys.  Oh misery! Revolt was uprising my backbones... Give me my AK... can be an hand grenade as well... ok at least a lil knife ... dull!  After some minutes I thought: ok Voltaire was right when he said everybody is within its rights having an different oppinion about everything, and expressing themselves. However nobody is withinh its rights stealing away each other freely attitude! No way!  Allright, I forgive these lil church lured humans, but the minister wont be forgiven! this "fellow" must go to grave, as soon as I got the opportunity to externate my hate... while I cannot, I just write it down, unfortunatelly, but someday, who knows? Oh sweet noise of screams, not sweeter than wonderfull noise of my buddy AK-47´s shots.
