Just wanting to say hey to you all out there who might one day be reading this, and wanted to say that hey, I hope you might decide to stick around for all the good things I'll have for you, stuff like parties, and cookies with ice cream and cake.   Well ok, maybe no parties, cookies, ice cream or cake, but I can still bring you a look into my mind, and what goes on in the life of a suburbian 14 year old who has nothing better to do with his time than sit here and type to all the people out there who know absolutly nothing about him.   Time for a little bit about me  My names Chris, I'm 14, living in San Antonio. I go to William Howard Taft High. I have a small circle of friends, none of whom as of yet have decided to help share this blog with me. I know, I feel so sad. Anyways, I've got a girlfriend, named Kristina, who lives all the way in Sacramento, California. I know it sounds weird to have a long distance relationship like that, and that she's 17 and all, but you know what, deal with it ok?   Anyways, thats all for now, peace out yall.
