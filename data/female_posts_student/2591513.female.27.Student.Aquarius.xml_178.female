I don't know how she does it, but she is able to take my mind off of the petty things I carry and reminds me exactly of what a good friend does and that is bring laughter back.  We have so many hilarious memories together.  She is one true friend and I am so blessed to have found her.  Seriously, who waits in the waiting room all day to see their friend's daughter born (the wee hours of her birthday mind you) and then leaves briefly so that her husband could get ready for work...only to find out that the baby was born soon after.  LOL  There is a reason why Nalani was born on her birthday.  I am super convinced of that.  Ironically our daughters, though the 9 month difference (although you would think her daughter was 9 months older than mine) get along extremely well.  They only got to hang out for a few days, but it seems that the "cousins" will be great friends for a very long time.  Heidi and I were talking about our daughters and the trouble they would cause together.  I told her that they would run up some mighty big phone bills.  I don't think it would bother me too much though because Heidi and her family are our family.  They are extremely genuine people who have always embraced us as family.  Anyway, Heidi and I were talking about the future trips to Florida that we are planning.  Ed and I invested in the Disney timeshare.  Yes Ed and I are Disney fanatics.  I will fully admit to that.  So after our nice trip to Florida next Christmas we plan on going on a nice DISNEY cruise....because if my calculations are correct, that is when they are due for another DISNEY cruise...2006, right?  Okay, well I think I am just about done.  I was just excited about the converstaion.  THANKS HEIDI, I would be lost without you!  Damn, too bad you live all the way in NJ!
