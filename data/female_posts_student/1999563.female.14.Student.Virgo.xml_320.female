But they werenb't going ot leave until 6:30 so I was like AH! I am going to be in the very back of the chrystal.  So we left and didn't get there till like 7:10. So I was like AH! I can't wait itll I get my lisence. Then I iwll show up 4 hours early for EVERY concert. Grr face. Oh well. So we entered the building. I didn't realize how yucky the chrystal is for concerts. Sure, the floor MAY have springs in it (that Jon wants to do backflips on ;) more about that later..) But, you cant have a good veiw of the stage unless your in the very front row. Karsen, kasey, Sara and I got fairly close to the front btu then Karsen was like "I am tooooooo hot" We we left :( Copeland started to play. Oh my goodness. That lead singer is creeptastic. I took mandy pictures of him JUST FOR YOU MANDY!!  ;)  Then the jealous sound (was that there name? *can't remmeber*) Lead singer: Mandy he is BALD haha. Not atractive. They were okay. Nothing really memorable about them.  Then Swtichfoot Right b4 switchfoot I ditched our group because they were in the back and I got about 5 feet from the stage sdo I was like "Yay!" Switcfhoot was so good! Yeah, I love them.:) It was the drummers birthday so they brought out a birthday cake and ballons and we all sang happy birthday. It was sue-wheat. :) Umm...Switchfoot didn't do anything REALLY memorable. But yeah. It was grand.  I took video with my digital camera. Haha. I was brekaing the rullees. Mwa haha.  After switchfoot our group was like WE HAVE TO GO! So I didn't get to even get a s-foot sticker :( I was so sad. And, switchfoot was going to be out there to chat after a bit. *can't wait till she gets lisence* I am going to bo at the concerts 4 hours early and stay 4 hours late.  I think I will write more when I get back from school.. :)
