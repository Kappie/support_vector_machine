Before I had a boyfriend I thought to myself....why don't I have a boyfriend I know how to love afterall I have the greatest teacher of love in my life--Jesus. I would think to myself that I would be the best girlfriend. But then I get a boyfriend and I feel like an infant stumbling to walk. Many bruises, many scrapes. I am left with the discovery that this is one area that I just don't know crap about. I guess you don't really discover how totally selfish you can be unitl you are knee deep in trying to love someone and be loved by them. I just wish there was a button to push that would automatically assert God's ability to love unselfishly onto me. So what is something that you thought you had figured out but realized you didn't. Any thoughts on love?
