Little did I know, there would be a massive traffic accident in Whitney, pop. 2000, involving a combine and several other vehicles.  Traffic was backed up for miles, with no verifiable information on what was going on.  I mean, it's Whitney, it's not like Zack and Jim are updating the traffic every 15 minutes on alternate routes for Farm to Market Road 933.    Lest you think I am a completely heinous bitch, I did sit in silence for several minutes out of respect and concern for anyone who might be injured up ahead.  But after a while I was unable to contain my irritation with being passed on the shoulder almost constantly while patiently waiting my turn to go through the scene of the accident.  I pulled over, passed several people on the shoulder, and joined the alternate-route seekers in what quickly became a very bad idea.    There aren't really any alternate routes through Whitney, and I know about zero of them.  Luckily for me, two helpful gentlemen had come off of their porch to guide the out-of-towners back to the highway.  They could have been brothers, or cousins, or maybe each other's uncle, I'm really not sure.  They shared the same haircut--shaved on top with a six-inch tail in the back, sticking out of a trucker cap--and the same penchant for giving directions.  It went something like this:  Uncle/Dad: "You gotta go back this way, see, then turn around, and, uh, and go that way, and then you'll turn, um, yeah, turn and go over there, uh-huh, go over, uh, thataway and then you'll get back on the highway."  Dad/Uncle: "No, stupid, you gotta tell her which *way* to turn.  See, ma'am, you go this way (undistinguishable hand motion) and then go, uhhh, ummm, right, then go over here (another ambiguous gesture) then turn around and, that'll put you back on the highway."  Me:  "Oh, okay."    I decided to go with my handy built-in compass and just travel in the general direction of Waco, which actually got me to the highway fairly quickly.   You know how once your frustration stores have been tapped, everything else that annoyed you that day comes rushing back?  Well, it happens to me.  So while I was driving around lost in Whitney, I had a chance to ruminate on various things that caused my blood pressure to rise today.    1.  If I hear one more country song telling me I'm not a good American because I don't think our presence in Iraq is justified, I'm going to swear off country music forever.  2.  I can't stand that new rock song about "I found a reason for me...and it's you."  Get a life, dude.  This really wouldn't bother me so much if it wasn't simultaneously on three out of the six radio stations that I can get en route to work and back.  And two of the others are playing Manichean country ballads.  3.  A rather overweight co-worker informed me this morning that the fat-free, 80-calorie smoothie I was having was "full of carbs" and therefore "would just turn right into fat."  Now, I'm not Kate Moss's body double, but neither am I facing knee surgery in the upcoming months due to the strain of carting my oversized body around.  The moral here is those who live in fat houses should not throw diet advice.    4.  That was mean.  Lord, I apologize.  5.  Actually, I might be a little sensitive about the weight thing because this morning I hopped onto Coby's fancy digital scale, and all it said was "L".  What does that mean?  Lardass?  Lightweight?  I need more specificity from my scales, dammit.  After re-reading this post, it's probably a good thing we moved Wine Tasting Wednesday up to Tuesdays.  I'm going to need it this week.
