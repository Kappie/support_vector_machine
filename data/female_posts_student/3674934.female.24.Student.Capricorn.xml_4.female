A few nights before this I dreamt I was pregnant - which is literally impossible at this point in time. I got told today that it doesnt really have anything to do with pregnancy as such - just maybe new beginnings. Incredibly weird dreams - I think I may be stressed or something...Nah! So the exam went well - or as well as it could considering there were about 2 or 3 questions worth about 20 marks altogether that I had absolutely no idea what the answers were - DAMN you tennis theory! SO I made shit up - it was quite fun actually. I like exams - well sorta - I dont get as stressed as most people because I'm a veteran now - done a fair few anyway. Today I get to dress up as Jake Blues from the Blues Brothers - its great when you dont have to be yourself! Dressing up rocks! If only I could get away with it in every day life. Singing is another thing I love - if only I could sing better my dreams of being a pop star could become reality! I've decided that this blog thing is really cool - cos I've always wanted to write and a few years ago the chronicles of my life would have been very interesting - lots of drama but now alas it is all fairly boring what with study and practically married life - it does get a bit dull... However I am not complaining one bit because the days of yesteryear were full of quite a lot of angst and well who REALLY wants angst I ask you?   Share house living is a thing I've done for 5 years now - I've moved 5 times also. Not that long ago I was seriously considering moving out and living on my own - but things changed I got hard and told the one person in the house that they needed to pull their socks up! Well it got better and she kind of pulled her socks up but the socks are kind of drooping now down towards the ankles so to speak. I have a tolerance level that seems to get higher and higher until a point every 3 months or so when I reach boiling point and want to kill everyone - even the nice people who do stuff! Argh~ At the moment its in the mid range so its all ok - every one can relax! I don't however actually think I could live by myself as I would scare too easily - coming home to an empty unit at night        would not be all that fun - my active imagination (which by the way only seems to think of bad bad things - like after I have held my little baby cousins or something I have scary dreams about dropping them or tripping over and landing on them) would work overtime - I'm not really scared of the dark but if its dark sometimes I go outside to go downstairs and there's no light switch til I actually reach the bottom - my brain goes crazy - my heart beats faster and I get scared that someone anyone could be down there. This could have something to do with the HUGE block of flats we live next to with a whole bunch of hmmm colourful sorts living there. One time I could hear a guy crying out for help and well I went outside and it seriously sounded like it was coming from beneath ouur verandah - so of course I ran back inside - turns out that he was next door onthe 3rd story - hed somehow broken his leg trying to climb into his window! And his cries were so loud that they carried all the way to my ears! Another time a crazy lady threw herself onto the bonnet of my flatmates car as she was going out the driveway - she was screaming HELP ME HELP ME HE'S GOING TO KILL ME!! I could hear the screaming from inside the house and ran up the driveway to find a whole bunch of people trying to calm this chick down - turns out that both the guy and the girl had met each other at a mental institution - Oh what a love story! Anyway - I dont want to live in those flats surrounded by a bunch crazies or worse scaries!
