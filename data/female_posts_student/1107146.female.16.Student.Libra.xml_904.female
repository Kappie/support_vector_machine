I really didn't mean to type "behaviour" like I did, it just sort of came out and I kept it. I think I'll do that with all the cool words as such. Like...um. "Saviour" and "behaviour" and um...well. Fucke mee, Ie don'te knowe anye moree. At least at the moment. I'm sort'o'tee-red (read: tired). I just ate din-din. This is the first time I actually got to the computer in the last three or so days! YES! Or two, I'm not very sure. I don't think it really matters.   Sir William, I hope you're doing ok. It really sucks about your aunt. I wish I could do more for you, but 1) I really wouldn't know what to do, 2) you might not need it, and 3) I'm still a suicide kid. I probably shouldn't be cutting back on sociality this much (i.e.: just Linds :) but it's all good, thou'rt good company Miss Lindsey of Reid) but eh. I should really do what I feel like for a while. Hmm. That sounds really assholeish. I don't know, it's sort of against my nature to not want to help everyone. I guess it's a problem in itself. Well, that's not entirely true. Nobody really ever weighted me down with everything they got hit with. At least, consciously it didn't. What am I saying?! It's madness! I think it's time to go to bed. Har har.  Peace, my rockers.
