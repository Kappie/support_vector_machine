Sometime I ask myself, "Why doesnt the world understand me?".  Most of the time I would tell myself, "Never listen if I choose not to. Never care for what people say. Just live my life to the fullest".   I am known for being a party girl. I party just to have fun and not worry about anything. One thing I dont do is Sleeping around unless I have feelings for that person. But that doesnt happen very often, I'm just too picky with who I sleep with. (Hey, there is nothing wrong with that!!!).   I love being stress free and I truly love my freedom. I've grown into a young blossom whom I dont think anyone can have. At the same time I feel lost, full of loneliness and I often get emotional from time to time. I'm getting sick and tired of being alone!!!  I want someone to comfort me with an open arm and who would make me smiles at all time. Dont you understand??? I want a man who can be a real man, not a mama's lil boy.
