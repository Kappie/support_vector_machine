I left the http:// part out of the URL and when you do that, most browsers  have a tendency to append the URL to the existing page's URL.  I just hadn't noticed it because XP is super-smart.  LOL!  It would work anyway -- because it could probably tell that I'm a dumbass.  LOL!  Anyway, it's fixed now.
