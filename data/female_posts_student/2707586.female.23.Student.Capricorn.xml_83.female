I mean really, if we can find the time to write a little something now and then, I think that they should be able to take time out of their "busy" schedules and write a sentence or two. I mean Adam rarely goes to class so why can't he write when he is supposed to be there. All John does is play on computers all day, so no problem there. Brendan thinks he is busy with his Masters but hey, so am I. Sean I will give a break. Being a marine can be a tough job. Really I see no reason why those slackers can't write once in a while. So if you are one of the previously noted slackers and you are reading this,  write in your own blog !!! Kudos to my girls for keeping with it!
