Today Jenn was being very sexual, more than I have ever seen her get. lolz. It was hill-jarious! First off I went to the fridge to see if we had any meat to eat because I need to loose some weight and I want to diet. lolz....Yea, so anyways I was like "We need more meat" And then Jenn said something....I don't quite remember but she said it in a way that made it seem like she was talking about penises. She was like....You can get some bigmeat or something like that and I started laughing so hard. And then we started painting these wood blocks we pre-drilled holes and my job was to take the dowels (skinny sticks) and put them trough the hole so the wood could dry. Well after she finished painting them I tried to put the dowels in the hole and I missed and I had to try for like a while...and she said "That's why you're not a boy" LOLZ... I was crackin' up so bad.   I had a Burger King Chicken Ceasar Salad....It was gooood and diet friendly.   P.S. Take me out to Raging Waters or Six Flags Or the beach..I love you! lol...I'll give you a cookie
