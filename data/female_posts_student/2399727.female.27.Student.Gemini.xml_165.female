While I'm waiting for news, I'm going to work on some paperwork I didn't do yesterday thanks to that never-ending migraine.  The bad weather passed through last night so it should be clear sailing for a while now.  Nice dinner at  urlLink Boston Pizza  last night.  They have a great variety of dinners on their menus - not just pizza - so it was a nice treat for a pre-Mother's Day dinner out.  Never heard back from D. or K.  :(   Not quite sure how to explain the second one, but Mind over Mood would say not to explain it.  That would be mind-reading.  More to come...
