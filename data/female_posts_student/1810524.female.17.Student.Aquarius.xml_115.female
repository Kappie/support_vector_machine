When you walk through a storm Keep your chin up high And don't be afraid of the dark. At he end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song of a lark.  Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain, Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown.Walk on, walk on With hope in your heart And you'll never walk alone, You'll never walk alone  you'll never walk alone from carousel, martin jsut randomly sent it 2 me..mayb coz my name shows some of my dispair n giving-upness...   but sometimes being alone with my heart i feel even more alone than i should! not from lack of people loving me i dont think, but i think from lack of direction! i mean i dont know where im goin with my life or what i want! i mean i hav many amazinly great people i can b with that i lv, but yet i cant help but feel emptly! like a part of me's missin! itmight just b coz im missin ppl! i mean simon n pete r on holiday, sam's like dissownin himself from me n pushin himself further away which i supose its gd if im gonna get with simon n move on...but im still lackin in something! n i really really need a tim hug! i think i m missin him altho ive neva met him! n i need lotsa hugs! n no ones here 2 hug me! mayb thats y im down coz i feel alone.....n i cant 'walk on' n open my heart coz if i open my heart it will just get hurt again! n now im not making any sence and im gettin way way 2 emotional! *drys eyes!* when in doubt blame hormones! :| *blushes!* i think im gonna go snuggle up with my snowey n mayb watch sum ally mcbeal! *comfortyness!*  Vx
