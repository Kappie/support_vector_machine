I love his poetry :) (btw that was HUGE hint) - oh and - Disclaimer: This is not my poetry blah blah you get the idea...    Grief	   When the call comes you’ll know it by the whitening face, the random weirdness of the time, or the clutch of your own heart in the dark.  When the call comes expect no politeness,  or discreetness or correctness,  though there is a pattern to them. Those calls pronounce a sudden change of fortune, by their nature, unexpected, like unannounced trains sliding solid into view  where before there was space, or the unprophecised eclipse  that darkens it all.   These are the late night calls, the pulse quickening jangle half memory, half sleep the dread; now anything is possible, now is my grip less firm on the world. Between the over loud ringing and the voice there is all possibility; you fortify yourself. All I care about, you claim, is safe within these four walls, you are renouncing friendships  and attachments  even as the sound gushes around you,  reclaiming that given part of you,  washing your hands of life-long friends.  When the call comes you can’t avoid it  or postpone it  or defend it,  the world enters, uninvited,  and won’t go away.  This shapes character, becomes more common, hardens us, makes us fallible and human the sound of the phone fills the night,  a call from beyond the daylight world  beyond fear and life.  You can make coffee, make plans revise yourself, another broken promise, rationalise it all you like. Later the sun comes up.   I love this poem. Homework to do...
