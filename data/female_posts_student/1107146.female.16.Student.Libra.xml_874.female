It's one more reason to quit that shit, or splinter with JH, Andy, and Romeo, and start a hardcore/thrash/ska band. Either that, or go straight up hardcore with Palmer and just forget this. If only I could actually write hardcore. Shit.  Anyway, I'm so tired I could cry. They put me on Lexapro today, I really hope this shit works, because elsewise I'm going to probably die of fatigue or irritability at shit not working the way it's supposed to. I need a fucking vacation. AAAUGGGHH (brains hit the floor)  *whimper* Sleep. Fuck Bayrd. I'll worry about it tomorrow.
