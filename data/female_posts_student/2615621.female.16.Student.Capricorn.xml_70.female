She was telling her all about her and andrew and she hardly even tells me that stuff, probably cuz half of the shit she says is made up in her little head. She then said lauren (yeah u) was pissed off at her for going after Will. Now...lets see...if i was lauren i would be pissed cuz lauren had this major crush on will..but then again, will was an ass to lauren, and the last thing i would want is my friend going after an ex-major-crush/asshole. lol thats confusing, but im sure lauren understands. and maybe lauren doesnt even care, but what gives katie the right to tell danielle (ugh i hate her) that lauren is pissed and make it sound like lauren is the bad guy?! lol oh well...katie told me she saw a hot guy working at lowes foods and how she knocked over a display and he helped her pick it up and they "flirted" and she went on to tell me how shes going to make will take her to lowes so she can flirt with the lowes boy in front of willbo...how...WEIRD. Katie needs a life.   I had the coolest dream ever: Lauren was off at NCSSM and called me up and begged me to come spend the weekend with her. So i packed a bag, grabbed my purse and drove out to see her. When i got there we hung out and she showed me around and let me meet all her friends. What happened next...is whoa. haha She introduces me to this HOT GUY i mean...hes like kinda punkish...kinda artsy. HE WAS HOT. and well...lauren was totally dating his TWIN bro (how weird) but we all got drunk and lauren and i got laid. HAHAHA ok...how missed up is THAT?! haha it was a good dream though ;)   Today me, ben, and chris were sitting around talkin and ben was telling me once more how his 18th bday is sunday and i was like..yeah yea yea i know. he then asked me if i was getting him a bday present and i just smiled and gave him this look like "of course...but u know its nothing u can buy..." haha a perverted kinda twist to a bday, just being goofy of course. He then told me about this cd he wanted and i pretended to be intrested and he said...no i dont want that cd from you...i want head. and that got my attention so i said "what?!" and he said...yeah, i want you to gimme head for my bday! haha and i said..oh ok ben, sure. and he was like OMG ARE YOU SERIOUS?! and of course i had to get my kicks so i said "yeah.." haha he then grabbed my arm and started pushing me between his legs and i laughed and said not here ben! and he just looked at me and said "ammatures" haha whatever. well, hes right. haha but so what. Would i give ben head...idk but hes cute...haha LMAO shhhh   Today katie and i were talkin about what all we had done as far as drinking and smoking, ect. Well we both have smoked and gotten a little tipsy and catherine wood overhead and about DIED. she said she had no idea our grade was so "corrupt" omg...lol hello. she said she wasnt sheltered but had no idea people in our "clique" OMG WHAT CLIQUE-SHES NOT IN IT were like that. umm...catherine we'd all have to be drunk to hang out with you dear. Thinkin about getting drunk, this weekend this freshman Allyson, i was on the soccer team with her, invited me to spend the night with her at her dads with these like 18-20yr old guys and get totally smashed. I said...."sure" haha i know its stupid, but all reality, i really dount we'll keep our plans and you know i wont be stupid...lol but when oppurtunies come around you gotta take them. :D haha hopefully i wont wake up with some weird freak by me...haha im just kiddin. im not stupid and we prob wont even get together.
