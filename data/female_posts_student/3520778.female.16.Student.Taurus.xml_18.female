I always used to hate this verse.  Mostly because I didn't know how to do that.  To be happy when I'm going through something that tears me apart.  And I mean truely happy.  I could fake it and answer my friends' questions with 'I'm fine' or be sarcastic and pretend to be happy...neither of these I'm sure is what it means.  Or what God wants us to do.  Wants me to do.    People say that God fills you with his love and it'll make you joyful...but is it wrong for me to say that it doesn't do that for me?  Maybe I'm not allowing for him to fill me with joy when I'm going through something hard.   But the thing is...I don't know how to let God do that...  Man, I need therapy or something.
