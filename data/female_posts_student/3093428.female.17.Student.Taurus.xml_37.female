Seriously, if you don't get seriously serious, I will seriously kick the serious into your unserious asses!  But on a totally unserious note, I have this totally paradoxialseriosity blogsite called  urlLink  ranDOMinion . If you're clever, you'll find a seriously PHun gimick in the name. Go to  urlLink  ranDOMinion , leave comments, make fun of things or serious people, then come back and do it again (when there new posts, seriously sillies!).  I just wanted to seriously show Matt how dubiously unserious the matter of adding people to the blogger is. I will come back and write here at serious random intervals, as I am quite random at best when it comes to serious matters.   Peace! >  BTW: Sunday night at youth...I have a suprise for some people! Some people could be anyone, because there is no one in particular that is picked ahead, IT COULD BE YOU!  BTW2: Have serious PHun by using html code in your blog post! Simply use the tags, and none of the "overall" codes (ie: html, head, etc). See, how I hyperlinked the url to my blogsite? Moy phun-o!
