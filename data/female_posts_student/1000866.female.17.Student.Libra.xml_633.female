Like, it was kind of there for a while and then last night I just couldn't stop coughing and I had this pounding headache and ah, I feel so crappy. I slept for a long long time though. Thank you Benodryl. I feel a little better than before but, by no means great. I'm going to go lie down for a little bit more.
