And now it’s only Wednesday – only half over! *sigh*  I hope I’ll make it through.  It’s been a really easy week, though... haven’t had much homework.  Of course it’s always nice to have a class like BCIS that I can do a lot of my homework in.  This weekend should be exciting... lots of stuff going on and already planned, which is extremely abnormal for us.    I’ve come to the conclusion that we take too many things for granted, such as our bodily functions.  Can you imagine what it would be like if we couldn’t pee?  Or poop for that matter?  It would all build up inside of us and eventually we’d have to pop and it would go everywhere and it would be gross.  I think it would leak out of our ears but some people think that due to the location of the bladder in relation to the head, that would be close to impossible.  But I dunno... if your body was full to the brim with waste, it’d probably come out in more than one area (assuming your bladder just EXPLODED and your body was literally full to the brim with waste).  Hmm, so yeah.  See what happens when people leave me by myself??  I’m gonna go crazy one day.  Did you know that my name backwards, although it’s spelled differently, sounds a lot like “asylum”?!  Coincidence?  I think not.  Actually, when I was little, I watched a lot of cheap made-for-TV movies with schizophrenic women (Lifetime, baby) and I used to be afraid that I would go crazy one day and I wouldn’t be able to prevent it.  Anything is possible!  Well, I think that’s enough for one night.  Maybe I’ll have some more insightful thoughts for you tomorrow.  Or maybe I’ll spare you, instead.  Cool song alert! Duncan Sheikh – “Barely Breathing”  ... an oldie, but one of my favorites, so therefore, you must check it out because... umm... I said so!  Farewell everyone!
