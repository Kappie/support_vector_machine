I mean I know some things that I definatly want in life but I can't have like half of them. I guess I'll just take one thing at a time. I'm just so confused on so many situations right now. and half of them I wish I would have never gotten myself into.... why can't things be as simple as they are in fairy tales? They make life seem so fun adn easy to deal with and the girl always gets the guy of her dreams at the end and they live hapily ever after....I guess if life were like that it would be too easy..I don't know but I just want to say thank you to soo many of my good friends who have been there for me, You know who you are but I want to recognize you anyways.....Jenni Lynn, you are so awesome! No matter what comes into your life I am always here for you no matter what time call me whenever you need someone. I'm always here for you....Colby, wow where to start..gah you've always been there for me whenever U just had to get things out and I've told you so many things you prob. didn't wanna know aha and I know that I've let you down sometimes adn I'm so sry about that but I want you to know that I love you so much! Don't ever change....Brittany, we've SO had our ups and downs and lately you and I haven't talked like at all and I don't know what your deal is I mean I call you and you're always pissed off, I'm always here for you and you CAN talk to me, I've just been kinda worried about you lately and really want to talk to you so please if you read this then call me I love you like you were my sister,not that,even closer I really care about you and don't want you to get hurt....Adam!!! Gah, You are sooooooo awesome!! I don't knwo how to thank you enough...we've had so much fun ever since we met! aha you didn't knwo what you were getting yourself into once you asked me to come mudriding that time! aha that's great!........

Turn to God in all your doubts and he will make you stronger!!
