Did I say that someone stole my bike over the weeekend of the 4th.... that sort of sucks, but I guess it will be one less thing to have to move. The boy was a real pain this morning and has skipped camp once again to come to school with me. He seems to love micro lecture... tho he hates waiting me to finish labs. LOL! I am very slow and methodical in there so as not to infect my self or others... some of that shit is not good... and frightening to look at under the scope.... but cool as hell! So tonites agenda is to cook dinner, do laundry, talk to my bf as he is back home right now and wont be back till fall... which really kind of sucks. we do have the perfect set up tho... we actually have our own lives and space, with time to miss eachother enuf to have ... well never mind that. We have time to miss eachother.  I need to run as well. You know I am not sure if anyone actually reads these or not. I do some, but not all.... yikes thats a lot of time online I'd say. I have people I chat with and all, but I get sick of it and feel a bit trapped by my comp. Does anyone else feel that way? I feel that way about people too on occassion, but not nearly as often or intensely. So I think my good friend Liz feels left out of my life and I hope that it isnt the case, but with three kids and a boy friend it makes finding time for her and I very difficult. On top of the fact that I have no money... being a student and all. So going out isn't too easy. You ask... well what about the dad???? LMFAO!! You see when I said I didnt want to try to get back together he didn't handle that all too well so he headed like 3 states away, won't take a parenting class (req. by state for divorce) and sends no money for his kids...and is actually in violation of the min. support order. The state has paid the min. to me since March. Wanna know how much? $75.00 a week. You would think he could get off his ass and give a shit to pay that little bit! Of course now the state is tracking him down to go to court and he thinks I am after him....LOL! Doesn't he realize that when I knew we couldn't get back together that I had already given up on him??? I just dont have the time or energy to deal with him any longer. Also, they dont have to learn some very disappointing habits and that is worth a lot. Ok so I am now finished on the soap box. Maybe I can just move on now. I think it is bothering me because the court date is the 15th and I have to go again and that means time from class. GGRRRRRR!!!!! So me and Lucas.. well lets say we are both at our peaks and some people are a bit shocked to meet a couple like Demi and Ashton. HA! Lucas is pretty good with my kids especially for someone as young as he is and yes he is of age... HAHAHA! Very responsible too, I think he is a decent role model for my kids at this juncture in our lives. He is so sweet to all of us. Boy the storm yesterday evening was pretty awesome and a freind sent me a cool pick of a rainbow just after. I will put it up soon, but I am not on the home comp so it wont do much good to try now. I watched the Butterfly Effect, decent movie actually, I liked it and so did my son. Speaking of which, are all boys the perverbial "mama's boys", because Josh worries me at times. I hope he grows out of it tho so he can get thru life without me always picking up the pcs. Well those seem to be all the thoughts rambling around in my head today so later!
