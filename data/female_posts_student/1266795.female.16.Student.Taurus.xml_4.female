Apparently, he's been in the hospital for the last week and his liver failed. To be honest, it doesn't seem real. I am really wishing that someone is going to call back and say "just joking" although I know that would never happen.   Currently I am at Sarah's house. She didn't want me to be alone, especially when I called her in   tears   after I got off the phone with him. So yeah. I'm just eh. So yeah, I just I'd write abiut this so that all of you know. (Aching Sushi and Compendium people.)   Quote: In honor of Ray, a child at heart, "Tu parles comme les grandes personnes!" I'm gonna miss him so much!!!!  So also in honor of Ray, who would always stand in the backyard, and yell after his dog, Shleby:  "Shelby! Don't make me come after you in my scoobey doos!" (He had scoobey doo boxers.)
