He didn't get off of work until 10:45, he was planning on sleeping over at a friend's house.  He called to say goodnite to the kids and Nalani asked him to come home.  So he rested a little and then took off and came home around 12:45A.  Only to have to wake up at 7 and drive back to work.  These are the days I wish the military would pay over time.  Poor guy.   When things are like this I feel bad for him.  I really do.  I can see him getting worn out.  That is when his temper flares.  He is just a tired man.  I know that he is also feeling the anxiety of leaving.  I feel ad for him for having to leave the kids at such a young age.  Emily is the age Bailey was when he left for his first deployment, so he misses this stage with Emily...and well he missed Emily's birth.  You can bitch all you want but the bottom line is this is his career and well we are almost half way done.  It would be stupid to throw it all away after sacrificing this much already, you know?  Well I have been hit with anxiety lately.  I know because I haven't been able to sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning.  I need to get more sleep because the school year is almost starting for me.  I don't know....maybe when school does start things will go back to being semi-normal.  I got an e-mail from and old high school friend, Josh.  It was so nice to hear from him.  I think that there is always going to be a part of me that will remember how much my friends got me through.  I didn't have the greatest childhood and it wasn't in no way because of something my parents did, maybe more along the lines of what they didn't do, but they loved us.  Sometimes bad things happen to good people.  Anyway, I don't want to relive that part of my life.  I don't want to be a bitter person again.  I left that behind and it should stay there.  I am just grateful to the wonderful people who got me through the darkness.  I might not be here today.
