Noelle drove into the wrong lane (she was trying for the left turn lane) and she ended up heading for a head on collision with a bus. The bus was like a quarter of a mile away, which made it even more hilarious. She tries to like pull over and get out of the way and the bus driver is looking at us like "DUMBASS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?" I was like trying not to laugh because Noelle was so unbelievably embarrassed. And then she had to drive over the median to get out of the way and I just lost it. I died laughing. Seriously, if I had had more to drink today I would have pissed myself. It was insane. I laughed so hard. I couldn't talk for like five minutes straight. Hahahahahahahahahahhaha. oh god... What makes it even funnier is that we were in no immediate harm. Like she just looked really stupid. The closest thing to harm we were in was the yellow cheese bus coming at us at like 15 miles an hour. Hahahaha. Oh my god. That made my YEAR.
