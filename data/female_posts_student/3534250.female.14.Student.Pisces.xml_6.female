But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows” [Matthew 10:29-31]  Have you face discouragement lately?  For those of you who are studying, maybe you have studied hard but did not get the results you expected.  Instead, you may have failed some papers along the way.  Or, for those who are working, you may feel dejected that there seems to be reward in your career although you have worked very hard in your job.  Or you realized that your name is the next on the retrenchment list.  Or, for perhaps you have faced discouragement in your relationship with others.  Or it could be of any reasons, that this week, you faced discouragement that no one seems to understand.  The burden on your shoulders is too heavy for you to bear.  You felt like giving everything up, and wondered why life is such a discouragement.  Do not despair, my friends. Our Lord Jesus Christ must have felt totally discouraged too.  Imagine spending three to four years training up the twelve, and one of them betrayed Him.  Not only day, when Christ was put into the hands of the religious leaders, all the rest of the disciples fled from Him.  Can you understand the disappointment faced by our Lord?  Yet, our Lord knows how to face up to such severe situation.  He knew how to draw strength from the Lord.  In the garden of Gethsemane, He prayed for the strength to go through the most severe trials in His human body.  The Bible says, “And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him” (Luke 22:43).  Even as our Lord needs strengthening from an angel, more so for us that we may learn to find encouragement in the Lord for our discouragement. David knew this divine principle very well.  After all, who is more persecuted than him, under the hands of King Saul?  A major part of his life was fleeing from the hands of King Saul, who desired his death.  Because of that, David fled even into the parts of the territories of the enemies, the Philistine.  He and his men also had to humble themselves as subjects to Achish, one of the Philistine princes.  When called to fight against his own people, David and his men raided the Amalekites instead in the pretext of fighting against the Israelites.  When David and his men left Ziklag, their place of abode in the Philistine territories, to join the Philistine’s armies, the Amalekites took revenge and sacked the city and captured away all the women and children and burned the city with fire.  David and his men wept and mourned, until, as the Bible says, “until they had no more power to weep” (1Sam 30:4).  The Bible further stresses, “And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters” (1Sam 30:6).  What should David, the leader of the people do in such a discouraging situation?  He had not only lost his family to the enemies, but his loyal men wanted to stone him for their own losses too.  Only in such a dim and grave situation, the faith of the one who was called “a man after mine [God’s] own heart” shone brightest.  The Bible describes for us what David did, “but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God” (1Sam 30:6). How should you encourage yourself in the Lord in times of discouragement?  Firstly, understand that discouragement is part and parcel of our walk with God.  Nothing happens by chance but by the providence of God.  It is God’s loving care and grace that will be able to sustain us in our discouragement.  Does not the Lord promise, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows” (Matt 10:29-31)?  If the Lord even bothers about the “cheap” sparrows, will He not be more concern for us in our situation?  Let us learn to uphold the promise that God cares for us as our encouragement. Secondly, learn to see the higher hand of God in your life.  The Bible say, “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose” (Rom 8:28).  We must know that God always has a higher purpose for us.  However, this in itself is not good enough.  We also need to learn to submit ourselves to the higher purpose of God.  Many Christians understand that God has a purpose for all things in accordance to Romans 8:28.  But what they lacked is a submission to this purpose of God.  They find no encouragement because they fail in surrendering their will in submission to the Almighty.  The patriarch Joseph understood this divine principle.  When he was betrayed and sold by his own brethren as a slave unto the Egyptians, he could see the higher purpose of God and learnt to submit to it.  He did not put the blame on his brethren.  Instead he testified, “But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive” (Gen 50:20)? Finally, learn to strengthen yourself with the presence of God.  Know that we are not alone as we walk the long and dusty road.  Although our friends are not with us, and nobody seems to understand or care, but be sure of this, God’s presence is constantly abiding with us.  He has promised to all those who loved Him, “Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness” (Isa 41:10).  God’s presence is the best present.  With Him, all things are possible.  My friends, be encouraged!  God is with us.  May the lyrics of this song uplift the hearts of those who are weary and who are discouraged: Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely? And long for heav’n and home? When Jesus is my portion, My constant Friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free For His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
