[i'm also nervous. sort of. i have a lot of new responsibilities. and i don't want to screw anything up. this is a big event. a big deal. there are a lot of people that attend. a lot of people have to pick up their tickets at will call. a lot is depending on me. plus we have to finish constructing the damn building before we open it. haha. oh well. i'm sure it'll all go just fine. it seems to do that every year. plus i have a good partner to co-manage the place. and i have some good folks working for me. and my boss is a good guy too. so there you go. surrounded.]  but. back to the story about my weekend. i went to a fundraiser with Frog after the meetings all day. i was kind of apprehensive about it since i was pretty tired from sitting around talking and writing shit down all day. but we went and had a great time. they played heaps of 80's music. it was in a building that was a porn studio. which makes for an interesting atmosphere. the biggest room was done up like a medieval dungeon complete with fake wooden stairs going up to nowhere. it had this funny 80's high school dance theme.. there was a girl Frog knew dressed up like  urlLink   Molly Ringwald    in    urlLink   The Breakfast Club   .. she looked great.. and had the dancing down too.. everything was done by donation only and it looked like they were going to fare pretty well.. i'm interested to see what their camp does at the ol' burning man..  and then. then i rode the train home. and slept most of the way. and got funny looks when i got up to get off at my stop. looks like "you're getting off here? this is out in the middle of nowhere!"  it was good. so. that's where you'll find me now.
