I will be so bored..have to sit in a synagogue for about 2 hours..telling us the story about Rosh Hashana.  Its like a never ending speech..hearing the same story over and over and over again..Its not as long as the Yom Kippur ceremony...but...o shit! its in one week!!!!!!!!!!!!! I might come back tomrow from Shul..or i might just get kiked out of the ceremony for dancing around like a madwoman out of bordeness....i have to go righ now.  Simone...Your the only person around here who understands me........FEEL OUR PAIN!
