His hair there is as full and bushy as ever...  He's so cute.  He seems tired, but happy to be home.  I'm so glad he's back. I was lonely...  I really want to paint.  Hopefully tomorrow night I'll be able to get to an art supply store. ....Aaron wants me to give him the painting... ..I think I will....  ...If I actually finish it and am happy with it...  ....That seems unlikey.. :/
