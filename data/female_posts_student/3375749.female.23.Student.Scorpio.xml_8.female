Each person in this event had tickets for a free drink off the bev-cart. Well to make a long story short, my boss forgot to tell me that I had to write everything down that they got with the free tickets. So end of story- I made  way  more money in tips than I should have. But my boss was so cool about it. He was like, "Well you deserve it anyhow. Next time we'll know how to do it the right way." Now most of you out there would say that it was just a misunderstanding that led to my extra cash, but no. It was the money candle.   After work tonight Jeff and I are going over to Slade's house to watch a Nascar race. I'm not into it personally but Jeff and just about everyone we hang out with is. So I guess I'm going to suck it up and just make myself get into it. I'll just find the cutest guy and root for him. Well I have to get ready for another exciting day at the golf course.
