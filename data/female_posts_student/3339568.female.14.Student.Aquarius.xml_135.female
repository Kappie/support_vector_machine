Wally was a Gym  and  Radio Nazi this time. I hate missing people. Mel and I wrote our song 4 Ernie and it is really funny! Hehe. And we even managed to chuck in some advertising for World Cafe. I like our Tuesdays. They're good stuff they are. Mmm..I dont have much else to say. Wow. Now THAT is strange.
