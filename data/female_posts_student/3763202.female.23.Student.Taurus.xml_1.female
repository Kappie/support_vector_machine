Or, at least they aren't what I would have described as average when 'I' was a kid. Most of these kids have learning disabilities, ridiculously high energy, some pretty serious behavioral issues and some pretty dire home-life situations.Some are wealthy, most are poor. Some have two parents, most have one. Some have three square meals a day, most survive primarily on the snack provided to them midday.  I have never claimed to be good with kids. I'm not a teacher, or even an Ed student. I'm not compassionate or kind-heartedor any of the things you'd expect people working with kids to be. My motto used to be: Whoever would give me a job working with kids is a frickenmoron. I'm caustic, I'm harsh, I'm a walking nutcase...and right about now, I'mthe best thing to ever happen to these thirty kids aged 8-17. Why,you ask? Because, unlikeso many people in the world, I care.And that simple fact alone has allowed me to accomplish the impossible; I've been let into their world. And surprisingly enough, it isn't the black that I expected it to be. It's actually as multi-coloured as a rainbow. But like a rainbow, sometimes you have to work in order to see it.   This summer is seriously making me think about the state of our children. Perhaps I lived asheltered life, but it seems to be thatlife isbecomming increasingly difficult to bear.Far too often, the ones left behind are the children. I meanreally, who benefits the most from welfareprogram,social services, health care andeducation? Our youth. So, as we systematically slay each of theseprograms one by one, thebiggest casualties of the Albertan political war are the ones most forgotten.   We tend to view the state of our children as collateral dammage. We want to pass the buck off to whoever we can hold responsible. Parents, teachers, government- no one is to blame. But, in truth, aren't we all a little to blame?   A social worker came and visited my site a few days ago and asked the kids: What is one good thing that you can do to improve the state of the world. I was the last to answer, and my answer was simple. "I am doing the one thing that I can to improve the state of the world. I am here, reaching out to our most valuable assets: our children."   So, today's word of advice: Cherish the children, they'll be the ones taking care of you when you're a senior. Take the time to play, if only for a few minutes, with a child as oftenas you can. And never, never think of children as being a waste of time-sometimes they are the only things worth making time for.  Livin' it up,  Zita
