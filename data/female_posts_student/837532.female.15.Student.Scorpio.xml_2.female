It was fun, but then he told me that tomorrow he's leaving to go to Boys state for the week. I wont get to see him for a whole week!! *tear*....*sniff sniff*....i gonna miss him! I'll be countin days till he comes back! (haha yesh i know i be pathetic)...  hrm my parents were fighting again a few moments ago...but they just stopped. That weird silence that always follows at night is sorta freaky..and weird....and yet a relief.   my latest darker poem is titled "Lifeless" here it is   A dark nightmare plays in my head Thousands of tiny nails scratching the chalkboard Demons spawned within plague my thoughts Mixed feelings collide; forming a raging storm All reality has been lost; emotions locked in sanctuary I am left empty; lifeless merely a reflection of life, I walk A human figure void of true “life” inside   i have no clue when i wrote that but i remember it was one night before i went to bed when i was just feeling empty and alone inside.   hrmm that's strange, one of my internet friends said he'd be right back about an hour or so ago...and he still hasn't gotten back on. guess he got kicked off. Hope he didn't do anything stupid! He said if he didn't find a girl soon he wouldn't be here much longer! he worries me sometimes, but he's a cool dude to talk to! a fun friend, but he lives in Cali!! wish he lived closer so we could hang out!   which reminds me my other guy friend who does live around here is comming over tomorrow to play with our kittens. I had no clue he liked kittens...guess I learn new things every day! guess that's it...later
