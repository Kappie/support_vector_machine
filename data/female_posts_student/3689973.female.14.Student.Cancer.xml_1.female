The About Me thing is still not working. and neither is the chatterbox thing. I got a bug bite on my hand and its itchy. How did I get a bug bite? I was looking at other people's blogs and all of them r either all kewl w/links and stuff or not a journal type thing. neway none r like mine. Im watching that new show Quintuplets. I don't think its gonna last. Just like Andy Richtor's other show. On weekdays there will be more than just babbling in my posts. Ha I was just thinking. Like around the middle of the year I told my friend Hillary that I needed to learn how to babble. My notes were always so dull (not that there not now just a little less). She told me that u should just write what ever comes to mind. I think I took her advice a little too well. I need to shave. but theres not enuff time left. I guess I'll just b a little fuzzy 2morrow at Y Camp. Wahoo. I love camp. the reason I'm going to bed in less then 30 minutes. I am so going to take the week of 5-9 off. gonna go try to get my About Me thingy to work. TSCHÃœS
