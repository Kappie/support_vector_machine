I was supposed to talk to Marty at lunch today, but I had a Key Club meeting, so I couldn't. I felt bad because he wanted to talk to me about something. Oh well. I guess I'll find out later. Oh, after school I was talking to him on the phone, and then it beeped, so I switched lines. And who was it on the other line?! Bobby! Yeah, so we're talking, then a half hour rolls by and I realize that I forgot about Marty!! I felt soooo bad! I told Marty what happened, and he was mad. I don't blame him, but I really did feel bad. Oh well. I just thought it was weird that I talked to Bobby. We never talk, and then he calls me to talk...it was just weird. Oh well...I'm not complaining! After I told Marty I was sorry sooo many times, I went to Amanda's house. I got to drive on the way there. Sure, it was only down the street...but that's like a record for me! I did a really good job too! We watched Never Been Kissed. I LOVE that movie! It is so awesome! Then after that, I came home and here I am! I hope that tomorrow is a good day. I think it should be.
