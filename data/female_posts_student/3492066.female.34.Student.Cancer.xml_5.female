It was a rough Memorial Day for me then, living with him and my mother to make sure he was cared for. He was dying, and on June 8th he passed away shortly before 10 p.m. I must say that I miss him, and my grandmother too; she had passed away from cancer on 5 November 1999. Until they died, I could never imagine a time when they wouldn't be around for me, when they wouldn't be alive, my grandfather watching golf and making running commentaries on the football game while poking through one of his thick tomes on history. Meanwhile, my grandmother would flit around the house like the Titanic before it sank, big and grand. My grandfather had worked as a banking executive, my grandmother as a night-club and opera singer. They both had their imperfections, things I could barely tolerate about them, but those were things that made them who they were even if my grandmother had too many shoes and a dress dripping with rhinestones.  I miss them.  My grandmother left me a legacy of showmanship, that if one was to be showy, one had to do it with style and grace. She gave me a love for the arts, although she said I could never make a living being a writer let alone an archaeologist. Oh, yes, and she also left me the legacy of her shoes. When she passed away I was the only one in the family with big enough feet to fit them. Most of them I've had to store away, beautiful as they are, they are not walking shoes, and for now I need practicality over beauty.  My grandfather left me curiosity and a love of science and learning. He was always reading: books, newspapers, magazines. He had the requisite National Geographic as well as the Smithsonian magazines, and I got raised with a healthy dose of PBS, "National Geographic" programs, and "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" along with my Scooby-Doo cartoons. I guess it's in part because of him that I'm very interested in languages and their origins, most notably the Indo-Europeans and Proto-Indo-Europeans.  Well, I shall see what I can do about making this day a bit more cheerful.  Guten Tag
