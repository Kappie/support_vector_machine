That is not like me. As you can tell, I am avoiding it right now by going on the comp, today I went out for breakfast, then shopping with Chelsey, then out to eat, and for a walk. The list goes on. I mean I know how much doing good on this means to me, but I guess studying has not paid off in Summer School. Everytime I studied for a test I either failed or almost failed. If that is what I got on those then I mean, really why bother studying. I am not saying I didn't study at all. I just didn't study as much as usual. I remember most of the material and I KNOW that I am an amazing writer and from MANY people have been told I am very talented in writing. I KNOW that. I need to prove it tomorrow. The Summer School Social teacher loved my essays except one. The essay I know is my thing. MC is a little scary, but I mean you practically can't study for that shit anyways. All you do is read things and interpret - comprehending material...AHHHH. It will be ok though, everything always works out. Besides if I want to be a Bio major they aren't going to care if I am not a hard core history nerd (Well except Model UN cause that is just fun) and well I know it means a lot to me to get into university, but I have learned something greater. I CAN accept things the way they are now. I CAN deal with failure. After all I failed a lot of things in Social 30. No, I am not saying I am going to fail the diploma. I am simply just going to try my best like always. That is all I can do. The rest is up to the other half of the world ----> My fait lies in the good ole' scantron machine and markers in Edmonton (Which are damn well going to give me at least 80% on my essay, I am going to make it so good that we will feel I deserve nothing less. After tomorrow I can stop worrying about stupid Social 30 and Summer School. My Summer can OFFICIAL begin. I can have more fun and not worry for a while. I like that idea!
