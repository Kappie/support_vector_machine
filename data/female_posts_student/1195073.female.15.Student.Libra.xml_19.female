We're planning on having it at her house (they have a pool!!!!).  Not many pools in the ghetto, you say??  It can be a boughetto party (upper class, yet ghetto at the same time).  We will have to find out some more about street culture before we can really plan anything.  We also will need to find some props and stuff..........  I'm thinking HUGE gold chains and stuff!!!!  I WILL GET TO WORK ON THE GUEST LIST/INVITATIONS AS SOON AS SOMEBODY FINDS OUT IF WE CAN HAVE IT OR NOT (if I'm in charge of the guest list, you know who WON'T be invited)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think we should play a game called 'Rob Your Neighbor Blind' where you turn off the lights and let everyone kick each others asses to see who can steal the most stuff from everyone......  OK, maybe that's not the best idea.......  Anywho............  Courtney, e-mail me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Matt Z, you dissed my posts at the MZM Forums!!!!  POINTLESS????  OK, they are a little pointless...........................
