And then I hung out with Gabby,Cindy,Kevin,Kevin,Keith,Josh, and these other ppl. I just got so bored...everyone was outside. I mean..it was a nice day Sunday. Me and Cindy got super bored one day and so she got out gel and rubberbands and just did my hair. It looks really good. Anyway, I talked to Tia and she's having a good time being back with alla her friends. She's soo lucky, i mean I have friends here but i'd do anything just to go back to WV. Sometimes, or most of the times i just hate it here. But sometimes its alright i guess....I'm really not used to alla the different kinds of ppl. I just think I left a bunch of loose-ends when i left. Things might have worked out..I'm sure some how they would've. I just really wish that I could go back. Nothing is really working out here. There has to be a way. I mean...Ryan moved here from NY and he gets to go back every summer but summer is too far away!
