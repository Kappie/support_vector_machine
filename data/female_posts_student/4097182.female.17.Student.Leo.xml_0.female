I was having cramps on my toes n hou shun tried to help, but he yue bang yue mang.... He bent my toes wif e cramp instead of upwards against it n i almost cried... Luckily another guy came along to help instead... Otherwise, i think i'll be lame by now...  Our 1st part of e activity was kind of relaxing, but.... we had to lie down on e floor n put our cheeks on e floor while warming up... I think yinghan really very wu yuan wif e guo qing liang bcuz, everytime he came, she didn't go n vice versa...  Now, i'm gonna tok abt 'her' again.....  Guess wad? She yelled at me in e com lab in front of ~20 ppl!! She didn't do anything for e written report except e biblio, survey analysis n in text citation for me n pris part(very min, n was juz copy n paste into e body) Jiam was doing both intro n conclusion, so i sent her me n pris' part last nite, but she couldn't receive it... Tt's wad e meeting during pw was for, to finish e WR... As pris n i had finished wif our parts n our editing, we did our own stuff.... Pris was doing her mail thingy n i was attaching my hist notes... 'She' was busy w/o a purpose as usual... Ya, n jiam realised she couldn't finish both, so she asked us if we could help, n so we did... However, we didn't noe how to do e rationale for task 1, so we sought help frm tt "forever busy wif something" fui foon... She came over wif a not so nice face (btw, her face looks horrendously ugly, which my frens n i found unexplainable) n started bending down to type... We tot it was rather xing ku for her height, so we asked her to type at her com instead... Then, she showed us her bu shuang face, n got us to do e rationale for choosing e topic.... Pris n i were discussing, when she interrupted, asking me to translate wad i had recorded (jiam's ideas were in chi n i didn't noe how to translate, so they asked me to pen it down accordingly)... I tried to help her as much as possible n was toking to myself to c if e sentences i translated linked... I later repeated n asked for her opinion, but she didn't gif an answer.... So, i looked at her screen to c wad she was doing... I realised she misspelt 'chosen' for 'choosen' n so i pointed out to her in a very polite way.... This is wad i said,"I think u spelled an extra 'o' for chosen..." Then she slammed e keyboard drawer, pushed e chair backward real hard n yelled at me so loud everyone in e com lab stared at me," U so clever u come n do lah!!" Well, as everyone noes, i'm not someone to be trifled wif, esp when i'm yelled at for doing nth wrong, so of cuz i shouted back at her," Ni xian zai gen wo fa shen me huo? Ni yi wei zhi you ni you huo arh! Ni shen me dou mei you zuo dao lor!" "Shen me jiao wo shen me dou mei you zuo dao?!" she RETORTED, packed her things n stomped off...  I was so angry n felt so wei qu for i was being fired at for no reason esp when i hao bu rong yi rushed out my part of e wr n edited pris' part as well... i mean, i completed my fen nei things liao lor.... So, i walked out too... Then i saw jiyu waiting for history lesson n i couldn't bear it any longer, so i toked to her... (very agitated of cuz) irin n xueying sensed something wrong so they came over too.... I was so angry n wei qu, i broke down... Then, mr tan came... I think he was quite shocked to c me so agitated n crying cuz i'm always bubbly n cheerful in his class... He suggested i go for a drink to cool down 1st then join in e lesson wif jiyu....  I felt better after toking it out, so i went up to e com lab to collect my things... There, i saw jiam, pris, man n ying jing coming out n they told me tt fui foon was in there oso... I hesitated, then decided to go in... I saw her wif peiyu n she actually apologised, saying she bu shi gu yi fa wo pi qi but juz bao cuz she ren bu zhu..... I glanced at her n realised she had tearry n bloodshot eyes, meaning she was crying n complaining to others lor... Hugh! Juz as i expected! Make me look like huai ren again... Machiam i bully her... Not surprising if she had gone to complain to ms tan either... Anyway, her impression of me couldn't go any worse.... Anyway, since she had apologised, i apologised oso lor you bu hui tong...  In e end, jiam n pris completed e wr though it took longer than e pw lecture period n i suppose mr ng wouldn't mind as long as we handed it in....
