This is from the  urlLink Lonely Planet guide :  "Travelling by car is again an option throughout most of Bosnia and Hercegovina, although some roads remain in poor repair from war damage, and there's a fair chance you'll experience a carjacking. To top it off, the locals aren't the world's most cautious drivers - drunk driving incidents are on the rise - and service stations are scarce outside the big cities. If all this doesn't deter you, your best bet is to convoy with other vehicles and do all your driving during daylight hours."  This sounds pretty fun to me. Carjacking, bad roads, drunk drivers. At least we won't be doing much more than driving to Banja Luka from Croatia and back.
