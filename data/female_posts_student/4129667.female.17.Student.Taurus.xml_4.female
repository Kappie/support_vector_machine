       
      So, after field hockey (and graciously giving Seth Robertson an ice cream sandwich) and the obligatory hi-Joe-I'm-tired-can-I-take-a-nap? few hours, the four ladies who are in town got together to celebrate ZAREEN'S 17th BIRTHDAY!  In no particular order, those ladies were myself, Zareen, Nadia, and Natanya.  Tayn wanted to go to Olive Garden, so we did.  And after getting on and off of Route 30 (it goes all the way across the country!) about 3 times, we eventually made it there.  We owned the place, then headed back to Zareen's house to light lots of candles and watch a totally random movie.  Highlights of the evening included: - Jesse and his bubbly-ness :) And leaving him a nice note - Tayn not knowing that Zareen could control her window - Tayn's lemon - On Edge being the weirdest and one of the funniest movies ever - The __________ Hotline... keepin' it on the DL, yo - The muffin song  Aaaaand I still haven't started summer reading.  Um, yeah.  And it's rained a lot.  The end!    So let it rock, Let it roll, Let the bible belt come and Save my soul Hold onto sixteen, as long as you can Changes come around real soon, make us women and men
