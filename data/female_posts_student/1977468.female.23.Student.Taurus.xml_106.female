Brezer is joining the cr3w, and maybe in the future Eric or Chrystal. I haven't asked them about it, so don't break the news. It's our little secret for now.  So Breanna and I will be joining forces to bring twice the updates (hopefully) as however many are happening now, and all this for one less click of the browser then you all currently are suffering through. This could double the traffic. All of the above fermenting I have decided is good; because this is America- the land of bigger-better-more.  Perhaps if Eric joins on, he can do movie reviews. Remember that? He was going to do movie reviews once upon a time.  The point of this post is: don't be surprised if the site goes through some growing pains in the next few weeks. Notice I changed the template... this one is written in XHTML - its not as customizable as my last one. Not to worry though, I hope to take a webdesign class at clark. Perhaps if I do that, I'll have the tools to get creative with the site. Right now it feels like I'm rubbing sticks together.  Between the shoutbox and the new comments feature, I hope we can gradually move to the comments. The shoutbox space could be better used somehow. Also, the comments would be more topic oriented- as they are posted in reply to an entry.
