I don't know if what I did with him Saturday (in preparation) was really of any help... but, he thanked me anyhow, and that's more than enough payment...!  :-)  CONGRATS, DRUCK!!!  Anyhow... that's all for now...  Oh, and I've had some BNL lyrics stuck in my head...    Upside Down  ...I'm not surprised it's come to this Sooner or later there must be another's kiss Behind that kiss a promise of a life of bliss Yeah, great I won't be takin' the bait I'd rather drown And I will not turn my whole life upside down  Imagine everything you've done Under a microscope on view for everyone And if the King of Circumspection's here He's come in vain I won't be sharing the blame I wear the crown And I will not turn my whole life upside down...  It's a good cd... I wish it were a BIT more silly like the other cds... but I like the serious BNL side as well...
