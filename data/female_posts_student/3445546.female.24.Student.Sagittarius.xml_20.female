(clearly, this was helpful to bring in larger tips, but seriously, felt overexposed, which is saying a lot for me.)  anyhow, all i could think about was how i looked like i had mugged an eight year old for her tiny tshirt.  i also got to wait on the owner of the bar that i work at and his buddies, who drank for several (think like ten) hours.  they were absolutely wasted and slightly obnoxious (especially with the child sized shirts), but you know, they tipped really well, so...i'll get over staying three extra hours after the normal closing time of 2am.  oh yeah, i served them until five in the morning.  it was quite a treat...whatever though, i brought in over $300 in tips that night, which means rent is covered.    what else?  i have a date in a week that should be interesting.  a guy (note that i say guy...normally i would say boy, but he is clearly a guy, given that i think he is about 10 years older than me) that i meant at work (he doesn't work there, just hangs out after golf) who has asked me out.  he seems super nice, normal and actually very funny (always important to me), so what the hell, i'll give it a go.  so, i'll keep us all posted on that and how that works out.  what else?  heading up north to traverse city in a day or so for a nice break.  planning on only laying in the sun, playing on the beach and drinking beer the entire time.  screw eating food, it is a beer diet for me for those three days.  in preparation for the traverse trip, i needed to go swim suit shopping, but the only available time was when i was babysitting my 10 year old cousin, who needless to say was not thrilled with the prospect of waiting for me to evaluate which suit looked the best.  we negotiated it out, he waited, i and i then spent the next TWO hours in the freakin' arcade, reading the paper and holding the 2,568 tickets he won off from the $40 he squandered away.  right, he's not spoiled or anything...  that's about it really.  i am exhausted (damn bar owner), getting a bit sick, but not dying from high blood pressure or obesity and i have a pending date that may or may not see me in my new swim suits that cost me two hours of my life in an arcarde.
