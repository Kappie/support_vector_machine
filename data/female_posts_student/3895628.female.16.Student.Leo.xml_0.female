One person i call my own. One person i've loved the most. The person who taught me to face reality and to live with it, who accepted and loved me for who i am, who taught me to be honest and to be real to my self, who've cared me the most and who've loved me the most.  Thanks for bringging out the best in me. Thanks for helping me to realize things and to face this real world. Thanks for helping me to overcome my fears, for letting me experience things that helped me to discover the real me. Thanks for your support, for your guidance and your LOBE.  Things might not go in our way. I promise to stay by your side. i'll be here for you. i'm ready to wipe your tears dry and to comfort you. i'll be with you thru joys and even your darkest days..
