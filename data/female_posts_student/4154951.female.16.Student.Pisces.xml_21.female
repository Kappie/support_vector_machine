Oh well, I'll try to make up for it here...      The OC was so good last night! I'm slowly becoming a Summer/Seth 'shipper.. They're not bad together at all..quite cute really. =o/  Next week, Anna Stern comes back and the Summer/Seth/Anna triangle continues... Having to wait one week sucks... OMG Julie Cooper is a cow! I know she's just a character, but if I ever see the actress who plays her on the streets (when I go to the US, nyahh) I'll probably end up whacking her with my handbag or whatever I'm holding.      My bud Jess just showed me some pics of a guy called Blue..yes that's his real name.. My verdict: he is very cute. >oD      Since today's Wednesday, the school timetable and belltimes are screwy. Wednesdays are 'Pastoral Care' days. I.e: we spend an extra ten minutes in homeroom pretending to ponder about our development and spirituality, while just sitting around staring at walls/ceilings/chalkboards and just being pissed off by the fact that our lunch is chopped by ten minutes because of it.      I have PDHPE next... I'm so dropping it at the end of the year.. I hope I can sell the textbooks I no longer need at the end of the year.. I also hope that I sell them for a good price.. (Good price = just $5 less than what I bought it for)      Useless Camille Fact #805: I played the angel in my 6th grade Nativity Play.
