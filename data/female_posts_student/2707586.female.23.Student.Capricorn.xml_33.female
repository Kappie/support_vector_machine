I got a 69 which is a C so I'm cool but what upset me about the whole deal was that my teacher white-outed our grades and regraded because she thought our grades were too high. She cut me 5 points total the second time, four of which were because I can't add. She had already taken a point off then she went back and took four more! I did everything else right I just can't add! You think they wouldn't penalize me for messing up something I learned 17 years ago. That's a long time to remember how to do something! Just because you do it every day, they think you should remember. I no longer like my math teacher! Other than that, I am having a nice day and I hope everyone is too! (Lots of leftover Valentines candy!)
