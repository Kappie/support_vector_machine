A person has to be active and lively. I've fallen in love with silence. I want nothing but just a silent atmosphere in this world. Just for this particular day. I don't wanna talk to anyone. Neither do i wanna listen to anyone. All along, i'm still a loner after all. Just feel particular sad and depress for today.
