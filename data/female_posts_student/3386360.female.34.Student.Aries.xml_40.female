Then dragged myself out of bed this morning. Not sure what was up but I should could NOT wake up. Got Joey and Travis out the door then Rachael left YAY. She will be back today to get her stuff.. Oh thank you Goddess. Tony is waiting for someone to log on so I am unable to go onto MSN no big deal. I just want to go to bed but the satilite guy will be here sometime this morning. I had to fight with them anyway and plus I'm watching a neighbor's kid for her. Not looking forward to this I have a real problem with this child. He is rude and thinks nothing of interupting and being annoying. Plus on top of that he is just.. ugh.. how do I discribe it ?? raised wrong ? yeah that is the gentle way of saying it. Other then that I have to make a call today to resechdule my appointment. It was suppost to be today but no way I can make it. Not enough hours and no real transportation. I mean I could make it but if I did then I would have to be able to drive. I'm going to go watch spiderman for a bit and make something to eat so I can take my pills. I just want to go back to bed. Maybe I will go to bed early I do have a full day tomorrow.
