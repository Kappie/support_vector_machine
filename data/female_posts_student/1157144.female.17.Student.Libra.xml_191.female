"Earned teaching credentials from the University of Zaragoaza, Spain and an MS in Technology and Chemistry of Industrial Edible Oils and Fats."  suddenly i feel unbored... that must have been the most pointless education EVER... i remember him telling me about working in a lab testing vegetable oil... now it makes sense... weird as fuck
