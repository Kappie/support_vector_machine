I picture us in 10 years, with kids.... and still madly in love.I cudn't picture myself without you... you're just so amazing!! I don't want you to worry, if we can't talk as much as before, ur studies are ur priority, Just remeber that im here thinking about you non-stop. I hope you have a nice time in Amsterdam and Germany, say happy birthday to ur grams,and juizo meu anjo....But i trust you!! Tomm I'm gonna buy 4 cds.. and all of them remind me of you, cuz i heard those songs with you...and i just like them: -Nightwish(=]) -The Rasmus(=])  -Seether -and Nelly Furtado,cuz there's the cute song, try on it... and i heard it lots of times in Saiupe!          So i'm gonna post  a part of Seether's song Broken, the one where he sings with Amy Lee:   Broken  I wanted you to know  I love the way you laugh  I wanna hold you high  and steal your pain away  I keep your photograph;  I know it serves me well  I wanna hold you high  and steal your pain   Cause Im broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough  Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome  And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away
