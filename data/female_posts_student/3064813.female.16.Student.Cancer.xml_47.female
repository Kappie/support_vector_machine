My friend Allison had gone first, and the teacher was explaining to us that this machine showed a person's soul.  It was kind of weird... but really cool at the same time.  Allison's frigging soul was up on the wall.  All it really looked like was this fantastic landscape, but the cool part came when the teacher asked her to think of something that made her happy.  These blue waves rolled across the landscape, and the little Allison-figure grinned.  Then she thought of something that pissed her off, and the waves turned red and angry, and the Allison-figure started to look really apocalyptic about things.  Everyone else in the class went, and finally it came to me.  They hooked me up and I looked up at the wall but all I saw was white, with a pathetic mirror image of myself standing there in the middle of all that horrible nothing.  The teacher told me to think of something that made me happy....  I waited for the blue waves to come, and I waited for my figure to smile but the waves didn't come and my figure looked around like she was waiting for something, and then suddenly my figure was smiling....  But there was nothing there.  It was all still white, and she was only smiling because the thing I thought of should of made me happy.  They unhooked me and I tried to smile and make a joke, but everyone just looked at me and they knew my little secret.  I was blank.  There was nothing there. When I woke up I felt dead.
