I almost forgot a H U G E congrats to my girlies,  urlLink Lisa , who passed her second certification exam for her job and is now "Super Cute Lisa, R.M.D.S." (or is it rdms?)  And  urlLink Fuzzy , who got the department switch/promotion(?) that she had been hoping for.  I am tres proud of both of them.  They are both now  WAY  more official than you and cooler, AND I knew they could do it and I am  so, so, so, so  proud of them.  Way to go, girlies!
