That way she could see it. She said it is Beautiful. ^.^ Now my dress is long enough that it still brushes against the ground but I won't step on it when I walk. So it's all groovy.   After getting that done, Ash and I went to Sonic...in Manchester. Fun stuff....I guess. Well, it was fun when we went to Claires (back in T-town) and Dillards. I got a new skirt. It's uber cute. I wouldn't have gotten it but Ash said it was really cute so I did. And it was super cheap. Originally $34.00-Marked down to $8.50. GOOD DEAL EH?? Then I got a pair of OP pants there on Friday...originally $44.00- marked down to $11.00. Good stuff Man.  Well...I guess that's it for now. I don't really have much else to say...except I am UBER excited about prom!!!!!!
