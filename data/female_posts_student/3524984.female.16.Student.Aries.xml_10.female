I usually dont care, like before there was always next year to talk to my friends...but now, there is no more "next year" And there is no more friends to talk to. I'm moving, so I am automatically changing schools. Dammit. Billy is moving to, but only two streets down. Meh. Lucy ass, gets his old friends back, he gets Joey, and the same town. Here I am, no Billy, no friends, no same town. Bah, I should just fuck it I guess...But I want a good chance,more like a fair chance a being sucessful at life and school...stuff like that.  I guess I'll have to get throught next year alone.  I will survive. I mean, new school chance of change..right? I dont want to change..but whateverâ„¢ Hopefully they aren't a bunch of stuck up losers who they think they know it all...:P My choice of french to english is a bit drastic. I know. But hey, a highschool is a highschool is a highschool. *duh* Just a diffrent shit load of preps, right? :P Oh no, major factor: Preps. Yikes. They scare me. Uh-huh, yes they do :'( Maybe they'll belong to a nice society of preps. *Meh, dream on loser*  I dont know. The fact that I'll probably only be spending two years there makes me feel ALOT better. I wont be a prisonner in my own school. Just turned 16 in grade 11. Is that normal. I think so. I'm supossed to be in 12th because I was offered to take summer classes to get over 79 in math so I could boost up, but nah. Enough that I'm going to be new there, I dont want them to think I'm a french brainball...yucky.  I'm leaning towards their sports team. Basketball? Oh, hiya...it's my passion. ;) I hear at my new school they have "LAW" courses. Yayness. Oh, hiya...it's Law, my other passion. When Basketball and Law meet. ;)  *It's weird, Jenn wouldhave loved it..RIP Jenn :'(*  You know. I'm in love with this blogging thing. Like totally. No one reads it...but just to write and spread my thoughts. It feels awesome.   Oh, I joined a contest today at http://www.peta2.com "I am not a nugget" Yeh, you guessed it , I'm a vegatarien. :P I'm getting some stickers...YAY! :) So fun, so fun.  I just cut my hair, by myself...free hand. About 3 inches off the back. >. .  Ha, 6 days. Just 6...please help me make a countdown.  RIP Jenn * Love ya Hun!
