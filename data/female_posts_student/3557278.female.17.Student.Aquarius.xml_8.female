Yeah, lol James if u are reading this i think you have started something :P... i heard them play AGES ago! like on some random website or maybe triple J - i think it was "punk rock princess". yeah, it was. Well i remembered i liked them after jen told me :-)  Anyway, i'm doing this society and culture assessment. it's so hard sitting her practically forccing myself to do it. i feel like i'm repeating myself... ahh course concepts. woot.  Oh yeah, what i was going to say was... my stupid brother and his stupid school run the duke of ed scheme. that shits me to no end, because they do a lame ass easy version of it, while we go freaking trekking through the bush AND we get the same credit for it. lol, i wouldn't trade the hikes for the world, but man! it's so annoying, he wouldnt be able to hack any of the greystanes hikes. ha. stupid spoilt boy. nobody here understands cos they've neva been on one. ah well. ggrrr brother...
