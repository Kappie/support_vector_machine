I am a little upset that I didn't win but I guess I will just have to blame Brendan who choose my squares for me. Bad Brendan! Bad! Oh well.  I am remembering why it was I didn't want to go back to school. They expect me to work! Of course I guess it is better than actually working but still, who gives 50 review questions in math and then says turn them in? I don't know about this place.  Michelle- Pinnapple on Pizza is the only way to go. It's sweet and tangy and damn it, it just tastes good!
