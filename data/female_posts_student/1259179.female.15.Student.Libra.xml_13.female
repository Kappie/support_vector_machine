So what has been up...  Well lots...  I am continuing my health saga.  I am seeing the surgeon tomorrow again but this time for incisional hernias.  I will need to get them repaired. So this means yet another surgery.  I am already loosing so much hair and I am freaked out about all this.    I feel very left out in so many situations right now and I am trying to help but it seems that it is not required.  I guess I am very paranoid.  Anyway, I know that if I am needed...  I am there...  So on this short post,    Be Good and I will be back real soon
