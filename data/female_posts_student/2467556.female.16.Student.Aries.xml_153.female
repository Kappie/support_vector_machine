Seriously, the math was easy as well as the reading parts.  SATs make me hungry, my stomach was eating itself during it!!!    I also got my TAKS grades and report card today.  The frickin TAKS people gave me a 2 on my essay!?!?!?!  what the hell it was sooo not a 2!!!  Then again, i was just writing crap down, so i guess its what i get.  I got "Commended Performance" or whatever on Social Studies and Science...so i guess thats pretty cool! I think i should get scholarships for that or something.  Social Studies, i got all the questions right and on the Science TAKS, i got 50/55.  English TAKS, i was above average but not commended because i got 52/57 plus writing grade.  Math TAKS, i was the tiniest bit away from commended performance (surprisingly) and i got 43/56 on that....i think their grading is messed up.  I suppose i can expect to do pretty well on those TAKS tests my junior year!  No remedial for Mercer!!!!!!  Anyways, Report card stuff now.  I GOT ALL FREAKING A'S!!!!!!  After i finish this entry, i'm going to go calculate my GPA for the tri and average it with all my other GPA things from this year!  So i get Gold Renaissance AGAIN.  Thats twice in a row, its exciting.  You know, i like this A's thing, i think i'm going to try and acheive those more often.  All A's on my exams too except for IPC (86, thanks to gay Mr. Fleming).  Totally awesomeness.  Now all i need is my AP World History grade (which you all know that i didn't take the class for) and my SAT score, hopefully they're good grades :/  Oh man, Game 6 of Cup Finals tonight.....scary man.  I'm sitting on the edge of my seat and we still got 4 hrs until the game starts!  Let me give you the run down if you haven't been keeping up: Game 1: Flames win 4-1 Game 2: Lightning win 4-1 Game 3: Flames win 3-0 Game 4: Lightning win 1-0 Game 5: Flames win 3-2 in OT (as called by Barney, Britty's cousin, in which Britty lost a dollar in the bet they made) Game 6: game in Calgary, Tampa must win if they have any hopes of winning the cup Game 7: back in Tampa, we pray that we get a Game 7  so basically, if Tampa doesn't win tonight, it sucks because that means Vinny and Marty get no cup and i know from observation that if they don't win it, they're seriously going to cry.  And me and Britty will cry too just because we've gotten attached to these boys since Dallas got eliminated.  Pray that they pull a game 7 and this isn't just another Cinderella story.  i think me, britty and jess are getting together to watch the game tonight, but i dunno.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
