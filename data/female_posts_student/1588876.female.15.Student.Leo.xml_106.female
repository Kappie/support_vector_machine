Bobby and Wesley come over and sit and we chat. i got shot a few times by bobby and i shot him back...i missed, but i shot his chair so he had to wipe it off. im hard core. Why was Wesley wearing a G-Unit shirt? yeah...i thought it was kinda gay, but it was just  soooo  becoming on Wes.  "we should hang out some time"-bobby the following quote made me happy.  jake and i went to trader joes again and got some more MOCHI!!!!! this time we got mango. next time...we get some fuckin' chocolate. i ate my share of the mochi (3 balls i ate 3 balls )  before we even got back to his house. damn. what? they were really really good! hey, at least i had the grace to leave him the last two...and enough grace to say "excuse me" after my tiny belch.  jake- you ain't heard nothin' yet, bitch.  ; o P
