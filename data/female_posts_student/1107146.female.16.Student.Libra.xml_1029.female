(but I'm gonna TRY to see yall)  And the biggest news is #2.  I'm going on a cruise (yes, another one) to the carribean after we go to San Antonio... I guess that means more pressure on me to get well. So, I guess I'll be gone all of Spring Break.   Also, I MAY be @ church on Sunday, but definitely NOT at choir.  I'm seriously happy.  But, Liz, that does NOT get you off the hook from coming to visit me.  Yall, I'm SO glad I'm coming back.  I feel a buttload better, and I'm caught up in almost all my classes. So, I guess I'll see yall Monday.  YIPEE!!!!!!!  Wow, did that come out of my mouth...er, keyboard?
