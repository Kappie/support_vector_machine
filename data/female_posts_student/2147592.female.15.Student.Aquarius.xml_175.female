It was generally fun, the singing and stuff.  Second lesson was business, I didn't do any work, just emailed len and Rik constantly, I'm sure they enjoyed the fact that I did this. And I'm sorry I have to stop writing about my boring life because of Kris. He can say one thing and it pisses you off! No wonder why he deleted his blog. Arg! Well yeah, the rest of my day was highly boring. meh meh meh  Toodlefeekingpipxxxxxxxxxxxxx
