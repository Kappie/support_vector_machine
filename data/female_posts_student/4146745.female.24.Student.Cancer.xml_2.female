Lets see....Tomorrow Mikayla and I are going Horseback Riding with her Brownie Troop, well ours since I am the coleader.       Today I think I am going to go in and get Daunte his new shoes while Jordan is at T.A.L.K.      Yesterday I missed my Aspire appointment and was so scared I was going to get in trouble but nope, I sweet talked my self out of it. I can't believe that I forgot about it though but I go back in on the 31st at 2:30, 2 days before classes start since they have to meet with me before classes do start.      I think I need to get some new underware today too...so we will see if I get there.      Well be back in a few, I think I wanna write about Funtown on Tuesday. :)
