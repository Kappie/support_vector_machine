Only think. I just finally realized how much I have...well...changed. I was reading my journal last night (my actual written one, not the one that anyone can see). I was reading back to January through May of last year. In April or May I can accross something that really shook me. It was a list of "Things That Make Me Happy". Do you know how many things I had listed?  50.  Fifty things that made me happy. Gosh, if you could have seen how simple and delightful each thing was. By the time I got to the third thing on the list, my eyes were welling up. And by the tenth thing, I had tears running down my face. Because it made me realize how horribly unhappy I've become. In just a matter of months, I have lost faith in nearly everything on that list. And to make it worse, I probably couldn't have thought of 15 things to put on that list anymore. I just don't think I'm supposed to have to be like this. And I read back further through my journal, and in nearly every single entry, with the exception of  only one! , I expressed so much joy and thankfulness for everything in my life. And probably the most ironic thing of all, was that I found myself envious of...well...myself. I found myself filled with  so much envy , for none other than the person I used to be.  It made me sad.   Well, off to go study or read or something. Ta ta for now, crazies.
