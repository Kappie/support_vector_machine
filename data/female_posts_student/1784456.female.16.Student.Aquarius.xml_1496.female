I know three peoples' GCSE results (cos they told me of course)..... Robyn got 3 C's and the rest D's, shes very happy with wot she got, Tim go 2A*, 5A's 4 B's and a C. Lynne do you remember the girl i pointed out at netball from plymouth and cornwall wing, called collette, well, apparantly she did really well, she got 8A*'s and 3A's which is amazing. I mean, I knew she was smart but i didn't realise quite how smart she was. Spent 50p credit which is all i had on my phone, txting tim about stuff. Thursday nite, got a phone call from robyn, the first time in ages i have actually spoken to her and not just emailed her or on msn msngr. She sounded really different, but thats what she s ses when she talks to me. She ses hi to you all, actually she ses hi to everyone i no and thats quite alot of people!! So am very happy because everything is okay in my world at the moment! hee hee! will blog l8r, xx, be happy, xoxoxox
