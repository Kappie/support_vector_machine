I went to the toilet at Dover MRT, I thought that Edmund and Yinnee won't wait for me, because they normally don't. When I came out of the toilet happily, but saw them there at a corner waiting. My mood swiftly turned heavy. After Yinnee alighted at Clementi, between the journey from Clementi to Jurong East seems a long time. It was embrassing, I and Edmund did not chat. I tried to find a topic to chat with him. Like where does he live, Edmund just reply  Jurong East lor.  He is really a man of a few words. I really never had a decent conversation with him before in my entire 4 years of education in Singapore Polytechnic. I nearly wanted to faint. I kept looking at my watch, praying in my heart MRT faster MRT faster reach Jurong East. I swear during that short journey inbetween was a stand still in time. This is the longest and unbearable MRT journey in my whole damn life.
