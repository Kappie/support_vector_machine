She's never even met Steve!    Oh shit.  Gotta clean now.  But see, THIS is what I need.  A REASON to clean.  Now I'll kick ass!  Hey, its Good Friday and I'm at work.  What kind of blaspheming place is this?!  I think I need to boycott or something.  Of course the last time I tried to boycott not having a holiday off, it backfired on me... My old job used to give us Columbus Day and not Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday off.  So I made a pseudo-stink about it practically referring to the bosses as "racists".  What I really just wanted was an extra holiday off!  However, they thought about it, and decided that they'd give us the latter off, and take back Columbus Day as a work day.  SIGH.  I can't win.  On another note, I lost my virginity on Good Friday.  EWWWW!!
