We had three of the hottest drum techs alive, two who just got back from marching corps. They were so great, they pushed us hard, but they didn't break us. They came pretty darn close, but not quite.  At the beginning of the week I almost had the opener memorized, now I have it down really well, but doing it with drill it kinda difficult. I'll get it eventually. The third song is messed up, so I am gonna have to practice that one hard core. It is 180, and has so many beats. It's insane! Oh well. Maybe I'll get that one eventually too.  So, right now I am in more pain that I can ever remember being in. My feet keep cramping up, so do my calves. I have a slight sun burn on my shoulders, and my wrists are dieing.  Drill was fun, but we were hardly ever inside for anything. The average tempt this past week was around 100-102. At one point it was 106. Yeah baby!!!!! We made it! I have a killer sock tan too. I wore the high ankle socks just so that I could really see the tan. I know it's stupid, but I didn't wear sun block all week, and I only got a shoulder burn, which is good cuz it's not even that bad.  The last night there we had a potluck thing where all of our families could come. My family came, and so did my boyfriend. I hadn't seen or talked to him for almost a week, so I was really excited. What sucked though is I only got to talk to him for two minutes, then my mom started freaking at me because she couldn't find chase, my little brother. She was getting mad at me, as if it was my fault. It's not my problem that she can't keep track of all of her freakin children! Anyways, I had to go find him, which I did. He was with this girl named shaylee and they were looking at the turtles in the wildlife area. I went back to the cafeteria to talk to tyler again, but he was gone. That made me a little disappointed and pissed at the same time, but I had to go change into my shirt and study my drill anyway I guess.  We went through the whole rehearsal. It was fun...sort of. I was gasping for breathe by the end of it, but that's because of our last three sets. They are all double time, and you have to haul but in all of them. I would have to say that they are probably my favorite sets though.  After the rehearsal we had a dance with just our band. Walking out there I saw my brother and his friends that had just graduated. I asked bj where tyler was and he told me that tyler went home. He hadn't said a damn word to me at all, not even good bye or anything. I was pretty mad, but I decided that I would have fun at the dance without him. The dance was pretty cool, mainly because the drummer stuck together and we all just hung out there. I had fun anyway.  Next day was freakin hot, but we had an awesome rehearsal for three hours, then the drummer clan went to burger king. Real food, finally!!! It was great. Then I got home and that would bring us up to this point.
