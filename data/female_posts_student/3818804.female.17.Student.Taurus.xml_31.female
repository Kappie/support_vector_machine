Tj's called Leah and Jennay this morning. lolz...I don't know why they called after i got hired, but yea It was pretty funny. Jennay called me and told me and It was too funny, Leah too. The lady that called woke Leah up so she was groggy....lolz...  I'm off tomorrow! I don't know what I'm doing though...call me! ;)  P.S. Some people think that the physicals things define what's within, so full of the superficial...
