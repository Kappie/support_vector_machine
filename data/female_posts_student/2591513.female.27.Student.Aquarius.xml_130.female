My answer would have to be no...all expereinces good and bad have built my character and torn me down, but the rebuilding of myself has made me that much stronger...  ...besides me attempting to change something would probably end up backfiring anyway with my luck.  I have not been very lucky lately...  Ed will be gone for a few days.  I will miss him.  I like having him around, it will be weird when he isn't.  I am proud of him though and know he will do wonderful things in life.  I hate work-ups....work-ups can bite me.
