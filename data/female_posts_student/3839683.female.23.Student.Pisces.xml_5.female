Anyways I drove home as usually and once I got home I realized there was no food in the house so I ventured out to the grocery store. As I started to back out of my driveway I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed something was placed behind my back windshield wiper. I got out of my car to see what it was and the first thing I saw was "god loves you!!!!" I sighed.... Now I believe in the dude but... This is..Well not something I wanted to see attached to my car after driving 20-25 mins home in rush hour traffic. I could only imagine what the people behind me thought as I was blaring the "naughty words" music and having "god loves you!!!" plastered on the back of my car. I'm mad at the man above anyways.. This sign could mean one of two things. First would be that this was a sign to stop my pouting. Or that religious freaks get a discount on paper products in my town. Either way I'm gonna have a few beers and relax. Maybe he will join me... I think he deserves a break.
