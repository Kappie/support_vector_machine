I took my Psychology final today, and I got an A on it!  That means no more 4th block for the rest of the year!  Oh, that class made me so happy!  We never did anything, it's grand! I have a D in design, that means I'm gonna be spending all of flex all week working on a basket that is going to give me up to 200 extra credit point!  WOO!  I really need that!    I finally got up the nerve to call the Park District about my job!  (( I hate talking on the phone )) And I was like "I had an interview about a month ago and Brian told me I got the job, and he showed me my schedule, but I never got the papers in the mail!"  Then she asked me who I was and she told me that they would get those to me soon and that there is a Walk Through on Thursday and sometime that I forgot!  Woo!  That means I wasn't lying to my parents and they should apologive a zillion times because they put me through hell with all of the yelling!  I really did not appreciate it, because I knew I was telling the truth!   Ohh, and I might have a job at Target!  I need to work a lot this summer, because my car is dead!  There is no point in putting more money into because now its going to cost 2000$ to get it fixed and you can buy a used car with that much money!  So my mom and me had a talk and we decided that instead of going to The Art Institue when I graduate, I'm just gonna go to ECC for one year, to prepare myself!  That means, ... I get a new car because going to ECC for a year is going to save them so much money!   We had a whole discussion on college and I don't think I'm ready to go away to school!  I don't think I can take care of myself, I'm not mature enough!  And ... going to ECC can help me decided what I want to do with my life!  Now, I say I want to go into Graphic Design or Psychology, but what if thats really not what I want?  Then I would be wasting time and money going to a "big" school studying that!    Me and Karina went to the mall because she had to buy a skirt from Aero!  It is so cute, its they white skirt I wanted, but my mom wouldn't let me get because she said it was to short and skanky!  Aww, that made me a bit sad, but oh well!  There are so many cute clothes I want, I need to get a job or money or something!  I was thinking about taking money from my parents, but AHH, most of us know what happend last time I did that and I really don't want to get caught again!  Eeek! After the mall we went to Jewel because Karina had to buy supplies for making cookies for her Excel class!  As I was walking in I was pretty sure that I saw Rachel, Amanda, Alex, and some other people leaving!  I wanted to run up to Rachel and give her a hug, but then I decided not to because I didn't want to see Amanda or Alex because we all know how much I'm hated!  Aww, :o(  Anyways, I made sure Karina bought all cheap stuff to make the cookies becuase I didn't want her to waste her money on people none of us care about!  I saved her MUCHO money!  We did the self check out thing and it was so much fun!  The machine detected an "unknown object" in the bad area and it made me  laugh because the unknown object was my hand!  HAHA!  Then we drove home and I kept the bag safe, because I didn't want the eggs to break!  Karina dropped me off at home and I seat belted the bag of grocerys into the front seat, just to keep them safe!  HA, wow . . . I'm such a loser!  When I got home my dad went psycho on me and made me do yard work!  It made me mad because I need to clean my room because I have pink fluff all over my carpet, and everywhere is covered in clothes and it is really pissing me off!  So I guess I was a little bitchy towards him, but not enough to get cranky over!  Well, anyways ... my mom said that I made my dad cry and I don't understand what I could have done that is that bad!  I mean all I did is be cranky when he asked me to help with yard work, no big deal!   Well, then my mom told me that my dad is "sad" because he really thinks that I should be able to have a brand new car, because when he was my age his dad (( my grandpa )) bought him a really nice car!  I felt bad for being a bitch, I'm going to say I'm sorry when he gets home!  Ok, buh bye!
