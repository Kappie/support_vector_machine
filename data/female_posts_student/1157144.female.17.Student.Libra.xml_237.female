Billy- I think Houge would be fine, we've been there countless time late at night; the worst they can do is ask us to leave and Brian's house is right there so it's not a big deal or anything, seriously. I wouldn't worry about it. yay, everyone play hardcore style, dressing in black! Yesssuh!! Bring your shovles and pulleys, waha!
