I like the show and even if i have seen every episode i think 2 a day when nobody else is awake is fine. Now the catch if my sister wakes up in the MIDDLE of an episode. be it the first or the second we havwe to change the channel to what she wants to watch. I put up with it, but today she woke up right at the end of not even 2 minutes left and when it was over i put it on mtv. {what she watches alllllllll day} and the making of the movie "the bourne supremacy" was up next. Now i REALLY wnated to watch it and she said "NO". OS of course she comes and takes the remote. Her excuse...... i made her sit through Dawsons creek.. OH MY GOD it was two minutes. How does she watch tv .....? As soon as a comercial hits she changes the channel. Let me tell you she doesnt always need a comercial. If she doesnt know what the show is or if it just get boring and she watched it too long the channel is changed. How may you tell me is 5 seconds too long? NO i admit if i have seen a show and a new episode of something is on i chane between the two shows. TWO. my sister will watch atleast 15 at one time never knowing what is happenig. I gave her a choince. let me watch the making and she can pick the show alllll day. SHe said "NO" i guess it is probly because she gets the tv all day every day ne ways. I know what you are thinking. Go outside, but i have to call my mom and get permission adn its not like i have ne one to hang with. All my friends get to go on vacation. I never do. --------i have complained enough..........love amanda
