You help me through  the tough times,  and when I've lost all hope.  You cry with me at sad times,  and laugh at all my jokes.   You never seem to judge me  or ever put me down,  you put a smile on my face,  whenever you see a frown.   You're better than a brother,  you're more than just my boyfriend,  you have a special place in my heart,  that's why youâ€™re my Best Friend.
