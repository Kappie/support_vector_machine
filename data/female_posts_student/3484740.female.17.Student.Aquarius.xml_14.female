Its been like, 8 months now, I can't imagine anothe week will kill me! Haha. Its cute too, cuter than my other one(at least I think so..other people might not).  I'm not sure what is happening with Aaron, but I would love to be able to figure it out. I can't tell what he wants, I'm sorry that I like someone, but thats how it is. I would like to know what that post was about though. ''Just a song''. There has to be more than that. I dont know.  Anyway, I'm not going to write anything else for now. Maybe in a bit. Bye!
