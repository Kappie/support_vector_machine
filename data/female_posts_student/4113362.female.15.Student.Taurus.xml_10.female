It's so simple, and it's probably one of the first words all of you learnt; along with yes, it is taught at a very early age. Yet some of you, still don't seem to comprehend the meaning of the word. When you ask to see my boobs, and I respond with 'no', that is your cue to piss off and stop asking.   Curtis, I'm sorry, but that's a very VERY 'soft spot' and you need to stop..please. If you find humor in it, find humor in it outside of the time you're talking to me, please. I 'love you as a friend' buddy. Please stop being angered. I'm sorry for saying a bad word to you. I take back the evil.  I'm    so sorry   . Anyways. Yes. Curtis is my new 'boyfriend' ;) He makes my heart skip a beat. Ohhh yes...hahaha    "It's down to this, I've got to make this life make sense. I missed the life, I miss the colors of the world. Now again I found myself, so far down, away from the sun that shines. Into the darkest place, I'm so far down, away from the sun again."     Tonight...I'm hanging out with Brandon and Stephy.  We were  going  to go to the movies. I have no money, however, so we're going to do something free. Something free like....Standing on the side of the road..watching cars go by. Or maybe.. walking aimlesly around town. Or maybe even eating grass? Realistically though, we're probably just going to go to Stephy's house and watch movies.  Onto another note. I'm very proud of Stephy and I.  We're doing very good with the whole 'friendship' thing.  Everything is slowly, ( very very slowly ), coming back together. Everything is falling into place and I can't help but be happy!  I had to wake up at 8 today..and then I went for a walk after my mom left for work and I was back at home by 8:30. At 8:30 I went back to sleep and I ended up sleeping until 2:00. I feel so ...'yick' I'm happy Stephy called me because I would have slept forever.    That is all for now my friends;
