I got two boxs full of stuff so far. I didn't realize i have so much stuff. My parents have more of my stuff at their house. Its funny how much crap you can pick up over the years. Tom is having a big fireworks next weekend. Last year they had fireworks going for 45 minutes. I am so happy i am not going to miss it. Its funny how life works and how things are going in my life. I have met the most amazing people here in Brockville even if i don't like Brockville that much. I can't wait until i move back to Fredericton. Brenda is there and she is happy i am moving back too. I miss her she is such a great friend. Amanda is also happy and i will be able to see her more often because she is going to be only and hour and a half drive from Fredericton. Anyways hope everyone has a great day.
