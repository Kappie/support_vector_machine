Last night I woke up at 330 to watch the opening ceremony I love the olympics! The Opening Ceremony wasnt as good as Sydney I think personally maybe cause I am Biased! Today when I got home I watched the Olympics and Now I still havent turned them off I love the road race! Im going to bed soon but I will be waking up at 230 to watch Ian thorpe swim and 4x100m Womens Freestyle Relay Go Libby, Henry, Pocket Rocket and Ryan your all awersome! Tommorrow the waterpolo starts Im really excited the women have a really good chance! Not many people no this but I absolutly love the cycling!! Especially the Track! I could never do it if I tried but I also like the gymnastics their all so flexiable ( Im so Jealous!) My dream is to compete in the OLympic Games one day Ill keep trying but I dont think it will ever happen! Have a good Weekend everyone! Lv Bec   Sunday: Today I went to waterpolo training saw barbara. About 230 this morning I woke up and I watched Ian Thorpe win ( I would have rather hackett won!) the I saw the most amazing thing the Australian Girls win the 4x100m relay. They Broke the world record and won Gold! It wasnt just theyre swim which amazed me it was theyre reactions Pocket Rocket Alice MIlls was so Happy she was Crying!!! How amazing I also saw the Australian softballers beat the number 2 ranked team! The divers before these olympics Australia had only won 3 Olympic Medals after one we had Now won 5. Robert Helm and Robert Newbery (world champions)won bronze in the 10m sycronzied dive they were expected to win gold but bronze is still awersome! Chantelle Newbury ( Roberts Wife) and Irena Lasco also won bronze in the scronized 3m diving. THis awersome both being mothers and its just an achievement! This afternoon in exactly 7 minutes I will be watching day 2 of the olympics! Ciao Lv Bec Ps What did you guys think of the uniforms! By the way waterpolo is on today yay! Go AUsTRALIA!
