If World War Three breaks out, like I much expect it to, then I will be out of here. They will not se me for dust, I shall just go, I will probably jump on a train to Worthing or Brighton and go shopping!! I’m not staying in too get stuck in the middle!  It is a long story, but I shall explain it as simply as possible……………. I was at work when I got a message saying that she was ok the car was a mess, but Steph had been involved in an accident.  That’s where all the trouble begins….not the accident but the attitude of my dad who rang from the states, to quote my mum “your attitude fucking stinks*  My sister is the first to admit when an accident is her fault, and yes sometimes she drives like a rally driver, but you cant in Hove, there is just some much traffic. Anyways my sister was edging out of a junction slowly into a gap that someone had left for her, so it was not her fault, she has witnesses saying that the post office van was going far to fast. But my dad, who I love, just goes off on one, saying that she needs more lessons, that she should not be on the road, that she is a fucking idiot….blah blah blah…… I have to hand it to my mum she handled it well, but my dad just goes nutts. Saying how it has fucked up his new that he is coming home two days early. How the fuck can it fuck that up, the only way it could would be if she was dead, which he didn’t bother to find out….it just makes me angry….. So if WW3 breaks out, I am not staying around to witness it!!  Anyways…………………..that’s is not going to affect my happiness….nothing ever does I don’t think……la de da de da………………..  Ooh I don’t actually no anymore, I am slowly losing the plot even more I think, that’s really quite worrying, can I possibly lose much more of the plot? Hmmm I expect so……  Ah yes………ah no….ah yes…..I’m still here believe it or not… still confusing everyone, still being weird, still being Natalie. I am always Natalie.  Much love as always xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
