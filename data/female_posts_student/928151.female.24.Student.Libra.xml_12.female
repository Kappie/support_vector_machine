The garden scene (3. 4) is especially interesting in that it is so isolated from the general drive of the plot. In Romeo and Juliet you will remember that plot is not always Shakespeare's priority--there is always time for a lyrical aria like Mercutio's, or a comic scene that does not advance the plot. But so far in Richard II each scene has advanced the plot in a material way. The gardeners appear only in this scene, and even the Queen is a minor character (we will discuss Shakespeare's marginal women characters in the next module).     Why introduce the gardeners at this point?    The scene is clearly emblematic: the garden is treated by the gardeners (and hence the audience) as an extended metaphor for the state of England. [Note 3]  Read through the scene, and note the careful comparison the gardeners make between the cultivation of the plants under their care, and the need for good government to discipline the ambitious in order for the state to be fruitful and healthy.     What effect does the "rustic" accent of the actors have on your response?      Is the scene intended in part to be comic?      Or are the gardeners choric figures, voicing the response of the audience, and even of the play as a whole?      An Elizabethan garden. The use of symetrical "knots" makes the image of a garden more symbolic of order than a modern garden. From Thomas Hill, A Most Frief and Pleasant Treatise, Teaching How to Dress, Sow, and Set a Garden (1577).   The Queen sees the gardener as "Adam's likeness" (3. 4. 73), making again the parallel between England before the fall of Richard and Eden before the Fall.    Do you see her as a figure simply of pathos, self-pity, even, or a figure of anger, of strength?    England itself has been figured as female in the play.
