I have purple high-top Converse.  :)   Finals are OVER.  I got a B on my math final, isn't that FANTASTIC! I'm almost positive I have straight A's again.  I think I did quite well on my English final.  My stress is released, for the moment.  A three-day weekend, no studying to worry about, no homework, nothing.  My mother? Driving me crazy.  After my lovely stress release she talks of how amazed she is for a moment and then brings up Northwestern.  Now, I have really decided not to get my hopes up for this school, a lot of the admission is left up to luck with its 14,000 applicants.  But she insists that I will get in as long as I can get a 1450 on my SATs...ha...good one.  She then procedes to ask me if I was sure that I didn't want to take a fourth year of French,  4 ?? I can barely handle 3.  I'm sure this question will be brought up a few more times before signing up for classes next year.  Anyways, we are going to Illinois for spring break, we just booked our airline tickets.  We're going to visit the 4 schools I am applying to there: DePaul, Loyola, U of I, and Northwestern(if I remember to I'll take picture of the campus...it's gorgeous).  To get into Northwestern you have to go to an interview...how shitty is that! I can barely talk to people I know...I have a long time before I start applying, I really shouldn't stress myself.  See? See what I've done, I was just talking of how my stress is gone, my finals are over and my grades are good.  I of course had to drag myself back into the stressfulness that is me.    Well, I'm going to sleep in tomorrow.  Really sleep in.
