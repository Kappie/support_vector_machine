I said that the Cubbies play St.Louis this weekend, and they dont.  They play them in the next few days.  Won last night to the Brewers though and they are winning right now.    Movie Notes Last night I watched The Butterfly Effect.If you havent seen it, go rent it...right now-from blockbuster!  Forget about the SNL stuff.  Unless you want comedy, then go for it.  Besides the story line, I dont know who else could have played the part of Evan any better than Ashton Kutcher.I shouldnt say too much about the movie, but I might be adding this to my collection.    And this blog may be moving to another address, I can not add links and that isnt cool man.  Right now I have to go shower and get some groceries for dinner.  Cooking out on da grill.  peace.love.DMB.
