I'm starting to question whether or not we saw the same film.  Before I get to my review of  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and refute yours, let me first make an important disclosure and air a grievance.  Let me preface this posting by saying Charlie Kaufman is my cup of tea.  I understand he is not to everyone's liking, such a widely innovative, peculiar artist can't be, nonetheless I relish his brilliant, tender touch and the unique new worlds he creates with his strangely endearing characters.  That said, I think you were remiss by not stating upfront that you loathe Kaufman's work.   I am achingly perplexed at how you could find the thinking "shallow" and the emotions "tepid".  Of the films we've discussed this year not one of them has had more to say or presented two more honest, realistic characters embodying a true life relationship than this film.  Kaufman doesn't expect us to buy into the relationship because it's Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, he shows what pulls them together- his taciturn steadiness and her gregarious impulsiveness- will also be their ultimate undoing.  The tragedy, the truth to the story is these characters can't live with each other any more than they can live without each other.  Early in the film, what we think is their first meeting, Clementine tells Joel "I think you're nice, right now.  Later who knows what I'll think."  We all make these judgments on a whim, on a sliver of an interaction and when, in real life and in extended contact, they fail to live up to this standard we hold it against them.  One of the things I love the most about Charlie Kaufman movies is the tender connection the characters have.  From Lotte to Charlie to Joel they possess a fragile almost childlike love.  I'm chuckling you were dazzled by the storytelling because I thought this was the least Charlie Kaufman-like plot to date.  Unlike the twists and turns of his previous films  Eternal Sunshine  never wavered from it's original concept and left out the twists.  Unlike  Being John Malkovich  and  Adaptation ,  Eternal 's Charlie Kaufman plot was underplayed, playing second fiddle to the characters and relationship.  I thought  Malkovich  found the perfect balance between creating characters and a roller coaster plot;   Adaptation , one of the most audacious pictures of the past decade, was at times too clever for it's own good.  Kaufman and director Spike Jonze swung for the fence but didn't get all of the ball, though I admire their moxy.   Eternal  seems to me Kaufman's most nuanced and I hate to say it, mature movie to date.   Eternal Sunshine  is one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever seen and I mean that as the highest compliment.  Joel and Clementine made me smile and swoon, broke my heart and nursed it back together.  When I read your line "(It's) not about how love conquers all but how people can be weak and foolish and waste their lives on stupid destructive relationships" I thought of that last memory Joel erases.  "So go" Clementine says and Joel, his shyness never more acute, tells her he did because she sounded so dismissive.  She of course said it to be flip, to mask that she really wanted him to stay.  A week ago or so I issued an apology and as I walked away I remember thinking how slight it sounded, I truly was sorry yet I wasn't able to get that across.  I was certain the other person didn't understand how I really felt but I couldn't force myself to go back and explain.  I just walked away.  I don't think Joel was any weaker or more foolish than me and I don't think his relationship with Clementine is stupid and destructive.  Love doesn't conquer all, that's part of the problem- we want/expect it to.  Love exists in moments that we capture and collect in our memories.  What Joel and Clementine destroy isn't their love or each other but their recollection of how they felt at a particular moment.   Eternal Sunshine  has lingered in my head for days.  The reason I waited so long to blog is it's taken me all this time to find the right words.  We (mostly me) have spoken at length about Kaufman so let me make a few points on the collaborators.  Michel Gondry's hazy direction gave this story a distinctive look that was never distracting.  Winslet's funny, passionate, vulnerable performance is her best and one of the best of the year.  I've always thought underneath Carrey's manic, elastic mannerisms lies a darker, somber undercurrent.  The role of Joel required an exact performance that could have easily been under or over played, but Carrey, by buttoning himself down and staying within himself, gives a breathtaking performance.  Kaufman and Co.'s captivating, tragic masterpiece is one of the best films of the year.
