This morning I had to pack up to go to yet ANOTHER camp. I'm staying the night at my house and going to Bellview in the morning. But for some reason I couldn't quite wake up. I ended up being really dumb and just laid there and wrote for an hour or so. I wasn't writing constantly, but what I did write about was Erich. I won't go any farther with that because ... yeah. Public computer. But things were very.... uhmn..... idealistic. I had no worries about "my-story-isn't-plausable" or "would-I-really-do-that" or the general nervousness I get when I write about Erich.  Not that Erich makes me nervous. Quite the contrary. Point in case: this morning. Thinking of him usually makes me less stressed or nervous about things. It just kind of... well... I'm contradicting myself.  Fuck! I'm late for class. Bye.  Sage  PS: Erich I love you!
