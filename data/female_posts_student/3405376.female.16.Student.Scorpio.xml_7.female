Now The Reasons I'm Angry: 1-My mum made me a doctors appointment for my wrist (long story) but she didn't make it for today. Oh No!, that would have been a good idea instead she made it on monday after all my assessments are due in which i need to write copius amounts of information so now i will be able to write nothing therefore fail my assessments! :(  2- The Way a certain boy has been treating me and my friends. If you know me you know who this is, if you don't well you don't want to know. It all started one fateful day when i met friends to see a movie. it was all going fine until mr x started being an absolute bastard to me and my other counterpart. i didn't actually realise at the time he was being mean but i think about it now and realise. We then went up to see Leah in her break and mr x started being quite obviously very mean. i realised but thought he was in a pissy mood (which he was)but i thought about it and realised he'd never been very nice to Leah and Leah had never done anything to him. Whats a girl to do?? 3- I'm angry at my teachers because they set impossible exams that are  made for me to fail. it's only me that fails everyone else passes. it is annoiying the hell out of me. Why do they do that to ,me. i'm a good student. i ocassionally do work and what do i get for it... fail. 4- I'm angry at my school because they gave us really crap drama teachers who can't teach and who waste our time and energy. we need miss Fonteyne to teach us then we may have a chance at passing the HSC in drama. It's sooo screwed.  I'm angry at other people and things but i won't waste any more of your precious time.  Luv D P.S thanks Leah you are my rock!!
