The surroundings in which we lived for a week were a world apart from the sites any tourist would see of Chicago.  Beyond the skyline and beachfront million dollar condos lies the reality of urbanization.  Here, the horrors of poverty, sickness, and violence are everyday realities.  The pains of racial segregation, hungry children, and families ripped apart by tragedy, are enough to make anyone question America’s claim to greatness.  But if you look closely into this picture of Chicago, you will find specks of hope scattered throughout.  They are not readily apparent, and by no means will one or a hundred organizations rid the city of hurt.  But they are trying, and they are working.   	On Wednesday our third full day of work in Chicago, my small group traveled from north side Chicago to the south side community of Englewood.  This community, once a thriving neighborhood, has suffered more tragedy than many of us will ever know.  By the end of year 1991, Englewood was facing its darkest hour; in that year alone it had lost nearly 100 lives to violent murders.  In response, Hal Baskin, a former gang leader became the director for P.E.A.C.E., or People Educated Against Crime in Englewood. After learning this, I realize my memories of Englewood seem to be memories of a ghost town.  Hundreds of lives once present, but forever lost within the limits of this neighborhood.   	My first and most moving experience in Englewood was the sight of the old auditorium.  Painted doorframes were splitting and crumbling beside boarded windows and doors.  Once, I’m sure it stood as a sign of the area’s prosperity and culture, now it simply was waiting to cave in.  We pulled up next to the ornate Saint Stevens Lutheran Church.  Across the street was the parish house with 4 foot letters spelling Peace along the width of the building.  This once dilapidated, gang ridden building now held the headquarters for the Will Feed Kids Café and Peace community center.  The Youth director Ms Anita Dominique, or simply Ms D. lead us into the dark building.   	Though I mentioned the building as being once dilapidated, it is far from renovated.  As Ali and Megan found out, the sink faucets in the bathroom have a bit more character than your normal fixture.  The faucet in the left sink doesn’t work, but if you leave it on, and turn the water on in the right sink, suddenly you realize the left sink is gushing water!  Quirky hardware aside, we settled in to listen to Ms. D.  Her respect in the community is outstanding.  Her involvement in the after school program, Peace community choir, and kid’s café has won her the honor of “neutron” in the gang circuit.  This simply means graffiti was painted on her garage door, indicating no gang activity was to take place in front of her house.  But as you can imagine, in the ruthless world of urban gangs, this gesture showed more respect for one woman than you probably thought a gang member was even capable of.  Ms. D’s respect is fully reciprocated, for she makes it a point to strive to understand the gangs and their network of family.   	After lunch we walked two short blocks to the home of Hal Baskin’s mother, whom owns the land that has become the community garden.  The produce of this garden are used in a cooking class for adults, which cooks food to feed the kids in the kid’s café, who in turn, work in the garden.  We spent the better part of an hour weeding, and moving a mound of dirt.  Though the garden seemed country enough, I was reminded of the neighborhood that surrounded it as I came upon more glass bits and even a broken pair of eyeglasses.  Walking back to the parish, we passed the shoddy houses of Englewood.  Once, they stood as symbols of Midwestern culture and affluence, now their run down yards and peeling paint were just another reminder of Englewood’s tragedies. 	Murder numbers in Englewood still rank in the top five highest of Chicago.  Murders still number into the 40’s and beyond each year.  Why then would I see the Will Feed and Peace program as a provider of hope to the community?  Because I don’t see it as 40 murders a year, I see it as a community that cut its annual murder rate in half.  I see it as a community that is pulling together to make the neighborhood safer.  Because, in Chicago, the hungry can find food, the homeless shelter, and in Englewood, children can find safety from the gang violence on the street.  You can write a hundred letters to congress, run a thousand food drives, and spend a million dollars on improvements, but the problems will still run rampant.  We cannot stop the atrocities of our world.  We will never solve world hunger or find a home for everyone.  I’ve learned that serving for Christ is not about solving the problem; it’s about our willingness to help, our desire to teach, and our passion for growing closer to Christ.
