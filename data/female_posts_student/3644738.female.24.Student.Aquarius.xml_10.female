One of the jokes Chris Rock performed  was that as human beings we have two options in life to be....A: Married and Bored or B: Single and Lonely When you are married and bored you want to kill your partner and when you are single and lonely you want to kill yourself!!!!! A met a couple who where the perfect example of what it is to be "Married and bored"...the dinner conversation went a little something like this...."Oh the children are so funny....Alice (okay you know ain't no black kid called Alice but as I was half listening to the boring conversation I didn't catch the children's names)...Alice said to her younger brother......Give me my Barbie!!....and he said....No you have to say please!!!!!!   So the Alice says........Please can I have my Barbie Please and her brother says..........(Wait for the punch line) ....You're Welcome.........so I'm sitting there thinking this story ain't funny worth a damn....but everyone else is cracking up.......I'm not even going to bore you with the rest but know this....... that was the funniest anecdote they had.
