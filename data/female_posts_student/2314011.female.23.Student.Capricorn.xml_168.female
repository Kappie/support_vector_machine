Its meaning and effect on my life can best be described by the Boy from his blog over the weekend:   Never been much of a Tarantino fan. I always found him as obnoxious as he was pretentious, and he didn't earn any points by casting himself as the obnoxious asshole in all his movies. I hated "Reservoir Dogs" and I thought "Pulp Fiction" was cute for its novelty, but otherwise empty and overblown...except for Uma, who only got 1/2 hour. After she leaves, the movie is dead to me. I didn't even bother to see "Jackie Brown."  (note:  I actually haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, but his was too great a tangent to edit.)   So I scoffed at the hype over 'Kill Bill' and swore I would hate it if I ever wasted enough time to watch it. I saw it as poor, washed-up-Quentin's attempt to cash in on the post-Matrix Kung Fu revival which is so sad it's not even funny...and what's with this Charlie's Angel's rip-off anyway?  (This paragraph I agree with completely)   Well this snobby, elitist Pig was more than happy to be proven wrong.   (respectful snipping)   It didn't take ten minutes for all my venemous hate to become drooling awe. (That doesn't happen often, I assure you.) I was totally blown away by everything about it: the dialogue, the characters (and their names!), the action, the editing, the shameless 70's film referrences, the fucking music! Just dead-serious enough to care about the characters, with enough winking parody to offset its own cartoony violence. Even the damn credits were brilliant! And Uma as The Bride! Uuummmmmaaaaa!!! It's the movie she's needed since Pulp Fiction, and thank god Quentin finally gave her one. (without John Travola!) I was very pleased to learn that Q  U developed the character together way back on that OTHER movie. No wonder she embodies it so well...   (YAY!!!  ME TOOO!)   Anyway, I felt like a whole new fag  (dyke)!  I could not believe how wrong I was, and how much I loved being wrong. How often can you say that you love...LOVE Daryl Hannah and actually mean it? I was a giddy, bouncing fan-boy and not a bit ashamed   After having the same experience, I called him up and we gasped and giggled like little school girls over that scene, this look, ALL THE LINES!!!  It made going to bed after midnight worth it, and when I slept through the alarm again this morning, the omission of morning pages didn't hurt quite as much when I thought of the red cross in Daryl's eye patch.
