Oh wait... that was me.* Mmm... argh on Saturday I'm going in the morning to the Balloon Fiesta thingymejeeby at 5:30am (or something ridiculously early and annoying like that) Er... do you ever find that you don't think about what you say *okay so maybe i'm a bit tooooo loose* Or you just ...speak? (devoid of emotion. yup. the guys in white will be coming soon) Okay, so maybe I am amazed that we can speak! WOW! I'll be ...running away faster than a really really fast speeding bullet with 'wow this is fast' etched on it.
