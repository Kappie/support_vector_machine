We tell our people that theyre smart when u know they are indeed stupid, you tell them theyre hot when they are indeed not, you tell them they can get any guy they want when you know that they indeed cannot. you tell people lies to make them feel better bout themselves but ever though of the fact that lies hurt more than the truth? I mean if they already know an answer to the question and u tell them the opposite of what is true , it doesnt help to hear it. it only makes u feel more shitty at times. If theyre dumb say so, if theyre ugly say so, if they cant get any guy say so, or dont say anything at all. sweet sweet lies, bitter bitter truth.. .u pick   i write so much bullshit on here.. and im a total hypocrite.. u shud hate me..
