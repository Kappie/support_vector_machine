The death of an era. :( I thought it was a good film overall, and I was even inclined to laugh out loud once or twice(no more). I didn't like the ending though.   SPOILER!    In the end the protagonist decides to remain a bear to take care of the little bear he orphaned. I was sitting here in agony, screaming, "No you fool! Turn back into a human! Be human! Bears don't live as long! Nooo!" ... Cotton' pickin' furball. ;)  I had more to talk about, but I plum fergot.
