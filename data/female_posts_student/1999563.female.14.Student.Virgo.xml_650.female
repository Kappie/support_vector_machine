If you haven't noticed I am in quite the horrible mood. :) My mom woke me up early and I am still quite exhausted from having 4 hours of sleep every night in California.  La la la la.  I can't think of much to say exceppttt  I AM GOING HOME TONIGHT!! Yes.  Cannon beach is nice and all but I am obsessed with home. Home home home. I love my home.  Someone was on the interenet [there is only one computer here] and I had to wander around town for about an hour and it was really rainy so I was quite cold so I went into the gelato shop and bought some tea and a cookie. The cookie was really good but the tea was like 50 million degrees so I burnt my tounge! It's sitting outside right now because you aren't supposed to bring drinks into the library.   Last night I was "trying to burn fat" [hahaha] by watching FitTV. It was SO funny. I did this carribean workout and it was soooooo tyring. I thought I was going to die. Hahaha. I am such a wimp when it comes to fitness. But the leader guy kept saying "Excellent, excellent, excellent" I would die of laughter whenever he said that so I would loose my beat and just end up waiting until the next commercail break to continue my "workout"   Fun times!  Woot wooot!  Dudeeee..I can't read my shoutbox so you all should post in the little comment thing.  I willl post late tonight when I am finally HOME!!!  woooohoo!!  Your buddy until the day I die...
