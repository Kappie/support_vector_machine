A single battle lost, but not the war.....good ol' lyrics to my one and only country song I will EVER like. Hehe...I've shamefully admitted it once and for all! Oh well...Today was a pretty good day. School was okay...I got all my homework done before 4:15, so that was nice. Today in spanish I gave a presentation, and like the whole class laughed because I talked really fast or whatever. That is kind of good tho, that I talk fast, because it works to my advantage in spanish. Or not - that may just be some wishful thinking. In math class Tommy decided to create a list titled  The compiled wisdom of Erica Gerstlauer , basically it is just a page of "quotes" that I say, and he finds worth saving. He's funny. Within just 3 hours, he was able to get about 30 quotes from me. That is about one quote every six minutes. Then he asked me for my number, and said he wanted to hang out something this weekend. I told him I didn't know, but he still made me give him my number. Oh well. Today Ethan made me mad. I was talking to Chubbs, asking her something, and then he's like "hey, this is my time" and pushes me out of the way and starts talking to her. He just thinks he can do whatever he wants, and it really makes me mad. Whatever. Oh, I am now Chubbs' secretary. I get to keep track of her life. Score! Well, that was my day!
