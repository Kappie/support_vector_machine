Apparently I'm a missing paper boy who is pissing off people...  2.   Cookie Monster or Elmo?   COOKIE MONSTER!  Elmo is REALLY annoying...  3.   Trains, planes, or automobiles?   Planes and automobiles... never trains... they're too slow... at least the one I went on was...  4.   Pop or Coke?   I say coke... I'm no yankee... I'm a southern texas kinda gal... :-)  5.   Hot tub of foam:  Stick your head in or take the picture?   I took the picture... and I have a 5x7 print of it!  :-D  6.   Would you drive somewhere on a whim?   Well, the only place I have driven on a whim was Canyon Lake... but Ricky and Druck drove all the way to Corpus and back one night... they wanted me to go... but I had something to do the next day... :-\  Next time I'm SO there!  Now, you may be thinking... "What's so 'wacky' about this?"  And fact is, it's totally random... Sorry for the randomness that is this week's Wacky Wednesday!  On another note, everything's good in my world... today a Shakespearean actor from England came to my communications class... he and the troupe are here to perform "Measure for Measure."  Anyhow, he was in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a crazy movie I watched with Melissa)... and sidebar... he seemed the type that Jennifer would like to have a conversation with.  I dunno why I thought that... but I did... :-)  That's it for now... stay tuned for more updates over the weekend... :-D
