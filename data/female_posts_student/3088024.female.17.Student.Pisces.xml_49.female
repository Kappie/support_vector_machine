Ok Well here is what happened...I was at BJU this October and it just so happens I walked up and down the aisle on the bus and made friends with everybody.  Seriously...I made my presence known...which is very unlike me...usually I am quiet and laid back when I go somewhere new but on the BJU trip I EXPLODED...well anyway back to this young lady...One of the people I made friends with was a young woman Jaspa.  Well anyways we were talking on the way home and we exchange addresses and she gave me a picture of herself and I am not in the habit of keeping pictures of myself on myself so I gave her my student ID.  well on the back her picture she wrote the following message "Rusty it was awesome to meet you and get to know you.  You're a pretty cool dude (and a gentleman!)" and then I PROMISED TO WRITE TO HER!!!  well anyways we went home and I put her pic w/ all the other pics I have and everytime I went by it I thought of my promise.  but i am lazy and a sloth and from what I have found did a very "guyish" thing (apparently most men do not like writing letters either).  TODAY HOWEVER i got a letter in the mail from guess who.  thats right JASPA BOUCHARD!  I felt SOOO bad. to make matters worse i open the letter and she says that she has NEVER pursued a young man IN ANY WAY NOT EVEN IN A LETTER!!!  I have caused a young woman to break her principles and I am mildly flattered/embarrassed.  WHAT A JERK!!! well anyways thats it for now
