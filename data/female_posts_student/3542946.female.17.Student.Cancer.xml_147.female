My post of the week: Well as you may know all blogspot sites have been banned at our school, so if you want to get your site unbanned you have to ask Mr. Wood or something. Then he will look at it and see if it's 'suitable' or some crap. I started up  urlLink my own blog  and we will see where that goes. What else is happening gee's. i had a good time at Pablo's the other night. It's a pity you girls didn't turn up. I got drunk and hugged year 9's. Nuffin else is chilling I don't think. We're preparing to overthrow Ms Forster and her reign of terror.
