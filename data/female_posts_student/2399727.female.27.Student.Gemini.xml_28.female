Why doesn't God step in where a young child is being physically or sexually abused?  Why doesn't he cure that 22-year-old woman's terminal breast cancer, or help the young man who is suffering from MS?    Some very kind theologians and philosophers have reminded me of the principle of Free Will, a gift to us that allows us to be the captains in our own lives.  Our lives are not predestined.  We can choose when and what we do, how we do it, why we do it.  We can actively, intellectually turns towards God (our Creator or however you recognize this entity in your own life), or we can rely on our own talents and resources to propel us along life's paths.  Because of the gift of freedom that we have, the young child who is abused is at the mercy of his parent's bad use of Free Will.  The diagnosis of serious diseases is a result of the existence of evil in our world, and human sin is the cause of the presence of this evil.    So, God can do anything but doesn't because he loves us enough to make our own choices about things.  Seems complicated but as mortals, there's only so much we can see of the big picture.  Hopefully all will be made clear on the other side.  Until then, we have to bear our trials as best as we can and offer them up.  Someone told me that there's no greater prayer than that of a suffering servant.  Let's hope that is true.  Gottfried Wagner's talk yesterday was interesting.  Part two is this afternoon.  It seems incredible to me that he and his family have such differing, splintering opinions on their family's dynasty.  He completely disagrees with the sanitization of their family name, believing that covering up the past is almost as bad as the family's involvement in the Third Reich in the first place.  Family reunions must be particularly interesting.  More to come...
