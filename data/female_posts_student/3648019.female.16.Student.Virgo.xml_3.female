WTF IS UP WITH THAT?)...got some new Manga art books...woo hoo! I love my life (huggles self) Yay!  I now have no more school until 7 September of this year. Summer is upon me like the tanning lotion...I am so hitting the beach this summer. I want to swim a lot more than last year.  I also want to get started on a longer-running doujinshi (hence the new Manga art books!) and really get a head start on my language arts courses. Francias, anyone? (In the middle of backwoods Quebec, our cottage resides. They don't speak French. They speak Quebecois. It's like Hicksville, Quebec.) And German. I need to do better next year.  Oh, the humanity... Ciao!
