I'll probably post several times over the summer, especially about the SMITE trip.  Please, keep all the comments nice, and please leave your real name.  Thanks.  Quick shout out to my Bahamas girls.  I love you all so much!  We're gonna have a blast! Let's make it an INCREDIBLE trip, not a long one.  lol  Eve- You crack me up! We're gonna have a blast together! Be careful not to sleep with a quacking duck...it'll scare you.  lol. Thanks for always adding your random humor to everything!  Emily- You are my best friend so you will keep me sane.  I'm so glad we're both going to Bahamas!  We have so many memories, so let's add a bunch of great memories after this summer! Thanks for always being there.  Angela- I don't know you very well, but I know that after this summer we'll be better friends.  You're really cool and I can't wait! It's gonna be so much fun!  Rebecca- I have way too much fun with you! I can tell you anything and everything.  Our "dances" are hilarious.  Let's see how many we add after Bahamas (yes I know there will be many) and we'll work out a routine at BJ. haha.  I can't wait to spend 2 weeks with you! It's gonna be a blast!  Amanda- Girl, I love you so much! I'm looking foward to Bahamas so much! We have had so much fun together so I know this will be great! (no more fights lol)  You're awesome!  Miss Syr- Thanks for going on the trip with us! I'm looking foward to spending time with you.  Thank you for helping us have close unity.    With all that- SMITE is awesome! I can't wait.  Love all you girls!
