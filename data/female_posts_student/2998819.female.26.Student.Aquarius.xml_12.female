Then I was on my way home when my car ended up at my training lake.  It was the best run I have had in a long time.  I was in the zone the whole time until one guy yelled you are slowing down, so I picked up the pace a little and my legs were feeling great.  I could have done more than 3.3 but since I already ran earlier today I didn't' want to push it.  I ran 3.3 in 29.44 according to runnersworld.com that's a 9:01 min/mile and I was running at a 6.66 miles/hour.  I have never ran that fast in my life!  Man did it feel great.   Happy running
