I was like"WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Speaking of which, on  urlLink www.albinoblacksheep.com  there is this thing called "Weeee!!" aka Gonads and Strife. It is SOOOO freakin' hilarious and I laughed my @$$ off! Watch it. There is really no point to it, but it is funny just to hear what this thing says.  "WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!"  Also, there is one called "Bukkake" it's so STUPID but yet sooooooo funny when it's like 2 AM and you are fighting sleep. In one part it talks about Nagasaki, which was not funny, but sombering, but then later it gets dumb again. LOL. BUKAKKE!!!  I like bukakke! I like bukakke! I like bukakke!!   urlLink  !@#$   bukakke!!  urlLink  !@#$      bukakke!!!   Lol. Sorry. I'm sooooo tired. We ran for an hour and 10 minutes today nonstop (mostly) and I'm exhausted. But at least The Mile will be SOOO easy next year.  I'm tired. I talked to Jon today. I met him at band camp!!  (Jackie, please IM me if you get this. I have stuff to tell you....)  My baby is doing GREAT!! It's a boy!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!! (My friend Jackie thought it would be a girl! Nope!! I don't know what I'll name him!)  Eleftheria girls, IM me for the whole thing. LOL!
