If some one says some thing, then we assume that they mean it *and that I can spell assume* We expect oxygen to be in the air tomorrow, we take it for granted that the world will be there tomorrow. We expect this web page to be here tomorrow, maybe we're assume, expecting whatever too much. Haven't you ever had it where some thing isn't there and you just accept that it's gone with a slight shock. We need to stop assuming things, if you take things for granted then you don't truely appreciate every thing around you. Life, how easily that can be taken for granted. What if it was taken away suddenly? I just think it's amazing to think that we're alive, we're on a planet and we're eating the world's food supply, that if equally shared out could fead the whole world. Open your eyes and unlock your brain.
