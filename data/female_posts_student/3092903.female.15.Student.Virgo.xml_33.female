Okay, when I'm home by myself, its not that boring because I'm used to being an only child and entertaining myself somehow. So, I was just doing my normal stupid stuff while listening to music and I thought, hey I wonder if I can still do a heel stretch, which is this little cheerleading thing you do when you fly and you hold your heel above your head. It's a fun stretch for the back of you thigh, so I did it like twice and I was like, HOLY SHIT, i'm still pretty flexible even though I havent been stretching everyday. So then I thought to myself, "I bet if you really stretch out good you can get your leg to go up really high." so I did it, I got down in a split and was really stretching my legs out good and I was ready to do it. So I pulled my leg up and..crack CRACK crack SNAP crack!..Holy Shit, that didnt feel too good..Maybe I wont do that anymore tonight. So I'm feelin it a little, and I went to bed about two and I wake up to go babysit for the kids and I try to get up and their is this sharp pain in my ass at the top of my thigh. It hurt so bad, I just fell back to sleep and didnt worry about taking a bath. When I finally got up I brushed my teeth and washed my face and I got REALLY light headed, like worse than when I passed out on those stack of chairs at Thespian Conference. I could only see blue splotches in my eyes and I was trying to find the couch, so I bumped into a chair, tripped over all this shit in my living room and fell into the side of the couch and pulled myself up and i was out. Ho-oh-oh-leeee shit. So I had to walk around like I had hip replacement surgery today, but I did get to lay out while making money, thats always a plus. Oh my gosh, I met this really really hott guy the other night. He was SO nice ( thats  definitely refreshing...). See, I knew who he was, but I had never met him before. So I am definitely going to have to see what he's all about. Well, I have to go get ready for this golf thing tomorrow..I dont think it will be any fun for some reason, and that reason is  i'm probably right.
