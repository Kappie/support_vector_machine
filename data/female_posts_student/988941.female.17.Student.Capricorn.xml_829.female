It's a bit of the Irish about a man called Jack who made a deal with the devil, making the Jack-o-lantern - used to be in a turnip but the USA decided it would be better to use pumpkins as there were more of them. Trick-or-treating comes from Celts and was actually to give food to the needy on 2nd November in return for giving prayers to the dead on their path to heaven. It is the Celtic New Year as the summer officaly ends, acording to the Celts in 5 BC. There really isn't much in it at all. I'm sorry to be the evil and unsprited one, but I refuse to be sucked into this. Children running around wearing stupid masks  threatening  people to give them sweets which are going to make them fat. Old people have a terrible time and every year you read about an old lady somewhere going to hospital or having her house attacked. I don't care how great it is to dress up and run around looking silly, you can do that any day of the week in my house and get away with it, come on round, it will be a ball.
