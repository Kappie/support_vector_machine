Dang, was it exciting! (All primary school mates)   Mr Lee  also made a guest appearance in my dream. It was short. He knocked his nose against the office door knob and started crying in front of his students.   The last chunk of my dream was actually a nightmare. HuiYing in particular, a few 4B1-ians, a coupla' celebrities and I signed up for a course to be oppressed by the  Orcs  from  Lord of The Rings . We had to go through a series of excruciating torments - being hung on metal chains high up in the air, on top of huge red beds of coals that blazed and quivered with molten fury. We competed in threes. The person who could do the best flops, twists and turns in the air would win the praise of the Orcs. The other 2 who lost were left to burn. I was up against HuiYing and  Emma Watson  (Hermione). I was left to be burnt. It's all good though. Dying  together  with Emma Watson. What more can I ask for?   Spell of the day:    Expelliarmus  (ex-pel-ee-AR-mus) Causes opponent's weapon to fly out of their hand.
