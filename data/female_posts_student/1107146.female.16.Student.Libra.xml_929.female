Mono is not pretty.  I'm not quite sure how active I'm going to be on the blog, but stay tuned.  I will be back eventually.  I'm bored.  Call me at lunch on school days to cheer me up.  I just hope I don't land in the hospital...the doctor said it was a very real possibility.  Oh, I'm going to be in a home bound program for a while.  Even when I come back it's only going to be partial days.  I gotta go.  Even playing my piano wears me out, so I'm gonna go sleep for a couple of hours.  See you guys later, I hope.  Oh, and I can't go on Sonshine Retreat this weekend.  I'm NOT a happy person.
