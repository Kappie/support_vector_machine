I got a B on my Health exam, a C on my English exam, a B on my Science exam, an A on my band exam, a F on my Geometry exam, and a 3 1/2 on my Spanish exam. That is just on the oral part, I don't know what I got on the AlphaSmart.   Matthew: I just want to let you know that the play was good. Even though I had to use my script. I almost fell on some step thing. But it was ok, I caught myself. It was a graceful fall. I don't know if Cassie told you this yet or not but I have decided what I want to be in the next Hal McCuen play that Morgan signs up for. If Cassie told you then you don't have to read this but if she didn't then you have to read it. Do you remember the play we did when I was the evil fairy Tamika and that guy came in during the performance and then walked out? Well I have decided that I want to be a person that comes into Don Broyd Hall because I am lost and I need directions. And I get pulled into the story. Cassie will have to tell you all the details but that is my character, sorry about the misspelling.    Cassie: I still can't seem to be able to post comments on your family one but I will try again.
