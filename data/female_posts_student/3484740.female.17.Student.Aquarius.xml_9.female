My boss actually talked to the guy and everything, and we had a huge blow out at my house...and what not. I'm not going to go into any details, I don't believe its a good thing for me to do that anyway. So...perhaps one day soon I can write them all down. I don't know what is going to happen in the future...but we'll just have to wait and see like everything else.
