Aside from this, I've developed a heavy addiction to my Switchfoot Cd.  I think they could lock me away somewhere with maybe a bag of pretzels and a my Switchfoot Cd and I wouldn't really complain.   Ok, I would.  But thats only because I'm hoplessly complain-ful and not because butter pretzels and Switch aren't enough.   these abundant skies, these abundant skies, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah .  Practice was somewhat pointless today.  I wasn't in any of the scenes so it was mostly sitting around and being amazed and depressed by the greatness and extreme suckiness of the various people we've got in this thing.  I imagine Charlie and Melissa will really be the only two carrying the entire show.  I expect you all to be there anyhow, by the way.  If nothing else, me on a stepstool will certainly be amusing.  xo. ker.
