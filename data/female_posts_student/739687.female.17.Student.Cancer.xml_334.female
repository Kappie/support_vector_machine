Rofl...sad, but true.  Some day my life will catch up with me...and I will be one screwed little chiquita.  That will suck. If god be willing however...it won't ever occur.  I was a bitch in 8th grade. Hahaha boy oh boy was I a little bitch. I was a good kid, but I was a bitch. I found a bunch of old conversations I had with people. I was blunt...ridiculously blunt. I'm glad I've acquired a bit more tact in the past 3/4 yrs. I was bold too...a fearless person...if I wanted something, I went straight for it. I wish I could be that bold again. I wonder what happened. Well I guess I went through a phase where I lost that. I'm getting it back...tactfully now, of course.  I am such a bad kid. Couldn't really call me a kid though. I realized the other day that one of my ex's never realized how young I was. I mean, he knew, but I guess it never really hit him until I was joking about having 3 months until I'm finally 17. Then he was like 'omg. you ARE young.' Good. Maybe he'll go throw himself off of a bridge. I wish he would, stupid bastard. At least I'd never have to deal with him again. :)  My God ADD sucks. I CAN'T FOCUS FOR MY LIFE.  I swear...the most random people in the world hate my guts. It's 99.999% of the time people I don't know...or I'm somehow associated to them through other people, but I never actually talk to them. And the other .001% that hates me and actually knows me...well, honestly I can't think of anyone off the top of my head...but I would have had to do something really f-ing stupid. Or they are a bunch of pricks.  I don't mean to sound like I'm perfect and if you know he you wouldn't hate me...because who knows. I'm just saying that it makes no sense.  Oh, and a good number of people who hate me...hate me because of stupid rumors and stuff. Hahahaha they are the ones I'd love to beat senseless...because they have to be stupid to care about a bunch of made up shit.  Oh...and 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of them are girls.  Ahh well...the attention and conflict FUELS me. rofl...bring it.  Can't focus can't focus...gahhhh.  Alright crazies...enough for today.
