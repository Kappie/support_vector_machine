[note: they suck at writing songs. sorry guys.]  so. i have plans for tonight. i'm so happy. with my lovers: vanessa and em. they rock. we're going to tim horton's... but no one else is gonna be out cuz chelsey's having a party... and everyone else is invited.  ok so next weekend is gonna be sweet.
