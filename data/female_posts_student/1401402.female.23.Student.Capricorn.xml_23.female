Harvey, helped me finish washing my car. Within a flash I thought I saw someone I've been waitting for. This person really looked like you. The hair cut, buff, looks, except for one thing I didnt recognized the car that the person was in. He stop and stared at me for a while. I coulnt really see because I didnt have my contact lens on.  Hey IBM dude, if your still reading this, the dude you saw washing my car wasnt who you thought it was. Please do not take it the wrong way. I've always be honest with you and always will be. But it cant be you!!! Why would you drive 47 miles just to spy on me?  And without a phone call? Come on its impossible. It couldnt have been you and it will never be you RIGHT?
