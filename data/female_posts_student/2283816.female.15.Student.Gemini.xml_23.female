Love, MOOOOOO-om! *beep*  I checked out RENT from the library. In case you didn't already know, RENT is a Broadway musical that won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in the late 90s. There are these people called RENTheads who love it... and many of them happen to love Alias. So naturally I was curious. I checked it out, and it's kinda bizzare. But I'm growing to like it. "Seasons of Love" and "Tango: Maureen" are two of my favorites. It's kind of a PG-13 play, if you ask me.   Anyway - I have to leave for my grandma's before lunch, so I'm doing all this now because I have to clean the bathroom when I get home (thrill).   There's a lady at our church - I don't know how many of you have noticed her. I call her the Hat Lady. This name is rather self-explanatory. She's a shorter woman with gray hair, pink lipstick, a nice smile, bright dresses, and a HAT to match every single one of them. Her husband is apparently some guy that owns a bank. So I suppose she has enough money to buy all these hats. That's going to be me someday. You watch.  Being Catholic reminds me of being Italian or German or something - it's ethnic in its own little way. We're good little children who sit and get bored during church and eat Cheerios. Then we are sent to Catholic school where we have insane teachers, which I guess is better than having insane nuns. Just ask my mother sometime. They're all crazy. And then we become bad boys and girls when we grow up because we have been stilted and can't get our nervous energy out. Then we see therapists. Then we become therapists. It's a cycle.  I swear, our teachers really are insane. My mother claims you have to be insane to teach junior high.   Like Mrs. Kirby. Good lord. She's a nice woman, but can she stay on topic? Can she focus on one thing?? *sigh* And is it really necessary to be tan at the age of 50+? Or wear sandals all the time or try to look younger? I don't know. I just don't know.  Mrs. Quinn just needs to retire. Ack.   I don't know, they all just get progressively stranger.   *puts off typing up her epilogue* It's gonna suck. Accccccccck.   There's a Harry Potter article in Girl's Life. I'm trying to read it but I'm typing all this stuff so I'm getting distracted. But I like to type. The siblings won't go away and I have lost my comic touch temporarily. It's Mrs. Kirby's fault.  And I can't figure out why the font is so small on the main page. I'm going to try and fix it.   Kiss me goodbye, y'all.
