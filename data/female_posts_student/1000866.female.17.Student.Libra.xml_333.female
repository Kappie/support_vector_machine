She's so nice. :) It was totally out of the way, but they drove me home anyway. Actually...Alex drove. haha, he's a good driver. We just played music again today. Supposedly Wednesday we're actually going to work on some drill. I highly doubt that'll happen, but if it did, that would be pretty nifty. Anyway, I'm going to go sleep now I think...  My brother's friends are here again though. Oh joy. :\
