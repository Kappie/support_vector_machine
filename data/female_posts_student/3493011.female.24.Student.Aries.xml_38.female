Terence is back... so for the past week, we have been spending lotsa time together... went shopping for my new trainers (sign up for gym), it isn't exactly red but there are strips of red on the shoes so I'm satisfied with the cheap buy ($45) kids size somemore hahhahahah... I've bought a black jacket and Terence got for me the red one... both are amazingly value for money...  It has been a crazy first week... working more hours and juggling my classes (one day week wooo hoo) as well as trying to complete my thesis chapter 1..that is draining my soul away... I'm starting  to lose the momentum of my thesis project.. the yucky feeling is edging in slowly and I'm dragging my feet to complete my chapters... I sense a tension between my supervisor and me...cos she has extremely high stds.. now in my fourth year, I'm finding it harder to make her mark... Praying to God for better working relationship...  My other subjects are interesting: Material culture and Postcolonial concerns, Postmodern Theories. The former consists of fieldtrips to museums, herbie, state lib. etc etc.. sounds fun yah.. I can't wait for the trips even though I went to some of the places alreadi... The latter is more theoretical... readings on Orientalism and spaces of knowledge...centering on China as the oppostional culture to the West... the mystification of China.... Actually after goin through the readings, I'm kinda taken aback by the "chimness" of the course, juz hope I manage to survive hahhahahaha This semester I'm dealing with 2 disciplines tt ain't my forte.. so muz wrk harder... but seriously, I find it hard to accomplish... distractions
