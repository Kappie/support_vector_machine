It's quite ironic for them to realize the mere incidence of a student passing her 20 peso bill and ONLY RECEIVING 15.50 instead of the so called promulgated law of only 4.50 with having to pass around 16.50. Stupid it may be but their foolishness crawls up in my nerves that i may want to scram down the jeepney and yell at that stupid driver in may dismay.  But whatever their intention is.. THEY SUCK!
