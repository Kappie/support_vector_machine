I need to talk to Arik...so badly...I just realized I can't talk to anyone else about all of this...and I've been holding all the tears back...until now. I let them all fall. Okay I admit....I dont have the greatest life...I dont have that many friends...and most of the friends I have...I cant talk to. I've always been able to talk to Arik...and now...when I need him the most...I can't and...*sigh* I dunno...I just needed to write a little of this out...cuz...yeah...writing always helps me...  My mom said I couldn't even talk to her...shes under so much stress and can't handle mine also. I've always been able to talk to her bout everything....its weird...but we do talk. I think the only thing shes told me lately is that I need him...to talk to...Grandpa just get better...please...so we dont have to be under so much stress...and...I wont feel like this...dont worry Im not depressed...I  am staying far away from that....last winter was enough for me...Im not goin that far down again...I realize now....life goes on...and you dont need to die over something stupid...so im being strong in everyway that I can...but im a softie...and cry alot. I think im gonna go watch my all time favorite movie, Backdraft, now....so I can bawl at the end....and feel good about it...and if anyones willing to talk to me...or just listen...call me anytime day or night...i wont care. I need to talk to someone. Arik probably more than anyone...but still i wouldnt mind a phone call...  Heh. I feel like I sound all needy n crap. And needy can get annoying...ive learned from that....so yeah...its just that i needed to write what I felt...and I did....so yeah...sorry for anything /  everything. Blah. Someone gets angry about like everything I write so I don't even know why I do it....for my own good...yes thats it...for me. My feelings....my thoughts....my heart.  Im Out.  -Tara
