He called me though around 12:15 and we talked till about 3 something. So that made up for not seeing him. I got a letter from band, band camp starts August 2. Which really sucks, but I'll be okay. Anyways I get to see I, Robot. Yayness. I'm going to wake up early tomorrow to mow the front yard, so I can get some money. Then Saturday I'm going shopping. I wonder if we can eat lunch there. I want to go to China Garden. Eating with chopsticks rocks my socks. It's fun LOL.        Anyways I've been thinking about this and this is my opinion. I think we make guys cheat. Seriously, this is what you see sometimes. A guy that has a girlfriend, then another girl comes along and wants to hook up with this guy. Then the guy is like I have a girlfriend, and then the girl says, So? What's that got to do? I just think that is plain nutty. Cause I think every girl wants a trustworthy boyfriend and honest one, so when you do that, you screw with their train of thought. Guys are simple yet complex. Anyways if you make that dude cheat on his girlfriend with you, what makes you think he won't just cheat on you to? Seriously now. I've seen this posted on gurl.com message boards, and it just makes me sick. I know Tregory won't do anything to hurt me or meant to at least. (You know guys) I'm just helplessly, completely, undeniabley, in love with the boy. We've already talked about marriage and kids. I mean seriously, I really do not think will get married, but that would be cool. I just want this to last as long as possible. It's been 3 months and 3 weeks and 3 days. HAHA, thats funny. Anyways...I LOVE HIM!!!! Teeheehee...can't wait to see him tomorrow.      Love Cherry Loves Tregory Love
