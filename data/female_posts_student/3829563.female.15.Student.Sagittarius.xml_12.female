Well somebody told me that you had a girlfriend that looked like a boyfriend that I had in february of last year...  yeah, happy day.   -------------- Now to the Purpose of this Post ----------------  My H. (my Bass Teacher) has been teaching me how to make bass lines in a very strange way.  I still do not get how you figure out all the notes in certain chords, but I am guessing you can help me a bit with that.  Then I just use the notes in the chord my own little groovy way.  Because Bassists are very groovy you know.  So assignment for the time being.  Get the Groove.  And practice songs other than previously assigned by Mr. H.  Speaking of which, songs I want to play.  *shrugs*  I just want to get the groove you know
