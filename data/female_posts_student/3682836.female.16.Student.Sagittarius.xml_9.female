Today pissed me off. I just love being called a bitch so whoever reads this.. just remember it. Reese's info is right.. I pry dont like u either" remember that. If your going to be an ass to me.. I am going to be one too. I hate some people. Actually.. I dont hate. I just get mad at people. I guess I am self centered..  a bitch. I mean shit.. after you get called it for so long by so many people, it must be true right? yeah fuck u too mike. People trying to turn me against the one person in the world left for me to fucking trust.. why? WHY would u do that? It wouldnt ever work.. I love her like my own family..  I dont like you at all. My personality is the opposite of most peoples.. And sometimes I come out all wrong. But fuck it all. For once I want to go a day where I can let everything go.. all the shit thats happened  everything in my past..  my worries about my mom GO.. just 24 hours. Thats it. It will never happen. I have too much to let go of.. too many memories that I can never forget.. Its too much to even type out on this thing..  whoever is reading it.. pry dosnt care anyways.    Why do I get like this? In these depression moods.. I dont get it.. I guess its just who I am. I cant really control it. And some people think I am feeling sorry for myself.. WELL THEY CAN GO FUCK MY ASS (reeses words) because if they are reading this.. I hate you. I wish you knew the first thing about me.. then you'd know all this shit and wouldnt have to be reading a BLOG to find out about my past. HAHA. ~ASHLY~
