Sad, haha.I'm just trying  to not think about that jazz audition at all. I don't even want to see what spot I got in jazz band. I assume I made jazz band at least because not enough trumpets tried out. It's kind of weird actually. There will be like no trumpets for Jazz Lab because so few tried out. It's usually that we have way too many but eh. I'm thinking I got 3rd in jazz band maybe. They wouldn't put me on second again because I can't solo nor do I want to and Nathan's probably going to be on first. I mean, he probably should be in JSO, but they're going to want him to play lead for jazz band.   Blah blah blah. I need to pick up stuff in my room and I really don't want to. I'm so lazy. I don't want to do my math homework either. I just want to sleep. sleep sleep sleep.   And stalker boy is still stalking and it's getting worse. It's really aggravating. I mean, he's a nice kid and all but really, GIVE IT A REST! Pleaseeee!!!!! It's been three years, aren't you bored?? I don't get it either, why me? It's not like I'm pretty, smart, talented, etc. Oh well, I give up. Farewell kiddies.
