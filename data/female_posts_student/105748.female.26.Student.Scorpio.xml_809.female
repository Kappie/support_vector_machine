Anyway, can you see the disparity between Brian's webcam and mine?  It sucks, doesn't it?  Which is why I ordered Logitech's QuickCam 4000 the other night.  I can't wait until it comes!  Man, can you imagine a webcam with 1.3 megapixels and digital zoom and a built-in mic?  It has better features than my Cybershot!  Whoa!!
