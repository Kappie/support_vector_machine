Highlights of my week:      Wednesday- Went to the beach with Debra and Tessa. No run-ins with Mr.Expose Myself. Unfortunate run-ins with druggies who are supposedly on tethers. For dinner, Station with the Mom.       Thursday- Went to Jenna's, attempted to eat all of her food. Favored the cheese puffs especially. To demonstrate this point, drew stick figure holding giant cheese puff on driveway with chalk, which proclaimed:  "I loves me my cheetos!"  .        Friday- Went to Lauren's (aka Andy the Egg Head, or at least according to Debra) to watch movies. After  My Best Friend's Wedding , so-journed to Debra's, watched Danielle, ate dinner, and went to 7/11. Not to mention hot tubbed.      Yes, that was my past 3 days. What's planned for today?         Get Kayle's present     Quench craving for Dominoes buffalo wings     It may be a short list, but at least its organized.
