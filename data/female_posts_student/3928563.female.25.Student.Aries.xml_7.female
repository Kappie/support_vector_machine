       
       Poppy here:  I recently attended a *ahem*  stimulating  workshop by Patrick Califia:  How to Top (for people who usually don't) . As advertised, the evening was all about topping, or dominating, for beginners. Sign me up! I'm a complete beginner at BDSM--at least, as much as your average adventurous 20-something can be.  First, some definitions:  urlLink BDSM  is a blanket term for lots of kinds of erotic power play that doesn't fit under the banner of conventional sex. Real BDSM is always  consensual  and relies on open communication and clear limits. The letters stand for  b ondage and  d iscipline--where one person is under physical restraint like handcuffs or ropes,  d ominance and  s ubmission--where one person agrees to put themselves in the control of another (usually, to obey their orders), and  s adism and  m asochism--where one person receives pain from another. Common, but not universal, shorthand for the participants:  top  for the person with the bullhorn, whip, or key to the handcuffs, and  bottom  for their happily tormented partner.   Patrick, a longtime lesbian/SM/transsexual activist and writer, (buy his  urlLink books !) was a wonderful, accessible celebrity presenting to an open and friendly audience. Of course, the audience was at least half bottoms, so they were ready to believe and/or obey just about anything he said ;)    Despite the cozy atmosphere, I found the presentation a bit intimidating. Mostly it was because I was an outsider, someone who isn't yet into the BDSM scene and doesn't have a partner to play with. BDSM encompasses so many different kinds of people that get off on so many different kinds of things! There are so many rules, etiquettes, and caveats to remember! Of course, they're all in place to safeguard people who are boldly going where your average couple doesn't. Indeed, because they need to think so much about consent, power, and control, BDSMers can teach the vanilla world a LOT about safety, communication, and self-knowledge.   So, I imagine you're wondering what great tips Patrick had about topping:  First of all, you gotta establish a  persona . You need an attitude and you need good clothes to get you in that topping mood.  Second, you can't top if your heart's not in it. Ask yourself what  you  will get out of the scene. An orgasm? A manicure? A sense of humble satisfaction that you showed your partner a good time?  Third,  negotiate  with your bottom BEFOREHAND. Don't wait till everyone's naked to find out that not only does your new parter HATE your fetish, he won't give you head either. Patrick suggested making a list of things you each need, things you like, and things you just won't do. That way you won't be tempted to go beyond your comfort zone.  Fourth, decide how you're going to  transition  into the sexual part of a scene. You've got the flirting, the buildup, the negotiation, and then this kinda wonky grey area where both of you are just kind of sitting, looking at each other. As the top, it's your responsibility to get the party started (and to decide when it's over, if your bottom doesn't use a safeword first). Anyways, decide on some action that shows YOU'RE in control, order them to take off their clothes, and away you go.  Fifth, and most important,  safety first . Don't forget to establish  urlLink safewords , and don't forget the keys to your handcuffs! For more about BDSM safety, check out this great intro by Jay Wiseman and Lady Green:  urlLink BDSM Tip Sheet for Beginners .  The presentation was more about attitude and planning than specific tips. Patrick suggested being flexible and lighthearted, and pointed out that if anything goes wrong, you can blame the bottom for it and they'll be happy to take their punishment!  I guess the biggest lesson _I_ learned that evening is that for right now, I'm so much more attracted to being a bottom. All that persona stuff sounds like WORK. Why be in control when you could be deliciously in someone else's power? Good thing there are a few people out there that don't feel the same way, and can indulge me in my tastes. God bless diversity!  -------------------------------  There are more BDSM resources out there than you can shake a stick at.
