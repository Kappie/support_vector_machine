The Rangers victory handcuffs the A's dropping them to 4 1/2 games back.  Things stayed fairly even early on, both teams scoringtwo in the 3rd. Texas got two men in on an Eric Young double. Oakland answered right back in the bottom half with an Eric Byrnes 2 run homer to right-center.  The A's appeared to take charge in the 5th when byrnes would again do something with his bat, hitting a sac fly to center scoring Scutaro. That wouldn't last long as the Ranger would break out the sticks, and getfive runs in the 6th. Michael Young would lead off with a single, Soriano would be sat down looking, Texiera would line out to Crosby and then the fun would really start. Brian Jordan would single to left moving Young to third, and then the first run would score after a Blalock single placing men at first and third. Gary Matthews would follow up with a single scoring Jordan from third and moving Blalock to second. Kevin Mench wouldcap the 6th inning parade with one of his own around the bases. Rod Barajas would double and Eric Young would walk, but shame shame on Michael Young for popping up to end the inning he started off with a lead off single.  Texas would add another run for insurance in the 8th inning, but it wasn't needed as the A's failed to put any of their own on the board for the remainder of the game.  Luckily for the A's its only the end of July and they've got two months to erase a 4 1/2 game gap. They just might want to start with their next two games.
