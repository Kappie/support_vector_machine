No, I called his house and i figured right and he's still asleep so now it's the question of whether or not i should eat lunch here at home or wait to see if he gets up thinking "Wait im supposed to be doing something this weekend" According to his mom he was up playin videe games all night and into this morning... I'm kinda thinking he forgot about today and was sucked into game mode.... and so now here I am again with nothing to go do, I've already played nes that got borring... I hate the summer heat.. i mean i guess it wouldnt be so bad if i didnt have to stand out in it everyday... yuck* its nice for those who can enjoy the summer and swim all day and lay out in the sun and not break out into a soaking sweat.. *sigh* im glad this my last year of band otherwise I thnk i would've quit by now... Hmm.. this has been yet another waste of a day and then joy summer band starts up tomorrow from 8-4pm everyday.. I hope i get over this crap ive got cause i feel really crappy and i have to get rid of it so that my voice can come back... not a good thing to be in band and then loose your voice... but newho my stomaches rumbling and growling now.. and i still dont know what i should do..?       GRRRRR!!!!! sry that was my stomache
