But there isn't anything bad in it..it just has a bad title. Oh well.  I am so tired and sore. I didn't get much sleep last night and when I woke up I couldn't move my neck to the right. Haha. It hurts really bad.  Tonight I might not have to go to youth group which is nice because everyone is at camp so no one would be there. I bet my mom will make me go anyways. It's good for me... *rolls eyes*  Hmm. I can't think of much more to say so I will be leaving now!!  Laura
