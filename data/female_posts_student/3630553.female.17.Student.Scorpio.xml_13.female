And until now, whenever it crosses my mind, it still creeps me out.  I can’t remember my age but I think I was around 6 or 7 when it happened. I woke up at around three o’clock in the morning, and guess where I found myself? At the bathroom! I was sleeping in the bathroom floor! And I had absolutely no idea how I got there nor how long I’ve slept there. All I know is that the night before, I went straight to my bed and fell asleep with the blanket covered on me. It was weird. Really weird.  The floor was dry and cold and, as I consciously opened my eyes, I was calm for a while. Then after a few seconds, I was completely awake and startled. The coldness of the bathroom, and the realization of having no clue on how I got there, started to give me the Goosebumps. I started to pinch myself, thinking that maybe it was just a dream. But it was no dream. I really was sleeping there!  I went out of the bathroom - shaking. I didn’t want to scream but deep inside I was overflowing from fear. The dawn was very quite that I could even hear the lizards’ tsktsk out on the corners. And do you want to know what freaked me even more? All the lights of the house from my bedroom leading to the bathroom were turned on! I ran all the way to my parents’ room and woke my mother up, telling her what happened.   That morning, after breakfast, everyone in the house gave me a hypothetical explanation – “You probably had a sleepwalk.”
