Some good scenes - especially the meat locker scene - and Burgess Meredith is good as a caricature of a grizzled old trainer, but really left me cold.  Sequels were even worse.  Thanks for the encouragement, Net.  My Tuesdays and Wednesdays are shot for the next 3-4 months!  I roll home 12 or 1am.  I'm really dragging butt this morning!  I agree, GREEN MILE was excellent!  Very powerful visuals.  I kinda saw the "Jesus" character as more a force of nature (I think Hanks even used that line) than as Christ-like, but sometimes I'm too literal in my interpretations.
