It's nothing special to you, but to me it's the worl I judge people too quickly, I say things too fast Sometimes I'll just sit and watch, and do you know what I learned? No one feels, everyone just talks Achieve happiness, I once read Stretch like a cat on a Sunday Morning, laugh like a baby in it's mother's arms Love like it's the movies, the book said ...I'm workin on it
