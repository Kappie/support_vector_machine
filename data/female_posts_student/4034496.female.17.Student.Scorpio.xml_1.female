Although I try to respect other people's opinions on issues like these, this is one instance where I come so close to saying, "NO! Your opinion is wrong!" I don't hold people's opinions on issues against them (at least, I try not to), but what I really want to say to them is, "Common grandpa, get with the times." Sure, it says in the  Bible  to marry the opposite sex or whatever, and being a Christian, I do believe what the  Bible  says, but, you have to look at what the  Bible  says in context, and remember that it was written about a zillion years ago. So, don't take this blog too seriously, I'm trying not to.  These days, the fabulousness of the gays is hard to contain. At no other time in the history of humanity have gay rights been the focus of so much attention in the media. You'd think this would happen sooner, given the popularity of musical theatre. There has been so much accomplishment in terms of achieving equality for gay people around the world. Gay people can now be free of discrimination, free of prejudice in hair salons around the country. People finally understand the fear, the terror gays/lesbians face when confronted with enlarged pores. Many gay people compare this fight for equal rights and non-discrimination to that of African-Americans.   However, members of the African-American community have not taken this comparison kindly. Someone said, "The experience is not the same." I take this to mean that the discrimination that gays face is not the same as that of African-Americans primarily (as it was claimed) because gay people can "choose" not to be gay. I don't know what it is like to be black, or gay, but this I picked up somewhere: In 1998, when Matthew Shephard confided to two men that he was gay, they deceived him into leaving with them in their car. He was robbed, brutally beaten, tied to a fence and left for dead. He died several days later.  If it were a choice, I think all these hundreds and thousands of people would have chosen not to suffer, face hardship, lose friends and family, their jobs and their lives. In my opinion, if gays/lesbians compare themselves with African-Americans, it's probably only because they've seen what they have achieved and that's what they want for themselves.  But that's only my opinion, it could be wrong.
