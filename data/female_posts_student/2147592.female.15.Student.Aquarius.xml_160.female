Lol, well yeah, I found this song on a Goo Goo Dolls album, and I just wanna shout it out to all my sucidal friends who want me to help out...the song explains itself, take note of it!  GOO GOO DOLLS    Up Yours  Up yours Stop your whine Feelin' swell And I'm doin' fine Yeah fuck your suicide It's all bullshit 'cause I tried And it really don't impress me all that much Up yours What you find Sit right down I got time And you say here comes the end And you haven't got a friend And I'm standing here just screaming at the wall Up yours Stop your whine Whatta ya got I got mine And you shake your stupid head And you wish that you were dead And I swear sometimes you're happier than me And you know it's hard to be All the things you want me to be And you go and make it hard on me But I swear that anything you could be I could be can't you see Up yours Got no mind That's too bad You got time Yeah, fuck your silly game 'Cause it's driving me insane And it really doesn't matter much to me  Thats all, so toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
