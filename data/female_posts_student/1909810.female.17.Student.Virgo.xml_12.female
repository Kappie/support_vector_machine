I hate how our society characterizes success as making a lot of money, I find it sad to live in a world where money seems to be the only thing that matters...gotta get through high school and college so you can make some money, and that's it.  The education doesn't matter, just as long as you have those degrees and titles..then you're worthy enough to make money and be successful. maybe I could just run away to a deserted island and live in peace. I feel useless right now, and dumb in some of my classes. ugh, i'm just in a bad mood...i hate this feeling though, i wish it would just go away...but it always seems to come back sooner or later. And there's nothing really causing it, so I try to come up with things and excuses of why i feel this way, so I can tell myself that its ok to feel like this, that I have a right to be depressed...but I don't.  peace project was enjoyable.  I think I have an anxiety disorder.  I need help.  I'm fucked up.
