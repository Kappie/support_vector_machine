The thing that bummed me the most was that there was no Stag of the night award. Yeah, it's shallow, but I just wanted to show some certain people that going stag on the prom isn't the end of the world. So yeeeah.. I felt a bit biased when there was no award at all. But moving on... I'll try posting some pics some time. :D
