Oh my stinkin' goodness. For those who haven't seen it, It has Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin in it, and they were both about 10. Elijah's mom dies and his dad has to go on a business trip so he has to live with his aunt and uncle for 2 weeks while his dad is away. Well his cousin, Macaulay Culkin, is this weird, sick, demented kid who enjoys killing people....I was watching the movie and I felt so sick, I mean physically sick. I thought I was going to throw up, no joke. Elijah and Macaulay were good in the movie, especially for being 10, but I never want to see that movie again... Who in there right mind would write something like that???
