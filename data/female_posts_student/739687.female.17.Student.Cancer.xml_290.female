Just the fact that at 6 I woke up after a whole four hours of sleep, and I was like tossing and turning and just couldn't fall asleep.  Yes, well...anyways.  Didn't do too much last night. I have kickboxing today and I really should actually GO, unlike Saturday.    My Birthday is Monday, June 23rd....6 days! Hooray!    And then I get to leave for vacation. Two weeks. My parents have this great idea to  drive  all the way to Pennsylvania. Honestly, I'm good with flying. Because a week on the road with my family is like the vacation from hell. I told my mom that and she yelled at me. She insists it's going to be "fun". Well I think her idea of fun is very very very messed up. So if anyone would like to kidnap me on my birthday with no intention of returning me...God, I would appreciate it. I would rather drive up there with some psycho killer anyway.  Haha yes. Well, I think I'm going to go get a shower now.   Kidnap me, crazies.
