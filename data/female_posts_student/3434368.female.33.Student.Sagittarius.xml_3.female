Anyone way--here's what I got started so far.  I guess it is about harps and other things. I play the harp, so it should be interesting poem:  Harp Sestina Poem My brother says I've owned six harps. I only lay claim to five on this earth. I love to hear harp music play... from Ireland bands to deep in the heart of Texas. Just watch me pluck down a rainbow. And fill the world with love.  What is the meaning of the word love? I meditate on this while I pluck my harp(s). Love is like a beautiful rainbow... It fills the sky and makes us wonder here below on this earth. Love could mean friendship like our State of Texas.. motto. OR we may just really love like Romeo and Juliet in that play.  play love Texas harps earth rainbow  Those are the next words that must end this Sestina set. I think I will go to bed soon and will write more on here later. Maybe, y'all can help me out!   Goodnight :)
