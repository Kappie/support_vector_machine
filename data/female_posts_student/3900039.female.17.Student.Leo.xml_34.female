For my birthday I've decided to ask for: scrapbook stuff(for a senior scrapbook), vases and boxes to decoupage(for myself for once), pretty much anything from Michael's craft store, and for Gabe to come down for a few days. Okay wishful thinking on the last one, but I'm allowed to dream. Gabe sent me an email :D :D he misses me, I'm excited. Anyway, my friend Carol is in New York, and the terror alert there is red now... and I'm a little paranoid. Kinda creepy, one friend is across the world and the other across the country and we have a red terror alert, not good. But my friend Collin is now home safe and sound for good. I've spent the past two nights doing nothing at his house, it's always good. Music in the park is tonight and I'm going with the girls. Alex maybe too. I'm not really in the mood to go yet tho... Hopefully later, we will see. The scabs on my feet are all better, I'm really glad. I have some beautiful scars instead tho. Justine got pictures back from the yearbook retreat and Grafitti. They are really cute! I'll post them when I get a chance. I love my friends, we are so cute! HA, Jonathon(collin's brother) told us to use better adjectives...We said cute every two seconds about every picture... it was bad. So we went with adorable and pretty and  goregous and fun and gross and ugly and I think we threw in whorish a few times... I watched Kill Bill with the SCs.... bloodiest movie ever, it was disgusting! And then it just freaking ends with no real ending!!!! grrr.... stupid movies I'm done.
