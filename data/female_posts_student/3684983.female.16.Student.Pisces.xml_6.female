It is about Landon(West), who's skating through high school on looks and bravado till one day an incident happened to him and it begins a new life for him.  It was because he had met a preacher's daughter whose name is Jamie(Moore). She's a person whose self-confidence doesn't depend on the opinions of others. It was kind of a touching and sad story first written by Nicholas Sparks and directed by Adam Shankman. This movie reminds me of a story about an angel. This angel was sent by the god to bring happiness and meanings to some certain people in the Earth. Her job is to learn the true meaning in a person's life. As well as to leaves a memory in everybody's mind when she was surmon back to the god. When she was in Earth, she likes every other normal children who went to kindergarten, primary school and finally secondary school. At the age of 14, she was required to go back to the side of the god. Before she went back, the god put her into a test. The god made her to feel weak days by days and wanted to test what she have learn throughout the time in Earth. She have learned how to loves a person unconditionally, have faith in someone whom other people think that the person will never succeed. She also learned that even when she in the worst situation that a person could ever had, she still full of hopes and dare to dream for what she wants to achieve. Sadly to mentioned that before she can fulfill all her dreams and goals, she was summon back to the god. The god asked her one last question before she grew back her wings and fly to the sky, which is "Do you have any regrets?" She replied:"Regrets? Sure I do, it was a pity that I didn't get to stay by his side in the future but I get to loves a person with whole-heart and this person returns me back the love too." The god said:"No! You do get to stay by his side forever. For you have leaves him a full ocean of precious memories and his heart will always be remembering you." The angel was thankful to the god for sending her this mission to Earth. In the end, the angel went back to the god and pray for those who needs love. The fact is this angel did really leaves a full ocean of memories for those that once walk with her in her life journey.
