I went over to alex's house after that and I gave him his easter present, a movie he's been wanting for a while. He liked it, and that made me happy. Ian and Liz were still there so we hung out and that was fun. I fell asleep around nine and when I woke up tracy had arrived so that was cool. It was... an experience. I wish it could have gone better. Oh, and I'm tired of changing myself, and kissing everybody's ass all the time just to please them, and sometimes getting little or nothing in return. The new philosophy is "If you dont like it, then F U C K Y O U!!!" I think it's a decent way of thinking.  25 hours. That must be a new fucking worlds record for us getting along.
