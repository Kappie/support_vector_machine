The deadline for consultation on the new crossing is the 24th August 2004 and letters have been delivered to residents along the Lea Bridge Road near the proposed site. I've asked for a copy of the map in a form I can post on here so that residents who want to see it can get it from here too but you can also send your comments to me and I'll forward them onto the consultation process. Looking at the map the site is basically half way between Melbourne Road and Whitney Road outside 530/532 Lea Bridge Road westbound and 497 Lea Bridge Road eastbound. As well as being a traffic signal controlled crossing, it will also include zig zag markings and a 50 metre anti-skid surface either side of the actual crossing. The plans also propose changes to the parking bays at the top of Melbourne Road and Whitney Road to allow loading and unloading for the shops whose frontages would be affected by the introduction of the zig zags. I know there has been substantial concern about road traffic accidents at this site so it is important local residents help ensure we get this crossing sited in the right place so please do get in touch if you have any views about the proposals.
