And when I hang out in Toledo, it seems that EVERYONE is engaged, married, having children, or in serious relationships that are well on their way to marriage.  I am not ready.  Is that okay, world?  Is that okay conservative, baby-making, Midwestern society?  I don't want children, I don't want to discuss the mortgage, I don't want to commit to someone just because I think that's the next step in life.  I don't!  Is that okay?  Can I do that?  I mean, I am seeing the most random people getting married.  I mean, these people couldn't get dates in high school as far as I can remember, and now they're getting married?  I mean, they were and are wonderful people, but are they marrying the first thing that comes along?  I am not willing to do that.  I know there's better out there, I know it.  Am I the fool for believing that?  Man.  I hate how Toledo does this to me.
