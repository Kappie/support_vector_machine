And i cant trust writin things in my diary anymore... *cough mum cough* Right so if you dont wanna hear the angry/stressed/crapped up side of me dont read it.  *****Leavin a space so people can tell when to stop readin*********  Right so im guessin all who reads this dont care and dont judge... good.  It all begins with that feelin you get when you've just been somewhere or done something really nice/different/refreshin and everythin suddenly goes back to normal. It's a shock to the system! Well basically i have that feelin again.  i think its time to find a word for it... erm... okay - bleurgh! i suppose u could say meh but thats a bit mild for this kinda thing. Well i get this feelin every time i go home (yeh and that is why i dont like goin home for anyone with which that didnt click) and i have it again. Its just depressin! And also i get back in touch with people through various ways (afta bein in yorkshire) and suddenly they're havin a go and others are point blank ignorin what i say... for no reason! why? what did i do? im just gonna stop talkin to them (if i can - im findin it hard to stop talkin at the mo). Yeh and now its the final for euro 2004, which works me up so im gonna try and ignore it really. Okay... fine ive been interupted in my flow... dads just nicked the computer and mums started nosin in AGAIN! Why cant they just leave me alone? theyve already read my diary... is that not enuf!?! Okay you want more? The world is fucked really. We (as in human race) have really messed it up. I hate science and technology (ironic really - but you know the kind i mean... no? like cloning and that side of things - and science being All they're stupid laws are gonna be proved wrong again at one point... why do we have to memorise a load of stupid 'facts'... i dont even belive in science and i dont care! again ironic as im takin physics next year but ive decided im droppin that asap!) - ya didnt expect that bracket there afta so much racket did ya? Fuck! I really wanna commit suicide! it just seems so sensible at the mo. People are always tellin ya to talk to someone when you're angry or stressed, and it does much ya feel better in a way that youve lifted a heavy weight off your chest but then you feel even more down cos youve just loaded all your worries on them... thats not fair! and on top of that youve suddenly realised whats been keepin ya down... makin ya want to think about suicide more! Hey im now reminded of when i was like nine or ten, and i thought the world would end (or i would just die) before i was eleven. how naive i was. it was all cos i didnt wanna go to senior school cos of all the changes, and that i didnt wanna lose touch with all mates (which happened as i guessed). Changes part is kinda ironic again as ive like moved house like 5 times (6 houses), and ive had more change than even a coffee machine could handle! Why is my life full of irony? Sometimes i can predict outcomes of things, just cos they're the opposite of what i hope... except serious things (then out comes prayers and things seem to get better). I love god. Yeh and then i think of the serious things (e.g. me cousin went into hospital... nearly died, put things into perspective didnt it! but he's fine now, soo glad!), yeh and i think of them and feel so guilty/selfish cos look what theyve had to go through, look at what ive got, and look at what im moanin at! Im gettin depressed ova nufin! Which ends up makin me more depressed, seein as im so pathetic! I suppose one good thing comes outta this... Ive been soo depressed that im hyper when i go out and meet people. Its quite good really cos then no-one thinks im actually depressed so no-one worries and i can relax... and be the myself that i want to be all the time. And this is what im like when im with people for a long long time - e.g. school trip so im forced to be hyper, and so forced not to think bout what depresses me... which is really good for my mind. Its a break you see. And then people come back and say 'yeh you always argue when you're together all the time' and then i find that frusratin cos i just dont... i dont argue cos i know better. i dont cos i know if i do then i'll get even more depressed than i already was. Which leads me onto another thing. Someone who shall remain nameless annoyed me for such a long time, then a passed that stage and now i luv her! but in that time we were in a band (btw it has nufin to do wit plastic spoon type people so dont worry)... and she was great to have in the band, but she thought it was just a petty school thing, and i was in it for real. I wanted to get up and runnin, play in pubs, etc. but al the time she was so negative like, 'we'll never be that good' and all i could think of was 'well maybe you might not but im willing to try'. For fucks sake be optimistic for once! (ignorin ironism here as i was out with people therefore hyper and happy, so not depressed, so it wasnt ironic at that point). And im gonna shut up bout that point now. Well ive ranted quite a lot. there are many other things but some are too personnal to actually go on here. so this is were i stop. if youve actually read this turn a blind eye cos this isnt me when i next see you. i warn you now. 'then why did she post it?' i here you cry... because its made me feel better and less depressed, and now that ive said it i wont keep goin over it. lets forget and say goodbye. I'll leave you with a song which is held close to this depressed heart... Under the Bridge...
