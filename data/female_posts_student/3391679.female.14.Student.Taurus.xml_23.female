I actully wanted to spent that money on school cloths or at hot topic but i didnt want my mom to not be able to go just because of money so i took her. The movie was "cute" {hate that word} and chad michael murray was in it so that was a plus. The movie wasnt whati expected but it was worth buying on video so i might do that. I wasnt as funny as i thought it would be but still real good. I just dont like that you cant just look at her {even in the cheesy mask} adnd not tell it is her. The look at people who rnt even blond to see if it is his "cinderella" i mean come on.     DO you ever feel like you are living a double life? I do. I have my life that isnt all em. THen i have my life online where i dont lie to people. I am just me the way i want ot be. {Ihope} The me i think i am. SOmetimes I try to please my friends , family, and the other people around me way tooo much. I wish i could just be me. My thought is that i cant be me now because i am a kid and my mom has a hold on me. What i can do and whon i can hang out with. I have ceratin friends just to make other people happy or get what i want. Like i have a friend but i start hanging out witnh her more when she becomes friends with the guy i like. Usually hough i end up getting my friend andd the guy together. Then realize i dont like them at all. Which life doI like better? Well this one. The one where i tell myself how it is and i get everything out in the open wiht my self. I like to think someone else is reading it and likeing me for me but they r not. I need to get over it and tell the truth.... i write this stuff for myself. {and the occasional passer by} i write this stuff so i dont kill myself. SO i can get it all out and in the open. Not held up inside until it eats me alive. The way i see it is that when i go into college my two selves will come toghether and i will not only be myself, but i will be happy. My tru self. dont let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game............me myself and i
