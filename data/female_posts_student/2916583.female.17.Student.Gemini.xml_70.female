I won this thing at after-prom, good for a free round of golf, and I thought that I'd give it to my dad for Father's Day, since he loves golf.  That was a big mistake.  Unfortunately, it expired June 1, and when he called the golf place to extend the date, he found out it was free (well, technically it was $5, the cost of my afterprom ticket).  So, I have to get him a new present.  Ok, ok, two presents to make up for not putting much thought into his gift.  It's just that I know exactly what my mom likes and doesn't like, because we go shopping together, talk, actually spend time together.  I don't really know what he wants, and he's terribly picky.  He's Rachel - very rarely does he ever keep a gift; if he doesn't return it, he complains till we get him something else, and uses the return money to pay bills, and complains he didn't get a present cause he had to use the money for bills.  So, I really don't like Father's Day in the first place.  To make things worse, SOMEONE had the brilliant idea to serve a third straight night of seafood on the bar, so I didn't get home until two hours after I was supposed to get off.  My dad yelled at me the entire way home (I was an hour and 55 minutes late, but I had to clean and stock everything), and I started crying.  One funny thing did happen at work, but it's funny enough to send to Reader's Digest and get money.  Since you can't publish the joke anywhere else, I'm not skippin out on the possibility of $200 to tell a funny story.  Plus, one of the best comedies ever, Zoolander came on last night, and that instantly cheered me up.  There's just something about watching an idiotic male model being brainwashed to kill political figures that makes you laugh.    Matilda: I used to be bulimic. Derek: You can read minds?  Of course, there's also the Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good, and Will Ferrell.  It's inching its way up to the list of Best Movies Ever. I think I've figured out why I haven't been sleeping well lately.  I rearranged the furniture in my room, and ever since, I've slept so much better.  Now, I don't believe in that feng shui thing for a second, but I do believe that moving my bed from the middle of the longest wall to the corner of the longest wall and the wall with a window did make a difference.  That, and I haven't drank milk in three days, not counting this morning.  I'm usually very strict about getting all three servings a day, but milk prices have skyrocketed.  Every time I go to get some, I'm afraid I'll drink enough to buy another gallon.  I'll just have to find some vitamins or something with lots of calcium. Well I wanted to check out Shaheen's blog before this new internet service freezes.  I absolutely hate it, and hope that my mom will cancel it ASAP and get AOL back soon (or at least high speed internet).  Later.
