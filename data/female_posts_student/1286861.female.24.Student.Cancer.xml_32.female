I am over at my mom's tonight where the family is congregating for dinner�all but my brother Corey, his wife and child. I being in the position to utilize my mother�s computer jumped on the prospect. So here I am. I don�t have a whole lot to write, but I will attempt to keep it interesting.  I went to dinner Wednesday night with  urlLink Brenden  and some of his friends. To be honest, I was very nervous. We went to dinner at a restaurant they frequent, and then we went to the UCLA dorms and played pool till the wee hours of the morning. I wanted nothing else than to make a good impression. And I think I accomplished that. At least I hope that John, Kris, and Fuji think so. Brenden reminds me that compared to his last girlfriend, I did great. I am good with that.  I read through  urlLink Chris�  blog for the first time in a while today, being strung from the computer and what not. I realized how much I miss chats with him Thinking about you brother!  I am dead tired. Think I will now beg for a ride back to my house where I can go right to sleep.  Oh yeah�I bought a microwave :)
