(c:  iii)  urlLink Patches  cards make anyone smile!  iv) When you've had enough of stupid men and are totally aggrivated the cure is a night out at bar9 with all your  urlLink girls  and some yummy appletinis.  v)  It takes a long time to get mail from Hong Kong, especially when you're waiting for your birthday present to yourself to arrive.  (Btw:  8  days til my birthday, and  3  til Anna's!)
