For AP (advanced placement) History, I have to read a book called A People's History of the United States, 1942-Present. It's very much like Lies My Teacher Told Me, which I read for Honors History last summer, but it seems to just spark in me list upon list of things that I despise about America. I, being of Indian Ancestry, The Mica Mac tribe from upper Maine, Canada-ish to be exact, take offense in the means we use to teach children today about Columbus. I've full intent on becoming a teacher, and if it were up to me I'd tell the little Kidnegarteners the real story.  It'd go like this (Me, looking teacher-ish, holding up a book speaking to a room of kidnegarteners in a circle) "Today we're going to learn about Christopher Columbus!" "Yay!" say the kids. "Can anyone tell me anything about Columbus?" "He's my hero!!!" A little boy cries out.  "No, no Johnny. You can decide that after I read you the book." I begin to read. "Once upon a time there was a man named Christopher Columbus, " "Yay" the kids call out again.  "and he went to the king and queen of spain for three ships. The Nina the Pinta and the Santa Maria. He promised the king and queen he would bring back gold and spices. He thought he was going to Asia." I turn the page to a picture of Indians coming to the shore. "But instead, he stumbled upon Haiti and the Arawak tribe. He noticed they had gold in their ears, so he left 39 men with them to turn the Arawaks into slave laborors and to find the gold." The children look up with confused faces. "Then his men killed them!" Gasps fill the room. "Columbus then goes to a place called Cuba. There he makes a rule that everyone over fourteen must collect a certain amount of gold by the end of the month. When they get that gold, they have to go and get a copper token put around their neck to show they got it." I turn the page to a picture with Natives looking up at the sky, their hands spurting blood." But, if they didn't have one, CHOP! The spainiards cut their hands off and let them bleed to death."  Some of the children look like they are going to cry. "That's not all," I turn the page to a picture of chained Indians. "they took many of the Indians as slaves..." I go to the next page showing an image of and Indian woman drowning her infant. "They ran to try to save their lives too. Because the Spainairds thought that killing the Indians was no big deal. Women killed their babies to save them from Columbus and his crew. And then we got America, by killing and inslaving all the Indians. The End." I turn to a page with "The End" spelt out in bloodied, mangled Indian bodies with a border of chained Indians. The children look up at me scared.   And that's how it would go. Ok maybe you shouldn't tell it to Kidnegarten, but I think Fourth grade would be a good time. I just hate that these kids think that America is some kind of Hero country when we just aren't. I mean look at Hiroshima, that wasn't so long ago. Look at the War on Iraq! We don't have anything justifying our right to be in that country at all. It is not our buisiness. Yes, it is sad, but that is what the UN is for. America is not some kind of world cop, but our minds are so polluted that children think we are good people. And I don't hate America, I dislike a lot of our policies and our morale is about as good as a baby-killing crack whore's, but we have things like Krispy Kreme doughnuts and huge malls to our name. But really, I just wish that we'd get a decent president for once. I liked Bill Clinton, he was a normal guy. I wish he would come back! Well now on to Kayle buisiness... I met this guy in yahoo grafiti. We talked for all of ten minutes. I know NOTHING about him. He wants me to come visit him in Vermont. Hmmm lets all take a minute and think of some posibilities of who this guy is. (1) Child Molester. (2) Very desperate ugly person. Or on an off chance (3) Guy who for some reason had an immediate attraction to me, is normal, and just wants to get to know me.  HA HA HA I don't like meeting people online, you can never know whether to trust the situation or not. It's frusterating. Well I'm off to do things like homework, because I have no life.  Visit me at Dairy Queen 5-9 unless you are an ex bf just coming to bug me... (James) Who will yell through my window go faster Kayle, faster faster faster. That sounded dirty. Oh well.   I love you, you love me, we're a happy family, with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you, wont you say you love me to.  Goodbye song from Barney.   Kayle
