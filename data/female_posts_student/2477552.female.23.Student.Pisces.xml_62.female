Pro- I was told by my male co-worker that he's open to dating older women. Pro- I told him "okay, you missed a spot over there by that other flower". Pro- I wore a ultra-cool electric orange kid's mcdonald's tshirt today. Pro- I got my second two-week paycheck.   Con- I had to sweep dried dirt/cow manure off the sidewalks with a broom.      (Cow Manure, though dried, sticks.)  Con- Both decently cute male co-workers are only 19.      (One of them turns 20 this weekend. Um, ahem, whuhoo.)		 Double Con- This silent but sweet 19 year-old has a fiance.  Neutral- I have developed somewhat amazing bicep muscles, quite possibly the largest of my life.  Neutral Con- I gained some tricep muscle today doing the crazy hectic sidewalk sweep for over a half an hour.  Funny Con- My day-glo ultra-bright orange shirt made numerous men look at my boobs. Um, somehow this is being downgraded to a Neutral, if not Neutral Con.  Pondering...
