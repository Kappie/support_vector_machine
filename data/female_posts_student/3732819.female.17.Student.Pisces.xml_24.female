He told me about a problem he had last night which was Sunday....but i had to leave during the convo because i had to head back inside my house...and i thought he was mad at me for i guess cutting him off...and i didn't hear from him at all today which is quite weird for me cause i talk to him just about every single day...but like 20 minutes ago he logged on, and he's like good your here...and he told me about the whole update of his problem, and he actually purposely came online to tell me....and then he went offline after he told me (of course he said bye and stuff) but yeah...he came online just to "update" me...which i found SUPER sweet...cause it showed that he was thinking about me....i dunno...i'm weird i guess....but still...he seems like such an ass...but he's just like me and into the whole anti-cheating deal thing...like we're both VERY against it...which i absoloutly love..but actually he takes the cheating line VERY seriously...like he finds it cheating if his gf went to the movies with another guy...he would find that cheating...but we went into a whole discussion about it and it really quite depends on the situation which is totally true....but yeah....he says a lot of sweet stuff and actually seroiusly saying it....like the one thing i REALLY like about him is that he knows when to joke and when to be serious....which means a lot to me....but one thing that i'm thinking about now...i've never been upset when i'm with him on the phone...ever time i see him name on my call display it actually just puts a smile on my face...like i love to hear from him...and i feel so bad too cause its long distance for him to call me....but i keep telling him that he doesn't need to call me and that i can talk to him over the net or something like that and he's like no no no its fine your not a waste of money at all...i love talkiing to you....ARGH! boys! anyways yes...i hear the garage door opening which means my brother is home...i shall write more of my ranting stuff later.... Ta Ta Y'all...HEY MA WHATS FOR DINNA?!
