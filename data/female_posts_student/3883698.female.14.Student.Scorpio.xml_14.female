It may seem like the world is against you, And the reasons for living become unclear,  But remember there are people who love you, And would miss you if you were not there.    When peace and love seem to fade, And death appears to be the only way out, This is when grief you need to evade, No matter how big the doubt.  Look around and you will see, There are people far worse off than you, Compared to their feelings you are so happy Even during times bluest of blue.   So the moral is simple and sadly true, There’s always someone with a worse life than you, So get to grips and face reality, Things will get better, wait and see.
