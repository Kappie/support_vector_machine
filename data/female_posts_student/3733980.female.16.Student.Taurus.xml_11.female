DON'T GET ANY WEIRD IDEAS, ELIZABETH! ;P Not to single anyone out, but... ^^ Anyway, sleep... I went to bed around tenish last night and woke up around eight. Isn't that  CRAZINESS ? I thought so. Thank goodness! ^_^ No, really.  urlLink Thank goodness, dangit!   Um... let's see... Mom left this morning for grad school, leaving the cutest little note:   Lina  Mike: Good morning! Mommy loves you! I'll be gone all day at the Rockwall PDC  grad school. (sad face) However, you may call Precious if you need anything.  P.S. I'll miss you!   That an... um... I didn't actually end up reading any of the Agony yesterday... and July's coming up, so I'm going to read a WHOLE BUNCH today! Yes, yes I shall! And I know what you're thinking, 'Gosh, Caroline! Procrastination! Tsk tsk!' but that's not the case at all. My main goal is to enjoy myself this summer. Last summer, I didn't. I went to summer school and I finished my summer assignment early, but it was the most un-summer-like-summer of my entire life. Didn't even get to go to  urlLink church camp.  That is a  big deal  for me. So to make a long story short, I started the school year last year burned out and sucked dry. And it was the worst "year" of my life. Almost  died . Okay? So I don't care what you say, I'm never taking summer school and I'm not going to work myself hard this summer at all. Judge all you want, but, baby,  urlLink prepare to be judged.   Let's see. Now that I've scared off, like, half of my audience. ^^;;; Oh well. Um... I was just thinking about my purity ring. I'm thinking of wearing it on my left hand to further remind me of whom I am saving myself fully for. I think I even want to save my  first kiss  for my husband. I mean, not, like, the first kiss be that part in the ceremony "You may now kiss the bride," more like, as a fellow  urlLink barlow girl  said, "When there's a diamond, he gets the smooch :)" =^_^= I want to save as much of myself for my future husband as possible. :D So I don't plan on getting involved in any serious relationship for a  long  time. God's timing is perfect, and, hey, I've got to get to know 'im before I know if he's the one (or  urlLink a prince or a frog  for that matter). ^_^v  Ah... I like that song by Skillet, "You take my rights away..." *listens to it* Ooh!  Invincible ! [^_^] Ya know you just can't kill a man when he's dead. Yup yup.  Ooh! Yesterday, I got to "meet" some of Laura (mai sistah in Christ who lives in Maine?) 's friends from church. Ryan, Katheryn, Jesse... uh... don't remember much else. They were pretty cool. Wow. A youth group where everyone actually -knows- eachother. What a cool thing.  Anyway,  enough with my  unusually  negative babble, I gots to go get a shower or something. ^^
