We don't hear much at all about hurricanes back home in Australia, so it's with interest that I follow  urlLink Hurricane Charley .       I've stumbled across some awesome blogs from people either living in the hurricane's path or that are posting constant news and photos/video. Check' em out:   urlLink Hurricane Charley WeatherBug  (I especially like  urlLink Traveling with Charley )  urlLink Candie Goodyear   urlLink Goodyear Family  (features video)  urlLink My Single Mom Life   urlLink Side Salad   urlLink Shutter Blog   urlLink Bark Bark Woof Woof   urlLink Orlando Sentinel  (no longer updated but has some unbelievable pictures)       There's a good summary article urlLink here .
