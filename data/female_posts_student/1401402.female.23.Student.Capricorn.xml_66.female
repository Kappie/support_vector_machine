I don’t know why am I so excited but I am really happy. I can just sit here and smile forever. Love my life, I love my life. Maybe because it is payday and I am so ready for the weekend hehehhehe.   I have been listening to these Chinese songs. I have no idea what this person is singing about or the theme of these songs. However, I love the beat and it somehow so what really relaxes me. They put me in such a romantic mood that I prefer a lover in my life to dance with. Does anyone want to be my lover? Lol, I didn’t think so.   I got bored being the boring old Sakdary. So, I made myself this flirt profile with a pix. Very harmless rite.  One guy compliment me about my skin color. He said that I look like a chicken that is choking on water. HELLO, I am 50% Cambodian (khmer), 25% Vietnamese, and 25% Chinese. I know that I am very light for a khmer girl but believed me, I am khmer!!!. In addition, I am so darn glad that I am light-skinned color.  I try to tan but never gotten any darker.    After chatting with so many people online, there is no one and I mean no one that I am interested in chatting with any longer. I had too many people to chat with but I think I will past. I am going to stay away from these so so called strangers. It isn’t worth my time chatting if I would keep making these frowns faces. You know, left eyebrow up, lip’s all crochet.   There must be something wrong with me. It feels like I have block the entirely wall surrounding myself inside this bubble and never want to come out and play. I don’t like to met people at the club because I think that they are after one thing “SEX”. Guy’s at the mall, players or broke as a joke. I don’t know. I cant explain anything to myself either. They say when it is the rite time, the rite moment, the rite person, I will eventually feel it. But when? When I become too old with wrinkles all over?  What is wrong with me? Why am I doing this? For what? For whom?
