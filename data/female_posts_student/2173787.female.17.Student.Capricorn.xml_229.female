Every year there seems to be a realignment and I never noticed.  It normally happens in December, but its coming early, I can feel it.  This feeling scares me and makes me sick to my stomach.  I had an awesome night, but it was shattered suddenly, in a series of infinitesimal moments, each individual, each representing a different facet of change.  I'm at the point where I no longer care about the group, but I'm also at the point where I feel the least connected to those I've come to rely on over the past few years.  I need to sit down and talk, really talk, to each of them individual, to reconnect in a sense.  So many things have happened in the past few weeks, not all of them bad, the majority of them positive in some way, but added up they build what appears to be a nearly insurmountable wall of change.  I guess its just something I have to accept, but I don't want to.  In the end change is what you make it, so I have to strive to make my life work out the way I want it.  Damn it, change is hard to accept.
