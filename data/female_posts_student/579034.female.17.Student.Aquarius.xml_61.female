Me, Fea, and Rob went to see "Elf" it was really cute, got me in the Christmas spirit. It was funny at the end everyone is singing that "You better not pout, you better not cry..." song and Rob started singing along. It was a really cute movie. Then we went to Wendy's... it was lovely... OH but in drivers ed today, I was driving back to school and "Get Low" came on so we listened to it, and then 50 Cent came on sayin "Yo, yo, ya'll this is 50 Cent" or something like that and Mr. C goes "Fitty sent, yea yea." and I dunno why but it just struck me as SO funny I was like hysterical laughin while I was drivin. And like he kept sayin funny stuff and John and Fea were being stupid in the back seat and I dunno I only laughed that hard once all week so it was a good Friday. I missed Debra though, she wasn't there today. So yea... I'm gonna go and watch Premium Blend.. a lotta comdey never hurt anyone. Much love x0x0x0x
