I have also a triquatra...for those who don't know what im talking about...think of the Charmed 'trademark' i have 2picureds of those..the looks so awesome. I have one thing that says 'wiccan..latin translation, the wise one' oh ya! lol...I kinda took it upon myself to do a reading while talking to emily. I guess she was alil freaked out. I guess all that practice with my cards paid off lol.   I hope no one minds but im trying to find a good picture of the wiccan Rede...or the wiccan law lol.  i know what it is im just trying to find something on it.  'Bide the wiccan law ye must in perfect love and perfect trust, Eight words of the wiccan rede fulfill An ye harm none, do what ye will And ever mind the rule of three What ye sends forth comes back to thee Follow this with your mind and heart merry we meet merry we part'   found it!
