A  friend  is someone you can talk to, hang out with or at least stand being around them for more then 10 minutes at a time, but  friendship , for me, is a little different. Friendship is a 2 way street, and can only work if there is trust, and a friend-like love, a base/backround if you will.    A friendship is not easily broken, and if its strong enough you will always get back together, nothing can stand in the way of a true friendship.    But of course if its not meant to be, it will eventually break up, but don't get yourself to worked up about it, because you can always do better, because there is always a friendship waiting to be started, you just have to open your mind, and your heart and give it a shot...No fear, right??    Personally, I have had a few confrontations of this sort... some have ended badly, and some haven't ended at all, but what i do know, is that the ones that did end aren't meant to be... and i've accepted that, im not going to beat myself up about it, there's no point.    You can't base a friendship soley on decisions that are made, or you might as well be asking to end your friendship with this person.  We know not all decisions are the smatrest in the world, but hey give them a break, after all wer're only human...and sometime we don't give our decisions much thought.     Some decisions are based on anger, done soley to make another person feel bad, or unimportant, and sometimes we say things we don't mean...but for thoes things you have to dig deeper, and find the meaning of the words, don't just lash ut at someone becaus ethey call u a slut (for example) find out why they called you it, maybe they're just jealous.    The reason people hurt other people is because they hurt or want to feel good abou themselves, and by hurting other people, they don't hurt alone.... Like i've heard many times before -->  Misery loves company
