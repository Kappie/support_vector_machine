UGH I want to go now! My shitty Direct tv thing kept going fuzzy from the snow storm so I missed alot of it I was getting so pissed. But I'll just stay up til 11 to see it again, hopefully It'll be better! I really hope tomorrow is a good show! I'm gonna feel so stupid If I get one of their autographs I have no idea what's gonna happen
