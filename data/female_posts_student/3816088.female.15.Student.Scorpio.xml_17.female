I have always been really really pale and I really dont care because i have now gotten used to my skin color but sometimes the jokes inside the family can get to you. So i have decided that im going to  try  to get tan or at least some color. So today I went and laid out with tanning lotion on for about an hour and guess what color i am now.....pink! I always get red. im not sun burnt just red. ohh well whatever ill try again tomorrow and see if i have any change at all and maybe after Hawaii i will have some more because i will be in the sun a lot. Lets all just say a little prayer...(in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, amen) Dear Lord, Please add  some  color to heather garretts skin because she is just pathetically pale, AMEN! ok well lets see if this works.
