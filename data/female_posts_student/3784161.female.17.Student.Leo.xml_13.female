When did you last know someone that died with absolutely no regrets?  If these occurances are so rare, then why is it okay to look at a school with 1800+ teenagers and not only accept but anticipate the likely failure of 70% of them?  I thought this was America, the land of the free. I thought that all men were created equal, and that everyone was supposed to be given a shot at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I guess I missed the memo that teens are exluded from these opportunities, espescially those from poor families. Since when is 15 old enough to label someone hopeless? When did it become okay to stop all efforts towards a decent furture for kids that made a few mistakes, or worse, because their parents did?  I think I know the answer- since certain adults found their way into power and money, they have the responsibility but not the time or concern for these "hopeless" teenagers.   I'm disgusted. My local school board and county commission are too busy feuding with each other to do their jobs. The final vote on budget cuts will come on tuesday, and the vote on the supposedly neccessary tax comes on wednesday. I'll be gone for both. I doubt that even with these massive cuts I'll be dramatically effected in my last year of school, but others will, and in the years to come it can only get worse. Just the thought, of grown men and women - educated and trusted by the community, being so immature and at such an enormous cost, it's mind numbing.
