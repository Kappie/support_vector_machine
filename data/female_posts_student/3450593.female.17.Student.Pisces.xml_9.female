So get over it. All that's done now, I've moved on completely. I haven't been here cos I thought it would remind me of all that shit... which is just embarassing really. But I really am a stronger person than that, cliched as it is. All that happens when I think of Katherine now is that I feel a little sick at what she gets away with time and time again. Since then, I've been to America and had the time of my life with Phil. Then I went to Wales for the weekend, on a white water rafting experience thing. That was one of the best things I've ever had the fortune to take part in. Scary, exhilerating, euphoric.... and all those kind of things. Also, I really fancied the instructor! ;) Yeah, so that has completely rekindled my enthusiasm for stupid sports... I'm looking into windsurfing lessons at Salford (after doing it by trial and error, I think it's time I developed some skill) and I've decided that I definitely want to take a gap year. Either becoming a ski instructor with the assistance of a career development loan or getting some watersports qualifications. I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in an office. I'm going to do something I enjoy and I'm more determined and motivated than ever now. All these people who are fucking me off can have their comfortable, well paid jobs in the suburbs. I'm gonna have some fun. I've also come to the odd realisation that I'm actually fine without a partner at the moment. No seriously, I'm ok! I still fancy Sarah, and she remains a good friend, but thinking about it, I wouldn't want to get into a relationship with even her at the moment. Cool. So overall, I'm happy. Or I will be when I get my tax money sorted out! But that's a minor quibble. Life is good, and I'm gonna live it.
