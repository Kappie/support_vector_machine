Photoscala has the newest  urlLink OptioMX press release , but no word on the weight of the thing, and it looks a lot bigger than I expected. An earlier press release said the Dualcam would be about 3" by 3" but it's hard to tell from the photo. It looks more like a traditional tape camera than the ultra compacts like the  urlLink D-Snap  or the truly teeny  urlLink Philips Key ring camcorder .  Of course, the video quality from a digital camera isn't going to be as good as what you get with a dv camera, but I'm looking for something really small that will do both photos and video reasonably well. Another option is the  urlLink Fisher FVD-C1 , which I wrote about for  urlLink ShinyShiny . The Fisher retails for $800 and the OptioMX will cost just half that. 10x optical zoom on the OptioMX, 5.8x on the Fisher.  I need a good travel camera so I'm going to take a closer look at the Fisher and will do the same with the OptioMX when it arrives sometime in June. And every time I see that Philips "wearable" camcorder, it seems to beckon me, damn it.
