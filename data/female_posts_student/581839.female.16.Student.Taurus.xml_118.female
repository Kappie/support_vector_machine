And i am in a stump. dad wanted to go camping this friday, at the state park, with me, zack, jordan and him. well, my friend called, and told me that antoinette said she could FINALLY sleep over at her house, and my other friend, caroline, and me. well. when i told dad, he got all sad and pouty and in this sighed voice said, "well, life is full of tough desicions. you've got to choose." Well? what am i supposed to do? he said if there was a cold front, that we might not go. so i have no idea what i'll do. well, school is over, so i've got to go home.  Julia Jones
