Right now,the finals are on.The Lakers and the Pistons.I ain't watching it,I don't like basketball that much,but my dad is.And the thing I would like to know is if anybody shares my dad's opinion of the lakers.His opinion of them is this:  1.Big 5oo(his nickname for Shaq,Diesel Truck and 400 Pounder are some others)should take his big behind back to Orlando  2.Carl Malone and Gary Payton have no business being in LA. Period.Why did they go to a team that is already good.Why not go to a team that needs some help?I told him that they want rings."Yeah,but Jordan didn't so that".He says."Jordan carried the whole team on his back to victory.His team was sorry,but he stuck it out with them.And when he cam back from retirement the second time,he didm't go to the Lakers,he sure could have,but he went to the Wizards."  3.To see a team that loaded messes the game up.As far as he's concerned,the Lakers should be shut down after this season.He can't stand to see them win.Now,i don't know if he relly meant that,but he was mad that the Timberwovles didn't stop them from going to the finals.  4.He says that Fisher is a good actor,because nobody pushed him hard enough to fall on the floor like that.  5.He says that he wants to see tears in Fisher's eyes this year,like he did last year when they lost to the Spurs.  I think it's hilarious.My dad is crazy.I tell him that it's not that serious,but he still persists in yelling at the T.V.
