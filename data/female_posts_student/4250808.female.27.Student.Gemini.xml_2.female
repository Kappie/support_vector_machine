I layed down next to him (it is now after 10) i am ready to go to bed myself except i am to wound up. The second time we put him to bed was a little after 8 and he didnt want to be in there and he let us know by throwing up in 4 different spots. So we had to clean that and give him a bath. After that we tried snuggling reading anything we could think of.   Well when he finally went to sleep in our bed i got up and went to his room and moved some things around and cleaned(in hopes that something was just bothering him there and i could fix it)When i was done an hour later i came and got him and put him in his bed. Climbed in my bed and got all snuggly next to my girl.3 hours later i here comes Noah he came right around to my side and got in went to sleep..... Like a sucker fish he was stuck to me anytime i moved he moved closer.Well about 2 hours later Tish was getting up for work and she took him back to bed. There i was in my cozy bed alone,and sleeping like a brick. So needless to say we didnt get any adult time last night or this morning either:-( We both really enjoy our time together first thing in the A.M and last thing in the P.m )Good news is Tish is going to be home from work in less than 2 hours and we are going to sleep and talk in each others arms. And we do have a lot to talk about. I sent her and email last night and thats always nerve racking for me. I never know how she is going to react. She really makes me feel bad for having feelings and even more so for letting her know about those feelings. But there comes a time when they have to be let out.I dont want all this awful stuff building up and then something insignificant is blown out of preportion.   Other than the sleep problems that Noah is having he is still the light in my eyes. Seems everyday he is bigger and smarter and does something to amaze me. I sometimes feel like i can just look at him for hours and hours. He also is getting more and more use to me. He calls me Mimi but latley and more and more he calls me mommy or mimommy or something. It really is cute. Or he will come up to me and say momma more or whatever and i am like hey your momma is over there --->But he is talking to me. Tish said that it is fine that he can call me whatever he wants.I think that the only one who is going to have a problem with it is Ex. Since she wants to be the one and only mommy. I think she would like it if even Tish wasnt momma. But whatever the simple fact is i love him like he is my own son. I raise him like he is mine and so it is no wonder that he is going to think of me as a mommy. What a lucky little guy to have 3 moms.. I guess we are all lucky that he isnt a girl...... a teenage girl with 3 moms. I couldnt stand my 1 mom when i was a teenager. I want to have a baby and i want it to be a girl.... hmmm    her name is already picked out...Olivia Marie Reed Perez. Never in my life did i think i would want a plain name like that...I have always thought my kids would be name Venus,Skye,Scarlette,Maddison or something... But the more i thought about Olivia Marie the more i really liked it.Not to mention that Olivia is Tish's middle name and Marie is mine.   Anyway enough blabbing. I have to get a few things before the hunny gets home....   ciao ciao
