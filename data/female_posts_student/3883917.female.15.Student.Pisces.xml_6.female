Very few of you (I have to say only members of the female sex) know that I take everything to an extreme. Even if it's already extreme, I feel the need to take it more extreme. (And I'm asking for specific prayers for that.) I still do and always have loved Nick through everything we went through...and every situation was magnified if you heard it from me. *Hides behind a rock*...I don't know how he puts up with me every hour of every day. This week there were a lot of ups and downs for me when it came to our relationship. I kept most of it hidden, I told some to Aaron (but I'll get to that in a minute.) Monday Nick and I went to see the Village...I was expecting it to be all scary, a movie where I'd have to hold on to him and  bury my head in his shoulder to muffle the screams , but well that didn't happen. It actually really sucked. But I still had a really good time; we checked out the little stores in the town and went out for pizza before the movie. And we bought some Big Red at Right Aid *big smile* ...Monday was a good day. Kelly decided at her first football practice that she wanted to quit. *shrugs* not my problem. Anyway, Tuesday my mom and I went shopping...and then I found out (for the second time actually...he told me a week before that but I forgot about it) That he was having this two night sleepover with his band and then going to the fair with them on Friday (because they were playing there). I was kinda upset and stuff because I wouldn't talk to him much or be able to see him at all, but I lived with it. He had a pretty good time there and realized how many friends he really  did  have. Tay and I arrived at the fair at noon for him (but by the time we found him it was like 12:30) I was so happy to see him...we hung out a lot of the day, he played "Slide" for me,  he won me a huge plush turtle  from one of the stupid carni-games...we just had a really good time. And while his band was playing, I was like smiling ear to ear...and then Aaron yells in my ear (because yeah it was that loud and it sounded like a whisper) "And YOU were dissappointed when you found out he was in a band." (That was the thing I talked about with him)...I was so proud of him, he did so good...his voice got a little scratchy and stuff, but other than that he did awesome. He left early so we only hit a few rides...one of them we did together was the zipper, and at one point when it went upside down we kissed and it was pretty cool...he had to go home early but we still had a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, we have to go to church and work but we still get to hang out for a few hours. I feel like we really need it. I think we're at the point in our relatioinship where we're growing so much together, but we're doing so much we don't have time to talk about it. So some down-time tomorrow (which we haven't had since like May or June) will be good for the both of us, but we'll see how it works out. Evertime I look at him, or even it's so powerful where I just have to think about him and it feels like I need to have his arms around me. Like I need to be protected by him from anything I'm afraid of. To feel his strong arms around me, keeping me from anything that could hurt me.  It's an awesome feeling , except for the part that the only time I think about it is when he's not there. Okay, enough of the mushy talk. I got a turtle on Wednesday and I lost it somewhere in my house. Actually, I think my dog ate it but no one in my family agrees with me. Oh well, I'm still praying that I find him alive but I don't think that's gonna happen. He just like disappeared while I was taking a nap. Well anyway, It's almost nine...I just got back from Lori's house and I think I'm gonna call Nick. PEACE!
