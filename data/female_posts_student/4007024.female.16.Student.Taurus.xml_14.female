( maybe that's why i've been so cranky today... ?)  so then i went to cheer prac.. woohoo there was only 8 varsity cheerleaders there so yeah we just shit around and did absolutely nothing. and morgan went on and on about how scared she was to get her wisdom teeth out... i'm just excited i'm going to be knocked out and doing nothing but sleeping for like 5 days. :-D YAY. and she is just beyond herself with excitement that we are getting them out the same day by the same person. yeah but that's morgan for you.. she's the happiest person i know.. and i really don't know how she does it? whatever she is on.. i think i need some. then i bring jill home all the way to BFE.. but hey i had nothing else better to do.. i needed a drive to take my mind off things.  get home.. mom's being somewhat nicer than she was earlier today and she was being EVIL earlier today. my god. she was about ready to boot my ass out of the house. but maybe it was b/c i was being a pain in the ass b/c i was so cranky. so she got me chinese food ( YAY ) which is freaking awesome.  then i watched summerland- yay. good show. but i want to O.C. to start coming back on and one tree hill. gosh i miss those shows.  at about 9:30 i went and met up with the guys and just hung around watching larry the cable guy dvd.. which was fun. and saw the ugliest dog i've ever seen in my life. dude i'm talking about this dog was HIDEOUS.. you think i'm joking. but you will see one day when you take a look at that thing. and they call her lady.. more like nasty. gosh i don't see how anyone would want to buy a dog that disgusting looking.. much less let it inside their house. blah. people these days. but i guess it's what's on the inside that counts. but that's dogs inside aren't so pretty either.. it's annoying as all hell.  i watched startsky and hutch when i got home.. and that is a funny movie everyone. you should watch it. it's worth renting.  still cranky--bed time. laterrrr
