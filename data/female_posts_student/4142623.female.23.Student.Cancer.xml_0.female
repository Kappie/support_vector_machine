It is raining like God just opened up the heavens and let loose. It is move-in day, too; so that's gotta be bad. I am one of the privileged few girls (or maybe the only) who has a private room in this dorm. You should see the "double" rooms. They are the same size as mine with TWO girls staying in them.... Case and I just went to lunch a couple of hours ago, and practically the whole football team was in there. Saga was almost full, and I was the only girl in there. I am not going to deny that I liked that. We came back from Saga and decided to people-watch down in the lobby because there are so many people moving in today. (Hoooooooray for back-to-school functions and free stuff!!!!!!) Anyway, we met a few new people and saw several we already knew. I was especially excited to see Cherrie, my neighbor from Hamil. Cherrie said she and Shasity are living on the second floor together. Case and I also met this really cool guy named Justin who lives in 100. I think we will be friends. Now, sitting in my room seems very anti-climactic. I remember now why I procrastinate. People are just so much FUN!!!!!
