Nokia 3200.. the one which Shu Ai called as "6 eggs" handphone. Alright whatever.. I don't go for looks.. I go for functions..Juz pray that this handphone don't get lost huh.. like the previous one.. that was a very bad experience? Ok... I shall talk about what happened today.. Could not sleep in the night before... due to some reasons I guess..Maybe coldness? Slept only for around 3 hours plus  overslept.. woke up at 7.30am when i was supposed to wake up at 6am? Reached church late for 8am service... arrived at 8.30am instead.. It was so damn funny today ok! When I reached the mrt station it was like "NEXT TRAIN 9 MINS" ... It always happens... and I juz loathe it.. Both services the sermons were the same.. talking about FAVOR... whereby it stands for Faithfulness, Anointing, Vineyard, Offspring  Restorance...Took Amy's car down to orchard where she parked her car at Taka. Went with the youth today to orchard... had lunch at wisma.. where I ate some hakka yong tau foo noodle...  ordered another plate of yong tau foo again.. lol.. people who know me well would jolly well know that I've gotta big appetite... Walked around orchard after lunch...next stop was Topshop..where Amos got so obsessed with his ps2 game that he almost didn't wanna leave...So we walked down to mac first  bought vanilla ice cream cones...After mac..we walked down to CK Tang where we bought a few stuffs... then on the way we stopped at the Giordano in Lucky Plaza for awhile to look around..after that we went to Paragon where I went to see the handphones.. argh.. feel so bad.. made the rest wait for me.. the next stop.. Amy wanted to get something from Louis Vuitton.Arriving at Taka, disappointingly, the shop only allows a certain amount of people to be in the shop.. weird I didn't know until today.. what a "suagu" I am! So she decided not to go in.. as there was a very long queue... on the way I talked to Amy  realised that she stays just opposite me.. What a surprise.. Haha.. ok.. then she drove all of us home...On the way home Amos told me that PLANET SHAKERS IS COMING TO SINGAPORE... During the march holz!! Ain't it cool? Anyway, Amy did not believe at first that I stayed there too.. haha...Ok I came home.. and slept awhile.. counted my money, and went handphone hunting.. The handphone shops at heartland mall were closed so I tooka train down to hougang mall where I got my Nokia 3200 from a handphone dealer.. it's so much cheaper than the ones I saw at paragon.. Glad I did not buy from paragon.. Thank God... :)
