Well so anyway, that has been my problem today.  I can't even begin to tell you guys how worried I am.  I hope they don't make me do another MRI because that thing SUCKS!  Seriously, I hope this gets resolved before school starts because I can't afford another set back.  Oh and then there's my books.  I looked them up and it is going to cost me between $460 and $600 for my books.  There's a range because I don't know how many used books they will have.  UGH  Shoot me already.    Maybe all this is happening because I have been really stressed with Ed leaving and haven't been sleeping well.  I use whatever time I have to do heart walk stuff because it takes me away from thinking about Ed leaving soon and well it does good for my son.  Bailey is so excited and I am excited that he is so determined and helping me a lot more this year.  It is amazing.  Maybe I should get back into scrapbooking, but then again, I don't have a lot of money to do that, but I do have quite a few things to use.  I don't know.  I have to do something though.  So yeah I warn you, you guys may not want to read for the next year or so because you might be reading my thoughts of Ed, redundant as they may be.  I think it is going to be the only way I will be able to cope with his 7-9 month absence.
