I know I need to say 'em But I just can't let them out Your going down the wrong path Your happiness will be cut in half Just trust the Lord Don't put your trust in these shallow things there gonna pass  then you'll be no good I wish I would help you I really wish I could I just can't seem to say it Don't wanna break ya.  Just wanna wake ya up You don't have to be living like this Grabbing satisfaction where ever ya can find it This aint the way I don't wanna see ya living like this.  If only I could find the words...
