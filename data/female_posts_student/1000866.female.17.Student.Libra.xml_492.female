And I don't mean this in a good way.So, Friday was a pretty good day and I was looking forward to my weekend...my WHOLE free weekemd, but noooo. During eighth hour my stomach started to hurt quite a bit and I got home and it started like...killing me, and I just lied down on my bed and sat and waited for my mom to get home. I couldn't even pick up the phone to call her. too much movement involved. So my mom and dad call me and I tell them what's going on, and it was then I realized it was another kidney stone. ARGHHHH. I actually had two last time, but only one dissolved, so....now I have to get the other one to. I went to the Emergency room yesterday because my doctor said I could get the X-ray and CAT scan results faster that way but I was at the actual hospital for like...6 hours. It was SO crowded. So, now I'm up just waiting for the new painkiller to kick in and make me extremely tired. I'm kind of scared though because if it doesn't dissolve by itself, I'll have to go back to the hospital and have an IV and such. Yikes...  And really, other than the trip to the hospital, and me sleeping, I haven't done anything. I haven't eaten in 48 hours though so...I think I might go try to eat something now.
