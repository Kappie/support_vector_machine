Basically it goes really slow and makes the ice look shiny again, and it's actually quite loud when you're right next to it. Gratz on Rob privileges man. Speaking of, if I can get some Abby privileges then all will be set with the world, man. Today/tomorrow is 8 months! It depends on how you consider February to be, and I figure March 1 is more like it. I dunno, I'll probably get yelled at for not calling tonite...grr, Blonder...eh. Man, I really need to shut up.   Peace, all.
