And I'm purposely talking about movies y'all might not have seen ('cos i'm old enough to be everybody's DAD here), that way we all broaden our horizons a little.  I never saw Strange Days or Nell or Dogma or Armageddon either... And talk about feeling out of place - 25 years older than all y'all, and don't know word one of Tagalog...  but I stick around 'cos you're all nice to me.  ;-)
