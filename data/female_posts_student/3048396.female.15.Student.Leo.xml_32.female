I kinda just hate my life right now but *shrug* everythings alright...just more fighting n stuff the normal...So yeah....Yesterday I went to school for a half day and I barely made it thru that much. The drugs I've been takin I think is Benadryl make me really tired and I kept fallin asleep during boring Science. Yeah. Ashley and I were gonna order cheese balls from the drive in yesterday and have those for lunch but her brother was asleep and we couldnt find anyone to go get them for us. So yeah...then I felt really crappy and I came home. My mom was kinda pissed cuz she like never lets me stay/come home unless im like barfin every 2 mins or i have a 102 temp. *shrug*  Anyways I slept for about 2 hours and then just layed around watchin TV. I finally saw the video to my favorite song. I've been waiting forever to. But it doesnt fit the song at all *shrug* oh well...I heart that song. Tho since I was in a crappy mood yesterday it made me cry and it hasnt made me cry in a long time but w/e. Anyways bout 7 I fell asleep again and woke up bout 9 and wandered up to bed...and then didnt wake up till 10 this morning. My dad thinks im sick because I haven't had alot of sleep lately and I don't get any exercise so my body takes it hard. *shrug* Im just mad that im sick on a nice hot day. I wish I could go outside n tan but eh I can't. I just want school to be out and summer to be here. Summer is always the best. Hopefully this summer will be a good one...Cuz im always happy in the summer...well atleast I like to be...I dont wanna cry this summer...So hopefully everything goes right...but I guess you never know do ya...*sigh* well Im still feeling kinda sick...so I shall go back to the couch for now......  -Tara
