She spasms and jolts, and her lips purse and protrude oddly, and she curls her lips in unfortunate ways. I can't watch her with out wincing. I think the only time I find her acceptable is on  urlLink Newlyweds . Then she seems whiny and ditzy, but at least she seems like someone real. I swear she's trying way too hard when she sings, and it's absolutely painful to watch. It's especially noticeable when she sings with a normal singer like Kenny Rogers or Jewel. Less so when she sings with Nick, who seems to come from a similar school of smiling, singing and spasming while moving your hands about in a supposedly emotional way. Ick. It really creeps me out.
