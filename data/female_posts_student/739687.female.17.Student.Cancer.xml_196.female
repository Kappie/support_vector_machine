I'm just optimistic...it's a nice change of pace.  I've realized that...well...I wish I was just happy all the time. And I try so hard, but I never seem to be able to do anything about it. If I'm in a good mood, then it's pure luck. I don't like that about me...I wish I could just have more control. I'm slipping back in to old "habits" lately, and it's kinda scary. I'm just scared to death that I'll end up really screwing myself over. And sure, there are alot of things I do that could screw me over, but what I'm talking about probably isn't what anyone reading this is thinking. If you're reading this, you probably don't even know. And that's probably for the best. I feel like I'm sort of talking to myself, and basically, I am, right? Haha. Oh well.  But all that's okay, because NOTHING is going to ruin my good mood today.   Bye crazies.
