I didnt really do anything exciting and i forgot all about my lil job i do, packing those pics in those plastic baggie things. dammit, i have 300 to do and i've done 5..the other day. lol Theres no will power to make money anymore. i mean, i know that sounds CRAZY and i love money yes i do, but i just dont want to do it! lol I found these cute lil pink guages at Hot Topic, they're adorable but they're size 16..thats kinda like a regular earring, but the last guages i had were a 14. so i kinda want pink 14s. I didnt even ask if they had them a size bigger, so i'll prob go back later when i have more time and look. i havent spend a time of any of the money ive made so far this summer and its killing me. like, as soon as i think im gonna spend some of the money i change my mind..what the hell is wrong with me? i have no fuckin clue. lol   I saw madison today at his work. i thought he'd be off of work but he was working late. hes such a hot dork. u wanna know what he was wearing? he was wearing these lite blue faded TIGHT ass jeans,(lauern think josh's jeans from hot vegas...)and he had on black and white converse sneakers and an orange shirt and to top it all off..a bright green rugrats watch. lol hes such an...errr...unique person. lol hes adorable!   Yup...nothing else is going on. lol I did buy some new black shoes to wear with my skirts and stuff, they're for the wedding in 2 weeks where i will see almost my whole family on my dad's side. as in my cousins who are my age and stuff...yay. Well back to the shoes. they are black with like 5 inch super tall heels no lie. lol its almost hard to walk in them. but they are soo cute. lol they are shiny black. i also got some anklets (silver) one is just a silver one with a lil dressy charm on it. and the other is stars and lil diamond lookin things. they're both cute. buy one get one free from claires. haha Im tryin to imagine how my family will react to my outfit for the wedding...i doubt my mom would never let me wear what im going to wear to a wedding HAHA. its the black shirt with the pink dots and a lil black shirt with a cardigan (pink). its a cute outfit but it reminds me of something a punk chick would wear when she has to dress up. lol oh well, rock on.   *much love and rugrat watches*
