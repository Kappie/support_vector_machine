"The time is always right to do what is right" - Martin Luther King, Jr "There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere." - Issac Asimov "I hope I never gert so old I get religous." Ingmar Bargman. "Shyness has a strange element of narcissism, a belief that how we look, how we perform, is truly important to other people."  - Andre Dubus. "I wash my hands of those who imagine chattering to be knowledge, silence to be ignorance, and affection to be art." - Kahil Gibran. "The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers and cities; but to know someone here and there who thinks and feels with us, and though distant, is close to us in spirit - this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden."
