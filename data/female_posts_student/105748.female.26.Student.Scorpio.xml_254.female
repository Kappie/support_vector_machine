I didnt watch it in the movies due to mixed reviews but this was awesome.  Brian would want to watch this film.  Oh and if you will watch this in surround sound it will sound like WHOA!!!  =)  Ching, are you going to wear a crown or a tiara? My sister wore one on her wedding.  I thought it was a finishing touch to a perfect day.    This is my second NEW Year's that I have not made the ER's top ten alcohol poisoning story.  I made it through my brother-in-law's party without drinking a single alcoholic drink inspite of the taunting and temptation.  I did get into the Merengue and Cha-cha sessions.      My coworkers have told me that security in TIMES SQUARE was strict and extreme.  You could not even get a back pack in the area.  Im glad the party when on without a hitch.    HERE's to a wonderful NEW YEAR ~
