I went to school at 10:30 to work on the Nationalist.  That went well, I did a bunch of photo editing which Mr. Powers taught me how to do and then sorta left me to do on my own.  I was a bit scared I'd mess it up or wouldn't do it right because he's real picky about everything.  But after that I drove to the Orthodontist.  Yuck!  The lady was real bitchy.  I got a lecture about how I should wear my rubberbands more.  Maybe it's the inner rebel in me, but I hate wearing them and at times downright refuse to!  When I came home I did homework which is always fun to do on your day off from school.  I fell asleep at around 4 and woke up around 7 in time for '8 Simple Rules.' I love that show.  It is so sad that John Ritter died.    Comments on Renae's Blog: I am not a freak!  Well, yes I am a neat freak but not a freak!  On the occasion of Ross...we are very disappointed.    Britney Spears drives me insane!  I can't believe that someone could make a career out of dancing because Lord knows she can't sing.  How is dancing helping humanity?  How is it contributing to society?  It's not!    Tomorrow is my nephew, Andy's, birthday.  He'll be 6.   I love my nephews to death!  Funny enough, I still have the crown from my 6th birthday at daycare.  Because my birthday is in the summer, so I wasn't in school.  I love having a summer birthday...I get no homework!   I can't wait till Saturday night we're gonna have so much fun!  What's the countdown now, Renae, 3 days?    I think I'm gonna go get some more sleep now.  Good Night!
