You can't bring a nail file, manicure scissors, a pen kinfe, or anything else that is potentially pointed and sharp.  But you know what you can bring on a plane?  Up to four books of matches and two cigarette lighters.  Because, you know, there's no risk in bringing fire-starting materials on a plane.  And besides that, it's not like anyone has ever tried to light an explosive device in an airplane cabin, right?  Of course not.  That's just crazy talk.  Other stuff: The words "Have you lost weight?" always make me a happy camper.  Someone at work said those words to me earlier this week, and sure enough, I have.  I'm down to 184 pounds, which is the weight I was at when I left high school.  A year ago at this time, I was 225, which I had been for a while, and I finally decided to do something about it.  I'm almost at the point where I want to be.  It makes me feel better about myself to know that I can accomplish something like this.  Since I've been given my notice to leave, I've picked up on something.  When I've come home the past couple weeks, I find that my bedroom door is closed.  Why is Matt doing this?  The only reason I can figure out is that this makes it easier for him to pretend that I already don't live there.  If he can't see my room or my things, he can't see me, right?  Doesn't stop him from playing College Football on my PS2 four nights a week, though.  Last night, after working at the station and dinner with the fam, I was looking for a little stress relief.  It may sound odd, but what relaxes me like few other things do is pinball.  I've been playing pinball since I wasn't even tall enough to see the playfield.  I have a memory of being about 3 years old and standing on one side of the table, pushing one flipper button while my dad pushed the one on the other side.  So I went to a local place, cashed in a couple of bucks for tokens, and played away.  It's so hard to find a pinball machine these days.  A lot of arcades don't even have them any more, and those that do usually only have one or two shoved into some out-of-the-way corner.  I found myself playing on a machine with a bunch of lights burned out, and only one completely functional flipper.  Well, that's no fun.  So I blew the rest of my tokens on Skee Ball (and they had the cannon version of Skee Ball too, please tell me someone else remembers that), grabbed my driver out of the trunk, and headed out to the driving range with a small bucket of balls.  I have no delusions about my ability as a golfer: I flat-out suck at it.  I only have a driver, specifically for going out on the range.  The club is my dad's, from a set he had when he used to caddy, meaning that it's about 47 or 48 years old.  I played actual golf a few times when I was younger, and I despised it.  Mark Twain had it right: "Golf is a good walk spoiled."  I'm sure as hell not going to drop a grand on a set of clubs for myself.  So, I spent some time hitting balls around 50 yards each, rarely if ever sending them straight, occasionally whiffing entirely, but whatever, it's a good time.  And I did hit one dead-on for about 125.  The next time I interact with a golf ball, though, I'd like it to be on astroturf, with a putter, surrounded by friends and a bunch of wacky obstacles.  Now that's the essence of the sport.  Since I still had some time to kill before the 10:15 show, I did what any respectable human being doing his damnedest to avoid going home would do: I went to Target.  Man, am I going to drop a bunch of money there on Saturday.  They have a huge section of dinner plates and glasses for 50% off - guess I just figured out how I'm going to stock my new kitchen.  Plus Grey clued me in to the fact that they have the new DMB live release for under $15, so I just have to buy it, right?  (The DVD has the video for  Grace is Gone  on it.  I'm sold.)  Target being the evil, tempting place that it is though - will I be able to fight the urge to buy a pair of Pac-Man swim trunks, the greatest looking things ever?  Only time will tell.  Oh, and by the way, according to those quizzes, I'm a "Dominant" kisser and my heart is "Red".  Whatever that means.
