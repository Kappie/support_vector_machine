But, as I said, this flirtation is occurring in unusually copious amounts. Therefore, I am worried. Because, for various reasons, this cannot continue. I suppose the most important one is that he has something of a mop on top of his head ^^; And another is that The Promiscuous One has a mini-crush on him (or so I think).   So. T proposed to Frodo. Funny as hell, that. None of us are quite sure what Frodo's response means. But apparently he had a big smile on his face, so we're all assuming that's a good sign and there will soon be wedding bells ringing in the air ^^; Of course, he  also  hasn't 'gotten back to her yet.' Maybe he'll call her tonight? Either way, though, I think it went rather well. If it turns out he doesn't like the idea of marriage, maybe they'll take it slow. Or maybe T'll get over him. Or maybe he does like that idea, so they'll get married and have many short and hairy children, bless the li'l buggers. He didn't seem to be acting that strange later on in the day though; I don't know what that means. T is convinced Frodo likes SH, but I'm convinced he likes MO. Whatever. I'd rather he like SH than MO, because I like SH better. Best of all would be that he liked T (or me!! ^^;), but dazok. I'm just laying out the options, see.   A wants me to slaughter cows to appease the gods. Iunno about that. What about that whole animal cruelty movement?   I handed in my civics essay today. Almost forgot to number the pages (thank you Mr Y for giving me back the essay so I could!!), but I did, so a tragedy was averted. I have to write a French poem for tomorrow. I find this ridiculously stupid, but I find lots of things ridiculously stupid, so that isn't too much out of the norm.   Hey, guess what! I'm listening to SOAD today. I heard them on the radio yesterday morning (yayy! Go 102.1!!), and I was completely reminded of their existence. It's very nostalgic right now ^^; All I need is a tube of really cheap lip gloss in front of my nose, and it'll be like gr. 8 again! I only wore lip gloss as my make-up in gr. 8. That, and a tiny tiny tiny bit of cover-up for the gaping black holes beneath my eyes. Damn those allergies. I'd look like a corpse without my cover-up lol.   Now I'm burning stuff to appease the gods. I think these gods have way too high standards. How about I not say their name in vain or something??   S helped me with my comp. sci ISU after school today. Thank you!! It works and everything now, except he with his boundless genius did it a different way than the teacher told me to. Now I gotta figure out this new way of doing things, and try to make it look like it was me who wrote it... nah. Mr M will know. But hopefully he'll realize I only got help, and that S didn't just write the whole thing for me. Stupid sorting! I am not a programmer, dammit! I am a kid who needed a third subject to pass gr. 10! I might be doing superbly well in this course, but I definitely don't have the right mindset for it. This is insanity!!   Excuse me, comrades, I need to go grab some incense for the sacrificial rituals... (??) rofl.
