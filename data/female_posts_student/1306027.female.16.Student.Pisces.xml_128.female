It's so awesome.       Anyways, on to  my story of the day:     Today, I went to work. Sounds exciting eh? Well, it gets better. I had to work 9-2, which is not so bad, but when you combine that with other contributing factors such as who you work with, how stupid the customers were, and whether or not you were fully stocked, you will usually get how much your day sucks. Let me give you the equation...            Hours worked  x  Customer stupidity  x  Half Stock  x  Crappy Co-workers  =  The Suck Factor of My Day.          Pretty simple eh?  Well, you would think so. To put it lightly- My day sucked. I usually run coffee station but today they put the new Meghan on coffee station (big mistake.. you never stick new people on coffee station.. your asking for trouble). And Rex told me to help Mary in the front. I absolutely abhor front. I hate it I hate it I hate it! When I am at coffee station I don't have to talk to anyone.. I just pour coffee. But when I run front I not only have to talk to people, I have to look at them and get yelled at by them too. It's all too much. I loathe front. LOATHE! There are many disadvantages too working front. Not only do you get yelled at more often, but you also never get anything done! Line's form out of no where whenever you take a minute just to stock something. I remember, I was stocking donuts earlier today and all of the sudden 5 people walked up into the line! I mean, our customers are like sharks. When sharks smell blood your dead meat (literally). Our customers are the same way only, when they smell fresh donuts than your dead meat (literally).         Ok, so, people  have to eat. This is something I understand. And people don't always want to make their food, another something that I understand. But- why can't people just make their own muffins? I mean really... is it worth all the effort to stand in line for 20 minutes just to order a muffin and then yell at the server because that certain type of muffin wasn't there? It's like....      God, I am so sorry that I am not PSYCHIC and that I couldn't PREDICT that you wanted that PARTICULAR muffin at this PARTICULAR time of the day. Can I offer you a different type of muffin? Perhaps our all to famous KISS MY A** Muffin?? And no, we do not accept credit cards as a form of payment......      I mean, It's  like the longer I work the stupider people get. It surprises me how really and truly stupid some people are. For example:    Lady comes through the drive- throught the other day and asks for a banana nut muffin toasted with butter. Now, as many people of normal intelligence know, you cannot toast a muffin. The little muffin crumbs would fall to the bottom of the toaster and catch on fire, possible causing the whole building to go up with it. Katie turned to me and said she couldn't handle that lady so I made sure to pronunciate myself very clearly "MA'AM WE CANNOT TOAST OUR MUFFINS, I CAN HOWEVER, HEAT IT UP IN THE MICROWAVE." She answered back to me like I was the stupid one- "You can't TOAST A MUFFIN?!". I told her to pull around. Anyways, at the window emily goes to hand her muffin out and she looks in the bag, and then hands it back and say's "O, I didn't want a Muffin, I wanted a bagel!" I seriously thought Katie was gonna jump out the drive through window and strangle that lady. We don't even carry banana-nut bagels. God. How can someone be so incredibly stupid?         And people have  the nerve to ask me why Im so uptight all the time. Well, let me tell you, if you were stuck in a room with 5 of my stupid customers for just 5 minutes... I guarantee that you would be uptight too.        Thus concludes my  rantage of the day.         Mojo
