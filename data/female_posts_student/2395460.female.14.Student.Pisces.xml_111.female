You're all set to make a splash for summer, save one thing...  those lingering thoughts that you should 1) protect your investment in your new phone, and 2) please your mother by making sure all of your accessories match.  There's only one problem...  cell phone cases come in black, black, or black.  Though we mustn't eschew the value of black, it just doesn't evoke any vision of sassy, summer fun.  Along comes Vaja to save the day!  Need a phone case in pistachio?  A PDA case in latte?  An iPod case in dark citron?  You've got it!  A quick visit to  urlLink Vaja Cases  and you're on your way.  Vaja offers the finest quality cases in all sorts of interesting 'off the rack' colors.  Not good enough?  Customize a case for only a few dollars more and choose from no less than seven different leathers and dozens of colors.  You can even go two-tone!  Custom orders can take a little extra time, so if you're going this route, think fall!
