     
      The tears that I have cried are present in the mist;  Flowing with the morning dew and bliss.  Feel my heart beating with the fruitful earth;  My mind racing again back from birth.   Life goes on like a flowing river;  Love survives although the world is bitter.  Hope emerges with the new beginning;  But you are still in my heart's ending.   I have decided not to go with the flow;  But against the wind's tremendous blow.  My body may break but my spirit will not;  Refuse to withdraw from the battle's shot.
