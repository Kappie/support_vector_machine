At least I've got the attire for my new challenge.  And at least I'll look cute!    So I'm currently able to run two miles, okay almost two miles, and I've got to get up to 13 for the half marathon.  Now, I guess I could've prepared and started getting back into running last week, but did I? No, I spent the last week working on finishing a cake that I bought.  I did pretty good, I might add.  I ate it all.  It was tough, I had to eat two pieces of cake everday.  Now that's a challenge!
