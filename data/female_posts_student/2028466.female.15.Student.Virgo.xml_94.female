Speeding off, they crash into the side of a barn, immediately jump out of the car and hide under potato sacks.  The cop charges in after them and comes across the first potato sack, where the brunette is hiding under. He kicks it and the brunette says, "MEEEEOOOOOOW." "Oh!", the cop says, "it's just a stupid cat."  He then moves to the potato sack the red-head is under and kicks it. The red-head replies, "WOOF, WOOF." The cop, angry now, says, "STUPID DOG!!"  Then the cop gets to the potato sack the blonde is under, he kicks it with great force and the blonde screams,  ...."POOOOOTAAAAATOOOOOO!"
