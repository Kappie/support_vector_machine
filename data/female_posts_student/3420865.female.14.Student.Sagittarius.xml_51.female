(props to vanessa.)  wow i've had a cool last couple of days...yes, i must admit, i haven't sat around at home! yes. i know. shocking.  so last night, me and erin went out for chinese! yes. it was sweet... her mom drove us there after i got dropped off at her house, and we ate...a lot. cuz it was the buffet. we had like 2 plates full, then desert...and erin had to take like every kind of desert there was. but it turned out that she didn't really like anything but the jello...aha yeah.  then after dinner, we walked back to her house. yes. walked. we walked all the way from china park, down willow, down paisley, down stephanie, then up rochelle, cuz i had this amazing idea to go call on ray...cuz he has no friends and would most likely be home.  so we went to ray's house, then we walked to st. francis...ray was being a bit quieter than he usually is cuz he was "tired"...psht. then we stayed at st. francis for like half an hour(?) and we asked ray loads of questions like what he looks for in a girl and stuff...and he was kindof uncomfortable with it...ahaha you should have seen his face. baha.  then after giving ray the spanish inquisition, we walked to beckers/mac's and me and erin bought drinks...and while we were standing in line, we all contemplated whether or not to believe the tabloids when they said that mary-kate is, in fact, on cocaine...and not anorexic. but whatever.  so after that, we walked back to st. francis...where i threw coins at ray. t'was fun. then we started walking towards the forest and stephanie park, and we saw these lights coming from the forest...and all of a sudden this jeep drove out...it was wierd/scary. then we walked through the forest in the dark, while i thought (out loud) about how the bushes were big enough to hide a grown man (preferably a rapist/murderer). it was pleasant. then we got to taylor evan's, and ray chased this little bunny around for like 5 minutes...it was so cute...and so scared. poor guy.  then we semi-walked ray home, and me and erin walked through the field at springdale park back to her house...then we sat in her kitchen for like 10 minutes until my mum picked me up. it was, overall, a sweet night.  so today...woke up at like 11:30, had a shower, got dressed, and watched tv with my dad...then erin called me and asked me to go to the mall, then we did...at like 3. so before i went, i played the sims for like 2 hours. (wow time flies  really  fast when you're playing that game...no joke.)  then i met erin at the mall, and we shopped...she bought sandals and serum (ahaha) and i bought 2 shirts and 2 necklaces...with money to spare. then we had fries...then my brother picked us up. then i had dinner, watched girl with the pearl earring...kindof a good movie...just kindof.  oh wow. ok so my dad's turning 50 this year (in september) so we're going to new orleans...yeah. for his birthday. sweet eh? i'm excited.  so. 15 days till england/wales. and 7 days till i get my braces off. wow, the time goes by really quickly.  so anyways. quotes.  "would you like a fork?"-chinese lady at china park. "yes please."-me, erin. *brings back a knife.*-chinese lady.  "haha i dare you to throw your jello at that woman."-me, talking about a lady who just walked into the restaurant. "haha i'd do it for money."-erin...aha it was funny cuz she kindof emphasized "it"...but yeah.  "you'd think they would have realized that there's no road by now."-ray, talking about the jeep coming out of the forest.  "it could've had a heart attack!"-me, talking about the bunny. "...oh well."-erin  anyways. i'm going to bed now...paice.  this is a love song... deal with it.  kayte.
