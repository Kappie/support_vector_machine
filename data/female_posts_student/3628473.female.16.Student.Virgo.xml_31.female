There was just so much i wanted to read, but yet so little... I didn't want to get a big book cause i didn't thinki was going to read it. So i got an meduim book. Which is ok. But i need to get book, and read them! But i first grabed C.S lewis, cause the truth is i want to read one of his books, however, he seems like a very smart guy, someone that i wouldn't be able to keep up with, thinking wise... I'm not saying i'm stupid, just i have to re-read one line from his book about 4 different time just to understand what he is saying, then i could start thinking about it... Then i was going to get a smaller book, and i really wanted to, i loved the last one i read. From the same writer. I called him Dude... But the guy really just got to me, and i got thinking... but i didn't. Then i was going to get a book about dating... "Dateble" I hread it was really good, and i do want to read it, but a thought came to mind. I'm not waiting to deal withmy dating stuff. I mean yea it blows, but i am not good at dating. The whole thing. Meeting...Friendships, courting, dating, closeness...all of it... Why you may ask...I dont know. Maybe i'm just not happy with who i have datied so far. My eyes seem to have been closed for some time now, and i was just slapped by Kyle... Now seeing that there is guys out that, that i have been looking for. Speaking of Kyle... About a week ago we were talking about how much we wanted to date. and he said something that i was thinking about a week before him and i even started talking that day. "I think God put you in my life just so i can know what to look for"....All i could say is wow. Him and i talk about things i have been thinking about, but i dont even have to bring it up, he does... But it was true. I think God put that on OUR hearts, to let us no, there is no chance for you two, but there is a chance for you and someone else, just like this person. And to tell you the truth, that is a bummer. Cause i haven't found him yet. But thats ok. More time for me to perpare for him, and perpare for my God...     A thought came to my while i was reading. "I'm going to war..." Scary? Well for all those Christians out that reading this... Your going too! But i am being perpared for war... Aganist Satan i mean. Now i have a thought, and i dont know if it is true or not... But when the end comes. When G-man comes down and juges those dead and not dead, we all in heaven and on earth that believe have to go anainst the prince of darkness (like that!) But i have a different battel, starting Aug. 23... School. Wow... What am i going to do this next year? Am i going to go to a place where morals dont always top the charts on peoples listes of life... Am i going to sit there, and be conterable?I shouldn't be... I have gotten to the place where i am very comfterable. I mean wow! This is easy. Why... Cause the only people i talk to about God are people who already know him... And those who dont know him that talk to me, about wanting to get to know him, i sheepisly shy away from the convo... So how am i going to live this next year out? Am i going to look back on it and say, no different? Well i know that i'm not going to be willing to go out there, cause i am not going to be welcomed all the time, but theres going to be one person. that one person that says man, God i want you... And guess what... i need to think thats worth every bit of it...      So about trusting god... I do a crappy job of it. So hopfully i will get better at it...
