The other one was the FOOD FEISTA, the food was so yum, yum and delicious. I tried the french fries with cheese sauce with my family, then had the penang laska, so spicy!! And then I had the Jollie Bean soya bean mixed with grass jelly, so sweet. And then, again, I had the portuguese tart, so different from egg tarts, I LOVE IT!!! I was so already so full and still my family and I went to Little India, the new shopping mall and had dinner  again . And we went to the shopping market where the suff were cheap, cheap and cheap! And I the Scott Plush Dog, so cute!! But you have to buy at least 2 jumbo tissue. Well, all for the sake of me....
