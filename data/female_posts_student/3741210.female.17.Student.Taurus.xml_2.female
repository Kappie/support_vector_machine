I want to read more of Pride and Prejudice, my friends really don't like the book (even some who haven't even started it claim they don't like it) so I think they want to change it to The Notebook because its an easy read and then we could go see the movie.  Give Jane Austen a chance people!  Its a classic for crying outloud, enduring through the centuries.  Of course last time two people ahem*catie,Kelly*cough didn't read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya sisterhood.  I just wonder if we'll ever have a meeting where everyone has read the book. Now watch, next meeting, I'll be the only person who didn't read it after all this complaining. My mommy is making me some eggs and ham.  Yum!  How many of you out there have Moms like mine?  Not many I presume.  For our first book club meeting, she did the whole thing while I was at work.  Decorations, food.  What can I say? The woman's a saint Any work is better when you've got the people at home cheering you on.  Breakfast is ready. Bye all.
