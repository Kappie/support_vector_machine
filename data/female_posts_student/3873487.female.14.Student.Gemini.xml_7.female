She's an American Eskimo, all white, with dark dark caramel eyes, a lil pink bald spot near her nose, and has the  sweetest  personality. So far, since Tuesday (that is) she's been making alot of progress. On thursday morning, she wouldn't eat or do anything, no poopy or pee. So that whole day i was basically at my mom's work, waiting to take her to the vet to be examined. I was semi worried about her to tell the truth, because I get he fact that she's realizing ( very   very   very  slowly) that this isn't a trip to a firends house for a day, this is a new home with a new enviroment, new rules, and new family. When we arrived at Layhil Animal Hospital, the examinations began. The staff there was super super nice and they loved Camille! They weighed her, and she lost about a pound and a half... I'm scared for her. One of the staff tld us to go into one of the examination rooms, and she showed us how to apply the flea medication, and then the terror began. They did the physical examination on her (so the appointment on Monday at 5pm is useless) and  OMG  they had to take a poopy and blood sample from her. I can't stand it when dogs cry... it makes you want drop on the floor and start crying hysterically. I've never seen a poopy sample in action, and the moments when Camille was held back and crying and whinning as if she was an inch from a vicious, bloody death... I seriously had teared up and wanted to run to her and hug her to tell her to shoosh. It was crazy to watch the doctor stick a stick up Camille's butt just to get a poopy sample. I mean how can u even dig that far up?? Or down for that matter?? It hurt lie shit, I could tell. The bloody sample was much easier, but if something as painful as that happened to me in one day, I'd commit suicide. Then after the tests results were back, she doesn't have heartworm, so she's completely healthy ^^. That day, we spent like almost close to $100 for her medications and stuff... damn we're spending alot on her... or more like my mommy. I do feel really bad that she has to pay for everything, and especially when we just got back from vacation, fixing our air conditioning, fixing our toilet and sink, and her new jewelery. THings that a mommy will do for their children so they can have everything they didn't have when they were young, and most importantly to be happy. I hate it how I couldn't work this summer, when I need it the most since I got  MY  dog and everything. It almost seems like my mommy only got Camile to make me happy. Mommy I'm grateful and completely happy that your always there for me to love this crazy ass babie girl, but you really don't have to do all this for me, make me do stuff, yell at me!!! I know I can piss you off and all, but I'm only me, and I'm only human, and as a human doing so much for someone who doesn't deserve this much... well it's just feels really  wrong .
___Tomorrow we have to go to Gilbert's abandoned house to mow their lawn... I hope they're having fun in China, because I could have gone with them.  DAMN YOU PASSPORT !!!!! Badminton was great today, I did pretend again, but it felt like what I was supoosed to do, so I just kept at it. I know Gene cares because he'll ask me if anythin gis wrong and if I wanted to talk to him about it. But today, after I said "no", he sorta just left with an "ok". That hurt hunny, that really did...
