I did, however, drive to Midtown(ish) in Atlanta to see the guys (of Five Star Iris) at the Black Bear Tavern. I was singing their praises before, but I'd only heard them electric--which can have the tendency to mask any imperfections (if there are any.) But I finally got the hear them acoustic, and it was twice as great as an electric show. I got to meet Alan's wife, who is the world's nicest person, and all their great friends/fans from Atlanta. Not to mention the place was totally cool. If ever in the 1900 block of Peachtree Rd NE in Atlanta, I highly suggest stopping by. The food is great, the bartenders are quick and its virtually idiot free. I hate Columbus.  Speaking of things I hate. I gave my notice at the skate center on Saturday night. I came to this heavy realization Friday as I was making the drive between Atlanta and Newnan: I'm an adult. Sure, I was the manager of the skate center, but I had to work until 11 or 12 on Friday and/or Saturday night. Working at the skate center was causing me to miss out on things like dropping everything and driving to Atlanta to see 5SI. Atlanta is so close. If it weren't for my huge environmentally unfriendly gas guzzling vehicle, I'd go every weekend. And I just can't do that if I'm bossing around 17 year olds who complain about everything until 11 pm on Friday and Saturday. I'm tired of working 6-7 days a week. I want to be able to have 2 days off like the rest of the working world. So I shall. Bitches.  Well, off to bed. I need some sleep as I have started my diet today, and eating right makes me pissy. I need to make sure I sleep as much as possible so I don't have that working to make me pissier. Plus I have to go to work at 12 tomorrow for some stupid ass luncheon to thank us for all our hard work. Its appreciated-definately-anything to keep me from working. But my job is much like the movie "Office Space." Except we don't have to take our cubicles apart, they're falling apart on their own.  Peace homies!
