I think I may go to the lake tomorrow during the day... then training orientation is at 6:30 at the office.  That should be interesting. Well, the only other thing I really wanted to blog about from this past week was about  urlLink Ray Charles'  death.  He died on Thursday, 10 June 2004.  I'm just glad that I got to see him in concert before he died.  I saw him in 2003 @ the rodeo.  That is all for now
