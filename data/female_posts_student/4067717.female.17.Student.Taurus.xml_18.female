Never when I go for one of those 12-hour naps, and never when I don't get more than three hours. *sigh* Anyway, last night I dreamed that a bunch of people I didn't know, Eddie and I were all on the run, in Tiffany's car, because Eddie had seen a mob guy kill someone. This was a very strange dream, but pretty fun, because most of the time we were sitting around in this "safe house" ducking from windows. And then, of course, the alarm had to go off.  I am typing this when I should be fixing breakfast to get me through another day of band camp. Sarah, I will mail your Guns 'n' Roses CD tomorrow. Will that make you feel better?
