Well, for Reading I got -5, language -8, math -8, science -9, filipino -5 and chinese -6.75. Boy, my scores are pretty weird.. 3 subjects I got 8 mistakes? Bummer.. Just because there were stoopeeed corrections. My grades would be a little higher. Hahaha! XDDD Damn! I have to make a stooooopeeeeed speech for Filipino and it's worth 20 pts.! Doesn't Gng. Versoza have anything to do than bored us to death? I fell asleep during her class a while ago! Daaang. We were copying down notes that time! Good thing when I woke up, I didn't skip anything. That nap was toooooo short. Heehee. Homework is killing me. Damn. Gawd.. i'm so bored. I wish I'm living in my own fantasy which is better than reality. Lol. CHAD MICHAEL MURRAY would be in my fantasy. I sound too desperate for him. Ughh.. I'm confused.. I don't feel happy all of a sudden. It's like my life isn't....right. Total weirdness I say. I'm signing off..
