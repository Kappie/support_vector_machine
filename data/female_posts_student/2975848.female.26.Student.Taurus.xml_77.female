Uncertain path I follow alone Each step I fear the next Don’t know how much more I can take Don’t know where I find this strength  Sliced heart bleeding one tear for everyday apart Still beating strong hoping you back  Suffocating terror throws me into the ground I try to stand up again But sometimes the weight is too heavy And I keep lying in the ground
