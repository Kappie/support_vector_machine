Me, Lisa, and Deidra just talked the whole time. But..when I got to see the play i was like....dee...pass me that joint.lol the actors were actually pretty good.ONe of them looked like Clay Aiken lol. but..this guy looked much better. Damn...my mom's on the phone with my uncle talking about them coming to see us on Sat. and i told ryan i'd call him when i was done with my project lol. Grr...mom talks for HOURS...but so do I. With some ppl i talk like crazy with them..cuz well we usually have very *interesting*conversations but for others i talk for about 10-15 mins. One time me and Deidra talked about ppl dieing the whole time lol.  *hey negro*
