We went to the Casey Indoor Sports centre today.. had a choice of indoor soccer or beach volleyball. Being sports retarded I choice beach volleyball with my mates. It was actually quite fun until Jess O'leary pegged a ball at my head and was acting like a total bitch to me all day. Fuck YOU! Weird thing happened today. Everyone was provoking Rory to ask me out, and he did. Then everyone else told me to say no so I just acted it out. I think he actually meant it. I think I sound like a whore in this blog.. I'm not. I've had 1 boyfriend in my whole life, I like 2 guys and the rest is jabber.. So, no, I am not a whore. Coming to this blog is a few changes.. Gunna HTML it up a bit. Will probably change the stupid name too. :D I'm also going back to my roots and starting painting and drawing again. I don't know what happened, but I've totally lost it. Gunna start writing more too. :) Shizenhousen. Steph.
