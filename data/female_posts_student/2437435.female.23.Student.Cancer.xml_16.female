But oh well, I'd say I have my health, but I'm not feeling well. I'd say I have my friends, but I am just not going there... I have most of my friends and I thank God for them. And I will leave family and school out of this. At any rate, here is an exerp from a story I'm working on.  Please tell me the good and bad parts.   She was in a frenzy to get away from everyone she could. It pained her to be around anyone, even to be seen. She always felt alone, and that was this was the climax of her moments. But now, she craved to stay alone but couldn't. She tried to stop crying, the tears wouldn't. She tried to calm down, her heart told her it shouldn't. He kept following her and she tried to get him to stop. Finally, she gave in. She warned him about her moods and that he didn't want to be around. He replied he wanted to be there for her and she said she didn't. Then in a flash, it seemed like he knew she would hurt him more than ever, and he told her he would see her later. This broke her broken heart further. She thought he didn't care even when he said he did, and now it seemed absolute that he didn't. She had no right to be further upset, but she desperately wanted to believe him and only him. She wanted him to make everything all right, to take her in his arms and calm her. Now, she was devastated. As he turned and walked away, she stared in disbelief. Just as he turned back, she left. Resolute not to give in to anyone; to stay with her emotions alone. She was the only one here now. She is all she knows; she is the shroud of mystery, to herself especially.     "   She walked a ways, and it seemed that she couldn't remember where she was , or where she was going. She finally sat down on the street corner. Her eyes moved up the street to an unusual figure. A woman across the lane holding her child. The brown hair interlocked in the rough hard hands of the mother. The face was scrunched against her chest with his eyes closed as if he were in a deep sleep. But this looked strange, the mother was not singing a lullaby. She was screaming frantically and at the top of her lungs and shaking. Her voice and body shook violently as her tear stained face showed the rawest of pain. The sights and sounds sent chills up and down the spines of everyone within an earshot range.   Who would dare to go near this grieving mother? There was a helpless hopelessness in the abundant in the air this evening, and it seemed to foretell of the season to follow.       "
