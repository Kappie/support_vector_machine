Our teacher's name was Tu (I don't know how to spell it, but it sounds like "two"). He had Asian emo-boy hair, he was so freaking hot. Anyways, he kept doing routines I liked and I kept shouting, "Tu, you're the one!" I dunno, I thought it was funny. Then Elizabeth almost ran him over and I yelled, "If you ran over Tu, there'd be none!" That was great. He was hot. When I was at my Grandma's we were planning to go to a family BBQ. My aunt Sharon told my mom to call my aunt Sue and invite her. And my grandma, who sits at home all day long, said, "Yeah, because they have NO life!" It was soo funny! Last night was the The Underground Network/The Matches/Maxeen/Matchbook Romance concert. Oh it was great! It was at Flanagan and I didn't like that. We got there at like 4... not even one band was there yet. Anna was supposed to have an interview with Maxeen and we got to go along. We had it with Tom, oh my he is GORGEOUS! I'm not kidding, his face is just so pleasant. The table only had two chairs, so he pulled another two up. He was such a gentleman, oh they raise them right in Akron, Ohio. He was really articulate too and gave really good answers. She asked him what he was like in high school, and I just started to laugh. He looked over and I was like, "Oh sorry, I just really hate high school." WHAHAHA. The concert started like four hours later, oooooooooo the wait was annoying. This girl ran up to a member of Matchbook Romance and grabbed and hugged him. Then she asked where he was in Chicago, and he said stoically, "I was there." Then they stood for like a minute in silence and he just walked away. It was really embarrassing for her. The Underground Network was really good. They're from "Lorain fucking Ohio" and the lead singer was pretty cute. He had a truck driver hat on with a picture of Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. and it said "Dumb and Dumber". The Matches were AWESOME! The lead singer had this crazy hair that was all combed over to one side and spiky. He was a fox. They spit on us a lot. Maxeen was also really good. When Tom sings he bounces and it's really cute. When they were setting up MBR I saw a pick and asked for it. WOO HOO GOT IT ON MY OWN! The crowd got crazy for MBR. There were these boys, I've never seen anybody get more excited for a band than them. They were screaming to the lead singer about how hot he is and how much they love him. A pick fell and this boy pushed everybody down and practically climbed on stage to get it. They were nice though, one kept saying he was sorry that I was in the front and getting pushed. I told him, "Oh I don't mind when you use me to propel yourself into the air, but the sudden punches are what scare me!" I also grabbed a pic. Anna and I were really raped. Boys are gross, I don't like their touch. Eww. At one point, I just felt something climbing down my chest. I look down, and one of the boys was literally grabbing me, it was creepy as hell. But I laughed a lot. But I was also scared, because they were pushing me forward, and the bassist kept bending down with his bass right in my face. I was positive I was going to get pushed and slam my head right against it. Every time it got close I screamed, and I think he saw. Everybody started screaming for them to play "Tiger Lily" and he was like "how did you know?" And Elizabeth shouts, "It's on the playlist!" And he goes, "You're not supposed to read that! You're a cheater!" And everybody was screaming cheater... it was so funny! But then he like had a conversation with her about her shirt and promised to give her the list after the show. Of course some other girl got it, but she told him and he got her another one! Anna said to him, "I like your jellies" and he said, "You like my what?!?!!?" SHE MEANT HIS BRACELETS! IT WAS GREAT! The show didn't end till like 12:30... ahh! Then I showed Elizabeth how their song, "My Eyes Burn" is basically the story of my life. I think I will share the lyrics with you, read them and see if you can guess why:  My eyes burn from these tears You think you'd learn over these years Good things won't last forever  So what the hell am I suppose to do You only wanted the things I couldn't give to you And you had it all anyway  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  Tell me I'm wrong when I say I can't expect you to stay forever with me I live for that single moment  I take back everything I've said You wore those words on your lips As if they meant anything anyway  Sometimes I feel I could drop off the face of the earth It seems I do more harm than good And I don't know if it's worth me loosing sleep over this  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place  Tell me I'm wrong when I say it I can't expect you to spend forever with me I live for that single moment  So take take everything and leave me scrambling Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place [x2]  If you know me, you'll get it. Anyways we had Graduation practice today. It was funny. Lauren Smiley is the shit! Everybody was nice about my nose, they were proud of me. Love you kids! Well I'm out. Fall Out Boy tonight, but tomorrow HARRY FREAKIN POTTER! HELL YES.
