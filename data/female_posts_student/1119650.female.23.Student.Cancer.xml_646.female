Although the Rangers lost (surprise, surprise) it was still a really awesome game.  The last five minutes the crowd started to get really nuts and the whole place pretty much was on their feet.  There was the "Mess-i-er" cheers and lots and lots of screaming.  Finally, after the game Mess came out and bowed and thanked the crowd, shed a few tears.  It was really an amazing night.  Hard to recap the energy and emotion of the situation.    After that we (me, Andrew, Jimmy, Margaret, Todd, Vicki  her friend and the Senator) headed to Play by Play for some drinks.  Todd made some sort of hot sauce, bud light, mustard nugget concoction and acutally drank it (ew!) and then we had a round of TRIPLE SoCo and Lime shots.  On the train ride home Andrew made a passing comment that something was "glorious" and the guys behind us start trading Old School lines with him.  It was pretty funny to say the least.  A great night all around.  So here I am, home for the day becuase I have a "sinus headache", but I think I'm finally gonna get my ass to UConn and try and sort some things out.
