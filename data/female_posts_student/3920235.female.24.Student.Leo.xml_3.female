All in all, I was impressed with them because one of the girls didn't show up and one of the boys who hadn't been there for any of the practices did show up, and everything went smoothly.  Of course the rich, snobby bitches that sit at the front table (and are pretty much stuck up the prof's ass) went completely overboard with their skit and song.  I can't wait until they have to actually  earn  something that they want instead of having it just handed to them like everything else has been.  I need a shower before I go to work.  So here's something not many people know about me.  I like to smoke weed, and I have been just about every day for the past couple of months.  However, as much as I like getting high/stoned, I am giving it up.  For one thing, it's bad for my health.  But the real reasons that I'm giving it up are that I have too much going for me right now and I can't afford to fuck it up.  Weed makes me stupid.  I have very little short-term memory right now, and that's not a good thing at all.  Plus, starting on July 20 I'm going to be taking two math classes and if you know me, math is my worst subject.  I can't afford to fail these classes because if I do I can't student teach, and I won't be able to graduate in December.  Also, I've noticed that during the past few months I haven't really given a shit about what I'm doing.  Like I'm not sure if I even want to teach.  Part of it is burnout because I've been taking classes nonstop since last July, but a lot of it is the weed, too.  It's starting to make me lose focus.  I don't want that to happen.  I don't need that to happen.  Teaching is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life, and if I'm already starting to not care about it (or really not even want to do it) then the only thing I've done is waste a shitload of money, time, and effort.  So many people would be insanely disappointed in me.  Ultimately, I would be a total failure.  It's time that I take my priorities and place them in the right order, which is what I've made the conscious decision to do.  Will it be hard?  Of course.  It's always hard to stop doing something you have a good time doing.  But with patience and willpower, I can do it.  I  will  do it.  Thank you.
