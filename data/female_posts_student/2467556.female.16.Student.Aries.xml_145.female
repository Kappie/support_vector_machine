He said it gets really boring up there, so since i was on that side of town today, i decided to say hi.  I went in there once and looked through every aisle because he said that he stocked shelves etc, but i couldn't find him.  So i looked at Father's Day cards and bought a pack of gum so i wouldn't look retarded.  Then i went to the hair salon nearby and bought my dad this awesome smelling shampoo stuff....i think its the brand he really likes.  Then i decided to go back to the Tom Thumb and just ask where Kubic was.  So i go to the Customer Service and ask if he's working today, this random guy nearby that i assume works there was like "Yeah, he's upstairs, i can go get him to come down for a minute".  oh man then i felt reeeeeeeally stupid.  Now i look like i'm Kubic's a) girlfriend or b) stalker.  Not what i wanted at all.  I thought about running away, but then i thought that might be kinda mean.  So i waited and read the back of a Motrin box.  Then Kubic came down and he was like "Mercer! what are you doing here!?"  I was like "ummmm.....i told you i'd come visit you?"  He couldn't really talk because he was in training at that moment and i had no idea.  oops.  So then i was like well let me know about if we're going to do something wednesday night and he's like ok i'll ask my mom if i can drive tomorrow night blah blah blah.  i can't believe he asks me to do something but then he hasn't even really planned it or told his parents yet....oh well, typical guy i guess lol.  So then i left Tom Thumb feeling really stupid and embarassed that i called Kubic out of his training (that i had no idea about) just to be like "hey whats up".  grrr, oh well.  Alright about this wednesday night thing.  I was talking to Kubic the other day and i was like "you know what? we're friends but we never hang out together outside of parties of mutual friends that we're invited to" and he was like "I know, its sad, we should hang out sometime this week".  First we decide to go ice skating but then we went to the movie idea.  So this will be the first time outside of the cotillion days, school and mutual parties that he and I will have hung out.  crazy huh?  wow i am soooooo bored, i wish someone had a survey in their blog that i could steal so i would have something to do  dinner time!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
