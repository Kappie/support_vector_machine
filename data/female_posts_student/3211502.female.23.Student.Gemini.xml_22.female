So, anyways, today I was catching up in all of the SB reading that I have to do and I was reading the syllabus entry entitled "Endocrine Pancreas." In the syllabus, there was a brief discussion about the two different types of Diabetes Mellitus. As I was reading about diabetes, I thought back to my first encounter with diabetes...  When I was in elementary school, I was addicted to the Babysitters Club series. I loved reading about the adventures that Kristy, Mary Anne, Claudia, Stacey, Dawn, Jessi, and Mallory had with baby-sitting, school, boys, and family. I owned every book and eagerly awaited the release of the next books in the series. Anyways, in the third book in the series, entitled "The Truth About Stacey," I learned that Stacey, the transplant from NYC, had diabetes. Diabetes was the reason why she couldn't have sweets and had to go to the doctor all of the time. Aha!   And, from what I learned today in my SBPM reading, Stacey must have had Type I Diabetes Mellitus and had to have been controlling her disease with injections of insulin.
