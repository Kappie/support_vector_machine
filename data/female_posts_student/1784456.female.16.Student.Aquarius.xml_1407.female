She saw these banners on the way out of Southampton *worded wrong- it's hard to type, and sing along to things you know!* that said - George Bush the weapons of mash *yes I wrote mash* MASS even . Ok... so now it's ruined, let's start again. George Bush, the weapons of MASS destruction are here. Funny huh! Oh yeah... I forgot about all the backround information! Well Southampton are playing *or were* the FA Cup final today at Cardiff's ... *won't even try to spell* stadium. (Ok, so they lost but oh well) Have you ever had a dream where you're actually some one else? When I was younger I used to have it, I would get all worried because they wouldn't know anything about my house, where to go or what to do. Why didn't I just screw up there lives? Because I was too worried about them doing that to mine! Ok... so enough of the freak lesson that goes nowhere... I hear you, I hear you. Umm... I just kind of broke Kazaa... I'll just kick it a few times... *KABOOOM*
