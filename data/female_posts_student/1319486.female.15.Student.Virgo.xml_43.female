NO IT DOESN'T. i think it made it worse. then again, i haven't actually read the book, which is why i got it from the library to read it. i really hate amy. she is just a little slut that took her sister's guy. of course, it's just as much laurie's fault as it is amy's. but i could never be mad at laurie. except when he marries his true love's sister. that is very wrong.  if you were walking with a friend who was a tight rope walker and he fell, that would be completely unacceptable.  i like snacks from vending machines because they fall. if i buy a candy bar, often times i will drop it to achieve the maximum flavor potential.  i'm against picketing but i don't know how to show it.  My apartment is infested with koala bears. It's the cutest infestation ever. Way better than cockroaches. When I turn on the light, a bunch of koala bears scatter, but I don't want them too. I'm like, "Hey... Hold on fellows... Let me hold one of you, and feed you a leaf." Koala bears are so cute, why do they have to be so far away from me. We need to ship a few over, so I can hold one, and pat it on its head.   Every time I go and shave, I assume there is somebody else on the planet shaving as well, so I say, "I'm gonna go shave too."   I got my hair highlighted, because I felt some strands were more important than others.   The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I'll never be as good as a wall.   ^mitch hedburg  -stace
