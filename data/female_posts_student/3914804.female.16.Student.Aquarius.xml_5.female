Did not post last nite as spent "Internet time" talkin 2 Cesca and Seb, ah well. As nobody reads this, I'm sure there will be little disappointment!! Besides, I needed theconversation.To date, only Cesca, Dom and Seb are able 2 make me laugh out loud online! An impressive feat indeed.(You will note I am limiting myself to  less than 5 exclamation marks,  thus rendering critics unable 2 acuse me of insanity - merely eccentricity!          It'll be an uneventful day, as I am tired; however, I have promised my obnoxious brother to take him 2 the tennis courts later today,            May I just recommend white grape and ederflower Schloer which Cesca introduced me 2? It's very yummy!          It occurs to me that when one is young, there is the inclination to wish away your life, thinking it will improve with age. But when you pass a certain age - perhaps 20s? - you wish yourself back in time (not 2 your teenage years however, 4 obvious reasons!!)          Must dash, parents need phoneline. Tara!
