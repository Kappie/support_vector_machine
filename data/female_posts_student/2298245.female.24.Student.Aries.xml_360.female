There was one set of questions that totally blew my mind and confused me since I wasn't exactly sure what he was asking for, but hey, it happens, right?  Overall, I think I did OK, and most of all it is over.  Now to the real test of my will...one to go, and it's the hardest of all, the one I'll be least prepared for.  Oh, Lord, please just let me make it through.
