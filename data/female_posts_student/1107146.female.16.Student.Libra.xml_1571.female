Apparently I'm not studying enough for him. =P  Anyway  Zabeth,  I've been looking for the DVD, The Last of the Mohicans. Any chance that I can catch a viewing of it too?   Linds , I think I'm going to kill you for saying that I'm going to drive myself from that guy. Erg but you're right and that is what sucks MAJORLY! I'm going to try NOT to do that this time. Did I tell you that he's awesome, kind, open, genuine, sweet, christian? OMG i sound like a gushing girl. I think it's time to shutup.  Josh, don't die of shock.
