So I guess I'll tell you what I'm about. I'm # 6 of 7 kids... Me and my little brother are the only two without kids. My mom is deaf and my dad is disabled (sorta) he has one leg.... he's also a Vietnam Veteran. My mom was his second wife and they got divorced when I was 8... he got remarried right before my 14th birthday and even though we've had our fights, she's an awesome stepmom. I really dont have many good relationships to look at so it's safe to say that I havent had a really really good relationship. I try to be the best girlfriend I can be but it doesnt work. I try to be the best friend I can be and I can honestly say I only have two best friends in the whole wide world. Tencia and Rich- Giunta, not any other Rich I know. IF you're angry that you're not on that short list, I'll tell you why you're not. A lot of people just dont get me, or they depend on me to be there and they take me for granted. A lot of people smile in my face and I relly think they hate me... I'm still nice because I love everybody and I have this thing called unconditional love... It's a blessing and a curse. I love people so much that no matter how bad they treat me, I still care and I still do things for them and I dont like to see them suffer. I have so much compassion for others. Once I love somebody, that's it. I get taken advantage of a lot, and people make me cry a lot. My pet peeves? I hate it when I make or try to make plans with someone and they either dont follow through or they blow me off. I have an excellent sense of intuition... I know when a relationship with someone (whatever it may be) changes... if you think I dont know that you dont really want to be my friend anymore- you are dead wrong. I always know... that's the purpose in me being so open and so friendly... so that I know when you're not and I know when you start to feel differently about me. I hate people that lie or cant manage to tell me the WHOLE truth too. If you need to tell me something, just spit it out... dont act "funny" and yes, somebody was and I would bust them out, but I dont want to hurt anybody's feelings. I will tell you the most insane thing that's ever happened to me tho. I'm a chatter, true and true. I have been on this man bashing streak for almost a year and with reason. I had this friend, Jim. He was a decent guy or so I thought. He's old enough to be my dad, but I have quite a few older friends so I didnt think of him romantically. Well, he needed someone to "clean his house" was what he said, but he meant something else apparently 'cause the 2nd time I'd ever been to his house we were having drinks and watchin a movie and we were hugged up together on the couch. I dont consider that flirting 'cause I lay on the couch with my guy friends a lot- that doesnt mean I wanna sleep with em. Anyway, all of a sudden, BAM! he's got his tongue down my throat and he's almost on top of me! I was so shocked, I just kinda went with the flow and things progressed way out of control. The sad part? He took me home and never spoke to me again- like I did something to him. Normally I wouldnt even go this route and talk about something like this because I dont like to bust people out like that 'cause I care about them even if they dont care about me- but this is a perfect example of WHY I dont like guys right now. I could write for days about my one friend Jay... he seems to think he's the good Lord's gift to women and that I should be greatful that he even wants to sleep with me most days... *shakes her head* I dont know who's been lying to him, but he needs to find better friends. He makes a whole other pet peeve just by himself: concietedness is NOT a virtue and I wish he would learn that. We could be good friends if he would. I hate to break his little heart, but he isn't as great as he thinks he is. I love him... and that's what fucks up our whole friendship. I cant let him go and he is set in his ways. I've come to the conclusion though that I just dont have the patience to try to take care of a grown man the way I would do a kid, so I probably will not find the one. So, if I never get married, I'm going to finish school, get a good teaching job or get into educational policy, and adopt 3 or 4 kids. :D if I get married, I cant have kids so it'll pretty much be the same ordeal. I'm gonna go for now. Laters folks.
