AAaaaaaaaaaaa- why do people automatically assume that I am some strong person who can stand up to my problems and stare them right in the face? My way of solving the problem is running away from it, and licking my wounds in the dark away from all else. Calling Heather is never going to help me, it's just not the way I choose to deal with my problems. Heather has not called my house, so why call her? In fact, when she had the chance to come spend time with me, she blew me off and did not call me back. On my behalf, what part of that is inviting for me to call her and try to extend our friendship another month? And what part of that is inviting for me to make an effort not to end our friendship on a sour note?  She is ignoring me. She could just as easily be calling me. But no, she doesn't want to have anything to do with me because I am "upset." Upset! After how many years of calling you a best friend, you run away because I am upset?  Frankly, I hope she moves out of her Clay street house further away from me. I hope she goes to college and never calls me back. It just hurts too much to continue anything with her... I can't even think about the situation, yet alone call her and try to mend it. It's just not going to happen anytime soon, if ever. She's my past.   Mom says I can have a bonfire the weekend of my birthday, and I am actually pondering it. I really don't want this to verge on a party, I just want people to come over and hang out. I don't like the added stress that people are not going to have fun though. So that is the only thing that might actually stop me. Possibly.
