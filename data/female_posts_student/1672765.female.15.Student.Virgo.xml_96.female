I'll probably do the 4th and 5th this weekend or the end of this week if I don't get much homework this week (hah.) The only reason I got to do it today was I had already done my homework during school. I'm glad I got some done.   I can't believe it's Tuesday evening. For a moment I felt like it should be further on in the week but then I felt like it was Monday. So I guess it's where it should be? I don't know.   I don't know what I'm going to be doing this weekend, I think it's something but I don't know what yet...I have to sort it out...I kind of want to do nothing at all since I had such a long tiring week last week but then had a just as packed weekend so I really do need to get a nice relaxing weekend in. I don't know.  I thought we had an essay in English due at the end of the week but I found out it was only the rough draft...it was on Much Ado About Nothing and I think mine turned out pretty well. I'm kind of proud of it. I'll have to see what my teacher thinks of it...
