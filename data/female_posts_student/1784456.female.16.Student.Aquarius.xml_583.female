I should get it for my dad, you should get it for your's too! Who knows... maybe it'll put them off golf! Not likely, they're ultra weird dad's (like the rest of them) and oh-so slightly obsessed with golf. See! Obsessed! I told you! (shut up katie) :( I can't believe it, my own head telling me to shut up. Hmm.. that sounds wierd and confusing, maybe I should shut up... Eugh, I was having a hard time in SATs trying to remember how to spell maybe! Guess the stress got to me... that is right, isn't it? M-a-y-b-e not d-e-f-i-n-a-t-l-y-n-o-t yup, stress I tell you stressss! Mmm, wasn't I saying about eating more cheese ages ago? Well... it's time to eat more ...wait a sec while 'inspiration' hits... ... ... OW! tomato puree! Yeay! (I'm sure it's got a dash on the e somewhere!) Hey I'm going all french! Yeay! Happy hyper! Woohoo! I better go now before I scare myself! Bubi!
