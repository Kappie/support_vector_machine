We went back to school Tuesday and I had fun presenting my Geography project to the class.  Imagine last year I was completely stagefright.  In second period we had a review game in Wellness, it was girls against guys.  There were seven girls left and one guy left and coach Waggoner asked the girls a question and they got it wrong and Kevin got it wrong now if the next girl go it right Kevin was out and the the girls got three extra points on their test.  But if she got it wrong Kevin was still in.  Now someone asked whose next and I timidly raised my hand.  And you hear guys say oh god she knows it.  And girls say yes.  I was like you don't know if I know it.  Then Coach Waggoner says now be quiet she knows it.  And then I answered and he said correct.  And because of me all the girls in our class got three points added to their test.  Later that afternoon we had practice and a meeting.  Now for the National Qualifying Events Competition our team was allotted two Public Forum Teams that did not count against our total allotment of entries.  Ms. Then comes into practice and said I want Lindsay and Sara on a team and on the other team I want Michael and Caitlin.  I'm thinking oh shit.  What the fuck am I going to do.  It will be really fun, but two whole days of Michael.  Nonstop Michael.  OH MY GOD!  But then I figured we'd make a good team.  I'm prepared he's not.  He has tons of knowledge.  I don't.  We're going to kick butt.  Whoo!   Ta Ta For Now
