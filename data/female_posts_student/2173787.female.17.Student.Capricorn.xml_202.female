I need a holiday, a very long holiday, and I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to." -Bilbo Baggins  Why is it that blogs are neglected when life is good and overly typed in when life isn't so good?  Is my blog my rainy weather friend?  Only when I'm stressed do I feel a strong urge to blog.  Hmm...
