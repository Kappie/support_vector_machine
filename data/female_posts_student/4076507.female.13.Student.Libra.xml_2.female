So do i tell you what i did today? okay.... mmmmm Hannah came round and we watched some disney videos with Sophie (my little sister). We were planing on going to the cinema but changed our minds !  So i had to walk and meet hannah half way and it rained a bit which was fun! because that meant i was walking in the rain! heehee  So whenever i reched half way i saw hannah across the road and then this silver car pulled up beside her and it was my mum! so we didnt have to walk all the way back to my house which was pretty cool! So we went up to put snow white on and then decided to watch it with her ! Then we watched Sleeping Beauty which is the best disney film ever ! But hannah had to go home near the end ! She left me at the scary bit ! But her mum was collecting her on her way home from work so she had to go!! :-(( Yea so once hannah went nothing exciting hapenend! So thats the end of my day!  tara folks and thanks 4 watching !
