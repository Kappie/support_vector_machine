(you may think, hedish, you just DID do that, but i'm telling you i'm not :). )  anyways, i had way too much fun to regret any moment of it. I WAS THE SOCIAL PLANNER DAMN IT!  you all know it.  :)   gosh i'm tired. and i think there should be a LAW AND ORDER CHANNEL. 24 hours a day of law and order. it could be done.... what is this, the 13th season? and there's not just regular law and order..... we've got ci (criminal intent), and svu (special victims unit)..... years worth of entertainment. it beats that csi bullshit.  i'm thinking about investing in a new computer.... i'm not going to tell you which kind, becuase you will all make fun of me (minus other people in my field)..... but yeah i think i need it :)  you know what i havn't done in a long time? A PRANK PHONE CALL.   here's a little story for ya ags  it's sophomore year... fall 2000...probably a monday night... naturally, i'm drunk out of my goard. (sp?). It's been a fun night of partying, but I'm still awake, i'm still having fun... so i decide to do what i do best. and that is... the prank phone call.  it's an art really. i do it about as well as i paint.  :)  anyways, so i decide to start calling people... keep in mind A provides us with caller ID in the dorms... that's how stupid i am.  so anyways, i decide to call a nice young man in FHK... his name is lyle.   so i call him, and i'm sure i'm acting a fool... doing my best to keep from laughing (and you all know how that goes)... and i keep calling.... and i call again... laughing, laughing.... oh my gosh he's just freaking out.  WHO IS THIS? WHO IS THIS?  you know i think it's great because everyone else in the world knows its me before i finish the first scentence... this poor kid even resorts to calling ME, trying to figure out who it is... he even thinks if he keeps me on the phone long enough, just talking, i'll finally crack...   by 3am, he's on his bike heading over to UPD to turn me in...   i find this out because his roomate, g-spot (mike), was over visiting with my best friend's roomate and my friend, jessica.... lyle tells him he's going to upd cause of some prank caller, mike tells kristin and jessica... they tell me cuase i'ts funny, and of course my drunk ass is laughing CAUSE IT'S ME. I'M THE CRAZY PRANK CALLER.  the best part is my roomate videotapes it all cause she thinks its hysterical..... so now there's some drunk video of my stupid ass making prank calls...  and just to let you know, i confessed to lyle later and we made amends. :) thanks and gig em.   so i talked to my car today...
