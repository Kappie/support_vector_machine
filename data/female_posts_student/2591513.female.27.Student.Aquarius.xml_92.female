I do feel bad that Leila is pretty sick mostly because she doesn't have health insurance.  That really bites for her.  Healthwise my family isn't doing so well.  My sister continues to have lessions.  They are thinking of doing surgery on her.  Then my mom has new lessions in her brain and I am not happy about that one.  I don't know what that entails, but they have decided to give her a new medication.  I hope that things go well and that she gets better.  I hope that the stress of the past year hasn't taken its toll on her, although I am pretty sure it is just that.  That is maybe why I harbor ill feelings towards my cousin.  He knew my mom was sicka nd subjected her to all this.  It could have been avoided.  Thank goodness we are working with a great person.  Okay, well I have some stuff I need to clean up on my desk.  Have a great day everyone.  Maybe I will post later.  Oh and by the way, CURIE...THANKS SO MUCH for your undying support.  You are truly a friend I would hate to ever lose.  HEIDI...hang in there honey, if I can manage it, I will come and see you in Virginia.  MICA...the flowers were awesome.  I am blessed to be surrounded by some very wonderful people.
