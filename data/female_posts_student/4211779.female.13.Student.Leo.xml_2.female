I'm bored.Procastinating. :D Bored!I shall complain.      Today's topic: The Bitch.She's actually the housemate.Been here since July.And she's such a BITCH! She curry favours all the people in the house.Except me.I will never fall for her trap.And she opened my drawer once.And took my book and looked at it.Crazy bitch.And she keeps on asking people to 'teach' her to do her homework.Why?Cos' she's DUMB!She just sits there and shakes her leg.Oh yea,before she even 'do' her homework,she looks into the mirror for like,999 minutes?She thinks she's so pretty,yea,pretty ugly.      Okay enough procastinating.      "I don't know anything about music. In my line you don't have to." - Elvis Presley (1935-1977)
