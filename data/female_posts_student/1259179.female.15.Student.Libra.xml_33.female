If I could post a picture of them, I would.  I have no idea how to post pictures on Blogger... Do You...  We took the kids to see   Spy Kids 3, 3D  ,  so cool.  Kids wore those 3D glasses home.  Yea, I did too...  And boy, did we look smart.  Anyhow, life goes on here and summer is almost at the end.  School starts in 27 days.  I have made my list of school supplies and ready to look for those bargains.  As for me, I cannot wait until the New Year to get my hernias fixed.  I would ideally like to have it done in September and be in tip top shape for the Christmas Time.  There is no way I will go thru the same Christmas has last year.  I guess I will see what the surgeon as to say about that.  On this really breeze night, I say sweet dreams and.............Be Good
