I don't know what else to call it.  My chest hurts when I swallow, take deep breaths in, and when I turn over in bed.  I don't know what it could be, but it's lasted for five days now, so I figured that it's probably a good idea to get it checked out.  Unfortunately, the appointment isn't until next Tuesday.  Hopefully I'll be okay until then.
