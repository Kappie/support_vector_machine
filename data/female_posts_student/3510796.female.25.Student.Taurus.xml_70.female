Not till I see something new and exciting.  So dont count on it.  'Nuff said.  Friday night Superfly and I went to the Mishawaka Fest and she rode this ride that sent you upside down and all around. I watched.  I love rides, but not fair rides.  Not since I saw one crash and this chick got taken away on a stretcher.  No.  No more fair rides for ME.  Then we went to check out this band.  Meet up with some other friends and had a few beers.  Hit a few more bars and ended up at the IHOP.  Last time I looked at the clock before I wondered into this great thing called SLEEP, it was 4:39am.  So yeah.  Pretty tired the next day when Sokie woke up at 7:30.  YEAH, I slept 3 hours.  Onto my grandmas so I could drop the kids off with my mom.  WOW, I think I should take a moment and say THANK YOU MOM!  Id hate to have to leave these two at home alone. HA HA. Anyway, after I left my grandmas, I drove 20 minutes south to the Walgreens to make a copy of a picture taken on St. Patricks Day.  The machine was broke, so I had to drive 15 minutes north to another drug store to get this damn pic copied.  Finally. Bill ended up being $17.oo!!  What the?!?  I only bought the pic, a frame and a camera.  So I'm broke.  Again!  Oh yeah, then I drove a half hour south to my cousins.  I had originally planned to take a nap after I got there and helped her get things ready for the party, but it didnt happen.  People started showing up, food ended up on the grill and drinks were being drunk.  Beer that is.  Miller light even.  Corona!  Good times.  People were showing up left and right.  By the way, chicken on the grill is excellent.  Had some awesome chats with this guy who went to see Phish in Indy on Wednesday and he said it rocked.  Well duh!  So then I put my DMB sweatshirt on, and they all laughed.  :(  Kidding laughs though.  I guess when you get a group of people together, everyone thinks the same thing.  KINGS!  Sleep wasnt much of a thought for me last night either.     I said goodbye to my cousin, and yes, some tears were shed.  Cant help it.  Her and superfly are like my sisters.  I'll be ok.  Days will go by fast and soon, SOON, I myself will be on a plane to go see her. She'll be home for Christmas and that'll be all good.     Yeah, enough of that story.  Tomorrow will be another fun day with 'the visit' and then I have to meet my sister in law to buy birthday decorations for So and Mo's party on the 4th.  Something is messed up with the computer, and this sentence hasnt ended.  I mean, in this email, the page just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Ah, Im crazy, easy.  Crazy and Easy?  No comment.     I sat and watched the Cubs lose to the White Sox, shitty.  Piss on the white sox.  But the college world series was good, poor Texas.  Cute guys.  Cute guys in Texas also.    Text is working now.  Got them at 4:05 this morning.  :-)    Peace.Love.DMB.
