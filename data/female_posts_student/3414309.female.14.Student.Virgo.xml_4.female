HOTT! so we all walk back to nats and she locks them out and me and bri too so we start walking back when nat calls and says bernie is home and like me and bri freak out and have to like run as fast as we can back to her house .... lol and leave the guys. which sucked. hopefully they're not mad. so todays sunday. sundays are boring. real boring. i already went to church and did nursery duty. and now im home. and my mom just yelled at me cuz im supposed to be doing my homework . UGH i have that HUGE constitution test real soon and i DO NOT wanna take it and im so NOT ready! but i better go. bbl kisses
