Platinumblonde will probably blog whilst I'm there - so you can go and check out her page and find out how fed up she is with me!!  Although she can't write anything too horrific because I can read it later (unless she deletes it then....) Anyway I'm not allowed to think/say such things or else James will deduct points from me.  Am really excited now, but can't quite believe that I'm going to be in Canada later today. REALLY hope I don't puke on the plane because I have a window seat and don't want to have to climb over everyone. am also a bit nervous...what if I get there a discover Melanie is a total wierdo?!!  And don't worry you ER fans because I have my gagged packed.  so anyway I better dash. Cheerio...tuddle pip.....be good love Karenxx    P.S I have a confession....I have an insiders guide to ER on my bookshelf! But it was from when I was like 16.
