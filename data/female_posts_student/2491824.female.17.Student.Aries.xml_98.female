Then Mom and I went shopping. ...We got so much stuff... We probably spent about $300...  .... Yay! :)  It doesn't feel like I should have to go to school tomorrow...  Oh! And no rehearsal tomorrow! :D Oh Oh! Tomorrow night, I'm staying at Joanna's because my mom is going to Charleston, and she doesn't think I can be alone for a whole night or whatever.... :\
