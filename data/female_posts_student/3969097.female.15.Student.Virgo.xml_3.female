They gathered all their servants for questioning. The cook, when asked what he had been doing while they were out, said that he was preparing the dinner. The gardener said that he was in the garden pruning the roses. The chauffeur had been in the car waiting for them while they had tea in a hotel. The maid was doing the laundry. The butler said that after setting the table for dinner, he went to sort the day’s post. The couple found from their alibis that one of the staff was not truthful. Who was it, and why?   [ Ans:   The butler is lying: there is no post on Sunday.  ]     Murder or Suicide?     A man was found shot dead in his study. He had a gun in his hand. There was a cassette recorder on his desk. When the police officer entered the study and pressed the play button on the cassette recorder, this is what they heard:     “I’ve got nothing. It’s no use! I may as well be dead!” Then come the sound of a gunshot.     Inspector John knew at once that it was murder and not suicide. How did he knew?       [  Ans:    The cassette had started at the beginning of the man's statement. Someone must have rewound the cassette tape.  ]
