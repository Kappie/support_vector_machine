I get to hang with T and A and S and N and lots and lots of other people from 1:30 to 8!! *many champagne bottles are whacked against a ship*   I don't even actually know what we'll be doing there. I'm sure it'll be fun (it's always fun with those people), but I don't know, exactly, what it'll be like. I've got a gothic-y shirt on though, just to make S happy (last time I was supposed to go, it was his birthday, and my wearing gothic clothing was supposed to be his present.. (??)). I also have a funky black belt on, that I haven't worn for a while. And rainbow socks, just to prove that, in fact, I am not a Satan-worshipping sadist. Actually my shirt isn't that evil-looking. It's just a black off-the-shoulder thing with big sleeves. Love it ^^;   I don't even know that much about anime! I just like the art, and I can draw it (sometimes). It's too bad Britnix can't go lol; she would totally appreciate it more than me. But she's in OTTAWA riding HORSES, the little fink, so too bad for her. I'll brag about it on Tuesday. Sucker... Hey, does Murdles like anime? I know P doesn't (A were making fun of him because we didn't invite him ^^;) Anyway, I can't wait!! Squee!   *g* I know at least 3 As now. It's a puzzle... which one do I mean? *jeopardy (whoa... sp.???) music plays annoyingly in the background* heh.   Oh, and T showed me this totally drool-worthy pic of You-Know-Who. I'd link to it, except then all those lurkers who read this thing would realize who Frodo actually is, and that'd be bad. But jeeeeez! Who knew he looked like that underneath a uniform?? *falls off chair* (NO, he's NOT nekkid, you sicko) (he just has a bathing suit on) (and sunglasses) eheheehehehe...   Dammit, I really need to buy a Blue Man CD. This fantastic Tool music is reminding me painfully of it. Grr. Ooh, who here likes Jet? I got my sister a Jet CD, soo... They're pretty good, but I think that hearing them over and over again would get slightly annoying. That guy's voice just isn't musical, man!! Where is the musicality! Also: music is more important than vocals. Just thought I'd let ya'll know. This is why I love Tool. 'Bout 2/3rds of each song is just music, no vocals at all. Love it. And the vocals are really muted, too, and the lyrics, and...   THIS is obsession. I would only murder T if she got to meet Tool. I wouldn't murder T if she went out with Frodo. So T, a hint: don't go seducing my band, okee? They're mineminemineminemineminemineMINE.   ...       MINE    , got it???? ^^;;; lol.
