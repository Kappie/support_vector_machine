My legs ached like hell, so occasionally I would sit down to do them. I have ant bites EVERYWHERE! I thought I had it pretty bad. I went psycho because the ants were biting me, and I had one on the inside of my thigh, kinda high up there (not really high, just pretty). Well, one, I thought? Try SIX! There are six bites, and they are huge, pink bumps and they itch and sting. I HATE ANTS! People act like they are so great because they work together and act like the community everyone wishes we were. Screw that! The bastards bite and they have no mind of their own! So what if they can tunnel and lift like 6 times their own weight? I'll admit it, I can't do that. I CAN step on them though. Show me an ant that can do THAT! I'm better than them. I hate ants.
