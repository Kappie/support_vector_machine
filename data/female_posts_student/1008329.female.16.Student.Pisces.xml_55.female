I can get a massage  without a hard-on.  I can balance the checkbook  I can pump my own gas.  Can talk to my friends  about the size of my ass. My beauty's a masterpiece  and yes, it takes long.  At least I can admit  to others when I'm wrong. I don't drive in circles at any cost.  And I don't have a problem  admitting I'm lost.  I never forget  an important date.  You just gotta deal with it  I'm usually late.  I don't watch movies  with lots of gore.  Don't need instant replay  to remember the score.  I won't lose my hair I don't get jock itch.  And just cause I'm assertive  Don't call me a bitch.  Don't say to your friends  Oh yeah, I can get her  In your dreams, my dear  I can do better!  Flowers are okay  But jewelry's best.  Look at me you idiot Not at my chest.  I don't have a problem  With Expressing my feelings.  I know when you're lying  You look at the ceiling.  DON'T call me a GIRL   a BABE or a CHICK .  I am a WOMAN.  Get it, you DICK?    huMm..now I think that's for those little girls that are mad at little boys.
