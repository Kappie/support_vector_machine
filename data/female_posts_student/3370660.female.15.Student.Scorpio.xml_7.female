Paige and JT have decided to stay together, despite what Paige's mother wishes. Pure astonishment and amazement fills me; their commitment to each other is riveting.  Toleration for most other couples are rapidly diminishing. Why is it that every other romantic bond I witness is faker than Pam Anderson's boobs?  At the beginning of the year I told three friends of mine some crucial advice; Don't look for love, and it will find you. And now it has, for all of them. Bethany is now dating Toby, Nora has Justin, and Hannah just got David.  Emily(the house "squatter") paid me a visit today, and she told me stories of her experiences in this field. She'd already had three serious relationships(one even lasted two years). Only a year older than me, yet lived so much more.  I suppose I should follow my own advice, but last time I did was a train wreck. Thats when I found out Patrick liked me, and thats when I lost his friendship.  As I see it now- I can continue to pursue Vineet, and have the gaurantee that no oportunities will come along.  On another note: I've been off Wellbutron for a month now. The difference, at least for me, is quite noticeable. Dad went of Zoloft a week ago, and the difference is apparent to all of us. I can't remember the last time I saw him this depressed.
