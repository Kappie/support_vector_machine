I have screwed up my sleeping system to no end.  GRRRR.  Yet, I am not doing anything to amend it.  Case, Michelle, and I just went to Wal Mart at 12am.  Yeah, I spent $53.  I hope that lasts me for at least two weeks.  I LOVE TO EAT!  Oooo...  I got raspberry yogurt newtons.  Come on.  Anyhow, I just tried on my Catholic school girl outfit.  ;)  I might wear that for Halloween.  Or, I'm going totally Goth.  Or flapper.  Why can't we have Halloween like 4 times a year???  I just wanna dress up.  And eat candy til I get sick.  :P  ...OR, I could go as a drag queen.  Case could help me. :P  He's going drag anyway.  Dang, I'm tired.  Hey, has anyone else discovered the wonder of Google Image search?!  I spent about an hour today with Benjamin Bratt, Tom Welling, Justin Theroux, and Mark Ruffalo.  Mama miiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaa.  Has anyone read "Death Constant beyond Love"?   That was an amazing story.  Modernism is one weird/intriguing movement. Zzzzzzzzzzzz.
