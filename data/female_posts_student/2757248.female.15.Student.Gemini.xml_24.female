WE SAW A RABBIT IN THE BACK YARD!  got dressed DADDY BROUGHT ME TO SCHOOL TODAY..  AM HOMEROOM- talked to ppl 1-3: Science Lab- worksheets.. my teacher got an attitude w/me.. i put her in her place tho.  4-6: Spanish- Read in our workbooks 7-9: PE- badmitton and talked to ppl 10-12: History- movie 13-14: lunch ...wasnt really hungry so i went outsided and did my homework.. alone. *TEARS*. and i missed ..him @ lunch so i was sad 15-17: English- quiz 18-20: algebra- bookwork   got home.. did homework. KIRBIE CALLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAYAYAYAYAY! we talked for EVER! and i LOVED IT!!!!!!!! god i miss her SOOOOOOOO DAMN MUCH. then did algebra and NICK CALLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EEEEEEEk!!!!!!!! we didnt talk forever but i still loved it!!! I MISS HIM TO MUCH!!!  then algebra.. no one called this time and thats the only reason i finished it.   now... im here... and heres what ON MY MIND..  i learned its easier not to care. but just because i  SAY  i dont care doesnt  MEAN  i dont care and you of all people should know that what i say isnt always what im feeeling. not that i've told you that i dont care, not that ive had the CHANCE to. i dont think about it as much.. it being us. but wondering how you are and what you're doing is ALWAYS in the back of my thoughts even when you're the farthest from the front of my thoughts as can be. I always told you that you didnt know how much i loved you. Now when i think about when i used to say that, i know i didnt realize THEN how much i REALLY DID LOVE YOU and how much i still do. I dont want to need you anymore because i cant. I dont wanna try anymore im so tired of it. The sad thing being i dont even know what im trying to do, or fix, or want. I guess i should just avoid the situtation of seeing i have an oppourtunity to talk to you and i've been doing a good job of it lately but it hurts and i havent cried or thought about you in  DAYS but i dont know why today is different. It just felt so right and thats what i cant let go of. I was wrong when i said that since we werent together i still didnt want us to say bye. We have to walk out or it'll never heal. bye... i love you
