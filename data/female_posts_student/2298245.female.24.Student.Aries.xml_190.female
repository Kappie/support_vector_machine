I've realized I'm over a month into the semester and things are going so fast, and of course I'm behind, so I'm constantly playing catch up, only the fact that I'm behind drags me down, so I get even more behind...you get the picture.    This week I've been working on this very big, very important paper that I'm supposed to be writing.  Only I have no idea what I want to say, much less what I can say.  Writing a legal paper is not so easy.  It's not like college, where I could just say whatever I wanted with nothing to back it up.  Most of this paper is going to be footnotes, which means most of it will be stuff that other people have said that I have to use to support what I want to say, to support my argument.  This is not an easy task.  So today I'm trying to get a grip on it.  Only it isn't happening as well as I'd like.  I know if I work hard it will come together, as it always does, but that doesn't stop me from having the same huge self-doubt that I always have when something like this is looming on the horizon.  I always think I can't cut it, and no matter how many times I'm proven wrong, it still comes back.  So I'm chanting in my head to remind myself that I'm not a miserable failure, which is actually helping - only all the chanting makes it a bit hard to concentrate.  But this is not the only craziness going on in my life.  If this were all I could handle it with no problem at all.  But despite this, there are so many good things, so I shall choose to focus on them.  Not to the point of ignoring the bad stuff, though, because I've done that before and nothing good comes of that.  Oh, well.  I guess I should get back to work now.  Already, I feel better just from having vented.  It's hard not to have someone you can really vent to, or worse still to have people to vent to but to be to concerned about bothering them or bringing them down with your trifling problems.  So I vent to this page, and if people happen to read it, then that's cool.    No worries folks.  I'm not teetering on the edge of sanity.  I'm just stressed.  But it's law school, it's what I signed up for, and I'm very happy with it most of the time.  It just gets to be a bit much on occasion, which is when I feel the need to post here.   And now that I have done so...and feel tremendously better, I should get back to work, so I can figure out what the heck I'm going to say in this paper.  I have an outline due next week, complete with sources, so I figure now's a great time to get it together.  Onward and upward, as they say.
