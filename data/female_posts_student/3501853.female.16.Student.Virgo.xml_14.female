My mom and I went to the new outlet mall in Aurora..I took like an hour nap going there, I hurt my neck. I actually had a good day with my mom. We were talking about funny stuff I told her then we talked about our matching bracelet and why she gave it to me...being her only daughter, she just wants a connection with me and I guess she feels jealous when I pick other people over her or gets worried when I'm not around her and she gets jealous of my friends and that's why she's mean to me and I told her that ya in a lot of wayas I love my friends more [I didn't show it tho] but that doesn't mean I don't love her more than anything and altough I don't want to be like her anymore or have any of her flaws, it doesn't mean I don't love her as my mother.."just because a person doesn't see eye to eye with another, does not mean they should not walk hand to hand"...and I also explained to her my whole situations and how I've been feeling lately and when she says stuff I get hurt so I think now she's going to accept my feelings and know I'm hurting, she's even letting me keep sleeping with the sweater so ya it was a good [almost maybe great] day with my mom..I feel a lot closer to the bracelet now. She bought me Adidas rubber shoes today for working out and aerobics next year cuz isn't it sad? I don't own one pair of rubber shoes so I always have to borrow my mom's but i finally got one today. It's white and purple and pretty. She also bought me my new bathingsuit. I was going to get it at Pacsun but it was 100 dollars and really wasn't that cute so I went to this one store called Ziemel or somthing like that and it's just like Pacsun but more skaterish but anyways they had lots of bathingsuits so I got mine thhere and I like it a lot except it looks like I have honkers of love handles so I need to lose weight for it plus it was half the price of the pacsun one. I like it a lot I just need to go to the gym before june 26th. So ya my mom bought all that for me so basically all I really bought was Tim's father days presents. I got him 2 shirts from Eddie Bauer. The mall closed at 6 so we were forced to leave so we met up with Tim at the house and he drove us to BKK [by photo's] so we could eat Thai food. Yummy. Man, I just remembered I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday this week. I need to go work out. Now I'm home watching the Lakers game, we really really really need to win this game. I laid down on the couch and started watching it and a tear fell..I was remembering a time when he was here and would just sit there and listen to me whinea bout the Lakers...it's sad, my heart hasn't even considered letting go..I know it was my fault this all crashed but I would do anything in my power to try again but it's up to fate's hands and if fate would let me I would show him how I felt no hold bars but ya...Same thing with the other 2 people I hurt, okay tears again so I'm just going to stop now..and half time is almost over so I gotta go watch the rest...here's some good lyrics: "I miss my friend, the one who brought light into my life" -darryl worley  "Sometimes life ain't best if left in the memory. It's better kept inside than left for good"-nickelback  "Good morning day Sorry I'm not there But all my favorite friends Vanished... in the air [my fault, my fault]but it's hard to fly when you can't even run. Once I had the world, but now I've got no one"-3 days grace  "God damn everything, I remember being happy"-moneen  "The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself. For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath. She finally drank her pain away a little at a time but she never could get drunk enough to get them off her mind".-brad paisley  alison kraus
