It was directed by Nick Cassavetes and the story originated from Nicholas Sparks's famour novel, which is also the title of the movie, The Notebook. It is about a man who's in his 80s told a story from his notebook to a woman who is in his same age too. The story that the man told the woman actually bringing back the life of a young couple. His name is Noah and her name is Allie. This movie basically belongs to those literary-romance type. The movie touched my hearts. Currently, I'm also searching for novels written by Nicholas Sparks. His articles are so fanstastic and heart-rending too. Well... As for heart-rending, I think some of his novels are. For those who really know how to appreciate those literary-romance type movies, I greatly recommand The Notebook.  A small quotation that i've found over the net.  Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited...It is never rude or selfish It does not take offense, and it is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.  ~ 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
