Sure we dont have a jacuzzi tub, but we have my porch glider and stuff like that.  I dunno, I just missed it.    On the trip we went to Provincetown, the gayest area I've ever been to in my life.  It makes Greenwich Village seem like it's homophobic!  We went there once before but we didn't really see much of it since we only went for a whale watch.  Needless to say, it was faaaabulous!  (Ronnie-kins, I got you something!! hehehe)  Except for the restaurant we had lunch in, Cafe Blase, which was very blase about its service.  Bla-ecch is more like it.  I actually had to signal someone over after sitting for 20 MINUTES waiting for someone to wait on us.  I mean, that's just wrong.  Totally.  We were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half and all we had were 2 drinks and appetizers.  What the fuck? was all I could say.  The place we stayed in,  urlLink The Barnaby Inn , was taken over by new owners.  It was kinda surreal, actually, since we'd been there like, 3 times before that.  However, that said, the new owners, Laurie-Ann and Michael and their 4 girls were very hospitable and are making subtle little changes to make it more their own.  The previous owners got divorced and it seems that the place had been on the market for over a year.  The husband was doing everything on his own and I assume it was hard on him... poor guy, he's really great.  Anyway, so now he's rented the apartment above the garage and still helps out around the place while he builds a new home not too far away.  I guess the only thing that was 'annoying' was the fact that this new couple have children, albeit the youngest is around 12.  Also, they literally JUST moved in so they were up very late fixing up the place and such.  I love kids, and like I said, everyone was VERY nice, but when I want to get away, the last thing I want to worry about is the fact that someone may hear me getting busy!  (did I say that?!? oh yes I did!)    We DID have a good time overall and next time we go up there we told ourselves to go to Nantucket. [insert dirty limerick here]
