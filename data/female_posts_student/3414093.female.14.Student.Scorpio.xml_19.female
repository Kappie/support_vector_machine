So really there is way to much drunken details to explain and I  REALLY  want to get back to my book ( The Da Vinci Code ) so I'll skip those details.    I stayed home yesterday cause I was in serious need of sleep, and I went home right after first period today cause I'm sick...blaaahhh...but the up side is that I am like three quarters of the way done the book (that I started yesterday afternoon) and will DEFINITLY be finished by tomorrow sometime...I AM LOVING THIS BOOK!!! It is fantastic. Nothing can discribe how eather-real this is...and I'm not even sure how to properly use the word eather-real or how to spell it...but I like this book so much it just HAD to be said!!!  David is a cool kid. He thinks I'm hot and awesome...which is good...more people should think that. He said I rock teenage hormones...isn't that sweet?? hehe...he is a gnarly kid.  Anyways...do I have anything else to say?? Well the book I'm reading has jump started my work on the sequel to my book...so I intend to mosey on along in writing it as soon as I'm finished reading  The Da Vinci Code .   Umm... My new philosophy (as read in a pull out of a Teen Titans comic book) is   If you intend to die, you can do anything   I love that...it is so utterly true...and I live by it...in my own twisted way...woot! woot!
