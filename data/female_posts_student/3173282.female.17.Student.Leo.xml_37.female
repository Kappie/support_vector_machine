Today was a really really good day. Got up at 7, took the test, passed, Kate came over, i got the car for the afternoon, me Kate and Karin went swimming at Kate's grandma's pool, came home, visited Chad and his kittens!, stopped by zack's n played mario kart hahaha, came home! What a fantastic day. I'm tired now. Gotta get up at 3:30 am to leave for New Orleans, then Texas. I'll be back monday so all you kids give me  call. I got my Dawson's Creek cd in the mail today and i loves it. Hmmm well i have absolutely nothing else to say except good night and looooove you! xoxo Meg
