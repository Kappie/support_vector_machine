Its one of those "the dummys guide" thigns... well, actually, the real title is,  The Complete Idiot's Guide To Understanding Ethics . well, i think most people would be on my side if i were to say im no idiot when it comes to morals, but... i was flipping through it and it had some simple explanations of many theories...which is cool. so i was reading it this morning...i read about psychological egoists and actually wasnt very convinced with their argument against them, but then again i just cant find it in me to believe (like, really  believe) in psychological egoism anyway, so what does it matter? Its one of those things i wonder about sometimes.       Psychological egoism is, for anyone whos wondering, the theory that humans always act out of self-interested motives and can't help but do so. "In all cases, where people do things both good and bad, they are only doing things that they really want to do....doing good acts makes us feel really good about ourselves; our brains release pheromones, we feel a sense of self-worth, and it makes us happy" (Ingram  Parks, 67). And for even mor explanation... "Physchological egoists claim that (1) we only do things because we really want to, so we shouldn't be praised for good acts and (2) we want the good feelinging that come with doing good things, so doing good acts is really self-serving" (Ingram  Parks 67). So its kinda like that. The theory that, no matter what you do, no matter how selfless and "right" it is... no matter how little you benefit from a certain act tangibly... youre still only really doing it because its going to make you feel good. like consoling a friend on the phone until 1 in the morning on a school night when shes just feeling awful and like life sucks and that nothing will ever get better.... why are you doing that? why waste your time when you need to be sleeping and doing homework and... its just stupid. well, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, right? well... psychological egoism says sure, youre doing it because you want to help your friend, but you want to help your friend because it makes you feel good inside when you help people. so really youre only doing it for that warm, fuzzy feeling. you know what im talking about?      Yeah, so my book talked about that and refuted it unsuccessfully in my opinion, but... the only thing that really stuck out as a good point against it was that "The assertation that, 'Everything we do is done because we want to,' would be true by definition: To do something is to do something we choose to do; and to choose to do something is to want to do it. So, 'Everything that is done is done because we want to do it,' would mean nothing more than the empty claim that, 'everything that is done is done because it is done'" (Ingram  Parks, 68). So, duh, we only do everything because itll make us feel good...because we want to.  Making a choice in favor of something is always means you want to do it, and if you want to do it, it means it has to be making you feel good about somethign in some way. you know? So maybe the whole theory isnt saying very much at all... being ethical is about making the best choices regarding those fuzzy feelings, i guess. I dunno. it doesnt completely satisfy me... there are still "But!"s in my brain saying psychological egoism is true, and then there are the "oh, shut up"s from the moralists in my head saying "so what? doesnt take the dignity away from making good decisions." and stuff... so yeah...  and it talked about moral subjectivity and stuff... but im not gonna get into that.  anyway, what i really meant to write about on here, was about Jeremy Bentham's idea of Utilitarianism....the idea that morality has nothign to do with pleasing God or being commited to absolute rules; rather, morality comes down to nothing more than the attempt to create as much happiness in the world as possible. which...well im not endorsing that or condeming it, but this Bentham guy set up this system for judging how much good will come from your actions. You have to rate things on a scale of 1-10 in 7 categories and tally up the points. Categories: 1. Intensity: How intense is the pleasure? 2. Duration: How long does the pleasure last? 3. Certainty: How certain are you that the pleasure will occur? 4. Proximity: How soon will the pleasure be experienced? 5. Fecundity: How many more pleasures will happen because of this one? 6. Purity: How free from pain is the pleasure? 7. Extent: How many of us will experience the pleasure?  (whoa...just got totally sidetracked for like an hour looking up slam poetry and trying to figure out of there are places/clubs in tucson that have weekly open mike nights or whatever... hey, its a college town. there are crazies. and where there are crazies, there are poets. how cool would it be to go to a poetry slam thing with the friend im gonna get to take over the summer? way cool indeed.)  So let me justify, using Bentham's method, what always seems to leave people shaking their heads...   SLEEP  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: mmm, sleeping's not incredibly intense, but the feeling of tiredness and will to sleep are sometimes, so ill give it a 5 2. Duration: Depends on how long I sleep, but say im gonna get 7 hours.... you know what? im still gonna be tired in the morning cause ill have to get up for school... though it will keep me from dying in class the next day... so im gonna go with 3 3. Certainty: How certain am i that im gonna get a nice, deep sleep? depends if i have something on my mind, but seeing as how i cant fully relax most school nights because therere always tests to worry about...lets go with 6 4. Proximity: the pleasure in sleeping is pretty much the moment you lay down and that period as youre falling asleep...when you know you can just sleep. so its pretty instantly gratifying, i guess. so...8 5. Frecundity: well i'll be fairly well rested for the next day, and thats good, so...maybe...6 6. Purity: I could have nightmares or bad dreams... if i have good dreams its very good... but not always...i tend to dream about things im worrying about... so... maybe... 6 7. Extent: aside from the fact that not as many people will hear me complain about how tired i am, my sleeping helps no one...so 1.  Total: 1+6+6+8++6+3+5= 35   STAYING UP LATER THAN I SHOULD TALKING TO EMILY ONLINE  (on a school night)  1. Intensity: :-) well, i do greatly enjoy my emily conversation...but in person or on the phone is better...so... 7.5 2. Duration: It will keep me happy until the next time i get to talk to her, because we know that the longer the gaps between fulfilling conversations, the crazier i get, so 7. 3. Certainty: mmm...this isnt that high because sometimes she isnt so willing to talk to me...what with homework and stuff...so 5. 4. Proximity: well its good to talk to her when i talk to her, so...um...9? 5. Frecundity: this is kind of a weird question...but... the more we talk, the more we know about each other and the better friends we are...so...8? 6. Purity: this might be lower too cause maybe wed have a serious conversation that wasnt necessarily free from all unfun thoughts...and...sometimes i realize things id rather not realize...so maybe...4...although not always...but...oh, i dunno, i should score this lower on something, shouldnt i? what the hell, ill just stick with 4. 7. Extent: well me and her get to have fun. and people get to be spared from hearing me complain as much about not talking to her... so... but still thats not very many people, so 3.  Total: 7.5+7+5+9+8+4+3= 43.5  35   Ha. Mathematically proven. sort of. But there. im not crazy. its just...true...for me. Id rather talk to emily than sleep. Now dont ever tell me you dont understand why i make that decision time after time.  and we also have an explanation for why i never used to get any sleep at sleepovers. and that was when her score would have been higher. cause 2, 5, 6, and 7 all would have been a little higher, methinks.  Crazy philosophy book. i wonder if it talks about love... perhaps i should look it up...  oh, you know what else i decided? when i take my friend to arizona were actually gonna do cool stuff. like possibly see some spoken word poetry preformances, visit carchner caverns, kit peak observatory... mmm... see a movie? i dunno, thats about all ive got so far... oh, go on a night hike in the desert with the ranger peoples. and go swimming and build forts in the guest house and capture lizards and... um... if she be emily, do some of the looking at the stars, feet in the pool truth or dare stuff...followed by a movie. of course. lovely routine, that.  mmm...vacation... i look forward to taking my friend. mmm, friend. frined(s) i should say. considering my parents never definitely said no about taking more than one. although...hmm... the issue of who is a rather large one this time. i dunno. it can wait at least until after spring break though.   i think i might go drive up to blockbuster and rent something. maybe. im scared of the roads again though. damned lane changes. i hate lange changing. im gonna get killed.  i really wanted to talk to emily too.... perhaps i should call... mmm, after my movie though. if mis padres permiten.  adios para ahora.
