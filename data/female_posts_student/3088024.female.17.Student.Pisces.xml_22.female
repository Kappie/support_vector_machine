Noone has a life so they talk about everyone else.  I am getting sick of "Christian" school.  In math class, if you want to say "This isn't going to help me in real life.", go ahead, you are probably wrong, but go ahead.  In Bible class, however, I just do not understand how my "Christian" peers can talk and not pay any attention.  ITS THE BIBLE!!!  It important for our spiritual growth!!!  We are learning how to intelligently defend our faith!  ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO ANYONE???  *takes deep breath*  I need to better obey the rules.  I have made a genuine effort in dress code and I need to read the handbook and try the other stuff.  Lead by example...and then never come back.
