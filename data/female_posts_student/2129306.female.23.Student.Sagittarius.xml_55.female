I have nothing more to say about it, except that I hope Mr. Beantown gets a million dates thanks to the show.    Drama, Drama, Drama   Soooo sick of it.  And it amazes me...just as I start thinking that things CAN'T get more shocking, then they go ahead and do.  Ugh.  And I have just been informed of the absolutely pig-headed activities of someone I used to consider (to say the least) a very dear friend.  Like I said earlier, people have a way of surprising you sometimes.  But I refuse to worry about it.   Dan Bolin   Sorry if I cut you off on the phone.  After I hung up I realized I was kind of rude.  I guess I just don't want to rehash all the drama.  Sorry.  Come visit Springfield again soon, and we'll do lunch or something.   Grant-writing   I have to spend 8 hours of precious time learning how to do this tomorrow-I have no idea what I'm getting myself into, since I have been dealing primarily with the state legislative stuff, as opposed to obtaining federal funding (which is what I assume this is for).  It should be interesting.  There's still so much I don't know, but I'm learning as quickly as possibly.   Political Science   Just give me my degree already! (16 hours away after this semester...) I'm reading the most horribly boring book-EVER-at the moment.   Affective Intelligence and Political Judgement  by George Marcus.  It's about as exciting as the title makes it out to be. BLAAAAAAAHHHH...I hate 90% of the reading I've had so far this semester...it is so terribly dry and soulless, it bores me to tears. That's what I get for taking stuff besides constitutional law...darn requirements.  that's all I've got for now.  Adios amigos/amigas.
