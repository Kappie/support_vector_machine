I wish my parents would have named me Cedar. Isn't that the coolest name ever? It just makes me sound tall and confident. Strong.  But alas, I was named Laura!! Haha. not that Laura is a bad name...  I told my dad that  I wanted to change my name to Cedar and he was like "Uh..it's a cool name..i guess."  Then we went to safeway and I picked out a sherbert [that's a cool name toooo!] and then Jacob was like "lets get sorbet instead." So I was like "Ok." SO we picked out a tasty lemon sorbet. But then right before we paid for it he was like "You know what..I want peach instead" so he got peach without even consulting me!! Little did he know I hate peach so no sorbet for me.  Oh well. I am quite content with my cookie dough.   DOUUUGHHHHHHH  Dou-ugh!  hahahaha  [inside joke. mwa haha]
