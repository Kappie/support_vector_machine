My grandparents are getting this special "long time service" award from the First Church of God and my grandpa insisted my mum and dad go. But my mom didn't want to so somehow she got out of it. I WANNA got to indiana for a day!!!! My grandpa is paying for it all and everything.  Did I tell you he wrote a book? It is like 400 pages long and he just got them back from the printer place. I should take a picture of it. I am expected to read it. Yuck!!!!!  I hate reading books when I am forced.  You know what it is called.."My Life Story"  I mean if you are going to write 400 pages about your life it might as well be called like "My Journey Through Time" or something.  :)
