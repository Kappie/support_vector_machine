I did do some cutting out of aprons though, but apart from that zilcho. I'm gonna have to do homework tomorrow though. Ooh, I'm gonna go watch Bend it Like Beckam *how  do  you spell that?* Hehe, bet I'm one of the few dozen who can't spell it! Yeay! Any way, expect a review of it (or a very tired me moaning about some thing) later. Bi then!
