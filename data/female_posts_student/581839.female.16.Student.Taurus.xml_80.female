Every morning they ask to play LIFE or MONOPOLY. So yeah. We saw about a boy and it was really good, i thought that it was an adorable movie. Hugh Grants hair looked especially adorable. So my mom is in the kitchen making cookies, mary is who knows where, margaret is spacing off, and jordan and zack are asking my mom if they can do things. Hopefully today we will be able to see goldmember. Is it good? Anyone? anyone? I'd better go, i'm using up money, and that isn't nice at a guests house. bye Jules
