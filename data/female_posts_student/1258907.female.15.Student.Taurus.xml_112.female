Having seen your struggles last time You know you cant make it through again Even if the change is good, you know you cant go back And all you want to do is go where youve been A familiar place with familiar faces A place of warmth in the cold world A bit of light in all this darkness You cant again Not when things are just starting to make sense Not if it means you have to make another choice No way could you risk making the wrong one! For that constant fear of change in you is eating you away We all need a familiar place with familiar faces And because of that, we cant more on For that constant fear of change inside Is eating you away And you have nothing left to spare.
