The razor blade is sharp Cutting in my wrist  The skin peels apart  Pink flesh is underneath  The cuts are getting deeper As the anger builds inside me Annoyance makes it worse Driving me to cut more  I don’t wanna deal with this anymore.  I wish it would all stop The pain is all that helps But I continue to  hurt inside  The urge is much to great I’ll fall back in  I want to feel that blade As it rides over my skin
