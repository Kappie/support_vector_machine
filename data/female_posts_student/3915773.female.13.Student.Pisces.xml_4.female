The main idea of the video chain store is to make it less rental orientated and more appealing to people that want to buy, sell, rent or trade video games and movies. Also, Blockbuster will be opening an online rental program that claims it will rent DVD’s for $19.95 a month compared to $21.95. However even this might not save them from the threat of video on demand. This article has a list of the top ten rented movies from Netflix and Blockbuster comparatively. The lists were quite different.   When Netflix was first introduced about the same time DVD’s were making an appearance of their own, my family stopped renting at Blockbuster. For our fast paced life it seemed more convenient to pick up the movie in our mailbox and return it whenever we felt like it; I think this is a major advantage of Netflix. Even though Blockbuster claims they can provide the same service for cheaper I don’t buy it. When Netflix first started it was also $19.95, but after about a year or two they claimed they had to up the cost due to shipping cost. I do believe the only thing helping the DVD by mail system is that movie studios release movies on DVD before pay-per-view. Also, the fact that in rural towns cable isn’t always available. Personally, I don’t know why the top 10 rented movies list would be so different. Do you have any ideas? Will Blockbuster be able to make a come back? Are smaller video rental companies on their way to being bought out?
