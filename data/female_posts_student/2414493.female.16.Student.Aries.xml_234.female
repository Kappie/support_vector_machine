An 800 isn't going to last you very long. Education's the only sanctuary, which is horribly sad. I get eight weeks of freedom because it's Harvard Summer School. RHP was similarly motivated.  If I detached myself from this unit and transplanted myself to a similar but more tolerant one, I think my life would be perfect.  My only consolation: I'm going away soon. Damn it all.
