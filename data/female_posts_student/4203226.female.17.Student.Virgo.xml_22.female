WE always knew that there were bunk beds in the room, but it never occurred to us how the floor plan would look like. Then Olivia came up with this really good - space economical way of dealing with the whole 2 people in the room-bunk bed thing. Have loft beds with the desks underneath. Pretty neat, right? Yeah well it would be  if that were the case!  But it isn't. The following is a picture of what our room is going to look like. Excuse me while I develop claustrophobia.
