Nothing exciting has been going on really to report - just spending time with a few friends. I STILL don't have my car, that will hopefully be ready by the middle of next week. Just hope its not being used by a bunch of shop students somewhere as an experiment. You know, where they take the car entirely apart and then put back together to see if they did it right. But I think that is what my mechanics have done to it anyway, so maybe students would do a better job and get my a/c working again. Out here in the hot  humid cornfields of Illinois, you really do need air. And out of self-protection in my hometown, going over the bridge so you don't pass out from trying to hold your breath too long.      Today is the Relay 4 Life out at the community college. I'll probably be out there for the fireworks, walk, and talk to a few people. I try to go to that every year, but I missed both of them last year (one here and one at school). I usually have a luminary out for my cousin who passed away of cancer back when I was in high school; maybe they will still let me put one out. They do have an absolutely perfect night for it for once. (This day has been gorgeous, 73 degrees and sunny, with a slight breeze.) As soon as that is over then it's over to the hospital to pick my mother up from work. At least she lets me use the car, I just play taxi. But its a fair trade. Well hopefully I orthe "Boston dweller"will be millionaires by the end of the night. I won $35 gambling earlier this week, so maybe I'll be lucky and my streakmight justcontinue!
