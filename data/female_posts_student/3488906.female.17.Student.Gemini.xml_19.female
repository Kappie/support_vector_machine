Does this resembles that i've got no more hope in life? Dreams actually means something.. isnt it? Just chatted with Tin Cheng. He's actually a nice person with a kind heart. He loves giving advice and i bet he gives advice to anyone who needs it. Argh. I promised him to get 9A1.. but let's forget about the A1.. as long as it's A.. i'm satisfied. Tomorrow ownwards, i'll strive hard for my target.  My one and only Target..and that's SPM. Like Siew Chien has always said, try your best. I know, and i'll try. Seriously, this time.
