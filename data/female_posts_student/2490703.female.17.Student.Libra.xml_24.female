I haven't started working at that particular store because it isn't open yet, but I'm sure it'll be loads of fun! Travis, Janell, and Nathan are here from Wisconson. I've missed them so much. Nathan is getting so big. He'll be 1 in August. It's hard to believe a whole year has flown by. It doesn't seem right that I'm not going back to FHS...which in no way is a bad thing. College, here I come. Anyway, I hate the day care job and I wish it would just end. Hayley and I decided that we're going to Warped Tour 2004! YEAH! I'm super excited. Maybe Ryan will be able to come now that he knows the right date! That smart Andy, he told him that it was the 8th. That kid needs to lay off the pot. Anyway. I have to go, I have to go feed the baby! OMG! TORE IS HOME! I missed him. But yeah, I'm out.  Peace and Love, Melissa
