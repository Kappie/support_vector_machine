I wasn't even feeling well enough to work on my house designs (designing houses has become a passion, secondary to x-ray).  I watched the news, Who Wants to Be a Millionare, 8 Simple Rules to Dating My Teenage Daughter, Frazier, and According to Jim.  Good stuff.  Well, I'm trekking off to bed.  Gotta get up early and try to feel better for a fun filled day of Fluoro.
