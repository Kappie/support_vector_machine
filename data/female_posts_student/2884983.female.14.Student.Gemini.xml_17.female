He knocked my  lamp over the ledge  above my head and it missed me by this much!! *holds up fingers about and inch away* I  fed him too . oh that reminds me...I have a target on my hand and she threatened to stab me with a fork, just like in that movie....*babble babble bitch bitch rebel rebel party party*...ner ner  ihave NOTHINg interesting to say...OH!! soccer started.
