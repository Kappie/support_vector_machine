I NEED TO GO SEE KING ARTHUR!  we left the day it came out and that's so horrible because i need to see keira knightley.  i'm actually going to see this movie alone if i have to.  other than that, i'm left with a whole lot of nothing to do.  if anybody wants to do anything, call me!  i promise i'll be free.  god i'm so pathetic.  i miss taylor.  *sigh*
