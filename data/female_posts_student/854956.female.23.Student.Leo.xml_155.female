Brent and Frank and I were hanging out in the foyer of the music building today before we went into Dr. Balentine's music theory class... what fun we had!  Then Brent and I went upstairs to find out where they moved the computer lab because I was going to have my microcomputer applications in music class there.  We found it w/o much trouble and then goofed off for about 10 minutes making our way back downstairs.  Then Brent wanted to talk to Sally, and so I shoved off because Sally isn't too fond of me b/c Jered (her recent ex) and I became friends last semester... and she doesn't like that at all.  So, good news about classes... I have several people from my Sign Language class in two of my classes on MWF... :-D  I was happy to see them... they're so much fun, even though they're much older than me.  One (Sandy) has a son who's married and also has a granddaughter... the other (Bridget) has 2 children in middle school and one is about to go to Roosevelt next year!  He's the one I gave a bit of a lesson to to prepare him for district band tryouts last October.  He made 2nd chair... I must've given him some good pointers, and she is forever grateful for my help.  :-)  Then there's Naomi, who is 20 and engaged... she's so nice and I'm glad that I made friends with her because she's so very nice.  Okay, other good news... my microcomputer appl. in music class that I went to for the first time today had a bit of a problem.  You see, over the break, they were supposed to be getting all new computers for our music computer lab... and we were going to have 30 computers... this is why the lab location moved.  Alrighty, so, they didn't get the new computers, and we still have the old ones, and there are only 15.  So, bumping the cap for the class up to 30 wasn't such a good idea, because now we have 29 people in a class where there are only 15 computers.  *sigh*  So, the conclusion that Dr. Sebald came to was to give us one lab day a week.  Half of us will attend class on Tuesday, and the other half on Thursday.  I picked Tuesday, because I like to get stuff out of the way at the begining of the week.  :-)  And also because, now I only have one class this Thursday and it gives me time to run my car over to Saturn to be serviced.  ; )  Well, that's about it for my update thus far... oh... well, Greg Wright had to quit A.S.K.  :-(  He had a school schedule conflict.  A class he was going to take in the morning ended up only getting 4 people in it... so they cancelled it and told them they need to take the afternoon class... which runs from 2-3:15... which really keeps him from making it to work.  Good news for him is that he's probably going to be able to get a subbing position for Tues/Thur/Fri with A.S.K.  Our sites are always in need of extra people to sub.  Especially ours right now... which is why Scuba Steve has been at our site.  He's good people!  :-)  He's very funny, and I'm really glad that he and I have the oldest kids together this week.  Although, yesterday it was me and Greg Padilla... and that was lotsa fun, too... we like to joke with the kids a lot...  Okay... that's all for now... Enjoy!
