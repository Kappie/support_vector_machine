Yes, and just so that you know, I died last night, but I came back, because I actually didn't die, and so yeah. Well, I more or less finished my chemistry, but I have no clue how to predict the boiling points for misc. solutions. Anyone care to explain???? (It's for Lab 44, Amaris. Ugh. I never actually  did  the lab, but I understand it. Ah well. THat's life I petition that we change Your mother is an aardvark. Next person to post, DO SO. :-) Gentle reminder. :-) ANYWAYS... You all make me sad, with the exception of Nathan, because none of you can follow directions!!! (And Sarah, because she already told me that day at lunch.) WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIES???? ALison, Jane, Olivia, Nathan, Sarah, and Jonah need not answer for they already have. That leaves...YouNa! And so, YouNa, what is your favorite Disney movie??? (And of course anyone else who is reading this and would like to help further my US history cause. Let's call it Manifest Destiny- Revisited, but not quite, which yes, I am aware that it makes no sense at all. Deal.) Ah, and the answer to Sarah's question: None. I hate all Lucky Charms. I hate all cereal. With a passion. I hate it! (Even more than Algebra!!) When I was little twice I found worm-thingies in it, and now I won't eat it at all. yuk!!  I am going to the choir concert tonight. THat was kinda random but not really. Anyways, yeah.  And Sarah, yes, I do need those service hours. I'm going to count the Silly Sarfari place as my action service hours, and woodwind ensemble as my creativity service hours. And so I still need service service hours, if that makes sense, and to most of you, if not all of you that doesn't. Quick recap- IB sucks. Not only does it restrict your schedule, but you also must perform 150 service hours divded equally among Creativity, Action, and Service, abb. as CAS. I have to get thirty hours this summer, next fall, next spring, next summer, and the fall after that. Woohoo. And so yeah. Could you give me the dates of VBS?? That would be a help especially when trying to figure out when I can volunteer this summer at the other place.  Well, that's all for now. Your mother is an aardvark!!
