I'm not sure if I have a purpose, if I have several purposes, or if I'm just sitting here wasting my time. Where the hell am I? What am I  supposed  to be doing? Is there anything I really  can  do, anyway? You can't recognize that you are lost if you don't know where you should be.   Yeah, I'm posting a bunch of entries all at once. It's kind of weird. For awhile I had no idea what to write. Guess that changed. Anyway, I haven't actually written about the events of my day, so if anyone cares or is as hopelessly bored as I usually am, read about it in  urlLink VW's blog .  Ha. I love how I write in this as if I have a big group of random internet strangers who have stumbled upon my blog since I made it just a few days ago and now loyally check up on me every day. Yeah, right. I know that VW reads this, and Kate probably does. And then there's that Siri character, who only comes here because VW and I very randomly left an extremely long comment in her blog. Oh well. I don't know what I expect from this.   Maybe I should just comment on strangers' blogs more often...
