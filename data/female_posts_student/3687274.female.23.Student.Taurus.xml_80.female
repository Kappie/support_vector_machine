I haven't had the aching desire to run away....yet.  I hate the stupid boy now.  Bastard.  I was talking to Tammy the other day-- if I ever say that I was talking to someone and then just go on an out of this world rant...it's safe to assume that the someone I talked to was Tammy-- and we thought it would be funny if I went in angry and yelled at him for not calling me, when I was sitting by the phone expecting his call.   ***Not really what happened!!!  I was expecting, but not sitting by the phone!  It's routine.  He calls me and compliments me and I say the dumbest things possible and giggle...a lot.  That how it goes, man.  But he fucked up the rotation!  Anyway, we thought that would ensure that he wouldn't ask me out.  That way...here comes the logic...I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.  It will just be over and done with.
