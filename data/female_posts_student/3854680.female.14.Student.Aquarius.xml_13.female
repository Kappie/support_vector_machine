Seriously, she has all of her little friends ganging up on me now, because she can't stick up for herself. Read this, you'll understand (auto response is my away message, for all of you non-IMmers):  FezRus7211: your a bitch! ur an ugly fuckin duish! This is ashley and mary and kaihla! we hate u so bad. the only ass u can get is a gurl, cough cough. ur such as fuckin ugly loser. omg u r just so damn sick to look at ur face.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto response from xOxInnocenTxOx27: Oh, Lord, am I tired..  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FezRus7211: ur face looks like my ass FezRus7211: only my ass is hotter then you ever wish to be FezRus7211: if only the world could see how ugly kari really is FezRus7211: sigh FezRus7211: she has no friends and a shim bf FezRus7211: o wait you are a man so i guess it all works out FezRus7211: stop saying bad shit about ashley shes prettyer then ull ever be u hoe FezRus7211: i talked to dylan and he doesnt even know who you are and we showed him your pic and he said what the hell happened to her? FezRus7211: got nothing to say now bitch?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto response from xOxInnocenTxOx27: Oh, Lord, am I tired..  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FezRus7211: tired from what sleeping with your girlfriend  My response to her: xOxInnocenTxOx27: I don't sleep with people, I'm not a slut like Ashley. I was at work all day, because I do things other than complaining and being an immature little girl. My mommy doesn't have to tie my shoelaces anymore. No, Dylan didn't say that he didn't know me, because he does. I don't know if he said that I was ugly or not, and to tell you the truth, I could give less of a shit. And I never said I wanted to be prettier than Ashley, so get over it. xOxInnocenTxOx27: Don't you have anything better to do with your time? xOxInnocenTxOx27: Get a life.   I'm trying to be mature about this whole thing (it may not seem like it, but there's SO many things i want to say about her, to her, and DO to her, just to torture her at little bit right now..). Compared to what I want to do, that's mature enough for me. In all honesty, I'm about to kick some blonde little butt. "Shim bf"? Why does she have to bring him into this? He didn't do ANYTHING to her, and he wasn't even involved in our argument. She doesn't have enough crap on me to get me angry, so she has to bash those that I care about.  I'm ready to bash her head in.  I don't care if she talks about me, but talking about my friends (and on top of it all, my BOYFRIEND)?! Whatever. Seriously, people, do something better with your time. Spinning in circles is more productive. Lord.
