Went jetskiing last week and I’m going again tonight… it’s such a blast and I’m super excited!  We might be going camping this weekend, so I’m sure that’ll be fun, assuming the snake/spider factors are kept to a minimum.  haha  Vivian’s party was Saturday and that was fun (Happy Birthday, Viv!), then after hanging around at Kid Country for awhile, Charles, Habibi, Mooney, and I came to my house and played Taboo.  Such a fun game!  Well,  not when you’re tired…  We carhopped at Sonic on Sunday- a lot of fun, in my opinion!  I think I’m gonna try to get a job at one of them as soon as I… well, stop being lazy.  heh  Amy’s party was Monday (Happy Birthday to you, too, Ames!), so we swam there for a little while, then went to Chipotle, and then Charles and I went to go see 28 Days Later.  Pretty good movie- I kept seeing infected people running around in the dark when it was over.  lol  Lindsay came home from Germany yesterday- really excited about that.  It’s nice having her back home and she’s always got some interesting stories to tell.  Yesterday, I just hung out with her here at home, and then she went to bed after dinner (all tired from the jet lag stuff), so I met up with Charles at soccer.  Then we picked up Collin and hung out in Target playing with their super cool toys.  Today, we’re gonna go to some hotel and swim in their pool/hot tub and use their sauna.  Then, Charles, Mooney, and I are heading off with Kevin to go jetskiing!  Woohoo!  Hopefully, we’ll go to the Ft. Worth zoo one of these days… I’ve got some Sprite cans for buy one ticket, get one free, so we could all go for half off (which is pretty cheap).  Let’s see… what else… oh yeah- gonna have a picnic one of these days, too.  I guess that’s all for now- if you’ve got any good ideas for some cheap summer fun, let me know!  Cool song alert!  Coldplay – “Whisper”  That’s all for now.  See you guys later!
