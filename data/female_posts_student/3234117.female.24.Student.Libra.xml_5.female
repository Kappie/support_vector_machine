Libra  (MY horoscope) Your planets turn fickle this month.  Pluto can't decide if you should live happily ever after or die alone.  This thought might keep you up at night.  You will be troubled by that whole "bird in the hand" thing and wonder if you should have stuck it out, but you did the right thing.  Your ex was not The One.  Or was he? End-of-the-month news of his engagement might set you back a bit.  Gemini  Take some risks this month.  Although not risks like you took last month.  You should  always  use a condom.  But you know, some small risks, like asking out that guy you always see at the gym.  He will turn out to be gay, but at least you put yourself out there.  The Twenty-first is a good time to make changes, like switching to a different gym, or city.  Aquarius  The planets are shifting in your favor, and you're in the power seat...for about a day.  The Twenty-first.  So don't sleep through it.  The rest of the month you have no control over your love life whatsoever.  You will fall for a string of men who just want to be friends, lose ten pounds, gain twelve, and contemplate lesbianism.  Hang on though.  By the end of the month, a relationship you have questions about will become even less clear.  Pisces  This month is going to be a roller coaster, Pisces, so keep your hands in the car! You will meet an exciting new man on the Third, but find out he has a girlfriend.  Another sexy stranger will come into your life on the Tenth (not as sexy as the first guy, but this one is at least available) and you will share an incredible night of passion, then he won't ever call you again. Sorry.  Taurus  Get ready! Your job is about to get much more demanding, especially near the full moon of the Twenty-first, which is good, because it will take your mind off the Breakup. Be aware that your superiors are under a lot of pressure, so they might be less tolerant of sobbing during work hours.  Likewise, the phone sessions with your therapist might no longer be considered a valid reason to miss a meeting.  Venus in Scorpio means all eyes are on you- so this is a good time to stop stealing office supplies.  (Yes, kleenex boxes are considered office supplies.)
