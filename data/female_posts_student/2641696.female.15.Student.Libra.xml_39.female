Stupid Mr M let us work on it in class, and so I finished it there, and now I've got nothing to do! So A and I are practically instant messaging (is that even a word..) each other through gMail (it rocks, BTW -- soo fast and coolio-looking), and I'm reading m0Do's  urlLink Eternal Journal , the coolioest thing since sliced bread. I'll make a separate article on that later. Maybe later today, since I am dyyying of boooredom...   Frodo makes me sad. He's always alone, but he's a great guy. Why doesn't he want friends?
