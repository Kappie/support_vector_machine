Some people are short and skinny and have stupid hair and big stupid emo glasses and think that they can treat some poor girl however they please, then act all buddy-buddy with her after she tried so hard to phase him out. SHIT. I'm so done with everyone who treats me that way. It's probably my fault if I'm all too ready to put my guard down. See there it is again- it isn't my fucking fault! Have a nice life. I'm DONE.  GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjEiK:WJgeHIJMqfjNSVm.  Otherwise I had a good day.  Newspaper was out today... everyone liked my article on Freddie Mercury. I should probably try to think of something else to write about other than music. But for right now I was satisfied with it. We had a pizza-party today in Journalism and now I'm all full of happy pizza-goodness. And now I'm going to paint my nails blue and rock out to some White Stripes. I might even eat a Go-Gurt, even though I'm not on the Go. Hell, I plan to dance around my room in my underwear. Boredom does strange things to a girl like me. But I'm sad cause I'm sitting here on a Friday with no plans. Actually the only plans I have all weekend is to work on my video project with Colin Burton and Lauren Miekel on Sunday (don't ask me how I got myself into a group with the most annoying people in the milky way). But it's cool. I'll survive. They're nice people. See, some people are annoying and they are not nice people. Funny how life throws you shit like that.
