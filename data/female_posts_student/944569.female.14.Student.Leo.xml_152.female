Unfortunately, I had to delete the tagboard so perhaps you could all use the comments columns (an entry form for the comments list is available above each of my blog entries, just click the blue font that says Comments) to post up your messages until I get a new tag board.  I can't seem to remember the address for the other one i had.  O_o I'm sorry if I haven't been updating in a while.  Homework and studying are slowly taking me into their grip 24/7 now so forgive me if i dont post enough.  Ja!
