But, as it happens, I failed dismally and she knew within the first half hour of being home. Fuck. Oh well, at least she didn't find out until she'd given me the new coat she bought me in Queensland! (Sucker!)   Oh crap, speaking of the woman, she just came out here and said "What happened in my room?" With the meanest ugliest face you've ever seen in your entire life.  And i'm thinking, 'shit, she saw the wax all over the bathroom...' but no, she reminds me that her lamp is broken, and she's found a glass with a crack in it.  Oh yes, I failed completely dismally... i've got no idea about the glass, but the lamp - it got broken when Al took a flying leap over the bed and smacked her hand through the shade! Crap. I'm so screwed. Byebye nice new coat! *sigh* I would've thought she could at least be nice to me for the first night she got back...  Hum... yes well, anyway, with the return of my mother also comes the crappy return of school. The last thing in the world that I want or need right now... i'm already stressing about it, I just don't need this shit in my life right now! Seriously, if this wasn't my final year, and there weren't only a few months to go... I just wouldn't go back. I hate it.  I loathe it. I despise it with a passion. Dear God, just give me a break and get me out of this hell!!!
