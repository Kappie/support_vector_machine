Yesterday was a really bad day and quite frankly this morning wasn't much better.  After I got the phone call saying that we weren't going to Gatlinburg, Mom suggested that we go to the mall, which I was kind of hesitant about because we always stay there forever and I had a lot of homework and studying to do, but she said it would do me good to get out of the house, so we went to the mall.  Ok, so that was fun and all, but we didn't get back home until 8:30.  Now I have about 4 hours to completely learn a chapter in math (thank God for Becca) and do all the homework for a month in there, study for a Psych test, an AP US History Quiz, and a Spanish quiz, and do Spanish and Anatomy homework, none of which I knew anything about.  Realizing this, I promptly have a panic attack and make myself rather sick.  After I calm down a bit, I call Becca and she stays here until past midnight helping me with my math stuff.  Then I stayed up until around 3 to try and finish my math homework, but I'm quite unsuccessful.  Mom finally comes and makes me go to bed, and then wakes me up this morning at 6:00 or so and I was like "Can I take a mental health day?" which I've never done before, and she was quite set against the idea, but she said to call my daddy, which was a mistake on her part, because I'm Daddy's favorite.  After a couple of tears and me explaining the situation with a few "Daddy, I love you"s thrown in there for good measure, Daddy takes my side and argued with mom for me.  Needless to say, he won, since I wasn't there today.  So mom goes to take Whitney to school and after about 30 minutes she isn't home and I'm kind of getting worried when the phone rings.  It's mom.  She's got a flat tire and I have to go pick her up.  All the way home, I'm going about 5 under the speed limit and she's like "Lindsey, watch your speed.  Lindsey, I'm going to take the car keys away from you.  Lindsey, I thought you were going to bottom out on that speed bump" (I was going about 7 mph) which wasn't annoying at all.  So we get home, and mom starts her Bible study for the day and gets sick.  So I have to take care of her.  Still haven't gotten much done.  I sit down and eat a little bit and get to work.  After about 3 hours, I'm finally done with math.  Another 2 hours and I'm done with everything else.  So I come up for lunch and see mom crying and asked her what was wrong.  Apparently a close friend of the family's(Christy Stickney, the one with leukemia, who I've asked yall to pray for quite a bit) cancer has spread to her brain and the doctors are giving her about two weeks to live.  Then mom left for Ruthanne's house with commands for me to clean up the entire house even though Lori came two days ago.  *sigh*  Not a good day.  I don't think it's done much for my mental health.
