"this is bad neighbourhood now...='( now i can't leave my bike out!!" hmmm, reason ithink she wanted to steal my bike was because her's didn't have a seat on it..lol. i noticed that much. plus, i knew who she was ..she goes to pickering, and she was in my business class in grade 10...you know chris? the one who asked for a pencil near the end of the school year out of nowhere when we were at our locker? yeah, THAT girl.
