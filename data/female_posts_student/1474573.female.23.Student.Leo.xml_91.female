Now let me tell you, when you buy a phone you will eventually break it or lose it especially if you use it alot, this is especially true if it's at all expensive. It makes sense to pay the xtra 3 bucks a month  (at least for a year) and then just get a new fone in case yours breaks down. Well ok, i admit it maybe i  DID abuse my fone a litte.....so it was scratched but that didn't mean it had to completley die on me! the v60 i's are SOOOO OO Fragile! anyway.....i'm around y'all can call  diane
