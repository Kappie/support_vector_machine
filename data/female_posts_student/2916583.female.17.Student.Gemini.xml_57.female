The first one:   http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph1tOIBB6IBJZJXD.dir=/d83d.src=ph  and the second one:   http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph2uOIBBQR5ULnfB.dir=/1da2.src=ph  You'd better like those pics, Edwin, for all the aggravation.  Click on the slide show, cuz u can see them best.  Ok, now that I've ruined a perfectly good opening, I'll simply pretend THIS is the opening.  Please disregard this.  Amber: You're totally right.  We do need a class together. Nichole: Yeah, I definitely think senior year's the year [note: I've said this every year since sixth grade] Amber: and if we don't have a class together next year, we can go to college together! Nichole: Yeah!  We can sign up for all the same classes at Longwood [second note: I have no intention of going to Longwood...I'm all about goin to JMU] Amber: and if we're not together in college, we'll get jobs together! Nichole: Workin together 9-5.  It will sooo rock. Amber: and if we can't work together, well we'll just have to die together Nichole: That's a bit morbid, but sure we can be buried side by side  That's a recreation of one of the most odd conversations I've had this week.  Just for your reading pleasure.  Right now, I'm thinkin about NHS.  We had our speeches today for officer positions, and mine didn't go very well.  See, I was already trying to refrain from giggling all thru chem, cuz I had D12's My Band, especially the funniest part of the song - Slim mockign his female fans:   So I get off stage right and drop the mic Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like "Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady" I'm the lead singer in D12 baby They're all like "Oh my god it's him" "Becky oh my fuckin' god it's Eminem" "I swear to fuckin god dude you fuckin rock" "Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"  So I was already doin the thing where I'm tryin sooo hard not to laugh by making the apples of my cheeks protrude and smiling a little bit, when I look down at Mallory.  I don't remember why she was laughing, but she was.  I just lost it.  It took me forever to regain my composure.  Other than losing my place after that, I did semi-good.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure I didn't win.  If I wasn't running, I would have a rele hard time deciding between Sarah, Musty (Mustafa) and Megan, so I'm guessin they went for the ones that didn't crack up in the middle of their speeches.  It does kinda suck cuz i worked soo hard on that (too bad I didn't stick to it up there) and got so many ppl to edit it.   Ooh, ooh, good news!  MY BIRTHDAY'S IN TWO DAYS!!!!!!!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO BE SEVENTEEN!!!!!  I wanna go see a bunch of R rated movies, like Troy (see "what is sexy?" paragraph) and sum other flicks i can't think of rite now.  Of course, no matter how much Ashley says I'm an overgrown kid for liking kiddie movies, I still wanna go see Shrek 2.  Tripp says it's awesome (FYI: all ppl nicknamed Tripp are the third person in their family of that name...tripp is short for triple...didn't know that).  I love Shrek so much...the humor is on soo many levels, u always find a different joke every time u watch it that u never noticed b4.  Ooh, I'd better not start talkin about movies, or me n Alex will be goin on a THIRD movie date lol.  O dear Lord I gave them ideas. I was lookin over some earlier entries, and do u kno what?  Katy was absolutely rite.  1). I did talk a lot about food in the earlier entries (aw hell who am i kiddin i still do) and 2). I talk about Alex waaaaay too much in here.  I went and counted, and, out of about 60 entries, he's mentioned or hinted at...get ready for this... 30 freakin times .  Eleven times by name, the rest that I. or A. crap from my earlier entries, or innuendos.  I really am a bit of a smart ass sumtimes, straddling the line between that and a bitch a few times.  It's sad that even my best friends are only mentioned like seven times at the most, Shaheen ten (she'd be a friend, not a best friend).  Why does everyone say I'm so sweet and nice and kind and friendly if I'm such a bitch to him sometimes?  Very few times do I compliment him...I compliment other ppl a LOT (as Jason B. says, "I fish for compliments"...stupid bastard). Why does everything pertain to my life lately?  The quote I put as the title, "methinks the lady doth protest too much," means that if someone protests something excessively, it means they're lying.  And, I was looking up Ecclesiastes 3:3 for Monique (yearbook signing), and there was a verse, Ecclesiastes 3:8 that's almost scary: "A time for love, and a time for hate, a time for peace, and a time for war."  Speaking of yearbook signing, I got the last of the seniors to sign my yearbook today.  I do wish that Nick B., Ellen, Andrew R. and Will C. could have signed...other than Ellen, all the *interesting* ppl (haha thats code for loud mouths, but I really do like Nick and Andrew, even though Andrew used to be a total ass from like 6th to this year, and still is occasionally).  I really do love signing yearbooks, and reading what everyone has to say.  Yea, it's a bit fakey, but it's enjoyable.  For example, Jasmine, Stacy P., Zach and McKenzie all signed my yearbook in the same way (ur gr8! and sumthin else I can't remember rite now), and Katy, Emily, Mallory and Mary all signed mine, hinting at the lovely topics we discuss in journalism (journalism was fun today in 1st cuz we played rock paper scissors shoot and although I won over two, Will C. got to hit me...luckily he barely knicked me cuz he missed).  There's still sum ppl who I want to sign, but I'll see most of them tomorrow.   We were discussing what makes a person sexy in journalism today.  Of course, it's all about the ass and the boobs for guys, but it's a bit more difficult for the females.  It fluctuates from person to person.  My mom actually got a bit mad at me for having a brain fart and expressing my opinion towards a male celebrity...I said I was extremely surprised that George Michael is gay cuz he's the ultimate 80s sex god.  Actually, I think John Mayer's very sexy...he rocks my world, as the board goes.  I actually saw a guy who looked just like him at the car dealership, except that guy had blue eyes, not brown.  Blue eyes are hotter anyway (especially beautiful pool blue or clear blue or sky blue or icy blue or baby blue).  He was beautiful.  O man, u know what I found out today?  In Troy, BRAD PITT GETS NAKED!!!!!!  Wow, I definitely am gonna go see it now...me, dominique and a few guys (if Achilles is havin sex in the movie, then theres definitely a few girls naked too).  Just had to add that little tidbit in.  Back to "what is sexy" (Victoria's Secret).  Actually, that's about it...deep, expressive eyes are most important in the looks department.  It's sad; all my friends would say tall, good build, cute ass, beautiful eyes, shiny hair, but I'm more about personality...although I'm up for a guy with nice hair and a cute ass... ;) .    Well I got to go to work (I have to be there at 5:50), so I'll add more later.  If you come by Shoney's and I'm chuckling to myself, I'm probably thinking about the lines, "I swear to f'in god dude you f'in rock, Please Marshall please let me suck your [well you get the point]."  Later dudes (from the song lol).
