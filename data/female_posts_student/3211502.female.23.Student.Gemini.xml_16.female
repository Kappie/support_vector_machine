It's a fabulous movie, with a kickass soundtrack. I'm not going to give away any of the juicy plot lines, but I've never laughed so hard in my life. Sorry to be gross, but, honestly, there were a couple of times when I thought I was going to pee my pants.   This is what I miss about my pre- med school life. Before medical school, I used to have time to just hang out, watch movies, go to concerts and, quite frankly, do nothing. When I'm in the throes of classes, I have very little time, if any, to do this/that kind of stuff. This is my last summer vacation ever and I'm going to do my very best to enjoy it. Hopefully.
