I came home and found out that Robin and I are friends with the woman (Aka kevan).  It was quite a shock at first to find out that this has happened to my friend but I was okay with it.  I than checked my email and got an email from "The person who shall remain nameless" telling me that there was a rumour about us liking eachother.  I thanked him for letting me know and I returned to doing my homework and eating dinner.  After dinner and math, I took a shower and had a conversation on msn with Robin.  Just then, a window popped up saying that I had an email from "The person who shall remain nameless".  I read the letter and it turns out that he DOES like me.  *Shivers*.  I feel weirded now.  I don't know what to do, this person is older then me.  I do like him sorta but I don't know if my mother or anyone would approve of this.  God, I wish Vanessa was here so I could ask her for advice.  Why did this have to happen now? Why couldn't this have happened when Vanessa was still here?
