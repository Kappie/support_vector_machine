Today's Wednesday Best is Best Movie: Clerks "Whatever, I'm not the one in denial and supressing rage, mother fucker" "Shoe polish smelling mother fucker" "fucking cock smoking fucker" "You get me slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!"
