Nice kid I've talked to him but he's not the brightest star in the sky.  So listening to "dude...no way dude...DUUUDDDEE...that's crazy dude" is like getting run over by a car over and over and over and over.  I dont know how much more idiocy I can be inundated with.  I have to take the SAT soon and I feel all wisdom, knowledge, et cetera being drilled out of my head.  From what I hear from my brother and his friend-on-the-phone the mullet may be resurfacing as something attractive/cool.  *bangs head againt sharp object*   College is coming up soon.  I am praying for a cool, intelligent, friendly, mature Christian as a roomate.  I think I seriously may die if I listen to this conversation any longer.  DUDE!!!!  HAH HAH HAH  THATS CRAZY!!! WOAH!!!  SERIOUSLY NO WAY!!!  I feel like my ears are on crack...  I should write a book on this or film him for TV.  I bet people would buy.  Primetime or PPV  I dunno.  I wonder if there is a circus I could pay to kidnap him.  DUDE MY PARENTS SET UP THE COMP TO KICK ME OFF AT 9.  THATS SOOOO DUMB KID!  (DAD HOW COME DUSTIN DOESNT HAVE TO GET OFF?)  ummm  he is 17.  *hey what is this on my hand-oh my brain has actually started dripping out my ears*  so i was like...oh my word...dude...no way...seriously...dude...craziness...i know...wow kid...did you know in brazil they wear speedos...dude i know its crazy...well i wont contaminate you any more
