It has been, from what I've been told (since I've seen very little of it first-hand from my window overlooking the building next door while sick in bed) some of the best weather New York has seen in a while this past week.  And I missed out on it, being ill.  But today, I feel well enough to venture out, and it was cool and foggy and wet and rainy and...yes, even icky.  Made me wish I hadn't gotten out of bed at all.
