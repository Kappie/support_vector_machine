Today i found out that she thinks we've changed to much to be friends anymore.  I say yes we've changed...but not that much...she just needs to give us a chance.  I think it hurts more then anything to see that she doesn't care as much about us not being friends as I do. Its killing me right now. It's like she doesn't remember how much fun we used to have and...just everything. I don't know how to go about getting her back either. I feel like I'm trying to get back a boyfriend cause this is how I act in such a situation...only for some reason it seems alot harder to do this.  I just wish she'd come to me and try to be friends with me again...but i just don't think she wants to anymore...and everytime i ask if she wants to do something shes..busy. Depressed. I'm going to go finish off the chocolate cake in my kitchen and watch trading spaces and pout to myself.
