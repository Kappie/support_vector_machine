Things seem to be happened in a same way everyday, go to school from home, and then go back when the school dismissed. Then the next day will repeat the same things again, except the lessons we have in school are slightly different everyday.   However, there are some special things do cheer me up in last 2 days. I met one of my friend who I’ve lost “face-contact” for 1 year. We went for lunch together on Tuesday. During the one year, he does not seem has any changes. He’s still so shy.. (haha.. actually he’s not that shy lar) His friend who accompanied him stabbed his back in front of me. Since we met almost everyday online, we did not have any special topics. Hehe… It was really a good moment for me to meet with an “old” friend once in a while.  On Wednesday, I met with another friend of mine at the bus stop where I usually go. Both of us are in the Form 5 this year and we got the same examination pressure as the SPM trial examination is just around the corner. There’s only 31 days to go, exactly 1 month left. I was glad that he’s willing to take the same bus with me that day. Reason? He will be reach home 45 minutes later if he took the same bus as mine. Haha… Although it wasn’t any big sacrifice, I appreciated it.   Today, I realized how important the band was to me. I had a band practice just now. I miss the practice a lot since we were off for 2 weeks after the competition. I attended the practice; I was really enjoying myself just now. Even though many members were “missing”, we have had an enjoyable moment. We played the music without any pressure (which we experienced during the competition). The songs, which were played just now, fully filled with feelings. I found out that I love the band so much. I couldn’t imagine what would I be after I left the band. Hehe… =) Anyway, I’ll remember every moment which I have gone through in these few years. Now, I could firmly say, “I never regret I’m a band member”.
