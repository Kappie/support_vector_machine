He is actually talking to his brother about something right now that is pretty important so he can take all the time he needs with that.  I just hope he calls though.  Him and I need to finish talking about things.   Blah.... Life.. work, eat, sleep..well never really sleep, then work.  Fun stuff and good times right?
