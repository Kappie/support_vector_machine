I was really pissed that I didn't get to see *someone* but oh well....there's always some other time though!! :P...Im so pumped about the recent news....Its gonna be cool as hell, and Im down! I went out on the lake again today and it was fun....the tops of my legs are a little bit burnt but oh well.  I leave in 6 days!!!!! :( yall will be glad to get rid of me! lol...........NO, everything i've been working on is gonna fall apart, I can feel it.  Im gonna try to go out tonight and see some people before I leave but I dont know if its gonna happen!! Im gonna try though!!!!  I've been thinkin a lot about the past and how everything just seems to dissapear and noone really takes the time to find out why!  I lost the best thing that ever happened to me a couple of years ago and I'm still tryin to recover. I've been thinkin a lot about it lately and I can't come to a conclusion...what if I could go back and change something ya know? I mean there is so much shit that coulda been avoided but I guess thats how life works. I just wish I could go back but I can't. Some say that there is that special person out there for you and you should wait for them. I messed up and lost mine but....well yeah...I don't want another special person...I guess I'm done.
