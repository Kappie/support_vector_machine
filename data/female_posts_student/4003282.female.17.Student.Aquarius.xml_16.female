But not the drama and work. I didn't go to work today. I feel so bad.      I talked to Josh for about an hour. It was so nice. I  love  him so much. He's the bestest thing that happend to me in a while! Since ya'll know who. But I really do  love  him and I don't wanna lose it.  * Smile*       I need to eat something. Got band again today. At like 6. Arg. I hate Tuesdays and Thursday. They are such a drag. BORING. But other than that. I think that's it. Oh besides I am madly in love with Josh. So in love it hurts. Well not hurt but you guys know what I mean. He's  my baby  and I'm his!!   And he's the  only  one for me.    Well I gota go eat something.        L  a t e  r   D  a  y  z
