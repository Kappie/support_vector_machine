I had a few people at work stop and ask me about the picture and I gladly gave them the information I had. I love talking about Jesse and what he is doing. I am so proud of him and I hope he understands that. I mean it is not every day I can say I know a soldier in the ARMY that is serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and really mean it. I mean I have had distant family serve and friends of friends and so forth, but I can safely say that I KNOW this soldier, he is my husband and I am so proud of what he is doing for our country. I am proud of what the rest of the 319th are doing as well as the rest of the soldiers who are currently serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I have finally figured out a way to bring you some pictures that Jesse sent me. So I have included a few in this post. You can click on them to view a larger version of the photo.    urlLink       urlLink        urlLink        urlLink       I am glad I got a chance to share these photos with you and hope that in the future there will be more photos to share, "Jesse, love, keep them comming!"
