Anyway, the beetles that i will be studying originated from egypt hence the exotic-ness of them. They actually look really ugly. he sent me info on it and yep it's really ugly. it's not colourful or anything - just black :( anyway if this blog could show pics i'll stick on here but if u guys really wanna kno what they look like go here: http://sgrl.csiro.au/storage/insects/beetles_moths/Egyptian_beetle.html  yes, its ugly isn't it...oh well...at least its not dangerous. i kno it says it spit out icky stuff when threatened but the guy sed that he has NEVER seen it do that so...i'll be the judge of that later eh?  Anyway - ta-da i posted!  cya!
