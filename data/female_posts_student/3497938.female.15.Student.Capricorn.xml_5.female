I didnt go to church this morning, I was feeling just blah. So Rusty calls me and tells me to come tonight because we r goin to Brittany's church and our church is singin with theirs. So I go and he's not even there. *lol, typical rusty thing* It was a pretty boring service, but me and Lauren and Chelsea messed around and played with our flags. *lol* After that, we all (me, lauren, chelsea, michelle, mrs ollie, and kenny) went to Krystals to get sumthin to eat. We decided to sit outside until it started to rain. Kenny looks at us and says head to the van. We get in and start the van and it starts pouring! Go kenny. Then my grandma picks me up ad we come home. And here I am. Now im waiting on Chelsea so we can go to NEOPETS!!! *lol, chelsea*
