The highlights of June included the following: meeting Tom's adorable best friend Casey as well as his friends Sam, Ben, BK, Eric, and Jared. I ended up going to their afterprom party at Herndon (To this day, I still don't have any clue how I managed to sleep over at the hotel without the parentals finding out!) The party was fucking amazing...I got piss drunk, got naked in the shower and hot tub and then passed out/ hooked up on the bed with Casey. Somehow Tom and I never seemed to hit it off. He definately isn't my type and has earned the title of a "stalker". No joke, believe me. I'll explain later on *sigh* In admidst studying for finals, I atended Langley's prom. Of course the best part was the beautification process. If you want to see pics from prom and just me in general...you can go to yahoo photo gallery. urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/cutedancer03  Laura was such a bitch at Prom and the entire night for that matter. She basically got pissed that her date, who was an old family friend, was more into me than her. For example, she refused to let him even dance with me! *Arghh* Anyways, I ended up going to Prom single, which wasn't too bad. Kristin, who went to Herndon's afterprom with me, (ka my other half since we have so much in common!!) shared her date with me. Haha, we basically had a threesome going on...ahhh...hehehehe good times.
