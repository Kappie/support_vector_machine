It was one of the memorable moments in our lives since it was the first time that we were able to sing for him since he's always out of town when it's his birthday. It was also a tearful gathering since he'll be leaving for Hawaii this Thursday, and he caught a flight for Manila at 1:15 earlier in the afternoon.  We said goodbye to him though we tried our best not to shed anymore tears...we just couldn't help it. He's so much a part of our lives that it's kinda difficult that he just left and we won't be able to see him after 3 long years. I lost a confidant...a great friend...Though i gave him my e-mail and we'll probably chat after a while, it's still different that when he's around.  'Dre, I hope you'll have fun in Hawaii...wala say balikas karong panahona...we'll surely miss you and just keep in touch...tell Father Edgar to make a blog as well, just follow the instructions i wrote at the back of the card...and you'll never lose your way. Pray for me always...thanks...and we love you!
