Well, so much has happened man.. Got lodsa to tell you!!      Firstly, I got someone new in my life.. Hehe.. Wont mention his name yet here.. But im pretty much sure u got the idea who.. Hehehe.. Im accidentally in love with him... He keeps me happy and he make my everyday!! Well.. We're not really official yet but I guess.. Its gonna be soon.. Hehehe..      Okay.. So on Saturday,I had this stupid POA thingy at Ngee Ann Poly. We got 4th.. Didnt win anything.. But who cares anyway.. The strange thing tt happened to me that day was when i went to the stupid bloody toilet at the block.. The metal door of the toilet pierced into the back of my heel.. Imagine the pain.. Thats not all.. I didnt feel any pain at all in the 1st place so i just went to the cubicle to ease myself.. Strangely,when i entered the cubicle,my hairs stood at the ends.. And i suddenly felt so dizzy rite after I came out of the cubicle.. All i know, within split seconds, I was on the floor.. Felt so damn dizzy.. Everything was almost pitch black.. And I could see stars arnd.. Seriously,Im not kidding.. I really thought I saw stars arnd Ms Fok's face. So the ppl attended first aid to me.. Which really sucked cos halfway the bandage came off.. Ms Fok put us in a cab all the way to Bedok Mrt (thanks eh!!) and lucky 4 me.. By tt time i was okay already.. Went to meet someone.. Hehehe.. And he sent me back to my grandmother's place cos we had my yayi's 40 death days prayers thingy.. Malays call it Tahlil. Yep... Saw my cuzinz and all.. They and my aunties/uncle saw the foto I took together with him.. Commented tt he was handsome and had a nice body. Hehehe.. The whole thing ended quite late.. I went home at arnd 10 plus.. I missed yayi.. So did everyone.. (Love you.)   And that particular nite.. My sis told her her bf what happend to me at Ngee Ann which happens to be his own sch and guess wat he told her..? Tt blk's toilet (the one i went into) was actualy rumoured to be haunted cos some girl commited suicide in there.. So much 4 empathy..      My Sunday was not tt bad.. Spent the whole day at hme again.. Doing nothing.. Just smsing someone all day.. Hehehe.. School started again on Monday.. And it was usual too. Yesterday... Tuesday!! Had POA enrichment course.. So fun! My team won!! Yeahh!! And then I went home straight cos I wanted to get somethings at Tampines later on.. Reached hme at 5.30 and changed and all.. Well, I actualli got accompanied by my 'someone'. Hehehe.. He waited at my bus stop at arnd 7.15.. And we went to get my things la.. After tt.. Walked at TM for awhile.. Only to run into 2 damaians.. Haiz..We bought ice creams at Mcdonalds and ate behind the Tamp Mrt Station.. Yeah..Sat there and talked 4 awhile.. B4 i went home at 8.30 like dat..We took the same bus,65.. Cos he's gona meet his friends nearby..I gave him a kiss b4 he dropped off.. Hehehe.. Woo.. Im in love...      So today.. My day has been so far so good. Didnt have Physics test cos everyone played hide and seek with that stupid relieve teacher.. B4 that.. Met him 4awhile then after his study hr,met him again.. Then after his dt.. Met him again.. Hahaha.. He sent me hme until outside my lift. Hehehe.. Got a kiss frm him.. In school!! *embarassed*      Okok.. So i really dun like this friend of his and she in return dun like me too. Obviously,i dun care la..We're still trying not to let anyone know abt us yet.. My friends all know of cos... But regardless to his friends especially his gerl-friends.. We still try to keep it low..
