There is one other girl here who is remotely my age (she's 21) and she's a close friend of the family, like my mother is her sister and brother's godmother, etc. And we've become pretty um...I guess you could say close as I started working here. And well, sometimes we get on the subject of homosexuality. And I know she wouldn't really judge me, and she would accept me, but it's still a scary thing to do, to tell someone, "I'm bisexual". It's not like I'm saying, "I'm really a man!" or something, but it's hard nonetheless, and it drives me nuts, 'cuz I just want to say it sometimes, and I can't. The fact that I also find her kind of attractive is also probably a factor, but I would never tell her that, lol, that would just be wierd. Although I'm sure she wouldn't mind it necessarily, lol, she'd probably be flattered, but I mean really, she's known me since I was a tiny baby, how do you tell a person who's so close to you something like this?   I hate hiding things. My own mother knows, and she doesn't say anything to anyone necessarily, but I mean she knows, and she accepts me for it, for the most part. It's my perception that she kind of sees it as a "phase"...but when she found out I had had girlfriends, and that I had been um..."intimate" with other girls...she realized that I wasn't just going through a "phase".  Maybe one day I'll just blurt it out, lol.  I remember Ms. Franks talking to me about how when she came to Cheshire Academy, she had to go back in the closet. She had been out of the closet for so many years, but she suddenly entered this environment where she couldn't do that anymore. It might have put her job in jeopardy. When she finally came out, and started to bring her partner around the school more, I was so happy for her. She felt much better once she did that, and I could tell, she looked more comfortable.  Now she and her partner are having/had a baby. I haven't been updated yet, but her partner was pretty far along the last time i saw her. I hope everything went well, and that they finally chose a name!  But I digress.  I suppose in this setting, I mean, these people are older, and um...I don't know accepting they would be versus Carissa, who is 21 and open minded. I could tell Carissa...I couldn't tell the others. I don't know how I could show my face around here anymore if I did. Maybe when I'm a little older, I could say something...not now.   *sigh*  I don't even know why it's bugging me. I just, wish it were easier to be yourself in the world, no matter what differences you posess in comparison to others.   In other, unrelated news, my boss has left for the day, so I'm slacking off now, lol. I have to send her an e-mail before I leave though, but that's at like, 4 o'clock, and then I get to pick up Cameron :D  Yay :)
