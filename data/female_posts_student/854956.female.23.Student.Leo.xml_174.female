I got some special words from Scuba Steve yesterday in reference to Valentine's... so that's made me significantly more happy about today than I normally would be.  ; )  Now, I'm off... I will be meeting up with Justin and his new fiance Amanda in a bit...  Fun Fun Fun!  I'll post more later... maybe... ; )
