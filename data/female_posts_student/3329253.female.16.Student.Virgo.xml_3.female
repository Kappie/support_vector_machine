Midterms are scary  Oh um I know! I was just talking to nick ,and the words that I most often use are "good", "great" and "awesome!" because I am either good, great, or awesome! - if anyone has ever noticed..(although its hard not to notice.) hehe ohh and we told everyone about Nick and I going out. Chu took it rather well - haha a little over hyper but quite well! And then Willy was like "no surprise there." and then Kau was like...Well there's a lot to what Kau said. Here it is according to Nick --> and if memory serves well:  Nick walked into his hallway and one of his friends is like "Hey Who's your new  girlfriend ?" and Nick figured that chu has been talking about it. And then Kau is like "you have a new girlfriend? Already?" and Nick's like "yea" and then Kau was like "do I know her?" and nick was like "yea it's Donna" and then kau is like - well lets just say I was worried of the awkwardness of it where two friends meet who meet two more friends and one of the original friends adds a friend and then the two friends that the two original friends have met pulls another guy into the loop. And then the other new guy and one of the original friends starts going out --> although the outcome was awesome! hehe they have taken it quite well, quite well indeed! And its awesome because its almost like people expected it to happen, without us even realizing it.   Come to think of it, it's kind of scary - in a good way.
