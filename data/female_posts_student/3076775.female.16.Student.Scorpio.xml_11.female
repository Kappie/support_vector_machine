Oh! we had to use a diaper to light our fire, cuz the wood was all wet. lol, it was so funny! Today was alright...I guess. We didn't do much today, which was fun, BUT it was a bit of a disappointment as well. I sound like such a spoiled brat, but I just feel like me and Nick are cursed! I tell you, we're never going to spend any time together AT ALL!!!!! I've been on the verge of tears all afternoon after I got home and learned he wasn't going to the Exchange. I mean, it's not HIS fault, it's mine..I suppose I'm expecting too much. ah well, I'll get over it. I always do. ^_^; but I can't help but feel disappointed. I mean, I love spending time with Nick, and when I don't get to, it feels like someone offered me a present or something like that and then decided to take it away...sorry Nick! I'm not try to make you feel bad or anything. Tommorrow me and chelsea are going to see a movie. That'll be fun. I can't wait! haven't got to hang out with Chelsea much all week!!! I love spending time with you too, Chelsea! lol ^^ Well, must go. Love, Shannon "Happiness depends upon ourselves." Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC)
