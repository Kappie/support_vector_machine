I  never fucking leave new york, probably because there isn't much out there. New Years resolution 2004 is to LEAVE  and go on tour. New Yorkers are so closeted here, it's ridiculous.  Funny Story.  When i first moved to Valley Stream, Long Island (which is literally 3 blocks from queens) My friends would take the bus to the border refusing to actually leave queens and god forbid those manhattan friends that went to stuyvesant highschool. They NEVER fucking left manhattan until Williamsburg became the NEW downtown. WHAT THE FUCK! we are so geographically incestuous that instead of actually leaving new york, we just create new and trendy neighborhoods to go to , oh wait THAT's just plain ole gentrification but wait, how many times has the downtown scene been reinvented?   comments? deathreats?        urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide
