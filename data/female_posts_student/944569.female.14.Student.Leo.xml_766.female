YAY :D  hehe... makin' sushi eh? One time I made sushi with my cousins and I put way too much wasabi in one. My aunt tasted in and she got all red and was like, "ahhhh! it's so hot!! water! water! Who made that one?" (or something like that). And then i was like, "umm.. i did." So then, no one ate my sushi. They were all too scared. lol.   Anyways, I'll try to write more later (if i remember). :D
