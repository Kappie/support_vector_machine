I went to our "new church" in the mornin....It was weird...almost nobody was in the traditional "church dress"....Everyone had on jeans and sweatshirts.....really weird...what happened to respect...but w/e....  Anyways it was regular church beyond that.  I saw lotsa people my age there, didn't talk to them, but i did see them...  Then we came home and i played some motorcycle racing game on the Xbox...it was boring.  Then we went to the YMCA to go swimming.  We went into the indoor pool.  the one thing that bugs me about indoor pools is that they are so freakin chloriney....When we came home i had to put the little droppeys in my eyes about 3 freakin times, cus they burned like heck.  Then we came home and i played this sniper game on the xbox, i think it was the scariest video game i've ever played.  It was in this insane asylum and there were all these insane people walking around and then in rooms some were cutting up people!....i thought they were gunna get me!...how scary...anyways then i had ribs fer dinner then i played more xbox and thats about it..........how fun, my day was really boring..........oh well...Im Out
