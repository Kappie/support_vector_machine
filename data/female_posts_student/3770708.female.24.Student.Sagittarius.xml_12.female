They plan to rip up the "islands" of grass and trees in order to make our parking spots bigger. There is a towering, giant Norfolk pine that will die tomorrow so the SUVs can park more spaciously. As well as half a dozen small, swaying palm trees, and large areas of breezy grass. In their place, we will be blessed with a shimmering expanse of asphalt. My heart hurts.  To make matters worse, we have two and a half hours to find someone to tow our truck, which failed to awaken when we tried to start it. Kidney Cars won't accept it, and it's way too heavy to push, though we may try anyway.   Yesterday a man with a white mask came by to spray poison on all our doorfronts. No warning, no explanation. No time to remove our babies, or close the windows, or make sure our cats are safe. La-di-da, poison and asphalt for everyone. It's the American way.
