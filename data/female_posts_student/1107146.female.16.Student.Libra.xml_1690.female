Speaking of, can anyone help me with the essay question: "Compare Northeastern and Southeastern colonies economically, religiously, educationally, and politically"?  I was there for the Southeastern ones, but I skipped out (ok, doc appt.) for the Yankee ones.  I really really really need help on it, so if anyone knows anything about it, call me ASAP.  I don't care what time it is.
