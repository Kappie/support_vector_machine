(yeah. right.) oh well. people tell me that i don't update enough. yeah, whateva. so my birthday is coming up. i turn fifteen. that is some pretty cool stuff.so, i think that's about all. i just thought that i should check in, you know, let everyone know i'm not dead or anything, and then just go. there really is nothing to talk about.
