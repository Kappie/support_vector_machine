Better late than never, man. The day of opening, we advertised in the cafeteria during all three lunches using our very own singing and dancing skills, so not a single person in school that day could say they didn't know about Grease. I also stole a Grease flyer off the wall. I couldn't help myself. My kleptomania took over when I saw that purple-and-yellow-polka-dotted poodle. Especially when it said "Tickets: Wedensday, $5.00. Thursday-Saturday, 8:00." underneath the beloved, diseased canine. I then went home to get ready. Opening night was awesome. It's completely impossible for words to do justice to the energy of opening night. That goes for any show. The next night, my family came. My dad had a telegram delivered to me backstage, along one dozen red roses later during the show. My mom gave me another boquet of roses. Fuck, I was just in the chorus. I'm honestly afraid to imagine what they'd do if I had a lead. I love them. Friday night's performance was probably the worst of the four, even though we still kicked some seriously obese ass. After the show, everyone went to Applebees and hung out 'till midnight. Saturday night, closing night, was pretty extreme. Despite the sadness of the last show, we had a full house and a standing ovation. We also all got programs. I played  Follow the Whoever-the-fuck-was-the-Leader  and had everyone sign my program. Directly after the show, we had strike, then all decided to go to Ruby Tuesday's. No....wait....Applebees. No, Bickford's. Hold on...T.G.I.Friday's. Dude....we went to Bickford's. That's right. Bickford's. After an hour of confusion, Joyce and I got a ride from Katie, one of the funniest people in the whole fucking Milky Way, and went to Bickford's.  Now, I'm not sure of the rules, but I don't think you're supposed to go to a restaurant, be seated, and order nothing but a water. Whoops. On the other hand, because of the fact that I was there with a hundred other people, I don't think they really noticed nor cared. La Fin. Well...of Grease, anyway.  Stay tuned. More of  Maddie's Life During Her Insanity-Leave  to come.
