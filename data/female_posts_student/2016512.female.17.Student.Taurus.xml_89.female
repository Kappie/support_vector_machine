Graduation went alright. (i got my hair cut. yay!...two days later might i add) i'd like to thank all the people who felt sorry for me. yes, i know i was bawling so you can just drop it. and no i am not confined to a wheel chair and yes i accepted the tissue gladly. grr. why are all my friends graduating? this bites...but anyways i should be alright for 2 months or so. you just watch out for me around August.  graduation night was fun. i played a rousing game of Life with Tabitha, Giles, and Lily. I'm proud to say that we quit and it had a pleasant irony. i married Jude and that was good enough for me. ;)  the rest of the weekend has been filled with receptions galore. i'm getting sick just thinking about it. yuck no more sandwiches or punch. oh god not the punch. they were all lovely despite the punch. mwah to Tabitha, Iris, Liona, and Mona your parties were "jumpin'".  Followin the festivities there was a shindig at Iris' home where East Guh Funk lads and lassie came out for a visit. it was very enjoyable. we played mafia and i find it ironic that if the group picked between the killer and the detective, they would obviously kill the detective. grr. oh well it was fun none the less.  I also had to play for a really pretty wedding. I got the usual comment from Mr Music Man saying that, "Don't you think the music was a little fast?" I'm sorry we don't take every song at 116 bpm like you do. *sigh* that was really the only urksome moment. I played at 11 o'clock mass this morning also. it was fine. not spectacular, but alright. oh well...i have reason to judge my playing because, dang it, i know when i'm good. and it was tough to get up this morning since i was at Iris' till 1am but i guess that wasn't very late compared to some.  today hasn't been tobad. had a two receptions which i figure is the perfect amount. and plus i wasn't hungry so it really made it easy to walk through and just do nothing. p.s my poppy came home with LOTR: Return o' The King. i got kind of mad because my family seems to have a trend with these films. example: we have one vhs, one dvd, and one extended version of the Fellowship; one dvd, and one extended version of the Two Towers; and now to have a dvd of Return of the King...do you know where this is going?...i thought so too.  Diagonally, ah crap, -Betso
