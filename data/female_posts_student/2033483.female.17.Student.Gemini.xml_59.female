Then around 8 we boarded the bus and were off to the cities.  Four hours, one trip to Wendy's, and numerous games of Mafia later we were there.  The U of M campus is huge!  Since we arrived early, we broke off into groups and toured the campus on our own.  I've never wanted to be in college so bad!  College taught Renae time it was great!  "Kayla, 1 o'clock is really cute!"  One guy came up to Jessica and me and asked us to vote for this candidate that was running for class president.  I told him I couldn't vote b/c duh I don't go there, but Jess just took the flyer and told me I should have told him we didn't go to school there and he would have stopped bothering us sooner.  Oh well, live and learn.  The tour we had there was rather boring and the tour we had at their daily was rather boring too.  But I like the daily tour better than the other one.  Then we went to our hotel.  It turned out to be rather nice.  Renae, Alisha and I room together.  We made Renae sleep on the floor or she volunteered I'm not really sure anymore I just know Renae slept on the floor.  Heidi and Jen were bitching about having to go to the mall instead of a sit down restaurant and pouted the rest of the night after they didn't get their way.  Oh well!  After the mall we all sat in the hall and talked b/c of some retarded rule that says no girls in guys rooms and no guys in girls rooms.  But Logan was in our room...We couldn't let him be with Kaufman the entire time that is just cruel.  Mr. Powers came to us and told us to beware of the boys golf team from Fargo that was also staying on our floor because he didn't know them so he didn't trust them.  Later on in the night when Renae and I were sitting in the hall we met two of the boys.  The one was really cute but both were really nice.  Apparently, they were here for a tournament and they asked why we were there and we told them and we found out they were both juniors.  I don't know what Mr. Powers was worried about.  I loved it when Renae said "When being rebels don't tell teacher."  Because after that I think someone complained about us because we were sent to our rooms and told to go to bed at 10:30.  Which I will say we were more then pissed about because the sheet clearly says in black in white lights out at 11 o'clock.  Their was some more drama that went on but I'll refrain from writing about it in here.  The next morning we were up at 6:30 and down to breakfast at by 7.  I was sick again but what else is new.  When we were bring all our things down to load the bus we met the cute golf boy at the elevator and he told us to have fun on our tour so I told him good luck with his golf.  Now you may ask why I refer to him as golf boy and not his name...I do not know his name.  You see Renae and I forgot to ask.  Moving on, the WCCO tour was interesting when we saw the set but other than that my feet hurt from standing for so long.  I did like the mini tour we took of downtown before hand.  Then we drove some 20 miles to a Taco Bell because Miss Heidi wanted Taco Bell.  I was still sick and didn't want to look at food.  I ate though and felt better.  Funny how that is.  The Star Tribune tour was a waste because I didn't really care how they made the paper.  I do know however that that building is a direct result of why the rainforest is disappearing.  Their were rolls of paper that weighted 2000 lb.  Filling a warehouse.  Finally, we were done and on our way back home.  I think at one point everyone on the bus was asleep.  But weird lady chaperone that came with us was so loud and never shut up the entire ride home.   She ended up waking all of us up with her voice.  We all agreed it was Mr. Powers punishment because she was talking to him.  I went to bed last night at 8:30 and woke up this morning at 7 for my AE interview.  That was crap.  It was a group interview.  Yeah I know.  I know I didn't get it I can just kinda feel it.  So the job hunt continues.    3 more days!
