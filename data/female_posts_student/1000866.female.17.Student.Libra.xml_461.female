I absolutely LOATHE the word whatever when used as a single word response. “OK, I’m going to go now.” “Whatever.”  It just seems so callous and ambivalent (Sat/Com buzz word. Wow, Ms. Gatto would be proud). Like, one really doesn’t care what others feel or do. My deep ceded abhor for the word isn’t recent either. It’s just been galling me a lot more lately as I hear it used more often. That and, “luv,” but I wont even start on that one. That’s for my next rant…  Well, now that that’s out of the way, I can go on to bigger and …better? No, not better, well, at least bigger things. Today was a Monday. And I mean that in the true sense of the definition. My energy (what minute amount I began with) tapered off by…oh 6:45. I woke up at 6:00’ish. 45 minutes of energy. And if only 45 minutes of energy isn’t bad enough, it was wasted on the morning. Mornings are evil too. Wow, there’s so much evil in this world. Or maybe I’m just eccentric. Either way…it bites. I think I’m going to make a list of everything that is evil or has the potential to be evil tomorrow.  I definitely have to work on my tape for the seating auditions for Wednesday. Yeah, I forgot my trumpet at school this weekend. That’s not helping me. Not at all. Oh well. I got a C on my math test. Heh. Oh well. It just surprised me more than anything I suppose. I haven’t gotten a C in math in ages.   I picked coed gymnastics for P.E. Exciting, ‘eh? French, I found out I have a 96.99% so I think I’m OK in there, and lunch…blah. It was nice actually, but the mood was blah. Actually, “blah” is really a poor word to describe the mood. It was more, “We’re really mad at the world, so…let’s vent!” but, is there a word for that? I don’t know. I think I need to start reading the dictionary before I go to sleep every night.   U.S. History was tedious as usual and Sat/Com was actually my relief of the day. We’re in the Irony unit right now so it’s almost placating to know others are as annoyed with the world as I am.   Jazz starts tomorrow. I can’t decide if I’m looking forward to it or if it’s going to suck like last year. Last year was really a huge disappointment for me. I think I’d rather be in Jazz Lab with Mr. Silder teaching than be in the higher band and learn nothing from Mr. Alstadt.   Then, Friday, because the football team won last Friday, we have a game that we’re actually playing at. Yay…  Um, no. Not so much.  I’m leaving for Michigan at like…4:00 the next morning. Ahhh, I’m going to be so tired at the end of this weekend.  The only thing I’m really looking forward to this week is late arrival sadly. I know it’s terrible but it’s the truth.  And, Brett just actually said something that made this all seem a little better, but then I realized how pathetic it is that this is what made me feel better. He asked me, “Are you alright?”  Not many people truly ask me that. Actually, no one’s sincerely asked me that in a long time. Maybe my mother. If I didn’t think it’d freak him out, I probably would have just started to tell him everything that’s going on. What I’m thinking and such.  You know…the amazing part of this all is I’m not PMS’ing. Heh. I was just thinking to myself, “Why the heck are you in such a bad mood?” And I though PMS instinctively, but I realized that’s not it so I’m sure there’s something else. Usually there’s something I won’t admit to myself. Something I don’t realize for a while or at least let myself realize…  But really…I’ve been typing for too long and I need to sleep.
