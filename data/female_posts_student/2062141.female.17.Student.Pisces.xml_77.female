Oh man it was so fun, 6th period I got to leave math for rehearsal for the assembly on monday (which is gonna suck btw) but then someone else was using my cello and you know what fuck it I don't know the songs I've been gone for two weeks they sound horrible and god dammit I deserve to sit out. It rocked, I just sat on the floor hoping Hibbard wouldn't notice while I listened to my cds and laughed at how horrible we sound. But I don't care. I'll just bullshit it on Monday and make fun of Jess for sounding like crap. Hahaha that was fun. Then me and Charlotte went to Earthcore and hung out at her house and pretended that we were going to do our homework, what a laugh. Literally, cause we can't be around eachother without cracking up. Good times.  This week has been interesting... most of all I've decided to just pull things together more.. you wouldn't believe how much homework I have. And I'm done wasting my time with pointless things. And people. I've wasted so much effort on people who will never return the favor. I'm too forgiving and I'm too nice. I don't know why I bother. So I won't.
