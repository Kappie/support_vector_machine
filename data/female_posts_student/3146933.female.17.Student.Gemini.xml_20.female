Me and Monica followed Brad to Corey and Ashley's and they were shootin fireworks..uhh well when we pulled up in the drive-way..there were TONS of cars there...I was like..wtc..whoa..haha b/c it was supposed to be me and brad and monica and forrest and corey n ashley as far as I knew...I guess..but yeah Derek was there and so was Ashleigh Venable and her b/f Jason Hadden..so me and Monica kinda talked to them for a while .. and Derek gives us a nice "welcome" he walks up to us and he's like "hey" and turns around to walk off and he throws a bottle rocket back over his shoulder at us! lmao! oh God...I ran to his car .. that way he wouldn't be throwin them at me! :D I'm smart like that. So after a few min..most ppl leave..the ones we didnt know neway and Forrest, Brad, Corey, Brandon Wilhelm and Derek all went in the back yard and had this freakin bottle rocket fight. Was very funny. Dereks pants were freakin saggin cuz he had so many stashed in all 4 pockets lmao! We got front row seats toO! they have a screened in back porch so we could sit there n watch the whole thing. Gah it was crazy!! Well whatever. I've had fun at least! The other nite I went to Adrienne's with Adrienne, Jermiah, Brett and Jessica. Then Erik came over at the end and then Monica came over lmao! Whole buncha people up in Adrienne's lil computer room. Was pretty fun. Jus sat around and talked and Adrienne got on webcam and showed everyone her friends! haha she's so crazy! Then...uh...Erik and Monica came over to my house last nite and we got on my computer and we played pool and talked to Adrienne..then..later that nite Monica called dad and asked if I could stay the nite w/ her and so I did...and while we were at Wal-Mart earlier she got a webcam so when we got to her house we hooked it up and was like...invitin everyone lmao.
