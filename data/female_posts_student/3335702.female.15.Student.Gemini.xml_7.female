Wednesday, July 21st, 2004   6:47 pm   I dont know what i have to do or say to make someone love me like i do them. all the things that were done and said between us meant nothing to you. it braks my heart to know i still love you. maybe one day ill be over you or maybe not, but i have to try to hold my head up and live life one day at a time. it hurts more to just wake up everyday than it does to be stabbed or shot. I hate my sensitivity to life in general. fuck i cant even kill a ant without feeling guilty.         That's harsh, but Itotally feel for him and understand what he's going through. I wish he could see his situation like I see it. He needs someone with more depth, his last girlfriend hung up on him because he couldn't get to the mall to meet her? She's going to crush him for something stupid like that? I really wish I could help him with his heartache, I hate seeing people like this, because after Mike ended our relationship, I felt totally the same. His sensitivity is amazing, I admire the fact that he's brave enough to show it. He has a heart and that's something I find amazing, he's got something unique. I love it. Maybe none of this is my business, but I think he's looking for love in the wrong places.
