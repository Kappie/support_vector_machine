I ran to the tree And grabbed a gift I jumped up and down And shook a bit I yelled for Mom Then for Dad I waited a minute Then got sad I ran upstairs And looked around I knocked on their door Then heard a sound I smiled widely And opened the door I stared in shock They were on the floor I burst into tears As I stared ahead I fell to my knees My parents were dead.
