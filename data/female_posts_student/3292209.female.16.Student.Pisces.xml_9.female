(they are fake so dont think im a crazy psyco)(that would have been so much cooler if i could have spelled psyco right)Anyway back to subject. nails.  i get them done every two weeks when i have them on.  sigh.  my mother says that i have to give my nails a breathe.  they are kinda torn up, but who cares when one has known the wonders of acrylic nails.  they somehow give you a boost.  you know you look good, and so you feel good. (sniffle) has anyone ever realizaed  that a bunch of the freshmen are in a higher math than the majority of the sophemores? something is wrong when people are that smart. this is america. were supposed to be fat, stupid people with no sense of class!  what is the world coming to.  i think it is so stupid that people sue fast food places because they're fat.  its your own damn fault that you just had to have the supersized combo.  when i was in spain, i noticed that in the one mcdonalds that we went to, there were no super sized combos. there were only reasonably sized meals. lord! how do tourists live? i cannot believe that were doing shakespeare for the play in the fall. o my gosh i have to sing at bravo. a solo! we are going to be so bad. i only know half the songs. this definitly was supposed to be about nails and it ended about bravo with obesity in between.  i hope that people can see a little of how my mind works and that the seemingly random things that pop out of my mouth really aren't random. HA!   My life is your entertainment.(i hope its good)
