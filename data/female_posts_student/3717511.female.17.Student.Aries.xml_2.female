I know everyone is quivering with anticipation, waiting for the words to pour like honey from my luscious lips...or fingers rather, since I am typing. So for those so excited to hear from me they could pee their pants--which I doubt is anyone,really--I will tell you what I did today.  10:30--rose from the dead and consumed shredded wheat with soymilk 10:45--drove self to work. Still damaged from last year's wreck. So hard to turn! So afraid! Riding in the tin death box.ahhhg! 11:00--arrived and began to lazily sift through my box of checks and deposits. Pointed and clicked for several hours. Entered clear dates. Finally printed out reports at around 12. Ate other peoples snacks I found in the fridge....Continued working until 3. Very productive day.hurrah for me. 3:oo--arrived at father's office. Began to clean. Dropped paperweights all over the place.  5:oo--came home and sprayed pesticide all over mother's plants. Forgot to wash the pesticide off my hands and ate watermelon and left over Thai food from last night. Lets hope I don't die slowly. Quickly could be tolerable. 6ish--went to neighbors(im still in pajamas, mind you.) and gave them their mail, which I have been picking up while they've been on vacate. Ksenia (aka Oxana, the Russian with road rage) and I decided that we would head out to Target and Tj Maxx. I found some cute pointy shoes for 13 bucks--a friend of mine calls them roach stompers because you can still squash the things when they scamper into corners--and a pretty little feminine skirt with pink and green floral print and a ribbon at the top. I also found a non hideous strapless nude bra for 6 bucks. This purchase is my pride and joy, "why?" you ask...its one of those deceptive watery gel bra things.The bra lies! The bra tells lies!! Guys think the girl really has boobs...feel real under the shirt! shirt and bra go away...boobs disappear! abracadabra! that is what I shall call it. My abracadab-Bra. YAy!
