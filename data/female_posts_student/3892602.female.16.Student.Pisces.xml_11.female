Well, maybe not  brilliant,  but hell, what am I supposed to do?  rrr...  So anyway, I'm quite gosh darn happy right now, due to the fact that I am able to go to a Pirates game on Friday! w00t!  Ya know, Pittsburgh Pirates, the baseball team?  The one that frickin'   loses   every game??? Oh well...fun anyway.    Go see Spider-Man 2.  I've seen it five times in theaters and I'm going with my friends come Saturday to see it again.    I love Spider-Man! urlLink Robespierre
