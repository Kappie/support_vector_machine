I'm not naming names, (but if you went, you might catch on...) I think that's why I made new friends and didn't spend so much time with the other LC kids. They got to be a tad bit irritating. Speaking of "tad" I made some new friends that were from LC as well, and got closer to some of the other girls in our group. I think that was what God wanted me to do- branch out and meet new people and strengthen some of the bonds with the ones I didn't know too well.  I took a "survey" this morning, it was different...but fun.
