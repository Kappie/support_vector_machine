Last night as I laid in bed attempting to get to sleep I realized I didnt get to my blog. So I will make it up today. Yesterday was one of those days that seem to fly by. Nothing really happened. I did some laundry. Made dinner. Caught up on a few things here and even got in about 20 minutes of reading. Last night when I finally was able to try to go to bed all heck broke loose. First M. called which was fine. Then Dave came in asking me to set my alarm for 5 so he could get up early to go to work early. Then my sister called saying she will have a lay over at Seatac airport on Thursday morning it will be nice to visit with her. She is moving to Idaho getting away from the "family".. Then joey comes into my room in tears becasue he realized that he and Teira wont work out. His first sexual encounter, his first heart break. He told me he wants AC to come home becuase I told him we might be moving out of state. He wants to he wants a fresh start. He's very tired of being known as "Tony the troublemaker's kid brother" and Tony wants a fresh start where no one knows him as a troublemaker due to medication problems. With us needing to move I wish now more then anything that we could move away. I dont know when / if it will happen. I finally got to sleep woke up a few minutes before 5 to wake up Dave and when I got into the livingroom to wake him up he tells me "I didnt get to sleep until after 2:30 and I am not going to go in until 7:30 wake me up at 7" I was so pissed. Plus when I woke up and got into the livingroom I saw what a disaster it was. When I went to bed it wasnt "clean" but it was picked up and now there is all sorts of trash laying around. The dishes that were used while I was sleeping are scattered and popcorn was spilled.. so I get to clean all that up. I'm also going to be making some calls about a place to move to. I hate calling when I have no money to even put down.. but I have to find something. I kept thinking that AC is sleeping next to me. I can almost feel him and I sleep so much easier. Well should close and do the "stuff" here.
