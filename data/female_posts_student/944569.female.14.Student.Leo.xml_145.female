Ganbatte!)  and that Sakuno's will be coming soon in January...erm.. I'm kinda strange, no?  I'm one of the only ppl in the grade that watch anime.  Frankly....I'm the only girl that watches anime in the grade...Huh..... I think i'm also the only one to play rpg games like FF7 and all the Final Fantasy series as well as Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.... Actually...Stacey used to play FF7 too.... I'm getting confused. I'm much more different than the other girls.  Instead of posters of male celebrities in my room, the majority are anime posters (2 Prince of Tennis posters, one Inu Yasha, Gundam Endless Waltz and Naruto...I used to have a Sailor Moon roll out poster but i gave that away...it was actaully quite pretty with all the flowing blue background and smooth yet blurry collections of dreamy colours....).  I dont wear skirts either.  Hmm.. I hate skirts and dresses.  They're not comfortable at all.  I also hate wearing makeup (i dont have anything with other ppl wearing it though.). Am i weird?  My mom says not to worry since I'm already very ladylike but in what ways?
