Do you ever wonder why when one of your wishes comes true it is not all it is cracked up to be. Well I do and I wonder why you wait your whole life for that one guy the one who is suppose to be your one true love how do you know that there is only one true love what if you neer find that true love I have no clue why I am writing about this but this is just what I started typing about. Well anyways school starts soon and I really dont want to go back to Alvarado b/c there is so much B*S* there, but I have so many memories and only two years there left and plus I dont know what I would do if I ever left my best friend Sarah she is like one of the only reasons I am gonna stay here well except for Lauren and amber who are freakin hilarous. I love most of my friends but some of them are just plain b*tches and hoes who I dont care to be around. Do you ever get tired of being someone for too long well I think that is how I am with high school I kind of want a change. I really cant wait for football season that is going to be awesome. I went over to Lindsays house for a little bit today and it was fun we looked at old pictures and I can not believe how retarded I looked when I was a kid but those were fun days when you didnt care about anything. I am so glad that I am almost done with high school b/c then I am off to college and out of here. I dont have anything interesting going on right now except for the fact that everyone thought my ex-boyfriend was a fag I kinda of thought he was gay but never really payed attention to it but I wish someone would have told me that everyone thought he was gay. I should have caught on when he started worrying about if his hair looked good or not. Well what can you do you only live once and you learn from your mistakes and I sure as hell hope that if he really is gay he finds himself a boyfriend and doesnt date anymore girls for cover ups b/c that is just messed up. This weekend I am either going out of town or to the movies I kind of hope to the movies but then again I want to go out of town b/c I dont ever spend time with my family but I know this is sad I just have more fun with my friends. I guess that is all I got to go. O yeah Sarah and I are not watching t.v. for 2 days lets see how long that will last?!     Love always,     Jess
