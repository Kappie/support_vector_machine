It probably wasn't all that bad I just made it seem horrible with elaborating my mind in melancholy details.  Saturday was fun, well...over half of the day was enjoyable. p.e.a.c.e is fun and being around some of the people there seems to cheer me up. After spending about 4 hours with them on saturday I went out to dinner with a friend and her sister, and then rented a movie which I expected to watch with her but ended up only watching it with her sister. But what can I say? Spending an hour on the phone with a boyfriend is much more enjoyable then watching a movie with me, and then going upstairs and "accidentally" falling asleep seems to be more amusing also. And for today, I slept, and read, and did some of my homework, and read, and slept, and put a butterfly on a t-shirt, and that's about it.  And now that I've gotten through this  exhausting  day I must drag myself up the steps and go to sleep before I fall asleep while I'm typing...
