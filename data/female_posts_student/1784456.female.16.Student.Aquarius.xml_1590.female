The ones destined to be coated in gold and stared at in awe - not to have shoes put on them. Why D? D for deranged, D for different, D for Dennis. Eventually, after about one hour in the Clarke's shop, and about five different people.... I HAVE SHOOOOES! Now all I need is socks, pants, a top and trousers and I'm fit to live in this world. I may have killed five slave labour children who were hurt when the shoes fell on them and killed them, but I finally have some. Hmm... on Sex in the City they have this whole shoe shopping fetish that goes on... *dramatic sigh... kind of like huh but more like oohioha* If only they sold stuff for big footed people *my bro's a size 13* Now that's manic!
