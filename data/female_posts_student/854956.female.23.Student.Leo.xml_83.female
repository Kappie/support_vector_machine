Frozen Yogurt or regular ice cream?  I like both, but prefer regular 3. Sherbet or Sorbet?  Sherbet 4. Shake or Malt?  Malt 5. Smoothie or Slushie?  Slushie 6. Cone or bowl?  Usually bowl, but recently I've been craving a cone 7. Ice cream cones: Waffle or Wafer?  Waffle! 8. With sprinkles or without?  Without 9. Caramel or Hot Fudge?  Hot Fudge... or better yet... melted peanut butter and chocolate syrup 10. Sonic, Dairy Queen, or Baskin Robbins?  For good ice cream... Baskin Robbins... For slushies/banana splits... Sonic...  For blizzards... Dairy Queen.  :-)
