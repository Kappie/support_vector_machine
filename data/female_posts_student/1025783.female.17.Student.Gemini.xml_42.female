Your mouth opens and you sing, arms flailing like birds, legs like a gazelles- you're so full of culture, so full of magic. Your song is too great for words, too beautiful to be tied down to one language. A thousand voices, a thousand tales, a thousand lives. All from your body- you leap and swing and bound and twirl- singing all the while. I sit perched on a rock, enraptured. SO this is why I love you.
