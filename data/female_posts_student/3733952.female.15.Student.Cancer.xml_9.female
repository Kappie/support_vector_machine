And it's like affecting everyone.  Like I said on the second day, it's boring. For me at least. I have music now. And I have to play about five different things. The bells, two cymbals, chimes, and a bucket. Mit is in the pit now too. So I guess it's not as bad for me now that I get to talk to him. He has these two mallets that I guess resemble me and Jack. He likes to do little puppet shows. *rolls eyes* The songs we play are really cool. The ballad is kinda slow, and I don't get it. But it's really pretty and "powerful". The opener and closer are really really fun to play, and I love the melodies.  There's like this director guy. He directs the pit. He's like harsh. He's in this rock and roll band but he always talks about classical music. He has a ponytail and he can't hear real well. I think it's because of all the years he's been beating timpanis. He likes dynamics. And he likes to show off. He's cool, but he bugs me at the same time. And there is this kid who was in the drumline, but he decided that marching was too hard. So he joined the pit. He can't read music, and he's always off. I think he's trying to hit on me. He wears to much cologne, and he always tries to do little things for me like putting my mallets away and carrying my stuff. It's rather bugful. I should mention to him that I have a boyfriend who is in the band. Maybe he'll back off then.  Poor Jack. Poor, poor Jack. He is so stressed. My poor baby. Marching is like hard. And it takes a lot of work. They have memorize their sets, and their music, and their everything. I just stand there with music in front of me. But I would much rather be in the band with the rest of the clarinets. I don't care how much work it would be, I wanna do work! And the director told us all today how much we suck. Yea, real nice, I know. This whole thing is making everyone so stressed. We are all like pissed at everything. Some worse than others. Well, there's only one more day. I'm sure we'll get better. We're gonna be the best band ever! Because I said so.  Well for some adventures... I already mentioned the puppet shows. Well, I had one of my mallets represent Mit. One day I was playing the cymbal with this mallet, and it broke. It just snapped in half. There goes Mit. Dead as a mallet. Beheaded he was. How sad... And today, Mit brought in the ingredients to make my famous dip. I call it My Dip. Because it's mine. And there is this microwave in the band room that everyone uses. Well, we made the dip, but the dish didn't fit in the microwave. So there we were, stuck. Well, we decided to use the plastic container that Mit brought the cream cheese in. It worked, and we got our very yummy dip. Some people tried it and they loved it. I think I should have gotten a watermelon for that. Seriously...  Running sucks, just leave it at that... Why would anyone run as a HOBBY. Seriously people. Do you enjoy like killing yourselves?! Don't answer that...  I'm tired. Can you tell? I should be in bed, but I'm not. So I'm leaving.  Bye!
