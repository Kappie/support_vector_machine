Ah well, I'm sitting here with Jack (one of sarah's dollys that she gave me to take care of, isn't that sweet?!) he's sitting in my lap.   So anyway, I'm listening to R.E.M-Losing my religion. I got a 100 on my Sweeney Todd test, actually i started with a 97 but he curved. I wish i had done better =/ *sigh* oh well. Oh now i'm listening to a song by smile empty soul, i think its called "this is war" (my cd player is on random shuffle) How was everyone's day? School was really really boring today..   School for tuesday:  -  It wasn't too bad. Finished all of my homework at school, so that always feels good. -  Ms. Langley made us all feel a little guilty today for not taking AP Chemistry next year. Should i do it? I want to have an easy year... but i like chemistry.. is it worth it? Comment on if i should take it or not.  -  We're doing calculus in pre-cal right now. Its not too bad. I get it *somewhat*  -  Umm... english, we're still reading The Importance Of Being Earnest -  Had our Sweeney Todd test, wish i had done better, but i'm still doing well in the class. I knew that play too! grrr -  Made my own lunch today. I packed myself some microwavable macaroni and cheese and i made it in the teacher's lounge. It wasn't too bad. i just got thirsty, but oh well. hehe -  Hmmm, what else, I really enjoy this 3-study hall thing. Its VERY very nice, i can finish all or nearly all of my homework every day! So awesome... hehe -  Campaigns started today for the Executive Council. I wish every one good luck! Just try your best. I don't know who I'll vote for yet. I rate depending on speeches, haha.  Okay I believe that is all for school today. I just got home, so i'll probably post some more later on tonight. I hope everyone has a good afternoon and evening. I don't know where Sarah is. I hope she texts/IM's/calls me soon! bye bye
