Check it out, Shakespeare in love as seen through allie’s eyes. ok so the first thing i remember is that I am in band and after we preformed we all went up to meet the queen. After i had greeted her or whatever but there were still people in line to see her, all these soldiers came and were like “alright who stole the priceless tiles” or something like that. Aprenently i was one of the revolutionists that did it so i ran with all these people in rags but like in Shakespeare like time clothes. So i start running with them and as i’m going i take off the band uniform and underneath i have like peasant clothes. So i become part of this peasant bandit club thing, but i’m still really rich at the same time, and I have to hide that i’m a revolutionary from my rich family (which still lives in the house i live in now, only like Shakespearized) and i have to hide the fact that i am rich from my bandit people’s. Well all but one. He doesn’t have a name.  But he looks like the guy that played Shakespeare in “ Shakespeare in love.” So we are all hanging out on some rooves in the slums. That guy gives me this charm thing, as a sign of love or something like that. Somebody mentions the play they are putting on, Romeo and Juliet. They need a juliet, bam, i get the part. So i have to sneak out of the house to get to the rehearsals. So i am back in my room and this woman who is supposed to be my mom is like trying to get me ready to meet the queen. So i have to where this really big red dress. My “mother” says that i have to wear my charm necklace, so we’re looking for all the charms on the floor. I have to wear one for my fiance to be or something along those lines, and one for my family and one for the queen one for my country and one for myself. I see the nameless man’s charm on the floor and i just put it on the necklace and say “i can’t remember who it’s for but better safe than sorry” when my “mom” leaves I take off the dress and i’m in a white slip thing and i’m trying to get on boys clothes or something, because my “mum” said that the nameless man was like actually rich. So i get dressed in these guys clothes, and i’m just about to sneak out the window when i hear the queen sneaking up the stairs, and suddenly i am back in just a slip, and i don’t want her to see me because she’ll know that i stole the tiles. So I hide behind the door and the queen is like “oh she’s not here lets go back downstairs” So then i come out of the door and then the queen opens the door again, and she sees me there, so I jump out the window and start running until i find the nameless man. Now i am in the boy’s clothes. We are like backstage. He starts kissing me. Then he notices my fiance’s charm on my necklace. He aks me what it is. And i say “you know i’m engaged, I have to wear the charm, but i wore yours too, i still love you. I had to lie though, to wear it” he said he understood. Then we had to go on stage and i was dressed in girls clothes again. At the end scene when we all bowed he looked at me like he knew that we couldn’t be together anymore. But then after the play we went outside. I was riding on his back and we were running through the park. It was good fun. Then we fall and we’re laying on a blanket in the park. And we start making out again. And we’re all like “ i love you so much” Then we see my fiance coming and we start to run, but it’s too late. He sees the nameless man and they start fighting. My fiance looses. Then me and the nameless guy go to a play or something and during the intermission there are all these like old basketball players and the stage is now a court. And i turn to the nameless man is like holding some other girls hand and i’m like “WHOA, what is this” and he goes “what who are you, stop holding my hand” and then to me he says “i swear i don’t know her, she’s just some girl i met on the bus” and i like groan. Then i slump down in  my seat. Then I woke up.
