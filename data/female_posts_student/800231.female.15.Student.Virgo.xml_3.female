I have to get contact lenses on Tuesday, I've had the same glasses since the 7th grade but I've rarely worn them. Anyway, they're all bent from being dropped and stepped on and occasionally abducted by my cat. I figure contacts are my only chance at being able to see properly...  I was looking forward to Mid-winter break until I looked at a calendar this morning. I'd completely forgotten that I was getting my wisdom teeth taken out then. On the plus side, large amounts of heavy duty pain killers are involved so at least I'll be delirious and happy that week.  My dad is a pain in the ass, he's rude to everyone. He went off on a little girl selling candy in a supermarket yesterday. Who in there right mind swears at a little girl?! God... He is even more horrid on weekends though. I spend all week relatively happy and then he comes along and starts telling me I'm useless or a bitch and that's the end of my happiness. He and my mum had a huge fight in the middle of a store a few weeks ago. You see, my mum is currently out of work but we are in NO way struggling for cash as my dad seems to think. Anyway, he pitched a fit when my mum suggested we go to a local Thai restaurant. After 20-30 minutes of yelling and swearing about being poor he bought $90 worth of expensive cheeses and beer.... Would someone please explain how that one conserves money? Besides, beer doesn't really go with fine cheese. Some people have no taste... So today, he decides we can't eat out and proceeds to go on a long tirade on saving money. My mum has just bought me at least $200 worth of clothing this week plus we eat out nearly every night. With this going on, I highly doubt we're that tight up for money. Thank God I only see him two days a week... *shakes head* He's just gone out for a pizza. I don't eat pizza, I haven't for several years now. He's purposely trying to make me angry. I don't care, I'll find my own food.  I wanna go take a really long bath, maybe that'll take my mind off things.
