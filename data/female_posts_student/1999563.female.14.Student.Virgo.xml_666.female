I am quite fond of Captain Underpants. Some other creative superhero include Charles: The Most Stupendous Superhero This Side of the Bermuda Triangle [that was of my brothers doing.], Pretty Ugly Man, Razmataz Man, Giant Lady, ETC. Get creative!!    Next you need to decide on your specail skill. Charles, for instance, is an expert hair braider. Make sure you choose your talent wisley!! [You need to save the world you know.]    Ok. So now you should have the following: A name for you alter-ego and a special talent. [You might want to write these down just incase you forget!]    Next, make up a problem that youcan solve using for special talent.    Pretend your Charlie....    OH NO!!!! THE WORLD'S HAIR IS A MESS!!    I think they need a hair braider...you [Charlie] think to yourself.    Now, You must need some to yell when your saving the poor World.    Something like "Never fear, Charlies here!!"    But, if you were the REAL Charlie you would probably want to say "I AM HERE TO RID YOU AND YOUR POSSE OF HAIR PROBLEMS!"    Then, you would undergo the most postive aspect of being a superhero, WILD APPLAUSE!!    Now, you must scilence the crowd and get to work- this isn't all fun and games!    Here is your chance to use your newling bestowed gifting.    Be safe! Over confidence is one of Charlies greatest enemys. You may think it's of his own doing but Over Confidence is the name of his enemy.    Here comes the fun part, CREATE YOUR OWN ENEMY!    Charlie chose Over Confidence because it was so ironic. I mean really, Charlie, over confident. Hah!    You may chose something else. Like Evil Spam Man for instance.    Instead of chosing a specail talent for your very own Spam Man, chose one of his weaknesses. Maybe he is fat so he can't fit through small spaces, ya never know.    Now your set!!!! With your super specail talent of hair braiding and your overwhelming knowlede of all your greatest enemys weaknesses YOU CAN SAVE THE WORLD!!!    Have fun kids, and be safe!! [and you thought I was going to make you feed the poor!!]    Love,    laura Fantora
