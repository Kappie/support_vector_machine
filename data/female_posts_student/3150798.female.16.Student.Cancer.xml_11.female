I have youth tonight, permit test tomorrow, work Saturday, church Sunday, my birthday Monday, and then the next Saturday I leave for Young Life camp in Colorado. And I have all kinds of shopping I have to get done for camp.  Mom is taking me shopping Monday for my birthday. I did the same thing last year, just picked out my presents instead of unwrapping them. I guess that is okay, I still have a few  gift s to unwrap from relatives, although most of them give me money. That doesn't bother me, I know I'm hard to shop for. Besides, I get depressed on my birthday and don't like a lot of attention. I don't know why, exactly.   I guess I do, sort of, though. When I was little, I always dreamed about being 16. You know, driving myself to the mall, hanging out with friends. And now I'm 16, and nothing is as I wished it to be. But that's enough of that, I am starting to depress myself, and it's not even my birthday yet,  Anyways, I think I'll feel a lot better when i get back from camp. I'll get to try tons of new stuff and get to know people from my school. So it'll probably help a lot. Not to mention spending some much-needed time away from my family and a great chance to get closer to God, who has seemed more distant these days.
