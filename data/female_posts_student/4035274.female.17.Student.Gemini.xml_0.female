This always vividly strikes me when I'm walking home from the busstop on hot or frigid days when the closer I get to the end of the block the further it seems to travel, as if the houses are multiplying just to spite me. With only three days to go It seems like everyday consists of 48 hours, like every hour is made up of 120 minutes, and each minute is made up of 120 seconds. I'd do the math but I'm going to estimate I just made the day about 16x longer. So now I'm doing stupid things to pass the time like...watching TV. Do you know how much crap is on TV? 600 and some odd channels, and there's only about oneI can stomach. Ah the Space channel, home of Farscape, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Star Trek...but since I've seen every episode of Star Trek there is to see it no longer amuses me. Channel surfing is one of those things that makes time tick more slowly, and yet I find myself doing it anyway. I could...read a book, only I've read four +400 page novels in the past month, I'm going to run out soon. I could write...I  should  write, I mean I want to finish my novella but my muse is taking a small vacation. Ah the sweet computer...hold on, nothing to do here either with Chris off in his own little world and Mandeep off being the social butterfly she is, so it seems only logical that I would simply put down my thoughts on..."paper."    Its only 3:30 pm. I've been awake only4 and 1/2hours, God almighty I need a hobby. Suddenly being so bored I'll go take a nap isn't cutting it anymore, but then again, I only have three days, three lousy days before time speeds up on me. With relatives coming up from Bermuda and Simon coming home there won't be hours in the day to appease everyone or get anything done and before I know it school will be back, but I've never been the kind of person to bitch and complain about going to school, its a welcome diversion from my crazy home life, my crazy love life, my crazy friendships. So I say, bring it on, finally taking subjects I  want  to take, this year should prove interesting at least...(although odds are I'll get Ms. I-have-something-up-my-ass "Good"man for world history) Its sort of unnerving knowing, this is it, my last year of highschool, where have the last three years gone? They were a blink. While I have girlfriends already gearing up for prom as if its the defining point of their lives, I'm thinking "I spent the last three years being a vegitable, and I want to go out in style." Its very much like me to save everything for the last second, if I get the nerve to do it at all. Magazine editor? As if I have the perserverance to do it...Amnesty International? As if I have the compassion...Yearbook photo editor? As if I have the credentials...Softball MVP? Don't even go there, I'm still fuming about last year. All these things I've wanted to accomplish and still have time for friends, for Simon, for homework, for art and softball and just having the time to sit and be me for a second, its a little overwhelming, its a little much considering the past three years have been just a blink. Who has the time anymore?     Oh wait, I do. I have all the time in the world (and I'm justwaiting for it to pass.)
