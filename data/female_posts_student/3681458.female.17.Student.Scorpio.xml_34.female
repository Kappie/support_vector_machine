I think Alex and Asher are going to come over and watch a movie with Emi and I tonight.  Spencer, I think, is out of town... and Nathan is watching The Village as I write.  (what a waste of time.)  I am so worn out.  Last night was really late, and today was long.  I don't know how long I will go on like this.  Not long.  This is silly, but I guess I get butterflies in my stomach now when I think of him...  I haven't felt that in a long time.  Not even with Ben.  I didn't really feel anything with him.  Tyler asks me why I went out with him.  God knows why,  becuase I sure as hell don't.  I was talking to Emi about Ben, and we came to the conclusion that I no longer have those Migraines, nor do I need my anti-depressants.  It must have been him, because now that he's gone I feel 50 times better.   Speaking of which, apparently Jennifer and Mallory came up to work yesterday.  Glad they're "subtle", since my coworkers use the same descriptions about them.  Ha, I know who it is everytime they describe them.  Well, anywho, life awaits.  TTFN
