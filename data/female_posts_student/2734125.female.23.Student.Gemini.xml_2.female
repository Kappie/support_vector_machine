Well, I was already in a community that was required to do this blog thing: I was required to start this for class.  However, I don’t think that having a specific community is what made me so happy to do my blog.  I don’t think that I sat down every time I wrote, which was more then sixty times this semester, and said, “Yeah, now I am doing a class assignment!”  No.  That was not my reaction.  My reaction was more of a, “Oh, I have to write this down now and post it!  Eeep!  I’ve been blogging for forty-five minutes!  I’ve got to go to sleep!”  But why?  What was I finding here that I wasn’t getting other places?  I answered it in my first section of this blog: I found an audience.  Throughout my writing I address my audience, asking them who they are.  When I write in the third person, addressing the audience I have constructed as “you,” I am attempting to build community.  McNeill talks about the confessional text, which I think is an extremely apt metaphor for what is going on in a blog.  McNeill drew her ideas for the confessional text from an article published by Joanna Gill titled, “Someone Else’s Misfortune: The Vicarious Pleasures of the Confessional Text.”  Gill is discussing the ways that the new brand of diaries about dying are especially popular right now.  Popular culture is eating up the story of others who are writing from beyond the grave, knowing that they are dying and signing the book deal before they go.  This kind of text creates a relationship between the reader and the author, one of mutual benefit.  As the reader takes in the final confessions and truths of the author they receive catharsis and a feeling of being able to know a person who is now gone.  The author is given the peace of knowing that they were heard and were able to be possibly forgiven for their life.  McNeill claims that this is even clearer in the online journal, and I would agree with her.  The metaphor of the confessor is brought to life more with the audience’s ability to interact with the online text through comments sections.  The reader is able to give absolution, penance, or just an opinion of what the author has to say.  The reader is participating.  As McNeill says, “The reader of an online diary therefore actively participates in constructing the text the diarist writes- and the identities he or she takes on in the narrative…the confessor stays behind the ‘grille’ of the internet, allowing the diarist- and the reader- the illusion of anonymity necessary for “full” self-exposure” (27).  I wrote about this in one entry (before I did my research and found this fascinating article) saying, “ urlLink Just thinking about what this is, where I am, why these little symbols are coming out... Maybe this is a confessional. Maybe I am confessing to you, to the world, releasing something here. Maybe the internet is a confessional, a receptacle, a containment unit for all the thoughts we wanted to say but didn't, all the things we wish we had thought but couldn't, and all the things that get tangled between that wet fishing line of lies that is life …”    So the audience and the author have a relationship, or create a relationship through the interaction of the text.  This medium offers relationships and the ability to stretch traditional boundaries.  I wouldn’t say the following to just anyone;  “ urlLink If you want a truly painful hospital experience, read Palahniuk out loud in the emergency room. Painful, but somehow lighter then it otherwise could have been. I am reading in a quiet but urgent voice, since that is what the text demands, about a faux suicide hotline. The people call up the main character and he tells them, "go ahead, no there is nothing to live for." It was morbid and ridiculous. I read quieter and thought the whole thing terribly funny. Maybe I'm sick, but it was really very poetic .”   But I said it to my audience, I said it to my confessors, and I liked it.  When I was reading McNeill’s section about confessors and she mentioned the comments section as proof of interaction and I said, “Wait, I put one of those in!”  I was looking for community, a person to hear inner thoughts, and a safe space to express those thoughts.    McNeill states, “…online diarists are acutely aware of their readers, whose desires, expectations, and reading practices shape the texts that bloggers produce” (31-32).  This statement is telling, and in a way true.  I put up the comments section because I wanted to know who my audience is; I wanted to create an understanding of who was reading these random thoughts.  However, I would also claim that audience and author are not as dependent as they appear.  I put up my comments section, and received a few (good, I knew that there were people reading this) but then the comments stopped.  When the comments stopped I was a little disappointed, but it certainly didn’t stop me from writing.  Why?  Well, partly I still knew that my audience was out there by the odd comment that I received in person.  Also, I liked the mere idea of an audience and didn’t really need them constructing my text.  I enjoy the concept that they are out there, taking in something that I put forth, but I don’t need that to have something to say.  For me, the audience is a little bit of a thrill, a power dynamic; they know something about me that may be fairly intimate, and I don’t know who they are.  I could be talking to them about something very innocently, and they could be thinking about my raging post the night before.  This relationship, this telling to others, giving to others, can be fun when it is anonymous.  Who knows who’s listening, right?       But what role do I play in the construction of my audience?  McNeill wrote about a blog that talked about a specific convenience store, and how she felt alienated by this blog; “… I initially dismissed these entries as examples of a banality I thought inherent in the web diary, and was surprised that both diarists attracted contingents of regular readers.  In retrospect, however, I see that I reacted not against the triviality of the diaries, but against their specificity, the very localized textual world these diaries construct” (32).  In this case the authors of the blog are defining their audience through the very localness of their text.  Audiences who read their blogs and know the area that they are in will be immediately drawn in, whereas others, like McNeill will stop reading.  This is a way that other bloggers construct an audience, but I reiterate the question, how do I construct an audience?  I am creating a relationship with my audience in a two fold way; through my word choice I am both constructing the audience that I want, and taking into account the audience that I have and making choices with in that knowledge.  What does that mean?  I am constructing my audience in that however I choose to write, who ever I am addressing my writing too, could become my audience in a blog.  Those that do not feel they are being addressed will likely not read my writing.  How am I meeting my audience?  I am taking into account those who I know I am writing to (My class and my fiends) and directing my meaning and topics .  I am both creating an imaginary ideal audience and working with the real life audience that I know to exist; I am working with both a virtual audience and a real life audience.  When I address my audience I am telling them who they should be, and in writing I am telling them who I think they are: “ urlLink Does what I say confuse you?  Does this speedy rant baffle you?  Then you are not my audience.  My audience are the ones that can listen and know that god and the devil, they came from the same seed, the same moment.  And my audience are the ones who can recognize that maybe, just maybe, birth and death are the same fucking thing, all wrapped up in one convoluted package .”  This excerpt is directly telling my audience who I want them to be, who I am writing for.  However, some of the choices I made were still directed towards the audience I knew to be out there; I could have said “You are not the fucking cunt of a moron that I am writing to,” (this is a sample only…) but I didn’t.  I don’t want to alienate the audience that I know I have, I just want to push their boundaries a little.    McNeill argues that we (bloggers) are attempting to create a community through linking, web chat groups, and such.  I didn’t participate in any of this more advanced blogger community building, but I still feel that I produced a relationship with my readers, and through that relationship a form of community.  By creating a space to confess my own inner thoughts in a safe and semi anonymous space, by letting me create them and respond to them, by the few comments that I received, I have an audience.
