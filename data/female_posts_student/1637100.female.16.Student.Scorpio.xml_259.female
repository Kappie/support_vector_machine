[shpanxx ra-ool, when we gonna get our shirts made?!?!] anyways, after waterfalls, i re-applied my make-up, under ra-ools careful watch [obviously so he could learn how to do it himself.. hehehe] and then i played with and styled ra-ool's and jorge's hair. hehehe. it was fun. after that, chilled a while, and then went up the youth hill for another wholesome message, which i didnt listen to either. just chilled outside with frances, sharayah, ren, jon, terry, shan, jorge ra-ool, davis, and james!! whoa man, james was HYPER!! hilarious!! after that, went to the store and got a new CD and book. yay!! then we went home. wish i coulda stayed at camp =( all my friends.. etc.. oh well. whatever. anyways, today, i think im gonna get some shtufferz accomplished. GRRR. "rachelle, is that all you're gonna do today?" geez. get off my freckin case! its my damn SUMMER!!!! sheesh. for crying out loud................. WHATEVER. IM AN ASS. I HATE LIFE. IT SUCKS.
