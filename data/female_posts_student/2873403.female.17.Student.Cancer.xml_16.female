Friday we had another snow day, so Amy came over that evening as well as my Nick, and Chris-ko (who smelled awesome, which Amy couldn't get over for like 3 days). We decided to make a giant cookie, like we usually do when Nick and Amy and I are all standing around in my kitchen. (Except that one time when we made cupcakes instead and Rob thought we should make one giant cupcake, like we do with the cookie. Think about it. Picture a giant cupcake. Yes that's right ladies and gentleman. Its called a "cake.") Anyway, we decided to make an "Amy's Asshole" themed cookie so they put a big hole in the middle of it, but then when we cooked it, it came out looking like a vagina. So we ate our nice, large, gooey cooter cookie, then I had some mac and cheese which is permanently ruined for me because of the chlamydia. We'll leave it at that. But yeah, so we sort of but not really watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. That was pretty much it, besides the usual trampoline wrestling and some other stuff... ;-) (-: What a good night... (:  Saturday was generally boring but still good, 'cause I'm happy most of the time these days, except where my parents are involved.  Today was also quite boring because I just cleaned all day and then there was this thing... that made me all sad.... but its all good now... I think.
