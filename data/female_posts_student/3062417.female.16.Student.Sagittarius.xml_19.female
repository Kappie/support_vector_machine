There's a destination, for everyone. What's the explanation, when we're done?  All the summer nights spent wondering; So many questions asked, but no one's answering. Would it be okay if I left today? Took my chances on what you said was wrong?  I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret. These years spent, so faded and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.   I'll never regret these years.      Now here i sit, so far away. Remembering all our memories. Its times like these that I miss you most, Remembering when we were so close.    I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, we'll never regret. These years spent, so faded and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.  We'll never forget the places we've been, you and i. Our lives are slipping away. Don't want to let time pass us by, byyyyyyy...  I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret.  These years.... ...spent, so faded and wreckless,  Not sorry, and I'll never regret... I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years. -Jaded (These Years)- Mest featuring Benji Madden of Good Charlotte
