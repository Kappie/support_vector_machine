That was pretty fun and then when I got home I have a big turkey dinner with my family and with Ben and Melissa...well actually yeah they are family.  We had a lot of fun that night and it was good to see my sister again but when they left they left me feeling really upset.  They were talking about high school and university and stuff.  They were both like "University is really difficult compared to High school and oh if I had to go back to high school I would have like 90's" and well that comment scares me and makes me feel really bad about myself.  If I find high school hard now then how will I find university??...If I find high school stressful now then how stressful will University be??  I am trying my best right now but like they said it is suppose to be "so easy."  So then I just cried when I woke up Sunday morning just lying in my bed wishing I were smart, better, wishing everything could be easier and that everything could just work out.  Wondering why I put so much effort into things and get hardly nothing out.  It feels like are my hard work and effort it for nothing right now.  I was even rethinking my future career choice but I am pretty certain I know what I want to do.  As I went over all the possibilities just NONE of them, not one interests me.  There is only ONE thing that I have mentioned over and over yet I just don't know why things are so hard.  I mean I don't seem very good at any of the Sciences or Math which is kind of related to Science and I can't snap my fingers and made me understand or be good at things.  I just cry over and over thinking about the future and what will happen, thinking if I will even get into University because my marks aren't that great now but it isn't like I don't try.  I DO TRY and that is what hurts me all the more is that I FUCKING TRY AND FUCKING try over and over.  And when I never understand or can never get the marks I feel I deserve I cry even more cause it hurts me.  I want SOOOO BAD for my dreams to come true, more than ANYTHING in the world.  Why are some people just nuturally smart and why am I not one of them?  I am sooooo sick of people always saying "do the work and put in the effort than it will pay off" but it NEVER does NEVER and it is so heart breaking just trying and trying but NEVER being able to do anything as good as others.  It hurts me that I am not good at the things I want to be, and I feel like I have never good at anything.  I wish that someone could just tell me right now where I will be in 10 years from now.  I am confused.  Always questioning if this life is worth living and right for me but certain people, hopes, and dreams keep me here for now.  But no one UNDERSTANDS what I feel or what I go through everyweek.  What goes through my head and what it is like being me.  I wish someone could feel what I am feeling and understand whatever I am going through right now.  And today I listened to the rain pour.  Like some kind of calming after affect of what I am feeling and I watched the drops roll down the window and realized that looking outside I feel as if though I am stading outside in the rain and everything is being washed away.  Everything.  I was so upset yesterday that I cancelled my plans with Alex in the morning and I don't really want to be around him or many people cause I just usually have like this attitude where I have no idea where it comes from but people end up hating me because of it.  And well I don't really like Alex at all, I thought I did at once but God what a mistake and besides I don't need for crap to think about or deal with.  I did go to Erics party through and I met Linkin which kinda cheered me up and I was trying to be happy and well thought I was doing a pretty damn good job but then later me and chels were on the couch and she was like "Nessa what's wrong?  You are not yourself and I can tell you are thinking hard about something" and well I felt that it was kinda odd she would notice something wrong cause we hardly even see each other anymore.  But well I just reassured her everything is fine and well she probably thought I was thinkin about Friday and what happed with Alex and Travis and stuff.  but well she is wrong and yeah I guess only I knwo truly about what I am thinking but I don't feel like talking things through with Chelsey at the moment cause she will just tell me it is silly to feel the way I feel and I will get over it.  I have tried to talk to her about things like this before and well this time I think I am just gonna keep things to myself unless someone other than her asks me about everything.  There is just soooo much crap in my life, and yeah a couple good things but the bad thoughts and feelings out weigh the good anyday.  I just hope tommorow I will wake up without crying and feel a little bit better about things.
