Thinking back today about the people I've had crushes on the last couple months...and a good number of them are YPer's...scary and then theres Beau, Bob and...mystery man.  I cleaned my room today, and added a book shelve for all my shit, binders, boxes and assorted pieces of fire hazard.   Cleaned out the closet too...is there another meaning behind this? 'Shady would know.  Anyways... coffee time with a man I love.   and...well...I'm going for sushi on sunday...perfect way to end spring break!  BOO YEAH!
