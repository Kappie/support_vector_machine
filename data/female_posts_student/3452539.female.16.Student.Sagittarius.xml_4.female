The situation sprouting from Stonewall Speakers continues to become more and more absurd and I am very worried about the career/reputation of a certain teacher involved. Today, all-in-all, definitely could have been much better. This morning I at least woke up on time. I still, however, managed to forget to get hocked up on allergy medication before I left the house. Go me.   English - Francoeur was absent so I finished Macbeth to show off on Tuesday,   Contemporary American Issues - went online and read my friend Rob (from Lego Maniacs) astrology section of his website. I must admit that it was pretty funny,   Study - I read  Sense and Sensibility  and am now past the 100 page mark,   Spanish - test, quite possibly the most difficult that I have taken in that course yet and I am pretty worried about the results,   Precalculus - by then most of the school was absent in order to prepare for the senior ball and Panaccione did not feel like doing anything...so we did nothing...except critique a quiz that I barely finished   US History - someone dropped athree of spades out the window and the remainder of the class was spent trying to retrieve it using a paper cup covered in masking tape attached to a paperclip chain and ribbon. It rained a lot today making the card very soggy and very impossible to obtain. Seeing about 95% of my class hanging out a window trying to complete the task was very funny, however.   That was my "academic" day.  Wow, either something is wrong with the pipes in my closet, there is a rather large bee in here, or someone needs to stop snoring. That sound is kind of eerie.   Anyways, tonight was supposed to be a trip to On the Border, a very good Mexican restuarant about 45 minutes away from here with Rob, Jon, Emily, Paul, Lauren, Danielle, and Miranda...however...I received no phone call and come to find out the ride had yet to get everything all set with his car...so therefore it was not happening. And, I did not get my amp.   Instead, Heather, Ashley, Shawn, and I had decided to go play pool at either A's or Mad Maggie's instead of bowling because I really just was not up to it. Well, I walked to Papa Gino's where they were all going to meet up with me and about halfway through my walk I decided that it had been all-together too long since I had last spoken to Tycho so I called - voicemail - okay. Soon enough I got a call back and got myself pretty worked up. We talked for a while and I just chilled on the stone bench in from of the restaurant. He had to go to get on the train :-(  They arrived pretty late, and as soon as they pulled in I saw (and smelled) why. The tender radiator of his precious Honda CRX had blown and the engine was smoking like crazy. They had to call their dad, a cool dude, to come over to help since they live in Agawam and were then in Windsor Locks. He brought water, paper towels, some tools, and...  Drumroll please...  DUCT TAPE!  We ate, got haunted by a stupid game (which I figured out, thank you very much!), and left to go back to Shawn and Heather's house. We ended up just sitting there chatting about the rules of FIRST and watching Happy Gilmore. I missed a portion because I got a phone call, which I was very glad to receive and had decided to step out for a little while where I again managed to work myself up, make a decision, and listen to a bunch of drunken dudes in their backyard.   Now tomorrow, I am going to see about making a little trip. I can actually research it a bit now that I have set my computer back up. Come to find out, the guy that fixed my computer kept my power cord...so I thought that I was screwed until I remembered that I once had a laptop and I took the adaptor from that power cord and it is evidently working fine. Actually, this Windows Millenium could be worse. It is working very well, and very swiftly for me. No complaints yet.   Um, yeah, I have talked a lot and I am sorry if I had gotten you very bored. I shall stop and check up on my trip.  Buenos dias, tardes, and noches todos!  -J9
