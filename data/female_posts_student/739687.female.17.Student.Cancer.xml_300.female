A few issues on my mind. Minor, irrelevant type things that are pathetic excuses for problems...but whatever. They are quite mind-boggling. But I can solves them. Pretty simply too.  So, all in all, I'm still ahead. And I'll never fall behind. I know how to play my cards right, and I have ways of reading people's intentions before they're actually revealed, giving me an overwhelming advantage.   I'm prepared for every battle with full intentions to win the war.   To my competitors in every battle I may be fighting: Have fun losing.  Because, of course, I'm unstoppable.  And then, there are the situations where I simply need miracles. Enough said on that. You know what it's like.  Sometimes it takes more than fighting to get what you want.  Well, See you crazies around. Schedule pick-up today. Etc etc.
