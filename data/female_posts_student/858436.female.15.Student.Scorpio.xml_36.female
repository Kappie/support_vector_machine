We had that A schedule thing y'know, and Mr. G was going psycho! It was a very strange thing. It was pretty funny.  Then at lunch Shannon told Kaci and me the proofs we needed to know for the Geometry quiz. I had those things freaking MEMORIZED! By God, I was going to get those damn proofs RIGHT! It was going to be my first time ever. But... of course we get the quiz that has different proofs! That really made me mad. They weren't very long though so I didn't have to totally BS my way through them.   Mixed Chorus.. GEEZE! My blushing problem is out of control! I had to look Mitch Glueck in the eyes and he kept pointing at his eyes and then at me and I turned RED! I mean RED! I can't help it! I don't mean to! Sometimes I don't even know I am blushing! Geeze Louise. I don't even like him like that, I mean, I hardly know him!  Well, it's midnight and NOBODY is online! What's up with that? That's bizarre.   So now I'm just chilling. I just wanted to stay at home tonight and get over this gay week. It was seriously just stupid. Tonight is nice, Virginia AND Charles are both spending the night out with friends so I'm an only child! I came home and nobody was home so I called my mom's cell and she was over at Ginger's house and then they went to dinner or something and then my dad got home around 4:00. And of course he didn't want to cook so we called Yang's and got some food, so I got to sit in front of the TV watching "The Real World" and eat Chinese food. Quite nice. Then I CLEANED my room! Whoa! Haha. I had all these plastic boxes under my bed with all this crap in them and I threw a bunch of it away, so now I'm down to 1 box of junk, my horse show scrapbook box, and then another box that I keep all of my notes in. Haha I'm such a packrat. But I got rid of 2 big boxes so I'm proud of myself.   Hm.. well if you wanna do something tomorrow call me! Because I want to do something! And... if you're reading this and don't know my number it's 471-4524 and the cell is 258-0934. Haha that was gay but I felt like saying that. Night!
