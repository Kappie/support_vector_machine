There's just so much, and because of that, I can't even focus on one thing. There's just too much.  I know what I want out of life, that I can't have. I think I am an Emotionally Homeless person. Im sitting on the edge of your sidewalk, and my can is out, and that's the farthest I've gotten, because I don't even have a house to call you from.  The greatest prize in life is love, but whats to do when you have no absolution of it? I couldnt belive in love. If someone paid me a million dollars, I wouldnt.  "It's a known fact, when two opposites come together, it always ends in heartache." The sad thing is, most experiance heartache before there even together. But you couldnt tell that person, because most likley your trying to cover-up the fact you have feelings for that person. And you get upset if the person does something, or acts a certian way but they can't help it, because they have no clue as to what their doing wrong.  I wish we were all dead to the emotion of love, like robots. That would just make life easier to get thru, so of coarse that would never happen.  "Cause I'd never do something intentionally just hurt you And I've stared at the sky and I've asked myself why you've become like an angel to me"    ~Allister Pain isn't planned, because it's always there. Never goes away, Never show remorse. It's like a ugly scar from a long time ago. Even the best neosporin can't take this away. I know my ramblings don't leave you to much of a plot line, but it's 10:00 in the morning, and I just cant take much more of this.
