Well I actually know why! Its all because I was a kleptomaniac was going insane. Then one day my friends set me up and I got caught stealing and here I am telling you my story...   Dear Diary, Today I went to my shrink and she asked me personal questions about my family and friends. People also came to my house and said that if I'm caught stealing, lying, etc., that I'll go to a mental hospital. I don't want to go away so I guess I have to behave. I might want tostart talking to my shrink...  						Lisa  	So I started to talk!   	"Lisa, did you ever steal anything big? Like a tv or stereo?" 	I answered her plain and simple, “No.” 	So she wrote something down and then looked at me, "Then what did you steal?" 	I looked at her dumbly and said, "don't you know how to read? I know they give you my records and shit so stop the bullshit and just get over yourself, now is this all your going to ask me because if so I have better places to be!” 	 Now that was a mistake because what I didn't know was she was writing down every little thing I said. I hated this I could get into really big trouble for what I said to her ...but I couldn't think about it , that’s the worst that could happen I needed to think more positive! So the next day my mom says that I should get a job. She says it would make it easier for me not to steal. Well with my school records and police records no ones going to hire me!!  	I walk into the office were Alex works!  	“Lisa Hadley, last call for Lisa Hadley." Says Alex's secretary.  	“Yes?” I say as nicely as I can. 	Follow me." I follow her down a hall to a new office. "From now on Alex and you will meet in here. Sit and touch nothing I know all about you." 	I give her a glare and sit down. I play my game boy for 20 to 25 minutes before Alexander comes in.  	"Lisa how are you?" She asks soft and friendly.  	"I don't know doc, how am I?" I say with a little smirk.  	My shrink doesn't know how to respond to this and sits for a moment and thinks.  	“"Lisa how bout we talk about your family today?"  	I look at her then I say calmly, “What would you like to know?” 	She thinks hard and then answers me, "Are your real parents still together or divorced?"  	"Divorced, “I answer coldly.  	"Ok," She pauses and wipes of the sweat on her forehead. "Do you remember it?"  	"NO! I was only 4, did you forget to read the papers they gave you about me again or do you just not care?" I ask with a very harsh voice.  	"Ok new subject. Oh Lisa, lets just ask the question that’s been one both our minds this whole time. What’s wrong? What’s bothering you? Would you say you were ever traumatized as a child?" She asks with a different tone in her voice. 	"Let me think...well there was this one time that...never mind." I look at her and I know this is going to turn out bad.  	"ONE TIME THAT WHAT?" She asks with excitement and force.  	I say what I want and don't think first, "Your not my mother, your not my friend, your a stupid bitch that just wants to run my life and I won't let you! I don't need you or any one else to figure me out so get the hell out of my life."  	"Lisa I'm only trying to help you calm down!" She says with fear in her eyes.  	"Shut the hell up I don't need this anymore." I got up and walked out of the room, I just couldn't take it any more. Even though I knew I was in some BIG trouble.   	That day I went home to my mom on the couch sobbing and three very big men in suites that looked like they should be in the movie Men in Black. "Mom what’s happening, what’s wrong, what’s going on?" I ask her as I sit next to her to hold her.  	Her voice is cracked and dry. In between sobs she says, "Their...taking...you away!”
