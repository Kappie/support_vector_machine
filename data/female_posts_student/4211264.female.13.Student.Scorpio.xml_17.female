Anyway, I ate breakfast, what consisted of  milk , and  lucky charms . Delicious. Then I just wasted my poor 13-year-old life, watching TV. Later I hung out with my cousin who was over, which was fun until my "little" sister, Hannah Banana came and stole my cousin away from me. I was sad, so I took a shower, because it was a 95 degree day. The shower was amazingly refreshing. I came out, and tied my hair in a bun so it would hopefully be curly in the morning, which always looks good. Then I wasted my day some more, and went on the computer for a few hours. When I got bored, I decided to take advantage of the weather and go tanning. It didn't work because I was lieing down on my front side, and when I thought that side was fully baked, I turned around and the sun was beating death rays into my eyes, so now I have one nice tan side, and one "pale" side. But don't worry, I won't get skin cancer, because I put on sunscreen! Bleck, it smells bad. Anyway, I have to go now, I think it might just be my bed time! Goodnight.       -Sierra
