IT WAS THE WRONG FUCKIN' ROLL!!!   i asked for double exposures and i thought it wa only 24 exposures. nevermind me thinking i had the right roll of film. i could not be more pissed. i wasted my fucking money on stupid pictures from christmas!  stupid motherfucking god! i hate you! again, why do you hate me so much?!?!?!?! first, you make me fat, and then you make me grab the wrong roll of film!!!  goddammit. i fuckin gypped myself.  god i am ever so pissed!!!!  AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!! i hate you jesus! you fuckin shitface!!!!  damn. let it out. let it all out.  i blame the rain. the rain and jesus. fuckin hippie. think you're so cool with your robe and birkenstocks (no offense to birks), and your stupid wannabe Eric Clapton facial hair. nobody likes you. you suck.  YOU ARE NOT MY HOMEBOY.  no matter what the t-shirt says.  im gonna go have fun now.   i saw The Ring for the first time tonight and it scared me something bad. after the movie was over, we went up and hung out in ceilidh's room and called ppl and said, "7 days..." just like the movie. and then when we were done, her TV buzzed like it was about to turn on. it was off...or so we thought. it was so scary. we ran out into the hall screaming and then we all collapsed on top of one another laughing and practically wet ourselves. then will walks in and just looks at us then keeps walking. yeah. we deserved that. it was pretty creepy though.  if you've seen the ring, you would understand how scary it is when TV's just turn on by themsleves.  or even buzz like they're about to. yeah.  damn that was scary    i smell hella good.
