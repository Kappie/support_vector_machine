(for anyone who's never seen the damn show, the idea is the contestants provide the questions for the answers which they're given. the questions are statements and the answers have to be formed as a question. wow. that explanation makes the show more complicated. hm.)    when there was an 'answer' about brigham young, he let us know that we was an alum of BYU and that's why he knows what the 'question' is.   yeah thanks ken. this isn't 'who wants to be a millionaire' where that kind of behaviour is encouraged. we just want your question. give us the information and let us move on to the next category.   he says things in funny voices. there was a category today with the word "mexico" in it. and when he chose that category, he uses this fake mexican accent to pronounce the word. this bothers me. (it actually bothers me in most situations, not just ken's)   but. the  other  contestants are great. i actually saw a woman enter (roughly) "whatever ken wrote for his answer" in final jeopardy. she wagered the minimum bet.. and since no one could read her answer - bad handwriting - she had to read it outloud.. and it was in the most cynical voice.. she smirked.. it was great..   a day or so later another woman wrote "I want my two dollars!" for her final jeopardy answer. now. alex didn't get it. i don't think ken got it. and if you don't get it. watch    urlLink   Better Off Dead   . the paperboy from hell. this made my day. possibly my favourite moment on jeopardy. a reference to a john cusack 80's movie. you can't get much better than that.   but. he still bothers me.   that's where you'll find me now.   watching too much television.
