Another lazy summer day is going by.  Each one, is pretty much like the last.     Pretty White Kids With Problems.  Have you heard of it?  It's a new show on TV.  Well, not really.  I was flipping channels, and it was on Comedy Central.  I think it was probably something to do with MadTV, but I'm not completely sure.  It was one of those spoofs, this one in particular making fun of all the shows like The OC and Northshore (that's the new one coming soon).  There was one adult with a bald spot, wandering around school, claiming to be "the same age as everyone else."  Jokes including such words about 'black' things, and the usual, "No offense, D.J." called to the one black kid, were also in the show.  There was even a theme song.     Just recently, when I got home from school.  I found a bird, lying on the sidewalk right near my door.  I wasn't sure if it was dead, possessed, or what.  Once inside, I went to tell my mom.  Apparently, the dumb bird had flown into our front door.  My mom hadn't gone to see it yet, but she had heard a loud thump.  Luckily, the bird only seemed to be a little dazed.  After we poked it, the bird went hopping on it's way.  It was a freaky experience though.  One I probably won't forget anytime soon.  I've never seen a bird act in that way.
