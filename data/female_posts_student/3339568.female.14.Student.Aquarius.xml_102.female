And what an amazing sermon. It was funy, yet still related to me today. I thought it was great. :D 'Snaps 4 Tom' And we stayed in our PJ's ALL day! :D Eh'xcelent! And then Mel and I spent basically the rest of the day being musos, and get this - we wrote our own song on the guitar!! I'm so excited. I've always wanted 2 write one, but I never thought I would be able to. Though thanks to God we could. We read his word, and prayed 4 his help and inspiration a few time, combined our limited knowledge together (i've been playing guitar 4 5 days, and mel 4 bout a month or so) and voila, we have a song!! It's called "Soul of the Earth" and i love it sooo mcuh! I would love it to be played in Church one day. That wouldbe truly awesome. Mi life is pretty much perfect now (and yes it's more than the one obvious reason that alll of your gossip queens are thinking) except for one thing. I tried my hardest to reconcile, but she didn't want to. It's very sad. She was one of my really good friends. I don't know what happened. It almost doesn't seem fair. :( But I tried, and I will forgive, and I hope she will forgive me for whatever "horrible" thing I did to her that I have no idea of. Time will tell, and it heals all wounds. But on a kind of good note, I now know who anonymous is, thanks to Luke's computer detective skills. 'Snaps 4 Luke' So yeh, mi day in a blog. Bi Bi all. Luv ya Beth
