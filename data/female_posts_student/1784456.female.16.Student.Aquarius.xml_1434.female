(It's only with people who are smelly) Nah, I just ignore them! *hah take that!* But then I also ignore people that I like... I don't want people to have that bigger influence over me. *plus all the people I like don't like me* and I get confused. Which I'm trying to do to you now! MUHAHAHAAA! Look left! To your foot! *why does feet always come into it?* I hate looking at people and thinking 'why are they alone?' cause everyone's so great! *hypocrite* No one should be alone. *that's why i annoy people so much, cause i don't like leaving people alone* Ah yes, this is why I'm alone! *oh well* Scary huh? I'll just be crawling away and coming back wearing a french wig under a different alias! Bye!  Bonjour. Vous avez un poisson?!?!?!!!  ... Maybe not ...
