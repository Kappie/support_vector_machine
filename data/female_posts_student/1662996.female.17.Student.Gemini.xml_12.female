I suggest you all take a trip there and get the chicken fajitas!  Then we came back to my house and took some crazy gangsta pictures on my web cam. If I can figure it out, I'll put some pics on here.   Jaimo got her hair cut. dear lord its the cutest thing I ever did see. She looks adorable! damn skippy, Jaimo! I think it makes her look more like Ozzy (her cat... not the washed out rocker)   I went to the doc today. I have to take allergy medicine now hence the spring attacks my system with pollen and blooming trees. gr.   night all   ::kuffly wuffly::
