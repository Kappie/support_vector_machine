Y.S. can say that i'm a good gf to you cos i'm brave to fight for my love but i feel that when she say this to you, she is trying to make you feel happy.. that what i feel in my place as a gf.. cause she is my enemy.. i'm childish... but that me.. i'm 17... ya.. i can be mature sometime as you said.. but at times, i will still go back to my old self, my age.. sorry.. i love you.. that why i possessive... if i dun love you, why would i care so much.. that kind of kpo to know who you with and will not stop you from been close with them de.. maybe i really need to be more understanding.. to stand at your view to interpret thing.. i will try to learn to be.. hopefully, one days, we can be the happiest couple.. Love You Dear JER..
