Today I took my LSAT - results should be emailed on July 6, so we'll have to wait until then to find out how expensive of a bottle of champagne I need to buy.  Thought it went great. Remains to be seen. Sentences short because me very hungry. Me not eat all day.  I'll post more when I'm more coherent and actually have time to surf the web again for interesting tidbits.
