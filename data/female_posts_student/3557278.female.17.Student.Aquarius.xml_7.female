Take example, my brother... ok maybe not :P  Anyway, the example i was going to give was my neighbour. (Ooops sorry if you are reading this somehow.) Anyway as you probably know i went on the bronze hike this year to help out, and get my community servive hours up. Most of the year 9s were a pretty cool bunch once we got out there (very different to us back then, though). But i was helping *someone* do her log book and it said:    ...then went to sit down under neath a blue tarp that the teachers had set up for us.... we all sat around and listened to the teachers give us lectures on safty and lots of boring things to do with bush craft...no offence but it was boring.After that exciting 2 hours .....took some photos we all headed back into camp where we got another boring lecture on bush craft.   how  rude ! I'm sure the teacher who is  giving up their time marking  that is going to appreciate having their effort/time being called 'boring'. ugh! They need to know that stuff before they go into the bush anyways... if you don't want to pay attention then be my guest and get lost! oh yeh and he msn name is like "im a bitch... ill kick ur ass" or some shit.  haha i'm really sorry if you read this. you probably thnk i'm a bitch if ur reading it.  I shouldn't be so harsh though. The rest of the group was pretty kool. hehe they gave us a really nice thankyou note.  toodles  PS: i finished my SAC assessment, yay.
