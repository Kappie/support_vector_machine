I'm trying to figure out what to put there. There was a picture there, but it was, um, "not me"...  I'm considering putting a picture of a slope and a lift at  urlLink Whitetail  for the time being, but it's been a while since I have done anything with pictures and HTML...  I'm too tired to make any attempts right now, but maybe later... ..Maybe...  Wow, three posts in one night. Go Ash.....
