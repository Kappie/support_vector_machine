He is a democrat of course and is going to help our great city.  He wouldnt have to do much to live up to Joe Barton.  God i truely hate that guy.  I went to the parade, i was like "back stage" and met this guy.  I wanted to just spit on him or something because he acted all damn high and mighty.  That man is ruining our great city.  I am just glad to be doing something about it instead of just whinning.  Anyway so ive been up at the office a lot working long hours. I realized i work harder for that man than i ever would for the texas rangers who pay me.  How does that work? i dunno.  anyway im thinking a recommendation from a congressman will look better on my college application than from some guy who works at six flags.  but then again, i may be wrong.  anywho i met this guy joe who works at this QuikTrip really close to my house.  His name is Joe K.  He is 20 years old going to UTA and even though he is just some smartass college student, he knows a fucking lot about what the hell is going on in this world.  He is republican but unlike gavin, he can stand behind what he believes with hard solid facts and some really good points.  This guy is a total nerd, he hasnt even seen a movie in like a year, but he does know what the hell he is talking about. if only he were younger and not catholic. okay  so maybe i didnt get to go to england but in these past like two weeks.  i have learned so much from whats around me, i really am happy i didnt get to go.  Oh but the best part is that a couple of days a ago i got my 1991 Buick Regal out of the shop. they didnt paint it like they said they would and a lot of it is still messed up. like i have no freon for my air conditioner, break pads are shot, radio/tape player is messed up, oh and so are the locks and the sun roof.  wow my car is really already falling apart. but at least i still have my Morris Meyer for US Congress bumper sticker.  other wise it would just be crappy.  anywho my time at this internet cafe is running out so i gots to be out for now but hopefully i ll be seeing some of my friends from oak very soon. i havent seen anyone in a couple of weeks and im getting a little sad.  bye
