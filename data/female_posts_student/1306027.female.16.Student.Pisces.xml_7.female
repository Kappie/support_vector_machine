Just the thought of 3 weeks in a dorm with people like stephanie (hahahaha) gets me on a happy streak again. Plus- im decked out this year. Im'a have people thinking im rich- hahahahaha. No really tho- Im middle middle class. To quote a song "Ya'll just dont know what its like, to be female, middle class, and white." actually the song had 'male' but that would sound a bit strange as a comparison ya know?  Today comes more  packing . Joy. I can't say that I enjoy packing but hey, I'm leavin in 2 days so what does it matter?  Speaking of packing- i think I'll go do some.
