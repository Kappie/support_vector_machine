The idea of search through thousands of colleges so that I can pay an outrageous amount of money that I don't have , is for some reason completely unappealing to me.   Having spent a full 3 hours straight hours looking through countless college profiles I have come to one undeniable fact, looking for colleges SUCKS! Now I would not normally reduce my self to using such uneducated words to describe how I feel, except that I don't think any other word can accurately describe my thoughts on higher education right now. For your sake, however, I will try.   My endeavor of finding a suitable college , has filled me with despair the likes of which was not been seen before on the face of this earth, or as far as I can tell, any other world that might exist. The task of discerning the perfect school, that can I can afford, and have a chance to get into, from 4000 colleges, is something that no human, or beast for that matter, should be faced with.   I have to stop now, I am getting even more depressed.   -Driel
