Then I did the whole Mother's Day thing.  Got her stuff, made breakfast and dinner.  It was a nice weekend, and now I have to stress out again for this coming week.   "So much time so little to do, no wait, scratch that, reverse it" willy wonka And unfortunatley I won't be here for the fun day this weekend, I have to go see my Grandfather graduate with his Dr.  Yay Grandpa!
