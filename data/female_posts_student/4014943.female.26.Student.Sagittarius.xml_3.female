Tommorrow i am going for an hour run i am really going to get back into my groove. Shawn and i had a talk and things are cool.Mckayla is making me so proud she is doing absoulutley amazing in her swimming lessons. She isn't my baby girl anymore:(. I am going to hangout with shawns parents today so mckayla can have some papa time (shawns dad) she adores his family and i am glad she needs a functioning family around her. I am still having crazy dreams not sure what they are about but i hav eread you dream what you fear most..... that is kinda scary. I am waiting for a book to be released i am stocked about it jenna jamison. The tracy lords book was awsome.  I still really want to make my own porn magazine. We will see i am just waiting to get some cash for my tattoo and my mini disc player. I hate debt it suxs ass. I am also starting weights again tmw. i had a personal trainer make out a workout plan and then in a month change everything up... lets see if this works. I am still amazed that shawn is such a great guy. It felt really good that he knew i could pass my course only thing is when i actually hear praise and compliments it is really hard to hea them it is like my brain blocks them out because for so long in my life i was told how stupid and ugly and lazy i was. I guess it kinda wears on you.Oh well again. I am getting extremly worried about my cat though she has an eating disorder as well she emotinally eats and is becoming more overweight it has gotten worse since i had started school. I pray she doesn't become diabetic my mom had a cat that sick and i would hate to give my bubby (real name patches) needles everyday. I am amzed what one workout is doig for my sanity already. Just wiat i willbe all horny next week cause my drive will be insanly crazy again....grrreeeeaaaattt. I thin i need to buy a fuckin dildo. poor shawn. i might post pictures soon;). but the countdown still stands. Today i am proud and happy of myself i feel good just flabby it is abeautiful thing:P.
