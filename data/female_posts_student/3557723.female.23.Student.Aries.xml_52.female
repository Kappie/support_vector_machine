I can't do it tomorrow since it's full on with lectures and a four hour lab.  I'm looking forward to the lab. I'm analysing the caffeine content in tea, coffee, decaf coffee, and a sample of a drink of my own choice. My choice is Chocolate Mint Tea, something that had the lab technician wearing the "Oh, you're one of those students..." look on his face. :P
