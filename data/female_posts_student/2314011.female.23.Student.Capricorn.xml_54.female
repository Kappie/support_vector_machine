Pretty damn normal, actually.  But they weren't spent in front of the TV for once (then twice!) and that's big.    It hit me a couple of weeks into January that I had yet to make a New Year's resolution.  Had such a great one last January, what with all the excitement and joy of exploring and adventuring, that this year's was forgotten in the nostalgia.  So, it came to me one morning at the kitchen table with morning pages: I decided to be more proactive.  Learned last year to pay attention, listen and breathe; this year it's time to start using those lessons.  Don't yet know how precisely, but I'm sure it'll come to me.    So yea, had a good night out.  This week kicked my ass, so a big damn bunch of queers dancing to Top 40 remixes sounded perfect.  The homework will be light, too, and we have to take advantage of that.  The show was good; the first one after a dry spell always feels great.  It was Kathy's birthday celebration, so every song performed was from the 80s or before.  So great.  Peggy Lee.  Dusty Springfield.  The new remix of the Laverne  Shirley theme-song.    Was on my own for the second show, and was buzzed just enough to continue dancing by myself in the sea of young things.  Yay.  Tried to track down the birthday girl to thank her properly for the free entrance fee, and ended up people-watching with the Voice of God.  She's a barrel of laughs, wields a mean screwdriver and makes for a great DJ.  Pink is right!  Eventually, Kathy took me into her big office and we enjoyed a sensitive chat on her couch about toilet gaskets and the asshole-tax for Frat boys.    Today's been spent pretty much entirely on the futon, the day's single outing being a journey across the state line for The Butterfly Effect.  I really enjoy the preview.  Wish they'd just stuck with that.  It's one of those rare movies that's bad in the first 10 minutes and never improves.  People actually screamed a few times, and I laughed out loud a few more.  Demi was behind the whole thing.  It reeks of her.  So glad I get to see Lost in Translation tomorrow.    But for tonight, I think I'll get cozy with a new comic and a new novel.
