I am reall y excited for New Edition.They're getting back into the mix.The song is not my favorite,but it's pretty good.Some of those kind of groups don't really do good when they come back after a long time.But I think from hearing this song,that they have some potential.  Lo-Key-I got a thang 4 ya.Another one of those old songs.I heard it on the Adelphia cable R&B channel.Yeah,its old,but it's good.
