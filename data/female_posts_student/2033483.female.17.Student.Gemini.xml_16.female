Moment that pops out in my head first is when Erica and I were talking in the JLab today and I was sitting in "well yeah's" seat and he came in and I said I was sorry for sitting in his seat and he said oh no you're fine and looked at me with those beautiful eyes...awww I just about melt.  Take that AJ!  Although I must admit that when I ever I'm around him I find it hard to form words...this could be bad.  Then we started an algebra test that was simple and the physics test was simple too, so now watch I'll get them both back and get a horrible score on both.  Life has a way of screwing you like that.  I finished my lit and comp essay and I pulled this one out of my butt so I will hopefully get a good grade on this one too.  Lunch was Lunch.  Chemistry was Chemistry.  Had an interesting Republican/Democrat debate in AP history with Brett Peterson.  I felt a bit bad cuz it was him (Republican) against Sindju, Reily and I (the Democrats)  If you've met me you know I'm a huge Democrat.  But it was all in fun.  I saw Stanley driving on my way home (rolls eyes)(and I'm almost positive that the girl with him was Holman....cues Renae to make the face and say the name) I find this kid annoying.  Dare I say more annoying then McPotty?  oh hell, yea!  I still have history notes to do....(thinks about the hours of work ahead of me) ...well,  ~tata
