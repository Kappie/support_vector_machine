It's noted that a high percentage of the early comic book artists were Jewish (Stan Lee, for example was born Stan Lieber). "Quite a few of them disguised themselves -- that's what you did to get your foot in the door," Brevoort said, adding that the creations of these closeted Jews were, quite often, disguised personal stories.   Well, these Jews have been "outed" now. Actually, they were "outed" a few years ago. I just happened to run across this little piece of information today. I guess that just goes to show how comic book savvy I am. heh.
