(i'm assuming mike thurston would like to be included in the band name somehow, and unless he wants to get an operation,ADD girls just doesn't fit him in somehow.) beth i know you will like this one. or it could just be jeepers creepers - but anyway, coolest band name ever.   so who's still gone again?
