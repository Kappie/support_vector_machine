     
      Lest in my reverie I did not understand Imaginable facts I didn’t see In life I see nothing but thee You make my world go round As far as I can be Inspiring who I am That is who you are to me A blessing from Almighty That’s why I thank thee Now I understand Latter did I see The impossible joy You bring to me
