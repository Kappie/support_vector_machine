Story: found a funny hat at goodwill, a long black skirt...sanitized them both, and voila! Mary Poppins.  Well my original idea was Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady...but...  Anyway...andrew and i won the costume contest thingy (he was mr. bean) ...we got a bean bag chair thingy. also we had the goriest pumpkin :-P it was cool. it had guts coming out of its mouth and eye and top of its head. haha.  Problem: there was only one (chair, that is) :-P  Pictures are on the way as soon as they develop and i finish using my roll of film :-P (wait...other way around)  i realize i talk too much.
