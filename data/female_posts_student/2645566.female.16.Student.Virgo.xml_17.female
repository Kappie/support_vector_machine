Anyway....before dinner I have to make an appearance at the Wright's house because Daddy Wright is expecting Paul and I to come for pictures. Then we will *hopefully* get picked up in the limo and go to The Butler's Pantry for dinner (we are getting a GREAT deal on that!). After that I suppose we will go to the dance out at UTSI. Nice little drive..but I don't mind as long as we have that limo. hehe. But even if we don't, it's all gravy. I don't know what we will do afterwards....hopefully Tori will ask her mom...but if not, oh well.
