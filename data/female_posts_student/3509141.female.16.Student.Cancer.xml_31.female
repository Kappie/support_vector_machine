What I do all day and all night is play computer and video games... Boredom all the way. :(. And none of my friends want to play with me :(. It's so  sad  :(.  So, anyones. I have a  temperory solution  :). I made a new blog. It's a  role-playing blog . I dunno what exactly I'm gonna do with it yet. But prolly it's gonna be where everyone makes up a role and plays it. I'll prolly make it loose role-play, i.e. peeps r allowed to change roles, small out-of-role moments allowed, etc. We'll c how that works out. Anyways, stay tuned :).  Btw, u can access the role-playing blog at http://rphaven.blogspot.com
