Sorry to everyone who voted on my poll about the rugby I changed the setting of my template and I accidentally deleted the poll. Oops, but I made another one, so you can still vote.    I am not at school today, because I am sick, I've only had about 1 cold this winter which is unusual because I am usually sick all winter. I still can't believe I got into Maccy.
