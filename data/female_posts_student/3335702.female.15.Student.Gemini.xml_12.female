I just don't have any motovation except music. I'm not going to get this Algebra done and I'll have to be put back into College Prep 2. I need to get up and do something with myself. You know what, fuck that. I'm going to sit in the car for 4 hours tomorrow. I'll do it then, I'll tattoo it on myself, I will get it done. But while I'm here, and at home. I'm going to do what I want. I don't give a fuck about school work. I have school work to do when school starts. This is summer, I am going to party. If you have a problem with that...change your attitude. I didn't get to go to Warped Tour...So I have an excuse for being so mad. My mom is starting to nag, what did we do to her, she's an adult, she volunteered to have children, this shit is that womans job too. I'm grounded, I haven't seen other people besides my family in about...a week. They cannot expect me to be happy. Alright Leela you little Bitch, Shower. Now.
