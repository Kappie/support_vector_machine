First and foremost, she is my girlfriend :p  And I love her very much :) And nothing will ever change that!  But I also did want to say one thing, just so that everybody knows, she is afraid of worms :p  Ok, maybe scared isn't the correct term.  I will just say this... She can jump six feet in the air, even if she does deny it :p  There is a whole little story to that, but I am not going to start explaining that now.. I have to get some sleep :)  Its 2:22 am, and I want to go to sleep so that I can have wonderful dreams :)
