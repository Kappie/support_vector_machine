I hate it and was dirty and sticky all over. I stayed until 12am plus for the countdown and rushed all the way back to the MRT station. Man, I felt sad for all those cleaners out there. They have to clean up the mess after all the celebration.... I ReAlLy HaTe It! Oh yeah, thanks to the stupid necklace I was wearing, now I got rashes all over my neck.... Urrgghh.... Itchy!
