Here is when things get insulting and when i get defensive.  -HOW WILL MEN RESPECT YOU IF YOU DON'T RESPECT YOURSELF? True, true. But then, sometimes, guys are just really disrespectful regardless of how respectable we girls are.  -WOMEN ARE EASY TO GET AND EASY TO LET GO OF. I feel harsh winds from this one... if yknow what i mean!  -BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF EVERY MAN IS A WOMAN. AND BEHIND THE FAILURE OF EVERY MAN IS ALSO A WOMAN. It sounds great at first then ching! Nowhere near great! Ano?! Suntukan nalang?!!  -WOMEN ARE EMOTIONAL. THEREFORE, MEN ARE INTELLECTUAL. Stop me. Somebody please, stop me!  I know, I know. These are all very minimal but come on! Anyway, the lecture was Ok naman. Believe me, this isn't as contradictive as it seems.
