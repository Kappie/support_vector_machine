That was fun :) We .....hung out...downstairs for a bit, then went out for dinner..The Hurricane Grill was closed though, so we went and got a pizza, ate it in Centennial. Went to "our spot" in the woods there, and talked for a bit.. I love him so much, he's just so....perfect. It's so amazing. I love being with him..I wish I lived closer, like walking distance from everyone (and appropriate, like, 5 minute walking distance, none of this 60 minute junk) and then I could see everyone..:( Man, I miss him.   Watched Ayla today, got her to eat a salad. Very very major moment here, because I didn't have to choke it down her throat!! She ate it voluntarily! Yaaaaay!!! And tomorw night I get to make chicken fingers and....SALAD!!! Hopefully she'll eat that too, and so hungrily like she did today :)  Other than that, not much new...Nick was wearing a necklace thingy today.......crap he looked so hot, I can't get over it :P And Tom expressed how much he wanted to go to Edmonton and CUC now, and I said he still could...people ARE still sending in their registrations, its just that his airfare would be killer....MAN I hope Mike says he can go!!!!! *crosses fingers* That would be so radical, ooh man... Anyways....till another, friends.
