She's agreed to help me ! She asked about my dancing too.   I'm really very happy  . (",)  Tomorrow's  Brenda 's birthday, and we've set up a  surprise  for her. We're going to  pretend  to forget that it's her birthday, and then surprise her after school. Hope that she'll like it.  Ms Lem 's going to help us keep the stuff first. (",)  Hmm.. I think that's all for today. Can't think of anything else to write down anymore. Perhaps I'm too happy. Oh yeah! Portugal lost to Greece in the Euros 2004. Boo!! Too bad. The score was 0-1. They just weren't on form yesterday night.  -"Love someone with all your heart"  *Listening to   [Candle in the Wind]   by  Sir Elton John     urlLink
