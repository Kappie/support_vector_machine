I guess about 15-20 mins later, I started feeling a bit... different... my stomach was turning a bit....  I'm now deciding what I can take... Pepto Bismol... ACK... I hate liquid meds... Anyhow... on the upside...  urlLink Catch Me If You Can  was a very good movie... I highly recommend it... when we got there we saw Druck, Ceci, Alex, Christine, Ceci's lil bro and sis (Tori and Vincent) and we saw Sean and Krystle... wow... it was like a drumline reunion for a bit...  Anyhow... Now I will go call Ricky back... and yell at him for making me think I'm sick too!  >P       urlLink  postCount('2Jan2003');
