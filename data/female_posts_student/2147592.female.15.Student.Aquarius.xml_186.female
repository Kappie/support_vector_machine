The ride up was lame, and teh whole day was. I had to catch up on loads of stuff. I joined Lisa loads of times, and met this guy called John, he's going to her eighteenth, and I can't wait! Well yeah, the day soon drew to an end (thank God) and I'm now over Pig's, after drawing lots of random shat, I have improved, and "on a roll" as they say, I just keep thinking of Helen's sketchbooks and I just want to be her! Her drawings are so beautiful, and mine are just lame :|. Well thats all... Toodlepipx
