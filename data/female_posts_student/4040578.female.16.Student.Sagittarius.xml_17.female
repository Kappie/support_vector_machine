Mom disagreed and wanted to head north so the temperatures wouldn't be so hot. Me, well I agreed to stay home or travel north also. So, we thought well why don't Leah and dad go on a vacation and then mom and I could. Well, probably is, dad is the money man. So yeah, they left and headed who knows where and will return who knows when. Just know that they have to return by Monday cause Leah works. Mom and I would love to go on vacation together up north, but dad just left us some money and then the car might be an issue on traveling. I just find it weird but yet nice. So yeah, tonight and all weekend mom and I will bond..hehe! I love my mommy!      Moving on, today was yet another nice day. Woke up before noon. I did lounge around most of the day, dusted my room, and watched has half of the family left. My brother John's ex-girlfriend visited today and she told me about this cool place where she gets her hair cut. So tomorrow, I am off to get this long stuff growing on my head cut off. Yay me! After Leah and my dad left I took the trash out and took a shower so that my mom and I could go look at a desk. We went and saw the desk, it was nothing special so we left and went to Meijer. At Meijer we got our fluffly lil fur balls some food, picked us up some yumilicious Jones Sodas and were on our way home. While at home, we realized that Gretchy Sketch was outside meowing its head off. So my mom goes out to feed him, when she realizes it's not Gretch its poor precious lovable ROMY! Aw, my baby got out of the house (most likely from being in Leah's room when her screen fell out of the window). She was out the whole time we were running errands. She could have been kitty litter, but luckily she stayed out of the street and just sat on the back porch. After that incident, I watched some tv. My television watching is over so that is why I am here. I have had alot to think about today. Some good thoughts, some bad. Life can get pretty crazy. I find I have alot to work on. I am on a mission. A mission which I am going to succeed in. But yeah, today was just another day, kinda sorta...hehe!      Ok, now you get the picture that my family must be a bit different. Sure we have the issues like most families have, but they just left to go on vacation. But why am I complaining? I love it, I really do...just as long as they are safe. Well, nothing more for me to say here, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background: Are You Happy Now?-Michelle Branch
