But I kinda resisted and got some pizza and an apple for lunch which I guess is not too bad when I think about it, that is not too junky or calorie loaded.  I am not too sure how the Chem test went cause somethings I really knew and other things I wasn't too sure and could not remember but I really need a good mark in that stuff.  And well since today was Wednesday and there are no Science tutorials I didn't go to any tutorial cause I wanted a *real* lunch so yeah it was nice to have *real* lunch and actually have a good *talk* with others.  Matt mentioned to me how he thought I was attractive and how alot of the other guys I know think I am attractive too.  That makes me feel pretty good and well I think I help Travis feel alot better today too.  He was really upset and disappointed in himself cause he cheated on one of his tests and stuff, and he feels really bad about it and does not even know why he did it.  I tried to make him realize it is not the end of the world, and people do make mistakes and things like that do happen and it is reality.  I think I helped him feel a bit better though cause I just cared and stuff so I feel good about that.  I gotta go eat my dinner now then I got a big math test tommorow and I need to be well prepared cause I want to boost my average.  I have been working hard enough that I really do feel like deserve it, I deserve for my Chem average and my Math average to both go up.  I always go to tutorial and get help when I need it and stuff, but well today I took a break during tutorial.  I need to re-energize myself somehow and sometimes we just need to talk to others and have a good lunch with others.
