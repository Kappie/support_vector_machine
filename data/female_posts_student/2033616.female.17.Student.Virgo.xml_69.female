In other news, i don't have a car anymore.  I have a brand new appreciation for the invention of the air bag, (and remember people, wear a seat belt!) as well as a new hatred for the use of alcohol... esspecially when it's a 40 year old woman who doesn't speak english and drives a Ford Expedition.  Friday was not a good day.  But here's why i was going to post.  I've never really had to say goodbye to anyone.  I've never lost anyone suddenly.  The only deaths that I have experienced have been my Grandpa, who was sick for a long time, and Great Grandmother, who's death was more of a blessing she was in so much pain.  Both lived in Alabama, deaths that far away never really touch you as much.  I saw them... maybe every other year.  Point is, i've never really lost anyone.    I don't really remember leaving Switzerland very well, i know i was not happy when we moved here.  I was used to living in an apartment building with a friend behind every door.  I used to scare my parents by just leaving the apartment and going to play with a friend, or once even to a small house on the property where the students and their families would take turns staying for a while.  I had moved 8 times inside the building, from one apartment to the one upstairs, to the one down the hall, to the "house on the hill", and back into an apartment.  I guess i didn't realize that leaving the country would be different entirely.  What i can remember is that i was very sad to learn Sioux Falls was not like living at the seminary in Zurich.  Since then, i have never had to say goodbye.  But now i do.  I don't know how i will take this... b/c i havn't taken it very well up to this point.  But, to say goodbye with the prospect of "goodbye" meaning "goodbye, forever, have a nice life and don't bother to look me up, you'll never find me."  I'm not taking this well.  I feel abandoned and unappreciated.  Isn't it the strangest thing about High School?  The people you want most to be closest to, are the people that are still out of reach, yet the people that want so much to be close to  you   ... are the people you wish would leave you alone.  So, goodbye.  Forever. ~Eliza
