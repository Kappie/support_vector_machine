       
      My goodness; for once, I do not have any negative words pouring out of my fingertips. I don't think there are any words that could describe what I am feeling right now. I am not in complete euphoria, but I've had a lovely day. And I am listening to Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits right now-- a person could never feel down while listening to the queen of soul herself. :-)   I only have three more nights of work at Hardees, and that is so completely exciting to me. I'm not going to have a job, indeed, but it is going to be so nice to not have to deal with the people there anymore. Liberation at its heightened best.
