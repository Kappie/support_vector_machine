The only problem is the Royal Albert Hall has circular seating going to whole way round the building so the wave didn't stop until the music started, just kept going on, and on, and on. The best bit was when a group of people tried to start another one going in the other direction, it lasted for a little while until the two met and it fell apart a bit.
