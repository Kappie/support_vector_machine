Every day, donors pledge to give a certain amount of money/food to hunger relief efforts for every computer user who presses the button.  So do it, spread the word.  Check out the sister sites for Breast Cancer, Child Health, Rainforests, and Animal Rescue.  They're all linked, so you can get to them easily.
