She and her little friend nestled deeper in a beaver fur cape. Downy feathers tickled her cheek.  "I'll name you Snow Bird." she said. It was a good name, for the bird was white and weightless like the big flakes that stuck to the girl's dark lashes.  The tiny bird felt little more than a skeleton with feathers. He trembled. His warm body vibrated. Then he was still.  "I'll name you No Bird." she said and kissed the top of his head.  She buried him in the snow.
