I went up twice for Breakfast because I got like the smallest pancakes I ever did see in my life and I was still starving and we had got there early so I ate two plates.  Then I saw Chels and her mom and Chels and I went up to the platform and we got to see the major driving the train into the station.  Chels and I tried to huddle by the photographers and the cameras, lol.  When he got off the train it was like endless pictures over and over.  It was really neat to see what it is like to be known and be in the publics eye.  It was kind of cool.  Then he went around shaking hands, taking pictures with kids, and when he came to Chels and I we though he was going to shake our hands, but then he put his hand up and we high-fived him.  It was funny.  My mom said that he probably just wanted to be hip and "in" with the young people.  You know what, I think it worked.  After that my mom and I did a bunch of just little stuff, just going here and there.  Then I went to the YMCA for a workout.  I did an hour of cardio, 45 minute walk around the track, and I think about half an hour of weights.  Then I got home, and was hungry. You know I had envisioned eating like an apple for lunch, but as I opened my cupboard I discovered chocolates that weren't there before.  It was like calling my name I swear.  Besides, I think I worked out enough that it won't really have an effect.  I have managed to stay at 137, but I have shaped up and everything, my arms and my legs I can totally feel and even notice physically now that there is a difference since I started to work out all the time.  And well it's almost Stampede time and though I start Summer School soon it's like tradition to go to as many Stampede Breakfasts as possible, so really I mean bring on the pancakes and sausages.  That is what Stampede is about!
