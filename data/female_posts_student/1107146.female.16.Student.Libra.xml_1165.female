As for who is the minority...I'm not going to argue. But Latin and French  are  better. So I'll leave it to all of you to decide.  Chorus...BOO. Will...YAY. I don't have much time left, sorry.  Which is also why my "I'm just disappointed" post is not going to be in this one; but I  am  writing it down, and it  will  be great.  Thx for the "all of you are completely random", Abby. You should see us in person.  FREEEEDDOOMMMMMM, YEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Just practicing all, don't mind me. Heh.
