I didn't do anything in math really, I started to learn the waltz in gym, I think I did well on my french test, I went out for lunch, found out this big project I have to do isn't due for another week and a half, and then...well, 7th and 8th hour kinda sucked. Stupid tests. I was so out of it. I couldn't write properly for my essay test for satire. Oh well. It was a silly play. I'm glad it's over.   I kind of just realized I'm going to be 17 tomorrow. That's so weird...17 seems so old...older than 16 seemed definitely. I'll only be a year from being able to legally buy cigarettes. Not that I would because smoking is just GROSS but it just surprises me.  Marching wasn't bad today but oh my gosh...Nathan found this can of axe in the guys locker room and was spraying it. He sprayed me like...five times, and Peter once or twice, and Chris Z. like..10 times. Of course the three of us got rides home from Peter. Oh my gosh...that stuff is SO strong. We opened the windows but then something smelled outside so we had to close them again. AHH! It was just crazy. CRAZY I tell you!  I'm in a really good mood right now for some reason...YaY! :)
