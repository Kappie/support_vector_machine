So instead of conditioning for the full 2 hours we only conditioned for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we played. We still have varsity tryouts tonight for 2 hours, it should be fun, and then we do the same thing for the next week. On Tuesday we will know the teams, I think. Well that's the news on vball. I found someone who wants to take French 1/2 with me this year... we can be the 2 seniors in a class of entirely freshman, it'll be good. We just have to figure out how we can get into the same class, hopefully it works out. I'm watching BBC America right now, I just like to hear their accents, lol! There are some weird shows on it though. It kinda feels like school should start, I kinda want it to, but the thing is once it starts ur trapped for nine months, yikes... Well that's it for now. GOD BLESS
