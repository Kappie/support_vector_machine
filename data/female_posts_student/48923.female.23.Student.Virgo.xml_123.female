Wooo AAAAAh!")   thankfully the kids weren't hurt, and the dog obligingly went back into his cage.  he had other displays of demon dog, which were interspersed with displays of being cute and being tormented by the cats.  (i'm talking about a dog so small that he can't go up or down steps, and one of the cats was twice his weight.)   but dad didn't really react until...  the dog broke my youngest brother's skin. and dad returned the dog to the pound.  "We'll keep quarantine him for 10 days, and see if he dies from rabies."  the people at the pound said. Sometimes the ambiguous use of pronouns is scary, especially when there is a potentiality of rabies.   perhaps i should research a bit into the symptoms of rabies, because apparently "foaming at the mouth" isn't always a symptom.  it was strange how quickly attached my dad had become to this demon dog.  (they were only together for a month or so.) and there is something bittersweet about the impending death of a dog you don't like, but elicits tears from my dad.....
