This is a song by Beck, who is a total Genius  Go to sleep We're so tired now Altogether in a snake pit of souls New days To throw your chains away To try to hang your hopes on the wind  Little one Just a little way Today all we need is waiting  Night rise Like the evening prize In a turnstile backwards we fly Cold bones Tied together by Black ropes we pulled from a swing  Little one Just a little way Today all of the dreams are waking  Can't stand on crooked legs I'm cross-eyed to the wall In these harbor lights Satellites explode  Drown, drown Sailors run aground In a seachange nothing is safe Strange waves Push us every way In a stolen boat we'll float away  Little one Hold on All of the dreams are wasting  Copywrite Beck, whenever he wrote it, im note sure.
