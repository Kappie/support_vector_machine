These adverts are:   * Anything with Carol Vorderman (writing "lower" on a blackboard and circling it isn't science, Vorders, it's just stupid)  * Anything with Linda Barker  * Vagisil (no explanation needed)  * Ocean Finance (where do they GET those people?)  * Maestro (with the creepy penguins) * Senokot (incidentally, what do you take if you want UNpredictable relief from diarrhoea?)  * Norwich Union (I'll quote you f***ing happy)  * Mobile Ringtones (especially that awful one with the gyrating hippo)  * 118118  * P.I. Helpline (would you trust this man with your kids?)  * Nationwide Awnings (as endorsed by John Stalker and his realistic dog)  * eSure (I would happily kiss goodbye to my "no-claims bonus" for the simple pleasure of running over Michael Winner)  * Heat Magazine  * Campino Sweets (they couldn't dub this more badly if they tried)  * Safestyle Windows  * Evian (with the scary babies)  * Gold Blend (anyone for swinging?)   However, to prevent this being a COMPLETELY negative post, I have decided to balance it by mentioning something I enjoy more than I hate all these adverts put together: morons on game shows. I'm not talking about people who don't know the capital of Uzbekistan* or who the 11th President of the USA was**, I mean proper, honest-to-God morons. For example:   Q: What radioactive chemical element has the symbol U?  A: Water.   Of course, Family Fortunes is the best game show for this. (For anyone who doesn't know, they survey 100 people and the contestants have to guess the most popular answers.) The best examples of these stupid answers can be found  here .   * Tashkent  ** James Knox Polk  (And yes, I had to look both of these up.)
