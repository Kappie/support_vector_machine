NBC's Anthony Edwards!  Star of stage and screen Bernadette Peters!  and many more!  Okay, so I obviously wasn't invited to the Kennedy Awards or anything, but for a seventeen year-old living basically in Bumfuck USA this was a BIG DEAL.  In fact, my inner monologue began considering it THE BIG DEAL...the crowning achievement of my life thus far.  While I walked across stage...indeed, the very stage that former Miss Americas teetered across as they snuffed up snot and waved to 27 million adoring viewers...my information would scroll across the screen--National Merit!!! Plays the horn!!! Doesn't like pork!!!!--and I would be named an Admsvision USA Scholar!!!!!!      !!!!!!   !  Ahem.  One year later, our benefactor, Val Adms, was marched out of his office in handcuffs and convicted for fraud and embezzlement.  If we had checked, we would have determined that Val Adms had been indicted for more counts of fraud then I have fingers and was giving away his remaining millions as a last-ditch effort to sway the prosecuting attorney in his favor.  The TBS special never aired, and the money never materialized.  I was a minor celebrity in the Mid-Mo region for about a weekend.  I think I really only used up about seven of my fifteen minutes of fame, which is encouraging.  I got interviewed by a bunch of local journalists, and I even got to take a call from a Today Show producer concerning the scam.  He decided to use  the winners from Massachusetts and New Jersey on the show since they were paying for Ivy League schools and more of a pity case than me and my state university bills (and also probably cheaper to transport to Rockefeller Center).   Life was boring again until three large packages were left at my front door.  A company called Microworx give all the "winners" a free computer.  The next month, the president of Microworx declared bankruptcy and went to jail for...wait for it....monetary fraud and embezzlement.  (LIBEL DISCLAIMER:  I'm pretty sure that's what happened--I could be wrong)  So anyway, being a college student with minus $40,000 in the bank means that the same computer that showed up on my doorstep in 1999 is the same computer that is sitting on my desk in 2004.  The computer was five years old when the company liquidated their assets and shipped our pity machines to us.  The poor old thing is so crappy it's funny:  all the technology is called Pentium or whatever 2000  in that hopeful way that pre-millenium stuff was always called 2000.  Max2000 Technology!  Because 2000 will be way more kickass than 1994!  It also uses more obscure hardware than an Alfa Romeo; I have at least three different USB adapters plugging in new accessories to my ancient computer tower and trying to upgrade my sad old 32 MB of RAM?  Forget it.   It's pretty much a relic, but it was free and I never turn down free shit.  I've been praying my computer lasts until Jay and I finish our respective degrees, and I was in a state of panic all this week because Windows has been fatally excepting every five minutes.  On a whim, I opened up the tower cover to see if anything had fallen apart or if a small animal had crawled in to die.    THE DUST!!  Oh my Lord, the dust.  Dust bunnies weren't accurate for this mess...I think they had been obliterated long ago by the colonies of dust Rottweilers that congregated in every corner and cranny of the tower.  When I blew into it, My face was literally coated with ten years worth of dirt.  I also realized that everything inside the tower was white hot because the computer fan was so full of dirt it couldn't turn anymore.  I rooted around for an hour until I found an air duster thingie Wynton left behind and sprayed the crap out of my computer.  Really. Crap might have been in there.  So...computer crisis averted for now.  I'm really glad I didn't have to euthanize my old buddy just yet...mostly because it doesn't have enough memory to locate and delete all the porn files Jay saved on my hard disk and I wouldn't want it going to computer heaven with all those free facial pics on its conscience.
