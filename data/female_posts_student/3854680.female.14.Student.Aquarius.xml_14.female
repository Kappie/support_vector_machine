Keep in mind, not one of us is photogenic, but whatever, here they are anyways.  I still have to get some developed from the end of the year *coughcoughlunchtimecoughcoughcoughcough*.. And when I do, they WILL be posted, despite protests from a few (or one) of my closest friends..  Yes, you know who you are. Hopefully you'll still love me afterwards. ^__~  Check 'em out. Have fun.    ..just not *too* much fun..and make sure it's not at *my* expense.. ^__~
