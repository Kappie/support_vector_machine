Katie you sound incredibly hyper! bristol sounds like it might have been a little scary. i spent the day going to plymouth and coming back again. i miss thistle. she only went yesterday but i missed her trying to eat my feet as i went downstairs this morning.  ooo i could do stuff tommorrow (saturday) if anybody wanted to. i have to pack this evening. ('to get it out the way') so i'm free.  i'm quite scared about this present. but i'm sure i'll love it if it's weird and freaky. (a bit like me really) dont say anything.  it's the big brother final today. (self-confessed big brother freak over here) alex soooo has to win.  yey holiday on sunday! have nice holidays if i dont see you before.
