I'm actually very excited and very scared at the same time.  I've never been on my own before!  Classes this summer are going good.  I'm very excited about all the stuff I will learn in my X-Ray classes.  I also feel that Physics will be a breeze.  Everything else in life is ok.  A friend of mine wrote in their diary that alot of "scenes" in her life are put to music.  She went on to explain that some "scenes" in life just didn't feel complete without music accompanying it.  When I look back on my life, at the point where I was a high school student in Orlando, I find myself agreeing.  In Orlando, I made some pretty special friends.  These friends were not just my ordinary friends.  They weren't even my best friends.  These were people who shaped me into the kind of person I am today.  They inspired me.  They cultured me.  They showed me "the life".  The one person I think that sticks out the most in that category would be Meghan.  Meghan is two years older than me, and for the most part, I hung out with her and her friends in high school.  I met her at my first job, and the friendship grew.  We would take weekend trips to the beach as often as possible with her crew.  We would have so much fun.  Fun I never knew existed.  Meg became like the big sister I never had.  She became my tour guide to life.  She balanced me.  As you can imagine, I was broken when we moved to Ohio and I had to leave her behind.  Anyways, getting back to my point.  I was driving along the other day and I popped in a CD that I had burned and had not listened to in a long time.  A song came on that provoked some serious emotions.  I almost broke down in tears.  The song was Shania Twain's "Your Still The One".  No matter how much you think this song sucks, this song always makes me quiver when i hear it.  Why?  This was a favorite song of ours to jam to on the way to the beach.  It reminds me of the better times.  It reminds me of my big sister that I've missed so much.  I can still visualize sitting in the backseat of her car as we drove to the beach, all occupants of the car singing along to Shania.  I can remember actually laughing and feeling care free.  Feeling  happy .  I hope this story finds you all well.  I plan on visiting my sis soon, perhaps in the autumn or winter.  Until then, take care of yourselves.  And listen to plenty of music.
