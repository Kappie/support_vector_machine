Heh, he called me at 11pm. I was so shocked. I was so happy that he called. I missed him, though we just went out yesterday. HE just called to ask whether there's any news about some Mrt Line. The line that is going to his home was blocked, so he had to take another line. Well, the call ended fast.   My Wish: How i hope everyday, I will at least receive a message from him. A good day message, or Goodnight message. haiz... this situation still dont change...   Temptation in church...
