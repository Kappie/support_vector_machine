Let me say that again.  Cry.  Me.  Z.  The implacable.  Or something.  ;) And then again, she didn't really do it, but I was in such a bad mood to begin with that arguing with her and trying to prove how much pain I was in made me cave.  But I'm doing better now.  Honest.  Well, I think.  I also was upset for Becca at the time.  Obviously I know what it's like to lose people, whether they're leaving or dying, but I had no idea that this was some DISTANT relation.  For all I know, she really did care, except for Linds's testimony, but I can't believe that she would dare to think that an uncle, distant or not, is more important than someone's HOME LIFE FALLING DOWN AROUND HER.    I'm sorry if that was extraordinarily bitchy or mean or selfish, but now I'm really pissed off.  More so than I was before.  Linds was also right in the original sides thing.  Rosie, you really didn't turn me to your side.  I found out information, some from you and some from Linds or Will or whoever else, and that was what made me change my mind.  So don't feel guilty about it, Little China.  *grin*  Anyway, just had to say that.  Um, two things.  1) What did you mean when you said that Phillip's like me?  Just curious.  And 2) Those seniors have no idea what they're talking about, except for the biased story they've heard from Becca.  I mean, are they your friends, aside from Gunter?  If so, I don't know what you should do, but if not, then tell them to fuck off.  I'm serious.  They have no business getting involved.  Period.  Abby, I thought you knew me.  Kind of.  I'm not sure of that, but I thought you did.  ;)  hehehe  Also...if you don't want to hear anymore about the divorce, let me know, but I'm kind of using this Blog to get it off my chest.  I don't really have another place.  Anyway, this weekend my dad and I had bonding time.  ALL SATURDAY.  It was all right, but not really awesome except that I did get to see X2 which was REALLY GOOD.  Anyway, on Saturday I went to his new house.  Not to stay but just to look around.  It's in Mooreland, that place on Moores Lane on the way to the mall.  It's really little and WHITE.  It feels like a sterile environment.  I'm making him have my room painted.  Anyway, that's about it, but it was pretty hard to do it.  Don't think he picked up on that, so I guess that I'm making it through all right.  So, back to Operation Becca, just one question.  What the hell are we actually going to do about it?  Please let me know just so I have an inkling.    I feel like I should be really guilty about something or other right now.   Nah.  ;)  ~Z
