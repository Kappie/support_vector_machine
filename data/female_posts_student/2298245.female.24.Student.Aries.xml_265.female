I wouldn't say he is per se attractive, but everything about him just appeals to me, from the way he dresses to his lean build to his somewhat familiar face.  He reminds me, if this is possible since I don't actually know him, of a character I made up for my as yet and never to be completed novel.  This is the thing that first drew my attention to him - his face, his demeanor, is reminiscent of a figment of my imagination.  And so I started to watch him, and become more engrossed.  When I don't see him for a while, his face fades away quickly, and I almost am able to forget about his existence.  But that is the hard thing about law school - it is a small environment where you see the same people day in and day out.  And while I don't see him as often as I used to, I still look for him in all the old familiar places (I used to see him haunting the first floor of the library when I did as well - and even though I don't sit there anymore, I still glance over nearly every time I walk in, half-thinking I'll see him there yet hoping I won't).    He's a third year, so pretty soon he'll be gone, and it's likely that I'll never see him again.  I don't know a thing about him, but I do so wish I did.  Every time I see him, the same thoughts wash over me.  First, I think I do actually know him - this is the old feeling of familiarity in his face.  Then, I think, I'd really like to talk to him.  But I never even say so much as a word.  I've never been one for small talk, and whenever a situation like this presents itself to me, I run and hide rather than take the step of speaking and introducing myself, or even just saying hi.  Fear overcomes me - indeed, it overwhelms me.  It makes me feel foolish and weak, for I have taught myself that it should, that I should be strong enough for anything.  But I'd rather hide behind the curse of anonymity than actually stick myself out there and take a chance.  From someone like myself, who has accomplished so much, it might seem strange to hear about fear.  Yet it pervades my every thought some days.  Fear that I won't have anything interesting or useful to say, fear that if I put myself out I will quickly be pushed back and out of sight, fear that I won't be wanted, fear that everyone will figure out that I've just been faking it all along - that I don't belong, that I'm stupid and weak and useless, or worse that they will think that I am all those things, even though I know I'm not, because of my complete inability to be witty or articulate.  These are my thoughts in my darkest hours.  And these are my thougths now, because they always come out the most when I am stressed and busy and concerned that I won't be able to get everything done, that I won't measure up.  I could kick myself now for all the time I've wasted.  And this is the story of my life: procrastination, then looking backward, wondering what I could have done or should have done differently, rather than looking ahead to what I can still accomplish with the time I have remaining.  And then the misery really begins to flow, and I think how I am alone, and always will be - not that this thought ever changes my behavior, because I still don't put myself out there, and still hold back the few times I get caught out there, when I've managed to drop my guard accidentally for a second and found myself in that scary unprotected place.    I thought for a brief shining moment when I first started law school, in my first semester, that all was well.  For the first time in my life, I was on top of things, working hard and meeting new people, and I truly felt like a different person.  And I thought that, in a very short while, I would be dating someone.  There was this guy - a different guy (as an aside:  there are more and more, the older I get, that I could actually see myself with - I used to think my standards were getting lower from being alone for so long, really for forever, but I think that it is more that I am growing up and into myself, and am becoming more realistic in my expectations of the world...but I digress), that I honestly thought it was going to happen with.  I felt so content and sure, which is odd for someone like me who so seldom feels sure about anything.  But I think I was mistaken, or at the very least, there was a moment when it was possible, but it just slipped through my fingers, and with moments like that, you never get more than one chance.  I fancied myself to be falling in love - and indeed, I think that it was the closest I've ever come to doing so, and I still have very deep feelings for this person.  Though, like everything else, they go unexpressed - denied even in the company of those who know us both - in the hopes that my ignoring them will make them go away.  I've gotten way off track with this post.  This is what happens when one gets out of bed with the intention of spilling her guts in the hope that it will help her fall asleep.  All of that hopeful feeling that I started last week with has dissipated.  Like everything else I want, it seems beyond my grasp.  And I have only myself to blame for that, because all things that are beyond my grasp are only there because of my stubborn unwillingness to go and get them.  I know this is true, and yet it doesn't make me change.  It is not in my nature to change, and it is the hardest thing to do, to fight against one's nature.  So on I trod, hoping to make little pushes here and there, to get a little bit closer, ever closer, even if I never reach the goal.  But there's one thing I know for certain - even after all this, I will not dare to speak to or initiate contact with the mystery man.  I will continue to just catch fleeting glances at his familiar face from afar, and try impossibly to content myself with this, until he disappears from my life forever like so many others before.    The only thing I know about him is his first name.  And that is all I will ever know.  UPDATE:  Just FYI, because I know that it will invariably happen, as people I go to school with who read this will try and solve the mystery, "Samuel" is not this person's real name, or anything even close to it - I have used the name of the character of mine that I talked about above instead, to protect the innocent.  Hey, I am still a law student after all - and I may sound crazy, but I'm not stupid as well.  And I'm feeling much better, as always, in the light of day.  Sometimes, I think that it isn't evil that God needs to save me from, but instead from those worse natures of myself.
