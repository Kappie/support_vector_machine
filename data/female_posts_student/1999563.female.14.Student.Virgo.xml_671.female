I am quite excited.  But, I have a delima.  See, I was invited to this party at this girl  I barley knows house. So I said I could go..just because I have nothing better to do.  Then Heather invited me and all the HYPE kids to an olympics party and that sounds TOTALLY fun. Just because I will be with heather, Beka, Jacki, and everyone.  And now Kerry is coming.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!  Morally, I should go the that girls house for her party because I already told her I could go...but I don't really want to. I want to go to Heathers!!  Hum...  This weekend should be interesting...  Tomorrow..I am going to church. I think that's all..  Church should be alright.  I get to see Beka..but then again I have to go to "teen" church which isn't fun.  Hum hum.  Dude.  I can't think of anything interesting to say today.  Ooh! It just said on the news that Bush is coming to Portland on friday tooo! Haha!  I will totally see Kerry cuz you have to either pay or be a total Bush freak to go to his events. That's why I like Kerry, he lets all people come to his brohahas.  Yup.
