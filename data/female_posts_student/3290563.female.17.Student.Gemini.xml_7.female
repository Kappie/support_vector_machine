Fuck him man. I dunno what happened to my computer, but it ain't workin. I only have a short time to update this, then I'm going to do some homework. Whoa, yea, I'm going to do homework lmao.   Today was alright I guess. Nothing special happened.I had to work today and that went good. It stormed though. I love it when it storms while I'm at work! I have nothing to say really so I guess I'll end it right here.  Much love
