To buy List:    Girls Can Tell / Spoon    Hopes  Fears / Keane    Tyrannosaurus Hives / The Hives    Jennie Bomb / Sahara Hotnights       That is all. I'm off. I have some stuff to write about on here that I've been thinking about for the past few days but I can't be bothered right now. Tomorrow is my parents' anniversary and then the next day is my grandparents' one so this is the weekend (like every other year) where we all get together and go to this beautiful restaurant called Tavern in the Park. I'm excited.          Idioteque is fucking beautiful.          Later.
