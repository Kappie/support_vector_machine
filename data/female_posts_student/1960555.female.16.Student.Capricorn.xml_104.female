ZERO!  i was dead in the water.  stupid people wiht their stupid tests... why?  that's all i want to know.  why is it only 2 hours?  does everyone and their dog not already know that i take for fucking ever to write math tests?  gawd.  i'm so pissed off, this is just not cool at all.  [on the upside tho, me and my dad are going to see harry potter in... 2 minutes... maybe i should go get ready.... oh and i added a comment thingy, so go wild kids! chao
