Although I supose makes it interesting to watch although I kinda got bored of it after a while. But yea. No riots in Croydon last night, good. Just lots of people. So its good when England win because the hoodlums stay away. Woo!  First day back at school everyone? How'd it go?  I thought it was ok. I was very very tired though. What is everyone doing for September, dropping any subjects or taking up any?
