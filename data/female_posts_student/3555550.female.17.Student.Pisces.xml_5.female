I hate it when people are only in show choir because they are pretty I hate when people refuse to learn I hate people who cannot hold up their side of a debate I hate people who will not try to change my mind on an issue (I love to debate, but I guess some people are freaked out by my outspoken nature. I mean, I'm so open minded, my history teacher almost had me thinking like a democrat by the end of the year. Sadly, I spent a week with my dad, and I'm now back to where I began. *phew*) I hate sunburns I hate being hungry I hate stupid movies that have no reason to be shown  I hate technology (somedays I would rather just have my records and my typewriter. But then I stumble on the typewriter for a few hours and realize that I could just use the computer. So I resort to my 2004 lifestyle yet again and wish I had been born 35 years ago.) I hate physics class I hate P.E. (blah) I hate sardines (especially ON MY CAR) I hate drunk people I hate people who smoke around their babies I hate it when I complain...  Man, I want to do so many things this summer...just sparatic spontaneous things. *sigh* I think I'm in a shakespeare mood or something. I just want to look at the stars or fly a kite or swing on the swings or climb trees. I want the perfect made-for-tv childhood I never had.  *sigh*
