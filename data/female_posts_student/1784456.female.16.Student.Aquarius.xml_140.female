Sprained her ankle and spent ages in casualty! Awww :( Arghh this guy on the radio was winding me up, he was talking about all the latest tragedys on the news in this really happy jolly kind of way. Oh well, but just about the one thing you're allowed to do in life all of the time is be happy, so why not I guess? Probably cos if something really sad happens it is kind of hard to be happy, and if you do try and be happy, you won't be happy inside cos you know that you'll be decieving yourself. I really should stop talking now cos i'm starting to sound like Katie! Help! What's happening to me!?
