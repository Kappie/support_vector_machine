Her mind is Tiffany twisted  She's got the Mercedes bends  She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys  That she calls friends  How they dance in the courtyard  Sweet summer sweat  Some dance to remember  Some dance to forget  So I called up the Captain  Please bring me my wine  He said  We haven't had that spirit here since 1969  And still those voices are calling from far away  Wake you up in the middle of the night  Just to hear them say         ...... [in case some one is not recognizing the reference, those are lyrics from  urlLink the eagles ' " urlLink hotel california "]  Well, fuck dancing, I need something a little heavier.  So I have moved onto... Fucking to forget.  I asked Mr. Saturday who he was fucking to forget, but I was too drunk and tired to remember what he said.  Sigh... I hope my parents never, ever, stumble across this blog.   Well. last night was another hook up.  Not a full on one-night stand (no sex involved), but definitely a hook up.  In fact, I'd never met the guy before last night.  But it's not as sleazy as it sounds (that's a confession, not a defense).  He is a roommate/classmate of an co-worker.  And he is also a summer intern at a prestigious law firm and a student at a "one of the nation's top law schools" (but not the one I go to).  I shall dub him Mr. Law Student.    I guess he's good looking.  Or rather I am sure that 98% of my friends would say that he is better looking than Mr. David.  But honestly, every time I am with anyone else, I can't help but think about how much I miss david.  Which means that this whole fucking to forget thing is NOT WORKING!.  God damnit!  I've tried drinking and smoking and screwing and crying and driving really fast and going out all the time and staying in and reading or playing guitar and NOTHING NOTHING seems to work.    Sigh.  But I did promise juicy details. So here they are  Height: taller than Mr. Saturday night, but not by much.  Maybe 5'8 Weight/body. Well built, but not overly bulky Complexion: sexily swarthy. Part hawaiian Face:  I can't tell if he's hot or not.  Sometimes he looks really good.  sometimes he looks like he has a bit of an overbite.   Attitude: total player.  uses some really bad lines.  but then comes through with moments of sincerity and seems almost trustworthy. And, of course, the all-important cock-size: average.  god damnit! fuck david for spoiling me.  Seriously, everything seems like a fucking disappointment, or a disappointing fuck, in comparison.  I should put a small word of encouragement in here.  I used to not care about size at all.  In fact, I used to perfer sizes on the smaller side of average because of the whole pain thing and because it was easier to do a lot a things (i.e., blow jobs).   [Jesus, I really hope my parents never stumble across this site! But just in case they do: yes, I am using protection, both hormonal and physical].  Anyway, i just don't want to give any one a complex about dick size.    Okay More Details:  The Best Worst Line of the Night: You can touch it, it's okay The Cheesiest Observation of the Morning:  I never fall asleep cuddling, but I did with you. The Strangest compliment:  You have nice skin.   [I guess it's not that strange, but it is starting to weird me out because every guy I have been with has said this.  I, personally, don't think my skin is all that different from anyone elseâ€™s.  It's not like I use moisturizers everywhere every day.  Is this just a line that guys use these days?  If there are any guys out there that want to fill me in on this, please leave a comment.  Or for that matter,  girls, do you also get this compliment a lot?]  Alright. I hope that's a little bit spicer than some of my other posts.  Two other news flashes before I go:  1) Rod continues to e=mail me. Thank god. I really thought he wasn't to cut off contact again after that last e-mail (in which I went out on a limb and mentioned that I missed him and that I thought he was the cat's pajamas, or something to that effect)  2) David continues to ignore me.  Phone tag.  I left a message and then erased his number from my phone (for the millionith time).    3) Mr. Saturday night called on friday night.  Maybe I already posted that.  Anyway, we are supposed to get together for dinner some time this week  4) Mr. Law School is supposed to take me out to dinner sometime this week too.  hmm... maybe I should try to swing dinner with one, drinks with the other, in the same night.  That might be exciting (of course, I wouldn't take the first one home, that's just too weird, even for me).
