Spent the early afternoon with mom, clothes shopping. Spent the rest of the day with alex. In the end of the day, Kevin came over and me him and alex watched the rest of finding nemo. We got a big box this week. It turns out there was a tv in it. Now we have a big tv. "The Amazing Sounds Orgy" is a very misleading title, but still a good song. Alex and I were supposed to go see elf, but we got there too late, so we ended up just hanging out at the mall for three hours. It was fun. I got the second FLCL manga and some earrings. I also got alex some shoe laces since he was keeping his shoe tied with duck tape. Overall, it was a good day. I just wish I weren't so sick. Me: that's why the world loves you alex Alex: But the world doesnt love me Me: says who? Alex: The world Me: it's wrong Alex: Really? Me: yes Alex: How do you know this? Me: I am the world Alex: What a wonderful world  One of the only quotes of the day that I will ever do: Most people would rather be certain they're miserable, than risk being happy
