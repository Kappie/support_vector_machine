But it does have its good points, cuz I wouldn't need to buy lunch then, one of his friends will go instead. Saves me a lot of trouble.  Greatttttt.  I cant move freely around the living [ballet-in to TBS's songs] now. Pssh. Well, at least they're stopping me from getting super hyper.  Greattt.  It's no use looking from the bright side of things.  What's happening outside: Ah boon! blah blah.... [My bro's name is Boon Wei] *a few loud bangs*  Would they stop that racket? Arghh!! Hanyang stayed overnight yesterday, isn't it enough? Heaven just LOVES to torture me with a bunch of shallow-minded fuck-asses makin a HUGE racket.. Aahhhh!!! I'm so sick of this!  blehx...   At least I'm pretty much "away" from this [cuz I'm in my bro's room using the comp] and blink songs comforts me..hehe.  I'm listening to "M+M's" by blink of their album,  Cheshire cat .  As the lyrics go:  Somethimes I wanna laugh, sometimes I wanna take my toaster in the bath.   The early days of blink... *sighs* ...The words they use to rhyme... Well at least it's funny.  I'm off track. BLAH!! wadeva. ____________________________________  Silly me, ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com    a disco becuz of the noise.
