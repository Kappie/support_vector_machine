But she does need to get back i need to hang out with sum1 other then Jake for a while. I mean i like hanging out with Jake i just need to have other contacts too.But i well i am screwed right now. But yea. Yesterday Jake and I went to the movies and dinner again. This is becoming our sunday ritual. I kinda like haveing this as a ritual. It is way fun. We went to  New Port yesterday to eat and Tim was looking at me. (Tim is the cook there and he always tells Jake he will bring him condoms) But yea Tim scares me. He asked Jake the other day if " he had taped that shit yet?" RIGHT!  NOOOO  But yea. Jake had the house all to himself till tuseday. Then Jill comes home. Other events are going on then too. lol. we won't mention tho's tho. lol. But i don't really know what else is going on. I am starting to think of ideas for my party i want. There isn't too much i can really do around here. I wanna do the water thing but mommy says that would be to boring! O well i think tho that i want a stero and a bon fire. I don't know what else to do. I need to ask Cameron if his band is still together and get them out here to play sumtin that would be kool too. I just wouldn't know who to invite cuz i don't have a lot of friends and i want a big party. O well i guess i will survive.
