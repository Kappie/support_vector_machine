But today we drove to her collage on the way back from my friend's house, and I had fun. She gave me a tour and we drove around her old neighborhood. That was sad because she said it had gotten worse than when she lived in it. Those people were pretty poor. It really made me appreciate what I have. I know it sounds corny, but it's true. Then we went to go eat at this restaurant. The food was really tasty, and my mom told me some stories from collage. She told me she was a whore in a play, which I thought was hilarious. Probably because my mom used to say she made a lot of mistakes in collage, and MJ and I always joked that it was that she was a whore. Anyway, when we were heading home we talked more and my mom said that the town had gotten a lot worse since she was in collage. Still, it was pretty interesting to see a part of my mom's life I didn't know about. Then we went to DQ and got their new Brownie Batter Blizzard, which is delicious.
