I'll be ready on that evening when you're starved for my attention you'll say, "wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky above and a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention." -"When Paula Speaks"  You've got an extra special heart and a perfect light that shines through. But it seems like the hardest part is shining back at you. So forgive me if I don't know what to do when you look at me. There can be no hesitation; there cannot be a close second to you. I've got a perfectly normal heart, bruised and broken from within. At times I don't know how to start to let you in here. -"There Cannot Be a Close Second"  There's a love that transcends all that we've known of ourselves and I'll wait for it to come. It's got to be strong to touch my heart through it's shell and I'll wait for it to come. -"Coffee"
