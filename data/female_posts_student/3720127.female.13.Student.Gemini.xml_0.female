Today was as boring as ever. I woke up and got dressed. My mom then dragged me and my brother along to go to Kickboxing classes. We are going to start this summer. But I honestly don't know why. I already took classes and I'm also going to take guitar lessons which will already take most of my summer. Anyway, after that we went to Food Basics to get some, well, food. Then off to K-Mart. There we got sandals for my bro and new flip-flops for me. Then we finally went home. The house was the same as always. I just went to sleep and didn't wake up till dinner. After dinner I went back to sleep. I know what your thinking, I'm such a lazy ass bum. And the truth is I am. I am still also feeling sad because of Michael. When am I ever going to get over him? Can you answer that for me? Guess not. Oh well. Hope I get over him tommorrow but I highly doubt it. Going to go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 26, 2004  Whats up? I finally have some fun today. I went to my uncle's house. You might be thinking how is going to a family party fun. Well it is if the party is in that house. They have a huge house. My friends and I call it a mini mansion. They have a huge screen in the basement but that's not the only t.v there. They have 3 others. Each one is connected to a different X-Box. It's an arcade room actually. But the backyard is what really counts. They have an inground swimming pool with a diving board in the 11 feet deep end. They also have a basketball court. Notice I didn't say hoop, I said court. Yeah, they have an actual court with two hoops, a half court, foul line, you know the whole ordeal. The backyard is still huge even with those things. It's still big enough for two tennis courts. Anyway, I had a fun time swimming even though my painter was in. I got sunburn too. It really stings. When nightfall came we decided to stay because its a long ride back and my dad was drunk. LOL. Anyway I gotta go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 27, 2004  Hey. At my uncle's again. I had fun today too. I did basically everything I did yesterday. That was swimming. You know what I had so much fun yesterday and today that I almost, ALMOST, forgot about Michael. He just won't leave me. Arggghhhh. I'm going now because I want to concentrate on getting him out of my head. Bye. ~Prue~   June 28, 2004  Finally went home today. Bummed because of it. And because of him. I really don't wanna say the name. I guess I'll just stay home today mastering the art of being a lazy bum again. LOL. Actually I can't be a lazy bum if I keep typing this post, so I'm going now. Bye. ~Prue~   There another post. How bout that? Wait, no. I'm not a lazy bum yet. Wait. I'm going now to go back to my lazy bum state. Bye (for real). ~Prue~
