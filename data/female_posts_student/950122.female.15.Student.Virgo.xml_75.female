There wasn't a lot of people yet because it was Friday, and everyone's bolyets still had school. I didn't do much until the Art Attack started. We had to wait a while because it didn't start on time. >_> By the time it was our turn, it was soooooooo hot! x_x We had to do an art attack about Osama Bin Laden. The other sections got F4, Uncle Sam and Sadako/Samara from The Ring. We were only given 10 minutes to do it; 7 minutes to make it, and 3 minutes to clean up. Thankfully we actually finished it, but afterwards I was so tired... x_x I went to the MMA to rest, then I found out that my MP3 Player broke! > _> After that we went to the Baila. It was ok. Camilla and Racine slept over. I didn't sleep until 3am.  Second day was ok at first. I promised myself I'd be more careful with my things after my MP3 Player broke, but lo and behold, I lost my wallet that day. I don't care about the money that was in it; I just want the wallet with my friends pictures, my smal keepsakes.. Shit. Fredrick and some other AC guys went to the fair that day. They didn't stay for the Band Aid tho. I also missed the SHS Chorale concert because I didn't have any money.  Later on in the evening we watched the Band Aid. Was ok. I slept through part of it, but we stayed 'till the end. ._. Most of the people left after Rivermaya presented. Yeah, it was insensitive. But we stayed. :D  Went home afterwards, and slept.
