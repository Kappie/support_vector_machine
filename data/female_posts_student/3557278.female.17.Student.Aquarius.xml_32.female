I'm going to miss so many people :(  I really really do dislike school sometimes. I hate the favouritism. sometimes i just feel like noone really cares about what i do... its like there is the "select" few that are more "important" but then... i guess we dont appreciate the 'safety' of school, and it isnt all that bad. i mean we go, we muck around (and then spend our time working our arses off doing work >:(...)and there is stuff like dukes which i absolutely LOVE!! I'll miss that heaps.  dukes was so good! except for some of the yesuspension of classes in the grade school level; storm signal no.3 means automatic suspension of classes in the college level as well as government offices. But of course, this is discretionary on the part of city mayors and school administrators.suspension of classes in the college level as well as government offices.
