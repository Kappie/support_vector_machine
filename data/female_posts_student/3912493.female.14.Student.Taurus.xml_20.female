But I gotta stay strong to my decision. Since I didn't show up to the practice yesterday, Sally-chan told me that Mr. Williams was disappointed in me. This is what she said:   Mr. Williams was mad that you quit. He asked me why you quit and I said "I dunno" (I didn't wanna say you hated it!) and he was like WHAT!? SHE CAN'T QUIT! OH MY GOD! so that shows ya Mr. W loves ya! Oh and today was really fun, I wish you would have been there :( Mr. W also said that he's disappointed in you. He asked me where you were, and so did Ms. Shultz, but she didn't say anything except, "She QUIT?!"     I just knew Mr. Williams would be disappointed in me. I remember that when I was passing off my All-Region stuff in eighth grade, he asked me if I was gonna be in marching band next year. I told him, "Yeah..." and he said, "Of course, you must be," and started laughing. Hehe, now look at me. XD   But that didn't really matter...until I read my e-mail this morning. It was from Michael-kun. This is what it said:   hey daniela! everyone was asking me why did you quit, mr williams says hes disappointed and michelle, yaqui and sally told me to talk to you about it...I think I influenced you to quit...I was going to quit today but nobody wanted me to leave, so i talked to Dr. Shine about moving to concert band...he told me that he usually doesnt make those kinds of exceptions, but if I am still very tired...he'll look into it....maybe you can do the same thing...i know that its your decscion to make...but i promised michelle i would talk to you, it doesnt matter to me if you want to come back, ill just tell them I didn't get a hold of you=^^= anyway, come back if you want, stay home if you don't...doesn't matter to me, cause... i'll still love you=^^= ::hugs and kisses:: bai bai     That made so fuggin' upset. I'm tired of all these people who don't respect my freakin' choice. Where's the support? Wait, there isn't any? My friends are just being fuggin' selfish, I thought. They're just thinking of themselves, not me. So I wrote an e-mail to them: Michael-kun, Yaqui-can, Michelle-chan and Sally-chan. This is what I wrote:    Hey, guys...    I just wanna say that Michael-kun  did not  influence me into quitting band. I was already thinking of doing that long before marching camp started. I was planning on  not  quitting band because of my friends, but I decided that I would not let you guys make me do something I  don't  want to do. If you read this, then it'll let you know how I really feel about this situation.  It was not an easy decision to make.  I gave this a lot of thought, so don't you even  dare  telling me that I didn't think of this.    I really don't care who is disappointed in me or who isn't. A lot of people will be disappointed in me throughout my life, and Mr. Williams will not be the first person. I quit band because of my own will, not because of Michael. I don't wanna stay in band just because you guys are in it. If I do that, I won't be enjoying it.  I don't care about the field trips, I don't care about skipping classes because of contests, I don't care about band!  You guys just have no idea  how hard  this decision was to make, and no matter what comes out of it, good or bad,  I'll know I made the right choice . Why? Because I didn't let any of you guys make it for me.     I just wish some of you would respect my choice.  I quit band because I don't like it anymore. Not everything is going to come out the way  you  want it, and this is one of the things. Believe me, this breaks my heart because I won't be in band with you guys any more, but I can't stay in it just because of that. I just wish I could get some support, not only from my parents and Michael, but from my friends. I feel so freakin' lonely once I made this decision. What's this? My friends are upset at me because I quit band?  What kind of friends are you , trying to make me do something I don't wanna do?  So don't try to talk me out of it.  Nothing that you or any band director tells me is gonna change my decision. Just respect it, and leave it. Stop teasing me about it, because this is  not  fun. You guys have no idea how much I'm upset because of this.    I wrote this little...whatever you wanna call it when I was feeling trapped and not knowing what to do: whether quitting band or not. If you wanna read this, then go ahead.  It's my life, not yours.      Support: that's all I'm asking.      Then I wrote the blog entry I had written yesterday. I was so upset at my friends. I was the one disappointed in them: because they wouldn't respect my decision, much less support me. Wait a minute...did I even have friends at that time? Where are your friends when you need them? Where's the  encouragement  when you need it?   Pissed off: that was me at that moment. What were my friends thinking?! The only people supporting me now were my parents, Michael-kun, and Mike. Ah, yes, Mike: the person who always makes me laugh no matter what. I'm starting to think that he's the only one that can really understand me. And heck, that's crazy because I don't know him in real life.  What did my friends want? To stay in band just to make them happy, but then I'd be the one being miserable. They'd be pleased, but I'd be depressed. Was that what they wanted?! For me to be sad and uncomfortable just to make them freakin' happy?  A while later I got a reply from Sally-chan. This is what she said:   De: Sally Enviado el: Martes, 10 de Agosto de 2004 05:32:57 p.m. Para: sikaru64@hotmail.com Asunto: RE: Living with it I read the whole thing, and I am feeling stupid as ever right now. Sure I wanted you to stay in band, but I shouldn't have given you so much grief over it. I didn't know that you were feeling all those things. I can now see that band is just not right for you anymore. You have a lot of courage to quit. When I was saying I wouldn't talk you you anymore, I was kidding. You are awesome, how could we lose our friendship over BAND!? I want to thank you so much for sending me your thoughts, because now I can fully understand why you don't want to stay in marching band, and best of all I  can  support you. So, please forgive me for acting so foolishly!! Let me close by saying you are a great writer! Talk to ya soon, -Sally      I didn't reply to that, but I felt a little more happy now that I had gotten at least one person to support me...to understand me. Not even ten minutes passed and I received a reply from Michael-kun:    De: M.T. Tenchicat Enviado el: Martes, 10 de Agosto de 2004 05:41:20 p.m. Para: Sikaru Urashima   Asunto: support DANY!!! That was very good, i should be following your example. I understand how you feel, I will proabably quit as well, but i'm going to ride the week out. If i don't like it, i'll quit, if something changes...i dont know...but if you need anything at all, I WILL be there for you! Even if you were jumping out of a burning building, I'll be there to catch you. I wish some other people could be more supportive of your choice...my dad even thought you did the right thing=^^= but if it takes me to quit in order for the others to realize why you made your decision, I'll do it...no questions asked...if the rest have a problem with it, fine...its THEIR problem...not yours, not mine, but THEIRs! You do what you have to do...and I'll be right by your side...i dont care if we are the only ones making the same decision, and everybody else is still following everybody else, ill support you and try and help you with your needs as best as I physically, mentally, and emotionally can. =^^= I wish i had a big enough vocabulary to express my feelings toward you, but the words don't come to my head=^^= alright...bai bai luv ya lotzas!     I won't ever let anyone decide for me. This is my life, dang it. Doubt erases, support rises. That's what friends are for, huh?
