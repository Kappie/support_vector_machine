They make me feel so fulfilled, although I do not quite know why. I absolutely adore just pausing and letting the very winds of life blow through your hair, in one ear and out the other, and letting these winds inspire creativity. God, I don't know what is with me tonight, but I feel as if the entire world is in my hands. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, and do it because no one is stopping me. I am not stopping me, like I normally do. I feel so content right now, and I don't know where this has come from. Goodness, I swear I have split-personality disorder. Just an hour ago I was crying and could safely say I felt for the first time in my life why some people commit suicide. They feel cornered--I felt cornered--and that's really scary to admit. But at the same time it makes me marvel at the way that I work. I have true confidence in ways that some could never imagine, and I know that I am able to conquer many of the things that I fear just because I would like to know that I set no definite borders for myself. I love the things that scare me.
