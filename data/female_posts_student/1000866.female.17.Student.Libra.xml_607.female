I had to work which kind of sucked because I worked for six hours and...I've now decided that's the worst shift to work. You get a paid 15 minute break every four hours but if you work for six hours, you get gypped. You still only get one break. So, blah. I had to push carts for two hours too since they scheduled one person to do it for four hours in a row. Boooo. :( Then today I'm working from 3-11. Byebye last two nights of spring break. Ah well. I don't care anymore. I just really don't want to go back to school yet. Usually I'm ready but I'm  definitely not now. I don't want to see people. Hah. I've seen most of the people I want to see over spring break outside of school. With the exception of a few of course but still...I'd eventually see them outside of school. So, boo school.   And now, I have to go find something to eat and do something relaxing before work. Ugh. Shoot me. :)
