To her only fate, seize the fate. I’ll stay strong.   Pre-chorus  I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you.    Chorus   The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over.   Verse 2  You make it so hard to say goodbye, So I’ll just stay by your side. What makes me so special? Honoured to stay with you.    Pre-chorus   I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you. I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you.   Chorus  The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over. The Story’s dead and gone, You have to let it go. Have I lost you yet? Or will I when it’s all over.    Verse 3   You make me feel alive. Just one touch sends me to ecstacy. Hand in hand, we’ll walk together, Forever to be, just you and me.   Pre-chorus  I’m Waiting, I’ve waited so long for you
