I went to tractor supply and got some doggy shampoo and wanted to get wormer but they were out so i went to walmart and got some more food and wormer and i saw some glitter dog shampoo and it wasnt fair cuz my mom wouldnt let me buy that stuff since we had already gotten this nasty green stuff for her fur. lol it was cool though, and mom wants me to give her a bath once and week at least so she stays clean and gets used to being bathed. Shes gonna be so cute!! I wanna get her a hot pink collar with reinstones or spikes. haha i think hot pink with sliver spikes would be sooo cute!! haha Shes gonna be a bad ass bitch, litterally. lol Shes so cute!! i just love her to death!! The funny thing is, i dont like dogs..at all, unless they are the cute little indoor ones, like laurens. lol But, i have always wanted a german shephard and sure enough one came up and needed a home. So yay! lol i gave her a bath and dried her with my hairdyer and filed her claws because shes been kept up and her claws were too long. So, shes all fixed up now. :D Shes sleeping in this crate/cage thingie on the porch, i really wanna bring her in, but we just wormed her and shes gonna have to go to the bathroom sometime or another. lol Shes very anti-social, we can tell shes prob. never been really held and she doesnt answer to me when i call her, so i cant let her go out in the yard right now. I think i'm gonna give it about 3 or 4 days until i do that. Shes so cute!! haha ok. i got my new pet..yay!
