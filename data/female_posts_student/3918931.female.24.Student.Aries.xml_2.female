Theycontinue to attempt toescape the cages. We're hoping they will settle down if we give them enough time to establish themselves.  So, mostly today I just drove around the property and took some pictures. The picture you see there is from a road called "King's Highway." I'm sure you can see that it is quite a mighty expressway. However, that road used to be the mainroute of transportation for this part of the east coast back in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It also just happened to be one of the manymajor slavetrading routes in the country.  Alrighty, I'm off to the P.I.T. with the rest of the research team. urlLink
