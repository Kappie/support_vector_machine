Word for Word...i feel this song.-jess  I'm so tired of being here  Surpressed by all of my childish fears And if you have to leave  I wish that you would just leave  Because your presence still lingeres here  And it wont leave me alone  These wounds wont seem to heal   This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you's scream i'd fight away all of your fears And I've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  You use to captivate me   By your resonating light But now I'm bound by this life you left behind  Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all of the sanity in me   These wounds wont seem to heal  This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears And i've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that   your gone And though your still with me  I've been alone all along
