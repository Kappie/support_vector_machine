He offered some advice on redemptive suffering, on the fact that I'm nowhere near that yet but that's not terrible.  I need to get through those KÃ¼bler-Ross stages first.  We also talked about God's will and not being able to understand it, and that's okay (like a trapeze artist - you're letting go of the one ring behind you, and moving towards what you hope will be a sturdy ring in front of you, but you can't see it and you're literally suspended there in mid-air, unsure of whether there's even a net underneath you, but you have to trust and reach out for that next ring or you will fall.)   We talked a little about Fr. Pat which made me laugh (Marilyn this morning gave me nice anecdotes about him tracking down Denzel Washington for her even though he had no idea who Denzel was!) and D. told me about Fr. Pat's slightly more annoying side and trips in to interrupt D. while he was showering!  He lent me another book - Henri Nouwen's "Can you drink the cup?" - and suggestions on how to read it.   He said that he will always be there, no matter what, not judging me, not thinking less of me for anything that I say, and if I want to feel stupid about needing help, that's up to me, but I shouldn't feel like I'm wasting his time or anything like that.  I gave him a big hug on the way out and I left again feeling like a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulders.  More to come...
