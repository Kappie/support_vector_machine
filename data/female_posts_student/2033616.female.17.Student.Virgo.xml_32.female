After Aliesha left i did some homework and then fell asleep watching the All State Concert on TV (which was awesome ;-)).  On Sunday, we went out to eat at Red Lobster after church and then went shopping.  Did the cell group thing at my house which went pretty well.  Then Bells and home to finish homework.  I didn't have much homework, but i was still up till one.  You see.. when i'm ESSPECIALLY happy... for things like... someone has solved world hunger, or the whole in the ozone is closing, or one of my best friends and I want to try and figure out what's wrong and fix it... well being extreamly happy makes me very energetic... so at 11 o clock last night.. before i finished my homework i did laundry, organized my closet, and cleaned my room, and then finished my homework.  Exciting stuff i know.    Hmmm.. i feel like rambling... Kyle wore color again today!!! only b/c i gave him answers to a worksheet last friday.. but get this.. he wore.. RED... the color RED.  Are you as surprised as I was?    Mateja and I went to the Chicken Dinner tonight and it was excelent.  While waiting in the audi. we had some very good disscussion.  We talked about dating and faith and such.  It was a lot of fun.  Mateja is just so much fun to be around, she's so bubbly.. it just makes your day.  Well we finally left around 10 and i got to drive Mateja's car two blocks to my house.. a big feat considering it was manual.. (note to self... next time i'm learning manual... drive somewhere with absolutly NO traffic).  We will have to continue our lesson at another time.. and place.  So then Mateja stopped in for some leftover pizza and went home.  And
