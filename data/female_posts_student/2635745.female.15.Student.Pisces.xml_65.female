My braces are off!  My braces are off!  My braces are off!  My braces are off!  My braces are off!  My braces are off!  Ok thats enough of that, but they are off....FINALLY!!!!  But b/c my gums were so swollen they couldnt take molds for my clear reatainer today I have to wait a month for my mouth to get used to not have braces in but in the meantime i have another retainer which is really hard to get used to.my teeth are soooo white too.  with braces my obsessive compulsive brushing didnt show but now it does.  It's kinda scary but at the same time cool.
