It's lyrics are something that have really had an effect on me for the past couple of weeks. One being that it seems to be so true in meaning through my perspective. There are some lines that goes:  Men are delicate Origami creatures That need women to unfold them And hold them when they cry   Now, being who I am and all, I took that to not be so "general" as some might take it. Yet, these past couple of days have been quite testing with me and now I'm coming to realise that in various ways those lines are indeed true. Take my brother for example, no he's not a "man" but you need to view the concept I'm trying to convey here not the technicalities, he can be quite a pansy at times. He'll run off and do whatever, proving that he is a complicated little origami creature. For he has all these "things" about him that you can be quite amazed at. Sometimes it seems that he's created by the parchment of Ignorance, Foolishness[ mind you that in a way, we all have those qualities, I'm just super mad at him right now. . .  ]. Then that parchment was folded again and again to create him. Every time that origami falls he always seems to need exactly a woman to unfold him and hold him, a female saviour. Just like his father. Runs about and around and only comes for some form of affection or something similar to that. Or maybe I'm just not having a very nice perspective of the "male species,"so to speak, and that's mainly for the fact that most ones around me, as in Men, seem to have a quite positive effect on me at first and then either they or my mind turns as cruel as Tanzi can be.   Sometimes I feel as if I could cry because of them. But I guess that's because they're mainly from the same culture that gives young ladies and women only two choices in life. Which are to either get married and become a mother of like at least 4 children or become a nun in the Roman Catholic church. Naturally, of course, respect for me lessens because of that. . . Or maybe they seem to not like me and who I am becoming because they seem to acknowledge my accomplishments and then forget them But always seem to remember my failures and flaws. Plus, some just won't, and or don't, seem to believe that I'm not the same 9 year old that loves to help Everyone and watch babies. I'm now a 14 year old with plans that Will clash with yours and am becoming quite defiant with what you believe to be best. I won't let a man claim me, abuse me, run to me every time he does something foolish, control me, and Only come to me to cry on, I can't and will never. The day for something like that to happen and their culture to be my future is the day that poor Berni, poor Chi, lost her sense of herself and needs to be saved and reminded of who she is and what she believed in before it's too late. For no matter what they say, they don't seem to love me as much as some of you do, at least when it comes to what I like and enjoy and most importantly Believe in. . . And plus, the rest of the song goes:  And I am tried of being your savior And I am tried of telling you why  Funkeh!^_^
