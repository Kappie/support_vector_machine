I routinely go to school, take classes with out having any reason to why I am taking them.  I guess it's because I want to go to college.  When I get there I will probably still be in this funk of "what the hell am I doing here?" and end up drifting through college with no idea of what I want to do with myself.  I'll end up as some old lady still trying to figure out what I want to do, then realize how old I am and that I've somehow managed do go through life doing absolutely nothing.  This is all I do.  My current job in the world is to wonder what I am doing and what I'm going to be doing.  That is it.  I don't  do  anything else.  I sit at home when I'm not at school passing time by doing nothing, really, I can't even recall doing anything worth mentioning.  I go to movies but is that anything special, not really.  And then I find myself thinking like I'm thinking right now and I scare myself.  I am a crazy person.   Well, I did play Risk today, and that's enjoyable. Mwahahaha, take over the world, master and commander :)  anyways...maybe I'm just tired.
