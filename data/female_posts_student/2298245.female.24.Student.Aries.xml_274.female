This in itself may seem unremarkable in our age of terror and violence.  But the woman's five year old daughter was in the house at the time of the shooting.  This little girl is one of my mother's students (for those who don't know - my mother owns and runs a dance school and teaches ballet there), and there are things that are not in the article (or anywhere else for all I know) that make this story particularly heartbreaking.  The man shot her mother in the driveway, then went back into the house, where he saw the little girl.  He waved at her, pulled the gun out from behind his back, and shot himself right in front of her.  This poor little girl is going to be traumatized by this terrible event for quite some time.  If you are the praying type at all, perhaps you'll want to throw one in for her and her remaining family.
