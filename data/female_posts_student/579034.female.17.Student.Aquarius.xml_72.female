Well there hasn't been much going on in Lauren Land or this crazy place called New York (Staten Island). I got a 1000 on my PSAT which is a hell of a lot better then I got on it last time so I was really happy and I e-mailed Greg saying thanks cause he helped me out a lot with it. Then there was the Cross Country Dinner/ Dance which was a lotta fun. I was so comfy in my jeans. I really wanted to wear sneakers but I didn't. I danced with Danielle, Debra, Erica, and just the whole team as a group. Then I danced with these three other guys, I'm not quite sure what school they were from but it was fun. It was a lotta fun. By far the best of the three total that I have been to. Things with Mick are going well. He will be here in about a week which is very cool. And my grades are doing very well! In fact, I just got word today that I got a 101 on my math test so GO ME! I calculated my avg. and its an 89 but I gotta also wait and see what my midterm avg. is and then I gotta avg. that in with the 89 and then with the 85 from last quarter. But all in all I been workin hard and kickin ass. :: hiya :: So yea... not much drama which is good though the whole family thing flares up every now and then. But I'm gonna follow my own words and say "keep hope alive". I'm thinking of having a trial. Not a like "I'm Right, Your Wrong" trial but a like trial so that each side can hear out each other in a neutral place and we can discuss, and solve the problem. I don't think my mom or aunt will go for it though but hey I think it would probably help to put things in perspective for them ya no? See what each side has to say right from the others mouth instead of from other people.  But, Christmas is comming! YAY!! I think Canada has the same Christmas as us but those fready deaky Canadians might just switch things with their New Prime Minister (those who saw South Park last night will know what I'm talkin about.... I think you understand.... lol). OH YEA!! We caught the bastard Saddam Hussein (sP?)!! Go America, I tell ya. We just rock the casba, litteraly... ha ha, knee slapper. AND I saw  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  the other day with Dave (no I wan't imagining, there was a REAL Dave there) and Vin Fea. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!! Omg It was just PHENOMINAL (sP?). It was deff up there with one of the best movies of all time. A little long, yes (3 hours and 20 minutes), but worth every minute?   HELL YES  !! So yea. That's about all that's really been going on. Not too many people have told me deffinite answers about my New Years Eve party yet. I really hope like everyone comes cause I mean I really wanna have a big party ya no? But yea, that's enough for now. Much Love x0x0x0x0x
