If you're fun then why use drugs? Insecurity I guess. Must be some thing to do with how you don't think other people think you are nice and you need to get smashed to know that. (shut up!) Sorry moral ramblings day! Les personnes intelligentes n'ont pas besoin de dire d'autres qu'elles sont intelligentes. (uhuh!) Hey what can I say I'm going hyper talking to Izzy and I'm bored! Ooh, I went to Ikea and now I love that store! My rooms going bright pink and I got these pink pillow cover things... yeay! My last covers I've had for about ten years! We got a load of groovy stuff too! Yeay! Oh and we did know about the big vegetable cause we told you, it's a french phrase like our big cheese thingy. I love Ikea! Sorry, did I forget to say that? :P I'm gonna go, bro's doing drama (GCSE stuff) plus I've got a few jobs and we're gonna make orange ice-lollys! YEAY! Sorry I'm really excited! Woohoo! Bubi!!!!!!!!!!!!!
