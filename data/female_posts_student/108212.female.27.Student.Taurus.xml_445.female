If you wanted to check it out, you can visit  this site .  Once again Ching, thanks for hooking me up with the space for my blog.       Anyways, I also wanted to share Cel's graduation picture to the rest of the blog members so here it is. Congrats Cel on your long awaited graduation!  We all hope that you can visit us here since you're already done with school.
