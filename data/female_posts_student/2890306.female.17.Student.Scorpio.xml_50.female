I'll be a senior next year, and as my brother says, "Ahhh, power!"  Yes, broja.  Power, indeed.  Today was filled with nice feelings.  I had a grand time waking up at the time I was supposed to be downstairs, scurrying as I usually do to arrive downstairs on time.  It rarely happens.  *shrug*  Maybe I will improve on my time management skills in the next year.  It will be a necessity, for my loving maja and faja will not be there to poke my lazy butt out of bed.  Perhaps the only person helping me in that department will be my future roommate.  Cynically, she will blast me out of my dreamlike state with a loud blaring of killer, loud, guitar riff-filled music and the delightful smell of a Marlboro.  *frown*  Optimistically, however, I'll be woken by the voices on her yoga VHS tape and the lovely smell of a toasted bagel with cream cheese that she bought for me as a thank you for helping her study the night before.  Yes, now wouldn't that be something?  Call me an idealist and I'll... agree with you.  *sigh*  One event I look forward to next year is the trip to San Francisco, California.  Thus, I have chosen "California" by Phantom Planet as my song of the day.  I'm going to choose one every once in a while now.  (Quick note to my buddaloo Cindel:  I bought the CD on Amazon.com tonight.  Thanks for introducing me to the band...I love 'em!)  Anyhoo, the song makes me think of Cinnie, and the locale makes me think of Jacob, so it is to you both I dedicate this with love.  Hopefully when you listen to it, it will make you feel just right and content, as I do right now.  In fact, I feel infinite.
