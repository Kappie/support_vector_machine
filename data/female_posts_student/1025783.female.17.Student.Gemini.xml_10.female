That first night was pure fear dripped drop by drop into a great basin stored by Satan. They had broken through the windows, running into the house- their bodies mangled and bloody from ragged glass. My father's body we found the next morning, or rather, what was left of it. They had clawed through his stomach, ripping out organs and using the blood to write profanities on the house walls in typical teenage angst. In the house they had reeled, our only reason for survival was of pure speed. All I remember is running, legs pumping heart stabbing and looking behind me. There were three of them immediately trailing me, bodies reeling and eyes glazed- maniac laughter boomed through the house. We lost some of the older servants, but my heart had grown cold and I only thought to Darwin that night. We hid in the basement, doors barred with steel as we listened to their moaning and unearthly laughter beat at the doors. We lay there, water dripping in little rivlets, dark shadows choking us, as they pounded against the great oaken doors. Their need for fresh blood drove them crazy, we could see through their glittering eyes. The sun eventually rose into another cold, frostbitten morning- and then they were gone. We emerged from our black tomb cold, wet and shaken. But we were stronger. From that day forth we experimented and through trial and tribulation found what they feared and what they dispised. My father's death was a model for what could happen to all of us, a vision that made us work all the longer. During the day we would run to the nearby stores just down the hill, ignoring decaying bodies and push our way into the delapidated grocery and hardware stores. Here we stocked up on the essentials- nails, canned goods, wood, tools. These are what kept us alive. We built up our fortress, knowing no other way to live. It was grim, but human instinct kept us from giving up. They showed up every night, always coming from over the hill facing east- brandishing torches that made their faces glow and jump with flame. Their routine never differed. ALways the same horrific, mechanical spinning and jerking that they called dancing. Always Lily looking up towards my third story window where I hid and watched, always her smiling that monstrous smile and singing to me. Her voice always seemed to reach me, shrill and so alarming, yet soothing. It made me dizzy, and sometimes I found myself yearning to be with her. The days grew shorter and shorter, and the nights stretched themselves into great black ribbons of hell. I found myself being driven slowly crazy as I watched them arrive by nightfall, so thirsty and so willing.
