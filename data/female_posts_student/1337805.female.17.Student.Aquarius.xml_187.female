I'm currently very warm, sweaty, and probably stinky too, but I can't help that. Went to school yesterday, went home around 3rd block, couldn't stand to be there. Wanted to go to bed.  And mom went hunting through my purse for whatever reason and found my bc pills. I won't buy it because those are in the secret compartment, and they can't "fall out" of there. I'm feeling pretty violated right now, and she said something really lame about it too last night. I was begining to fase out, so I barely remember. All I know was that it's lame. And my parents are probably not to impressed. I feel like I've let my dad down, hugely. He was so disappointed..I mean, he was proud of me for being responsible, but.he doesn't understand. It sucks.  I'm sooooooo warmm...And theres's no one to talk to. *tear* You people are mean.  Upset.
