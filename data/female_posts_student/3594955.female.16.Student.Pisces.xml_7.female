My other two choices are Spain and Canada…and I supposedly find out what country I’m going to in 2 weeks.    Some ladies whose kids went on AFS came round last night to talk to me and my parents mostly about what it will really be like, the whole fundraising, spending money, flying over there, school, friends, homesickness etc. Apparently I’ll be flying by myself (meh, no biggie) but there are AFS people at all the airports and stuff to tell you where to go.    I might not actually find out who my host family is until just before I leave the country but oh well, as long as I have somewhere to sleep I’ll be fine.
