I glance across the room, to see if anyone else hears it too. But no one seems to notice the look on my face. I miss you so much, I keep telling you...                                                 But you'll never be completely gone, because every time i close my eyes, there you'll be. Even though it hurts to hear your name, and speak of you; One thing I will always say is You Were always there....You don't know what you've done for me, But I tell you now, you answered my plea.        It's time to let you go...Bye
