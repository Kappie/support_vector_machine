Along with soluble fish... hmm... this would have to be a pretty dumb dictionary. *looks to you* Hey! You've got to be dumb if you've actually got this far in the blog! *EUGH* Soo any way *quickly changing the err unidentifiable subject into a even more unidentifiable subject* (EH?) Umm... flowers? Okay pretty bad but any way. I'm just sitting here waiting for my phone to ring... any second now... Don't you hate doing that? Knowing *slightly* that some one's gonna ring, but being unable to phone them. Wait a second. No. That's probably just me. I blog too much don't I? Mmm... way too many anti-climaxes today. (Piano pieces actually, there's this big build up a then a *twang* that's supposed to be the ending chord! What is with that?!) Argh I'm supposed to be writing one! I can't remember how fanfares go! *thump = head hitting table* God I'm gonna fail music! Oh yeah, I saw Johnny *can't spell* English yesterday, we were the oldest people -minus the kids- there! Never mind... Oh and it was incredibly stupid if you're into that type of thing. (And I am)
