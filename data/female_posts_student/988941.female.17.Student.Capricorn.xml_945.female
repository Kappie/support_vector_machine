On my Kit-Kat that I have just eaten it did not have Kit-Kat written on it, but on one bar “break” and the other “here”. My chocolate has ingraved into it instructions on how to eat it. What else I'm I going to bloody well do with it? It's a fucking Kit-Kat, you break it down the middle, that's why it's there, that's why it has that massive line, everybody knows that and if they don't they are too bloody stupid to read!  Unfortunatly I can't boycott Nestlé otherwise I'll have nothing to eat in the mornings (Shreddies, ummmm). But I'm boycotting Kit-Kat, along with McDonalds, Burger King and the Heathrow Express.
