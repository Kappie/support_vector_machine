I mean brody and allie are my best friends and i think its becuase they have known me for so long that they just understand how i am. and then vaughn was like the *first love* thing and he was the only good thing that happened to me last year. and then he just up and leaves. And right when i feel like im getting over that i meet jesse. I mean he was so cool back then but now it just sucks. it sucks that we were ever that close because now we aren't. and i want so bad to end it because i feel like maybe me and pete could have something but probably not. and everytime i try to tell jesse how im feeling i think about how it used to be and i never say anything...damn.  ~peyton pryce~   CHECK OUT- she's gunna break soon by less than jake
