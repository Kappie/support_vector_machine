It's a  urlLink Viking Line  cruise on their  big  ship called Cinderella :o)  I've been using my  urlLink livejournal  more; I like the friends page feature and hope someday blogger has a similar thing. I may just end up using this thing more and more in the future as I grow out of livejournal, as my  urlLink hubby  has. ;o)  Guten Nacht! Godnatt! Good Night!
