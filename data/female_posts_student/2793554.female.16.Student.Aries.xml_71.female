SO, if ive been mean to you today, im sorry.  AAH! and we cut jessies bihawks off. OH NOOOO! They were so cool. But now her hair looks really cute. She looks like a cute little european girl. I mean... NO! NO BIHAWKS! i wish i could make anything look good the way jessie does. I mean... seriously. How fucking rediculous would i look with bihawks/short hair/spikes/anything. She can pull anything off. Shes so cute.  So we went into town, and we hung out with emily and dave and jessie and dylan and rita and we walked around the creek fest and sat in love sacs and sky chairs for a long time. I like dave. He seems like a non-asshole and hes interesting and... yay jessie! im excited for you. but hes SOOO short. lol. thats ok, jessies short too.  i miss dylan! he was all tired today and non-active and i just wanted to run around and tackle him and go crazy.  im trying to talk on the phone and write this at the same time.. and its difficult. So... bye.  ~abby
