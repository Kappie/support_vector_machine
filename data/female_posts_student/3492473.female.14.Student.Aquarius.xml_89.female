Ate, went online, read Tom Sawyer...all that fun stuff. Tom Sawyer isn't that bad but I'd rather be reading other books. You know what I mean? I didn't really do anything today. I still have to do my crunches. I'm waiting for Margaret to get home so we can watch Uptown Girls. At 10, I'm gonna watch Newlyweds and the Ashlee Simpson show. Exciting life don't ya think? I'm kinda disappointed that it's the last espoidse of the Ashlee Simpson show. I really liked it. But oh well. I guess all good things eventually end, right? I feel like shit. I dunno why. I keep getting really cold and then really warm. My head feels like everything is moving around. My throat is sore. Not as bad as the last few days though so that's good. My chest is a little tight so my breathing is just a little difficult. Uh, I wanna eat but I'm not even hungry. My mom got this ice cream with cake chunks and sprinkles, it seems good and I wanna try it but it's like I have no cravings. And it's like the last day I can eat junk food so I should eat it! And I'm so confused about this one situation. Maura knows exactly what I'm talking about. One minute everything is good and the next everything is about someone else. I know I'm not making sense. But let's just put it this way,  I don't like playing games!  I might write later. I'll put in a poem sometime soon. I'm out~
