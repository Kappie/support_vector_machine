I have been thinking about joining the peace corps.  Last week I had this very interesting dream and I have been so happy ever since.  I have always felt like I have been settling because I really didn't know what I wanted.  I had my sister interpret the dream (yes, my sister interprets dream  she has a physic) According, to my sister the dream I had meant that I have had an eyeing opening experience and I can get to where I want to be if I keep trying.  I don't want to get into the specific of the dream, because it was really weird. Well anyway, for some reason I started thinking about the Peace Corps, I have been researching it like crazy. I am going to check out some meetings this summer in Minnesota, or Chicago.  I really have my heart set on going to Africa.  When I told Carl(my live in Boyfriend) he just laughs and shrugs his shoulders "Like you could ever do without shopping". That just makes me want to do it even more.  Ever since I've had this dream I see the road I have to take to get to where I want to be.(Without sounding too corny)  It's going to take some sacrifices, but I really think it will be worth it. After that I want to move to London. Weird I know, but for some reason my heart is set on moving there too. It will take a long time, but I just feel like I am working towards something. I haven't really worked towards anything in 5 years. It's just living pay check to pay check and finding another dumb job just to pay the bills. As soon as I graduate I will have something to start a career right?? I Hope so...
