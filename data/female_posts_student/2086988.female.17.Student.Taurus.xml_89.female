So I found out from Lanni that Tyler didn't die instantly...You know, I think from what all I heard today from Lanni, it has finally hit me. I just wanted to start crying during class. It's so hard to just go outside and see what a pretty day it is and realize that Tyler, Austin, and Matt will never see any of this again...It just seems to be on my mind alot, like I'll think about everything that has happened and just forget my surroundings. Like today, I was sitting at a red light, just thinking and the other light from under the bridge was green and I was not paying attention and I nearly just went out in oncoming traffic. And yesterday, I pulled out in front of this car that was 6 feet away going about 50 mph, it freaked me out so much, I started shaking so bad that I was swerving a bit in the other lane. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I could forget about all of this, or at least turn back time and prevent it. But, I can't and it sucks.   Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted
