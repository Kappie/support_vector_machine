A hippie.  here are the stereotypical symptoms(I have placed an asterisk beside the traits I exhibit. the more stars, the more hippie!): ***vegetarianism **liberalism and antiwar ideas **antiamerican sentiments *feminism ***long straight hair or weird hair in general *all organic (this can include anything from food to natural looks, i.e. no make up) PETA *the constant wearing of sandals and/or birkenstocks **loose clothing,grunge, and vintage drugs ****disinterest in material possessions *****listen to hippie music---seventies bands, punk rock in which the musicians scream about how much they hate politics, bjork....you get the idea expresses interest in strange and artzy recreational activities-yoga*****,art******,poetry,philosophy,*reading the communist manifesto(I AM NOT A COMMUNIST),***being extremely interested in politics, AND *PARTICIPATING IN PROTESTS(boycott taco bell! support tomato pickers!). odd vocabulary: uses the words "man" and "dude" frequently ***lack of religion or a recent switch to a nonchristian religion  as you can see, i have evolved into a large hippie turd. I attribute this horrible transformation to the ib program and also the art department. Perhaps maybe some friendly influence as well. Although my newfound hippie freedom is all good and fun, i worry that i may not survive in the real world, given that i am not interested in anything practical. How will i make money to buy my precious insulin and food with a low glylcemic  index? How will i keep my diabetic feet? i wouldnt want to end up a homeless art major, i wouldnt last. after consuming my crown of daisies the diabetes would kick in; i would die of high blood sugar, and then the other hobos would roast the sweet meat of my carcass over a flaming garbage can. i must avoid this horrible fate by finding a happy medium...an equilibrium between artistic turd and conservative bitch...i will begin with the easiest thing, a haircut.
