I've been downloading David Gray, Christy Moore, and various piper corps to listen to in the background between my omnipresent jazz.  I do this several times a year when varying waves of homesickness hit.  That sounds strange, I would imagine, to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  But home is not the place of my birth where I was raised.  Home is Edinburgh and Scotland and the craggy beauty of the Highlands.  I wasna there long in the grand scheme of things, but I swear it got into my blood.  Or my ancestral roots were wakened there.  The call of my soul found echo there and I've never been the same since.  I speak often of moving back to Scotland someday, as this is a desire held deeply in my heart.  And depending upon his mood and whether he wants to humour me or not, my husband Murphy says that we shall when we can afford it.  But I know my husband.  He is a true homebody.  He gets upset at the prospect of leaving the state, let alone the country, no matter how much he enjoyed visiting me when I lived in Edinburgh.  Unless we miraculously end up filthy rich so that we can afford all the transatlantic flights home to visit family, I know he'll never do it.  At least not before his parents pass.  And as that is a long while coming (and certainly not a wished for occurence!)  I shall have to feed my homesickness with books and music and pictures and my writing.  But someday...SOMEDAY, I shall live there again.  And I shan't feel out of my skin all the time, as I do now.    Sassenach  is Gaelic for an outlander or foreigner and that's what I feel where I'm supposed to be at home.  Strange, is it no?  When I came back from living there, I hadna so much picked up the accent as the inflections and slang.  People kept looking at me strange here, knowing that how I was speaking was somehow  off  but unable to pin down exactly why.  And of course everyone thought I was a loon for saying "Cheers." all the time, which means "Thanks and goodbye" over there.   Every now and again, that way of speaking will pop back out of my mouth without my thinking.  Particularly if I've been watching a movie or something with accurate accents.  Or listening to a well read book on tape, as I am now.  Diana Gaboldon's  Outlander  (which is likely why I've got it on my mind).  It's a fantastic book, whether interested in Scotland or not.  I highly recommend all of her work.   Back to the grindstone I suppose.  Yours, Maggie
