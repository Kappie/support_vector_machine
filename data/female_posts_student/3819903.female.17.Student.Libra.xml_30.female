I definitley was in the mood to watch some hott men battle it out in a sweaty, muscle-aching, moaning and groaning after every shot-tennis match! Damn, I guess the overview had to do!  Oh Well, the US Open's in 2 months... I can drool over Andy Roddick then!  So then as I sat in agony, watching the overplayed match of Sharapova vs. Williams( for the 4th time thank you) I decided, "wow, its 3:00 in the Afternoon, guess I should get movin on with the day."  Now as I hop in the shower, the father is breathing down the neck about us being to the grandmas on time (god, like it's worth seeing the 24 cousins for the second day in a row...uhh NO), saying, "hurry up kaity...we're leaving in ten minutes without you if you dont hurry up!"  God in my head I'm thinking..."does he not remember that he bought me a car in febuary so I could drive myself places, and waste my own gas...why the hell are they waiting for me, I'll drive myself for Christ Sake!"  So as I told him that that black little escort out there is mine, and I will meet them there, he kind of looked at me with this dumbfounded face- this face that you could read so well- that had the expression of...oh my god thats right, my daughter totally just told me off, and she was right!  God I love that!  So I arrived a half hour after they did, to the white house on Church St., and said hello to grandma, whom I saw 18 hours prior to this greeting, and moved on inside to hang with the 2 oldest kids there-my brother and my sister!  No Joke! I'm 17, Bro's 14, and the Sis is 12.  Wow, I could've done that at home!  Almost worth the waste of Gas!  Of Course, we're the first ones there, even with all the hassle before, of "hurry up, we're gonna be late," so we sit...and watch T.V...(can't go outside, its raining)...and we find a movie on HBO, ah...OLD SCHOOL!  Nothing says Independence Day, like Will Ferrell's Ass!  Well as I sit, watching it for the second day in a row, with the father and uncles telling me, (the oldest remember), to get out of the room during the blow job scene, i stare off to space thinking...My freshman brother is sitting right next to me, he's younger, why the hell am I getting told to leave?!  God, I just keep telling myself...2 months, just 2 more months and I'm gone!   So I left the house, a good 2 hours after I arrived, and found my friends, whom were waiting to grill out with me before the fireworks.  We cooked some amazing hamburgers and weiners at kate's House, cause the parentals weren't home...wow, dont leave Kate alone with a match and a grill...she would most likely blow herself up, she almost did!  then we attempted to watch the fireworks at the church on Madison...but it was sooo damn buggy and wet, that we stayed for like 10 minutes! Oh well!  Then the head ache kicked in...Damn allergies!  I fucking hate the Mold!  Gets my head stuffed up, and it poundin'! Ah..the exciting part of tomorrow should be the 12 o'clock softball game with Kevin's Brother, Mike, and his Firends.  Who should include...Andy Latus, Derek D'Amico, Mike davis (of course), shit, this should be a hott game!  Like 25 hot guys who are 3 years older!  Hell Yeah bitches!  hahahaha  kate and I are gonna be in LaLa land!  Oh my god, and greenman should be there too!  HAHAHA  what a blast!  Ok, well that was my semi active day! maybe it'll be a bit more interesting tomorrow...wink!
