I am smart. Beautiful. Funny. Full of energy. I am unstopable. No man or woman can get in my way. I am indominable. I am unbeatable. I am a rock. No, a tiger. Something great. These are days that everybody has. Not everyday, mind you, but they are there. I am not sure where they com from. What starts or inspires them. But these come and go.  And, oh, do they ever go.  Then there are the other days. Bad days.  Really  bad days. Days when I want to crawl up and die except I know you cant because something else will most likely go wrong to stop me before I get the chance. I feel like dirt. No...I am dirt. I am lower than dirt. I am the dirt that dirt refuses. I am dirt's invisible cousin. I am slow. I am lazy. I am ugly. No, hideous. No...repulsive. I am dumb. Useless. Untalented. And I've forgotton those other days. Those good days. Those days when I feel special. Maybe I haven't  really  forgotten. Perhaps I simply refuse to remember. These days are but a blur...fluttering in and out of my concsious thoughts. Did I feel that way? Is that even possible? Me? Confident and beaming? No. I don't beleive it. I refuse to beleive it. But I must. I mean, it happened, didn't it? Why, I didn't beleive then that I could feel like I do now. And boy, do I now.  For too long that is. Too long have I felt like I do right now. I must change. I must become what I used to be. No. I will become more than that. I will be a superb human being. I will be unstoppable like a rock. Or was it a tiger? But...no. That won't happen. Sure, it's happened before. But this is  now . I can't be that. I could never be that. I don't think I ever was. No! I was. I remember, I think. But...no. Perhaps it will come to me. It has come to me before, hasn't it? If it doesn't I will die. Wouldn't that be nice? No! I can't think like that. It's bad for me. Bad for my mind. My image. I must be positive. Oh...but it's just so hard. I cant be like that. that girl. That girl wasn't me. That was a stranger. A confident, happy, energetic stranger. The kind of person I see on the street and think, "I wonder why she's so darn happy." She is radiant. Radiant. Yes, thats the word. She is radiant. She? Why the third person? Isn't this me I'm talking about? Why...I  an  radiant. Or I could be. No...no that couldn't be. That's the stranger. Yet...I feel as though that should be me. That I should be the radiant one. Yes...I am radiant. I am smart and powerful. Beautiful. No, not beautiful. Pretty is being generous enough as it is. No! I must be as positive as I can possibly be. I  am  beautiful. And nobody can make me think otherwise. And I am respected. People respect me. And treat me with dignity. I am important. And none can say otherwise. Me. Me! Important. Little nobody me. I am. I believ I am. No. I  know  I am. I dont need to beleive in something that I know that is true. It's already there. There in front of me. It is a fact. Faye...that is my Name.  Faye. Respected. Important. Beautiful. Smart.  Yes. Yes that is it exactly.       No. No who am I kidding myself?  I am  NOBODY        Yet...
