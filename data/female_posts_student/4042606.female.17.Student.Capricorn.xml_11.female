Well, as I was walking back down the sidewalk, I noticed a old man facing one of the baby tree's that were growing along the sidewalk. Unfortunately I realized what the old man was actually doing. He was urinating all over the tree. I am aware that nature calls, but, there was a bathroom right inside Hannafords, and also not right in the middle of public viewing. Later, it was brought to my attention that this old man should be allowed to piss where he wants because he is old. Yet, I am not allowed to piss in someones closet on account of revenge.   This world is clearly a little off
