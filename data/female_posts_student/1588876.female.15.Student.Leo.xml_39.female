My friend, who's ID i will keep secret for fear of my life, told me about this other dude, ross, who's in her comp lit class and today i found out that he was vocals/guitar for chloroform. i've spoken to a different Ross (Ross Herring- never met him personally) once online, but that was short lived. then i was formally introduced to this Ross (Ross McLeron) at the library during my comp lit period. tall guy.  i spoke with adam today and pretty much caught up on the current events in our life. talked about chris and such.  speaking of chris, i spoke with him on the phone twice (when i told adam this his eyebrow went up and gave me an, "oooh" b/c i had this stupid little infatuation with him in 7th grade), and we're planning on seeing school of rock together with mel.   and speaking of mel, mum is finally speaking with the family again and now we dont have to intricately plan when and where we're going to meet up to avoid conffrontation b/t the sisters (my mom and hers). oh frabjous day!  by the end of each week, i am so tired. i am as spent as a billion dollars in michael jackson's pocket.  you know, i am so flattered...yet have an awkward feeling. i have had 3 guys already tell me im cute. im flattered b/c they think im pretty, and i feel awkward b/c i never used to appeal to any guys before and i guess im not used to it. all my friends are so pretty and i always felt like i was always in their shadow while they were exchanging  screen names with some hot guy. i guess im "blossoming". but not in the sense of you know, boobs. got those a long time ago. im blossoming in the sense of attractiveness. not just physical, but personality-wise. im more happy i guess. i feel a lot happier in high school.
