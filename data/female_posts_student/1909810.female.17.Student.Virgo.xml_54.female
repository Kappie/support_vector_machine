It kinda sucks because we won't have peace until after christmas break now, and I like being there, I have people to talk to :) and it's nice.  Although I haven't become extremely close to a lot of the people there, there are some who I have. And Barb wants to have coffee with me :) yay, that's always nice, she's good to talk to.  I've taken a couple of really long naps today, but I am still tired, my parents went and got a tree, it is not decorated yet.  I have to study for a chemistry test this weekend, I'm so screwed, it's just so fucking hard I should have never taken that damn class. Grrr. And I have to finish a book for a book review in english, and I have to finish the hobbit, because I never finished it and we were supposed to.  I have to do a shit load of math, god damn it! oh well, i get to go shopping for the adopt a family people tomorrow, we've already bought them 4 bikes(they are only children so it didn't cost all that much) I'm excited, these kids have nothing.  We wanted a family of 4, we got a family of 5 kids.  We expected them to want toys and clothes, and they did...but they also wanted bikes and a nintendo and such, and we can't exactly afford all of that so I am not asking for anything this year, I would be happier if they got what they wanted rather than me just get a few material items that I don't even need.
