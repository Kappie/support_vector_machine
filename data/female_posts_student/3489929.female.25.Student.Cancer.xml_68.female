I am so torn. I really want to take advantage of this, but I want to stay here.  Now I have to see what Montevallo is willing to offer. I have to contact Financial Aid tomorrow and do a comparison. It might be better, considering I would save an out-of-state fee.  BTW: Jefe loved his tie and wants me to find another one. Oookay.
