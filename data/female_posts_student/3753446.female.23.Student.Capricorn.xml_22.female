As of February 18, 2002.   i realized that in this minibio, I have yet to actually put much about my biographical info. So here it is.  Sanjida is known to sleep little, talk much, and be so busy that people have asked her if there are two of her on campus. Sanjida was born in Cincinnati, OH and has lived in Ohio for the majority of her life. She is a junior at CWRU, double majoring in Biochemistry and Psychology. She intends to pursue an MD/PhD in neurology/neuroscience once she graduates in 2003. Currently she does independent research at Louis Stokes VAMC on an antipsychotic drug called Risperidone (Risperdal, commercially). Sanjida has worked actively with CWRU's Muslim Student Association and Muslim Campus Outreach group since 1999. She has further been involved with several Muslim youth groups, camps and seminars since high school. At CWRU, she is also a Resident Assistant in a dorm building, and a Teaching Assistant for an introductory biology lab. In addition, she has been president of CWRU Intercultural Dialogue Group for a year now. In her "spare time," she likes to volunteer at UH and the Free Clinic, play violin, go shopping with her sisters, listen to all kinds of music, write poetry, paint, watch movies, and take long walks with friends.
