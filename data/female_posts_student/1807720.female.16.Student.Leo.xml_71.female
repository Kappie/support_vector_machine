Then in CALM Stephan kept asking me "how do I do this...how do I do that?" and he kept saying "tell me the answer."  It drove me up the wall and well I feel like all my effort is just being used by other people.  For now on, even if I may come across as rude I really have to learn to say no.  There is a point to cross the line, and there is also a point where the line should not be crossed at all.  The chem test was soooo hard today.  I had confidence though, and I practiced and studied for a million hours.  I even reviewed at lunch time.  I am not too sure how I did but I know that the test sure was hard.  I do deserve a good mark though.  I deserve a very good mark.  If I have to rate myself I would give myself an A+ for effort and working and trying so hard.  I deserve it.   Oh and me and chels almost got hit by a car today.  We were crossing at the cross walk and there were cars stopped for us and like another car went by in the other lane and was speeding I am pretty sure and I suppose they didn't see us or something or they just didn't want to stop.  A car that was stopped honked the horn and me and chels turned around and the car was like right behind us.  Literally like an inch.  What a day!  A close encounter with death kind of, and well it actually made me think that well you never what will happen so we should live life the fullest.
