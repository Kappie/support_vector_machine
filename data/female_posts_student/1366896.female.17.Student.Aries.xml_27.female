ZERO. i guess i'm really guilty for not making the effort of staying in contact even though i'm always the one whining that i miss 4s2 this much and that much. believe it or not. something in me just makes me feel so insecure. what is my status in your hearts now? do you guys think of me as much as i think of you? do i even exist? these thoughts keep flooding my brain even though my heart knows that you people really care. that's why i can never seem to be able to blog or do anything properly because i feel that even if i did, you all wuldn't even give a damn. and hell i'm so utterly wrong! you all do care! and it's refelcted in the tags! and only then am i able to once again realise that i do have many precious friendships in singapore... just that i keep forgetting they exist! so it isn't your fault now that i feel like i don't exist, but my own fault that i forget that you all exist! what a weakling i am! to fall under such mediocre pressure. i feel so sorry for everyone of you who takes the effort to think of me.. 'cos i'm the one guilty of not remembering you. thanx guys for your care and concern, it really means LOADS to me. love you.
