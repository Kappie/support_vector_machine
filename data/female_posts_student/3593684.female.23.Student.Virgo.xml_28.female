Not sick as in: cough cough, itch in the back of the throat, snot dripping down,  but sick as in: feeling a little queasy, a little clammy, a little ill at ease  like I'm always nervous, or shakey, or suffering from low blood sugar or nicotine deprivation.  But it's none of those things.  It's love sickness.    Not love sick as in: ohhh I miss him so much, ohh I can't live without him but love sick as in: I can't hardly see straight because I am so irrationally angry at him (david) and everytime I play his fucking CD I want to drive off the side of the road or ram my car into a cement wall.    Or maybe love sick as in: Why can't I just leave him (rod) alone?  I know I am only going to cause more pain in the end, but he is so fucking cool and everytime he e-mails me, my heart feels as if it will explode because my pulse is racing so fast.  I am so confused I can't even type.  I feel like my thoughts are going so fast that I am getting motion sickness.  Maybe that's what this is.  Motion sickness.  I'm sick of all the back and forth, the uncertainity.    Well there are twenty three days until the last day of the month, and guess what day of the week that is?  It's a mother-fucking-sunday.  The last day of the month.  I don't even know if Shaniea, sahnei, shana, whatever, will be gone by then.  But I hope so.  I hope david makes up his wishy washy mind.    I hope I make up my mind.  I hope I can get my act together and clean up.  what a fucking mess.  it's hard for me to understand what rod ever saw in me.  or david for that matter.  fuck this.
