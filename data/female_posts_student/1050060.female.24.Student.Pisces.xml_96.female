I go to visit my mom everyday. So that takes a bit of my time. I always have things to do and i don't seem to find time to write. But i promise things will get better by the end of this week and i will write more often. What's new? well other then my mom being sick there nothing new. I am currently looking for a job. I am hoping that i will be working by May. For all of those who pray please say a little prayer for me and for my mother. Well i better get some sleep. Have a good day!
