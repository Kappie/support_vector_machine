Gosh, I'm feeling fantastic and never really though I'd be doing so well with this.  However, a group that I'm in called  urlLink Put Down The Dount  is starting a 'Bahama Mama Challenge' until the New Years.  I've joined it, only because I feel myself lacking in some areas of Dr. Hruska's program!  I stoped walking for about 2 or 3 weeks due to the hernia on my stomach - What a freakin lame ass excuse!   Although, I've started writing down everything I eat - Just to keep an eye on how much protein and calories I'm actually eating everyday!  And I'm back to walking 2 miles a day! Trying to get more in but taking it a day at a time, so I don't break the habit again.  Other then that life is good! :-)
