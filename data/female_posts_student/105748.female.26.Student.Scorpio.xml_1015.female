As far as TechTV, I certainly hope that Ching and Brain are learning the ins and outs of the computer world.   Sad to say, I have stopped being an avid watcher of TechTV due to the fact that they booted  urlLink Chris Pirillo  from  urlLink his   urlLink show  and also the way the producers have slowly filled the network with crappy new shows rather than technology info in the last 8 months.  But dont let my boycott ruin your fun,  enjoy  urlLink Call for Help  and  urlLink The Screensavers  while you still can.
