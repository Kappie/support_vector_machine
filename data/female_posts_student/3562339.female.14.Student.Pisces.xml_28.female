It took 2 and a half hours in all. I even polished it and my hands smelt like orange oil afterwards. Then Alicia came to sleep over because she couldn't get a ride over tomorrow.      This morning, we watched  Life or Something Like It  with Angelina Jolie, and left for the train station at 1:30. The train didn't come till 2, grrrrr. But at the train station we met these crazy, yet nice,people from Harriton. Then this weird homeless man came up to us after Alicia complained about the rain. He was like, you are blessed with whatever weather there is and that you should respect your parents and so on. I couldn't understand half of it considering that he had a really strong Jamaican accent, and it was slightly scary.      Then we finally got on the trian, and we were slightly afraid that we would miss our stop, Market East. But of course we didn't because I would never let us do that. Heh. Then we walked like at least 15 blocks to get to South Street. -_-. Bleh. Then we found the store Guacamole surprisingly. That's the store that sell Floaties, and the only reason we went to Souf Street is to buy Floaties. Actually, that was Alicia's reason. My reason was to meet up with Jimmi, but he couldn't get a ride from Kutztown. Grrr. Then we kind of wasted away another hour because we were getting picked up at 4, and didn't even get there until around 3. And it started raining within the first 20 minutes and didn't stop. Bleh. But we didn't get THAT wet, only completely. We kind of just ran between stores, and played cards in Starbucks.      After my dearest father picked us up, we went to Pat's Steaks, which are totally better than Geno's for any people who ever doubted it. Pat's literally invented cheese steaks, and even Alicia admitted that they were very good. It was her first time there, surprisingly enough. Alicia has a thing against South Philly, or all of Philadelphia to be more exact. She's kind of right behind me at the moment commentating on what I write. That's about it for the moment.      *headbangs to the Ramones*      ...la Gu
