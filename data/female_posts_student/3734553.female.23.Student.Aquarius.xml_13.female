Because so many aid groups have pulled funding, the price of rice, the main staple in a Guinean diet, has skyrocketed.  But there is no rice to sell anyway.  It has been reported that there are cargo ships off the coast, but they won't unload until they are given the money promised by the govt.  Problem is there is no money because of the corrupt govt. Officials, 88 of which have been fired. Evan and I joked around before he left about how all he was going to eat was rice and mangos.  I guess he is left with just mangos now.  Many families are having one meal every two days.  You can find the article at ABC News on-line.    i have had some crazy dreams lately.  Other than that I am just getting ready to move.
