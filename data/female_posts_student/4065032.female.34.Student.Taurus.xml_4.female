I must admit that the thought of strangers, and even friends, reading my blog leaves me feeling a bit cautious. Likeall works of art, the lines and images are always left for interpretation. For each pair ofinvestigating eyes comes as many, if not more, theoretical "understandings" of the spirit that drives the artist. Perhaps, with luck, I, too,will begin to learn who I am; I will begin to trust myself; and I will begin to see me as the same person I dream to be. With that said, welcometo the perceptions ofmy journey through the Iowan fields of opportunity.
