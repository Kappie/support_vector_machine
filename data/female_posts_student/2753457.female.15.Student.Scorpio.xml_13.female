My clothes were even pinker than they are normally, and you know how pink I get.  My carnation is still in the Fosters water bottle from lunch.  It likes it in there, and perked up considerably during C and C.  I have "The Way You Move" in my head, particularly the part that's like "But I know y'all wanted that 808, can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass, but I know y'all wanted that 808, can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass."  Hahaha, yeah I do. My dad just called to see if I had plans.  I told him not yet.  He wants to have dinner.  Told me to get the chicken out of the freezer and put it in the sink.  Whoooooo, sounds like some bonding time over the grill ensues. I'm reeeeeeally bored.  And tired.  I may go to sleep, to make the time pass more quickly. Ewwww, that awful video from The Darkness that's in space is on Music Television.  Sorry if you like that song, but to me it sounds like a bunch of vocal jumps in a row (a sixth interval, to be precise).  "Touching you-oooo."  Why are they in space anyway?  It's like the "Larger than Life" music video from the Backstreet Boys.  Well, our song has NOTHING to do with being in space, but we love to spend money, so we're gonna be cool robot people at the space station!!  Stupid boy band. Now Cribs is on.  That one's even stupider.  Hey, look!  I'm really rich, and oooh, poor you, you're not.  Oh, well, here's my frivolously huge pool on the roof!  Ughhh, changing the channel right now. Anyone know what the deal is exactly about tomorrow??  I gotta call people about this.  No one's online.  Sad.
