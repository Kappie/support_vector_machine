When we think about the way things work, the flow of everything, we are able to see the gifts that wash up on shore.    I have seen the dawn for the second time in as many months.  Maybe I need to begin staying awake for it more often as the light that comes then is clear and about birth.  There is an awakening in that moment, despite the exhaustion that you feel, despite the long walk through chill night air, in that moment of warmth we are able to have. Have what?  Have the moment, and it becomes everything that we need.  When our mind is cleared of the chaos and turning of too many street lights, when we forget the smell of herbal brews and honey, when everything is lost it is not a loss at all- it is a becoming of now.    Is it that I look for proof of god, or is that god is always offering up proof?  Is it that I am walking the right path, or does the right path move under my feet?  When there is a kiss, is it the lips giving, the neck receiving?  Or is the neck giving, and the lips receiving?  Do these questions matter?  No.  They don't, because they can be contradictions, and they can both be true.  Why do we insist on these binaries which pull us away from simple seeing?  The path is moving and I am walking.  The proof is offered, and yes, I am looking.   After nights of wandering sans thought, after nights that are too filled with thought to be considered thoughtful, after nights of tight tension pulling on chest and groin, then I am empty, and free to start again in this clean sight.  It is a sight washed free of dirt- and these times come back when we are most ready to receive them, otherwise they are simply confusion, simply sleeplessness, simply tired.  When we welcome these nights, they give us new eyes.  When was the last time that you had such a night, and even with the weight of  heavy things undone sitting on your shoulders everything stood out?  When was the last time you danced the fine line of dawn, giving in once you were sure that a new day and life was going to come back, crashing down, sitting down around you with unfriendly looks that made you laugh in a half quiet mad way?  You floated in those moments of stolen sleep.  You moved through the day with a slight ache in your muscles, recalling.  You wondered at gifts, even as they fade and drift away, and are utterly content with this- because it was, and you were there fully, holding it without fear of future and past.  You had no chance to make it permanent- there were too few moments in which to dream, and nothing in your mind could settle, and thus it becomes a continuous dream, and constant moment, which floats and returns in a third eye gasp of recognition of the divine entering into everyday moments to tweak them to perfection.    There is nothing to think about, nothing to process, nothing to consider, because you entered this space with nothing wanting, nothing lacking, because you had gone through the rituals you needed, traveled through the dark spaces, talked to all the demons and dined with all the wraiths, you had cleaned out all the forgotten trash, washed your hands in lemon rose water, sat down in silk and considered the meaning of impermanence, you had talked about the way water forms eddies, and how that is bigger and prettier then just a rock under the glazed liquid, you had been cut and had pink lines running along your skin in all the sacred symbols that you didn't even knew you knew when you began, and you remembered how to breath in light without hesitation, and then you stepped over the marker that creates a gap between consciousness and death, and then you were ready to begin.
