Wow, I haven't had my nails done since Ed and I got married in the church...this was a nice treat.  I was watching the eighth grade families play together.  They had a parents against students game.  It was nice to see, I hope Bailey's new school is as wonderful as St. Mary's.  I am so sad to leave this school because we have been with them for so long.  =(  It is all about new beginnings though and we are just grateful to have found a new school.  Bailey is an exceptional person and I know he will adapt well and do great...it is just mommy we have to worry about...haha  Well that is all I can think of for now..no random rambling for today.  I have far too much packing and getting ready to do.  Bay Area, here we come...should be exciting because Ed's family hasn't really met Emily Love.  They are just going to love her...she is just too darn cute.  She would give people great reason to want to clone...haha  I will talk to you all later...I know you are going to miss me the 3 days I am gone...nothing to read online to put you to sleep.  haha
