Then came the eerie silence that seemed to whisper in its wake, I don’t know what happened but I felt the goose bumps all over again.   Just to separate my mind from all the horror its trying to conjure, I welcomed the voice of Josh Groban as he sang in my DVD. Again, I was in love.   His rendition of “Broken Vow” reminded me always of Mindoro, not that there was a person in Mindoro who broke some vow, but of the stillness of the sea in Ensalada, and the breathtaking beauty of the place and its inhabitants. Whenever I need a place to recuperate from all the stress, I think of Puerto Galera and of the things I experienced there. From way back in UP-Manila when we had our emersion in “Gale”, then of our escapades when we joined the Remontados.   Hay naku Chin, those were the glorious days we shared together…remember Charlie? I wonder what happened to him, he’s probably taking his Masters Degree abroad…what do you think? Text me if ever Grace contacts you…and of course Angge. Asan na kaya ang bruha?  Well, I just hope that we’ll be able to do those excursions again, maybe in a year I could grab some time off from school, maybe during affiliation, before going back here to the province we could go straight to Puerto Galera, even for a couple of days. And of course, bring Francis…pwede ba naming hindi.  I do wonder sometimes, what could have happened if I stayed there and gotten a job in Manila…hmmm…that’s a thought.
