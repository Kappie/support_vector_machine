To the TAGBOARD VIOLATORS: no cursing --- puhleeeese!  NET: I thought TSS stood for Toxic Shock Syndrome?  I am so clueless!  DAF: We just saw Pierce Brosnan in  Die Another Day .. I'm with Kim on this one.  He's still very hot!  p.s. You really need to watch Smallville, DAF!  The Chloe that I'm talking about is the one in Smallville.  She has a crush on Clark, who has a crush on Lana (BTW NET, it's Lang).. It's a bit of a love triangle and an amusing one at that!
