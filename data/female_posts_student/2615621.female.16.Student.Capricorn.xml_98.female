Oh, i went on this hot date with 2 guys. Ben and Jerry. OMG FANTASTIC! They hit just the spot...:p we sat around eating cookie dough ice cream and watching Bicentennial man and crying tears when Andrew didnt live to hear he was a human...  Today i called my family back home and talked to one of my bros and mom. Mom is excited about going to hondorus. like i predicted earlier in blogs, im not going, and she and her boyfriend are. i told her to buy me something vuitton again and she laughed and said "haha maybe" which means "yes, because i realized what a bitch ive been in the past and now that ur actually gone, i miss you and should have never said half the shit ive said to you" It's funny how people show their love..somehow with me, its always to my back. oh well, i might get a new purse or something outta it. i really want the S-Lock bracelet in the rainbow pattern. :D that would be nice. hahaha   Also, in the phone call, she decided she was going to tell me about my grandfathers health. He's having some heart trouble all of the sudden. He works out everyday, is extremly active, practially has a gym in his house, hes 70 and only semi-retired..and now he can hardly make it up whe stairs without having to sit down. and he has 4 "spells" during one nite. "spells" meaning heart trouble. his heart starts suddenly racing or something, i dont know. I worry about him. How can someones body go from healthy to all the sudden crippling? i dont understand. Most people are like "its ok...ur mom said it wasnt too serious, and this happens to a lot of older people" yeah. but..i still dont believe everything is ok. My granddad is the only one ive known my whole life and hes the smartest man i've ever met. He's patient, i've never heard him cuss (actually, hes never cussed before, execpt saying "damn" when he fell off a horse), ive never heard him yell, and he knows everything there is to know! hes so smart. I know i've complained about driving with him. i hate driving with him! He talks nonstop about how ur not driving right haha. but honestly, i'd give anything to be driving down the road right now with him. My granddad and i have the same birthday, and i cant imagine having a birthday without him there. i mean, one day, i will...but not anytime soon. The thought that things could get worse for him have made me cry all day. When mom told me i instantly had tears running down my cheeks..but i didnt give in to that i was crying. I called to tell him happy fathers day and he wasnt home, so i left a message on the machine, thank god, cuz i would have prob busted out crying when he picked up. Nothing makes me want to go home more. I wish i could go home now actually..just the thought of loosing him makes me want to make sure just incase if anything was to happen, that i would have time...time is all i want. but isnt that what we all want? more time. some people are never on time, others are always on time, some people want less time, others want more time...it's all about time. That statement could be taken many diff ways. take it how u want.   *much love and spring daisies*
