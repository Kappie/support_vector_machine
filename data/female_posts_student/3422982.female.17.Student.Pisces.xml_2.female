And the fact that my depression is still lingering isn't helping.  Cuz with depression comes procrastination ten-fold.  So I'm sitting here thinking about how I should be working on it, but too "lazy" to.  And knowing that I'm going to completely screw this thing up and probably get shit from my teacher is making me sick.  Literally.  I feel queasy.  I wouldn't be surprised if I got sick.  So I've been trying to do things to get my mind off it when I should be working on it!  ARG...  Anyway, I have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow.  I hope they take my braces off.  They could at least take my top ones off!  There's nothing more they can do besides close up those two spaces they made, which can easily be fixed by a retainer, or one of those clear things that go around your teeth.  *sigh*  They will be off before summer, or both Mom and Phil are going to have some nasty things to say to those people.  Hell, even Phil is getting pissed and annoyed.  bah!  I'm off to procrastinate some more, I plan to work on it tomorrow.  Seriously, I will.  You just watch. later dayz
