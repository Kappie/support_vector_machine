Thank goodness. I'm starting to feel better just from getting some actual sleep.  I had marching, "tryouts" both Wednesday and Thursday Yesterday was basics. It wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be, thank goodness. I'm actually kind of glad I stuck with marching, and promised my mom I'd do it. We watched the senior movie with the song, "We Go On," in it. It's a song from my Freshman year show. It always makes me so sad.  Anyway, scariest conversation ever last night. I was talking to Chris, and he's like, "What if I just told you how I really felt about you?"  I started flipping out, because I couldn't tell if he was serious or not, because I couldn't hear his voice, and I was like, "Ah, he's already had a crappy week, how the heck am I supposed to say this nicely."  And, someone asked me later that night, when we were talking about people we like, "Why don't you just go out with Chris?"   I don't think people get that we're just good friends and nothing more. I don't think I could ever go out with Chris. Ever. It'd be way too weird, and...ick. Just...no. No offense to him of course. I mean, he feels the same way, so....people, just...forget it. Chris and I don't like each other, and never will. Well, like as more than friends. I'm just sick of it.  I wish people could realize that just because I have guy friends, doesn't mean I like them, or want to go out with them. I had a conversation with Bryan about it. It's actually really easy to talk to Bryan. I'm glad he's my friend. And no, I don't like Bryan as more than a friend.  Enough said. You get my point. Byebye.
