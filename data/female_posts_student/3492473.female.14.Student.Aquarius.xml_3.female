Since this is my first posting, I'm not gonna get in too deep and talk a lot about the  BIG  stuff in my life...I'll save that for Posting Number  2 ! I'm still getting used to all this "stuff." Right now, I'm waiting for Candy to sign back on and ask her how to fill in my "personal profile" or whatever it's called! Well, I'm off like a prom dress *as my sister says, which makes a lot of sense* to mess around with these setting and maybe figure out how to work some stuff!
