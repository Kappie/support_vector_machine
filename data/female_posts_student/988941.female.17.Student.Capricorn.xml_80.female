I mean, thepeople I care about in the way I think you mean don't care about me in return, someone don't even know who I am or have even heard of me! Now that can get you depressed...or you choose not to be. There are choices everywhere in your daily routine yea? Wheather to get up now or in five minutes, eat this or that, drink this or that, do this or not etc... So if someone doesn'r care for you in return you can either choose to be depressed or choose to be happy and just be glad they are your mate or something. See what I'm saying? And anwsering my own question from earlier: for my honeymoon I'd go on a cruise to the Antartica and my perfect husband? A bit of you-know-who mixed with a bit of you-know-who and then some of you-know-who. Perfect.
