It's hard for us to speak our mind and  make something concrete out of the millions of ideas which is flowing in our neurons..the answer in this question is something that interests me...I really wonder what hinders our courage to move, to speak, to be TRUE...    Consequences, probably this one of the reasons why speaking out is hard for most of us...I think other than the consequences that will come out..Fear is one of the factors which halts us!!     We have this fear of saying things that is out of ordinary..Fear of being secluded because of the miss matched ideas..Fear of offending someone who means so much to us...and this is where the sad part begins..    I wonder how many failed relationships occured just because of our being timid and being silent?..how many familes broke up because of the absence of communication?..how many relationships ceases without even plunging into it, only because of not letting our feelings explode?...     There is really one thing that I have realized..It's importance of expressing our thoughts...letting our grievances flow..letting our mind speak out..and be true to our feelings..   ---and why am i righting this?!!! i don't know...Just wanted to speak my mind---
