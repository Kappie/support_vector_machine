It's pretty nice, actually; if one can ride out the waves of students fresh from class until they all leave for the day, one can actually get a thing or two done!  The thing or two done tonight included reading for tomorrow's Civil Procedure class (the horror!) and Thursday's Criminal Law class (because that day's Contracts reading is already done--Yay.) so as to make room for time to complete the writing assignment's outline due Friday, even though she'll give us until Monday.  Have yet to read the final case (that is sure to change the very nature of said outline) needed for said assignment, so I need all the time I can give myself.  Now I have exactly one hour to get home, change, find my bearings, and get to Yoga.    Hope this morning's black ice hasn't returned now that the sun's finished for the day.  The walk into school earlier was a bit treacherous, as treks across parking lots go.  Black ice on asphalt does not give.  Not even a bit.  And I'm the biggest pussy when it comes to walking on ice and/or snow.  This fact is exacerbated by fellow students cursing along, passing me without a second glance or thought about navigating the new terrain.  They must have no fear of death.  Like Aragorn.    So class participation in Property is our friend.  Had a sneaking suspicion that those points helped my exam score up over the C/B hump, and my professor confirmed said suspicion in our meeting yesterday.  Strictly point-wise, I should have had a C+ on the exam, but my probing, insightful comments in class gave me that extra edge we so love in times of need.  Yay.    Suppose that gives me more leverage in executing Susan's Operation Liberal Countermeasures in every class.  (Aside: wonder if writing case briefs for 2 hours before posting changes the tone/style of blog postings.)
