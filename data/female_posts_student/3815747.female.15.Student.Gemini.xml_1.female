I was in a really bad mood yesterday evening, which usually means I'm prone to arguing and/or debating, so one of my friends from a message board suggested we debate the topic of abortion. He hasn't responded yet, since I only just started the debate this morning, but here is what I've said on the subject:  "I'm slightly torn on the abortion topic. It really depends on the case, in my opinion. If you're an adult, have a stable job, and were just extremely moronic and went and had sex without protection, then you should have the child and deal with it. If you have to, put it up for adoption, but you shouldn't destroy a human life just because you were a moron.  "If a teenager was moronic and had sex without protection, then they deserve to have the child, too. Again, put it up for adoption if you can't handle it, but have the freaking child.  "The last scenario is the one I'm torn on. What if a girl is raped, and becomes pregnant? That's not exactly her fault, so she shouldn't have to birth a child she can't afford. Then again, I'm still against the taking of a to-be-child's life. My two views are: if you absolutely can't afford the child, then do the abortion. If you are able to afford it, have the kid, and then maybe put it up for adoption."  If anybody would like to submit their own views and opinions about abortion, please feel free to do so.
