I love silliness and goofiness. It's great...  Like, yesterday I was in a shitty mood, but not long after I came back to school for  Mockingbird , I was in a great mood... People crack me up.. :) And it only got better from there... And again, today, not in a great mood, but after being around the silliness of the folks there, wow!, good mood!  People are great. Especially, boys... They're goofy :)  I can't wait until 4-H camp... This summer is going to be wonderful!  ...All day it hasn't seemed like a Friday, and it still doesn't... Meh.  One week until exams. Eeep...  But, less than two weeks of school :D  I need sleep... Can you tell? :)
