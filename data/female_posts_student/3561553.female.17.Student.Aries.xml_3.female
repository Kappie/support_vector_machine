My hair may not be perfect,  and I may not fit size 2, but I always feel so beautiful, all because of you.  I know I'm not a model,  and I know I'll never be, but you make me feel so great about  being plain old me.  My waist might not be tiny,  and my arms might not be thin, but somehow you have taught me,  to love the girl within.  If you werent here to love me,  and show me what you see, I wouldnt be this happy,  being plain old me.   [ i love you troy ]
