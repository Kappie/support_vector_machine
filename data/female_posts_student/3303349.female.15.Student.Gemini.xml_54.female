I hate not having him here to talk to when ever I want. Especially since now he is my boyfriend, though I still can't really think of him as my boyfriend because I seem to be registering that as something more impresonal that what I have with him. Though tomorrow is our 3 week anniversary already! I can't belive it's already been that long. Though I realise as I keep this count I am wishing away my summer. Nut oh well. Next year isn't stressing me out right now.  My topic of thought last night was on Paul actually being my boyfriend and how I won't have to be alone any more. *hopefully* I'll always have someone to eat lunch with and go to pep rallies with and all that other good stuff where i am terrified to be alone. So this is exactly what I need considering my fear of people! Ha well this stuff kinda only makes sence in my mind so I'm gonna stop. Tonight I may be able to come up with something deep...
