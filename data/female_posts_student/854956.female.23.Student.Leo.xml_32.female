Technically I'm still not done with World Civ. because I still have the final... but today was the last lecture... and "Good Riddance" comes to mind when I think of that.  Bad news for today... Dr. Davies decided that our World Civ final should be a blue book exam.  Dum Dum Dum!  You know what that means...?  Essays all the way.  We have to identify and critically discuss 6 terms/people/occurences (that's 40% of the final).... The last 60% of the final is one long ass essay over a very broad topic.  YAY!  Let me do my FRIGGIN' happy dance!  :-(  Nein, Nein. Nicht das blaue Buch!  (for all that don't know German... it translates to, "No, no.  Not the blue book!"  Anyhow... and of course I'm worried about my Bio exam.  It shouldn't be too bad, though.  I'm most comfortable with the botany section, and well... that's 2/3 the exam right there.  And I figure for the comprehensive part, I can just study the old exams.  We all have the correct answers, now.  So hopefully all will do well.  As far as my Psych exam... I'm surprisingly not worried at all.  It's the last exam I'll take (On Wednesday)... and we're getting a review... and he's holding a review session on campus Monday night before the exam... so, I think I'll do pretty well on that.  I'm thinking final grades will be... A (Music), B (World Civ), B (Psych), and C (Biology).  Which would give me a 3.0 for the semester.  Which, TRUST ME, I'd be happy with...!!!!  I'm gradually pulling my grade up from when I plumetted to a 2.90 about 3 semesters ago... if I pull off a 3.0 this semester... I'll be sure to have a 3.0 once again... which is of great importance to me.  Anyhoo... I must go now and begin typing my EVIL World Civ paper comparing Jihad and The Crusades.... ACK!      urlLink  postCount('3Dec2002');
