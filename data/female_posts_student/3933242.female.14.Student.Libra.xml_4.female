The oppenent's team were tough.. they are trained in communication.. theycan read one another's mind.Strong... is the oni word i can describle them.For ours... our focus is all shatter apart... i was tryin to keep things in order... I hope to see a miracle.. We worked hard to keep the ball within our side... It was hard.. So it went to the other side fast enough...Den the other team threw their ball from the top of the court .. to the tip of the court.. It was clearly  foUL...  but the referee did not raise any objection... My heart was so much want to debate furiously with the referee.. but I know.. I am at the losing side.. stUuupid.. never mind.. I continuing playing against the opponent...Trying to keep my mind on focus... gRrr.. but whenever the ball was issued to us and one of my team member destroy the opportunity.. I was fumed up and scold the gal on the spot.. and I knew I was wrong.. but I can;t help it...haiz...the first halve ended with 1 - 4... they defeated us terribly... den the secound halve started.. a shot of excitement run through my skin... I started playing.. and again.. from my perpective... they foul without referee having any objection... I was so much wanted to get rid of them.... and the ball fly from here to there.. and they goal... again... 1 - 5.... it was such a embarassment.. we have to buck up... we started working with our mind and body... Coordinating them together...we started with a stragety.. joann and I began to work together... and we pass... here and there .. within our arm lenght.. and shoot...  gOaL!  great .. I thought.. things are seems to be turning.... so we use the same strategy.. and we throw... almost.. almost....  SCORE.. Yes! I thought.. 3 - 5.... we are moving again... I think we are able to catch up... no matter wat..  we mUZ .. deN we started going again.. to Our dismay... our opponent team use their "infamous" shot.. and... it fly.. zoom past the captain... and they failed to get it.. YES!... My heart leap with confidence again... we began playing.. shouting commands... and Jojo and I did our trade mark and pass to Aqrika... and she throw.. Yes..  another goal ... hiPPY... 4 -5... things are working now... with the last few minutes... the oppenent threw the ball .. and unfortunaly.. they goal... 4-6.. to tell ya the truth.. I was losing hope... a few more seconds.. we hope to create a miracle... and gOal.. oh no... NOoooo.... one of the oppenents 's team had slapped the bal; down.. and the game ended...  finalresults 4-6 ... haiz... its okae... wonderful experience though....
