I'm really quite scared about it.    Oh my God.  I'm just talking to Clare, and at first I was gonna be all sarky, then I opened up to her, now I'm just totally ranting.  I'll copy and paste it next time I post, cuz I'm saving it in Word and this conversation will just never end!! We're so totally friends now.  I don't think either of us are talking to anyone else.  It's just soo intense.  Charlotte, though?  Me and Charlo, Charlo and me, we're not speaking :D  I'll paste it in when I next post, if I remember.  I can't be bothered to write any more now.  But I think things are going to get better now (and Clare is soo invited to my party!!)  Hugs and kisses, *~Jools~*
