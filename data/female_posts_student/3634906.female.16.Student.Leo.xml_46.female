WAHH i really think that my dad would adore me having one but who flippin cares i guess if he doesnt want to pay for one then i cant really do anything about it... we'll see maybe my brother will talk him into it... anyways i must be going because i assume i should probably start helping or i am going to get my ass chewed by my mom love gabby
