Guster-Either way-*Lost and Gone Forever*  You were almost kind, you were almost true Don't let me see that other side of you You have learned in time that you must be cruel I'll have to wait to get the best of you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you? Wonder what difference does it make......Either way You were almost kind, you were almost true Why give away that other side of you Happens every time, so it must be true Step on a kid, he'll grow up hating you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you Wonder what difference does it make....Either way Were you ever kind, were you always cruel? Who's ever seen that other side of you? Happened every time, so it must be true? Where did you learn it's either him or you? You were almost kind, you were almost true Don't let me see that other side of you You have learned in time that you must be cruel I'll have to wait to get the best of you Poison in everything you said Don't you, don't you? Wonder what difference does it make......Either way(2x)
