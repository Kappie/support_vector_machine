We're getting a family plan today, after I called T-Mobile twice to assure Dad that no, we're not on contract anymore.  I started packing today. I told Wendy that I couldn't go to Third St. since Mom told me it was an early Father's Day lunch, etc. Guilt-tripping galore, so I decided to put all my clothes into a suitcase just to see how much I needed. I need shorts. Bathing suit is probably a little out there since Wendy's going to USC starting Monday and won't be in town for late-night swims with Nimo and maybe a Lydia in something swim-appropriate. It was such a strange feeling. It was cloudy, and the electronic sounds of the Postal Service made it seem almost surreal. Well, at least I'm not taking up as much space as I thought I would...so far.  Peter and Ellis left today. Wendy's going Monday. Ryan's probably coming back soon for UCLA. Andrew's off to Europe Tuesday. I'm leaving Friday. So I guess we've already burned through that blissful week in limbo and we're off to start our real summers.  Mm, I have to go.
