CURIOSITY.  You walk out of your house and see a huge mob of people crowding around the nearby shopping centre. You want to know what's going on. Is there a flimstar coming to town? Maybe there is a discount sale? Some how your legs subconsciously walk towards the shopping centre. CURIOSITY.  You see your friend writing furiously in a small book. What is he writing? Is that book his diary? You try to take a take a peak. CURIOSITY.  The unknown, the unimaginable, the uncomprehendable. All these trigger this small(ok maybe not that small) something in your brain that urges you to find out more, understand better or just intrude in other people's business. This small something is CURIOSITY.  Curiosity is what develops the thinking mind making the person creative and innovative. Scientists depend on curiosity to drive them to greater heights.  But it is also the very thing that is the root of all gossip.  Curiosity buds off as hot gossip- the unusual need to know details about the lives of others even though gained information is of no valuable use.  Love it or hate it, you have to agree that curiosity is sometimes good; sometimes bad. It all depends on how you make use of it in your life. As always there are no absolutes in the world that we live in.
