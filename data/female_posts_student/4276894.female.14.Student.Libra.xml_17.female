They always want every single detail and they never let me do anything my own way. Anyway, moan over, this is my "blog" and it's just going to have random little things put on it. if you're reading, then you're mad. If you think I'm talking crap, feel free to say so.    A word of advice: Yell At Old People: it's fun. Then you can run away and they'll never catch you. heehee.. clever or what?! Oh yeh, and cry sometimes, even if you're a guy, because crying is fun and it doesn't actually make any sense but it makes you feel good afterwards. However excessive use of this tip can give one hell of a headache and pretty sore eyes.    Also, another cool thing to do if you're feeling really pissed off is write a list of things that are pissing off, this can include people, and then rip it up into little bits and burn it! Then make another of things that will make you feel better and do all of those things, however insane or difficult.    I know I'm probably just going crazy, but who gives a fuck because I'm really, really, really pissed off. If your dad made you hang up to your boyfriend who you weren't gonna speak to for another two weeks even though it's your sixth month anniversary next week, would you be pissed off? If the answer's no, then you're a very tolerant person. Aaaaanyway, must be off, so keep watching the skies, and burning lists and yelling at old peple and crying! woo you might learn something whoooo knows!       Peace
