Friday: we went to Applebee's with Deb, Danielle, Dave, Fea, Melca, Simione, Danny, Melanie and Erica for Deb and my birthdays. Then, we all went back to Fea's and, alert the media, I beat Mick at air hockey! Did you ever think you'd see the day? I didin't.  Saturday: in the morning I woke up early and made pancakes then we hung out the whole day and then at night we went to dinner at Sweet Basil in Annadale. It wasn't that eventful a dinner excpet the whole "set price menu" thing was kinda gay. We'll just fast forward Saturday night, those are not the fondest of memories, but, I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. But I made a cake and that made it all better. Cake makes everything better. Yes... yes it does.  Sunday: that morning I woke up and made French (Freedom) Toast. I swear I get to be such a domestic when he comes here lol. Like, I just wanna cook and do everything for him... ug, its that whole "nurturing" thing I guess. So, then we hung out again durin the day, then at night we were gonna make it a Bockbuster Night but Blockbuster kinda dissappointed us so we just ended up watching Rudy and Old School, possibly 2 of the best movies ever made. Rudy being number one of course ("Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame...."). Sunday night, which was in my oppinion the best night, we had a great time. At around 2 a.m. we just started to get delusional and started naming our body parts and talking in funny voices and things like that. Might sound silly to you but it was really fun to us. Many an inside joke was born... and thank God that was the only thing.. lol juuuuuuuuust kidding.... there was no hanky-panky... well.. not much any ways.  Monday: or as I would like to call it for the duration of this post, D-Day. I kinda ran out of breakfast ideas (sad I know, the only two things I can come up with for breakfast are pancakes and French (Freedom) Toast), so we just skipped it. We got a cab to Brooklyn were we met up with my dad at my grandmas and we ate pizza there and then it was off to the airport.  I felt kinda bad cause like the last hour or so that I was gonna be with him I ended up falling alseep on his lap in the car.   But, then it was time to say goodbye. I dunno, I was really sad and all that, but I know I'm gonna see him again in about a month. It was funny, my mom goes "You should go visit him in April when you have time off." It was such a thank-you-captain-obvious moment that I just wanted to say "Dah." or something.   And... now... I'm just sitting here.... yeah... that's me... hi... how are you? I'm fine, thanks.  On a lighter note, I've decided to go get my hair cut and go shopping tomrrow. MmM MmM Bitch! x0x
