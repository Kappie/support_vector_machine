Me and christine remodeled my room! *lol* makes it sound all dramatic when its not TAHT different, but i like it now, but art work is arranged differently, bed in a diff. space, that typpa thing. Then i headed over to work around 2.  It was fine, fun cuz i was working w/ Alli.  Then to my pleause guess who walked in the door? BRAD!! He brought me panera! yummm! But yeah so we ate and talked a little then he hadta head back to work and the same for me! worked til 830, home watching tv w/ mom, and now its off to bed! MWAHS!
