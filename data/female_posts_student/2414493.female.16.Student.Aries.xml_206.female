I usually associate piano with pain, stress, nerves, etc. But this is the plan for this weekend: I will have no Saturday whatsoever since it's Bach at 1 and then Colburn in the afternoon. Mr. Francis is like, "Oh, I'm going to both places so I could give you kids a ride...and maybe afterwards we can go out for pizza or somehting."  Chika, please tell me you're going too. :)  I remember Cynthia telling me she was the last of the old Francis students and how he used to take them to concerts. And that's all I can think of right now.   To complicate Saturday matters, it's Anatomy sports physicals day. If you're playing something next year, you can get your physical done at Los Robles Saturday morning. But hey, I'm more interested in staying home that morning to practice. I don't want to go.  So this is how you spell Szymanowski. Number three, of course.
