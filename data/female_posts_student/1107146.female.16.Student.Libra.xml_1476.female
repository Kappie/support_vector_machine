I would have gotten it myself..but I can't stand to get it :p Thanks for having us over abby, it was lots of fun :)  Well it was good meeting you guys last night! And no Rosie, no one frightened me. Well..there was that one on one conversation with Abby's mom..but that's another story for another time.  We'll have to do it again sometime soon. Hopefully, I'll get to be part of the movie choosing process and I can meet everyone else.
