I'm ignoring the 'stay away' comments from my friends and really, instead of making me repulsed by the facts I hear, I'm being drawn in. I met this guy named Anthony at a Dave Matthews band concert last month and we really hit it off. Sure he was drunk, but he was really nice afterwards too when he called me. He's everything I really do not need. I lied to me about his grade in his college classes, he has a fake I.D., and he's raunchy... and all the while... I'm  REALLY  attracted to that. Maybe its the fact that I look too much into guys. I expect too much out of them. Those expectations kind of drove away my past relationships. I expected them to do that.. I expected them to do this... and its just got really tiring and boring! I'm in a point in my life where I do want to explore my more fun experimenting side. I'm not saying sleeping with guys and just making out with random guys. I would like to have some sort of fling. Just a fun little... fling! I think I might call this tony guy. just see what happens. I'm ready for some fun.
