I hate how much he's workin now! grr! :) Hopefully we'll still get the chance to hang out though. They're so great. Let's see....did I mention anything in my last entry about *him~? Probably not. Because I hadn't talked to *him~ in quite a while. But it was still great. Well, dad's just about done with the tanning bed. I'll be glad when I can use it. I'm so light and I wanna go fishin with Brad and whoever sometime but I refuse to do it unless I have a LITTLE tan at least. I've gotta go walking too. I'm gonna gain weight sittin around here on the computer all the time and eatin every few minutes. lol. So, I guess about almost half the summers gone by and I've done nothin. Things better start lookin' up. alicia
