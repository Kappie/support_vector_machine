First of all, I cannot believe I am going to be 27 in a couple of hours.  I am only 3 years from 30.  Where the hell did the time go?  On the upside, Ed and I will be celebrating 9 years of being together...and well, that is a long time, especially since a lot of people who went out as long as we did, didn't make it...a couple did though...  This time last year my husband was taken away from me to go fight in a war.  I was scared and proud all at the same time...the first part of being 26 was filled with a lot of anxiety.  What I learned when I was 26 was the importance of God in our lives and more importantly the the importance of family.  My family really pulled together for me when Ed left.  They helped me through the last few days of my pregnancy, my labor and delivery (all of which I am sure they will not want to expereince again...maybe my mom still wants to be in the delivery room for the next one...my sisters however will rather enjoy the comforts of the waiting room), and the ups and downs of Ed being in the war.  I learned just how irreplaceable Ed is in my life.  I relaized how incomplete my life would be without him...when I heard a missile barely missed them I realized that life is way too precious to let it slip by.  I thank God every day for keeping him safe and bringing him back home to see our beautiful Emily Love.  Oh and how can I not talk about my Emily Love...she was the easiest baby to bring into this world.  She is special just like her brother and sister...she scared me when she was just born, but she got well and has not had any complications since.  She reminded me of just how blessed and fortunate I am in my life.   I am surrounded by very precious people who are worth more to me than anything else in my life, my husband, my children, my parents and my sisters....I alos learned that the few friends I do have truly have become my family and God could not have blessed me more...His blessings in my life are abundant and I learned that more being "26."  I also had my share of losses, I lost some friends, some hope, and well my little child.  The latter I am still coping with, but am sure that the angels are with him or her...and they are watching over all of us, especially the children...but with those losses came enlightenment.  So all in all despite my many hardships this year came a lot of growth, understanding and realization that are important to my development as a person, wife, mother, daughter and sister.  I learned a lot about myself, who I want to be and who I don't want to be.  I learned that having dreams doesn't mean they will be dreams forever and that getting to dreams isn't always a walk in the park, but it doesn't mean you should give up.  I learned that letting go is the key to going on.  Never hold on to something that isn't there.    But the greatest lesson of love has impacted my life the most.  My love for Ed, my children, my parents, my sisters, and some of my friends have deepened with all the events that have happened in this year.  I know they are irreplaceable in my life...and with this I end my last log being 26.  I look forward to a year of new awareness, new findings, new experiences, new memories, even new heartaches, and more importantly a year of more personal achievements.  I must acknowledge Jessica and Leila for the early burthday presents...thank you I enjoyed them.  jessica for taking me and my family out to dinner...it meant a lot to me, I was feeling down and the night out really brought my spirits up...Leila, your words mean so much more to me than anything you could ever buy.  I hope next year you paint me something.  I don't care...I have always been your number 2 (I know mom is number 1) admirer of your work...I know that now that you have finally followed your calling, you will go far...I look forward to seeing and owning some of your beautiful creations...your love and support has truly gotten me througha lot, but especially through this year...Kathleen (who I know will probably never read this because I have not given her the link)...I love you more than you know and it is my greatest hope you one day realize that.  Thank you to all of you who have impacted my life so greatly, especially Ed...you have given me a life I could only dream of, a love so real it scares me sometimes but thrills me most of the time, arms that hold me tight when I am sad and scared, a heart to remind me of what is important in life, children who fill my life with endless happiness, and the promise of more things beautiful to come...thank you for enriching my life with love and happiness.  I love you all!
