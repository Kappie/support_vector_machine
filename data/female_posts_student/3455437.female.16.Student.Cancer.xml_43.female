Certainly this comes as a certain worry to certain group members involved. (No more certains... I promise).  Agreeingly, Maya, Simona, Jeremy and I *have* been going out on a more frequent basis, of late, however, I completely disregard the belief, for me and Maya anyway, that we are intentionally "barring" Shiva, Joelle and Danyel "off". I think it is that Maya, Simona and I are better (or actual) friends with Jeremy which means a car, which means more places available to go and more implusive "outings". For example, the other night at the doof, we left because, yes Jeremy *was* tired, and drivers' decisions are to be held in up most regard, however upon the change in scenery, Jeremy was able to regain a healthy mental capacity....ie not tired....(with the aid of a crappy driver reviver coffee) and we impulsively just went out again.....spur of the moment decision.  But I can understand how that could give the impression of us barring you off (and similar occurances).  I don't think anyone can actually remember the "going up town" episode.....so its not some form of petty "revenge" for that.  But as Maya said (Joelles blog), we didn't realise you felt like this......and will try to keep it in mind so we can all be a group and everything will be all rosey and corny ;)....... seriously though, sorry guys.  ~benj
