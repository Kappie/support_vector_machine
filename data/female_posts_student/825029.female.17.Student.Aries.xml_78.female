(right brandon??)  oh well.. i have a feeling church is gonna be a lot different this year, but i guess as long as my friends keep coming, it'll be alright.  i dunno if i can handle all the "cool kids", as eric says.  us band nerds gotta stick together at st anns.  well, kiddos.. tomorrow's the first day of school!  at first, i did not want to go back at all and i was dreading it very much, but whats the point of getting all worked up about something you cant change, right?  so i'll just go with the flow and maybe it wont be as bad as im making it out to be.  heres my schedule: 1  band (yeahhhh- great way to start the day!) 2  BCIS (please be a blow off class.. please please please) 3  alg 2 preap (mrs. bourg!! yay!!!) 4  wd hist preap (should be fun, or so ive heard) 5  challenge (w/ the one and only mrs smith... *ahem* "student tends to socialize".. what a bunch of crap)  i guess i'll head off to bed now.. gotta get a good night's sleep before the big day!  good luck to everybody  on a side note, dont see "serving sara"... XXX is a classic compared to it  on another side note, charles is the greatest ;)
