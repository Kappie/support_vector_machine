The " Xu(1) Ci(2) " was difficult, I only knew how to do 1 out of the 5 questions. As for " Han(4) Zi(4) ", I knew how to write all 5, hopefully none are wrong.  In my opinion, the " Zao(4) Ju(4) " was the toughest among them all. For paper 1, I wrote questions 2 and 5. I actually wanted to attempt question 3, because we have already done it during Chinese lessons. However, after contemplating for a while, I decided not to, because my Chinese vocabulary isn't that fantastic. Haha. I wonder how the rest thought about this exam besides those whom I have spoken to?     Anyhow! Jiax, Martini, Simon, Jeremy, Zuhyar, Izzat and I headed for the mall to catch  Van Helsing ! It was marvellous! It reminded me of  Lord of The Rings  though, the setting, the music. Haha. Don't worry though, the content is entire different. It's sucha cool movie! DRACULAS! Yeehaw! The main characters are all so good looking! * Aww.. *     There's something wrong with my computer. Yesterday, my lil' sister pushed in the keyboard and the entire screen just rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise. We called the Compaq company but there was no answer. I'm glad that it is a flat-screened comp. I turned the entire screen so now the computer is actually on its side. Heehee.    Things will never be the same again.
