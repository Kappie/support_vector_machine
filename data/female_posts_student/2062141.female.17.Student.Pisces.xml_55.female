Mostly it's been the drama thing. Alice in Wonderland, very cool. 'Specially since Charlotte is like the supporting lead. YAY! But yah it really sucks to be good at drawing cause then you have to help with stuff.... lol. I didn't do as much painting this time around. I just did odd jobs (makeup, various costume stuff)..   Tonight was the first performance, me and Josh sold tickets and it was crazy (wow, what are they teaching us in math. We need to go back to 3rd grade... or just get a calculator... :D :D :D ) But mostly I sold tickets >:| ... cause Josh wanted to watch the play but I saw the preview yesterday... so i got stuck in the ticket booth for like 2 hours in the FREEZING COLD commons (my car windows froze shut, just to give you the idea).   Sitting there in that ticket booth  made me nostalgic for that one weekend for South Pacific last year, with me, Amanda, Mike and Anthony... that was SOOOOOOO fun. May I reminisce with those who participated in that glorious weekend.... Club Spatula, *Butt sex*, neon flamingo, laser pants-pointer, and heating dials. You guys ever wonder why it was so friggin hot in the auditorium that day..? BWAHAHA! oh god that was fun... I miss you Mike! But then back in reality there I was all by myself.   Then Charlotte's old friends from Oregon finally came... they came up to the ticket booth and Char's mom was like "so girls, this is Natalie" and they were like "YOU'RE NATALIE!!!" hahah Charlotte you tell them waaaayy too much about me... they probably think I'm crazy (don't let them know, that's a secret!) But they're all coming over tomorrow (and so is Josh, and Nick, and Erinn! SOO fun!) to my house cause apparently it's awesome and YAY! I finally get to meet Charlotte's old friends! Gonna be soo fun! And I haven't done anything with Erinn in forever! We'll eat taquitos and burritos (char: the TOES!!!) and watch movies and... oh who are we kidding we're just gonna hang in my little room. But my room is quite awesome I must say. YAY fun weekend times...
