Cleaning up today, my guest bedroom, for my christine which should be here in a couple of days. Also, I found a job. I start tomorrow, at 9am It is perfect. Going to the gym in a little bit. I have a deadline of loosing 5lbs in two weeks. I should be able to do it if I work out everyday, and not going grocery shopping.
