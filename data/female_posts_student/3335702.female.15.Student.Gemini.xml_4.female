The wedding was..well..if I lied, magical. If I was honest, as gay as elton john. Somewhere inbetween the speeches praising John Kerry and my cousin trying to sleep with me, I decided to screw the whole thing, and the rest is a blur. I was supposed to go downtown tonight to meet my beautiful love, but instead it looks asthough I'm doomed to yet another night of sitting at home. Tara lacks enough motovation to go downtown, so I'm imprisioned here. This afternoon however, I slipped into somewhat of loneliness. As retarded as that sounds, I was thinking about this, and I'm tired of this solo act I've had, but untill "he" realizes he needs me, just as much as I need him, this is a permanet feeling. The Fall Out Boy CDis somewhat relieving though, considering these boys are MY boys, and have helped me through the thickest and thinnest of times =).
