Well, for rock stuff, Weezer because they're just awesome... for other listening DMB because they're very eclectic... for technical guitar stuff John Mayer... and for funny stuff either BNL or TMBG.  2.  What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why?  Christina Aguilera... she's VERY trashy... it's pretty disgusting.  3.  If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person?  Most likely... they're all pretty laid back and easy going... or just plain crazy and have weird, gross teeth.  4.  Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show?  Weezer shows are always cool... DMB shows are just one big party... BNL... those guys are crazy!  The Green Day guys are fun, too... they let bunches of people come down into the pit for their set.  :-)  5.  What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music?   Okay, here's my take on the whole illegal downloading thing.  There's no way that it can hurt established artists, because most of them have made a lot of money as it is, and the chump change they make off of album sales... well, it doesn't hurt them.  For artists that are just trying to get their stuff out there, it helps them.  For instance, I was listening to some of John Mayer's live stuff before his album was even released to the public, and I planned on buying it after it came out (and I did).  My last little take on this is that it's not as if music downloading will take over and cause CDs to become obsolete.  Think of books and newspapers.  They have stuff online, where you can read it on the computer... and most people still prefer having a physical paper or book in their hands.  I think it's the same thing with CDs.  Because I know there are lots of things that I have on CD BECAUSE I downloaded them and found that I liked it enough to buy the CD.
