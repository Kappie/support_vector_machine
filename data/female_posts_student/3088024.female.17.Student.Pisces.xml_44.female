Shout out to Mr.Gomez Thanks for teaching me how to use Excel!!!  It only took me like 30 mins to do my pre-cal homework thanx to the good old folks at Microsoft!!! What a blessing!!!...unfortunately i did not get all my other 3000 projects done...I think i have given up studying for the SAT and ACT  I just need to relax...if college is anything like this I think I am going to die...I need a girlfriend!  WHERE ARE YOU???
