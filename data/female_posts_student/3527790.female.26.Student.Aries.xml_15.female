Effort is piled up so high Investment is monumental  In reality, Risk is inconsequential, In my heart, Risk is behomothic.  Fear wells up inside A flood threatening To ruin all  At the edge of a dream Gate is open What happens if I can’t walk through Or I get to the doorway an my name isn’t on the list  Desire indescribable, Failure a potential  Quaking  I face the challenge Failure won’t win today.
