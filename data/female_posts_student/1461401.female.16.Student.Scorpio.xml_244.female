Alex and I talked saturday night, and the funny thing was, we hardly even talked about what had happened. We talked about completely random things, like nothing had happened at all. And that was that. I hung out with him sunday, monday, and today. Yesterday (being monday) I was at his house till pretty late and ended up falling asleep in his arms... mmm, who needs an electric blanket when you have a boyfriend? (too bad I can't have one to take home with me!) Then today his mom took us shopping at Frankin Park mall and we had a good time there. He found a b e a u t i f u l trench coat. Think Neo. Think the first Matrix. Then you'll have his coat. He even found really cool shades to go with it. It was a wonderful thing. And now here I am. It's a little past four... by four I mean nine of course. I think I'm ready for bed. Good night all you pretty people :-)  ~Kristin
