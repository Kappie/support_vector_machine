I hope it is...I'm not doing any more on it.  I just spent 2 hours doing that much.  I read the book in an hour, so I figured it would take less time to write the essay.  That was a freakishly easy book.  I want to see the Two Towers.  I love Gollum.  Good luck on everybod'ys piano.  Mine sucked when I played at church yesterday.  Probably cause I was sick though.  I got strep, not the kind where it makes your throat hurt though, it's kinda weird.  But anyway, it's caused my mono to flair up, so even though the strep is gone, the mono isn't.  So I'm gonna go take a nap.  G'night all.
