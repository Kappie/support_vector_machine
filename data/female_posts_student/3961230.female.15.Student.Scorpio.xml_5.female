Anyway, I'm Phoebe Pauline Valentine Sugiharto, Zhu Bao Ling aka Shinomori Iori aka Viscera "Vissy" Valentine. In collaboration with a good buddy of mine, Chii, I am here to provide enough Chiisy supply to last you just enough 'til the Kingdom comes (get the pun? Chii-Vissy  cheesy ). If any of our posts offend you in any way, please do us the favour of posting a comment about it and we will *sniffs* embrace our flaws with *sniffs* open arms *blows nose and screams in agony, lamenting about her own mortality and imperfections*.    Lastly, I wish you enough sanity to last throughout the whole archive and once again, enjoy your stay :)!
