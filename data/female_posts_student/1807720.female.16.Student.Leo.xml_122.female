I would walk through like  narrow halls and all around were people that I knew just staring at me, saying nothing.  Then I went home, got on my scale, and yelled "omg I gained 10 pounds, what am I going to do?!"  LOL.  I guess the message here is to stop eating so much junk!  I am sooooo afraid of weight gain it's not even funny.  I suppose lunch yesterday didn't help.  Ash, Chels, and I went to East Side Mario's for lunch.  We actually had such a good time we were there for two hours.  We even had dessert afterwards - this big chocolate thing which me and Ash just went at.  Chels described it as: "It was like two monkeys fighting over one banana."  Ok I have to admit I am a pig when it comes to chocolate.  I mean c'mon who is like so junk deprived - ME!  Bio actually wasn't that bad yesterday.  I was a little worried about how I did on the unit test.  Turns out I got a 72% - not bad, but I am capable of an 80% or higher and that I know is possible.  Then unit we are getting into now does seem like it would be hard, but it's sooooo much more interesting than anything we studied on the biosphere.  What we are doing kind of reminds me of Chem in a way.  I feel like I am in my comfort zone.  I am also really motivated now because since she said it was a hard unit and I even more determined to prove myself capable of mastering hard tasks.  I have put that quiz that I did bad on in the last unit behind me.  It was one quiz, and a quiz is a quiz - nothing more.  Not ever worth much.  And I know that I am capable of great things.  Drama was also really great yesterday.  I am so proud of the work me and Megz did.  We put a scene together in about 5 minutes.  It couldn't have any words, just actions.  A beginning, middle, and end of course!  We actually weren't trying to make it funny, but everyone ended up laughing at it - so were like "yes we actually made people laugh!"  We even got Mr.B to laugh - mission accomplished!  LOL...  It was about the girl who goes shopping(me) and she sees these amazing shoes at a store, but the clerk(Megz) also wants the shoes, but she hasn't saved enough money for them.  While the shopper is convinced that she couldn't live without the shoes, the sales woman tries to sell her an ugly bag.  However the customer doesn't want it, so both the customer and the saleswoman run the the shoes and they each grab one.  They then circle each other trying to get the other shoe to make a pair.  However, the customer pulls out a $20 for the shoes and the saleswoman can't refuse.  The customer puts on the shoes, and sighs of relief then walks away!  That was our lovely speechless scene.  I am so proud of out work actually.  I felt it was some of my best work in Drama!
