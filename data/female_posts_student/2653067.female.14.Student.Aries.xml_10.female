Kevan was going to come over on friday to help out with the party but my mom said that only Jasmines guests can come.  I was dissapointed after my mom told me that but it's not the end of the world, I might see them on saturday.  Kevan just sent me an e-mail saying that she'd be late for jasmines party because she and Robin are going to get Cody (Shorties puppy).  I kind of feel left out of that but meh.    I don't quite know how to describe how I'm feeling.  Perhaps not seeing my friends is the cause for my odd feeling. I think it's all the homework I've been doing. Could the saying  "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" be right?
