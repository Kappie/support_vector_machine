AMEN! goodness, my best friend, sarah philinda smolen, is way too pretty for her own good.  its really cool when your both walking together somewhere. i swear, i need to get some ugly friends.(jk i love my friends) anyway, lets say a guy sees the both of us. i wonder who he's going to go for: the 5'10", size zero, blonde, blue-eyed girl, or the 5'6", dumpy girl with plain hair, eyes, etc. o sweet.   i really hate when guys say they want to go out with strong girls with a real personality, and then they end up with some bimbo who can barely spell her own name. am i really this unattractive? my mom always says that guys only cares about whats on the inside. what planet is she on? i have never known a guy to care about what what's in the inside without first checking out the outside for defects. is this only my problem?   i have never had a real boyfriend. never, not once. i once told a friend of mine(a girl) and she said that i seem like the kind of person that would always have a boyfriend. she was really suprised when i told her that i had never had one. i have been asked out, so im not completely without hope(although this one guy asked me out even though we only had met once)(and he asked me out online, a big no-no)(but why do i think its a no-no? am i too picky?) i used to think that i had the world on a string. now its barely hanging on by a thread.     My life is your entertainment.(i hope its good)
