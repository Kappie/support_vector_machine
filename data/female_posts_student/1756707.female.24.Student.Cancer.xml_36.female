V. interesting.    Not sure what to make of the blog, but this quote is fascinating to me (other people are considering these ideas!) --   "I'm working on a post about blog-authorship that should go up in the next day or so, but here's a question: Who is the author of this blog? Joe Duemer would be the most obvious answer, but I increasingly have to recognize that the authorship of this blog is collective. Most obviously, Burningbird  Stgavrosthewonderchicken, who have designed the space to my specs, are authors here. But why not include Been  Mean Trott? They wrote the code that makes this space possible. And certainly all the people I link to share in the authorship of my writing to some degree--and whether they approve or not."   We haven't thought yet about linking to people as part of authorship.  We've thought about it (at least in talking about it, I don't know if we've posted anything about this yet) in terms of public/private issues, but not in terms of authorship.  I am writing a post now (here's the meta!) using someone else's words (not that I even know whose they are) to further my own ideas.  Who's the author of this post?
