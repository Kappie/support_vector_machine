I appreciate the right of all Americans to free speech, but there comes a point when free speech turns from stating one's opinion to being blatantly disrespectful and unsupportive of the government and military who are acting to defend and protect, among other things, that constiutional right to speak one's mind. The individuals who are making these arguments, either written or verbal, obviously don't appreaciate the fact that if they lived in Iraq and they were making these statements they would be killed or their female loved ones would be raped and tortured while they were forced to sit there and watch in a room full of biochemical toxins. They claim that President Bush is committing crimes against humanity but they ignore the fact that Saddam Hussein has killed and tortured THOUSANDS of his own people for saying as much in private conversation.   Freedom of Speech aside, the protests that are going on at this point are not only futile but they are disrupting the every day lives of individuals who are trying to keep this country going. We had to cancel court last night because the fucking protestors decided to hang out in front of the courthouse and we were afraid for the safety of the children who participate in our program. Wear a pin, put a sign in your window, but don't prevent justice from occurring or people from getting the help that they need. That is disgusting and a crime against freedom and the founding principles of this country. In  case the protestors forget, the right to due process is another fundamental right of the American citizens that they were preventing children from exercising for absolutely no reason other than giving themselves something to do on a Thursday night.  I love my country and the president that we elected by majority in a legitmiate election (not with the threat of murder and torture like Saddam Hussein) and it disgusts me to hear people claim that he is committing crimes against humanity or that President Bush is a warmonger. And those that are still claiming that this is all about oil at this point or that there isn't evidence that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction might want to pay attention to more than the sissy liberal rhetoric of the American media and might want to pick up a history book or a copy of UN resolution 1441 before they open their mouths and disgrace themselves or our nation even more. I stand by my statement in my last entry that if you're still protesting at this point, just go over there and take the place of an Iraqi citizen and see how your attempts to exercise your rights are greeted in a Nazi-like dictatorship in the middle east. Maybe you should pick up an old copy from the New York Times on September 12, 2001 if you need a reminder as to why it's important to act before we're acted upon.
