We stayed for the reception, then Tyler's family and I went out to Moxie's for dinner. After that, Tyler, Brooke and I went to go see The Butterfly Effect, which was really good. I really enjoyed it.  Been planning stuff for my birthday, cascadia, and Fiona's leave...It's tough. Been babysitting a lot too, so. I'll have to update later.  Blogging has become a hazard here at school...the substitue keeps walking around and looknig at what everyone's doing, and I'm finding it hard to check and write emails, and blog when she is constantly watching. She also doesn't know a thing about computers. She wants me to stop listening to my music because it's using up bandwidth.....when I'm just listening to a cd...Growl.  Anyways, life's threatening. Keep in mind I love the guy, and I love my life, and I know, somewhere, the interesting twist will be there.  Not to mention the youth group actually has close to $700, not $200...but let's not tell Mike that.
