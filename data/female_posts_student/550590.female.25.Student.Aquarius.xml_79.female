On an upnote, my computer is back up and running semi-properly.  Word is still acting freakish and virusy, but it should make it through the weekend, which is all I'm looking for at this point.  However between then and now I have a shitload of things to get done, so there won't be much blogigng for the next few days...wish me luck!
