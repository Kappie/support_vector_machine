Most of them are musical thoughts, for some reason...  I'm made of dirt.  Diiiiiiiiirty. I don't like AC/DC.  Or Moby.  Or Britney Spears.  I don't understand why people do.   I wish there were more artists like Chris Thile and Bela Fleck and Thelonious Monk and Ben Harper.  Black Sabbath was the first "secular" band I ever liked.  Whoa.  Quite a stretch from the Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith I was raised on. I think I only listened to Silverchair in high school because they were from Australia.  I listened to Metallica because my cool older next-door-neighbor Tommy listened to them.   This is the first summer I won't make it to Colorado for like 5 years.  Bummer.  My heart is longing for mountains.  Anyone want to make a fall trip? Why is Christian music so cliche?  Why does every third worship song quote the same verse?  Why doesn't anyone ever write songs about Daniel?  Or Zechariah? Who named the dobro the dobro?  Why? Why do my finger callouses always peel?  Maybe I'm just not meant for the guitar and mandolin...   Hmmm, so evidently I'm not as much of a computer geek as I thought I was, because my pictures only stayed up here for a day, and then they stopped loading.  Sorry about that.  Apparently blogger.com only wants you to use their photo bot thingy...which I don't feel like downloading.  So...no pictures.  Sigh.    Today I decided for like the hundredth time that I love my new job.  It rules.  There's just no other way to say it.  I love it.  Today a boy that ran (They call it eloping...but don't you have to be  with  someone to elope?  Apparently not, according to Dictionary.com) came back to the treatment center.  He's a very high risk individual - he's very young, and he already has multiple scars from self-harm.  He also has a strong interest in the occult.  The thing that the LORD layed on my heart to pray for him is  redemption .  I can't write his name here for confidentiality laws, but if you read this blog, please pray for J.  He needs to know that life isn't just about pain.  Today at work I also met a new fellow employee name Seamus.  (pronounced Shay-muss)  You always read about those Irish folk named Seamus, but I've never met one in person.  He's funny.  And he's bigger than my brother, which is not something I would expect from someone named Seamus.  (If you've never met my brother, think football linebacker.)    At work I have to watch a whole bunch of training videos on suicide assessment, the affects of different drugs, treatment possibilities, etc.  I learned that of all the drugs available out there, alcohol (yes, alcohol is a  drug , folks!) has the worst withdrawal symptoms, with the highest fatality rates.  You just never know what you'll learn next...  I have recently discovered that Yahoo messenger has this great function - you can use it to play all kinds of different music.  It's sort of like radio stations.  I'm stuck on the Reggae one.  Currently I'm listening to Peter Tosh singing "equal rights".  Marley songs are a staple of this "station."  It's stellar.  Did you know that Rastas believe the Messiah was reincarnated in the form of an Ethiopian king?  Craaaaazy, mon, craaaaaazy.    Ok, I think the randomness needs to end here.  Sleep would be good.
