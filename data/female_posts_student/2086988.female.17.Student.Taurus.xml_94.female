Like today, I finally stood up to Welch and I stood up for myself and this other girl. I'm so sick of seeing people getting put down then having to feel like crap. It's ridiculous, people shouldn't be treated this way. And from now on I am going to stand up for myself and others. I don't care what other people think or anything, call me a bitch I don't care, I'm just doing what is right. And it feels good. You know, I might stay in theatre, it depends, if I make north stars or not, if I do, then I might be able to stay in the class but not do so much extra curricular plays, but if I don't then back to theatre. I'm not going to let this run me out of theatre, I can prove to them I'm just as good being in JV as being in Varsity, and you know, some people are moving, so there's a chance I can get moved up. I think, that this will show Welch, I'm not going to stand in the shadows anymore, but I'm going to be heard. I believe everything happens for a reason and maybe this whole thing was to teach me not to hold back, but stand up and be heard. And dammit, I will! :)   Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms When the world outside's too Much to take That all ends when I'm with you
