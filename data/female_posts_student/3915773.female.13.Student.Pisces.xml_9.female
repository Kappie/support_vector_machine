'People love commercials,' said Vince Stanzoine, managing director at the network outside of London. Marketing for the Advert Channel takes the same stance, with slogans like, ' Everything you'd see on a normal TV channel- except the programs.    Programming consisting entirely of commercials seems completely ludicrous and even funny here in the United States. After all, isn’t that what boring hours of infomercials, advertising things like cooking pans, are for? That obviously isn’t the case in Britain, probably due to the major differences between commercials in the US and Europe. Britons seem to enjoy the content between programming, which is usually creative and entertaining (Take for example, the Ikea lamp commercial we watched in class). In contrast to the Britain opinions on advertising, a study by Yankelovich Partners discovered that 65% of consumers feel bombarded by the amount of advertising. In addition, 69% would support the purchase of devices to omit or obstruct ads. However, nine specials on ABC, called “The Best Commercials You’ve Never Seen (And Some You Have)”, were popular with their incorporation of foreign commercials and comedy. Should a channel be devoted to commercials here in the United States? Would Americans embrace lineup upon lineup of nonstop commercials? Or should there just be a television show with an arrangement of some of the most entertaining commercials?
