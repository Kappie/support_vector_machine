He lies all the time and it really does take a toll on me.  It was driving me away.  So before we actually started anything I asked Ferrell if I could talk to him in the hall.  I explained to him how everyone felt about his lies and all that.  Of course he tried to defend himself.  But what was really awkward was when he couldn't make eye contact with me anymore and never has not been able to keep eye contact with me.  I knew I had embarrassed him.  I thought to myself I really screwed that up.  I went to go back into the room and he grabbed be my waist and asked me how the party went without him.  I told him how Matt imitated Britney Spears the pole dancer and how Honig became aroused.  But he was very touchy feely with me the rest of the day.  I don't know if he respects me more for speaking with him or if he was aroused by my being direct.  I'll go with the idea of respect.  Well I'll wait and see what happens later.
