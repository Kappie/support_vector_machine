I was giving up my NSYNC, Hanson, even my Robyn CD. I went to CD Warehouse to try and sell them. Long story short, they only took 3 and I only got $5.50! AHH ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING! Then I called Flannagan's that night to ask about MBR tickets. The guy picked up the phone and I started to say hello and ask my question at the same time so I said, "WHAHAKJBAJEK" literally that's what came out of my mouth. I started laughing, but he made no reaction. Last night the weather was crazy! Liz and the leaders and I were going to go see Shrek 2. But Liz couldn't come, and that sucked, but I still went cause I was all dressed. We were supposed to meet in the lobby of Lennox at 7:20. Around 7:35 I called Margaret to see where she was. Well, because of the Shania concert, she was stuck on 315 but was sure she'd be there in like 10 minutes. Well they showed up around 8:25. It was so funny, I waited in the lobby for an hour by myself! People thought I was stood up, it was great. The "pretty" freshman all saw. AHH there were tons of CSG people there. I was talking to Ann on the phone and she told me it was the Shania concert holding everything up, and I screamed "Shania is playing tonight?!" and everybody turned and stared in judgment. When they finally arrived, I saw Ann throw herself out the window waving as Margaret drove by the theater. Crazy. The movie was really funny. We saw a Harry Potter preview and screamed. I'm so excited for June 3!
