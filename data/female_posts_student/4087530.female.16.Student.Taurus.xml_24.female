Yay, I found somebody (that is two people, what a success) who accompany me to the cinema to watch "Coffee and cigarettes". Apart from that I´m tired.  I actually pretty like French, but in the lessons of yesterday I almost felt asleep. Sigh. And I received my books for school. Half of them is as thick as about one or two thumbs.  One mate rhetorically wondered what they thought when printing the history book. Our librarian´s answer: "Well, they are full of mistakes anyway." Now I´m becalmed. Now, we can search for all the mistakes. This is gonna be a great pleasure, I suppose. The books of men´s history have to be rewritten!
