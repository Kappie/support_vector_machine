His hands were always so warm and the warmth from them always made my stomach feel better. I would have him place his hand on my stomach, where it hurt and he would always make the pain go away. He always thought that that was so funny. Other than that, things are going ok, less than smooth but ok. I have tons of schoolwork to finish up before the end of the semester but I am fairly confident I will get most of it finished in time, I always do.   Now that I think about it... I don't really want to go to work in the morning...... why can't it be friday again.
