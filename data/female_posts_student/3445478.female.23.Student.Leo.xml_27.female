We went down to the cities area for Brooke's baby shower-she's due on July 9th and we stayed at Megan  Dave's beautiful new home. I absolutely love their home!!! If I could design and build a house, I would like it to resemble their home. That night we went out to eat and Nick was  a bit  crabby due to being in his car seat almost the entire day. The next day was the shower. The guys all went out to a movie and we girls stayed at Megan  Dave's for the shower. Megan did an incredible job! We played a fun game-we were given a piece of gum and had a few minutes to mold the gum into a baby! At the start of the shower, we all introduced ourselves and gave Brooke a piece of advice. I thought this was a great idea. There was another baby there who was 3 1/2 months old. Her mom said she slept through the night from the 1st night home from the hospital...BS!!! 1st of all, her baby breastfeeds and that requires the baby to be up every few hrs at night to eat as breastmilk goes though a baby faster and easier than formula does. I don't like mom's who lie. It's ok to say that your baby is not perfect and gets up once or twice during the night. Even if you attach your baby to your breast at night and go to sleep and your baby feds itself, it is still waking up and eating  not  sleeping though the entire night! OK, I'm done venting... Sunday, today, is father's day.  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY SHAWN !!! This morning we went to a Father's Day brunch. It was so good! Megan and I had an orange juice and champagne drink. I think it's called, omarosa or something like that.-It was great for sipping. This afternoon Nick, Shawn and I got to nap together and shortly later Pam, Nick and I headed back home. This weekend, Nick discovered fruit...strawberry's and catalope. He also sucked on a cookie. I think he's both teething and going through his 3 month growth spurt. Overall, he did great this weekend. Thank you Dave and Megan for letting Nick  I enjoy your beautiful home!
