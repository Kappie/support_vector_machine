My brother's fiance had a dentist appointment so they had to leave early. We're not going tomorrow either because it's their break day. I made chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies! They turned out great, I'm so proud of myself hehe :) I really love baking. I want to learn how to cook, so I'll be working on that. I wish that I hung around the kitchen more when my mom would cook in the past.  The topic I was thinking about today was "Romance" I wonder if anyone out there is naturally "romantic". I'm still waiting for the day I meet someone who is. Well... that's all from me for now.
