Sara got her license though, I'm very happy for her =)  For her birthday, we went to Red Heads, then we went to play pool.  Lauren and I lost the first game, but we won the second game and I got the shot =)  Whooo I felt special.  Wish I had a pool table to play on -_-              Other than that, I feel kinda...like I'm fading.  Just fading from people.  I was thinking this earlier but then I realized that I didn't update from yesterday -doh- so I decided to put these both in one entry.  I feel like I'm still close to  my friends, but on the other hand, not as important to them anymore.  Maybe I'm not -_-  I'm disappointed in myself for letting it get like that though -_-         And I also think I gained weight again this week.  Some of my cloths didn't really fit yesterday.  I'm disappointed in myself for that two.  If only my fat would fade away like how I feel I'm fading away from some of my friends, that would be great =D  Should just switch the situations.  -sigh-         On a happy note, I think Laura from the IMBB is gonna come and visit me today =D  We've been planning this all summer and I think it's finally gonna happen today.  I can't wait to finally meet her.  Then I get to see her in Sept at the McBrain Damage show.  Yay.              I guess that's all.  Oh, wait....lemme say one thing:      About the friend thing, I'm not  trying  to drift from any of you.  I just feel as if I'm not really there with you anymore :/  I feel left out, or just not wanted if I'm talking to you.  I'm not saying I don't want to be friends with you, because I do.
