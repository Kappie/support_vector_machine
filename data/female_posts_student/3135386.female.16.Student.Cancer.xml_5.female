Wow...time sure flies by fast, even when I am looking forward to something.  It's been such a busy week, and it's just not slowing down. Friday: Worked Saturday: Worked Sunday: Worked Monday: Worked Tuesday:Robin came over Wednesday: Robin and I went to her place, and two others came over a well. Long story...lets just say it was a very interesting Lord of the Rings marathon (that was my boob!!!)(screamed by every girl there at least once...0 Thursday: came home, went straight to an eye appointment, went to Rotary meeting, drove half an hour, went shopping, came home, went to karate and then dashed to prom. (three friends graduating...this sucks. -_-)  Today-->Friday: Party in the next down (a 'my birthday/school's out/very early guy fawkes day) Saturday: Work Sunday: Work Monday: Work Tuesday-Thursday: Get ready to go to brazil...  Wow...finally thanks to one of the rotarians in my club, who was a bit annoyed that I hadn't heard anything about this exchange phoned up my YEO and asked about what was going on. I finally, have answers. *grins* Hopefully, the visas should arrive today, and then he'll buy tickets, and we'll leave on July 1st. If they don't arrive until next week, we'll be going the week after. I feel enormously relieved, I had nearly managed to convince myself that I wasn't going to get to go, because we hadn't heard anything (even with phoning) for two months...  Huge kudos goes out to Roberta who although she didn't have to, was on the phone finding out all this info for me, instead of just sympathizing like everyone else because we were really at a loss of what to do.  Tchau!
