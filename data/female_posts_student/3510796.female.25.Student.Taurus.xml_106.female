Yes, I went to see Spiderman II last night.  By the way, the psychology final was awesome.  He took the questions right outta the study guide, word for word, answers in the same order.  It was great.  Finished by 6:20.  Back to Spiderman.  I thought the action scenes were really good, but a lot of talking.  A lot of talking about emotions and hero-ish type explanations.  I also thought they made a good connection between the comic books and the movie by showing how Peter Parker couldn't keep a job because he was out fighting evil.  This second movie was also a bit more 'scary'. Thanks to Evan, I hear Spiderman III is in the works.  Harry coming back as the Green Goblin?  God, I hope so. Next up-Anchorman.  Gotta see that.  It's time for a comedy.     Sports Report  Seems as though the American League won 9-4.  I guess those Yankee fans really do have something to smile about today.  =)     News worthy  When is it ok to say 'Fuck you, Dad'?  Im not talking about  The Breakfast Club  either.    urlLink SANDOWN, N.H.
