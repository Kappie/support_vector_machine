One person said that people who have "conversations" yes full out talks not splices of chopped up words that most of us are used to, but actual conversations are no longer considered "eccentric" but rather quite intelligent.  It was also brought to my attention that dog's have the ability to learn up to 300 words, that being an "exstensive" doggy vocabulary, (I however think they were only talking about the far superior cognitive canine's like Sheppards, Golden's, Lab's etc. who are used as assisted living dog's, but nothing was specified as far as I know so we'll leave it open to interpretation) this being said supposedly it means those people who carry on complete conversations with their pet's are therefore more cognitively superior humans?  Does that make sense?  Or perhaps does one who is a capable human being of the higer end on the intelligence scale search out random facts like these to justify what would otherwise be known as odd (eccentric) behaviour.  On that note, I also would like to mention I feel that people who are eccentric do more then just talk to their pet's its more of a lifestyle you embrace not one action you adopt.  I then also feel it is inappropriate to use eccentricity to define one who carries on conversations with their pets. That being said Princeton on the web defines eccentric as a person of a specified kind (usually with many eccentricities); "a real character"; "a strange character"; "a friendly eccentric"; "the capable type"; "a mental case"...  so I guess I'm wrong and perhaps eccentric is an appropriate word after all?  You tell me...
