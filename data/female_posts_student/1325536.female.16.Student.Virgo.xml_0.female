The bathroom was the second to last room at the end of the hall, right next to Damien's bedroom. He closed the door behind him, not bothering to lock since there was only Joel around. As he kicked off his flip flops, Damien also threw his beach towel into the clothes hamper beside the sink. The he finally pulled down his swimming trunks which were still wet and made a squeaky sound when brushed against the skin of his legs.  Those were also tossed in the clothes hamper. Damien stepped into the shower stall and turned the water on. A quick spray of cold water hit him before it finally turned warm.   Maybe we'll catch a movie on Pay-Per-View , the boy thought as he squeezed out some shampoo from a bottle that was close to being empty.  His face wore a happy expression as he thought of spending time with his big brother without his parents around to remind him that it was time to go to bed.  "I have him all to myself."  While Damien worked up a lather and scrubbed furiously to get the clorine out of his hair, he noticed how good it felt to have the warm water running down his prepubescent body after such a long day of carefree play. After rinsing his hair, Damien reached for the soap and when his mind wandered to thoughts of Joel he suddenly got a visual in his mind of Joel taking a shower. The boy's face burned with embarressment at the idea of such a thing.  "No... why am I thinking that?"  The bar of soap dropped from Damien's hands. He reached down to pick it up and tried to banish such thoughts of Joel from his mind, having no idea what caused them in the first place.  "What's wrong with me?" Damien whispered to himself as he rubbed his soapy hands over his body, cleansing physically despite his dirty mental state of mind.
