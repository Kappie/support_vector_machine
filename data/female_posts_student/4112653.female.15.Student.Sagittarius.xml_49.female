There's at least 5 people leaving our group and  moving up to the college group next year. Lynn, Von, Sherman, George, and I  think Aimee?          2. Let me clarify something - I don't mean that  everyone MUST always have something to say, I don't mean that you should say  something if you really don't feel comfortable with it. But we all need to  realise that that's what Bible study is about: studying the Bible together,  discussing the text! Why else would we have a Bible study GROUP if it was for  one person to talk and talk and everyone else to listen? There are times to  listen, times to talk, and we kind of have to do both, peoples : ) Plus, I  assure you, it's much easier to talk out of your own choice rather than the  leader pick on you...
