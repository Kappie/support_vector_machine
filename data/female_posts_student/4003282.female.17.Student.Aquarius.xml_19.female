I let me mom and Amy read about her this morning.       I have a headache. I'm so tired. But I'm happy I got to talk to my Josh for a really long time. I have Tiger Fever stuff to do tomorrow. Then I might have to work on Tuesday and Thursday. The hours switched at work. Six Flags closes at like 7 I think. Yayness.
