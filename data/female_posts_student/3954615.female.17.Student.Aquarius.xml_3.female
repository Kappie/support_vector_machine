ARGHHHHx.. so irritating. now i finally understood what xiaojun meant. if i have a choice, i would rather not want anyone to like me.   he is not ugly or anything. i just don't have any feelings for him. and he mumbles to himself. he is not the type i would go for. he is not dark, he is not tall. he is kinda slack too. i like guys who are serious at his work, or rather, who knows when to get serious. i like guys with intelligence, and who have a sense of humour. he doesn't fit any of the criteria.  he likes me because he thinks i am sweet(i guess..) but i am not!! haiz. only my close friends know me. my 04s209 ex-classmates will know. i seem quiet to the guys because none of the guys talks to me. the guys from my ex-class used to bully me and call me ah-lian.. but i didn't mind that. we had alot of fun at least. this current class.. quite boring i suppose. the guys don't take initiative to talk to the girls. most of them are ungentlemenly as well. expects the girls to carry the benches after p.e lessons!! tsk tsk tsk. well if they were to know me better, i am sure none of them would fall for such a violent girl like me. they don't know me yet. i am not QUIET nor am i SWEET(that's what some people say i am). oh please. wake up. don't bother me anymore.   i always says 'never deny your feelings for someone just because you think ur fear of rejection is too hard to bear'. this doesn't apply to "him".
