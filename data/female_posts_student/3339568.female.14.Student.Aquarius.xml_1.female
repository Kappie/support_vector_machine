Right now I am sitting in the cold, cold room (no heater or fire) with mi sleeping bag wrapped around me and hardly being able to read the keys (so please excuse the typos! :p) at 2:00am in the morning. We haven't slept one little bit, all the sugar and cafefine we have consumed is doing its job! Out of every1 here, Mel, Pip L, Pip M-H, Steph S, Hannah, Gemma, Helen, Rach (Casey and Rach left earlier cuz they couldnt sleep ova) only Steph is asleep, and the rest of us (but mainly Mel) are pretty active!!  So far, we've watched Finding Nemo - yay! Which was REALLY cute, and was the first time I'd actually seen the whole thing with no interuptions, because the other time I was babaysitting Grace and she kept on calling me so I had to leave while the movie was on so I missed heaps of it, but meh, I saw it this time! We consumed copius amounts of sugar during the movie, and Helen was very successful in making a really good fire to keep us warm!! And we had lots of girly chats, with Helen reciting the events of her first kiss in French, and Rach giving a very funny translation. (Helen: ( in French )"It happened one day in spring..." Rach: ( her "translation" in English ) "And he slowly leaned forward, and I could smell the garlic bread he had previously eaten..."  Mel and Hannah and I were praying outside b4, which was really good, we were joking that the spiritual effects of this house were rubbing off on us! We sat outside in the freezing cold because everywhere we went in the house to pray some1 kept on running into us!!  Right now I think that every1 is about to go to sleep and we are in the process of setting the alarm 4 about 7:45am in the morning (ugh-WAY too early 4 me!!) as usual Mel is still on a high, even though we are going to "sleep" now. And i think i can hear her talking about nuts, beautiful, fabulous conversation from u there Mel, thanks 4 that if u read it!! Everyone is suspecting that I'm writing bout them and Gemma is telling me "To keep it quiet because the keys are too loud!", and Helen is all like "What are you writing about us?" haha. I'm writing exactly what ur saying!!! muhahahaha.... im watching!  well newayz, movin on, this nite was pretty fun, and rach want me to get off so she can write her blog, but i just wanna add that i got mi 1st exam back the otha day, art and i got 92% - yay! And Hannah Wiseman got full makrs! Man, she is good. Ok well, gtg.  Blogging off, Beth
