Since it made so much different in the music industry! Go here to read!MPAA Fights Back! [ Mon Jul 29, 04:59:15 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] In My Cd Player...  Before I leave in my CD player right now is Starsailor's Poor Misguided Fool. Can't write much about it since I am out of here right now... but it rocks! I especially like the title track. I suggest you head to their website so you can check out their music and listen in!

My grandfather and Betsy rock! I got to sleep a lot and go out and eat a lot and drink.... NOTHING (because of my liver test today) but still I had the best time! My grandfather has challenged me to a Gin taste test the next time I am down, so I now have to hit the ABC store and teach myself the subtle differences between all Gins! The weather was beautiful and clear! I listened to a book on tape on the way down, The Beach House by James Patterson (go here to see what I thought: The Beach House. I then went to a gallery in Biltmore Square (right outside of Biltmore Estate... which my ancestors owned since I have Vanderbilt in me thanks to Grandma... my only question is where's my money???) called New Morning Gallery. There I discovered the coolest artist team ever under the name Sticks, Inc. and my new goal is to buy ALL of their furniture! Every piece of it. It is what my house will look like! We ate out a lot and then there was Belle Chere! But what you should really ask me about is Christian Kane and Andie MacDowell!

They are testing me for Lupus, Lime disease, other tick related diseases, they are setting up a catscan, they are setting up a sleep study, and of course they are redoing my liver test! PLEASE JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME! I am so tired of being tired all the damn time!
