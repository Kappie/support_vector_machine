I love somersaulting, twisting, turning, just enjoying the mobility and near weightlessness of it all.  I love swimming alone.  When you have the whole dang pool to yourself.  That’s the best.  why don’t I swim very often?  It’s because of that blasted Bever pool.  A few years ago, my sister would take me to the nearly-deserted pool and we’d swim for a while.  I loved that.  And then they remodeled it.  Now it’s a wade-in pool with fountains and waterslides, and all the people in their tiny bikinis go there and tan in the two-inch-deep water at the shallow end.  Caged in.  What happened to the little, dirty, cracked-bottomed, pool I loved so?  Now it’s a popular place.  And I hate it.  Sure, I might go there once, maybe twice a year, but I never really enjoy it.  This is where “improvement” leads us.  It drives away what was there before.
