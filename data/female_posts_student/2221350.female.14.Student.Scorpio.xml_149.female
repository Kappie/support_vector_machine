I basically did a bit of everything that could be considered nothing.   today was different.   woke up earlier than usual and headed to bingo. Fun fun fun. Contrary to the normal sequence of events, I actually won. It was cool except that I had to share my winnings with 7 other people who had won, leaving me with $28. It's 28 dollars I didn't have before I suppose. Headed to the "gettin' place" after that and bought a couple pairs of pants.   came home.  mom made seared tuna steak with roasted asparagus and buttered parsley potatoes. It was day-um good. I wouldn't have mentioned dinner, as it is always some culinary epiphany where my mother is concerned, unless it directly affected my well-being.   what happened is mom made steak for Devon and mammaw because Devon is allergic to tuna and mammaw is allergic to things outside her tiny tupperware box. I tried a bit of mammaw's steak, which had a peppercorn and juniper berry crust, and came to discover something: that I am allergic to juniper berries. I puffed up, itched, my stomach hurt, and I felt shitty all night, and still do to some degree. Mainly I am annoyed and feel a bit high, which is why I've been bouncing around all night and exasperatedly yelping at everyone.    night before last, Jonathan called and we talked for about six hours. It was nice. He called again today, but we only talked for a wee bit and he was supposed to call back.   Lauren is spending the night and someone gave her a painkiller for cramps. I think I'll go watch her giggle at disconnected funnies and glaze over at any notion of clarity.
