So today when I needed to look up an address on Map Quest the idea came into my mind. What if I tryed his address to get directions. And sure enough it gave them to me and I couldn't believe it. I had passed his street a houndred times in the past year or so. I couldn't believe my luck. But then reality set in and I realized that my dad will never take me to go see him. But who knows, maybe I can find someone else to take me. Friends maybe considering non of my family members would take me. So maybe I could bribe some people tonight to go for a little road trip. It could happen (only in my dreams)!
