And luckily he kept his composture yesterday when the German level the points. No doubt, the road ahead is tough, but I'm crossing my fingers that he will go all the way! There is the quarter final match at 7pm tonight against the Thailand champ. Good Luck!   The Olympics has been great, producing exicting showdowns and upsets. The swimming events have been sensational. I knew it that Ian Thorpe will defend his 200m free gold. Boy, what a match! Pity that the Australian didn't succeed in defending their 4x200 freestyle relay.       Not much interesting stuffs happened today. Had to clean the cupboard because I'm the QM. Amazing how strentous and horrible it is to clean just a cupboard, and there were like 3 of us doing it. And we haven't complete it! Haha, we tried some cheerleading stuffs, and I think it was disastrous. Lol. Oh, I hate having to call the ex dance seniors to ask about about dance costumes. I tried calling 6, 3 answered, 2 wrong no., 1 without any reply. Is so irritating! (shudders*) I still have 7 to go!! (sobs*)      Oh and there was the Project Work, which I loathe so much. I absolutely see no point of doing PW and how it will help us. I don't even want to start on that topic. It can make a lovely* entry and I shall save it to another day. I'm too hungry to vent my frustration. Lol. Btw, I think we spent most of the time during PW bitching about other stuffs. This certainly bring back fond memories from St Marg's. Hehe. (winks*)      Might be going to Lin Hui's house to bake cookies, along with Valerie. Should be quite fun and exicting! Ooo, is been a while since I baked anything. Was going to bake cookies with Felicia and Mum Yeng during 1st 3 months. But I was sick on that day and had to miss it. Those cookies were heavenly delicious!!! Yummy! They were so sweet to give me the unburnt ones, coz I was having a sore throat.       Ah, I always so lethargic these days. Need some pumping music to get me going. The thing is there is hardly any nice dancy songs on air. Oh well, going to stop here. I'm too hungry to continue.....
