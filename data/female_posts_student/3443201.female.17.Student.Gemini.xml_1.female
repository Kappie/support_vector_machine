These two God's gifts are bound to suffer from their roots.   I may sound as a desperate poet, vague as I can be.  But it's undeniable that though this,  my heart can shout its rage and my soul can soar in the vast universe .  Life can't be any simplier.  Binary system works only for few.  "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman(Britney's famous line)".  Shouldn't I enjoy every minutes of my teens?  NO! As If I'm shouldering the biggest problem of any teens will encounter and enduring its pain.  This is not about feeling little, nor a-guy, not even about failing marks.  It is more complex.  'Ummm...any person who'll read this blog would be helplessly puzzled.  Bluntly speaking,  my dad cheated on my mom (It has been two years or three).  When we lost my sister way back 1998, my dad change (total change).  For that, our home became empty. From a caring dad to a callous person.  I've witnessed his stuggles to provide us a better life.  But sad to say, I was blind to see and far enough to stop his deeds.  He's capable of hurting my mom physically and emotionally. He also hurt my older sister, Almira.  I would be unfair to defend my mom as well.  Her words were harsh and sharp that it cuts.  She's provoking a fight (to be direct).  Sometimes,  I convinced my self to laugh throughout the whole episode!  Not in my dreams had existed that our lives would be the same in some "telenovelas or teleseryes".  If I'll go on in every detail it'll take so much time and eat my page.  Like those stories created in the minds of the directors or the movie itself.  There were breath-taking scenes, heart-breaking moments, fun rolling lines, and fearful anger.  It's a complete movie "drama, comedy, and action".  To clear-up some hanging thoughts I have mentioned,  those two God's GIFTS refer to my younger bro who's only 11 and my incoming sibling (expecting a DEcember baby). When I've heard the news that my mom is pregnant I don't know what to react and feel exaclty.  She's crying to.  And my stupid mouth reaches my sister's ears that made her fret and she cried too, which worn my heart! I have so many doubts and now, I was thinking to give so much LoVe for the baby because s/he may not feel any from my parents (which alarms me).  I'm not ready though.  THE CROWD was our representation (including my kins, the snake woman(she's a prosti)!, her son - who my dad claims as his but he's not even sure!).   Who's to be blame?  In my mind I blamed everything to this woman's venom!  But No, that shouldn't be the question!  Right one:  Who can save us from the verge of hell?
