He spent yesterday with his girlfriend. Today we all met at Becky's house for a birthday lunch. We made enchiladas and Mexican rice and baked him a chocolate cake. Everyone but Jimmy was there. Dennis and I (mostly Dennis)  got him an accustic guitar, I got him some Zelaznay books, Becky and John got him a new (used) amp for his electric guitar that has special features on it, and Jessi gave him $10. Plus John got his car on the road and Mike got to drive it briefly. Insentive to get his license, I think! Dennis and I had a wonderful weekend, too. Friday night we just watched some movies at home, and cooked on the grill. Nice and relaxing. Saturday, as I said, Mike took off, so Dennis and I had the day. We took Mike out to his girlfriends, then did a little bit of 'road farming' (taking off down country roads which we have never been down and have no idea where they lead). When we got back into c'ville we went to Woody's for lunch and sat for a while just talking. We headed back home to do some housework and yard work. We made it as far as to pick the remaining green beans from the garden and walk over to the next door neighbors to give it to them. Russ offered Dennis a beer and you can about guess the rest! We all sat talking for about and hour or more, until I finally said I had to get my shower to get ready for our dinner that night. I left Dennis there and that's where I found him 45 minutes later when I came back! So I sat down and joined them. By this time Dennis was feeling pretty good. Every time Dennis would say we have to go, Russ would open him another beer... By the time we left Dennis was talking with his eyes closed and was barely able to stumble home. But he was in a very good mood. I got him to get into the shower and I fixed him a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches to eat thinking some food in his belly might slow down the alcohol a bit. He was so funny! I laughed so hard my cheeks hurt. We did finally make it to our dinner at the American Legion, where surprizingly enough he ate dinner first (some very fine catfish, btw) and during the course of the evening only drank two more beers (at least until we got back home!). It was a wonderful day, I haven't laughed as much or as hard in more time that I can remember.
