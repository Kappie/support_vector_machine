Nothing has changed with the pool guy, he hasn't came around or anything, except for him and his father calling me a whore in my garage...ya know. I've actually been having a bit of fun lately. Been able to hang out with some people. The other night I went out to a friends house and I brought my friend Twinkee with me, and he got drunk off some nasty stuff called Southern Comfort. And so he had to be home so I took him home and he wouldn't stay there and he jumped in the back of my truck and I was like, alright...you can come with me. So I went back and asked some of the guys to help me keep him there and so basically, we stopped on the road outside his house and dumped him out of the truck and drove off. It was kinda harsh, but he was okay. Then later we went and checked on him and he had thrown up everywhere, it was so nasty. Then tonight we went to Walmart because a guy had a blowout on his truck and needed a tire, then we went to KFC and saw Robin, a chick that this guy Mike is likeing, and came back to Twinkees and just hung out there until 12:30 and Kerry drove me home. I like going and hanging out, its different. I'm so used to just, sitting at the pool, then coming home and siting here, maybe talking on the phone or watching TV. Something different is nice once and a while.   But anyway...thats about all for now. I'll keep ya posted!
