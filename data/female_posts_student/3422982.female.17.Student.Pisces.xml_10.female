I just wish Molly could have been there to talk to me.  I hope she's having fun being a camp counseler though.  Tonight is our final concert.  I'm glad choir is finally over.  YAY!!  No more dealing with Snavely!!  I'm excited!  And then tomorrow we get our yearbooks and get to mess around.  I forgot to buy tickets to get food and junk... I hope they'll be selling them tomorrow.  Mom and I are going to a baseball game tomorrow night too.  Good times.  I won't be able to take my driving test, there's no way I'll have time.  Some people are being optimistic about it though.  I don't think so however.  Which sucks some major ass.  I'm still in a depressed state and I can tell to because my back hurts.  AND I'm sick... I didn't have a voice this morning.  My throat is killing me at the moment cuz I've been singing all day for this choir festival.  Then I have to sing tonight and I'm done!  I can't wait.  Ok, I dunno what else to say at the moment.  I'll just keep my mask on and hope it doesn't fall off like it did yesterday.  Just gotta hope... later dayz
