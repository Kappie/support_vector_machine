All your dirty looks and biasness Ain't gonna change me Ain't gonna hurt me Ain't gonna bring me down  I'll get even, yes I will I will continue to find a way until I make you cry, I make you lose Ever since the day you blew that fuse  You're a dog, barking whenever you like Well, it's not cool, I hate your side Cause when you are a bitch, that makes me one too If you're gonna be bitchy to me, I'll be bitchy to you  Scowl your pretty face and scratch your zits Flaunt all you like I'm gonna put you to the pits Let's see how you can pull my strings Let's see how you can control me
