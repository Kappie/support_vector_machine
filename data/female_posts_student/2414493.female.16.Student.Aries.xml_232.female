I don't know how many hours I've been up now, since the red eye addles everything and the excitement in itself is just enough to keep one up. No curfew, either, though I'm not taking it to full advantage yet. I think most of us don't know each other quite well, even suitemates. I hope that changes once we actually get into classes.  But there are 1000 HS students here! So it's none of that cozy, YSP feel. I'm taking pictures, yes, but I don't have a cable so I can't really put them up quite yet. There's one ethernet jack for the whole room, so I'm taking Sarah's desk right now until they send that 50-footer from home.  So the roomies: Shoan Yin: I've known her the longest through talking and all and I guess we assigned each other to look out for each other. We're in the same bedroom, and the other two are in the other one. From Canada. Very chatty, observant. More Chinese than American, I think. No holds barred on summer spending, though.  Ishita: I keep on forgetting her name. She's nice, but not particularly conversational. Indian. Intro to Bio. Is spending the night with her parents at a hotel because they're going to be in town a bit longer.  Sarah: Our local Boston girl. Asleep right now, but I don't blame her. Has a voice like Christina Lamb's. Has a friend here too, they kind of stick together. I have the idea that she's the most social of the bunch. She was here first and took a bed, etc. which kind of annoyed me, but we're ok now.  Other people:  Nora: our proctor. From Arizona, timid, red hair. Harvard student There's some pretty nice girls down the hall too.  But it's weird, I like Charlie's dorm best of all. OF course, there's Charlie...I don't think I would be as comfortable as I am now without knowing someone close by. And his roommate Matt is also very approachable. I'm going to church with him tomorrow. Remember how I've always been tempted to go back to church? Well, here's my chance at a fresh start though I neglected to bring the Bible with me...well, if it really matters that much I'll go out and get my own. NIV this time, heh.  I like it here. I've unpacked, walked around both with friends and alone. I guess we're pretty quiet these first few days. Watched Underworld with Pennypacker 16, long long film. I have internet, which makes me happy. Very happy. And I'm just about to go to bed; I need to wake up tomorrow morning and shower off all that summer yucky sweat.  It's really a new world. I'm not homesick or anything, just completely open.  Mark's here, and I saw Vicky Ho today!   Well, wish me luck. It's the beginning of another grand adventure. Miss you all, and love you lots!
