I can't say I didn't find people across the country with whom I can share ideas, values, memories, and friendships. I can't say I didn't learn a lot about myself as a person. I can't say I haven't changed, but I can say that I don't know exactly how I have changed.    I'm different, but I can't yet put my finger on it. I just know I've changed...and in my opinion, it's for the better. JSA was an amazing experience and looking back at being overwhelmed with "less sleep than I thought possible for the human body to function and more homework, readings, papers, tests, and speeches than I thought were within the legal limit," I'd do it all again just to come out of the month the person I am today. Even if that person isn't infintely different, I'm somehow changed; and those people--they've become a part of me.    I think that everyone who went to JSA is a selfless person. Guys, to you, I have to say- we gave up a month with those we held most dear to cut ourselves off and study, and we gave up a part of our lives-we gave up parts of ourselves, but in the end, we came out better for it, with a greater understanding of the world, and with parts of ourselves dedicated to those we met and taking away a memory of each person with whom we've crossed paths.    Okay, pause.com, I don't want to be totally sappy here, but I can't help it too much. I'm surprised. I thought they were just exagerating when they said you'd make friends of a lifetime and have an unforgettable experience. I thought one month couldn't possibly change a person to such a degree. I thought one month couldn't make such unforgettable memories, unforgettable friends, and a room without AC in the summer which I would cry in leaving. After graduation, it all sunk in. I didn't want to cry, and I promised myself I wouldn't, but then I said goodbye, even though people say it's just "I'll see you later,"--the sad thing is that for most of us, it's not that we'll see one another later, but that we'll simply talk to keep in touch if we do at all, and it will never come close to spending all day together, working, living, laughing together for hours.    I said goodbye to my twin from TN. I said goodbye to the crazy cheese country girl. I said goodbye to my insane, passionate, sweet little roommate. I said goodbye to the driven twin who wants to go to West Pointe. I said goodbye to the crazy, looking people up on Yahoo boy from NY. I said goodbye to the cute little guy from TX. I said goodbye to my professors who were absolutely amazing. I said goodbye to my "omg, she' s out of control, pause.com" RA. I said goodbye to the insane Jamaican girl. I said goodbye to my floor. I said goodbye to the boy who touched my heart in ways he'll never know. Hell, I even said goodbye to the Kentucky and Mississippi boys.    And it all saddened me. I cried hugging people goodbye. It was overwhelming, and I don't know exactly why it was so difficult, so I came up with the idea that I was so upset in saying goodbye because I didn't want to believe it was true. I didn't to believe that after letting these people into my heart for a month, I'd have to say goodbye. Well, it was true, and I'll get over it, because I'm sure we'll talk. We have to talk, but the problem is that we won't actually see one another for some time. Awww...I have to stop. This is making me sadder than ever.   So I don't know. I guess I want to say thanks to everyone for making my month an undeniably integral part of my development and growthas a person. I want to say thanks, and I dont' know what other word could express what you've all done for me. You're all amazing people, so don't ever forget it.   I plan to see you all "turning the world upside down and molding it to your liking," like Dunkar always said. I plan to see you all again. But no matter what happens or whereI goin life, I'll always remember my times at JSA.   And if you think that's sappy, well keep it to yourself. Because you can't possibly understand until you've lived it. I have lived it, so I get it. This place is now ours. We are now each others' in a special way. I'll miss you all.
