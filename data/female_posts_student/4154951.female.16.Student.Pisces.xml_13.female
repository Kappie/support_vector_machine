Um, I got around to starting my S assignment...  yesterday ! I'm gonna go home early today: 1) to get out of the subjects I hate and 2) to finish my SC assignment, which is due  tomorrow !! I hate procrastinating so much, but I really can't help it.. I'm definitely starting my religion assignment tomorrow.. (Let's see if I keep  that  promise..)  >oP      I have a free 3rd period! My math teacher's away again...woooooooo-fookin-hoooooo! >oD  I should work on my S assignment during that period.. *strokes chin and does the weirdo eyebrow thing*      Ooh, Daniel Belle made it into the Top 12 of Australian Idol! (Is it top  12 ?) And I didn't even have to vote! I just saved 55cents, woo! >oP  He's so cool... I was so nervous while waiting for his name to be announced instead of Liza's. (Don't get me wrong, I like Liza, it's just that I   love   Daniel.) My brain could have exploded. *makes a pic of Daniel for her phone's wallpaper*  Ooh, I sense an unhealthy obsession..      My ITS teacher is right in front of me.. He hates me so much.. Maybe I should start doing work.. or stop coming to class. Or hire a hitman.      Useless Camille Fact #947: The highest note I can hit is G, lowest is C. (Or is it the other way around?)
