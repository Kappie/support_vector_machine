Th  e usual sleepy rumours spinning back to June and July and spit, regret-filled talk about the upcoming CBA expiration have made this offseason so far the calm before the storm. Except for spitting up hail, winds and water though, I'm thinking it'll evoke panic about what to do on Saturday nights, why hockey's completely disappeared and how to get a fix of it. I'm actually looking fowards to going to see some OHL games in my area, although I'd look forward to it more and allow myself to get emotionally involved if there were any Sens prospects playing in the OHL. On that segway ...       Meszaros will be playing for the Vancouver Giants of the WHL . Andrej Meszaros, the 1st round pick of the Senators in this year's 2004 NHL Entry Draft, has decided to play for the Vancouver Giants. This comes upon speculation that he'd be staying to play in the Slovakian League (a better league in terms of quality -- the elite league in Slovakia). Chara did the same, and I think a year of North American hockey can't be detrimental to Meszaro's development.       Chara, Phillips and Schaefer re-signed at 2 yrs/$9 mil, 4 yrs/$8 mil and 2 yrs/$2.5 mil.  None of the contract terms are particularly unexpected. However, Chara's signing does leave Ottawa with the possible free-agency of both Chara  and  Redden, at the same time. Could the club be forced to choose between them? It's a chilling idea. Schaefer is a useful player and I expect him to continue his development. I'm still puzzled to as why Burke really had to beg for a 4 year contract from Schaefer. Muckler still has two RFA players left to sign: Varada, who is expected to accept his qualifying offer, and Havlat, who, unforgettably, missed several games last season due to his absence of a contract. He still has no arbitration rights, but his point-per-game season begs for a raise. Currently, the Senators payroll stands at around $37 mil.      In other less important news, Toronto's AHL franchise, the St. John's Maple Leafs, will be moving to Toronto for the 2005-2006 season. I'm still torn as to if I should go to to all the Binghampton-Toronto games to check up on Bochenski and Emery, but put money in the pockets of MLSE, or if I should just stick to the OHL and read second-hand accounts of Bochenski and Emery's accomplishments. Also, it's certain that it won't be the most friendly atmosphere for a road-team fan, with the presence of Leaf fans who couldn't afford tickets to see the real Leafs and being pissed off about it, etc.       Alternate hockey : World Cup of Hockey news - Hannan replaces Blake (foot), Th√©odore replaces Belfour (back). Apparently, talks are on for a player-organized 11-team tournament, featuring Hasek (and other players, but none that are important). The chance for Hasek to gain some valuable game experience and not hurt his groin is golden.       Social events : Alfie got married in Sweden. (Confirmed by media outlets) Bonk got drunk on a golf course and renounced his Senator-ship. (First-hand retelling)
