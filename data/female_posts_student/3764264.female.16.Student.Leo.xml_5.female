I want to put my arms across his and feel his tounge licking my jaw.        I want him to hold me tight against his body so I can't turn around... I want him to whisper in my ear how much he wants me. I want him to undo my pants and push his hand under my panties... His fingerssearching uncomfortably until he finds the spot. i want him to slide a finger in and then another, moving in and out and pushing forward inside me. I want his hand to move up my shirt to find that I didn't wear a bra today. *smiles* To play with my nipple until it gets hard and run the palm of his hand over it. I want him topush me against him and his cock (oh god that word is sexy, cock) so I can feel itpushing back atme. I want him to pull his fingers out of me and tell me to suck on them. And I want to suck on them as he sucks my neck. I want to suck on them like I suck on my finger when I'm horny and need something in my mouth. Pushing the fingerswith my toungeso that they curve and and conform to the roof of my mouth, gulping all the saliva and juice *blushes* to the back of my throat to be swallowed.        I want him to turn me around quickly and kiss me. Push on my tounge like I did his fingers. Wrap one arm around my waist and pull me tightly against his body, while the other runs through my hair and down my neck, across some newly formed hickeys.        Iwant him to pull away from me and smile, opening the door as I do my pants back up and lead me out by the hand to wherever the hell he wants to take me.      ...    holy.... That got a bit more kinky than I meant it to. *smiles* I hope its not a bad thing. I have many more fetishy fantasies that are much *cough* worse than that. Like my little... submissive quirk I have...... *blush* Though if you read hard enough, you see a bit of that in these thoughts as well...        But reading hard is alot of work. are you sure you're up to it, proverbial person? Proverbial because if theres someone writing, it's assumed that someone reads the garbage they put out. hehe.        Oooooo... I want someone pushing down on me. That made my stomach turn over...      Anway. Back to whatever the hell I was talking about. Erich. Erich erich erich erich erich erich. *smiles*        Oh dear. Now I'm thinking too much. I better leave.        --Sage        PS: "I want to mount you" -- Anchorman    PPS: I've had this weirdthought about shopping and buying bondage pants with Erich. (Not pants used for bondage, pants with buttons and zippers and chains and whatnot) I hate shopping. Weird...
