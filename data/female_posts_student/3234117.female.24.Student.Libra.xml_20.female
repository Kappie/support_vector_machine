June 7, 2004 â€” When Chad Taylor noticed his son was apparently experiencing serious side effects from Ritalin prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, he decided to take the boy off the medication. Now, he says he may be accused of child abuse.   This is absolutely absurd I think! Clearly some children do better taking psychotropic drugs such as Ritalin and because of the medicine, maintain a more controlled life style.  However, not all children are lucky enough to be side effect free and while they may be able to concentrate more and be more controllable, their phsyical health could be deteriorating.  So basically what is most important is the manageable child, not the healthy child.  And it's even more ridiculous to fine or send the parents to jail for not medicating their children.
