I didn't go to rehearsal for marching because I didn't want to be packing at like 11:30 when I get home tonight then leave at like..4:00 in the morning. That would suck big time. :(  Today was actually a really good day. It probably helped that it was the last day of such a crappy week. I have an A in history...I'm not sure how and Carson and I did an interpretive dance on Kafka's, The Metamorphosis. It was a lot of fun. I wasn't going to do it but then I gave in and went with it.   I really do need to go pack though. I'm kind of sad I wont get to see anyone this weekend. Ohh well. Maybe Tuesday since we have no school. :)
