(say that in a hick accent). i feel bad for the cats. the dad, keith,charlottes dad, scares the crap outta me. he never smiles either. man, i hate that family. im seriously considering quitting. i need the money though. im not going to babysit as much next month though...i get to babysit the cool baby more! yay! next week, i might call peter and the rest of our little league of losers and bring the kid down to the park- nick wants to go- and show them the golem- from- lord- of- the- rings-look-alike. they wanted a picture but i dont want to spend money on a camera that's just going to break....if you catch my drift.
