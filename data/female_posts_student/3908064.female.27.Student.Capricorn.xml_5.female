I made promise after promise and convinced them that playing the violin would make my life complete. Either they believed me at some point or got sick of my pleadings, but they broke down. We went to the music store and purchased a brand new $300 instrument. All that I had said was true...for a good year or so. I played that instrument day in and day out, but my little mind wanted something more.  Last Sunday night, I went to Rock Harbor church in Costa Mesa where the main message went through the seventh commandment (isn't it interesting how we number the commandments), "thou shalt not commit adultery." The message geared into the direction of lust and what struck me about it was that it brought out three points: lust is never satisfied, it takes away from legitimate desires, and it imprisons. The point that really stuck out to me was the first.  I think, often, Christians, talk about how God fulfills every need...He is everything and completes us, but I wonder how much that is lived out. I wonder how much we actually allow for God to fulfill, whether that fulfillment comes from people around us or His own provisions...or are we convinced that we know what fulfills us?  When I was a little girl, I was convinced that it was the violin...now that instrument sits in a garage somwhere, untouched, unplayed...when I look back, I know there are many things in my life that I have left untouched and unplayed...I wonder what it would have been like if I trusted that God would provide the more that I searched for. I often wonder how I would have enjoyed playing the violin today.
