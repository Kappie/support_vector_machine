Going back to malaysia........i could sense that my body and mind was tired when i was travelling back to msia.......but kinda happy reaching home....my heart was really joyful and i was seriously smilling from my heart....this is my homeland after all.....Ivory is picking me up...she is definitely a really worthy friend!!!!  Was happy to see all my family members but definitely could feel that my heart was searching for Oscar all the time!!!!!!! I just miss him so much....wept definitely after seeing photos of him passing away.......those images will never be erased from my heart.... :(  Had to do so many things in malaysia.....i did it voluntarily.......had to apply for visas...US visa worries me but it was a huge relief that i found that i could get it within a day!! hooray!!! Then next on my list...Japan air ticket!! hehehe  In malaysia, i never had a holiday/ break for myself.....i was tired everyday......but going to Japan...though i chose to go there for almost 2 weeks....my family is complaining that i am spending too much time out there but it's all worth it as i finally feel that i am back to a healthy state of mind!!! .......it was in Osaka that i felt really relaxed....the holiday pace was really good....had enough time to sleep yet adequate time to play.......
