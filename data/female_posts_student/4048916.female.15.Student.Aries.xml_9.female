I had to exclude my mixed cds and a sevendust album which I got for free and don't know anything off.  Here's my final list, for those of you playing at home. Feel free to create your own compilation using these songs ...   Song - Artist (Album)  (I Could Only) Whisper your name - Harry Connick Jr (She) Afterglow - Taxiride (Garage mahal) Almost Over - Limp bizkit (Results May Vary) Angels - Robbie Williams (Life thru a lens) Autumn Goodbye - Britney Spears (Baby one more time) Back for good - Take That (Greatest Hits) Beautiful - Christina Aguilera (Stripped) Beauty Queen - Lash (The Beautiful and the Damned) Black Betty - Spiderbait (Tonight alright) Burning Up - Kylie Minogue (Fever) Celebration - Kylie Minogue (Greatest Hits) Cup of coffee - Garbage (Beautiful Garbage) Dancing Queen - Kylie Minogue (Intimate and Live) Day that I die - Good Charlotte (The Young and the Hopeless) Did it again - Kylie Minogue (Impossible Princess) Do it with Madonna - The Androids (Self - Titled) Don't Speak - No Doubt (Tragic Kingdom) Drift and Die - Puddle of Mudd (Come Clean) Especially for you - Kylie Minogue (Enjoy Yourself) Everybody (Backstreet's back) - Backstreet Boys (Backstreet's Back) Everybody get up - Five (Self - Titled) Evolution - Crashpalace (Self - Titled) Fall Your Way - Pete Murray (Feeler) Family Portrait - Pink (Missundaztood) Follow Me - Uncle Kracker (No stranger to shame) Hella good - No Doubt (Rock steady) how you remind me - Nickelback (Silver side up) Hunter - Dido (No Angel) je ne sais pas pourquoi - Kylie Minogue (Kylie) Keep on moving - Five (Invincible) Kids - Robbie Williams (Sing when you're winning) Larger than life - Backstreet Boys (Millennium) Like a stone - Audioslave (Self - Titled) Losing my religion - REM (In time (the best of REM)) Love to love you - The Corrs (Forgiven, Not Forgotten) Mascara - Killing Heidi (Reflector) Me  My Monkey - Robbie Williams (Escapology) Mmm bop - Hanson (Middle of Nowhere) Mr lover lover - Shaggy (Mr Lover Lover (the best of Shaggy part 1)) One for sorrow - Steps (Step one) Promises - Shannon Noll (That's what I'm talking about) Running with scissors - Ben Lee (Hey You, Yes You) Shocked - Kylie Minogue (Rhythm of Love) Simple Kind of Life - No Doubt (Return of saturn) Somewhere I belong - Linkin Park (Meteora) Spinning around - Kylie Minogue (Lightyears) Stop - Spice girls (Spiceworld) The Crowd - The Cat Empire (Self - Titled) The Zephyr Song - Red Hot Chili Peppers (By the way) Tragedy - Steps (steptacular) Turn back time - Aqua (Aquarium) What do I have to do? - Kylie Minogue (50+1) When something is wrong with my baby - John Farnham (Anthology 1) Where the wild roses grow - Kylie Minogue and Nick Cave (Hits +) White flag - Dido (Life For Rent) Who do you think you are? - Spice girls (Spice) Who the hell are you - Madison Avenue (The polyester embassy)  Yeah - that's 57 albums not including a Sevendust CD, compilations, soundtracks and the numerous burnt CDs I've accumilated.
