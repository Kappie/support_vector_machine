We just have to pass one for my stomach to start doing flips.  Are we doing the DI thing on Saturday or not?  I would post this on the DI blog, except the whole no access thing kinda sucks.  Je ne sais quias, all.  I don't know if I spelled that right, and I know it doesn't mean what I want it to, but it's the only French phrase I know, and since Josh and Abby use French all the time, I thought I would too.  And now we're a dialogue.  w00t.  And yes, you diid spell monologue right.
