(rolls eyes) I'm going to send Travis and Joey over to the other place to break down the bunk beds and finish up Joey's room. Considering each time I tried to send them over to do something there they always got side tracked. I'm sick of doing it alone. I pack, load some and unpack while everyone is busy playig video games, talking to neighbors or kicking back relaxing. Travis and Tony got to "distroy" the dishes from the old place. It was a good release for them. Otherwise things are ok. Today the rest of it should be done at least in Joey's room and the kitchen and livingroom. My room there is very little left to do. I will have that done tomorrow.    I saw my sisters new place. Pictures of it at least in Blackfoot Idaho. She said that she is thinking of buying a couple of rentals and if she does then she said that me and the boys can move out there. She asked how long it would take me to be ready to move. Umm tomorrow LOL.. I think it would be good to get out of here. I"m losing faith in so much in life but I am trying to hold on. Idaho would be a nice fresh start if A.C. doesnt come home to me. I dont know anymore. I just want to curl up and not think about it. But I know I have to. I want to have faith, I try to have faith but sometimes I get overwhelmed and realize I cant put my trust in faith and good intentions. What is the old saying ?? lol.. Anyway I have to go and kick kids in the butt to do things.
