You have been glorified and idealized in my mind, as I've filled in all the details I didn't know about you with what I would choose if I could. You're my ideal, and I live every day with the tinyspark of hope that someday, perhaps not today, and perhaps not tomorrow, but someday, I'll see you again. But that's not possible, because you'renot  real . You don't exist. You're a figment of my runaway imagination. Yes, you're somewhere out there, but you're not who I think you are. Were I tofind you, I think I'd beterribly disillusioned, and I don't wish that for either myself or you. So thank you for making me want to write. Thank you for being my inspiration. Thank you for giving me a love of piano, Chicago, poetry, and music. Thank you for teaching me how to hope. Thank you for changing my lifewithinthe four days that we spoke. Thank you, and good-bye. I need to be able to look at the stars without wondering if you're doing the same. I need towant to move to Chicago because I love the city, not becauseyou live there.I need to write about  my  life, as it is, not as I wish it would be. I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. I need to experience life without wishingI was sharing it with you. I need to be able to listen to music, to read poetry, to sing, to laugh, to  live  without thinking of you.         . . . what you are to me, I do not need.
