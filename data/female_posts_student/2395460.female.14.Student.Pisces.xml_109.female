Doc Martens, because VH-1 has fired up their time machine to take us way way way back to that time long gone in their newest "nostalgia" series,  urlLink I Love the 90s . The shows air tonight and tomorrow.  Coming soon, re-live Y2K! Buy bottled water and wait for the world to end in a  urlLink tuna-filled disaster bunker .
