Whenever we are faced with something trully horrible, if we are able to survive it, we come out stronger.  Now that is almost cliche`, but that doesn't make it any less true. Think about building muscle... You have to rip apart the tissue so it can rebuild itself larger and stronger.  Life sometimes seems to wanna rip the heart right out of you. Don't hold that against her because, Life, she has gifts to give as well.  Take sunshine on a foggy window; have you ever seen the like? The light is diffused in magnificent but tiny rainbows, shapes more intricate than snowflakes band together on the glass.   Then as the fog begins to melt into bright beads that run races to the sill, sunlight pours in and warms your face, igniting dust into a million small fires that with a swipe of the hand become fairies dancing crazily in swirls!  There are things of wonder all around you, draped in a cloak of common. You would do well to find at least one a day.   Now i don't go around asking Life for  more  hardships (i am not a  complete  idiot... only partially) but I appreciate that we can be given a gift for having survived.
