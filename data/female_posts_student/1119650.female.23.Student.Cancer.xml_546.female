No one is gonna come to the building to conduct business today and if they do I will pelt them with things.  I hope you're happy that you've forced everyone to come in.  If it continues to snow and you're not gonna let us out early you lose your cool status, even if you did work for the Gemini space program.  Rar.  This is not how we start the day.    Kthxdie, Gwen
