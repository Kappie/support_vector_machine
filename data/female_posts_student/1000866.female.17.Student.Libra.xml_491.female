It's really weird. It's like...so tiny and it caused me so much pain. Only like...9 mm. I'm still not feeling great yet, mostly because all the drugs in my system haven't warn off yet. I'm pretty dizzy and light headed, but I guess it's not bad.  I'm really glad Chris called though. It was nice to get out of the house and just hang out with him. We watched two, "that 70's Show"  episodes. It's a good show. Very funny.   I feel so weird right now though. Like...I'm not in control of myself. Ahhh, I don't like it...
