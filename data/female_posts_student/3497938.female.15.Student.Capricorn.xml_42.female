Then we went to the church at 8 and worked at the food pantry. After that Drew went home and me and Lauren and Rusty stayed at the church all day. I hung out with the day camp and watched 'The Ring'. That is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. But it was good, tho. Then i was in the nursery for the meeting. It was sooooo hecktic. Today I just chilled out and went swimming. Tomorrow night we are going to see the Awkward Romance play. I have been thinking alot about everything going on. I miss being friends with Kayla. She is the person I could come to about tampons, boy problems, anything. I miss not having her there. I dont know what else to do. I senther an e-mail apologizing. So, whatever happens... happens. Im so happy for Amanda and Terry. They are finally together, well they have been together for a while and im just posting about it. They are sooo cute. *lol* Im in love with Drew. He makes me soo happy, but then he makes me sooo mad sometimes. But, thats just him. *lol* My grandparents are making me go to this stupid driving thing next week. That sucks. Well, thats about it.  HEY MARK!!! There, you're in here. *lol, honeybee*
