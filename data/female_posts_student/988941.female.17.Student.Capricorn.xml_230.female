Spent most of my evening staring at my music coursework hopeing that a melody will pop out from somewhere and write its self onto a page - no such luck so far.  What a day hey? Robin Cook (British Cabinet minister and Leader of the House of Commons) resigns, UN staff at the Kuwait-Iraq border move out along with all UN staff inside Iraq. Russia and Portugal tell their staff to leave Iraq while diplomatic staff from other countries begin to leave the country. George W. Bush is going to issue a speach tonight where he will make a final ultimatum to Saddam. We are going to war. Now I ain't gonna go on about this for ages, but I am starting to be pro-war. If we stop now, he's just going to come after us in future years and probably cause a lot of damage. The people in Iraq are in great trouble and need help, what can we do? Sit around and wait to get blown up or gased, or actually stop him before he gets rid of us. Just the ice-cream talking probably, but still.  Now this is pathetic,  urlLink Dogbreath ad is withdrawn , "A TV advertisement featuring a man "vomiting" up a live dog has been pulled after record complaints from viewers ... chewing gum manufacturer Wrigley's decided to withdraw the advertisement, for its X-cite brand of gum, after watchdog Independent Television Commission (ITC) received more than 700 complaints ... 'Parents have been complaining that their children are scared by it, and some of the adults have said they were actually sick themselves after watching it'." I'm sorry, but that is pathetic, that advert is not disgusting or horrible, you barely even see anything at all apart from a dog jumping out of somebodies mouth. It isn't sick, and it's a fairly amusing advert. It didn't make me laugh, but at least it isn't as dull as Persil or a debt helper.  Anyway, this  urlLink Steve Bell cartoon  sort of sums up todays events to a certain extent. G'night.
