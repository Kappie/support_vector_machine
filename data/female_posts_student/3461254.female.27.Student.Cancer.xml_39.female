It's been about 15 years since I put myself through the agony of watching this; I'm not planning on watching it anytime soon.  I remember going to see this with Kate and our cousin Karen.  I vividly remember Kate sobbing in the ladies room at Eastland Theater "Why did ET have to go home?!?!?"  As far as alien movies go, I prefer "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."    E.T.!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
