But last night, I managed to snag a good night's sleep, so I'm up with a little extra time this morning, so I put on the news.  And I must admit that I am disturbed by what I see.  Or rather, what I don't see.  Let me preface this by saying that I know this is an election year.  And I know that the outcome of this election is very important, possibly more important than any election since 1860.  But it is certainly not important for the reasons the news seems to suggest.  For example, when I turn on the news, they're talking about the 9/11 Commission mess.  Now, I believe that it is important to know what was known, and when it was known.  But I don't think it really matters for the here and now.  And I don't think it says anything about future action.  Everyone was caught by surprise on 9/11.  Should it have been surprising?  Perhaps not.  But it was.  Hindsight is 20/20 and for anyone to say now that the administration knew exactly what was going to happen and dropped the ball is silly.  Let's not forget that there was eight years of Clinton's Presidency, and four years of Bush's father, and so on, for however far you think we should go back, not to mention all the Congressmen who have access to intelligence information.  I say this not to blame anyone, because I think trying to assign blame after the fact is just wrong.  Or, more accurately, I think trying to assign the blame to anyone in any administration or in the government here after the fact is just wrong.  Finding out what happened is one thing, but what's more important is what has been done afterwards, after the threat has fermented itself and seared itself on all our imaginations.    There is only one thing to blame for 9/11 and that is terrorism; and only one group to blame, and that is al-Qaeda, and those that supported them and other terrorist groups.  And having been awakened to the terror threat wholly and fully, and not just by foggy intelligence info and rumors, the Bush administration has largely risen to the call.    I fear that all these distractions mean that Americans are getting complacent, that terrorism is no longer a fear of most of them, nor a major issue that they plan on voting on.  For me, it is the main, and probably sole, issue I will vote on, because I think that if this war is not handled properly, then the rest of it doesn't really matter.  That doesn't mean that terrorism should be the only thing people talk about.  I think there are plenty of other issues out there worth discussing, and discussing robustly at that.  But I also think we should not lose sight of what is really most important of all, and that is preventing another 9/11, and ending as best as possible the terror threat that is spreading across the globe.  And these things should be prioritized accordingly.  But I have no hope that they will be.  I fear that only the worst can refocus people's attention, and then it will largely be too late.  For the best lesson we can learn from 9/11 is that the threat is real, and it can hit us at any time.  And the best lesson we can learn from knowing what was known in the months and years before 9/11 is not to lay the blame at someone's feet, but to know how to read such information we might get in the future, because prevention is the goal.  That, and eradication.    I hope I'm wrong.  I hope people can be re-convinced of the importance of this without another attack.  But there's already been another attack, the bombings in Spain, and that didn't seem to refocus anyone too much, so I won't be holding my breath.
