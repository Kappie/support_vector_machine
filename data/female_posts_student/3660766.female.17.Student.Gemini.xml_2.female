Well krissy and i get front row and we sitting in these seats, well the guy kept going around and checking the other side to see if their seats locked, and didnt check ours. My latch thingy def. didnt lock but everyone elses did, so its like really loose and moving around. I called the guy over and he was saying something when he walked away, i thought maybe he was gonna fix it, NO THE IDIOT started the RIDE! so i was like KRISSSSSSY! and she was like omg omg omg, so we start getting higher and at this point we arent upside down yet but we are close, im holding on to this chest bar thing like its a fucking fudge bar and i aint letting go. Well we get upside down and the fucker decides to keep us upside down for like 2 mins. im holding on, crying, and screaming and other people are screaming too but they are doing it bc they are retards. So n e ways, the ride starts to end and i get off, and my shoulders are like killing me bc i was holding on so tight that the bar was resting on my shoulders so i wouldnt fall. i get home, and look at my shoulders, i have blood blisters on them. thats the last time im ever gonna ride a fair ride that goes upside down!
