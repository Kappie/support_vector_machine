No wonder I have little strength. But I'm guessing I have no choice, Can't have my own voice.  Why am I so torn? I try to be happy, but inside I'm sad. I let on I'm fine, but I want a better life, A better home, that I'll gladly claim. Take me in, comfort the sin of wanting to leave. Am I alone?  ............Yea..so, I can't remember the rest of it off the top of my head...but next time we're hangin out n there's a piano in our presense, I'll play it for ya...I'm still havin difficulties w/ "Why do I Bother" n it's tickin me off...grr! lol...so yea...on w/ the show...g'night
