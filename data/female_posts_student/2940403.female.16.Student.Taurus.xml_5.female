    
       I'm sick of feeling like this.  I'm sick of my mom telling me the shit she does to try to get me to feel better, when I already know everything she's suggesting.  I'm sick of my sister, who I hate (at most times) with every fiber in my body.  I'm sick of being told to forget her, but I can't when she's sleeping in the next room, or walking all over me telling me how disgusting and worthless I am.  She's a waste of my could-have-been college tuition.  She's a liar, and a selfish fuck.  I'm sick of trying to fix it and make our relationship better.  I give up.  I won't... I can't take this shit anymore.  I'm sick of my mom thinking my threats at leaving are empty, even as I scream them at her with tears rolling down my cheeks.  She refuses to recognize the problem, and I continue to suffer because of it.  I won't continue with these empty threats forever, I have other places I can go.       Someday soon I will break... and it will be too late for anyone to help.
