Nope, there was no fast trip to the emergancy room for me. It was an hour and a half visit with her, my doctor, though. She was totally paronoid. She kept researching into my family history for like different diseases or whatever. She was completely convinced thatI was about to die before her eyes. It was a complete waste of time, I tell you.  The bad part about this physical, despite lack of entertainment, was that I found out that I'm in the 75th percentile for my age.I know that I've developed faster then most people my age but that doesn't make it suck any less. God, why can't I get any skinnier? I don't eat junk food. I don't drink soda. I barely eat meat anymore. Why am I SO fat? Okay, maybe I'm not fat but I feel fat, 0kay? People online are all telling me that I'm fine and that I'm not overweight or anything but sometimes it is just SO hard to believe what they're saying. I barely ever feel trim. I know that people who are overweight and hate it are probably like really angry at me but I can't help what I feel. Every time I eat something I feel really, REALLY bad. I know that I need to eat more, since I fainted and all but it's hard now. I haven't ever ate right in my entire life. It's sort of scary to eat a lot now. I know that I'm supposed to eat a lot of nutritional stuff... It's just different, okay?  My friend, Katelyn, is way overweight. My other friend, Chloe, is way underweight. I guess I'm sort of the balance in between the two, though I'm getting pretty close to being overweight myself. It sort of feels awkward being around both of them. I mean, I can't exactly talk to them about how I feel 'cause they'll get all snappish.   They'll something like, "Well, try being my size. Trust me, you don'twant to know what it feels like."  They both hate the way they are. Right now I'd give anything to be either. I hate being in the middle of things. It's just really annoying. Like, Katelyn sometimes talks to me about how she's fat and all and I'm not allowed to say a word 'cause it'll make her feel bad and stuff.  Maybe I'm not that fat, I'm probably stressing this way too much. Either way, I'm hitting the pool.  See you later alligator.
