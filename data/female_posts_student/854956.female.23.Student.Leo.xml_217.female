And GOOD LUCK to all those that are taking finals... I miss seeing Shawn's little icon on AIM at Finals time... You know... the one with the devil (appropriately labeled "finals") and a poor little guy getting it in the ass from the devil (fantastically labeled "me").... *sigh*  Those are some good finals studying memories... ;)
