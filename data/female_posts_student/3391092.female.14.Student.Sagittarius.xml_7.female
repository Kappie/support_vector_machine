Thursday: Okay finally today well i woke up and my brother was downstairs on the couch and i was upstairs and he yelled for me to come to the stairs so we could talk and then i was in the kitchen lookin for something to eat and then i go "hey dan do you realize that theres a jamba juice up there" and he was like "yeah... no S***" and blah blah and then he told me i was fat and that i should walk down there and get a smoothie cuz i havent like excersised in FOREVER... so i walk down there and its like drizzling... it only took like 3 minutes to walk up there and then i walked back and yeah. When my dad got home he asked me to sign him up for this one thing online and i didnt know how and he was like who r u on the fone with and i go joe and he was like oh well ur on the fone with joe your useless and he was just being a dickhead. and then like he just left and went food shopping and he came home and i was like why didnt you take me and he goes cuz u were on the fone and i go so i could of hung up and he was like well i didnt think of it and like i had told him yesterday to not go shopping with out me cuz he doesnt buy any food that me and my brother EAT! and like hes so fucking gay he goes "then go shopping by urself tomorrow" okay how the hell could i go FOOD shopping with no car and no money? ... hes frusterating! and he owes me a 100 bucks!....................................haha my dad is lame he went back and took me shopping to buy what i wanted to eat! lol what a loser  Kayla called me to see what i wanted to do and we decided to go bowling and Joe and his cousin emily came with us. It was hella fun just all hanging out and stuff. Kaylas dad cracked the funniest joke as we were leaving though....good times good times..
