I worked 3 to 10 tonight, and it was busier than expected and the new girl doesnt seem to understand that talking on the phone for an hour is not acceptable.   There is a slight (but serious) miscommunication between a few people which includes the assumption that i drove myself home drunk a couple weeks ago. Which entirely is not factual. here are a few reasons: - i dont drink - even if i did choose to drink, i had friends with me that would take possesion of my keys before i even thought of putting my shoes on to leave the house. (thank you mike)  - lastly, im more intellegent than that.   just thought i'd clear that up.   And much love goes to jamie for lookin out for me and making sure that i get punched in the face if that would ever happen =D thanks!   I'm off to finish modern global. nighty night all   $ kuff $
