It's just that I'm really quite excited about the news and have to share the excitement.  Yay.    The law school released the class standings this afternoon, and here's where this gal fell.  We'll start with a bit of backstory, as usual:  Fall Semester GPA: 2.83 Fall Semester standing: 41/98 Fall Semester section standing: 21/48  Now let's get to the best fucking news ever:  Spring Semester GPA: 3.45 Spring Semester Standing: 5/98 (the whole class) Spring Semester Section Standing: 4/48 (just my section [half the class])  And move to the big picture:  Cumulative GPA: 3.19 Cumulative Standing: 18/98 Cumulative Section Standing: 8/48   Sigh.  I still can't quite believe it, but I also can't seem to get this grin off my face.  Nice way to kick off the weekend.
