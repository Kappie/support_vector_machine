Which SUCKS cause I think my aunt is coming down on Friday, and I'd like her to see.   My auntie Jen called mom today, and Auntie jen like, never calls us, so it's a big deal. So me and greg were bugging Mom to find out why. Mom's all like, no biggie, Jen just heard that Donna and Basil might be coming down on friday, but I haven't heard anything, so... FREAK OUT!! I'm so superly excited, cause Donna's my favorite aunt ever. So scream. I'd just like to have my hair dyed before then, but I don't think it's gonna happen, so whatever.  Yaaaay jess! I'm so excited now. We'll have such a blast. We'll make a girl's ..day out of it :) SCREAM.
