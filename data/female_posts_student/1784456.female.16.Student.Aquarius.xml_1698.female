Emma's got Ken... *sigh* Guess I'll just have to get Ken to set me up with a guy... *shiver* Hehe (So isn't thinking of sending Emma a valentines ecard from Ken) Yup... (Isn't checking out if they do them) AHHHH! Phew, breathe breathe. Geez the Barbie website's scary. It's like kids get brainwashed, like they're coming out of a factory pre-programmed to want to grow up, get married, have children, and die quietly. Nope, maybe not the life for me. I'm gonna die kicking and screaming! (Hopefully that won't be because someone's trying to strangle me)
