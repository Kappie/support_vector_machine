So anyway if you do read this, then hmmm... i can't do a thumbs up, but that's what I'm doing to the screen so just imagine it in your head. How come my thing doesn't look as good as Angela's?!! Bloody hell. And why don't the school computers don't even let me get into my MSN group? Oh yeah, join my group:  urlLink http://groups.msn.com/allhailme  Yeah. I joined Angela's forum about manga and crap. What the hell? I can't even do anything on it. They tell me off for doing nothing!! Stupid mods. It's even worse than gaia. Yeah I'm in IT again. I have one of these thingys on Xanga and I can't remember how to post. Anyway, gotta go and do maths. yay. what fun!! Kimo
