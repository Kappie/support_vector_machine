Its midterm, meaning that life here at Valdosta State Univ. could not be any crazier. Lets see, 18 hrs of class(by the way my major is Public Relations), Valdosta Symphony Orchestra Concert Manager, assistant for the European Council of the University System of Georgia at International Programs here at VSU, Blazin Brigade Marching Band, Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity for Women, and the Christian Student Center... yeah, its keeping me busy. I actually like being busy. First of all, it keeps me out of trouble. Second, if I wasn't busy, I'd be bored, and that's worse, and third, why not? I have the rest of my life to work at a desk. I may as well take advantage of all the things I can while I'm at college. Granted, I do spend alot of time at my desk, at my computer, but its okay. It is expected. On that note... I believe it is expected to be busy at college. Not just for the whole resume thing, but also for personal growth. I can't even begin to explain the changes I've had since I was an 18 year old freshman. I'll get to that in a later "blurb". For now, this is a start.
