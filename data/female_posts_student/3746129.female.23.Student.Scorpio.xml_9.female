	 
      Alone with thoughts of horrifying yesterdays,  And uncertain tomorrows. Each one suffocating my brain To the point of extinction. Tears well up in eyes too dry for crying. Stinging from the lack of moisture. Immovable words choking me, dying to escape. Memories of sad times  Elude the happy thoughts that never come. Death screams. Itâ€™s calling to the soul that has no future. Mine. Pain fills my heart, and squeezes it whole. Time passes by slowly, Never giving me a chance to reconcile my sorrowed youth. The end seems inevitable. Salvation no longer seems in sight. Drowning in thoughts and choking on words, My turmoil may soon be extinguished.
