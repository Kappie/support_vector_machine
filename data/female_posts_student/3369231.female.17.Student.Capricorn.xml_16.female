I am sorry Sarah, your fiancee didn't show :-P, but Jessica's did.  Todd is whipped.  He just doesn't know it yet.  And they are all running off to Vegas soon to get married.. and I am gonna be a witness.  So woohoo for me!!!  Todd didn't show up for a while... but after we called him and told him that his fiancee was getting irritable that he needed to get his little butt over here.  And you know what... he did.  WOW, he is a good guy.  After that Robby and I stayed for a little while and talked some.. and then we both ended up going to Auto Zone and he got some adhesive for his rear-view mirror that kinda fell off. So I didn't get home till around 6:00 and I left at 1:45 and I only went to Steak and Shake and Auto Zone... good good times.  If you ever go to Steak and Shake get the Frisco Melt.... very very yummy.  And always remember that you can use sour gummy worms to catch the sour gummy fish that TARGET sells... haha, good times, good jokes.  Cause you know that us Target people are awesome and CRAAAAZY!  Haha.  Well, I am off to Subway to get Nick some food cause I am a nice person like that!
