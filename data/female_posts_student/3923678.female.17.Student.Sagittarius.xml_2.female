BUT.. when i was in the lift, i realise that i didnt bring my key. GREAT..!! so had to call my mom and she wasnt free to pick up my call.. hence had to sit at the steps of my door like a fool.  later meet my mom to get keys from her la.. and when i was on my way there, when walking into the lift i could actually knock against the wall.. what was that..? i think i have been curse or something. so irritating.  after i got the key, i went to meet shu wen with her friends sam and serene. i was stoning with shu wen, serene, sam.(alliteration) hahaha.. guess what, i was actually gossiping with them abt my fairfield friends. super dotz lo.. saw quite alot of people at queensway today. ya.   though i feel that i have been cursed and i had the worst day in my life.. but i guess thereare definately other people out there who are much worse off then me la. hmm.. seems like im notthat cynical after all.. hmm.. what do u think..?
