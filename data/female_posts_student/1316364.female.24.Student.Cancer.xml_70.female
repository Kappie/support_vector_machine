W had a nice long chat and I have to say I like talking to her over the phone verses yahoo chat. She seems like a wonderful lady and so loving. She has a daughter who is 7 years old. I just hope that all of the families that were torn apart get to be reunited soon. I hope to keep on talking to her and hopefully I am able to keep her updated on any information I may hear.
