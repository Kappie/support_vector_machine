Plus it'll be just Andrew and I which should be fun.  I'm looking forward to strong booze, duty free airport shopping, Tim Horton's donuts and my dollars being able to go farther!  w00t!  I am however,  not  looking forward to having to fly.  I hate flying.  Aside from just being scared, my sinuses have really been bothering me (I know you *all* needed to know that) and the cabin pressure is prolly gonna make me want to die.     48 days  until my birthday *yayayayyay*  I'll be the big 2-3.  Oooh, how utterly uneventful.  However I'm looking forward to spending the day at the spa being pampered and dinner with friends and family and a bar crawl earlier that weekend to commemorate the greatness that is me.   52.5 days  until I leave this awful job for good!  No more bullshit customers, no more shitty sewer project (no pun intended), no more Outcome based budgeting.  Its a dream come true.   I'm starting to already have the nightmares of getting phone calls from customers.  However, in preparation of my departure I've cut my workload in half and doubled my productivity.  The person I'm training to do my job wants to do everything so they can get accustomed to it, so all my work gets done and I have time to do productive things, like blog or look up outings to go on in Toronto, so its been really helpful in that respect.    I have decided to share the love of the baking bug thats bit me recently so I offer up this deal to you people: if you would like cookies (chocolate chip, sugar or peanut butter) email me your address and I will mail you a dozen cookies free of charge, no strings attached just pick your flavor.  All you have to do is be patient because I only bake on weekends so they won't ship until Monday.  I know I've promised people things in the past, but I was lazy, but now I am constantly baking and constantly at the post office so you're guranteed to get 'em.  I promise they're yummy and all I'd ask is for a little blog love after you get them.  I'm a shameless promowhore like that sometimes.  **Oh, if I don't get your address in time to bake your cookies this weekend you're going to have to wait until after Memorial day (as I previously stated I'll be in Toronto the weekend after next).**
