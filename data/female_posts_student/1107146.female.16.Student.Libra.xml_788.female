Not next to a bunch of loozersauruses jamming to old Metallica in some guy's yellow bedroom for about two hours, then going and setting off fireworks in said person's pocket.  Besides, I think it would be fun to be a full-time vocalist. Not that I can really sing, but that was never in the job description.
