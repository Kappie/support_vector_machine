I love each and everyone to pieces. What I find really odd is that the cats all have names given to them, but yet I can't seem to ever call them by their correct names. They all go by different names to me. So, I think I will just tell ya...  **Murphy-aka-Mr. Murph,Murpa Purpa, and Corpse (since he seems as if he is on his death bed) **Pooder-aka-Poot Ball and Lil Bit**Tiger-aka-Tiger Baby,Tigs, and Tiggy Wiggy**Romy-aka-Romy Love, Precious, Baby Girl,and Sweet Potatoe**P.J.-aka-PeePee, Peepers, and Chokes (since she has some choking issue, I just think there is a massive hairball inside her growing)**Gremlin-aka-Gremy Leonard,Gremis, and Raccoon**Gretchen-aka- Gretchy Sketch, Pookers, Mouser, Mouse Killa, Gertrude, and Geoffery with a G...insider..hehe. Also, poor Gretchen is a boy. But hey, he is neutered so he don't know the difference. I have had pupper doggies in the past. Poor little beagle Maggie-aka-Magger Wagger died about 2 yrs. ago, and then we had a black lab Shia-aka-Shi Pi which was too whack for the family so we gave him away.        Moving on, the warm weather is returning, shucks. I did get out alittle today. I woke up around 11:30 and on the Sci Fi channel they had a marathon of Roswell. Since my sis loves that show and she had control over the remote I watched it too. I kinda like the show. I like the relationships in it,even though its all about aliens not letting there idenities known. But I am romantic type a gal. But to discuss all those issues, thats another blog, another time. So yeah, I sat an watched that til 3. Then I took a shower,yay me, and went to sleep some more until my dad asked me if I wanted to go to Steve and Barry's known to my dad as Ben and Jerrys...sheesh. So we went, he bought some pants and then me being the good girl I am asked to get the new Brownie Batter at Dairie Queen. So we got it of course. It was delicious for being the only thing besides a P.B. and J. sandwich I had today. Yes, once again I am going back to my no eating phase. I seem to have hadalot of compliments of being skinny and so I want to hear it again. But I will eat, here and there, and watch what I am eating. So it's all good. Well, anywho, after that we came home quickly to watch Big Bro 5. My family (besides my sis) is like addicted to it. I know it is just another reality tv show, but this one I actually like. I hate the lying people though. It just shows how evil people are. Well, it was a good show and now its over. So here I sit telling all the nonsense of the day.        Ok, well I am sure I just told nothing of importance to anyone today. But this blog is for me to say anything I want, when I want, or how I want. So if I want to ramble on about nicknames I give to my cats,well so be it. Until tomorrow, I am outtie!        Music Playin' in The Background: Vindicated-Dashboard Confessional
