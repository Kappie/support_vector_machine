Song:Placebo- Every You, Every Me (plac-ebo, not placebo, it's an entirely different band) ('Carve your name into my arm. Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed. Cuz there's nothing else to do, Every me and every you.  Sucker love, a box I choose. No other box I choose to use. Another love I would abuse, No circumstances could excuse.')  I love this song! Mainly coz it reminds me of Ryan Philippe, undoubted god of us all!  'Me- Jessica...Jessica....I'm the voice inside your head Jessica. Jess-What do you want? Me-....I don't know.' Ah don't me and Jess sound like we concentrate in history.  Kay what to say. Well first of all if this doesn't make much sense that is because I am admittedly a tiny bit tipsy. I was given a breezer at my uncles and i thought 'hmmm I need to drink it quick so I can go back and do some on my maths', so i practically downed it in one....then realised that swasn't such a good idea. Oh well cn't be helped, safe to say I haven't done any, i can't even remember what I was gonna do anyway so it's no loss.  Anyways I'm bored and writing a story while my brain is warped and full of ideas...from e-numbers not drink don't worry I'm not that bad. Dani
