Seems to be a riddle I’d like to fill.  What is salvation? And what have I done, To need to wash my soul clean and believe In some prodigal Son?  What is heaven? And why does there need To be a hell? Is one answer I’d like spilled.  Why did Jesus die for me? And how do I get to eternity?  These questions plague non-believers, All those who don’t understand, The gloriousness that is JesusAnd God, creator of this great land.
