I'm so excited about tonight!!!  Nate(ive known him since before kindergarten, he's one of my greatest friends) is coming over tonight and we're going to play with Premiere, Flash, and Bryce! And I get to drive him home at midnight! ooooo...;) I think my parents are actually starting to loosen up on the driving restrictions....I drove them around almost the entire day today, and we weren't yelling at eachother, so thats an improvement :).   Oh and my dress and jewelery are finally all taken care of for prom. My mom is kinda annoyed, she thinks Matt should pay for something, cause hes just been saying we're going to pay 50/50....even though I have to buy a dress, jewelery, shoes, hair-job, makeup etc all for _his_ prom, now i have to pay for dinner and my ticket?....I dont know, I dont need him to pay for everything, but honestly, _he_ asked me, I think he should pay for _something_. Lol, oh and I also have to get him a boutonier (sp?), and I have no idea how or where to get one...my dad said he'd help, but presently is ripping apart my bathroom....*sighs* my parents are always fixing or remodeling something around  our house...  Ah well.
