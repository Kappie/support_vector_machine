Jess bored senseless, and my attemps to chat with an old friend (Not elderly mind you)failed miserably. Spent most of the time checking out his webie. Time for a PLUG!!!!!   Check it out!    urlLink CLCOOL Fonts, wallpaper, and even a bot; It's down though... sucks...   Also, my sister's site!    urlLink The Life and Times of the Princess Bree  It's a great site! Check that out TOO!   Now Jessica is going to type something... I'm scared...    hi. dude.    Yay for Jessssicaaa... She can TALK!... Well... Kinda.    Lets see if she'll say anything else!    no.    Okay then! Yay!    Check it out!   urlLink Chris' *plug*    urlLink Bree's *Plug*     PS: I plug everyone equally on this site!
