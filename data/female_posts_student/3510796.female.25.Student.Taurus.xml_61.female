First I scan the sports, because Im a non girly type of gal.  I already know. Cubs lost to Houston, 3-2.  But there is also an article about  urlLink two new pledges for the Fighting Irish.  .  Lets hope these two make a 'world of difference'.  July 1st, only a few weeks left and it'll be time to Shake Down the Thunder.  Ohhh, cant wait for those posts.    On the food/business front, awhile back Chick-Fil-A (a real classy chicken 'fast food' place) had closed on the south side of town (where I am).  Before they closed, I would take the kids to eat there often.  Getting a little tired of it, I was glad to wait for the new store to be built.  Well folks, that day has come.   urlLink The new store has opened and people went last night to camp out , to be the first in line.  They gave away 52 coupons to each person for a free combo meal.  Thats one per week!!  I may have to get some chicken today.  Yum!    This next part of the post is not going to sit well with some people.  Ive been told to cut the set lists out.  To this I say.....
