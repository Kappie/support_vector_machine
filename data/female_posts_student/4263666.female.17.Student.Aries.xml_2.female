Whta if he and I had gotten serious....I would probably be a mess right now. I guess its sort of a blessing because I wouldnt be worried about him. But I do sometimes miss laughing with him. We should have stayed closer...as friends. Maybe I didnt give him a chance. Maybe he was a great guy and I was the idiot. Or, maybe, I just feel this way because of what Nat told Christina. Who knows....  -j
