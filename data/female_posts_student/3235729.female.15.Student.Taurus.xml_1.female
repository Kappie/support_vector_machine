Cuz there's more to me than you can see...more to me than you could ever see...  -Crowned King's "Farewell" This is such a hypnotic song...you don't even want to being to TRY to know...   Soo. Today I had my regular gay morning classes...late for 1st (as always)...2nd, we had some abuse presentation...3rd, I got my assigned seat (:|) she's like, "Ok Jodi you're supposed to be sitting over there *points*" "Yeah ok...I wasn't here last day so..." "Just go sit over there. Ok class, this is your new seating plan" "...You don't say." haha anyways then in 4th I sat there with Braun laughing over NOTHING it was so gay...then my cell phone kept beeping in my pocket...it doesn't like my pocket apparently because I couldn't figure anything to justify the beeping and it ONLY beeped when it was in my pocket...it was so annoying...and then in 5th I sat there writing out lyrics to random Crowned King songs. Yeah that was my day. Oh yeah and we got kicked out of the cubby because of MARK'S long-term writing!...Bastard. Yeah and then tonight...I believe I am going to get my new bus pass (hoorah) with my mom and then going driving...I should be "happier than a clam in clamtown" as my good pal Lindsay would say...Hmmmm....Yeah and then tomorrow I have drums....Then wed I am supposed to do something with Braun...Yep. Thursday and Friday iunno yet. I'm not for the whole planning 5 weeks ahead soo yeah whatever happens happens I guess....    But yeees I have run out of topics to turn into wonderful bloggedy topics full of CAAANDY, so...I leave you.   -Joebie
