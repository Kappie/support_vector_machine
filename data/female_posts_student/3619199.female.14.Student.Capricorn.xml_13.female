The day before I start school.  Most people dread the actual first day of school, but it's always pre-school anxiety with me. I'm left alone with my own thoughts (and thoughts meaning thinking, and, well thinking is something that is a rarity for me). My mind is in a fragile state right now, and I need some support. Okay I'll cut the crap, basically I'm nervous about starting school. Hm, 'nervous', I don't think that is the right word for this particular emotion, but I really don't know what is. It's indescriable really. I guess I would say that it's kind of like a mixture of dread, nervousness, and ......................maybe even exictement? I don't know why the hell I would be exicted to go back to school. I mean for god sakes this is  high school,  but I swear that I have something in the pit of my stomach.  Butterflies?  No, probably just what I had for lunch. I really shouldn't have had that 6th bag of Doritos, and maybe the moldy bagel was pushing it  That has to be the reason. I don't have any other explanation. Well, any logical one.  I don't know. I just keep thinking that  maybe  this year could be different.  God, I don't want to even think about last year. Being a freshmen.  Why the hell did I think it would be so great. I guess I was too caught up inside the world of teen movies and MTV, to realize what high school was about, and for some reason, Dawson Creek eps. didn't come close.  Freshman year just wasn't what I had planned. I swear to god, I couldn't have made it if it wasn't for the coke machines. The only thing to look forward to was the chance of getting a free Sprite from the machine, or extra change.  Pathetic. I agree.  I'm just hoping for, I guess, a new start this year. I don't know. Maybe I'm starving for attention? I mean to say I go unnoticed is more than an understatement. Bascially, I don't exist. I guess that kind of works in my favor though. I get to  see  a lot of stuff, without being  seen.  I know alot that goes around, because a lot of people don't even notice that I am around.  Wait, why do I care if people care? God, this is just another so-called 'phase' of my teen ridden angst, where I question not only myself, but the world. Hm, I should really stop watching Ricki Lake.  I wish I could go back to kindergarden. I was so oblivious to the world around me. Things were just so simple then, so easy. The only problems I had were learning how to fly, and getting Barney's autograph. Funny how things change.  Well not funny 'haha', more like 'ha,damn life sucks' funny.  I should really get over, well whatever my problem is.  I heard somewhere that there are only two kinds of people in this world. Those who stay up all night and cheerfully watch the Happy Days Marathons, and then there are those who stay up at night with tears in there eyes.  I never really got that until now (though i don't know why there can't be some kind of in between). Whats the point of being the Jan Brady to the worlds Marcia (i know, to much Nick at Nite for me).  Jesus, I really need some rest. Cause in a couple of ours, I'll be in school. And for some reason I think that this is the only time i'll be able to have some short of peace.
