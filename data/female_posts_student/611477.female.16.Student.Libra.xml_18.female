(apologies if that offends certain religions or political parties *g* )   Anyway, I made a couple washclothes last night/this morning but haven't taken a picture for some odd reason.  Now I'm making something akin to  urlLink this  - it's completely different except for mine still being entrelac. *g*  Hopefully it won't felt too weird, me using scraps like this.
