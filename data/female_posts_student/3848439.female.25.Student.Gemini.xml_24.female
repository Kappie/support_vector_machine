In the spirit of that phrase, when I got my new MacConnection catalogue - blasted junk mail! - I thought of a new word:  Tech porn.  Tech porn is the catelogues from OfficeMax, the gear reviews on reviews.CNET.com, the front page of the Apple website.    40 GB iPods! 5 Megapixel digital cameras! Portable LCD projectors with handheld wireless remote that reaches over 500 yards so you can wander during presentations!  I can't afford this stuff!  I don't even need this stuff!  But, sister, do I want this stuff!  I'm from a long line of gadget hounds; I can't even remember the number of PDA's and digital cameras my Dad's bought in the past 2 years.  Tech porn is a more specific subset of gadget porn.  A picture of a DLC-X Plus 20-cup capacity Cuisinart food processor in Martha Stewart Living is gadget porn.  If the processor has a Wi-Fi internet connection so you can command it to mix zucchini bread dough through the laptop you're using as you sip a light frappichino at Starbucks - that's tech porn.  And Steve Jobs is the number one pusher.
