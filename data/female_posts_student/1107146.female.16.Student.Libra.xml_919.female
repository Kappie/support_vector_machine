But hey, their specialty is "freedom" toast anyway, so I guess it's fine to eat something else, just like Waffle House is famous for hashbrowns, yet, is tenatively titled...WAFFLE...House. It beats the hell out of me.  T'was good seeing you today Ms. Reid, and I'll talk to you tomorrow (or today, depending on when you read this).
