FINALLY considering I started it last wednesday! I can't wait to work deep. Ok submerged concious and submerged unconcious victims in deep water are probably the hardest thing about lifeguarding. It is soooo soooo hard, unless you know what I am talking about you have no idea how hard it is. Submerged concious is not as hard as submerged unconcious. It took me sooo sooo long to get the unconcious victim, and even after I did I am still a little worried about ever having ot use it.   After that I went home took a shower and went to Curves with my mom, oh the fun that was. (said sarcastically) I mean it was ok, not horrible but I guess I am gunna stick with it.  After that I went to the beach with my mom got really really sunburned. I took a walk down the beach with the 2 girls i babysit they are both in second grade going into third. They are so funny. They collected dead, smelly, parts of crabs. It was fun though, they are really cute an really funny to listen to.  Ok I am really sunburned now so i am gunna go watch TV and rest for a long time. Maybe some more later I dont know yet.   ~~Mel~~
