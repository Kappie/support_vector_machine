It was the set day for the Futures program, an event at Georgia Tech for prospective female students which lasted all day, and I've determined that I am definitely applying. I absolutely LOVED Tech... If I don't go into music and therefore wind up within a mathematically involved field, I want to go there-- granted that I get in, that is. It's as though it were made for me; I realize that if I do wind up attending there, it will be a very rigorous scholastic experience that will allow me to have nearly no life, but it really seems like an awesome school (even after all the horror stories that some people from there have recounted).  I met a really cool girl from Texas who hung out with us throughout the day, and there was a really large amount of people from all over the country.  During the initial information session, a helium balloon set off a fire alarm, and we halfway evacuated until they realized that the culprit of setting it off was but a balloon. That was fairly amusing. My favourite speaker was a lady who was an Aerospace Engineer; she was very cool and very encouraging as well as foreign although, if she hadn't mentioned it, I would have never guessed her to be foreign. On the other hand, when we split up into groups by major, I was very confused. The program folks said that, were we to be interested in more than one major, we could divide our time into different sessions and simply move around. I wanted to go to both Engineering and Sciences, and, because Engineering was in a different building, I went there first. So, about halfway through Engineering, I left for Sciences, but, for some odd reason, Sciences ended half an hour earlier than it was supposed to, causing me to only catch the last ten minutes and then return to Engineering. The Engineering folks were cool, although the first speaker was obviously a hispanic woman with a nearly incomprehensible, strong accent- hence, I only caught about half of what she was saying. There was also a very nice professor, but she spoke entirely too softly, and from the rear end of the room, I could not hear a thing she was saying, which was a shame.  The only part I disliked about it was the President's Scholarship section of the day; two female representatives who had priorly received the scholarship spoke, and they were stupid, obnoxious, and entirely incompetent as far answering a question effectively goes although they were overly skilled at giggling incessantly for no reason. Ugh. I sincerely wanted to take my awesome Tech cup and throw it at one of them, hoping that the other would be stupid enough to run toward it and get hit, too.  The tour was pretty fun; although it wasn't as specific as I'd hoped (though I didn't expect anything incredibly specific in so little time) and I didn't get to sit in through any lectures, I saw "the beach" (hehe) and the horrible part of campus involving fraternities and sororities... *shivers* I really detested that part of the tour. Honestly, I didn't quite realize how many morons somehow managed to get into Tech. All the same, I'm a bit concerned about admission, but that's not something to worry about for a little while longer-- I've got other things to be thinking about right this very now.  It was funny to see some frightened expressions on students' faces, though. It seemed as though they had never seen that many females at once. At one point during break, I looked up and saw this dude gaping at me, and that was kind of weird. I think the tour guide, a sophomore engineer, was checking me out, but at least he was cute. That did make me a bit uncomfortable, so I just looked at the buildings, which was the purpose of the tour anyway.    All in all, I liked Tech a lot and felt as though it could be the right educational place for me (save for the frightening female:male ratio and the community restrooms).   Afterwards, I went to Lyndsey's, and her dad taught me how to shoot a rifle and a pistol. Wow-- pistols are really hard to shoot, and they bounce back entirely too much, but the rifle was pure fun. I was doing great, too. The very first shot I took, I hit the target (a can), which is something I'm very proud of. Right in the letter "o" of it, too! And at one point, I had about 10 or 11 consecutive successful shots... I like shooting entirely too much, hehe. I want to do it again. ( Not  on anything living, worry not!!!)   ^.^   Well, there's a lot to do today, involving mounds of makeup work for missing school yesterday (though it was totally worth it), so I'd better get started, or something of the like, anyway. Toodles!   "Neither Heaven nor Space" by Badly Drawn Boy   So quiet  It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Down there Where alot of people lie in a deep sleep  And months on end go by, in a single week  Down there  But much too slow  Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out, we're sinking much too low And if you sit long enough You can hear ghost trains As if the city speed Is just in our brains And coaxes close as we get to sugar cane Down there  But much too slow Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out we're sinking much too low So quiet So quiet It's neither heaven nor space It's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Neither of which I get enough of
