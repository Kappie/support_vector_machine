Maybe it's just something that happens, and we can't do a thing about it. Yet one thing I do know is that people are  AFRAID  of falling...  I can give you a million good reasons why many are afraid:  Heartbreaks , at both ends (to receive and to give),  commitment  and everything else...   The truth is, one should never be afraid of falling, especially if it is pure and true.   Falling means we have achieved something "High".  You coudn't fall on the ground from the ground...    When we fall, we are not sure of a "safety net" to catch us. Most of the time, many are sure to have no safety nets. The only possibility of us, being saved from the bone crushing, heart stopping, mind numbing impact is for someone, specifically, the one we would fall in love with, would catch us. On the other hand, take note that they may, but are  not obliged to , catch.  Well, still on the topic, but swerving a little, urequited love. Maybe one of the greatest forms of love. It is the love that does  EVERYTHING for NOTHING , and keeps on doing it. This is the type where, oftentimes, the giver is left wasted, lying all alone...   Oh well.. Moving on...
