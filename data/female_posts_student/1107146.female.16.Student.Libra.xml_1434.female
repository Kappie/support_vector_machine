The first one is now our sound guy, he didn't want to play in front of people, but he's awesome with sound works, and his dad is a big and famous session musician...so says the lady in Vintage on Bridge Street in Downtown Franklin.  And then there was JH and he decided he's too good for us and that he already has a band...tho Linds informs me that the "band" is more of a Nazareth-like cover band. So screw that plan.  I don't want Matt Leper because he's what we all call a "pecker"...too out there, won't stay on task, too much of a showoff, etc. ...  I don't know anyone else besides that. If this Phillip can jam and plays heavy stuff and wouldn't mind playing everything from Beatles to Bal Sagoth, we're willing to give him a try.
