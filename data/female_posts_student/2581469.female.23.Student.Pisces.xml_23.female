(i believe that my li'l town was a relay station during world war II.. if the U.S. was going to get bombed, we would send the information from the coast inland.. albeit we aren't exactly  on  the coast, we're close enough. anyway. there are still buildings up there. and old water towers. and radio station buildings that are all locked up.)  when i was growing up here, it was the ongoing urban myth sort of thing that people went up there to worship the devil. which was a scary concept back when i was 13. most of the abandoned buildings have been graffitied to death and there is plenty of evidence of parties and possible glue huffing, that sort of thing.. but no overly satanic business anywhere. but what do i know? i could just be naive about those goings-ons. the abandoned buildings are still scary at night. (remember that mike?) and i've even had a few run-back-to-your-car-oh-my-god-we-are-going-to-get-sacrificed-or-eaten-alive-or-dragged-to-the-underworld-by-ghosts incidents. of course it was my friend Buddy throwing rocks at the buildings. but i swear it sounded like gunshots. i swear.  but of course, like any monster, it's not as scary with the lights on. plus the view is spectacular. nevada's geology/geography is amazing. don't believe me?  urlLink  here's a map.
