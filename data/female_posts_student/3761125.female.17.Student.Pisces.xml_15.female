It's refreshing in a sense.  I saw Kristen there which was cool because I haven't seen her in a while.  She told me how grad went and now she's working at the cafe bookstore I love to go to.  I can't wait until I graduate next year, I really can't.  Tonight I'm going to see Spiderman 2 around 10.  Oh how I love late showings of movies.
