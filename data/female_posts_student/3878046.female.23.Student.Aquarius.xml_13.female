I don't even want you to like me (i mean it would be nice but who gives a fuck right?).  So i'm wondering if i should see this as some backfiring of my fuckup or whether it's entirely separate and therefore worse.  i don't need some complicated blah, but a hey would be nice, show that i didn't completely waste my time.  but maybe i just am that much of a loser.
