I LIKE AMBUHGUHS AND WOOT BEEA!  hamburger haus is hopefully on the slate for saturday.  :))))))))))  i think most of my friends have forgotten that it is my birthday on saturday.  oh well.  okay, so it's a little disappointing.  i don't forget their birthdays...but one can't expect reciprocation from a friend.  i don't really mention my birthday to anyone...i mean, what is it really worth?  a few more rights?  a few gifts from those who choose to remember?  queen/king for the day?  (not yet...)  anyway, it's not like it matters to anyone whether or not some obscure weirdo gives him/her a small gift...or takes him/her out to dinner...etc.  whatever.  i'm trying not to feel sorry for myself.  at least i have the peace of mind that i am a decent friend.  (a little egotistical at this point)
