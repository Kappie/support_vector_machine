In about in a hour, I'm going to Ashley's (see yesterday's post) and I'm sure I'm going to have a lot of fun. I wonder if Ashley's dog is going to tackle Mike again..haha..that was one of the funniest things ever! Tommorrow I'm hopefully going to work and then I'm going to Erie to finally see Spider Man 2! I'm really excited..everyone I've talked to who has seen it said it was awesome.  Feelings today was neutral..I'm not happy or sad..just blah. Other than that, things are going awesome! See ya later...
