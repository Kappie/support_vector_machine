Spiders, grasshoppers, ticks, you name it. So, as it was very realistic and I was pretty much asleep, I sit up and start furiously throwing covers off me and backing up off my bed. (You're probably laughing at me right now, haha Ariel's pyschotic and runs away from fake bugs in the night.) Here's the incredibly serious part... I backed up on my bed so much that I fell off head first and landed with a very loud and painful thud. And I screamed. But no one woke up and came to my rescue. Here it is probably 7 hours later, and I'm still shaking.
