From Uma and Bill, to the Punisher and now Denzel Washington in  Man on Fire , the summer blockbuster season is being preceded by the spring pay back season.  Like  Kill Bill ,  Man on Fire  is buoyed by a ferocious central performance.  Few actors today are able to simultaneously emote burning rage and a quiet coolness with the same charismatic integrity as Washington.  The first act and Washington’s scenes with little Dakota Fanning are the strongest.  Fanning is a peculiar child actor, despite her high voice, blond bob and baby blue eyes, she’s the most mature child star to ever grace the screen.  She uses that maturity to her advantage,  more convincing with a performer of Washington or former co-star Sean Penn’s caliber, than with another child actor or even the younger actress, Rhada Mitchell, playing her mother.  Fanning and Washington have a nice chemistry that elevates the somewhat underwritten relationship.  The rest of the film unfortunately is like  The Punisher , big blowups, an implausible plot line, and predictable twists.  Director Tony Scott thought using MTV-like camera work and quick cut editing, similar to that in  City of God , would pass as style but doesn’t.  Unlike  City of God , which used the style to illuminate the rise of MTV generation hoodlums, Scott's direction serves no purpose.  A perfect example is his use of subtitles to translate perfectly understandable English dialog.  Huh?  Where  Kill Bill  and the lovely revenge picture from a few years ago,  In the Bedroom , went right is their characters lost themselves cascading down a spiral of grief and confusion until vengance became the only way to regain their life.  For Creasy and the Punisher, grief was just an excuse to blow a lot of stuff up.
