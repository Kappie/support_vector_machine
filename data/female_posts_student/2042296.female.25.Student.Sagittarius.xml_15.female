Tomorrow I have to make some Finnish specialities and the day after tomorrow a little bit more. Rico's family is coming to our place on Thursday. After that I can relax ;) I've already been thinking, why I wanna do all this. But I just wanted to do some Finnish things, since I'm not able to go to Finland for Christmas.   I've already had some really bad moments when I've been homesick, but it always goes away. Those moments came, when I got the packages from my parents... I've never been away from Finland on Christmas. And the fact that my parents miss me, too, makes it even worse. On Christmas I am a real family person. I could never go away for Christmas, I mean to live in some hotel somewhere in Spain or whatever. Christmas is not the time for partying or getting pissed, it's time for calming down and so on. On New Year's Eve it's time to party etc. But I guess I'll just leave that, too. I'm getting old, I guess. I don't know, how it's gonna be tomorrow and on Thu but I think I'll be alright. Tomorrow we're gonna go and eat something with our friends Dani and Urs and like I said, on Thu we have Rico's family here. It's always so nice to see Dani and Urs, they're such nice guys.   Rico's mother is an angel, she went shopping with me yesterday, because Rico was ill and she paid at least the half of the things... I don't know, what I'd done without her. Today Rico was healthy again and we could go together to buy some things. I can't wait for Thu evening... Then at last I can relax and enjoy the peace. And do something nice with Rico.  Yeah, everything's like before with Rico. That is, everything's just fine, great I'd say.   So, I'm gonna go and hug that man of mine.
