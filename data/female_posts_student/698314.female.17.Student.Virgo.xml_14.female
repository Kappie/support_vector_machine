So what have I been up to since the last time I updated this thing... hm... The basketball camp ended Friday. That was.. hm.. how can I put this, Hell. There were so many boys and they didn't listen it was all just nuts. I'm glad I got my wistle because I lost my voice. It was fun though because of the other people that worked it. I liked spending time there with Miss C too, even if she did get mad at me for "beating my kids". I didn't really beat them, it just seemed it was all my kids getting hurt. Oh well... Now I'm working the North Hanover summer rec camp. It's alright. It's def not as much fun as it has been in the past years. I miss Brooks there. And now that Tawny's not there it's boring. yes, Matts there but we don't really talk during camp, its weird. There's a new guy in charge with Mr. Strons and well I just dunno if I like him yet. Oh well. We've already gone skating and today we're going golfing... we shall see. I've also been working. I'm begining to not really like kids that much. This is like perfect birth control. Yesterday after camp I met Mark, Andrea, (Andrea's sister) April, and Miss C at Tooties for icecream. That was fun. It always is a good time when we all get together. I'm gonna miss those guys. I'm not going to get into that though because it's another post all in itself. I saw the Notebook on Monday. It was really good. I didn't cry but everyone else did. We went to the 10:35 show because it was the only one I could make because of work. I didn't get home until 1:15. It was crazy, I was so tired for camp but it was worth it. I have to get going to camp now so......... later
