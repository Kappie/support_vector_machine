[Fast forward thru the unimportant details....] Then i watched Survivor [Amazon], the repeat [obviously].   Saw the clock and rushed to bathe.. bla bla bla   I went down to the bus stop. went to the minimart on my way and bought 8 days and lime, and oh, i saw Dick and Guo En there. Dick called out and im lik ok.. Then i heard Guo En say sumthin lik, "Eh, she in Chung Cheng meh?"   I got outta the store and didnt hear the rest of it.  bla bla bla...  ok, i dont feel lik goin on.. all in all, its a boring day  i'll get back when sumthin pisses me off and i get the kick to write.  |Let's start over, let's start over|I Feel So|BCR
