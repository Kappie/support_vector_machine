( YAY!). but we have to order it online so it may take a while.  my brother called me up last night and told me he's getting into playing his guitar some more. and wants me to write lyrics for him since i used to always write poetry and all that jazz. he said for me to go listen to alot of tantric and alice in chains... hhmm. i'm not sure if i have that much blatant rage, but hey- i'll try. i wish that week had never ended. i was alone. but i wasn't lonely. i wished i could have called someone, and had him come over. that would have been the only one i would have spent any time with. but hey- we'll just stick to our fantasies shall we. i went to the optomologist wednesday and talked to the doctor there. 8 to 10 fucking years of school to become an eye doctor... damn... i'll be 26 when i get out of school... sigh... c'est la vie. i need more time to be alone. it suits me better than trying to be something for everyone at every waking moment. not that i necessarily AM anything to anyone. but i try. i dont know why. or who it is i do it for. and who is it i try to lose weight for. who, now, will i attempt to look good for. in a week i got into the habit of doing what i want when i want and looking any damn way i pleased. thats what i miss. school is likely to kill you. ug. ug. ug. my mom just asked when i'm going to stop feeling sorry for myself. now's a good time to start.  "If you love somebody, let them go. If they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."               ouch...
