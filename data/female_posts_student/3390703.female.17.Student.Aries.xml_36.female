Lani had the most delicious taco thing I've ever tasted in my life, I'm in love!   The movie was so amazing, and Harry Potter got so hott!  I mean, I always thought he was cute, but now he is HOTT, sexy!  OW OW!  Ummm, the guy that played Syrus or something like that was the guy that played Sid in Sid and Nancy!  Ha, it was funny to see Sid get old!   The we went back to my house and we all hung out in my room and the madness with Nathan started, I don't want him to fucking touch me, and he wouldn't stop!  We walked to Karina's house, she wasn't home ... so we walked to Ryan's house, he had his girlfriend over!  Ahh!  I keep getting denied!  lol  I'm sleeping over at Lori's house and ... it's happy to be with her because I love her oh so much, but I'm miserable!  Everyone I do want love from is giving it to everyone else, and the one person I don't want it from is willing to give it!  I don't like it at all!  I don't like Nathan like that, and I'm sick of all of his lies!  I mean seriously, that is all he does!   And ... I don't feel liked by the guys!  I mean, I don't know ... I'm a very touchy, huggy person and when I don't get the affection I want I get really jealous!  Hmmm ... and I don't know ... I only really care about Bob!  I know I shouldn't care, but I do!  Then Lori was like well, I could talk to him!  But that would be stupid because what there is to be said won't help any!  "Stefanie likes you a lot, and you mean so much to her, even though she doesn't show it all the time.  She would do anything to make you feel the same way, but she can't, so she'll just waist her life being depressed about it!  The End!"  Wow, I'm sure that would help the situation TONS!
