I really appreciate what you've done sweetie. Fiona has also succeeded in hugging LNK. I could hear her heart thumping then. :D   Anyways, Kalyn, Ruth and I went for a jog at Bt Batok Nature Park this morning and we had such an awesome time sharing all our girly secrets. * Hush! * :P Exercising really does help to relieve stress and shed calories. Better if you're with your friends, because when you yak, you have no idea that you've actually ran 3.2km, and it seemed quite effortless, unlike those never-ending TAF runs. Haha! On a brighter note, Her Excellency,  Chiobu Chua  has been recruited into our  Calorie losing  and gaining them back later  gang . * Teehee * Thanks for the wonderful time spent at the park and in the library my dear girls - Ruth and Kalyn!    By the way, Ruth wrote me a beautiful quote from Shakespeare behind my foolscap paper. It's so  chim  I didn't understand, except for the phrase,  O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?     Thanks Geetha, Jess and Karen for the postcard! Siti Rahil, I am surprised about how you feel about me, thank you very much for the testimonial. It made my day. I love you all!
