I can't believe that nothing vaguely interesting has happened today....except for finding a 2p piece from the 'mother land' in the Arbarbanel's plughole!  I have just got back from going to the Hindu temple with my flatmate Rupal. Was interesting, strange, bizarre, cool, different.  Will blog more about it later maybe.  Haven't been successful with work today - oh dear!  I ought to get super-efficient, speed-demon platinumblonde on the case.....anyone else want to write something about a community health development project in the slums of Delhi? IT's SO interesting and what I'm really passionate about - I just hate having to fit it into these criteria and framework that some academic has created.  It makes it so theoretical and sucks the life out of the work that is being done.  Also a main part of the project is that it is run using a Christian philosophy and because of their demonstration of God's love for mankind.....can't exactly write about that in my essay.  take care guys
