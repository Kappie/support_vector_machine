Everybody is paying lip service to the cause, but you can see trusted allies acting out of self-interest. You wouldn't do anything like that unless you were pushed, would you? Take these quirks and foibles of human nature in stride. It's nothing personal. And even if someone is out to get you, you're not playing that game. You still have a lot of hard work ahead of you, and you'll handle it alone if necessary. You're strong and focused for this.    *AND*   Quickie: Think more deeply about this. No one's keeping secrets. The answer is within you.  Overview: Oh, you're trying to keep that secret a secret! But no one will be angry with you if the other parties concerned don't cooperate. Prepare yourself.
