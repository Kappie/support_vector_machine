We talked about how bad Jonathan used to act in math class and how I was very studious (lol, yea right)!! After Target we went to Wal-Mart! As we were walking through the fishing section, I proceeded to talk like a hick and acted like I new about bass, the fish not the stereo part!! ;-) These two guys looked at me like I was a stupid redneck, or one of their relatives! It was great fun, mainly because Jonathan was completely and totally embarassed!! After that we went over to walk at the Civic Center! I love summer nites, espcially when you're with cool people!! The ducks were quacking and the mosquitos were biting. But all in all it was a good nite. God has blessed me with incredible people in my life whome I can have fun with and laugh! Nothing could be better then playing on Concord Elem. School's playground at 10 o'clock at nite with a great friend! I LOVE MY LIFE!! Well I hope everyone's summer is going great!!  I love you all very much! :-)  Peace!  ~*~Anna
