From the clothes we wear to the things we say, the presence of pop culture has become the fundamental basis of today’s society of American youth. You can’t turn on the TV without seeing the freshest face in the pop world giving shout-outs to his peeps, or cringing at the latest music video from your little sister’s favorite tween star.   	The idolization of musical artists definitely has been a distinguishing attitude of the twentieth century, and will most likely be true of the twenty-first as well. Pop culture is so central in our lives as teenagers, and yet there are few who truly know where it originated. How did music get to be what it is today? The musical evolution of the twentieth century, for better or worse, is a subject altogether unknown to those who are the most involved in it. So here’s a new subject to dwell on the next time you block out your history lesson with your personal CD player.  The History of Rock n’ Roll: a course often forgotten in high school curriculum. Take your seats, class; time to learn something new. Keep those headphones on, young man!  	After World War II, the sound waves were dominated by swing and easy-listening, by artists such as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como. However, soon a new sound developed in the South, popularized on the Southern radio scene. Performed chiefly by black musicians, this new sound combined R, boogie-woogie and country music, and involved the guitar, bass, drums, the piano, vocals and sometimes even a saxophone or horn. In 1952, an influential Southern disc jockey Alan Freed dubbed it "rock and roll", then a black slang term for sex. Got your attention? Let’s continue…  	Racism was still a difficult issue in the fifties, so the then-black dominated genre never took off into the charts until white musicians had a go at it. Haley's 1955 smash "Rock Around the Clock" is widely cited as the commercial birth of rock and roll. And then came Elvis.  	Elvis Presley was one of the forefathers of rock and roll. Elvis became a phenomenon that swept the youth of 1950’s America like no other artist before him. He brought the sound into the mainstream and shattered the racial barriers surrounding the genre. Blacks were fans of the King of Rock and Roll, as he later became known, just as well as whites were fans of influential black artists such as Little Richard or Chuck Berry. This opened the door for the golden age of rock and roll.  	The early 1960s started out slowly in the music world, with exception of the Beach Boys’ now classic California-flavored pop. Soon however, Berry Gordy’s primarily black record-label Motown became an unstoppable force, churning out many now -legendary stars, following a hit-making formula that has become the foundation of popular American songwriting. Such artists included Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Diana Ross and the Supremes, and Stevie Wonder. Other influential artists of the 1960s were Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, Simon and Garfunkel, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and of course Bob Dylan, considered by many the greatest American lyricist.  The most significant effect on rock in the 1960s was the British Invasion, which included such artists as the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Yardbirds, and the Animals. This movement was led by disputably the greatest band of all time, the Beatles. The mop-topped boys from across the pond, Liverpudlians John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, became great innovators of rock and roll. Their early chart-topping fun and simple Chuck Berry-esque hits on "Help" or "A Hard Day’s Night" evolved into thoughtful psychedelic epic rock albums such as "Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band" or "Abbey Road", by the end of their legendary careers when the band split in 1970. Their influence is still greatly heard in the music of today.    The seventies were all together considered a musical dark ages of sorts, lead by the fun and popular but basically empty dance music, disco. The genre was not without its innovators, however: the Bee Gees, Donna Summer and K.C. and the Sunshine Band are all included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Disco not your style? Want something with a little more edge? If this is the case, you might have favored the 1970’s alternative to disco: punk. Disputably founded by the New York Dolls and pioneered by bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash, punk music remains relatively unchanged and is a ascendant of a lot of the music we hear today. Rock, in its purer state, lived on in the seventies with a new wave of rock gods such as Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin or AC/DC.   	In 1980, MTV emerged, making the eighties the video-age. The music video put artists in the spotlight, and in 2004 seems to have become as important as the music itself. In the eighties, the music video became an innovative art with the talents of Michael Jackson, who broke the racial barrier as the first widely played black artist on the music channel, and was by far the biggest star of the eighties; his rivals were Madonna and Prince. To touch on more artists of the eighties would be tiresome, as it was also the decade of the ‘one-hit-wonder.’ It was an eclectic age ranging from the artistic to the absurd; from gender-bending hair bands to the birth of the now ever-present boy –band (think New Kids on the Block, New Edition, or Menudo). New Wave, a descendent of punk, also took off in this era.  	Remember the nineties? We were barely in grade school when the grunge movement, headed by the now legendary Nirvana, started here in our own backyard. Rap in this decade quickly rose to the top of the music world, but that’s a different story. The boy -band, to the ecstatic joy of American pre-teens and to the disgust of music purists, was the most successful industry of this decade, as we all can recall.   Today, as we are now fairly involved in this decade of the new millennium, pop culture has reached new heights. Clothing lines by hip-hop moguls are worn in school halls throughout America, endorsement of soda by pop-stars are of the biggest business deals in the world, and you don’t have to have a hit song to have a hit music video. God Bless America! Whether we are about to enter another musical dark ages or waiting for an upcoming revolution, you can decide.   That concludes our broadcast day. Maybe now, with your new-found perception of rock, you can take a look through your parents old CDs and records and find out how cool (or uncool) they really were back in the day. Just don’t let them catch you putting their retro rock in your own collection! Peace out yo, fo’ shizzle. ________________  What do you guys think? It's way too long (supposed to be 300-500 words, more like 1300) but it's hard to make something like that any more vague than I did.
