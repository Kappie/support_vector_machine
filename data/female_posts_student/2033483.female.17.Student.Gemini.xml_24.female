All I have left is one retreat and an interview and I am as good as confirmed.  Hope to see ya'll at that party!  We only had two days of school this week on account of the Thanksgiving holiday.  I wish parentview would work so I could see what I got on my history test.  Wednesday was there.  Jessica, Megan, Renae and I went to the mall for the opening of Hollister, because yes, we are just that sad.  But it is so cool in there and I think it is actually bigger than the one in the Mall of America.  On Thursday, we went to Todd and Carol's for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was weird because my dad and my aunt Tami were called into work, my cousins Courtney and Jon didn't come and it was the first holiday since my Grandpa Jimmy died.  It didn't feel like Thanksgiving.  My relatives seriously annoyed me to the point of pissing me off with their constant questions of wether or not I had a boyfriend or a date to formal.  Quite frankly if I wanted them to know that stuff I would have told them now wouldn't have I.  On Friday, I slept in.  I don't see the point in shopping the day after Thanksgiving.  So I stayed home and helped my mom.    For the last week I've been sorta sick.  Every time I eat something I get sick.  So needless to say I haven't ate much in a week.  It's not that I'm not hungry it's just that when I eat I'll get sick.  It is a strange illness.    Today is Saturday and I have yet to complete any homework that was assigned on Tuesday.  Oh well I still have Sunday.  Tonight, I guess Renae and I'll go to the mall with Megan and Jessica if they ever call back.  Then we'll come back to my house and watch a movie.  This is what is planned for now, but for some reason the plan always changes.  It makes life a bit more interesting.  Kurt said he'd talk to me about tonight but so far he hasn't called.  Oh on a side note, I hope Ross asks AJ out soon b/c I'm getting sick of talking about it and hearing about it!   I wish my mom would get home so we could go to best buy.  I have a list of cds I want to get.  But I know as soon as I get them my mom will take them away and say they're for Christmas.  Damn that!    ~tata
