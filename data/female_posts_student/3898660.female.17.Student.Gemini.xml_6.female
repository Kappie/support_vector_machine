We keep thinking of where to go or where to have our dinner. I told him to decide as i dun wish to decide anything moreover i just woke up so my mind will be blank for the moment. We din meet cos i was tired and quite frustrated about it. End up, i felt guility after a few moments. I called him back :x and told him i wanna eat black noodles which is something i reckon is hokkien mee? no idea but who cares? lolx. We went to Hougang mall to have our dinner and i was pretty full so i din eat much and the rest of cos to my hubby's mouth. lolx. dun waste food so everything will gone case to my hubby's mouth :x After that, we went to hougang night market to buy some foods for his parents and den we headed to his house.
