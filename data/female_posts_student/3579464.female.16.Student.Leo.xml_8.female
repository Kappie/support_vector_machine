Here is Kristy's take on ADP:   Tuesday, July 06, 2004  ...So just a recap on my 2 weeks in St. Louis since i had no time to fill you in while i was there... sohere we go:  The first day i meet sam, who apparently was stalking me and knew i was the girl in the blue jacket... lol... and we hung out/ got to know each other... then we met hannah and immediately broke away from the large group... Then we go downstairs and ray comes over... and decides to form "the clique"... i knew ray would be so much fun to hang out with from the first moment we met him... he was so outgoing and loud, which was a good first impression.. so then we picked up some other randoms... including Ty... who has the all-time best accent ever .. especially when saying "Dont ya know"... Basically, we had such a fun time... and so many good memories.. the only sucky part was studio where no one talked and there were some disputes about the type of music that would be listened to... and classical did not win that vote.  So we definately had some fun times... like the baseball game (i guess you had to be there to see Sam and Ray being totally crazy, bowling with sandy's random commet... good one and me winning all of the bowling matches and beating everett by like a 100 points (yeah that did happen), ping pong, swimming, stealing Ty's shoes and watching sam fall, the walks back, definately the City museum, and the tours with the old guys... i guess the people there were just so awesome...  Im just now realizing how much im gonna miss the random things about ADP... sam exposing her cleavage (and getting a whole section in the slideshow for it), hannah's random stories, everett's singing and dancing, carlos' spanish translating/ making fun of my eye , dave and max being hilarious, the random kid.. haha..., everyone in studio getting pissed off, my cool roommates, taylor's dancing, graham's randomness, NINI, and i might just miss ray's comments about paris/ his grandmother... wow, hard to think i would miss that...  You guys really need to visit delaware/ meet me in the hampton's when i visit sam... and call/ im me all the time  Definately when you find out where you're going to college, hit me up because i might just be coming too... you never know ... wash u? virginia? miami?... i could be coming to a town near you...  And we are definately having a reunion... maybe in new york, or st. louis, maybe even the arch where we can get in the eggs again... and prepare beforehand... good times I
