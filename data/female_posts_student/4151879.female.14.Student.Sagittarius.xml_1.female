I'm going out tomorrow to put posters around the neighborhood. I won't tell you what they say or why, etc., but I promised myself I wouldn't tell and HEY.  Here I am. If you want to see them, drive down a few major streets in Rossmoor and you'll probably pass one or two. Don't tell anyone it was me.  ...The lead singer of Hoobastank's eyes are really far apart.  Uh...     RANDOM PICTURES OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE!      [Chris Thile]    [Callum Blue]    [Jason Mraz]    [Jamie Cullum]    [James Taylor.  Lotta names that start with J, I notice.]    ... Uh...     ...I'm sorry you had to see that.
