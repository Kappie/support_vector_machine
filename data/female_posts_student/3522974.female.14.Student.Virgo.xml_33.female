Coincidently, the exact breed of puppies that we were looking for happened to be there! Chihuahua x Jack Russell. They were sooo cute. There was two of them, cuddled up with each other in the corner. Together they were like the size of my hand. I fell in love instantly. The bad thing tho is that during the day on weekdays know one is home...soit would be very lonely. Then we thought 'bout buying the two of them but it would be quite expensive. Neway, we did our shopping then realised that we should foster them for the night. We went bak, but unfortunately they were already being fostered for 2nite. If they are still there next friday or saturday then we will foster them. Awww...i can't wait! LOluv CM
