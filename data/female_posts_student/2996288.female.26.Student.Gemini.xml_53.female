He's DNR (do not resuscitate), otherwise he'd have a tube down his throat and a machine making him breathe.  His entire family is here.  He's got metastatic lung cancer - he was a smoker.  Another of my patients, also with lung cancer, also from smoking, just had a CT scan that shows metastases to the liver.  Hepatic mets is one of the worst prognostic signs of lung cancer.  She'll be dead within a few months.  Today is not a good day to be my patient.  Now, I'm going to the dentist.
