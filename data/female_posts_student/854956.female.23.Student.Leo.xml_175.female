I came home from work REALLY sick... I just crawled into bed... totally skipped out on dinner... because I felt like I was going to ralph anyway... and I fell asleep at 7pm... I didn't wake up til 6ish this morning to get ready to go to class.  Upside to all this...?  I only had one class to worry about today... AND I got wonderful compliments from two of the guys in the music dept. on looking "hot."  That was great.  Those comments are few and far between.  Anyway, we jammed out on the piano, guitar, and me singing for about 30 minutes before our music theory test.  That was such fun! (and also very cliche of music people... :-\  Oh well)  So... we (and by we I mean Frank and I) came out of our theory test hoping to see some tacos (the music sorority sells them every Tuesday... hence the adopted name of Taco Tuesday!)....There were NO TACOS... and it was a TACO TUESDAY!!!  What in the name of sweet Jesus were those crazy sorority chicks thinking not having tacos for us?!?!  :-\  Oh well... on that note, I shall close... oh yeah, we had site evaluation today at work... it sucked balls...!  But on the good side, I got lots of flirt time in with Steve... hehe  Goodness...which apparently some of the kiddies picked up on... being that they told Steve he should make me a Valentine's Day card... it was cute, though!  hehe  I dunno... I probably flirt with him too much... and if I keep it up I'll end up with a crush on him... :-P  Okay... that's enough... more later.
