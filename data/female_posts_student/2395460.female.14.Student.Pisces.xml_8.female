Come  on . Anyway, "Chill" is about a dorky high school guy who becomes cool by swallowing a "squip", a pill-sized "super-computer". The computer tells him how to dress, what to say, you know, how to  be more chill . Yeah, I'm a little dubious but Amazon says it's "searingly witty" and "suprisingly poignant". All of Vezzini's  urlLink Squip Central  cluster of websites are obvious PR fabrication (yeah I know, I thought the butt skirts were real...) but I think the news byte about the Weitz Brothers (American Pie, About a Boy) signing on to make the film version is true. Looks like there are already some  urlLink Vezzini haters  and I guess I should actually read the book before I join in.  Thomas Berger's "Adventures of the Artificial Woman" looks much more promising. It's a Pygmalion tale of an animatronics technician who decides to build his dream wife. He's so successful in making her the ultimate woman that she leaves him to become a movie star, then seeks the Presidency. Sounds as dark and surreal as Berger's "The Houseguest", which I mostly enjoyed. I see this becoming a movie starring Apple Martin's mummy.
