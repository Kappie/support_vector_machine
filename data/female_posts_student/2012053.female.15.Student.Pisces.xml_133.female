LINDSEY!!" yeah, then i was right by it and it wasn't lindseys, and then i was very sad.  very, very, sad.  i am missing washington weather, friends and nice tennis courts.  WAH.  OH MY GRANDPA!!!  vvavavaavavvavavavaa  anyway. yesterday we were driving and i saw like the most beautiful thing EVER. it was like this meadow and it had fog over it and like fireflies blinking in and out of it. it was soooo pretty.
