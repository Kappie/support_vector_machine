Another + is that they're gone so now I can finally write here. I have not been able to write for so long because whenever I wanted to, someone was always looking over my shoulder. But anyway... News is as follows: My youth group leader is suddenly leading. I haven't been to youth group in a long time, but he suddenly decided that "God is calling me elsewhere" I am so mad at God for a lot of things right now... I gotta go...my family's home :(
