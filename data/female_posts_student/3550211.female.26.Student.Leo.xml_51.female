Enjoy  God you must be kidding me, thought this was supposed to be The home of the brave and the free - for you and me but now there's something wrong - shit's been going on too long. It's never gonna change, there's no way, so I say. What's the CIA and the NRA? They're all the same - just names are changed. Fuck - there's no excuse - any way you lose. It's all a joke in the good old USA.  All we need is more factories pumping filth into the sky. Corporate greed and perverted priests, it's the story of our lives. And apathy's the national disease and there is no end in sight. God save the USA - blame the president and say your prayers tonight.  The irony of liberty is no one here is truly free When elections are stolen by greed, the G.O.P. So watch the nightly news - find out how you are getting screwed. What you gonna do? - there's no use, so I say Fuck the industry - the aristocracy They're all the same - just names are changed. Fuck there's no excuse, any way you lose. It's all a joke in the good old USA.  [voice over] We have all been taught to believe that a world of greed, deceit, untruth, control is minimal. As long as we turn a blind a eye to the untruth we are fed the true power of freedom will never be known.  Government hypocrisy -American Idolatry - Corporate philosophy. Nightly news of tragedies - Where no one cares what's right or wrong Our heroes now are all long gone - The freedoms that we all abuse The obituaries front page news
