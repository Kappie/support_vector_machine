Have had another hectic day – finished off by collecting donations for Christian Aid (Its Christian Aid week and I volunteered for a street, where I dropped off envelopes at the start of the week and was returning to collect the money tonight) Is also quite challenging doing such things – good practice for facing criticism and avoiding feeling rejected!  Saw my CPN today – annoyingly useless as usual (maybe I should get her a stick of dynamite…..), and after telling her how much I learnt over Easter – at Spring Harvest and in Canada, and how well things were going she simply said ‘so things not too bad then’ – what encouragement and positive reinforcement!!! But didn’t let her get to me.    Its 9:30 and I’m going to watch ER from last night and be in bed by 11pm. I PROMISE. (I’ll let you know how well it goes tomorrow!) Tomorrow is also another WORK day – as long as my brain decides to co-operate – and so NO fiddling with blog is allowed – if you see any changes I give you permission to seriously reprimand me!   Goodnight folks.
