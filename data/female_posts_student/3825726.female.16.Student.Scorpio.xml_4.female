Went boating and innertubing and I have like 5 bruises, they're pretty tasty looking. I'm taking my written this Saturday and my drive next Saturday, it's about time I got around to it. Emily, Amanda, Carl, Marry, and Stina already got theirs! lol. Hey so I'm like 4-5 months slow.. i'm getting there! Haha. But OMG, I'm soooo happy! I was supposed to get this job for the entire sumemr, and then it turns out the opening wuz filled, then I heard this morning that I get a job for a month, which is cool, cuz if I don't have any money I can't drive my car anyways which would totally suk. How's work going for u Bailey? Hope everyone's having a blast this summer. The only downside is I have to wake up at like 5 everyday of the week! Aack! *pulls hair out* Hhhmm.... lol. Maybe one of these weekends I'll just throw a party for the hell of getting together yah? And where is the damn sun? Hehe, I wanna go to the beach! Hey well if anyone's bored and wants to pick my sad-ass up to go somewhere I am here! CALLLLLLL MEEEE! LMAO! Anyone seen Bailey lately? Well I gotta go do gay ass chores. LOVE YOU GUYS! ~Vicki
