I have a life to live and don't have that much time for being online and going on about my life here ;)   I have studied for a couple of weeks now and it's been good. I have 7 hours on latin per week and that's a LOT of work. But interesting at the same time. Yet, can't wait to get rid of it ;) I have only 3 courses of english and that bothers me a little. I attend the courses in literature and old english. The third course, phonetics and phonology, I try to do independently, I'm already excited what it'll become ;) Phonetics and phonology are interesting, but... We'll see. If I'm lucky I get the literature courses marked down without doing the course work. I namely have already done 4 literature courses in Finland and they also have 4 lit. courses here. I, however, plan to participate on the tuition since it's good preparation for the Zwischenpr√ºfung (intermediate exam, says the dictionary) which will be in two years. But not having to take the literature courses would be so great, cause I could begin with my minors earlier. So maybe I could get my studies done in about 5 years instead of 6.  I've also, of course, met some new people. I really enjoy my university life. And a university like the one in Zurich is just full of traditions and history... The main building alone is mighty.   Things at home are just disgustingly good. The cats are swell and the diet seems to work, at least Minka seems to have lost weight. She's now much more activ, too. They are enjoying the spring days on the balcony and chase the poor bees that are still a bit frozen and not that alert.  With Rico... I'll tell if something new happens ;D On Friday we had our 11-months-day and I actually didn't think about it till Rico came to wake me up and asked where the coffee is :D He wanted to make me espresso, but he didn't find the coffee. So sweet :) He then mentioned that it's really 11 months since we started the relationship... We had Moscato d'asti (a type of prosecco) and different kinds of cheeses and fresh buns for breakfast. The sun was shining and it was just so perfect. In the evening I made a delicious pasta sauce from cream, herbs and smoked salmon. We ate good and talked for hours in the candle light. All the free days we've now had together have been perfect. Being together, doing things, talking, watching movies, eating good food and drinking good wine with the food. We're so in love. The best place in this world is beside Rico. I feel safe and I still have my own life, I'm not too bound to him and I don't live for him only. I mean, I'd die for him, but not give away my life while I'm still alive. You know what I mean.  It's amazing how fast time goes on. In a month it's my and our first anniversary so to say. By then I've spent a year here and we've been that long together. Wow.  But, I gotta go. We're gonna have dinner at Rico's mother. Can't wait :) Happy Easter, every one!
