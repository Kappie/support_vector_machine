My monitor broke down, and even now I'm borrowing the monitor from my brother's pc... Sad... Gonna get me a new one..  I have been busy working as a temp sales promoter at a jewellery shop called Sentiments.. Life is pretty hectic but at the same time i enjoy working there.. Meeting all sorts of customers has made me more streetwise and flexible when interacting with people... Though there was one glitch! I totally couldn't stand a colleague of mine, N! She is damn irritating, always talking about guys and trying to put me down.. Well, I know that I'm much better than u, so talk to the hand baby! but i am just so fascinated with her naiviety sometimes.. She really thinks that having a boyfriend would change her life.. She is one of those loner types of people with no friends.. Well, ok I shall stop talking about other people...   I finally had decided on breaking up with Don ONCE AND FOR ALL. No more chances... What is the point of being in a relationship where none of us is happy? I am moving on, and this time I really mean it.. I'm actually quite surprised that I am taking it pretty well.. I don't feel that hurt anymore.. I feel numb.. And I am looking forward to being a singleton again! Being an individual, having complete control and freedom of my life.. Not having to explain every single thing that I do.. No more quarrels, no more nagging, no more being put down.. No more feeling guilty and thinking that I am the cause of all problems.. I guess that is life, you lose some, you gain some..  Anyway I had my eyebrows trimed, a new hairstyle and a facial with compliments from my mom!  My sista has been really supportive too... She has made me realise how foolish I was going round in circles. I thought about what she said, and the conversation we had made me wake up from my nightmare.. She has been always there for me.. Thanks!  I know that even without Don, I do have people who love me.. I am not alone.. =) Smiles..   Gotta go have my breakfast then go off to work! See ya!
