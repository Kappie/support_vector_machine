Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba  St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre   I've also been in the market for a muse...  Anyways. Jane. I would smack him if I were you. Who ever said physical violence can't solve anything was right, however in the situation...a smack to the head only helps clear the fuck thats stored up there thats rotting away at his grey matter.  I wasn't good last night. Thank you Sachin for helping me...and I'm sorry for scaring you.  I worked. I'm tired. I'm going to lay in bed,  but first...something thats on my mind lately.   Things I'm grateful for:   -my friends -my family -people who love me -people I love -shag carpet (natures vaccum) -warm blankets -lanudry soap -silver -random acts of affection -poetic music -black -you
