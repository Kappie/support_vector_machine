I have no idea when they're gonna reschedule it, and frankly, i don't care.  it was just a pain having to get up in the morning though, and because i didn't look at the weather, i actually left my apartment and walked in the damn cold.  i should really start watching the news again, huh?  Just to ensure that nothing like this happens again.    Been trying to do the english project.  I'm not sure if it's working out or not.  You know what's funny summer?  Delilah, who has been "in charge" of everything and kinda setting stuff up, hasn't been doing her part.  Atleast not yet anyway.  Maybe i've spoken too soon.  But the plan was to get everything in by saturday night, and lo and behold, it's saturday night.  hmm...  And it's cold, just to let all you know and such.  So make sure to have heat one, or take a niiiiiice looooooong bath.  That was what i did at 3 in the afternoon today.  And it was wonderful.  Never felt warmer in all my life.  BLISS!  (read in infomercial voice-) "A small moment of bliss is only a couple of steps away.  Go now! "
