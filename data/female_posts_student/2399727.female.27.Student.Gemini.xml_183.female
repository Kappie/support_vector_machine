He is recently emeritus, so his age isn't terribly difficult to ascertain.  Instead of proceeding into class as usual, we had to wait for a seminar before us to wrap up.  Growing more impatient as the minutes before our class dwindled, he decided he'd go in and hint to the seminar folks that their time was up.  I wasn't so keen to interrupt them, so I stood waiting in the hall and he brushed past me to get into the room. As he walked past me, he caught my eye and gave me a little wink as he walked into the classroom.  I smiled back at him (internally thinking things different to my external reaction!) and had to prevent myself from doubling over with laughter when he in his ueber-coolness, carrying his computer on one shoulder and a coffee in the opposite hand, got stuck in the heavy door and dropped everything to the floor except his coffee cup.  Walk on, cool man.  More to come...
