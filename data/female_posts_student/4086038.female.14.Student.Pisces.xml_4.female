I dunno... argh  I'm really glad that people DO care for me and they care for me ALOT. Just really grateful because I still have a reason to live in this crazy world.  Still feel like shit. Have to lay down and rest. Still have lots of homework... oh fuck... gotta go anyway...  PARDON MY CUSSING... JUST FEEL REALLY BAD RIGHT NOW
