Two, he was mad at M for being a dick, which means being himself. Three, G did like me when he broke up with me, it just wasnt working out because we couldn't drive. What I'm wondering now that since that has changed, whether his feelings are changed. Probably not. But the weird thing is that G hasn't dated anyone else since, or hasnt even caught on to liking someone. But its funny how we both have matured over that year and a half. we can talk to each other now, the conversation flows and the convos get deep. sort of. ive learned how to talk to people, im not so quiet and shut up anymore. i know how to flirt consciously, i know what sort of things can make a guy happy. it comes with having an 18 year old bf for a year and going far. G, well, havent really talked to him a lot in the past year or so. But i bet that if he had a girlfriend he would make the first move. I also think he would have no trouble talking to her, and I bet she would have no problem talking to him. its nice having him as a friend again. I remember him being easy to talk to at some points. But that easy? No, I think things have changed. We have matured. Amazing, isnt it? So many memories rush back to me. Lord of the Rings 1--we were alone, and boy was that awkward. I think thats when things began going downward. Oh well. The Brotherhood, Becca made us watch it. More awkward than comfortable, a lot more bad than good. Oh Spiderman. And really one of the good turning points of the relationship--bowling at the Bowladrome, the first time he put his arm around me, the day I thought there was a death wish on me b/c of that. Then the new years eve party at L's. Sitting on his lap b/c of no more room on the couch. Well at least now I know the correct way to sit on a guy's lap. Playing truth of dare--but never being able to act out the dare because I was too prudent, too nervous, too scared--suck on G's finger...oh how innocent we were sophomore year, how everything seemed so giant and scary. Sex was forbidden, kissing seemed unnatural, and boyfriends lasted approx. 2 months. Yes how young and innocent we were. Pure and naive, adolescent at its prime. But we are that no more. And we will never be like that again. but thats ok, getting older is a process of life, and kissing is quite fun, its too bad I haven't gotten one in almost 5 months. Maybe my luck will change, maybe kisses are just around the corner...Who knows, only we decide the future.                                                          Love, Me
