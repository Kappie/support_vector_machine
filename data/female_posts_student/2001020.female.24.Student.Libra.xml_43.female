I feel satisfied with the test I took today (my first in law school!) and I am listening to a great CD (the new Beck CD) and I just "clumsily strummed my guitar" (as I've always wanted to since Jewel said it). So...it's good. I'm single, I'm fine with that. There is a boy that I want to date, but it won't happen. Don't foresee that happening whatsoever. And...my friends are wonderful, both the ones from home and school. Law school is a bit lonely, but I'll deal. I'm so tired, I may just crash early tonight as my reward for working so hard. Or maybe I'll just hang up clothes until I pass out. Yeah. See ya later.
