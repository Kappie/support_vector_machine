Chris Columbus is a competent, soothing director who makes films for small children but isn't of the caliber to make childrens films that appeal to all ages, like  Shrek .  I enjoyed the first two films, which were too long and too chapter like, not because of the direction but due to J.K. Rowlings overwhelming love and passion for Harry, Hogwarts and her magical imagination.  The third film, by Alfons Cuaron, is darker, moodier and more film like.  Rather that force the audience to sit through the end of the school year, the film ends when it should- after the climax.  The third installment also rewards us by not lingering at Harry's aunt and uncle.  In this installment Harry is angrier, lonlier and beginning to assert himself and the film reflects that.  It took three films but the character is starting to grow.  Like its predecesors the film is still a bit too long, but the performances are enjoyable, David Thewliss brought a nice melancholy to the picture and Emma Thompson lit up every second of her too brief appearance.  As Dumbledoor, Richard Harris left almost unfillable shoes.  Sadly Michael Gambon, lacking the other worldlyness and fragility, opts to play the greatest wizard of all as an eccentric, bumbling old man.  The character needs more authority, like say what Ian McCelan brought to the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy.   I'm not yet a rabid fan, the story needs to find something deeper and more universal to say, but appreciate it's creativity.  Rowlings world and characters are as thorough and personal as you'll find in popular culture.  In a summer of one dimensional characters and half hearted executions that's saying something.
