I'm Ron/Hermione and Harry/Luna, and I don't want anybody trying to change MY mind. I wouldn't do it to you.   Required reading:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/19232.html    Must-read reading:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/35085.html    And this is the best:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/45103.html      If you want my opinion, all those posts are SPOT-ON. Romantic relationships need FOUNDATIONS and GROUNDWORK laid. I'm pretty damn sure that Rowling has been plotting and laying groundwork already, and she's not just going to stick Hermione with Harry. There are absolutely NO sparks, and I would consider it boring. Ron and Hermione, though, are sparking every moment of their sparky lives. Like Angua said, one person does not have to be your everything. Harry needs LOTS of people to help him, and Hermione just isn't strong enough to handle it all on her own. Harry needs someone to make him laugh and keep him grounded, and I think Hermione needs that too ... so it's kind of a dead end. She can find it in Ron, though, and Harry can look elsewhere.  "But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light. 'Hermione, Neville's right - you ARE a girl...'" Then he's totally desperate to know who she's going to the ball with. And then when he finds out, he won't stop harassing her about Krum and what a loser (he thinks) he is. All he watches during the dance is Krum and Hermione. (Just like Harry watched Cho and Cedric.) JEAL.OUS. JEAL.OUS. JEAL.OUS. So yeah, he might be going about it the wrong way, but face it, at this point he's still an immature teenage guy. What the hell does he know?  I will also quote Goblet of Fire, page 316 of American hardcover. "Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around the library when Hermione was your best friend."  I think that speaks for itself.
