We had the school to ourselves for the entirety of a Saturday. Starting at 6AM. Oh boy. It was pretty exciting though, having drama companies that were full of kids that were EXACTLY LIKE US only from Ashland, or Reading, or something. There were six schools there, ours included, and we hung out acting like idiots for a while. Then, we grouped off into workshops where we learned about improv, stage combat, character development, and dance. We ate lunch (thank you, Subway) and we sat in the auditorium watching each others' plays for HOURS. It was really amazing. Our play, the one we would soon be taking to the Massachusetts High School Drama Guild Festival, was  Creation of the World and Other Business , by Arthur Miller. It seriously kicked ass. This drama company is the only thing I will be conceited about in my life. It's  that  awesome. Anyway, after the plays, we all gathered back in the cafeteria for a pizza party/dance thing. I met a few really awesme guys. One of them was adoreable, and I ran outside before he got on his bus to leave in the freezing cold in a tank top to get his screenname. I then found out he had a girlfriend, but it's been really cool to talk to him anyway, hes a good guy.  We took the show to prelims, and we didn't move on. One of the judges had us as her #1 choice, but the two of them couldn't agree on which plays to send on to semi-finals, so they didn't send any of their top three choices. That's bull, but we loved our play, and everyone else did, and we are incredibly proud of everyone. Sorry, I sound like Suzie Sunshine or something, but we had too much fun to be sad about the experience. Fun, fun time. The handcuffs only heightened the fun.  O:)  Now we're working on  Fiddler on the Roof , and trust me, it will be worth seeing, so come if you can. I'm only ensemble, a "daughter", but I'm havin a blast, and our main cast is so cool. I love you guys.  I saw my mom's play at New Rep,  Threepenny Opera . A very weird show, but it was so, so great. This is the same group of people (mostly) who put on the production of  Sweeney Todd  last year, which my mom also worked on, and that was THE best peice of theatrical art I have ever experienced. Hey, I'm not the only one who thought so. It recently won, like, 10 Ernies.  I'll keep you updated. I think now I'm supposed to say something along the lines of "Go Drama". So... Go Drama.  Ok, that sounds stupid. You get the idea.
