Just felt like doing that, YAY HOLIDAYS!!! woohoo! although it doesnt really feel like holidays just yet because I'm performing today/tonight and also cause i had a rehersal last night, Rehersal was pretty wicked (believe it or not!)I made friends with pretty much everyone there haha mind you thats not that hard considering we all have a basic interest of performing etc so like whenever you have an awkward silence you can talk about drama... and then eventually get on to the topic of lesbian  dancing/kissing scenes... Samboka (im not sure if i can spell that yet) and also many many MANY other very random topics that only whacked out performing people who have been stuck in a room with no air con-fucking-ditioning with other whacked out performing people for like 5 hours can talk about! Great! Hmm today im performing.. TWICE! haha i hope my voice doesn't pack out in the middle of a song! *Runs to my pantry to take ALL the cough lollies* Oh i have my period.. got it last night.. which i am surprisingly happy about.. cause this means it wont just randomly pop up on me on the night of  the ball.. which would really suck cock in a big way! Alright i better  get going.. shower.. get my ass in  to town... rehearse.. perform.. shop.. perform.. go home!! :D and hopefully talk to dave.. but meh :p he'll  most likely be out! Toodooloo! xoxo
