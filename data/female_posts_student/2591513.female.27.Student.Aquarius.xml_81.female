I was looking at the pictures and was a little disgusted to see how much I let myself go.  I think for the most part it is all the stress I have been dealing with.  I just am too tired to do anything.  I need to change that.  It is a hard thing to change though, but I want and need to do something before it gets to the point where I can't do anything about it.  Anyway, our "cousin" Leslie looked absolutely beautiful.  She married into a very nice family.  I think they will be happy for a long time.  I hope God continues to bless them and that they have a baby to welcome soon.  I think that would be a great blessing.  Life here is all the same, Ed has leave, he is in btween commands, so it is nice to be around him.  I can't get enough of his presence.  You would think I would go crazy...because truthfully, he presses my buttons like no other, but I love him completely.  He and the kids are everything to me.  I haven't heard from my friends in northern Cal, but I guess they are busy.  It sucks, I wanted to see them.  I guess that won't happen.  Oh well.  I hope they are both doing well.  I miss them.  It is so weird not being able to talk to talk to them.  But I know that is how life goes, people go their separate ways.  i just didn't think it would happen to us.  My Auntie Pistang died.  I was sad.  She was a cousin of my dad's.  He respected her and loved her.  I think he is saddened and hopes for nothing but happiness in heaven.  She took care of her family and I know that God has a special place for her.  My papa is coming home soon!  I can't wait.  I miss him.  Of course he drives me crazy, but he loves me and he worries about me.  I know this much.  Well I hope you are all having a great week.
